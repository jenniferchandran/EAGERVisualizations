Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521066,"A few months shy of four years ago, my son gave me a book with the following inscription:""Happy Birthday and Happy Father's Day! I thought I'd get you something that might spark some ideas for adventures in the future. I know whenever I finish a camping trip I'm always excited for the next. Hopefully you'll feel the same way after Acadia! I can't wait to share my love for backpacking with you. I'm truly looking forward to it.""Camping in Acadia was fantastic. There have been more camping adventures and more books and journals have been read.This adventure is about to begin.",,Heading towards Springer Mountain,"Feb 12, Fri",0
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521131,"I really don't remember how trailjournals.com became a source of endless fascination for me. But I am so glad that it did. So many hikers have written phenomenal accounts of their joys and struggles. My sincere thanks and congratulations goes to each and every one of them as I wouldn't have gotten here without them. Those that I couldn't stop reading and strongly encourage you to consider reading too include Gangsta (2009), Chin Music (2013), Reset (2015), Airlock (2015), Axon & Shrugs (2015), Lucky (2015), and Red Panda (2015).While dropping off resupply packages today I met Baltimore Jack. I wish someone had a picture of my face as I learned who was taking time to speak with me. I know the smile on my face was a big one. I haven't even gotten to the starting point yet and I've already met a 9-time AT thru-hiker who shares his love of the AT so freely in person and on whiteblaze.net, another great source of info about hiking.I am very fortunate to be here. The humor shared with Beth, Anne, David, and those other ""friends"" and relatives who took every opportunity to poke fun at me today made today so memorable.",,Dahlonega,"Feb 13, Sat",0
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521199,"Happy Valentines Day??? Yesterday's supply box drops took approximately 9 hours resulting in the hotel stay in Dahlonega. So this morning began with a decision needed about where to go to start the AT - Springer Mountain or Amicalola Falls. Springer Mountain is the AT starting point but some take the Approach Trail to walk to Springer Mountain while others use USFS 42 where a parking lot provides a 1-mile hike south to Springer. Either one gets the hike underway.It didn't seem right for Beth to have driven me here and not see the starting point. Storm Olympia was also to begin during the next 24 hours. So off we went to Springer Moutain. Signage and Duffy were the first hikers we met followed by Fast Eddie, Nick, and David. Signage and Fast Eddie are also writing on Trailjournals and Beth had read Signage's entries earlier in the morning. Duffy works at Hiker Hostel where I am staying tonight. The enthusiasm exchanged on the trail is genuine. After taking a quick look at my backpack, many dayhikers extended best wishes for my AT trek. Pictures were taken at Springer and the vibe was good. I'll admit to taking a big gulp at the thought of what lies ahead but that was offset by the spark of adventure.I wasn't ready for what came next. Saying goodbye to Beth was very hard. No doubt I've been in denial about not being with her. Preparation with the gear accumulated as we began dayhikng together the last few years was fun. This year's tax returns are done too. The trip here was long but we've shared so many enjoyable long car rides before so the trip down also seemed familiar. But Beth was driving away and we wouldn't be together tonight. I hadn't prepared for this and Beth hadn't either. To anyone considering this adventure, get a grip on being away from your loved one before you say goodbye in a parking lot. Happy Valentines Day??? No, not this one. This one left me reeling as Beth drove away.",,Hiker Hostel,"Feb 14, Sun",0
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521245,"Storm Olympia came through today. Enduring weather is a requirement of a thru-hike but it didn't make sense to start my hike on such a miserable day. So today was spent at Hiker Hostel and what a great decision staying here turned out to be.Hikers about to start their hikes include Colin, Buzzworm, Tim & Molly, Tyler, and a few others I am just meeting. Hikers who began their hikes before the storm and who came in for comfortable shelter include Matt, Fast Eddie, and a mom with two of her family. As the day progresses the mom somewhat reluctantly shows a picture of last year's hike. The picture is of the leg she broke in 3 places while climbing Roan Mountain. She is back again restarting their thru-hike. She hiked out from Roan herself. She reminds me of my beloved Aunt Alice who broke her leg while out on a group hike. As I recall she hiked herself back to the group's boat and was embarrassed beyond belief when she was greeted by many as the boat docked with a rescue crew awaiting her arrival. I can hear Aunt Alice laughing right now and look forward to spending time sharing stories after my hike ends. Hope I can be as tough as these two women and realize that my staying in today suggests something other than that.I am meeting so many great people. The laughter and sharing during tonight's pack shakedown was very enjoyable and has me hoping and wondering about meeting up with these new acquaintances down the trail. Hiker Hostel is an incredible stay; owned and operated by former thru-hikers who are so at ease with their guests. Put a stay here on your list of what you want to experience on your thru-hike or if you come to this area.Sorry this ran a bit long. As Gangsta wrote ""this will be a memory some day"" and it serves as another reminder of how lucky I am to be here doing this.",,Hiker Hostel,"Feb 15, Mon",0
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521316,"My hike began today. Josh, one of the owners of the Hiker Hostel, drove me to Amicalola Falls State Park. I love waterfalls and this one was too close to pass up even if it meant hiking an extra 7.3 miles to get to the top of Springer Mountain. Yesterday's storm left the trail consistently wet with occasional slushy remnants. The temperature must have gotten into the mid-forties because I hiked in a t-shirt and a long sleeve wool shirt. Pretty great weather for the middle of February. Along today's trail I met Morgan, a young man from Florida. Tonight I am sleeping in a nice three-sided shelter, specifically Stover Creek Shelter. This will be my first night in a shelter and I am sharing it with four men while others are in three tents. It is 6:45 so darkness will bring an early sleep followed by an endless night, as I am sure I won't be able to sleep until tomorrow's daybreak. It just began raining so it is good to be in a shelter tonight. Temperature is expected to be near freezing so I am bundled up in layers of down and wool.Thanks to everyone who has sent me good wishes. Trust me when I say that your encouraging words give me a lift. With so many thinking about me today, I found myself thinking about so many of you who have meant so much to me. I also find myself thinking about the people I just met, notably Subman and Suds, Kris, Steve, Morgan, and a kind man who gave me water he had already treated. Hiking solo today gave me lots of time for reflection. My college chaplain often said ""Say a prayer for those you love, and for those nobody loves."" I have so much to be thankful for. Thanks to all of you.","Hiker Hostel

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521332,"So much happened today. Minutes after beginning to hike this morning, I was tempted to stop to take a picture. Then a few minutes later, I was tempted to take another one. It's no wonder more hikers don't complete a thru-hike; there's too much beauty to stop and enjoy.I caught up with Kris, who I am pretty sure is about to embrace a trail name of ""76"" or ""Spirit of 76"". The conversation and pace we shared flowed easily. I feel that I have already found a new friend. We caught up to Subman and Suds midday. Subman admitted that he was the artist who used his hiking pole to draw a heart in the AT trail. He does this for Suds as he often hikes ahead of her during the day. The banter between the two of them is so engaging. Subman thru-hiked in 2003 and knows this part of the trail so well that he doesn't need a guidebook. He opened our eyes to changes in the trail since his original thru-hike.As Spirit of 76 and I passed Horse Gap today, we came across a disappointed hiker whose hike for this year is probably over. His friend had just arrived to take him to get an MRI on his knee. It served as a reminder of the toll this hike can take on you. But then after another climb came my first trail magic from Trail Chef. As Trail Chef provided for Spirit of 76 and me, I realized that the couple of packs nearby belonged to Subman and Suds. Caught red-handed in Trail Chef's car were the two of them getting warmed up. It turns out that Subman uses a GPS ""Spot"" device that Trail Chef was following. Trail Chef drove 2.5 hours to surprise Subman and Suds with this trail magic - how cool is that! But there was more. As we were talking, Trail Chef revealed that his previous thru-hike had stopped in Athens, VA - but the good news was that he plans to pick it up there again. The departure of one hiker and awareness of another's intent to pick it up again felt good.Long Creek Falls was beautiful. There is no distance indicating how far away it is, but it turned out to be just a few hundred yards around the corner. Taking in sights like Long Creek Falls make this AT hike so special. I need to remember to take these side journeys in order to optimize this adventure. Thanks to Spirit of 76 for leading the way there.Tonight I am tenting at Gooch Mountain Shelter. This is a first for me in that my son, David, isn't tenting a few feet away. Tenting not too far away are Spirit of 76, Subman and Suds, and Fast Eddie. There are many others here too, including Colin, Buzzworm, and Tyler - hikers I met during my Hiker Hostel stay. The shelter was filled when we arrived and some of us are tenting on slopes as all the flat tent site areas are already being used. A number of us are wondering where everyone will fit when March brings an expected 75 - 100 hikers a day in what is routinely referred to as the ""bubble"".No rain is forecast tonight. The wind has died down. The moon is shining brightly. I am tucked in under a down quilt wearing lots of clothes but feeling surprisingly warm. Another great day out here and hoping for more to come.","Stover Creek Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521456,"Hard to believe that a 27 degree night could be so comfortable. Subman started the morning with a proposal to share a cabin between the three of us with his intention of filling the cabin with four of us. Given that this is our third day, a hike of more than 10 miles is beyond the norm from the perspective of easing into mileage per day. Subman's proposal meant a 15.9 mile hike but since this was my initial plan, I readily agreed. This decision meant separating ourselves from Spirit of 76 because Spirit didn't want to go that far today. It must seem odd to read about it being difficult to separate from someone you just met the day before, but believe me that it was. Hiking for hours together. Stopping to catch your breath on an uphill. Taking in the beauty around you as it changes from you viewing it from below and then either being level with it or above it. Combine all those shared experiences with pretty continual conversation about your lives, it really presents a sense of sadness to know your decision is responsible for the separation. So we exchanged a hug and admitted that we were each other's first AT friend, exchanged contact info, and agreed that we hoped the AT would bring us together again somewhere down the trail.So off we go - which was more like where did they go? Subman successfully thru-hiked in 2003. He and Suds each do their tasks and they get going quickly. Me? I don't mean to go slow but the reality is that I am slow. So while I was getting water to filter from the spring-fed tube, they were on their way. Fortunately, I caught up with them. Subman has hiked his home state of Georgia so often that he can talk about what is coming up with ease. I kept asking if we were on pace to get to Neel Gap and he kept saying that we were so I didn't worry about making it.Subman said they intended to dry their tent on Preacher Rock so we agreed to meet there and assess our progress. Preacher Rock turned out to be a pulpit of sorts as it provides an inspiring 180 degree view on a beautiful sunny day. My thoughts quickly turned to my deceased Dad because he was a Presbyterian minister. It was a special moment for me. I can't fully understand how being so far away from someone just seems to melt away as you hike in solitude, but it happens.Our group was formed with the addition of Papa Monkey. We're calling ourselves the TrailJournals Crew because all of us are posting regularly on TrailJournals. I had a resupply box at Neel Gap's Mountain Crossing store - so I took off trying to get there before it closed at 5:00. I think I had it until I saw a blue blaze and had to turn around to get back on the AT's white blazes. Nuts, I wasn't lost after all, but I lost time going back to make sure I was still on the AT. Compounding my concern was that I had to go up next over Blood Moutain en route to Neel Gap. Further of concern was daylight ending sometime after 6:00. And just to create more concern - is that a baby bear's track pretty consistently appearing on the trail to Blood Mountain? Okay, so Papa Monkey and Suds both got a laugh at my expense - it was a dog's footprint, not a bear's. I know - I am dumb.Blood Mountain was incredible. I have to get back here again to share the 360 degree views with my family. The trees don't have leaves yet. There are multiple spots that are stunning. Both of my children are now thinking - Okay Dad, take a panoramic photo like we showed you. I mistakenly drained the cell phone battery earlier this morning as I was getting ready to start the day's hike. I know - I'm dumb.So I didn't get to Neel Gap until 5:20. Pretzel, a thru-hiker of the AT and PCT who works at Mountain Crossing, retrieved it for me after hours. Nice, interesting guy. He looked at my backpack in a way that I've seen before. More about that tomorrow.The TrailJournals Crew all safely got to Neel Gap. Subman got us a cabin for $72 at Blood Mountain Cabins, specifically Rabbit cabin. Heads up to future hikers. Split 4-ways, a cabin here is a steal. It is literally less than a 5-minute hike from Neel Gap.What a day. Does my way always have to be the dumb way? I am having a blast taking this all in. The people, the scenery, the exercise - it's all good.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521457,"Blood Mountain Cabin was great last night. First stop was Mountain Crossings to send home stuff that I am not using and can now avoid carrying. Jason spotted my pack problem first. It isn't ""my pack's"" problem, it's me. So I learned that there is a third set of straps to use and tighten. What a difference they make. Here I thought my shoulder problem was my lack of any upper mass or strength (Okay, that is a ""problem"" but not one Jason can fix.)So with my backpack now carrying the way it can, I felt great with today's climb. Yesterday's sore shoulder and right baby toe were no longer ""talking"" to me.Subman yelled to me to let me know that he had a trail name for me - ""Rabbit"". Did I like it? Yes, for a number of reasons.(1) - Subman, a successful 2003 thru-hiker, gave it to me. He said that I'll have to live up to it now. Seems he thinks I move fairly well for Day 4. It's an honor for my trail name to come from him.(2) - Rabbit was the name of the cabin our TrailJournals crew stayed in last night so this name will remind me about that good night with Subman, Suds, and Papa Monkey.(3) - Rabbit starts with an ""R"" and that coincides with my full name as my first name's ""R"" pertains to my Dad, my middle name's ""R"" pertains to my GrandDad, and my last name's ""R"" came from my Grandpa. Rabbit seems to go with my name.(4) - Papa Monkey heard about it and said it makes sense. I had told him I had big ears like a rabbit has and he agreed because I was hearing him speaking with Suds last night even though they weren't that close to me.(5) - Reality is that I have ""BIG"" ears physically, like some rabbits have. So Rabbit it is.I met someone new today who said she didn't like the name she was given by others. I told her not to embrace it then. Periodically, I found myself thinking about her being a geologist and what could come of that. She came into our night's shelter area and I yelled out ""Gem!"" She looked at me with that ""what are you doing"" look that I sometimes get from my family. After I explained it, I think she liked it. So who knows, maybe I was able to provide a trail name for her today.Today's hike was relatively easy. But it was 11.5 miles which is a good day's hike at this point. Papa Monkey built my first AT camp fire tonight. Subman and Suds are nearby. Beth, a thru-hiker I met at the top of Blood Mountain is here too along with a guy I haven't met yet.I just heard that Spirit of 76 is challenged by a sore knee. But she' just one day back.AT friends are great. Thanks for making this a special day. And it's only the 4th day on the trail.","Neel Gap

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521527,"Close friends and family have embraced my ""Rabbit"" trail name. My best friend growing up responded to it with a playful reminder of his particular enjoyment of coming from behind me and tweaking my big ears. I retrieved his message around 2:00 in the morning, laughed, rolled over, and went back to sleep. My response to him involves a new basketball pass I showed him back in 8th grade. I put him down with an unintentional direct shot where the sun doesn't shine. He was so ticked off that he chased me a long way - guess he's still chasing me now. That's what friends are for.AT friends? As you know, I am new to this and am trying to learn quickly. Subman's tent next door began rustling sometime after 5:00 a.m. It's my first Saturday on the trail and I guess we don't sleep in. We had our packs on and began to hike in the dark shortly after 6:00 a.m. It was fun. I thanked Suds for wearing reflectors on the back of her hiking shoes as they were my beacon. Memory of this includes obtaining water from ice melting in a constant flow as the thick ice clung to the rock wall next to the trail. Hiking as the morning light introduces the new day was special too.This morning's trail was easy; filled with numerous opportunities to camp alone (just make sure you bring water to those camping spots). The climb to Blue Mountain Shelter made us work and there was moisture in the air in addition to the good sweat we worked up. We caught up with Papa Monkey at the shelter. Apparently nobody sleeps in on Saturday. It was something after 10:00 a.m. and we'd hiked 7.3 miles. The weather was ornery, clearly the worst so far. I put on my packa (a rain/wind coat that covers me and my backpack in one piece of fabric) and donned a hat with a brim to keep rain off of my glasses. I told Suds that I knew I didn't look good. As I left the shelter, I noticed that day hikers were out hiking as they could easily be differentiated by what they weren't carrying on their backs. They were helpful. As I was sweating under these additional clothes, I noticed that they were dressed for a nice hike outdoors. So I realized the weather wasn't to be the ugliness envisioned at the shelter.Today's hike beyond Blue Mountain goes markedly down to a gap and then takes you right back up. Think of it as an extended escalator ride between floors at a mall and you can't decide whether you want the top or the lower level. Remember that you are carrying 30 pounds on your back and that you are working as hard to climb up as you are to avoid falling as you pick your way through the moist-covered rocks, roots, and muddy trail on the way down.Unicoi Gap was the base of the initial descent. A man calls me over asking if I'd like a soda, water, or something to eat. I tell him I'd love a drink. Wait a minute - I know this guy. Trail Chef was back! He'd driven 1.5 hours this time to again surprise Subman and Suds with trail magic. This guy is a special friend. I was still there with Papa Monkey as yells were exchanged with the surprised hiking duo. A shout out to Chin Music, who successfully thru-hiked in 2013, the cold root beer never tasted so good.I left this happy gathering to begin the next escalator ride. The ride got longer as the day went on. I got to Tray Mountain Shelter a few minutes after 3:00. Loon, another successful thru-hiker from a prior year, had raved about the views from this tenting area. Clearly the views would be awesome here - but not today. Today there is a mist in the air that is blocking the scenery. I get an occasional tease of light breaking through to show the valley in the distance but it disappeared as quickly as it briefly revealed itself.I met Tripper and Slipper today. They are a friendly couple from Jasper ( Georgia) who consciously began their thru-hike the day before Storm Olympia arrived on Monday. There are smiles on their faces as they talk about experiencing it; you have to admire their spunk.The weather is turning for the worse. I change into dry clothes but can't get dry the sweat-soaked clothes worn earlier in the day. I think I'm about to be given another AT learning session tomorrow. Can't wait.","Low Gap

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521632,"Last night did not go well. Despite being on top of a mountain where Verizon coverage is usually good, internet access was inconsistent. Numerous efforts to contact Beth had failed. Fortunately, contact with Subman revealed that Suds and he were camped at Steeltrap Gap, 1.7 miles north of Tray Mountain. I was able to get a weather update for my specific location via atweather.org. Rain was forecast with a possible thunderstorm mid-morning. Nothing else to do but sleep so I tried to sleep.I woke up shortly before 4:00 a.m. to a soaked down sleeping bag and all my gear was wet too. My tent, an Echo 1 Shelter System, was still above me so I was happy about that. What happened? It didn't matter. It was relatively warm outside so hypothermia wasn't a concern. That possible thunderstorm was troubling. Nothing to do but deal with this; so my day began.I was careful to not let the mountaintop's wind blow away any of my wet gear over the cliff that began 20 yards beyond my location - at least I had remembered the stories about others who learned the lesson the hard way about wind gusts separating gear from its owners. Now I had to quietly get my food bag that was hanging from a cable near the shelter. I didn't want to wake up Tripper & Slipper or the Dad and his son who were nearby. Really? My foodbag's cable is stuck with my foodbag a mere few inches above my grasp. Left hand pulling the cable released from its tree anchor, right hand on the suspended food bag trying to separate it from the cable's hook, stretching my toes to get as high as I can. Okay, that wasn't good. No, I was smart enough to not lose my finger as the cable took my foodbag out of my grasp, but what just happened to my finger? Doesn't that look like I dislocated my ring finger somehow? Okay, my finger looks straight again and it doesn't hurt. Try again. Got it. Wow, I don't think I woke up anyone.Was feeling good as I left theTray Mountain Shelter area but it really is dark. Guess there won't be any moonlight tonight to augment my headlamp. The rocks are wet, making the descent down the trail a bit harder than normal. Wish there was a dirt path instead of these rocks. In the darkness it seems that the path could lead here or over there. Slowly picking my way I came to my first white blaze. The AT uses white blazes painted on trees or rocks to identify its path. Good, another blaze - go slow and maybe I can do this. The trail becomes a dirt path and that is very helpful. Hikers are asked to stay within the trail, despite its state of difficult tread, in order to not expand the width of the trail. The washes, created by trail maintainers to remove runoff from the trail, slow me down but I am able to pretty comfortably see the trail ahead. White blazes can be near or far - there is no standard length between them. Good to see that fallen tree separated up ahead - that is a clear sign of the trail maintainers' hard work. I am still on the trail. Stop. Where did it go? It's got to be here. Do I go back? Probably not the best idea since I now find myself uncertain if I've lost the trail. Okay, that was a test. Branches had fallen across the trail, probably in last night's weather up here. 6 or was that the 7th white blaze? No matter - I think I am off the mountainous tread for good now. Lights ahead. ""Is that you Rabbit?"" YES!!! Good morning Suds. Subman is heating water for coffee off trail. They'd had a good night in a nice spot - stayed dry and had surprisingly good internet access. We talked about the coming rain with Subman pretty sure we were going to get wet. I wanted to avoid the thunderstorm, particularly when climbing Kelly Knob and its 4,126 elevation, so off I went. It was still dark, but my confidence had grown. I made it this far night hiking by myself. Good thing it started to get light because my headlamp was noticeably fading to display less of the trail. What was Dad's homily? ""Where there is darkness, give us light. Where there is ignorance, give us knowledge. And for those of us who think we have the truth, give us humility. The need for my headlamp was gone. My left hand kind of bothers me, but it's no big deal. Moving pretty good now. The sky looks much better than expected. Maybe I can beat the storm. Another location noted in AWOL's AT Guide, Kelly Knob is just a few miles away.This must be it. Kelly Knob climbs 800 feet in a mile. Subman had told me that it just goes on and on - and he was right. Just keep moving up. I met Two Peas - nice people from Florida. I mentioned that Subman, Suds, and I were probably going to eat at Daniels All You Can Eat restaurant tonight and invited them to join us if they'd like. No rain or even a sign of it yet - just maybe I can stay dry. I am relieved to be past Kelly Knob. Not much more than 4 miles to go.I pass a Boy Scout troop who are section hiking Georgia. Dicks Creek Gap is here; I can hear the cars.I take a break in the parking lot that is filled. One car pulls in. A family of four is doing a hike today. He offers me various kinds of food but I decline them because I will be eating in town shortly. Yogiing is the art of separating people from their food that a hiker covets - remember the Yogi cartoon bear that always wanted food? The couple are asking non-stop questions about my intended thru-hike. The husband and father clearly intends to thru-hike after his children get through college. The more he talks it makes me think he'd like to begin soon. The boy scout leader passes by, but stops and gives me a bag containing energy bars that he said he doesn't need. Maybe I will be good at Yogiing. I haven't even tried and strangers passing by are giving me food. The couple moves on, but then he comes back saying he's decided to carry his pack today as he takes it out of his trunk. I really think if we'd talked any more that his wife would have to talk him out of starting his thru-hike today.Moving on to what I thought would be the big personal challenge today - hitchhiking. The 5th car to pass stops to pick me up. He is a nice 83 year old man who wishes he'd hiked when he could. He thinks he could've hiked two years ago, but didn't. He drives me to the hotel that has my resupply box. Before checking in, I confirm that the box is there because the lobby doesn't look familiar. It's only been a week since I was here but it has been an eventful week.Talk with Beth to let her know that I safely arrived. I had called her after daybreak as I wanted to give her an update that she could share with Peter. Peter is an ex-Marine that I see at LA Fitness on the weekends. Peter had given me a retirement gift one month ago consisting of a nice card, a gift card, and most importantly - his full name, address, and phone number. Over the last couple years, Beth and I worried if we didn't see him at the gym. We only knew him there and he keeps to himself a lot. It was a major breakthrough obtaining info to be able to contact him directly. Before Christmas, he was hospitalized for almost 3 weeks and we knew something had happened and had wondered whether we'd ever know. Beth said she hadn't seen him yesterday but had printed out these journal pages so that he could catch up on my activities. Can't wait to have some time with him after this hike is over.My hotel room looks like a hurricane hit it. Tent, sleeping bag, footprint - they are all strewn about to get them dry and clean. Wet clothes are pulled out of the bag as laundry is the next agenda item - even before eating. Subman confirms plans to eat at Daniels at 5:00.Subman is pretty far along with ideas on what to do in the coming days. I show him my finger - it is now getting worse and worse with the bruising turning uglier, more swollen, and now the awareness that I have no chance of slipping my wedding ring off. Subman says it's settled as he sees my finger. Suds apparently has some bad blisters that can use rest and recovery instead of possibly getting worse in the coming days of rain. The offer is extended for me to go home with them to sit out the weather while Suds' blisters heal and I can get medical attention for my finger. We'll talk further after getting info and input from Papa Monkey and Two Peas, who Subman also invited to Daniels tonight. Dinner is great and enough is eaten by each of us to put us over the comfort line. Two Peas arrive just as we were leaving so we sit back down to share the plan to wait out the storm. Peas are going to continue to hike saying that they have the gear for the weather. Subman and Suds depart but I stay to get to know Two Peas better. Real nice people who I hope we'll see again up the trail. Papa Monkey is also going to continue to hike. Subman and Suds return. Change in plans. Trail Chef is picking us up in the morning and has invited all of us to do what we need to do from his place.What a day. I hiked 11 miles, some at night in less than desirable conditions. Now kindnesses beyond my thinking are upon me by these wonderful people. I feel like I've experienced, confronted, and hopefully learned a lot today. My dad's homily repeatedly streams through my head. I am grateful for all of it.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521657,"The swelling and ugliness of my finger continued during the night. Should've gotten help earlier. Walked to Chatuge Regional Hospital in Hiawassee after 1:30 a.m.. Dr. Brent Davidson said my wedding ring was becoming a tourniquet and needed to come off. The box of tools used to remove my wedding ring reminded me of the scene in Braveheart when Mel Gibson's character is being tortured via disbowelment. The good news was that the finger's capillaries seemed to be properly circulating blood so only my wedding ring needed to come off. Dr. Davidson told me that Chatuge Regional Hospital is the first hospital along the AT. Dr. Davidson has lots of AT stories and he shared them with me. My favorites involve a European hiker who was carrying an 80 pound backpack and about a young man who came in with one problem only to have to leave the AT because he fidgeted with his knife while awaiting his initial medical treatment and ended up cutting himself to the extent that his self-inflicted injury was worse than his original injury. Let's hope this is my only visit.Trail Chef picked up Subman, Suds, and me to take us to his home in Franklin, North Carolina. Trail talk is easy and endless on the way. These friends genuinely care for each other. I am lucky to be with them. Dinner is delicious. Trail Chef's wife, Judy, comes home from a busy day. She is also a bundle of energy and good spirit. For my LaGrange friends - think of these two as a combination of the Downtons and the Bobysuds - yes, I am that lucky. Suds is soaking her feet. I am icing my finger and my hand. Subman is checking the weather and plotting our return. Trail Chef and Judy are treating us like family. Papa Monkey kept on hiking, got wet, but intends to go out again tomorrow. Spirit of 76 is believed to be out there somewhere and I am trying to get in touch with her because Trail Chef is talking about how many more beds are available for hikers needing shelter. Trail family is a term I've read about - now, I'm living it. Thanks to all who have signed my trailjournal. Your good wishes and encouragement mean a lot.","Dicks Creek Gap

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521707,"Subman, Suds, and I are at Trail Chef's beautiful home where we continue to mend and monitor Storm Petros. It seems we are becoming ""Storm Sitters"" instead of ""Storm Chasers"". This adventure is more of a marathon than a sprint, with millions of steps totaling the equivalent of 26 Mount Everest climbs, so I am very grateful for this safe haven. Trail Chef does his Travis McGee magic (fun detective series of books by John MacDonald) and creates a delicious breakfast combining various ingredients from his abundantly stocked kitchen. I have been a notorious picky eater but I will eat anything he prepares without hesitation.Trail Chef and Judy proudly show us Franklin's impressive library. Like the AT, the people add so much and we are openly embraced and welcomed. Subman identifies Kountry Kitchen as a desired lunch stop and he was so right. A burger here shouldn't be missed if you are in town.  Outdoor 76 is well-known within AT thru-hiker commentaries as having phenomenal abilities to solve foot issues. I started with hiking boots that felt comfortable during my miles of training in park-like conditions but I feel, after these first 70 miles, that their skills can be of value. I hear Judy and Trail Chef ask Rob to take care of me and he does. Outdoor 76 is unlike most stores in that there is an extended conversation about what issues have brought you here and their approach to be responsive to your specific pursuit. If retail proprietors brought this same experience then I don't think internet sales would have replaced so many brick and mortar stores. I leave very happy with my New Balance Endurance trail runners feeling very confident about what I'll be wearing. I notice that Suds purchased a pair of Crocs to change into after each day's hike and that Trail Chef made a purchase too. Subman came out with a slightly used personal favorite pair of hiking boots that are no longer being made. I witnessed the exchange between Outdoor 76's Rob and Subman and can't decide whether it was Rob's beyond generous offer and care about his clients or Subman's skilled yogi abilities. What I saw in this transaction was Subman walking out happy with another pair of his favorite hiking boots and he did it without paying a dime. Subman now has 3 pairs of these boots and thinks they'll get him to the AT's northern terminus of Mt. Katahdin in Maine. Thru-hikers routinely go through 3 - 4 pairs while hiking the AT. Back ""home"", we each take time to further relax and do what we want. For me, catching up with Beth was the highlight. We honestly share that it seems like we've been away much longer than it has been. It is heartening to hear that she thinks she has now gotten into a rhythm with me not being there and she openly states the challenge of being separated. I easily relate to this and admit that a tear is forming as I write this now. I miss her. Despite all the wonderful encounters each day brings the reality is that being separated is very hard.I rejoin Subman and Suds and soon smell the aroma of Trail Chef's next treasured meal. A joke is made about the portion Subman initially takes. I thank Subman for taking so much because it opened the door for me to take a similar amount. Better yet, I took almost as much in a second helping as Judy smilingly said that it should be eaten until it is gone. During this hike, thru-hikers often fantasize and talk of upcoming desired meals. I look forward to remembering this one because what I ate wasn't spaghetti. It may have looked like spaghetti but it was so much more than that. Conversation between us flowed and I am sure that happens routinely around this kitchen table. As dinner progressed I became aware that I was enjoying another great AT moment even though I was miles off the trail. Trail Chef freely talks in a quiet, soft-spoken manner. He and Judy are fascinating people. My fascination led to an inquiry about his varied life and I honestly say that I wish I had a recording of what ensued. Harry Chapin and James Taylor are my all-time favorite musicians with me loving the stories, characters, and tunes that they create. I think Harry would be the one to put Trail Chef's story to music as it moved from one chapter to the next with so many funny and remarkable stories artfully woven together. In the end, I literally begged Trail Chef to get his storylines on some form of media so that it can be shared with his children and their children. I'd love to be given a copy myself but realize that such a request may be asking too much. I know that I am grateful to have heard it tonight. This story begins with a phlebotomist - Suds and Judy share their related stories too. Within this story are tales of the 400 and 700 pound challenges. It moves to an extensive career in the VA with many turns that each have delightful specific story lines of intrigue and Trail Chef's transition from one responsible position to the next. I don't now recall how he became the personal chef to the Governor of Alabama and to creating meals in two-week increments for stars that include Danny DeVito, Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, and other notables. I just know that I was mesmerized by the story of the little boy that threw up all over Trail Chef and how Trail Chef cleaned the boy up and sent him to his mother who was showering upstairs. We all had our mouths drop as we heard of an unnamed actor's wife who greeted Trail Chef at the door in a see-through negligee and continued to speak with him until Trail Chef had to embarrassingly ask this beautiful woman to put other clothing on. There was story of the Hyundai CEO who thanked him for the Korean meal Trail Chef concocted while never having previously prepared a Korean meal. The story of the Alabama governor who called Trail Chef out from the kitchen to have him whisper into his ear how he should eat the prawns that were on his plate - and the side story of the serving staff that seemingly had to be talked to in order to get them to serve the prawns so that the serving plate was presented with the delicacy looking at the diners. This story of a life is a treasure and I repeat my request that this story be written and that your stories be written, if anyone is still reading. Southbounders was identified at the Franklin library by Subman and Suds as being their favorite AT movie. I never heard of it before. It is a terrific telling of the AT trail as experienced by college-age female southbounder. The subtelties in the movie are extensive and I feel that my enjoyment of this movie was greatly enhanced as Subman and Trail Chef pointed out this and that. Subman said he thinks he has watched it thrirty times and I wonder how many times I'll watch it. Spirit of 76 sent a message while we were watching a second movie. Spirit is okay but is probably visiting the same Doctor who treated me. Spirit has caught us so it seems likely fhat we'll chat tomorrow about our intentions to hike out of Dick's Creek Gap on Thursday. A neat aside is that one of Spirit's friends had contacted me through this journal and I was able to provide her info that Spirit is okay.  I didn't hike today. It has been raining very hard outside while this has been written in the early morning hours. I can't wait to get back out hiking again but find myself so grateful for having so many memories that I'll be able to have of this day.","Trail Chef's House

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521935,"Mid-morning it was it decided to get back to the AT. Trail Chef dropped us off at Dick's Creek Gap so that we can resume our hike exactly where we were when we left the AT. Papa Monkey was picked up on our way and it was great to briefly catch-up with him. Papa Monkey endured some tough weather during the days that we were at Trail Chef's house and you can read about Papa Monkey on his trailjournals blog. With such a late start, there was minimal hiking today. In AT vernacular, this is known as a ""Nero"" that means near zero. A ""Zero"" is a single no-hiking day and two consecutive no-hiking days are called a ""Robert Parrish"" - in honor of the great Boston Celtic center who wore that number. I wish I could take credit for creating that ""Robert Parrish"" term but it was created by Gangsta and Wags in 2009. Plumorchard Gap Shelter is a relatively new shelter and has 3 sleeping areas. This night Subman and Suds took the first level, Tyler and James took the second, and I had the loft to myself. Tyler and James are each starting college next year. These two young men are easy to speak with and seem to be strong hikers too. Internet access isn't available at each shelter and inadequate access existed with my Verizon coverage so this post is a bit delayed. I am grateful for these shelters that provide protection from the weather and enable social time with other hikers. Shelters frequently have a privy and a source for water nearby. Specific areas to tent, a safe campfire area, and a table are also often found at a shelter location. The wind is gusting mightily and snow is in the forecast but we are more than comfortable tonight.","Trail Chef's House
",Plumorchard Gap Shelter,"Feb 24, Wed",4.50
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521936,"The wind gusts were strong during the night. An inch of snow fell but it was a manageable cold as we headed out. Tyler noticed that Subman and I were hiking in shorts in this thirty-degreeish weather. Shorts are able to be worn because of the heat generated while hiking. It quickly gets cold as soon as a short break is taken but I'm otherwise comfortable and the shorts help me regulate my body which is important to not be sweaty with no assurance of being able to get dry. Wet clothing combined with cold temperatures can result in hypothermia that can cause death if not recognized and overcome. The first highlight today was the Georgia / North Carolina border. Yes, I've made it; one state down! My understanding is that approximately 25% of those who start a thru-hike don't make it out of Georgia so I am happy to have gotten this far. Out here the little things like this mean a lot. So ""Thank you Georgia"" the weather was so much nicer than I ever could've expected and the trail was easy to follow. But that was the end of the nice weather. Literally just a few hundred feet into North Carolina the weather changed to blustery winds and sleet. Subman and I were definitely not comfortable. The picture at the gnarly oak was taken quickly to minimize how uncomfortable we were. Recent rain created numerous puddles of ice-cold slush and mud. Guess it was inevitable that I stepped in those puddles and I had to keep hiking to air-dry my soaked socks and trailrunners. My lunch break was fast because of the cold and my decision to not change into warmer clothing. Hikers routinely change clothing during the day but it takes time and I chose to hike on today. Standing Indian Shelter, our destination for today, was crowded. The ""Two Peas"" from Florida are here as are Tyler and 3 hikers I've never met before. These 3 hikers decide to hike to the next shelter after they hear how many more hikers are likely coming to this shelter tonight. Whereas the Plumorchard Gap Shelter has a stated capacity for 16 hikers, Standing Indian Shelter is listed as being able to shelter 8. Two Peas had their tent up inside the shelter as they were trying to get warm to overcome the drenching rain of the previous day. A tent typically is 4-5 degrees warmer than a three-sided shelter like the Standing Indian Shelter. We all understood the reason for Two Peas having their tent up but it made for tight sleeping for the six of us inside the shelter and there was no room for James and another hiker who arrived after 5:00 when all of us had already burrowed in for the night. Tonight it is supposed to get down to 19 degrees with winds of 15 miles per hour being the norm and gusts up to 40 miles per hour.  Georgia shelters have bear cables that are provided to suspend each hiker's food bag out of reach of bears. It is important to prevent bears from thinking the shelters are their fast-food locations. This shelter doesn't have bear cables so each hiker has to determine how to protect their food from bears and shelter mice. I decided to ""hang a bear bag"" which means that I toss parachord over a tree limb. The parachord has a little bag attached to it that is filled with rocks or something that provides weight to enable it to be slung over the tree limb. Hikers often laugh at each other's attempts to toss these bear bag lines. Given the cold, nobody is out watching me but I'm pleased to have found a suitable tree nearby and manage to get a successful toss on my fifth attempt. Once the line is set over the limb, a carabiner is affixed to the little bag and the hiker's moisture-proof food bag is attached to the line and pulled up to hang10 feet off the ground and 10 feet away from the tree trunk. Distances less than those can be overcome by a bear's reach or their climbing up the tree. A knot around the tree is used to keep the bear bag line hung and I walked away hoping I'd properly hung my food bag. I haven't seen any signs of bears since mistaking a dog's footprint for a bear cub's footprint. Earlier today I asked Subman and Suds about a footprint I'd seen after a prolonged puddle area. They hadn't noticed it and I later realized it was nothing more than the remnant of a partially filled-in hiker pole. I'm too embarrassed to reveal this latest example of my foolishness so they'll have to read this to get a laugh on me on this one. Internet access wasn't available in this shelter either but as I wrote this journal underneath my sleeping bag a field mouse slithered under my arm probably searching for something of interest among the varied containers and gear we have around us in our attempts to not have these items freeze overnight.  Freezing cold, sleeping tightly next to other hikers, and field mice - living large on the AT. I'm happy to be here, just let my 0-degree sleeping bag keep me adequately warm to get some sleep tonight.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Feb 25, Thu",12.20
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521975,"The morning wake-up was early because it was around 20 degrees. Everyone in the shelter was ready to hike and put this challenging night behind us. First transition was into hiking pants from my wool long johns and wind pants to the underwear and convertible pants that were worn yesterday. I slept on top of both in addition to sleeping on top of yesterday's socks so that my body's heat would dry them out. I was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty dry. Next was to put on my hiking shoes. Fortunately, I had remembered last night to expand the laces to make it easier to put on my hiking shoes. Unfortunately, my hiking boots were frozen solid. I began wedging my warm foot into each shoe. Little by little my feet were pushed in and 15 minutes later I was standing upright. Shirts and clothing to be worn above my waist were already on as part of the layered effort to try to stay warm during the night. My thinsulate gloves were on the wet side but my fingers were functionally working. My seat in the privy was surprisingly warm - I know that's kind of gross but it was my first sensation of warmth since around noon yesterday. Washing my hands was a real ice water experience that lasted too long for my liking. Went out to find my bear bag and was happy to see it hanging where I'd left it. The loud thud I'd heard in the middle of the night turned out to be Tyler hitting his head in the shelter. I thought the gusting winds had brought my food bag to the ground but that wasn't the case. After unwrapping my parachord line from the tree's trunk I yanked the line to have my bear bag descend. Nothing moved. My mind raced as I thought what would need to be done if my bear bag line had frozen to the tree limb. Then it raced to the ribbing I'd take by my shelter's companions. Fortunately this ""oh not again"" moment ended and I quickly retreated to the ""warmth"" of the shelters where everyone was up and about trying to do what they could to get going since standing there idly just led to being cold after emerging from the down sleeping bags or quilts that helped us survive the night. A number of us, me included, have learned that our sleeping bag's temperature rating means the temperature to keep you alive, not the temperature to keep you comfortable. I use a 0 degree quilt and I needed that temperature rating last night. The hike up Standing Indian Mountain went quickly. I scurried up the blue blaze trail to catch views from the summit but found a pervasive mist last seen at Tray Mountain. Snow on the trail was 2 - 3 inches deep but the summit had drifts of 8-10 inches that resulted in some refreshed hing sensations well above my ankles. Then it became delightful. There is almost a 6 mile descent from Standing Indian Mountain to Coleman Gap. There were no roots or rocks to pick my way through because the snow seemed to smooth them. All I could think of was the scene in which Frosty the Snowman glides up and down hillsides. This was fast and easy hiking. Yesterday's puddles of ice-cold slush and mud were frozen and easy to slide across.Subman described Albert Mountain's ascent as being technical. My notes from Chin Music's 2013 hike indicated this was hard and steep. Both were right. The 1.7 mile ascent had some flat moments but it was pretty much up in a hard, but manageable, way until Mooney Gap. Mooney Gap is three-tenths of a mile to the summit and it had multiple moments of rock climbing and pulling yourself carefully up. With my fear of ledges, I was pleasantly surprised to not find anything in this climb to cause me concern. The views near the top and at the top were spectacular. Subman has hiked this a half dozen times and said he's never had such views. I climbed the 4-story weather tower that provided 360 degree views, but the tower itself was locked. I know I am behind on loading photos but I'll try to get them loaded tonight. I think they'll be worth a look as I know my mouth was wide open as I took in the views. Some say your mind is your most important piece of gear as you hike. This piece of gear really let me down when I unintentionally hiked past Subman and Suds as they took a break at Carter Gap. Fortunately this gear rebounded and I remembered that Trail Chef was monitoring Subman and Suds via their Spot device, a GPS tracking device, that indicates where the owner is located. Trail Chef answered my call and told me that Subman and Suds were climbing Albert Mountain so I waited at the top to discuss our end of day options. It was something past 3:00 so we had 3 hours of daylight. A shelter was nearby and a pick up spot Trail Chef could meet us at was 6 miles ahead. Most of the trail was a descent except for one climb. Having already hiked 13 miles today, and we'd already hiked enough mileage to call it a day - but tonight's temperature was to be in the low 20's and we'd just done that last night. Suds was the decider and she opted for the warmth of Trail Chef's home so off we went racing the sun.We passed Rock Gap Shelter around 6:30 and near the end of this day's hike. Trail Chef had told me what happened there last night but seeing it myself was eye-opening. Just as three hikers in the shelter finished eating and burrowed in sleeping bags for the night, a very large tree fell and demolished the patio structure they had vacated just a few minutes ago. Happily, these hikers were all safe. Can you imagine their story?Trail Chef picked us up as the sun went down. After a quick shower, we had one of Trail Chef's scrumptious dinners and Judy hadn't left yet to visit her daughter and granddaughter so we enjoyed her company too.The summit of Albert Mountain is AT mile 100.1. Pretty happy to have reached that milestone. Now I want to repeat those miles and these experiences with these wonderful AT hikers almost another 21 times.","Standing Indian Shelter

A time to update trailjournals with entries and photos. Finally got time to respond to a number of great people who signed in my journal page with info and best wishes. A trip to tweak gear.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522086,"It's crisp this morning at our 8:06 start. Then the sun's warmth is felt with a ""welcome back"" reminder. This adventure is still at the beginning but the spring's happy gurgle makes one feel so comfortable with a gentle message of ""take it all in, that's why you're here.""Subman and Suds were ahead of me as I came to Wallace Gap. A new hiker, Going Postal, was there. He said he'd spent the night at Long Branch Shelter and that the shelter was packed. When I asked who was there he rattled off familiar names. I stopped, turned, and headed south on my northbound trek. If you're keeping track, this doesn't count as going the wrong way. My thinking was what is a mile or so in order to see Spirit of 76, Colin, Zack & Angela. I went back to the Rock Gap Shelter and took more photos of what happened. Those hikers really are lucky to be alive. In the photos, look at size of the limbs that fell just to the left of them. Ten feet to the right and it really could've been bad. Soon the entourage started to appear. Spirit didn't recognize my voice but I saw a big smile when she realized it was me. We hiked a few miles together to Winding Stair Gap. Trail Chef had asked me to contact Spirit about staying at his home. I left the three of them in a parking lot and began hiking solo since they are headed in to Franklin for a day or two. Tonight Trail Chef messaged to say that Spirit of 76, Zack, and Angela are at Trail Chef's home. I am sure they will all enjoy each other's company. The AT has a way of bringing people together and today was one of those chance meetings.Day hikers were out today. As Subman said - today was a perfect 10 for hiking - sunny and a comfortable cool that let you hike without getting sweaty. Siler Bald was the attraction today. It exceeded expectations. The views from the summit were awesome and available in every direction. One of the men pointed out Clingmans Dome that is 85 miles away.   Hard to believe that I'll soon be there. The two couples at the top were fascinated with my thru-hike plan and asked a number of questions. Quite different from yesterday's question at Walmart when the cashier asked me if I was okay. Guess I'm looking scruffy now since I haven't shaved since starting the hike. Different experiences. One thinking I'm possibly in need of help and the other inquisitive about this appealing adventure.After the summit, my thoughts returned to a question posed to me via this journal's sign-in page. What is tougher - the mental or the physical aspect of this hike? Right now - for me - the mental part is harder. The physical has its moments but they are just moments and I've intentionally avoided some bad weather that might result in the need to change my answer if I had hiked every day in that bad weather. The mental challenge is the fear of the unknown. Will I have enough time to get comfortable before nightfall? Where was last white blaze - did I miss it, and am I lost, or will there be some sign that assures me I am still on the trail? Tray Mountain's descent, by myself, in darkness, with whatever dislocation existed in my hand was my scariest moment to date. As each day passes, I am feeling more comfortable here in non-threatening weather. I wish I could confidently say that I am capable of being here without the assistance I've gotten from Subman and Trail Chef. I can't kid myself. I've needed the off trail breaks to adjust and reset myself for the next days out on the trail. The banter between them and their stating that the hiking ahead is similar to the hiking behind is helpful. Don't misinterpret these statements to think that I'm a bundle of nerves out here because I'm not. There's a spring in my step and I wake up every day genuinely thrilled about what is coming my way around the next corner. I can't do without my AWOL trail guide that provides incredible detailed info in the form of landmarks and upcoming or past locations for water, shelter, a privy or a ride into town. Hiker Hostel owner Josh said it best - ""You're not going to die on the AT. You're going to suffer - a lot, but you're not going to die."" Strange as it may seem but that's a comforting perspective as each mile passes. I also can't do without this cell phone and that's annoying to me. But I want my cell phone and access to call Beth, post these journals, hear from all of you, and be able to check the weather. I do respectfully fear the weather. Spirit of 76 told me today of her challenging ordeal when she was confronted without notice by hail and lightning en route to Tray Mountain Shelter. That terrain is hard. Those conditions could shake one's confidence and chase you off the AT. She is smiling and thrilled to be here. ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."" Sayings like that feel real and aren't just sayings right now.Hope that helps a bit. Realize it was a lot of rambling. This is just the start. I'm a newbie finding my way. It will be interesting to see how this thinking evolves as hundreds of miles are hiked instead of just the first hundred miles.One last observation from today. Okay two. Continually thinking about everything as you hike expands awareness of everything. There is no mind numbing TV, even though I enjoy watching TV for countless hours at home. If I want a snack right now I'd have to get out of this tent, confront the cold, pull down the bear bag line,.... Am sure you get it, it's not easy. Best I can do right now is get a drink of water and I can't drink that much because I came in tonight with just a couple liters. And I am remembering tonight to keep my water close to my body. I don't want a frozen water bottle that is worthless for hours until it thaws.My shadow. I mean really. Am I losing my mind and reverting to being a child? All day long as the sun shined it felt like I was becoming Peter Pan. My ""Tinkerbell"" shadow was darting to my left and right all day. I've never been more aware of my shadow than today. Today I was in control. Want to go backward to see friends - do it. Want to fall behind those lifeline connections that you've been hiking with and hope you'll be able to catch up with - do it. Be grateful that no matter how far away you physically are from those you love and others you've just met or haven't met yet - but feel so connected to in this adventure - Believe it. Because out here it feels that way and it feels great.","Rock Gap

Yes, he's a special guy - my son's best friend and college roommate. And yes, Ricky is a leap-year baby. Our country could not have someone better than Ricky in its service. I've met many veterans through the AT and they are all impressive. Thanks to all who are serving now or have previously served.Today was another near perfect weather day. The views were phenomenal. A couple were what Beth and I refer to as ""Greylock"" views in recognition of our first mouth-dropping experience at Massachsetts' Mt. Greylock when we saw where we had been from a distance and just could not believe that we had hiked from there a relatively short time ago. Today's first such moment came at Wayah Bald Stone Tower when Subman pointed to Siler Bald, where I just hiked from yesterday. Then Suds told me that inside the Tower were two maps that identified numerous peaks that might be visible. Using one map, Albert Mountain and Standing Indian Mountain could be seen. Off in the distance was Clingmans Dome that I hope to hike to next week. Later in the day, Subman identified the Wesser Bald Observation Tower and said we'd be there in about one hour. It is simply amazing. The blue blaze trail to Rocky Bald made me work but the work was more than paid off by that location's views. It seemed that some camp there so give this spot a thought. There were a number of great stealth camping spots during today's hike. Campers in this area shouldn't feel the need to tent only near the shelters. But if you want to shelter - the Cold Spring Shelter is literally right on the AT. This shelter is small but looks so inviting, given its log-cabin construction. There were so many options today that I could easily see spending extra time here in order to optimize the experience.Speaking of taking time. We passed Rookie today. He began his southbound thru-hike on July 13, 2015. He has less than 200 miles to go. He looked so happy as we briefly heard about his journey.The comments on the sign-in page stopped me in my tracks today with me wanting to comment on two of them. Rock Boat - I so appreciate your feedback. I can only hope to successfully come through a rain test like you did. David - your references to ""Hook"" made me laugh out loud and I shared them with my hiking bubble today that consisted of Subman & Suds and Big Cypress & Moonbeam (the really nice couple from Florida who write in trailjournals as ""Two Peas"".Another incredible day. There was little time thinking reflectively because there was so much good discussion on the AT as we leap-frogged, or stopped to take in the sites, or had a break together. Subman has been here many times and said the visibility available today was as good as he's seen it. I was here today. I got to take it in with fellow hikers who made it all the more special.","USFS 69 Meadow

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522236,"Lots of hiking today as Subman, Suds, and I pushed to get to Stecoah Gap, where Trail Chef graciously met us and took us, one more time, to his home. ""Sub Special"" is my name for Subman's optimization plan that enables us to hike for long hours and yet arrange for an evening of comfort well beyond anything that could otherwise be anticipated. This was the 3rd ""Sub Special"" and I hope to have many more.The morning's start from Wesser Bald Shelter couldn't have been better. Out just after 7:30, the hiking was easy in what seemed like a cool Fall morning. Natanhala Outdoor Center is right on the trail. There is a restaurant, an outfitter, and a general store. This area is a hub for outdoor activities, particularly white-water kayaking and rafting. As we walked by a fisherman cast his fly. Subman, Suds, and I had breakfast. The waitress couldn't have been nicer. Most of the other thru-hikers seen in the last day were there. A moment like this makes you feel like a thru-hiker because you realize, as you clean-up to go into the restaurant, that not everyone is doing what you are doing. When out on the AT, it feels like you're just hiking with other hikers. Breakfast was beyond words. Subman's meal came with 3 eggs but then he found an add-on opportunity for an additional 2 eggs and he went for it. My special treat was a very large glass of chocolate milk - I think the waitress was surprised how quickly it disappeared. So a second glass was ordered. Memories of enjoying chocolate milk were exchanged with Suds. Food is becoming a regular topic of conversation. Subman readily acknowledges that his ""hiker hunger"" appetite has kicked in. Suds and I don't have insatiable appetites yet, but we are cleaning our plates thoroughly. It was almost a 6-mile downhill climb before breakfast and yet we are smiling and feeling refreshed as we leave. I've read this section of the AT in so many other trailjournal entries that I knew what was coming next - an almost 6 mile section to gain almost 3,000 feet. This is not a walk in the park. Subman and Suds started out as I was taking pictures. Once ready to get underway, I laughed as I walked in one direction after another trying to find the AT again - a humbling moment for sure. The start is steep and the long climb ahead quickly becomes a reality. I moved ahead and hiked solo for a couple hours. Today is March 1st, known to be the starting day of the ""bubble"", a day when a disproportionate large number of hikers begin their AT thru-hike from Springer Mountain. I feel fortunate to be where I am, to be hiking with Subman and Suds, to be separated by one day's hiking (more or less) from many hikers who I know and increasingly care about. I am beyond convinced that, despite my intent, I'd have quickly abandoned my thru-hike if I had started my hike today. There's just no way I can see myself successfully navigating through the initial miles comfortably as so many seek shelter in the same area. The sheer number of hikers would've provided an adrenaline rush but I don't know how all those faces would've become meaningful people to me. I hiked today counting my blessings - Trail Chef has been such an important factor. He has enabled my hike, as have Subman and Suds. If months from now I am fortunate enough to have completed this thru-hike then it will be because of the experience and the kindness of these 3 people who have gotten me off to this start.A sprinking rain was refreshing but my stop at what Trail Chef described as ""Niagara Falls"" was memorable. Before I left it, Subman yelled to announce their arrival. Rembering Trail Chef say that he drank straight from this spring, we all savored this water. I drank handful after handful and actually lost sight of Subman and Suds because of lingering there so long.  Today's views weren't as frequent as yesterday but they are special because each ""Jump"" view was shared with Subman and Suds. The first was the Jump-off after the Wesser Bald Shelter. I was a bit concerned based on Subman's description because of my fear of ledges. The turn's decent is a bit tricky and was the first time I used my butt. The second was the ""Jump-up"" and it provided a ""Greylock"" moment of accomplishment when we looked down where we had breakfast and across to the mountain we had climbed. Cheoh Bald seemed to never end and was celebrated with a group high-five. The decision to push on to Stecoah Gap had been made minutes earlier when Trail Chef confirmed he could pick us up. The sprinkles transitioned to rain and we're now chilling instead of comforting. Darkness came before sunset and the AT became treacherous. Rock sequences that are often fun in daylight were anything but that tonight. I had my first fall when my foot pushed through whatever I put it on. Fortunately I fell into dirt instead of rock that certainly would've caused a bruise, if not a break. Nothing to do but get up and get going. The descent wasn't over. I was grateful this day ended and grateful for its ups and downs.","Wesser Bald Shelter

The intent is to avoid multiple cold nights and hopefully set up mostly good weather days for Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Observations from this very limited hiker's experience include:Associate and surround yourself with hikers that you think you'll like to get to know;""Be flexible and take advantages of changing your gear as you realize changes are needed;Carry extra ""batteries because you don't know if you'll start your hiking day before dawn or hike past sunset and neither is a time to lack light;Don't panic when uncertainty creeps in and have confidence that you will find that next white blaze or a sign that you are on the right path;Experienced hikers are incredibly helpful and willing to pass along helpful info;Food drop boxes are helpful but, if you are like me, be prepared to mail home far more than you ever imagined;Keep dry clothing available for use at the end of your hiking day so that you can quickly get warm after you're no longer generating heat as you hike;Laugh at yourself and share that laughter with others as everyone enjoys having fun while overcoming challenges;Outfitters know of options to overcome challenges - just explain the problem as clearly as you can;Place your loaded backpack in a shopping cart and use a hand carrier to be aware of the weight and volume of your purchases that will soon be on your back;Sit down when taking a break and resist the urge to hike non-stop to obtain more miles;Take time to speak with trail angels as they love to relive their hiking days and have stories that will increase your desire to continue so that you can create your own stories;Weather reports like atweather.org are very helpful.News from the AT includes:I'm told that Tyler now goes by the trail name of ""Rusty"" to fulfill his dad's desire to give him that name when he was born - Tyler's last name is ""Pots"" or ""Potts"" so while his mother won out originally his dad finally got ""Rusty Pots"";A couple hikers told me they heard of a hiker who had to get off the AT because of a broken finger - I was happy to tell them that I am still hiking.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522450,"Trail Chef drove us back to Stecoah Gap and we were back on the AT by 8:15. This may be the last time I see Trail Chef so today's goodbye was more meaningful than previous times. Jacob's Ladder greeted us with a substantial climb but our fresh legs and stomachs full of good food enabled us to overcome it in much better shape than I could ever imagine. Our luck with the weather continues as we had sun instead of the forecasted rain. I think we've had sun for some portion of every day that we've hiked. I was feeling good this morning and hiked solo until Subman, Suds, and I were briefly united at Cable Gap Shelter. Whereas Jacob's Ladder wasn't a struggle, I found the climb immediately after Cable Gap Shelter to be a real challenge. The weather and trail also became a challenge in the afternoon. The morning's sun was replaced by varying types of snow - sometimes lightly falling snow flakes, to flurries, to flurries with some wind that made it uncomfortable, and finally to a wet snow that made for slippery conditions on leaves, roots, and rocks. For the first time in daylight I had a difficult time being able to stay on the AT. The wet snow seemed to erase the trail's path. Fortunately this only lasted for a few hundred yards but I did have to go backwards a few yards in order to walk past each of the AT's white blazes. Today's 14 miles seemed easy in comparison to hiking similar mileage in recent days. It's possible that my ""hiker legs"" are starting to develop which would help with some challenging hikes coming in the Smoky Mountains. The picture with today's entry was a real stunner. Beautiful wood seats were found miles from AT access points. Maybe there are ways to easily get here other than the AT because otherwise it would take a decent hike to reach them. I just know I enjoyed them. Another picture included in today's photos was a somewhat magical series of rim-iced trees. I wish I was a better photographer because the white ice clinging to a swath of trees for a mile or more while being surrounded on both sides by trees with no ice was perplexing in a fantasy sort of way. I really didn't care how or why this unique setting existed I just wanted to keep taking it in.","Stecoah Gap

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522531,"Today seemed harder than just 12.6 miles. The sun just couldn't seem to break through except for brief moments. The trail leaving Fontana Dam was dry and provided good footing. Our entrance into Great Smoky Mountain National Park had us believing that the afternoon might find us hiking in a t-shirt. Today's hike had us climb 2800 feet to tonight's 4586 foot elevation. With the higher elevation came changes in the snow. Snow wasn't on the trail, then it appeared, then it became slushy, and then it became crunchy as it got colder with the higher elevation.The visual highlights today came before the Shuckstack Fire Tower and then from the upper steps of the tower. The Shuckstack Fire Tower is .1 mile off the AT. It is identified in AWOL's Guide but isn't marked with a blue blaze like so many other interesting side trips off the AT. I loaded a few pictures from the tower and recommend it if you are hiking here on a clear day. My climb of the tower today was challenging because each step and each of the tower's handrails were coated with a thin layer of ice. But I made it up and down without a mishap and thought the views were well worth the effort.I caught up with Subman and Suds about 1-2 miles before Mollies Ridge Shelter. It was before 3:00 but Suds and I were cold as we had continued to climb in shorts today. Hiking generates so much heat that shorts can be worn comfortably in 30 degree weather. Campers are required to stay in shelters in Great Smoky Mountain National Park because of the park's bear population. There are more bears here than anywhere else in the U.S. except Alaska. As the afternoon continued more hikers arrived. First to arrive were ""The Itailians"", who separately are Papa Wolf and Halmi (Halmi is one of their 15 grandchildren's shortened version of the Korean word for ""grandmother"". He is ex-Army Special Forces. They both seem real nice. Next was Matt Briggs, who I first met at Hiker Hostel before my first day on the AT. Matt is ex-Army too. At the hostel, he explained that he was really in to the blues. He's just accepted the trail name of ""Blues Brother"". Happy to see him again. As the night has gone on more have arrived. I think this 12-person shelter may even be full. We're at Mile 177.3 seemingly way ahead of the bubble.   Tennessee shelters have ""toilet areas"" instead of privies at the shelters so tomorrow morning could be an ""interesting walk in the park"".","Fontana 28 AT Crossing, Fontana Dam, NC

The new experience today was rim-ice showers. Rim ice fell from trees like rain showers. And that became the problem. The firm trail became icy slush again. My trailrunners were soaked with no chance of getting dry. Descents became treacherous so the hiking that moved quickly in the morning slowed in the afternoon. Rocky Top was today's visual highlight. Views in all directions. Must admit that I realize I am spoiled with the recent ability to see 360 degree views on a daily basis.Judy Johnson sent me the following ""What is an AT hiker's favorite day of the year?

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522854,"Today was incredible. Shelter talk last night was lively and the good spirit carried over to this morning. Subman gave us the news that last night's gusty winds brought 1-2 inches of snow. Blues Brother's news was that it was 23 degrees. So Subman told Suds to sleep some more. You have to love it - they were up and out by 7:15. As Subman said ""Hike so you can get warm."" There was a blue sky and it looked promising. Blues Brother was reluctant to commit to going to Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT at 6667 feet. I assured him it would be a balmy, sunny day. He acknowledged that yesterday was his best weather day yet, the first he'd hiked with us, and thought that I may be his good luck rabbit's foot.The snow was powder. The Italians' Papa Wolf asked me at a shelter resting stop whether I was tracking the bobcat or whether it was tracking me. And here I thought I just needed to worry about bears. Subman reported seeing a wolf's tracks. At the end of the day, Papa Wolf reported seeing tracks of boar, bobcat, deer, rabbit, skunk, and turkey. The tracks made interesting diversions as they'd be on the trail and then go off into the woods. The trail itself was easier today with less straight-up climbs in favor of pretty consistent graded climbs. White blazes were less frequent than usual. Papa Wolf, Subman, and I all remarked wondering if we were on the AT. If not, then we knew we'd all be someplace together because it was natural to follow footprints.The banter between the 5 of us at Siler Bald Shelter has been so good that Papa Wolf was already talking about a reunion after we successfully thru-hiked together. I've repeatedly read about AT trail family but experiencing it was new and felt great. Speaking of family, I was relieved to get a message successfully sent to Beth here. Access has been near non-existent inside Great Smoky Mountain National Park.The prize today was clearly Clingmans Dome and it did not disappoint. Subman gave this day a ""12"" on a scale from 1 - 10; the extra points were awarded for there being no cloud over Clingmans Dome and there being no wind. Trust me when I say that the pictures don't do justice to the views. The road to Clingmans Dome is closed now and won't reopen until April 1st so we had the Observatory Tower all to ourselves to take pictures and yell congratulations to each other as each emerged from the trail. The Tower provides peak maps that identify mountains and their distances. It was great to see Standing Indian, Cheoah Bald, and Fontana Dam and to know that we'd already climbed them. Cheers went up as Blues Brother joined us.The sun was out and was warm all day. Unlike yesterday though, we were spared slush for the most part because the trail up to and past Clingmans Dome largely went through evergreens. This is the first such evergreen passage way and it was delightful. I really expected music to start playing because it felt like someone had spent inordinate time and effort to landscape such a beautiful approach. The descent after Clingmans Dome and then the climb to Mt Collins Shelter were as beautiful as the approach. Unlike recent days when the last miles seemed to last forever, this day's hike was tiring but then seemingly all of a sudden it was over.The six of us - Subman & Suds, the Italians (Papa Wolf and Halmi), Blues Brother, and I - were joined by 7 others as the sun set. Our group did 13.5 miles today and that's as much as any of us can handle (except possibly Blues Brother). The other 7 were all extremely fit men, many former military, and they probably hiked close to 20 miles. They'll be far ahead of us in days. It seems all of us are headed to Gatlinburg tomorrow to resupply. Hiker hunger may not have begun yet but there is a lot of discussion about what favorite foods will be immeidately consumed.Today was a special day.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522859,"Just a short hike today because we needed to resupply in Gatlinburg. The 6 of us - Subman & Suds, the Italians (Papa Wolf & Halmi), Blues Brother, and me - all started hiking before 7:00 and were done around 9:00. The plan was to call for a shuttle at Newfound Gap but the shuttle wouldn't arrive until 10:30 and we had all envisioned finishing breakfast by then so it was time to hitch a ride. Subman's initial effort didn't result in a ride because the couple was driving in the opposite direction. So since the couple couldn't provide a ride, they stopped, opened their trunk, and gave Subman a bag full of snacks. Subman has talent! Still needing a ride, Papa'Wolf approached a slow moving camper that had stopped to take in the views at Newfound Gap. Excitement ensued with the news that 4 could jump in. Then a few minutes later came the news that 2 more could be fit in so the 6 of us were all on our way to Gatlinburg together. The fascinating part of this journey were our drivers - Geoff & Annette Wiadrowski from Australia. The Wiadrowskis left Australia 3 months ago to begin their 40,000 mile, 11 month tour of the United States. Funny how it's become roitine for people to ask us about our journey and here we find ourselves talking to a couple who are underway with their own incredible adventure. They were amused by our plans. Annette giggled at the idea of sprouting angel wings when she heard that she and her husband were trail angels since they were providing us trail magic in the form of their driving us 15 miles in to Gatlinburg. The picture today is provided in response to a few requests to show what I look like at this point in the journey. Felt a bit foolish asking if I could have a picture taken with their rabbit decoration but the kind people at NOC Great Outpost said they've had stranger requests. Will admit I never have done such things in the past. You have to wonder what lies ahead.","Mt. Collins Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523036,"The paid shuttle out of Gatlinburg cost $70 but it was being split by 7 of us so it was a pretty good deal to know that our 6:30 departure would have us hiking by 7:00. In the van were Papa Wolf, Halmi, Blues Brother, me, and 3 hikers that will hike so fast and far that we'll never see them again (Nugget, Booty, and Jason - a 2011 successful thru-hiker). Yes, that's correct - Subman and Suds were not hiking today having decided to take a zero to enjoy Gatlinburg. This was a big decision for me - to hike without them. Subman, Suds, and I began our AT thru-hike quest separately on February 16th but we'd hiked together almost immediately thereafter. The two were so much fun to hike with, had easily and comfortably provided so much info to a newbie hiker like me, and we had spent our zero days together with Trail Chef. My trail family was separating today and it was on my mind throughout the day. The phrase ""hike your own hike"" is often repeated on the trail because unless you're a hiking team connected by blood or long-standing relationship, hikers have to make sacrifices to hike with each other. There's a lot to it and more than just each day's pace and mileage to be hiked. If you've read this journal from the start then you know this is a big deal for me. I began wondering if I'd find hiking family like Gangsta had with Wags, Chin Music had with B-Rocket, Lucky had with the Hiking Vikings, Red Panda had with Chris, or Not Yet had with Axon & Shrugs. These rich hiking relationships are an important part of the allure of my AT hike. Not easy to cast off and consciously hike my own hike - even if it was with Papa Wolf, Halmi, and Blues Brother. When I saw that Subman and Suds has signed my trailjournal (on the left), then I knew that they were thinking this was a split too. So, for now, we'll hike separately. As access is available and as it seems to make sense, I'll send scouting reports to them of upcoming trail conditions that they might encounter. Admittedly, I'll do this more for me than for them because they are more than capable of fending for themselves. Will we hike together again? We'll see. My reading of others' trailjournals accounts has me knowing that resupply locations often bring hikers together - even those who haven't seen each other for hundreds of miles. A lot on my mind today as this hike barely began.The hike began with a torturous start. Thick ice blanketed the trail for the first 45 minutes. A group of 3 college-age girls were found giggling about how their lack of traction had led to one of them landing on her butt and unable to stand - except that she was perilously close to finding herself slide off the trail and down the steep ledge beside her. I learned later in the day that these 3 safely returned to the Newfound Gap parking lot. I was straining but moved ahead. The first of many views today seemed to exist off a side trail so I went there and was rewarded with a phenomenal view. There are many pictures today. I complained later in the day that there was no time to hike today because I was constantly powering up my phone, taking pictures, and then powering it down to save my battery. Okay, we ultimately were hiking in the 70's today and the extreme cold was no longer sucking battery out of the phone so the smart thing to do was save time to hike by leaving the phone in ""airplane"" mode. Thanks Blues Brother for that info and laugh - I have so much to learn about so many things out here.After a picture or two, I messaged Subman and Suds to say that after a difficult start the trail became manageable. About 20 minutes later I found myself on my butt as my feet gave out from under me on a flat patch of what I saw as simple, but icy, trail. No injuries as my backpack absorbed the blow. I hiked to the first shelter alone and was happily stunned to find Blues Brother there. He must have passed me as I was on the side trail taking photos. I learned that Papa Wolf and Halmi weren't too far behind, had fallen, but were okay. So Blues and I hiked together talking and taking pictures. If you intend to hike this section, do what you can to try to be here on clear day because the views are incredible and are many.Charles Bunion Knob provides spectacular viewing opportunities and a bit of danger too. The sign - the first such sign I've seen - warned to ""Control Children Closely"". The ledges are not forgiving. My fear of ledges was surprisingly held in check as I shimmied out on to the knob to take more pictures and have Papa Wolf snap one of me sitting atop it. Blues Brother, Papa Wolf, and Halmi were long gone by the time my picture-taking was over. I hiked solo, stopping repeatedly for more pictures, and didn't catch up with them until the next shelter, a place we had discussed as being our stopping location for the day depending on how we felt about hiking more miles today. Along the way came 3 college-age young men hiking in shorts and t-shirts. One wasn't wearing a shirt, revealing that we was ripped. Ah, to be young again. Scratch that, I was (and am) scrawny and never looked like that - end of daydream. The others had decided to hike on to the next shelter, making this a 15 mile day which is no small feat in the Smokies. Now that this decision was made, I knew that the next shelter had a reliable water source and so I asked Blues Brother to take out of my pack a 2-liter Platypus water bag and dump it. When getting in the van earlier this morning I had asked if everyone was aware that there were no reliable water sources for 15 miles. I was carrying enough water for the day and night. One liter of water weighs 2.2 pounds so smart hikers only carry what they need or a little extra to comfortably reach the next reliable source. Blues took the opportunity to take some of the water I lugged up today's mountains. And then he stopped after taking what I viewed as next to nothing. I made a remark about the volume and weight of the water I had carried. We had a good laugh on me as he dumped out and discarded 3 pounds. Then I asked him to go to the other side of my backpack for an additional water bag so that he could dump more weight. The laughter at my foolishness was full. It would be repeated later in the day as Blues enjoyed moments at my expense with other hikers in tonight's shelter. After dumping the load, I remarked as to how much easier if was to hike with my lighter pack. We then commiserated over how my photos had to be taken today and how they broke up my hike because of my powering up and down the phone. More laughter at my expense and the lesson about airplane mode when hiking in warm weather. So we hiked together again until I stopped for another photo. The extra 6-8 pounds of water I had carried for most of the day caught up with me and I consciously slowed my pace so that I was hiking solo again. Tonight's shelter finally arrived. What a difference to set down in a comfortable temperature for the night. We settled in with new people too - a group of Virginia Tech guys here for spring break and a few section hikers we'd not met before. Trail stories ensued as we became familiar with each other. This was a hard, but good, day. A moment ago, a mosquito was attracted to my phone's light (I'm writing this at 2:00 a.m.). Great - bugs - a new problem to confront while we enjoy the nice temperature.","Newfound Gap

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523051,"The new experience today was waking up and realizing that I wasn't freezing. Must admit it was nice. The shelter banter was good and everyone was out early. We left before 7:00 because we planned on hiking out of the Smokies today. Blues Brother was hiking very fast today and took off - he's clearly capable of big mileage days whenever he feels like it. Papa Wolf, Halmi, and I leap-frogged as I stopped to take pictures. The views weren't as spectacular as yesterday but there was a continuous ability to see mountains through thin trees. I caught up with Turkey Tracker, a section hiker who is doing her 3rd section this week. She did a 50 mile section when she turned 50. Did 51 miles the next year and is here doing Great Smoky Mountain National Park this year which is 70+ miles. Nice conversation and I learned that she's hiked some with her 3 sons - maybe her husband too. Low Gap found all of us together and up came a couple of nice older men from a side trail. This resting stop became a longer one as we learned about each other. Hikers genuinely speak with and have interest in each other - this is a really nice aspect of hiking the trail.The ""prize"" today was Mt Cammerer Lookout Tower. It required a .6 mile one-way side trail. Side-trail mileage doesn't ""count"" as miles walked in the total shown with each journal because those miles aren't on the AT. The same goes for miles required to hike to/from a shelter or wherever we sleep for the night. This side trail had climbs and descents so it wasn't the easiest but I recommend it if you're hiking on a clear day. The tower itself was an interesting structure and it provided an external walk around railing area that enabled views in all directions. The inside was pretty big and I suspect that hikers sometimes sleep here whether they are allowed to or not - I know I'd sleep here if I came through this area again.Don't know the reason why but hiking in 70 degree weather left me ready to take a nap - just like I sometimes do at home. No such luck today. There was a lot of downhill climbing today until exiting from the park. Then, after an extended walk next to a creek came a rather steep climb before the walk to Standing Bear Farm. This hostel is run by former thru-hikers and is a really comfortable place, an experience I'd recommend to make you feel part of the AT community. The fire pit was put to good use and provided a great ending to this day as the farm's workers came and went periodically, each with their own interesting story. With just 10% of the AT hiked now, today felt like I was part of all this - what a nice feeling to sleep on.","Tri-Knob Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523154,"Didn't start hiking today until 8:00. That's because today's hike will intentionally end with 13.6 miles when we arrive at Max Patch Summit. My son, David, and I hiked from Standing Bear Farm to Hot Springs in 2015 so today's hike has been one that I'd been looking forward to from the start of this thru-hike.Max Patch was cleared of all trees and bushes for cattle. What this means is that this mountain top is a very large bald (no offense Doug M.) that enables unobstructed views in every direction. It is a special place and I defy anyone who remembers The Sound of Music to be here and not think that Julie Andrews won't come running up the mountain side singing that famous song. So today's hike is more about getting to Max Patch to enjoy the sunset and a sunrise tomorrow morning.To get to Max Patch today required two substantial climbs, reminders that regardless of Clingmans Dome being the highest point on the AT, it is definitely not all downhill from that point on.In addition to the climbs was a blowdown that required the greatest walk around so far. Pictures taken today probably won't be able to be posted as quickly as this journal but I took a photo of this blowdown. I can't imagine how the terrain will withstand the volume of hikers coming through in a week or two as getting around it today was a challenge. Blowdowns were plentiful during the last day's hike in the Smokies. I'm thinking that some of the bigger ones should be named and included in the AT guides if they will not be removed. My nominations for two of yesterday's blowdowns would be ""Castrator"" and ""Son of Castrator"" because one wrong move with either of those two would be more than a little problematic. Renting tonight on Max Patch Summit sure sounded like a good idea this morning. Right now the winds are gusting so mightily that I hope my tent won't be blown down too.Water was a bit scarce today. Water didn't exist in locations identified in AWOL's guide as being reliable. Fortunately water did exist in a stream/creek that was .3 mile before the summit so I got my water there (picture coming). Once on Max Patch Summit this wonderful place's stunning scenery was everything I remembered. People that live nearby really have a special place here. I quickly met and spoke with Wyatt & Darcy, who were here with Flash, as they enjoyed the late afternoon and sunset. They are a nice couple from Asheville. It was fun to speak with them and get a glimpse of a couple enjoying this place. All the best to them. Like so many others you meet in the AT, you can't help but wish that you could follow-up with them in a few years to see how their lives are unfolding. ""Maniac"", a successful 2013 thru-hiker, and ""Runner"", who ended his thru-hike attempt in Massachusetts, stopped by to talk gear and AT. Again, the AT brings you to special places like this where people talk to each other easily instead of just passing by. Then there was the nice couple who brought over a soda and pretzels before leaving; they recognized Blues Brother and me as being thru-hikers and correctly assumed that we weren't carrying such items and would enjoy these treats.The scenery and sunset were good, not the best I've ever seen but certainly worth being here. In the distance was Mt. Cammerer. As Blues said, can you believe we hiked from there a day and a half ago? It really is hard to imagine. Thinking about Mt Cammerer Lookout Tower in a special way tonight because Subman & Suds are sleeping inside there tonight (Don't tell anybody because they know they aren't allowed to do such a thing and jokingly asked if I'd bail them out if they get caught.) I messaged back to tell them where Blues and I are tenting tonight so give us a wave. It's 9:30, a half hour later than an updated forecast indicated when it might rain. So far, so good. There are no bear cables or trees to hang a bear bag so Blues and I are tenting with food inside our tents. Bears like our food. So far, so good. I am here on Max Patch Summit with Blues Brother, very happy to have shared another full and enjoyable day hiking the AT. So far, so good.","Standing Bear Farm

So I am here meaning the tent withstood the gusts during my night on Max Patch Summit.Sunrise on Max Patch Summit was as special as I hoped. I wish I was a better photographer to capture its beauty. Blues Brother and I were the only two on the summit. It was easy to get caught up in this setting as the sunrise slowly evolved. Between pictures and taking it all in was the chore of breaking down the tent and loading up the backpack for today's hike. I was holding very tightly to my tent because it would've gone a long way if the wind had gotten hold of it. Blues Brother was hilarious chasing after his foam seat pad that had gotten away. Another special moment.Blues Brother left Max Patch Summit before I did so I was hiking solo. Whereas there were few water sources yesterday, there were many available today and they provided multiple opportunities to rock hop to avoid getting wet. Quickly stepping across water is fun as you select each rock or branch to place your feet. It was so much fun that I darted across and followed the trail to the left. A good 5 minutes later as the trail became more difficult to navigate over or under fallen trees, it finally dawned on me that I was no longer on the AT. So I backtracked and found a short path, kind of steep, that put me on an infrequently used road. Was feeling good about that until I realized there were no white blazes to found. Backtracked again all the way back to my pleasurable rock hopping location. There it was. A white blaze clearly indicating to turn right instead of left. Twenty minutes of extra hiking is no big deal was my thinking now that I was back on the AT. I wouldn't have been smiling if this had been near nightfall. Off I went. Another rock hopping opportunity. Just like before, I went left. Two steps later I stopped just to check. Yup, I was about to make the same mistake again. If you are hiking this area be aware that there are many paths that appear before you. The AT's blazes are there (if you look for them.) There are numerous stealth camp sites available in this area too. As I passed Walnut Mountain Shelter, my mind drifted back to last year's hike with David. David had told me of his night hiking to Max Patch Summit in order to catch the sunrise. I wasn't up to such hiking then and told him I'd meet him there after waking up in the morning. Well David confessed that hiking in the dark was kind of spooky so he sang Harry Chapin tunes out loud to himself to let any bears in the area know that he was coming through. After setting up our tents at the Walnut Mountain Shelter area, a hiker with a full dark beard came out of his tent saying that he was catching up on his sleep because of what happened last night - he kept hearing songs while trying to sleep in his tent that was setup a few feet off the trail. David confessed to being the singer and we all had a good laugh. That was our initial introduction to Wilderness Man. He was a self-proclaimed man from the mountains and told us about, as he called them, Mountain People, and how they were often misunderstood. Later that night after David was temporarily named ""ITunes"" by Wilderness Man, we sat around a fire pit with a father from Florida hiking with his daughter and her beach volleyball partner. It was then that Wilderness Man was heard ""No. Get out of here! Come on, git"", then we heard him mutter that he'd left his tent's fly open and a mouse had entered to have some of his Cheetos. The entertainment he provided was great. Wilderness Man told us the next morning how he had to bribe the mouse to go away by placing a Cheeto outside his tent that night because the mouse kept on trying to get into his tent. Wish I could run into Wilderness Man to give him the update that last year's ""someday I'd like to hike the AT"" was happening now.The hike today was a bit long but Hot Springs was the destination and Blues Brother greeted me as I came down the final path. Hot Springs, like Franklin, is designated as an AT Hiker-Friendly town - my term but there is a more institutional name for towns like this. Everybody in town greets and welcomes you. I decided to stay in Alpine Court instead of the usual hiker spots. I met Bobbie Faulkner as I walked up and she told me to have a seat since she figured I'd hiked a good bit today. Alpine Court just changed ownership and they just opened today with me as their first customer. Bobbie said that God made the mountains around here before all others and then didn't make any others like them. Great to be here tonight.","Max Patch Summit

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523340,"The AT literally goes through Hot Springs. White Blazes are replaced here by AT symbols embedded in the side walk leading in and out of this community. Today was a zero, non-hiking, day that allowed me to do laundry, clean gear, restore my internet capability that somehow disappeared the night before, upload pictures, get caught up on trailjournals, make phone calls, and mingle with other hikers and people in town who wanted to discuss the AT or Hot Springs. And get some rest and non-hiker food too. I hadn't seen Papa Monkey in a week or two but saw him a couple times today. He had taken a zero here yesterday. Papa Monkey has added beef jerkey to supplement the gorp combination he's been eating. He says he is taking vitamins too. I don't know how he is hiking these miles on so little food, but he is doing it.  I spoke with Trail Chef and his wife, Judy. Sounds like Trail Chef plans to hike the AT for a month in a few weeks. it was good to speak with them and he provided updates on other hikers. I hope to be able to hike with him when he returns to the AT. I have a long way to go yet to get to the mile marker he hiked last year. While having dinner with Blues Brother at the Spring Creek Tavern, the father of a father/son hiking team, joined our conversation. It turns out fhe father has hiked more than 1,000 miles of the AT. He downplayed his hiking as being that of a ""section hiker"" but I congratulated him and told him that he was much more of a hiker than I am since he has hiked four times as many miles on the AT as I have. I think everyone glamorizes the concept of ""thru-hiking"" and I understand the dream associated with it but 1,000 miles is 1,000 miles - quite impressive to me. News of the AT includes troubling concern of many hikers behind us who are sick with a very contagious noro-virus. Rain is forecasted for the next two days, but Blues Brother and I will return to the AT tomorrow morning with the added motivation of maintaining some distance from the hiker bubble and the illness that may be coming with them. It's been a good day here and will be good to resume hiking again.","Hot Springs, NC

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523503,"Today could've turned out very differently if not for special people.The waitress at Smoky Mountain Diner unlocked the door a few minutes before today's stated opening hours of business. She apparently saw me walk up with my backpack loaded. A local man had similarly been let in early and we spoke of weather, Hot Springs, and the AT.Blues Brother arrived and we placed our orders because we really didn't want to night hike and we failed to consider the initial day of daylight savings time when we agreed on today's starting time. A few minutes later, Brave, Strong(?), and an unfamiliar person came in through the door. Brave gave a big ""Good Morning Rabbit!"" as she went by. I returned her greeting as I recalled meeting her in Hot Springs the afternoon before. Brave returned a few minutes later with an invitation to join them for breakfast - so we did.They had been to Max Patch Summit the night before so with that the AT conversation ensued. Alice introduced herself and showed a picture of her husband and her after he successfully finished his thru-hike last year. Blues Brother and I ate our meals while they were hot since we had arrived first. Soon we were all eating. The waitress brought over our bills for breakfast and I pulled out a $10 bill to cover my share and then handed it over to Blues Brother. Brave asked me to give her the bill so that she could provide trail magic. I was taken back by her kind gesture and asked how she could do such a thing. She responded with a simple ""you pay it forward to someone else"" and then she reviewed the actions to take upon the onset of hypothermia. Brave and Strong are currently traveling between the AT starting point and Irwin, Tennessee to provide hikers with educational hiker tips. Strong was a successful thru-hiker last year. They each spoke with clarity and certainty. A newbie like me took it all in now just like I did yesterday when I was called over by them from their car with Brave's ""Are you thru-hiking?"" question. Kindness like this are encountered while hiking the AT. These, and other Trail Angels, dispense everything from encouraging words to special treats with no specific expectations of reciprocation. Trail Angels do such things out of the goodness of their hearts and their desire to make a hiker's day. What a start as we began our departure from Hot Springs.The hike out was difficult which was expected. With our resupplied consumables, our packs were heavy. The trail that descended into Hot Springs now continued with a climb to get us back up into a mountain ridge, since that is essentially what the AT is - a pathway of scenic trail across the mountain ridges between Georgia to Maine. It was cloudy with an occasional sprinkle but was better weather than had been forecasted. Blues Brother and I encountered other thru-hikers we previously met - Baked Beans, Going Postal, and Sooner Or Later. This day of hiking was near its end when the trail came to a road crossing that had ""Moms"" in the distance. Blues Brother reported that Moms wasn't open yet for this hiking season so no cold soft drinks were available. We each expressed sadness that we couldn't stop in at this spot each of us had previously read about. Water sources today were adequate and there were a number of camp sites spread throughout today's hike.The upcoming shelter only was built for 5 hikers. We had already seen 2 who were headed there and knew of others who potentially intended to stay there overnight. The elevation was +5000 feet and thunderstorms were forecast for today and tomorrow. With more hikers than available shelter space and with no desire to experience tenting through a thunderstorm, Blues Brother walked .7 mile off the AT to stay at an open year-round facility named Hemlock Hollow Inn that provided as accommodations ranging from tenting, to bunks in a hostel, to private cabins - each with the option for a shower and Wifi access for a fee.It seemed like a longer walk but maybe we were just tired. People outside waved to us as we walked up. A couple about my age was scouting this location because they intend to thru-hike next year. We provided info about experiences to date and wished them success as they drove away. That's when we learned that Hemlock Holiday Inn had just changed ownership and wouldn't be opened for two weeks. Okay, that was a PROBLEM. We were tired. The shelter at 5000 feet would now probably be filled by the time we'd arrive and then it began to rain. And then it began to pour. The new owner's stepson let us wait under the main building's covered porch as he told us of the ownership change. The rain was heavy but finally ended before 5:00 with the thought that we'd return to the AT to hike 4 miles to the shelter, hiking that was a pretty steep climb and hiking that would get us their near nightfall with the forecast for thunderstorms.Kindness again. The stepson said he didn't want to put us out at this time of day. We accepted his offer to stay in any capacity available since our odds were not good to successfully settle in somewhere on the AT before nightfall. So were extended stay in the hostel as the stepson's friends. The hostel facility was great. A clean cabin with bunk beds, a table to eat at, a nearby flushing toilet, potable water - everything we had hoped for when we walked in a couple hours earlier. And then it got better. The stepson brought us towels so that we could take a hot shower.So tonight ended with us dry, clean, fed, hydrated, and able to go to sleep with the nearby creek's gurgling water providing soothing sounds. We feel very fortunate today. Trail Angels and their acts of kindness - Thank You!!!","Hot Springs, NC

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523541,"Today had a bit of everything. Blues Brother and I started with our .7 gravel road walk back to the trail. The 1300 foot climb through woodsy trail quickly got our attention. There were some new faces when we stopped at Little Laurel Shelter. After telling how lucky we were last night at Hemlock Hollow Inn, we learned that PCT thru-hiker HoHo and his two hiking companions were turned away when they arrived there at 8:00 last night. HoHo was deep into a PCT conversation with another hiker as we moved on. I learned later in the day that this ""other hiker"" was ""Tattoo Joe"" or ""Tattoo Jack"" - after he finishes the AT this year, he'll be the 5th or 6th hiker to do the Triple Crown twice. The Triple Crown consists of the AT, the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail. Tattoo began the AT March 2nd so he averages 25 miles per day. HoHo admitted that he is considering the Continental Divide Trail next year to complete his Triple Crown, assuming he completes the AT this year. So flying by me today were some outstanding hikers.My notes from past trailjournal hikers indicated that the AT was steep and a bit scary/dangerous after Little Laurel Shelter. I came through this section in good weather so it was steep at times but nothing more. The trail changed from woods to small boulder scampering. This trail is fun but does require sight-specific foot placement. The trail changed again when navigating through Big Firescald Knob. This was the first part of the AT that provided an alternate path for bad weather conditions. Initially the trail just seemed challenging as it moved up and down somewhat tight stone turns. Over the course of this 1.5 mile section though it became very apparent as to why an alternative option existed. Views from Big Firescald Knob were great at the part where the AT became a tight ridge line, narrow but not scary-ledge narrow. But this section was exposed and I wouldn't want to be caught here during bad weather.Fortunately I was out of that section and crossing a bald field when the rain began. Initially the rain was refreshing but then it was heavy enough to require rain gear. Periodic rain fell most of the afternoon. Thunder accompanied a drenching downpour, but at least it was somewhat brief. Briefer still were the episodes of hail and lightning. I'm definitely not a hiker who wants to go through such weather but today's weather was manageable and never felt threatening or even annoying for that matter - it just felt like hiking through this was what is needed to hike the AT.The hiking ended with a period of no rain so ""drying by hiking"" worked to make me reasonably comfortable as I arrived at tonight's shelter destination at 4:30. I'm here in the shelter with Blues Brother, Sooner or Later, and Going Postal. Today's other hikers moved on an additional 3 miles to stay in a just-opened hostel called ""Hiker Paradise"". Conversation around dinner tonight was good with everyone ready for tomorrow's better weather. It's been raining now for more than an hour but we are dry. I'll sleep tonight thinking that the rain hitting the tin roof isn't rain but instead is like last night's gurgling creek.","Hemlock Hollow Inn

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523663,"The four of us in the shelter last night discussed today's destination. A frequent comment was that the AT is somewhat like work in that you have to get up every morning and go get the job done. Then the smiles came across each of our faces as someone said ""Great work if you can get it!""Big climbs today - the first totaled 1600 feet and the last one at the end of the day was 1200 feet. Other climbs were mixed in within the day's almost 19 miles.The people we met on the trail made the day though. Sandy was hiking and provided pop tarts and good wishes. She said we made her day; hope she knows she made ours with her enthusiasm about thru-hiking. Then came Yonder, a 2007 thru-hiker, who hiked from Sams Gap with trail magic apple fritters; I got the last one. It's always great to meet thru-hikers and ask them what were there favorite aspects of the AT. Yonder loved Maine and New Hampshire. He said he tells hikers to never quit and instead jump North and hike there before ending a thru-hike. Yonder was pretty convincing that hiking the northern-most states will end all thoughts of not thru-hiking and instead will create the desire for a ""flip-flop"" which is a continuous hike, just not consistently in the same direction. Then there was the pail of trail magic left right after Sams Gap - I got an orange and a package of Starbursts there. Lastly was Diamond Doug, who thru-hiked in 2000 and now maintains the trail between Big Bald Mountain and Big Bald Mountain Shelter. What a treat to have Diamond Doug point out mountains in every direction; identifying those we've hiked, those we will encounter ahead on the AT, and those that we won't hike now since they aren't on the AT. The pride he takes as being a trail maintainer was evident and his section was spotless. He's been promoted at work and leaves this area in about 4 weeks. We could tell the strain he felt as this was one of his final times being on his section. Special people, each one. Each one unique but connected to this great path that brings so many different people together.And we hiked too. We hiked our butts off today. It was exhausting. Could we have done it without the trail magic? None of us wanted to think about it. The initial climb to Lick Rock was hard. It was nicely graded, but it was a long climb and left us needing to make sure we were replenishing ourselves with food and water. We carry both but the trail magic provided the element of surprise in terms of food and intangible enthusiasm and good spirits. On the way to Lick Rock, the cascading water was incredible - the sight and sounds gave us plenty to take-in as we climbed. The blue blaze was a short distance and the views provided from High Rock felt like another form of trail magic - you're hiking and aware that mountain ridges are beyond the trees that line both sides of the AT and then you arrive at a ledge with an unobstructed view that just stops you in your tracks. The climb up Big Bald Mountain was borderline torture. Don't think we're really ready for such tough climbs at the end of the day but the payoff was worth it. Big Bald Mountain provides views that rival Max Patch. We would've tented there tonight except that our water was inadequate. Except for the shelter water sources, afternoon water sources were barely running or were dry. This Bald Mountain Shelter sleeps 10. It is one of the nicer shelters with a great water source.Lucky to be here with Blues Brother, Sooner Or Later, Going Postal, and a new hiker - Mostly. Mostly thru-hiked in 2007 and intends to do a yo-yo this year. A yo-yo hiker typically begins at Springer Mountain in Georgia, completes the hike in Maine, and then turns around and hikes back to Georgia - I know, incredible.","Flint Mountain Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523768,"Today's hike was relatively easy. It didn't have yesterday's big climbs and was primarily downhill. Blues Brother and I laughed as we struggled up today's climbs. Tattoo Joe says there is nothing easy on the AT, just some climbs that aren't as difficult as the others. Water sources were plentiful again. Within the first few minutes of today's hike I saw 3 white-tailed deer and a red sunrise that isn't captured in the photo. The hiking started off fast at almost 3 miles per hour for the first two hours. Then the trail returned to the look for every next step hiking instead of being able to hike and look up. Blues Brother said he was somewhat bored by the continuos hiking around mountains. I liked it as I was pleasantly surprised with the realization that the next 5 - 15 minutes weren't going to leave me panting for air and soaking my shirt in sweat again. As ""easy"" as it was, I found myself struggling today. Could be lack of sleep. Could be yesterday's hard day. After the first couple hours I found myself just getting by with little zip in my steps. Extra food and water didn't seem to help.My day changed when I met 30+ and Firefly. Firefly thru-hiked in 2011 and 30+ ended his thru-hike due to a foot injury. Today 30+ was clearing obstacles from the trail while Firefly was repainting white blazes. Great people doing trail maintenance. Loved the origin of 30+ trail name - his goal was to lose 30 pounds while hiking the AT. He met that goal, then laughed when he said he has since put the weight back on.Nubs was another hiker Blues Brother and I met today. Nubs was returning to the trail today after recovering from losing multiple finger tips when he put out a tent fire caused by his cooking in his tent on a very cold day. It was hard to believe that he was back out here. His fingers looked very painful. Firefly recommended that we stay at Cantarroso Farm when we arrived in Erwin to resupply. Really glad we listened to her as this place is fantastic. Blues Brother and I are in a 2 bed cabin for $25 each. The trip into town for dinner and to pick up additional supplies cost another $8 which seemed very fair. The owners - Peggy and Mike - are very friendly. We're the first to be here this year. If you are hiking this way, get here. As this place becomes better known, I think it will fill up just like Hiker Hostel. Blues Brother caught a bass today using fishing gear made available for those who stay here. I enjoyed watching and listening to the rapids on the Nolichucky River that is the back of their property. You just never know what's coming on the AT.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523870,"Today was a Nero, meaning minimal hiking. This was done intentionally to set up the Roan Mountain hike in a couple days. In hindsight it might have been a better idea to have hiked more mileage today but what is done is done. Today was fun. Leisurely departure from Cantarroso Farm with shuttle over to Uncle Johnny's . It was good to catch up with hikers there. Papa Monkey headed out before noon. TJ and Morgan arrived - hikers I hadn't seen for about a week. It was then that I apologized to Morgan as it had taken me a while to realize that Morgan was Morgan from Florida, who I had met on Day 1 on the way to Springer Mountain. TJ and Morgan had just done a 32 mile day yesterday and plan to take a zero tomorrow. I saw Morgan purchasing a substantial amount of food and asked him how his weight is doing. He looks great but he's doing what he can to not lose any more weight since he's already lost 26 pounds.Today is my 31st day out here. AT mileage to date totals 346 for an average of 11 miles per day. Am pretty pleased with those totals. It's pleasing to realize that I am keeping up with some of these strong, young hikers but know that there are some hikers who arrive at resupply points and leave so quickly that I never speak with them to know just how fast some hikers are moving. For example, I can't fathom hiking 32 miles in a day. This is my hike though and it's good to be where I am and feeling as good as I feel. Hey, I haven't broken a finger in a while so that counts for something.The question has been asked about whether and how I receive news while hiking out here. It depends on your definition of news. News here involves water sources, weather forecasts, updates about other hikers, resupply points, and ""don't miss this upcoming attraction"" or ""did you see that"" moments. Hikers have a unique version of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and what's going on in the non-hiking world is very distant. I didn't realize how quickly this transition takes place and I am not saying I think this transition is right, but my sense is that my perspective on this is shared by other hikers. Patches, a nice guy who Blues Brother and I are with tonight, was asked by his dad recently as to what he thinks about while he hikes. Patches' response was that 75% of the time he thinks about food. I forget his other categories and percentages except that that only 5% involved non-hiking areas of interest. The one constant connection to the ""real"" world is communications exchanged with loved ones and my recognition of the joy associated with trailjournal messages. I need to speak with Beth regularly. Two days without speaking with her has not happened often and is not something that I think would be tolerable. Beth gets me up to speed about loved ones and our closest friends - often with laughter - and I share updates about hikers she has never met but now has taken such an interest in. I get a second helping of these topics via messaging with my daughter Anne, who often uploads these entries for me. A big surprise is the trailjournals messaging. I am now in touch with some of my closest and dearest friends and relatives in frequency and a level of interaction that far exceeds my interaction when I was at home in the ""real"" world. It is a bit weird to realize this and is something I hope to figure out better. Right now I just know that e-mails are a highlight every day and that e-mails from everyone are so important whether from those known for decades or from those connected via this hike. Would I like to know more about the ""real"" world - Yes. But I get by getting pretty consistent word that my loved ones are doing okay and that some are enjoying this writing of my adventure. I literally see the sun come up every morning and am acutely aware of when it goes down every night. One month in. Lots more to discover. Please keep the messages coming and thank you for them. There's plenty of time to think out here and appreciating all of you is one of those that makes it easier to go up and down these mountains.","Cantarroso Farm in Erwin,TN

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523989,"Blues Brother and I have been aware that a storm is heading this way. It seems likely to arrive at a time we'd rather not experience it - Roan Mountain and its 6000 foot elevation. So our hiking plan changed a bit to provide options depending on an updated forecast. Today's hiking destination became Greasy Creek Gap, 20 miles away. There were multiple climbs, including Unaka Mountain, to push through. Given our 2 miles per hour average, we started hiking right after daylight. I started hiking with Patches. He is a young guy I first met briefly in Hot Springs. Patches is from Indiana and he has 4 months to complete his hike. He hikes a minimum of 20 miles per day so I knew I'd not be able to stay with his pace for long but I wanted whatever additional time I could get witmh him. Patches, Blues Brother and I had stayed up way past hiker midnight last night talking all things AT and sharing a little about who we were. As we talked, it became apparent that Patches was the type of person whose company everyone will enjoy. Patches hiked the first week with his girlfriend. He winced as he told of the misery they encountered while she hiked with him. His girlfriend named him Patches in recognition of his first week's facial hair that is here and there, but definitely not going to fill in everywhere. Beth arrives in a week for her first visit, I am wondering if I didn't already have a trail name whether she'd name me ""Nice Try"". I stayed with Patches until I stopped to take my first picture of the day. Patches was polite and stopped, turned around, and came back. I wished him the best and ""released"" him so that he could accomplish his hike's goals - I could tell that he was respecting my age and needed to hear that I was okay with his moving on. Great guy, another that I hope to hear good things about up the trail. I hiked alone for most of the morning. I was moving pretty quickly - maybe Patches's pace was an inspiration. Blues Brother was surprised to be ahead of me and I told him I'd gone off the trail to take care of business - Tennessee shelters don't have privies so you have to dig a cat hole and I chose to dig mine far from the trail. Which reminds me, I don't think I've mentioned ""How To Shit In The Woods"" - that's the name of the book. Millions of copies have been sold, in many languages. The book is hilarious and informative. Sorry if this is more than you want to know. So Blues Brother told me that he got big time trail magic that arrived after I had already passed that point. It sounded delicious and I learned from another hiker that the same person was there last year too. I told Blues Brother he missed getting a good laugh at my expense when he missed my 3rd fall of this trip. This fall was complete. I went down face-forward with hands and knees all embracing the ground. A couple scrapes but, fortunately, no damage done except for pride.Beauty Spot was properly named. It provided gorgeous views in all directions. This wasn't named as a bald, but I am learning that these balds would be perfect locations to tent. Unaka Mountain offered no views, despite its 5180 feet, but it gave a dense spruce forest that was wonderful to experience. Tall trees with new growth at various stages depending on the openings created by fallen trees.Twenty miles provided plenty of tired moments but all in all this was a great day of hiking.","Curley Maple Gap Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524097,"Big decision today. Hike or Zero? Storm was a big concern the night before and today's hike was 6000 feet elevation with multiple climbs to get up and over Roan Mountain. The morning sky and radar looked favorable so we got a late start but got a full day of hiking. The hike up Roan Mountain has trail that is beautifully maintained. The graded climbs let you enjoy the hike and there is plenty to enjoy around Roan Mountain. The camp site pictured seems too good to be true. People who live in this area and who enjoy hiking are really fortunate to have such a place. Since this was Saturday, we saw many day hikers, particularly at Carvers Gap where it seemed many hiked Jane Bald for the views. The weather cooperated until Jane Gap when rain began and continued until the end of the hiking day. Blues Brother and I are in Overmountain Shelter. This is a beautiful shelter that originally was a barn.Continuing with the ""news"" topic begun yesterday. Since March Madness is underway it is inevitable that trash talking is out there. Here on the AT, Blues Brother is riding Colin pretty hard about his trail name of the ""Big O"" which stands for the Big Oriental (Colin has embraced it). Blues Brother wants Colin's trail name changed to the ""Big Zero"" since Colin is several days behind us after taking a few zeroes for his knees and noro virus.The bigger news involves the Greasy Creek Hostel where we stayed last night. Happy to report that the Battle of Greasy Creek is over. The battle involved a nasty neighbor of Connie, the hostel owner. This neighbor for years undermined Connie's ability to welcome hikers. I saw one example last night in the form of a sign that stated that the hostel was closed due to a death in the family. Another example involved the neighbor apparently misdirecting hikers away from the hostel. Lastly, the neighbor banged pans early in the morning to annoy hikers as they attempted to sleep. Blues Brother and I came to this hostel, in part, to support Connie and get a status on this situation. Was happy to hear that the battle ended when Gadget, a 2015 hiker whose thru-hike ended due to injury, confronted the neighbor and pursued a permanent end to the battle by pursuing a legal outcome that ended within mediation. Yeah Gadget!Connie's Greasy Creek Hostel is a one of a kind experience and Connie is a caring person with a heart of gold. I am so happy to have met Connie and Gadget, two characters within this AT journey.","Greasy Creek Gap

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524245,"Today was a Nero of 9.2 miles that was over by noon. Resupply was needed for the hike to Damascus, Virginia. Overmountain Shelter was spacious and we had a glimpse of the valley below it before last night's sunset. Overmountain Shelter originally was a barn so it can accommodate as many as 24 hikers and maybe more. A Boy Scout Troop made up about half of the shelter's visitors and there was good dialogue between hikers and the scouts.Shades, a successful thru-hiker last year, and Dan were here on Spring break from Liberty University. They are strong hikers and were great conversationalists with the scouts, the scout leaders, or other hikers. Shades provided trail magic to another hiker when he gave the hiker his Sawyer water filter upon hearing that the hiker's water filter wasn't working. Dan offered Blues Brother and me a ride to a Dollar General so that Blues Brother and I could resupply at the end of today's hike. Then, they offered to take us to a restaurant to have lunch with them. We each had a double bacon cheeseburger as part of our meal. I'm not certain that hiker hunger has arrived yet but the food at Bob's Dairy Delight was awfully good. Dan and Shades have offered to shuttle Blues Brother and me again when the AT passes close to Liberty University in the coming days. I've read prior year's trailjournal accounts that refer to the good future ahead given hikers experiences with young men and women and I'm hard pressed not to say the same thing. Dan is studying graphic arts and he's heading to Colorado soon where he'll pursue his passion for free climbing. Shades sounds like he is seriously considering a stint with the Army after getting his degree in mechanical engineering. Yes, I'm a very old guy to be speaking with these two. The AT just brings all ages together as we hike. Today's hike evolved from the disappointment of a foggy morning. Blues Brother saw it snow in the middle of the night. It was fun seeing Blues Brother enjoy the falling snow later in the day when he said that he had seen more falling snow today than he sees in an entire year in Mississippi. The climb up Little Hump Mountain was quick and was followed by flat hiking before beginning to climb Hump Mountain. Somewhere between the two climbs we were treated to special scenery. The disappointment of a foggy day transitioned into a ice-covered display of more than a mile. Open fields of rim ice and trees with frosted covers were beautiful and created a landscape of enchantment that only Hollywood can seemingly create. Blues Brother and I acknowledged this moment as we said in unison ""Are you seeing this?"" The morning's fog lifted with the two of us hiking several hundred yards apart. I got to see Blues Brother climbing over one of Hump Mountain's false summits. From that vantage point, Blues Brother told me later in the day that he saw me furious climbing with my hiking poles flailing and then was happy to see me turn around, stop, and pull out my phone to capture the view with a photo. As the fog lifted we were above clouds but we're now given views of the surrounding mountains and countryside. I can't remember his exact comment, but Blues said something along the lines of knowing then why we were climbing this section. I can only hope that my photos captured these scenes because many who hike through here in all kinds of weather aren't able to see such a combination of weather and scenery.Mountain Harbour Hiker Hostel provides our quarters for today. Tessa, now having a trail name of ""Rocky"" in recognition of her Philadelphia roots, was already here when we arrived. Blues Brother first met Rocky at Laughing Heart Hostel in Hot Springs where I had also briefly been introduced. The conversation between us came easily as we shared our findings of the AT's first few hundred miles. Fresh Ground, a legendary provider of trail magic who is thru-hiking this year, joined us mid-afternoon with news of heavier snow falling where Blues Brother and I had passed in the morning. Our heated lodging felt all the better after hearing that news. As of tonight it sounds like we all envision a similar sequence en route to Damascus. What is apparent though is that you never know what unfolds on the AT, it just seems to happen.","Overmountain Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524409,"Bright and breezy today. A bit cold throughout the day but good weather for hiking. The day started with breakfast at Mountain Harbour Hiker Hostel. Mike and Shannon provide a scrumptious meal that is a real treat. The whole experience at Mountain Harbour was great and I highly recommend this as a stop to rest and resupply after Erwin, TN. The hostel has a great room with sofa, comfortable chairs, kitchen, bathroom, shower, and a loft where most of us slept. The room enabled all of us (Blues Brother, Rocky, Fresh Ground, Earl, and me) to enjoy getting to know each other as we spread out our packs to resupply from the General Store and do laundry. That good vibe continued before and after breakfast with all but Earl agreeing on today's destination some 18 miles away.Want to mention and thank Shannon for her hospitality. She really made me feel welcome and it was touching to hear how the hostel first opened when cold hikers showed up at their door years ago. These hostels are often labors of love and you can't help but feel very connected to people like Shannon. Fresh Ground pointed out that he thinks getting to know hostel owners provides a great component of the AT experience and I heartily agree.Fresh Ground is a great story teller. One story involved Trail Hoarder, who got his name because of his frequent practice of adding to his pack items available from other hikers in ""hiker boxes"" that are often created in hostels to help hikers leave items they no longer want. Fresh Ground told of how the hiking competitive juices sometime emerge between hikers to give them the ""I'm a stronger hiker than you"" distinction. In this story, Fresh Ground saw Trail Hoarder resting so he hiked passed him to establish his stronger hiking credentials. Trail Hoarder arrived at that night's location saying he was ""through hiking"". Fresh Ground and others agreed that they were all ""thru-hiking"" only to be confronted by Trail Hoarder who told the that today's experience with Fresh Ground made him want to stop hiking. Apparently Trail Hoarder had fallen, needed help, and began to cry after Fresh Ground blew by him. Fresh Ground explained the competitive angle and how he didn't realize that Trail Hoarder needed assistance. Trail Hoarder continued hiking the next day. Hilarious and Fresh Ground tells this story better than this writing of it.I had difficulty hiking today, never getting into any flow. Jones Falls is a short side trip that is definitely worthwhile. If hiking passed it, consider stopping there for a long break or meal. Blues Brother did just that - and got so taken away by it all that he forgot which direction to go when returning to the AT and ended up hiking in the wrong direction for a mile.Blues Brother's misfortune turned out to be good for me as I followed his lead and pace the rest of the day. Blues clearly slowed for me and I appreciated his doing that today. He later told Rocky and Fresh Ground how he had similarly tracked me en route to Overmountain Shelter a couple days earlier.Tenting sites and water was plentiful all day. Less than a mile before today's destination, Blues Brother caught up with Rocky. And then with a tenth of a mile left, the three of us caught up with Fresh Ground, who had stopped along the trail to make a few phone calls since he had access there. So the four who started this morning hiked in line to tonight's shelter. It's a bit cold but warmer weather arrives overnight. Blues Brother and Fresh Ground started a fire in the fire pit and that made for additional time getting to know each other and telling stories as we all warmed up.One last entry to remember today. Thanks to Steve from Bennington, VT for sharing his experience with his seventeen-month old granddaughter. Steve said his granddaughter was fascinated by my photos and kept doing her hand motion for ""more"" as they looked through them. I am enjoying taking the photos and this story has a smile on my face as I drift off to sleep tonight.","Mountain Harbour Hiker Hostel - US 19E

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524520,"Just an incredible day today. A cold morning that became a summer-like day. Solo hiking stopped around 10:00 when three of us began hiking together (Blues Brother, Fresh Ground, and me.) Trail Magic came early as Seminole, Florida placed a hanging bag of Snickers bars as we arrived at Dennis Cove Road. Thank you Semiole, Florida - what a way to make our morning! Fresh Ground wanted additional food so he headed off to Black Bear Resort with Blues Brother watching his backpack as I headed off to meet and say thank you to Bob Peoples, known to be an extremely active trail maintainer on many miles of AT we had just hiked. Bob wasn't there but my spirits sky-rocketed when Fresh Ground gave me an iced Honey Bun and a cold can of root beer he had purchased. The energy from the Snickers, Honey Bun, and soda propelled our hiking and our spirits.Laurel Falls is a must-see attraction where you could easily spend an hour or more watching the waterfall, dip your toes, or swim (in warmer weather). Signs warn of not going beneath the falls as a father and son died there when they were caught in a dangerous whirlpool beneath the falls. We took time to enjoy the location and posed for some photos. The AT follows the stream for a while before beginning a 1700 foot climb in 2.6 miles. Blues Brother led the way with Fresh Ground and Blues Brother creating so much laughter that made this hard climb bearable. But make no mistake, this is a hard climb despite its many switchbacks. Just as the climb was long, so too was the descent. We had a number of views of beautiful Watuga Lake. We used the picnic area as our rest stop around 3:00. Pretty late for lunch. The laughter continued here with Fresh Ground enjoying recently obtained BBQ Chips (you had to be there). Fresh Ground then changed the course of our day when he asked about our interest in hiking to a hostel and getting Subway or McDonalds for dinner. So off we went.The hike to town was 2.6 miles but I stuck out my thumb and Lindsay (Trail Name Ferin) immediately stopped with room for one - me! Thank you Lindsay, you helped today's great day just get better. Backpacks for Blues Brother & Fresh Ground were also placed in the car before I was taken to Brown's Grocery. Brown's has a great resupply variety and if I were planning a hike through here I'd plan to resupply at Brown's and stay at his nearby Braemar Castle Hostel. Shortly after Blues Brother & Fresh Ground arrived, a car stopped at Brown's with a number of hikers we knew - Morgan, Going Postal, Mostly, and Rambo. Better yet, the car was driven by Bob Peoples who graciously chatted with me and Jim (another trail maintainer I was speaking with when Bob's car pulled up. It was a real treat speaking with them and hearing about the effort expended on the trail we'd just walked. Subway and McDonalds for dinner.

Today's miles would enable Thursday night arrival in Damascus, VA. So we were up and out early, Don Sutton drove us back to yesterday's stopping point. Minutes after 7:00, we began hiking in the dark. The trail around Watauga Lake was easy but then the day's 1600 foot climb began. Blues Brother, Fresh Ground, and I hiked together as a group with Fresh Ground leading and setting the pace. Who Dat joined us late in the day and is with us in the shelter tonight.Laughter begun yesterday continued today. We stopped at shelters to eat. At the first shelter I was laughing so hard that it was difficult to eat as much food as I would've liked. Fresh Ground reminds me of Forrest Gump in terms of his classic phrases and I told him I wish I was recording them. I don't know how many times Fresh Ground said that this next climb would be the last of the day until finally it was the last climb. We hiked 23.5 miles in 10 hours and a few minutes. We took 3 breaks of a good period of time. No question that I tired as the day went on and I was glad the day ended. A saying on the trail out here is ""It's about the smiles, not the miles."" Today I got lots of smiles over many miles. Another great day out here.","US 321 - Hampton, TN - Braemar Castle Hostel

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524768,"The AT continues to surprise. First surprise was that Fresh Ground vacated the shelter area before sunrise and hiked out in the dark. I thought a bear might've eaten him whole because he sleeps with his foodbag beneath him, but no such luck as we caught up with him hours later. Second surprise was seeing Sir Charles, black chihuahua, shown in the picture sitting on top of Joe's backpack as Joe hikes.No surprise was that Who-Dat is a great guy. I hiked with Who-Dat for a couple hours at the start of the day. It gave us time to talk and learn about each other and our hikes. Who-Dat is an Air Force veteran, specifically a ""PJ"" that means Parachute Jumper. Wow, the military hikers are significant in number out here and even more impressive individuals. My understanding is that Who-Dat's role was to parachute wherever required to rescue downed Air Force personnel. This includes parachuting behind enemy lines. Who-Dat is trained to medically treat the personnel being rescued as well as navigating the terrain to return to a safe location. Who-Dat served in Afghanistan. He joined the Air Force when he was seventeen. After Blues Brother caught up with us, Blues Brother and Who-Dat discussed various deployments. Blues Brother is an Army veteran who served in Iraq. The war towns they discussed were locations I recognized by name, except they served in these combat areas. I was getting so much more than a hike on the AT today. All I could do was listen and then admit that my feeble ""Thank you for your service"" felt inadequate. I asked what words should be expressed to show gratitude to them and Blues Brother said ""Thank You."" Before Blues Brother joined us, Who-Dat openly shared his faith. It was just yesterday that Fresh Ground shared his. I was with Subman & Suds and Trail Chef and Judy enough to experience their faith. I haven't had discussions and experiences like these for many years. It is pretty powerful and all with the AT and its beauty in the background.We caught up with Fresh Ground in time to hike as a group of four for a couple hours. Today's hike was mostly downhill and that was good because I think all of us were feeling the impact of yesterday's long hike. The joking between us flows so easily. I hope to remember Fresh Ground's playful comment that this climb that is giving us all we can handle is ""the last climb of the day.""We'd heard so many good things about Woodchuck Hostel that it became our destination in Damascus, VA. Virginia already. We left Tennessee for the last time after leaving North Carolina earlier this week. Hard to believe we've come this far. Damascus is often referred to as the best trail town on the AT. Woodchuck Hostel is certainly going to be among the best hostels. Woodchuck is a former thru-hiker and his hotel is extremely welcoming. Booty, who I last saw in Newfound Gap is here recovering from a stomach bug. Morgan, as I met him on Day 1, turns out to be Medic, that Fresh Ground speaks so highly of. The banter in this expanded group is upbeat. Subman & Suds send me a message that they will leave Mountain Harbour Hostel tomorrow. Zach (Teach) and Angela (Steady) got engaged at Overmountain Shelter.

It seemed like most thru-hikers in Damascus were staying at Woodchuck Hostel already and we welcomed HoHo, his dad, and Chickery (HoHo's girlfriend who hiked PCT last year, hiked AT southbound before that, and who has decided to join HoHo for the reminder of his hike to Maine) too.Beth arrived for her first AT visit just in time for the meal so she got to meet and enjoy everyone's company as this meal was shared.Bubbles of thru-hikers gather together like this in shelters and hostels.

Love those peanut butter cookies! It was a great day as Beth and I had the whole day together. Sleeping in and then enjoying the continental breakfast at Damascus Inn got the day off to a great start. Holcomb, a thru-hiker many miles ahead of me, had written a recommendation that I try the Virginia Creeper Trail so that is what we did. Virginia Creeper Trail is a ""rails to trails"" conversion, a scenic trail available for hiking, biking, or horseback riding that was originally the Virginia Creeper Railroad's path. Beth and I were shuttled with bikes near the top of Whitetop Mountain. From there we let gravity take over to glide us down the pathway back to Damascus. Many others were with us at the beginning so we took our time and probably finished the course in last place; perfect because it let us ride side-by-side at various times to enjoy being with each other. Very little energy was expended and future thru-hikers should consider spending a great 4 hours in this way. Fresh Ground resumed hiking today and I diligently looked for him at several intersections of the AT and the Virginia Creeper Trail. Beth commented that she was on the AT today, realizing that my footsteps will be coming by tomorrow or the next day. Great weather for such a ride as it was sunny and mid-60's. We returned in time for me to set-up a different tent that I'll begin to use. The tent I started with worked fine but I found my skills lacking and wanted to switch to my Six Moon Designs Lunar Duo tent to give me more space and be comfortable during rain. This tent is a bit heavier than the Echo 1 Shelter System but since Beth was taking home most of my winter gear I rationalized carrying the heavier tent now. A quick trip to Mt. Rogers Outfitters for a pack tune-up made me more comfortable and confident about the lighter load I'll be carrying. My pack weight with 3.5 days of food and 2 liters of water is now 29 pounds so hiking should be a bit easier.Dinner was quick and filling but got us back in time before the Villanova/Kansas men's basketball game. It was way past hiker midnight so I couldn't keep my eyes open for much of it but I did catch the final minute to realize that David is happy with tonight's outcome.So far I've been happy every day out here but I find myself very happy today.

We each had places to go today so we had another great breakfast at Damascus Inn and then got around to doing the hard part - saying goodbye. Hope it gets easier each time; it wasn't as bad as the first time, but it wasn't easy either. I stopped in at Damascus Presbyterian Church to say a prayer of thanks. It came just minutes after Beth waved goodbye. I knew it would be hard and it was. The man who greeted me was very understanding and asked me to come back as I headed out.It took at least a half hour to focus on the trail but the reality of the initial climb eventually forced the focus to be there. With fresh legs, I began envisioning a big mileage day. The trail was good and I was making good time. A couple Dads passed by with their sons and that made me miss the family gathering that normally takes place on Easter at our house. Then a thru-hiker approached - it was Tigger, who I've seen a few times as we briefly came across each other in shelters or hostels. Tigger said he thought i was a northbound thru-hiker and I said I was. So Tigger pointed out that i was hiking southbound to Damascus. I had gotten turned around at a large blown down tree. It took me 40 minutes to correct my mistake, much of it uphill. Say goodbye to that big mileage day envisioned not too long ago.The AT and the Virginia Creeper Trail were one and the same in a few places. It was fun to remember yesterday with Beth. Big difference riding a bicycle downhill versus hiking uphill with a pack on your back. I looked at my watch and realized that Beth and I really could've come across Fresh Ground hiking out yesterday. Ashley stopped her ride to ask about my AT thru-hike and wish me well.Water sources were plentiful and they all were providing water. Consistent with recent days, I passed a number of campsites that aren't marked in AWOL's guide. The weather was mid-60s and for the first time it seemed that I might be sweating from sheer humidity instead of exertion.I hiked solo today as Blues Brother was going to the Baptist church service with Sooner Or Later, Mostly, Medic, and a few hikers who were staying at Woodchuck Hostel after I had left there. Hiking solo today was good, giving me time to think about many things that had been crowded out by the laughter and fun experienced when hiking in line with Blues Brother and Fresh Ground.I arrived at Lost Mountain Shelter just before 4:30 that made me think I really could've gotten another 5 miles in if I hadn't made my southbound mistake. Mama Bear and Roadkill from South Carolina were here doing a section hike. As was Kate, who was hiking solo during her Spring break. Going Postal and Sky were the only thru-hikers here. We're all hiking the same trail though and the banter between us was easy. Love Roadkill's trail name and story. His trail name came from his horrible smelling shirt. He said the shirt was ultimately burned it smelled so bad. Medic arrived shortly after I did and he commented about Beth. He asked how Beth and I met and then told me how he met his girlfriend. We both agreed that the hiking is relatively easy compared to the sadness of being away.I hiked 16.3 AT northbound miles in about 8 hours. In that same amount of time Beth should've been able to drive almost the whole way to Willow Grove, PA to visit her parents. Guess who had the more enjoyable day during those hours.Verizon doesn't provide any access in this shelter. That was a real bummer for many of us who wanted to speak with loved ones today. Rain began at 7:00, sometimes pretty hard. It could be a challenging   hike tomorrow on wet trail. Rambo arrived late carrying a message from Blues Brother that he and Sooner Or Later might be staying at the shelter before this one.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525293,"Last night's rain ended just in time for hiking to begin as soon as there was a little light. I needed to hike then because I wanted to reach a shelter that was 24 miles away. After hiking for one hour I couldn't tell if the morning would be a good one or a bad one. The view to the East looked promising, but the look to the west showed some troubling clouds. An unidentified Trail Angel left a cooler filled with sodas and treats. I drank a Grape Sunkist soda before starting to climb Whitetop Mountain, a 1900 foot climb over almost 4 miles that was nicely graded, but left you wondering if the climb would ever end. Sun was sporadic during the climb and gave hope for the day, but there was nothing but clouds and gusty winds at the summit. I was blown sideways off the trail a few times and the gusts really made for a cold start to this morning.But then the sun came out on the way to the Mt Rogers summit. Medic, the 20-year old who I met as Morgan on our first day heading towards Springer Mountain, was the first to pass me and then Rambo, another young strong hiker that was at last night's shelter passed me too. I took advantage of the open summit area to make a quick call to Beth and tried to send yesterday's journal entry to Anne to post. These journal entries are often posted by my daughter Anne and I greatly appreciate her posting them for me the next day after I don't have Internet access wherever I slept the night before. I was so cold at this point that I had to hike to avoid having my fingertips and legs stop squawking at me. I passed River, a nice lady I had briefly met at Woodchuck Hostel who was now in her second day of hiking the AT. She needed to dry out her gear because her tent had a leak in last night's downpour.Going Postal and Rambo stopped to take a meal break near the Mt Rogers summit. The wind was still an issue - and it continued to be a force all day - but now the sunshine was beaming and it was hard to believe the turnaround from the Whitetop Mountain clouds.Lacking Internet access tonight, pictures taken yesterday and today will be delayed. If you are enjoying the pictures so far then make sure you check today's pictures out because I think the landscapes shown are unlike those of the past. Mt. Rogers transitioned into Grayson Highlands State Park seamlessly. The landscape reminded me of western television shows watched many years ago. The memories of Gunsmoke, The Virginian, and The Rifleman were probably fueled by my awareness that Grayson Highlands provides a one-of-a-kind treat in the form of wild ponies roaming the land. As Going Postal and I scanned the landscape, we were rewarded with our first sighting of 3 ponies down in the valley far below us. Then as we walked a few more steps I noticed 2 ponies grazing less than 20 yards from us. These ponies, and others seen throughout the day, weren't troubled to have us passing by them. They just kept grazing as I looked for angles to take pictures. The rocky terrain, combined with the continuing wind and gusts, made for some slow and somewhat difficult hiking regardless of whether hiking up or down. I began to realize that today's hike would take many more hours than I had estimated. I can usually hike a bit faster than 2 miles per hour going downhill, but not in a path like this. Had I not been so fixated to get to Old Orchard Shelter tonight to set up my next day's hike, then I would've stopped and stayed at Wise Shelter. That is my recommendation for those hiking this route in the future. As the afternoon became late, I thought ponies and a glimpse of the Wild West were behind me but minutes after leaving Wise Shelter I was treated to 7 grazing ponies maybe 40 yards away. And then 3 miles later, the Scales livestock corral first came into view and then became the AT path I was hiking.Beautiful scenery for most of the day. Fond memories of watching westerns with my Dad were unexpected pleasures. It took slightly more than 11 hours of hiking today and I am pretty tired but today's hike was really special.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525390,"Lots of questions today. After yesterday's day of extended mileage and wind, I wondered whether I was up to hiking similar miles today. Then there were the questions of where Blues Brother and Fresh Ground were and where they intended to hike to today. I think Blues Brother is behind me by one shelter. Fresh Ground is probably one or two shelters ahead. How does this fit in with the ""hike your own hike"" mentality? I like hiking with both of them and this will be my third day essentially hiking solo.Then there was the question of my need to resupply since I started the morning with one dinner in my backpack so I knew I needed to get into town for trail food and take the opportunity to enjoy all kinds of foods when I am in town.With a 23 mile goal, I started hiking at 7:30. The initial climb up Chestnut Flats was graded nicely and let me take complete strides as I hiked. Once that summit was reached, the descent began to a level lower than the morning's starting point. I currently move faster downhill than uphill so I made good mileage in the first few hours. Downhill can be slower because of the strain put on knees and the need to not trip going downhill which could easily lead to a fall.The doe shown in the picture seemed to be as curious about me as I was about it. Medic came flying by almost trotting down the trail. Strong hikers can really move quickly on most of the trail between Old Orchard Shelter and Patnership Shelter because the trail is primairily dirt without tree roots and rocks that require slower hiking.The final climbs of the day got the better of me but fortunately I came upon Dan and Sage, a father and daughter from Maryland who were completing their section hike from Damascus. They were both seasoned hikers, who quite frankly seemed far more experienced than me. We hiked in to Partnership Shelter together talking about our hiking experiences and their upcoming May 1st plan to hike for one month from the AT's southern terminus (Springer Mountain). The final miles were a lot easier with their company.Lucky for me, Medic had ordered a pizza to be delivered to him at Partnership Shelter (one of the few places along the AT where warm food is available at a shelter) and the driver readily agreed to give me a ride to Marion. Lots of choices in Marion as this community is much bigger than the previous trail towns I've been in to resupply. I ate at a Pizza Hut so that I could get a couple plates of salad in addition to getting a pizza with plenty of toppings. I did my resupply at Walmart and just need a couple things from Marion's outfitted store in the morning before returning to the AT.This was one of my more confusing days out here. I hiked the miles but find myself still wondering about how to get reunited with Blues Brother and how we might consider hiking to catch up to Fresh Ground. These questions and my awareness of my desire to hike with AT family shouldn't surprise me given my past enjoyment with them, Subman & Suds, and Spirit Of 76 but I'd be lying if I didn't acknowledge how disproportionately important reuniting with them has become. Guess I'll figure this out in the next day or so.With Internet access available in Marion I was able to speak with Beth and upload pictures from the past few days. Wish I had taken better photos in Grayson Highlands State Park. It was so beautiful there and I don't think the photos I took adequately display its beauty. Lots to work out and lots of miles ahead.","Old Orchard Shelter
",Partnership Shelter,"Mar 29, Tue",23.20
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525541,"Today's picture answers yesterday's question. Blues Brother and Who-Dat hiked into Partnership Shelter around noon, less than a half hour after I had returned to that shelter after returning from Marion. It was a relief to be reunited with them in that it ended the uncertainty about how to proceed.There were no big photo opportunities today so it was more about getting to the destination. Who-Dat showed how strong of a hiker he is as he impressively led the way up Glade Mountain. We saw Squish and Sharkey at Chatfield Shelter. It was fun swapping stories of our adventures to date. Hikers out here now seem to know each other or have heard about each other from others. It seems like a bigger community of hikers exists now. There is genuine concern when someone mentions a hiker and shares a concern about that hiker. I think we all want to hear good news about Sooner Or Later, who Blues Brother last saw a couple days ago when Sooner Or Later wasn't feeling well. It sounded like Sooner Or Later may have just fallen victim to eating too much town food. I've experienced it when I ate too much ice cream. The temptation to eat whatever you want is great and is easily related to by all of us. It's welcome news though when you see or hear of another hiker who has overcome a physical hardship. We saw Big Critter where we went to eat and he had just hiked 25 miles today after badly spraining his ankle a couple days ago.I messed up tonight. You'd think someone my age would have grown out of high school locker room banter but I embarrassed myself when speaking inappropriately about someone I just met today. She seems very nice. Based on the miles she's hiked since she started on February 16th, she is clearly one of the best hikers out here. It doesn't really matter whether she is a good hiker or not though, what I said never should have been said. I think anyone that knows me knows that my comment was totally inconsistent with how I conduct myself. Mark (Beano to those who are reading the sign-in e-mails on my journal page) - I know you and I apologized to Scott some 20 years after we horribly treated someone who never deserved what we dished out. I am not sure how I'll be able to face this hiker again. I apologized sincerely in front of Who-Dat and Blues Brother but I know it's not enough and never will be enough. I expect so much more of myself than this. She shouldn't be exposed to such crudeness. Out here, I've read that highs are very high and lows are very low. Today's high of being reunited with Blues Brother and Who-Dat is dwarfed by my behavior. Didn't see this coming. Can't put a spin on this. I messed up. Tomorrow is another day. I hope she has a good day tomorrow and can forgive and forget. I was thinking about the importance of forgiveness last week. Today leaves me with a lot of work to do. Hiking is important out here but hiking and holding myself accountable is so much more important. What will my focus be tomorrow? Who knows. Sorry for this self-indulgent writing, but this journal is my attempt to accurately reflect what is going on out here.","Partnership Shelter

Thank you for the supporting comments about my failure yesterday. I appreciate them all. My concern continues to be with the person I offended. Gene emphasized the importance of learning from mistakes and that's where my focus will be. Early in my career, I was told as part of an early performance review that I never make the same mistake twice, but that I do make a number of mistakes. I'll be working hard to not repeat yesterday's mistake. Today's hike is typical of the mileage that hopefully will become the new norm. To achieve this mileage requires hiking 10 or more hours per day and those hours are now reasonable given that it is light until 8:00. Blues Brother and I started out hiking together just like old times. He knew I was still bothered by last night so the conversation wasn't extensive. I dropped back and worked off some unhappiness but then Big Critter caught up to me. I met Big Critter at Woodchuck Hostel. He's a nice guy, fast hiker who is headed to graduate school. He lives in Elmhurst, Illinois so we exchanged thoughts about Chicago since I spent my junior high and high school years there in a Chicago suburb. The conversation between us flowed easily. After meeting up with Blues Brother for a lunch break, Blues Brother and Big Critter took off at a pace I can't easily manage or maintain. We had passed the 1/4 point sign a few miles before the lunch break and I think we all agreed that we were happy to be this far along. Blues Brother thought he'd be farther than this whereas Big Critter and I thought we're basically where we thought we'd be. We met up again at a shelter along the trail. Rambo, another young nice guy was there along with Meda, an Irish hiker who is hiking southbound. A few miles later I briefly spoke with Swamp Turtle who also is going south. The day was long and I tired near the end. The Chestnut Knob Shelter that we are staying in is made of concrete. Rambo speculated that they had to build such a shelter to prevent the wind from blowing it down. So 25% down. Physically I am fortunate. My feet are holding up with no blisters or pain. Parts of my feet have some hard pads on them now. My knees are pretty good too. Descents are looked forward too in order to improve my time. My left knee occasionally seems to suggest that something is wrong but it seems to work itself out each day. My back seems fine too. So physically I'm doing okay. Yesterday has me disappointed in myself. The beautiful scenery has exceeded expectations. The hiking is hard but that is self-inflicted as mileage expectations periodically are increased.  Happy news today came from Subman and Suds who reported that Spirit of 76 arrived in Damascus after doing a 27 mile day. Sounds like Subman and Suds will get a bit more rest in Damascus.Thanks to all of you for sharing the highs and lows of this journey with me. Special thanks to my family for their support. I continue to miss them badly but their encouragement enables me to overcome not being at home. My ever-expanding AT bubble has exceeded expectations in terms of its size but the quality of these hikers meets the high expectations I had for them. I'll be working harder to meet what I expect of myself.","Atkins, VA - Relax Inn

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525973,"Great day today. Rain came down hard during the night but we were comfortable in Chestnut Knob Shelter, a shelter built of concrete probably because of the consistent wind that could overwhelm typical wooden shelters. The rain cleared over night though and we stepped outside to an unexpected pretty nice morning. I was in a better frame of mind than yesterday. Messages received during the last couple of days really helped so thanks again for them.The trail immediately leaving the shelter was a pretty steep decline. My notes from other trailjournals read as preparation for my hike indicated that this trail could be very slippery if wet and that's what was there today. The trail provided a pretty extensive ridge walk for quite a while. Trees prevented unobstructed views, but they almost helped by keeping the valley below appear as an endless series of lakes and streams when in reality they were clouds preventing views of the valley. I hiked alone for a couple hours before Big Critter caught me while I was speaking with Greyhound, a female flip-flop hiker who started in Buena Vista, VA who is hiking with her two uncles, Trek and Chopper. Greyhound's big news was Fresh Ground had told them he was slowing down to pick back up with hikers he had hiked with previously (us). Greyhound and I exchanged other pertinent upcoming info about the trail ahead of each of us and then wished each other well saying we hoped to see each other again in a couple months. Big Critter and I countinued to get acquainted, picking up where we left off the other day. Big Critter has to slow his pace way down when hiking with me so I considered it a compliment to hike with him. We separated on a climb when my pace needed to dip below 2 miles per hour. We each turned in to the next shelter to have lunch at the shelter's picnic table. I recognized the welcoming voice right away as Fresh Gound's. Our reunion was fun and Big Critter, never having hiked with the two of us together was amused as we relived a ""Best Of"" highlight reel. A few dayhikers arrived and asked a number of questions. Then it happened again. Fresh Ground asked one of the dayhikers to repeat what the dayhiker said just a moment earlier. So this dayhiker asked Fresh Ground if Fresh Ground was Fresh Ground's trail name because he sounded like the guy who served him coffee and food during his prior year's hike. So the laughter grew as Fresh Ground and I told more stories about how I felt hiking with such a notable AT hiker. The notoriety of Fresh Ground is all in jest and provides a great deal of laughter as Fresh Ground is a humble guy who quickly credits others for his successful Leap Frog Cafe that provided trail magic to many hikers during the last several years.  Plans for the day changed bcause by the time we were done eating and talking there was almost no way we could hike in daylight to the otherise intended destination some 15 miles away. Instead we hiked about 4 miles where we arranged a pick-up by Bubba's Shuttles to take us to Big Walker Motel. Five of us (Fresh Ground, Blues Brother, Big Critter, Rambo, and me) are sharing a motel room. Some needed to get additional food for the next couple days. All of us enjoyed Dairy Queen and there are a few less horrible smelling hikers tonight.  Hiking again with Fresh Ground should be enjoyable in the coming days. With Internet access here, I got news that I feared. Subman and Suds announced today that they are leaving the AT for a while to fully recover. They intend to be away for a good period of time before deciding to resume their hike. Trail Chef is driving to Damascus to assist their trek home. I am confident I wouldn't be here without the kindness and comraderie they provided me. I am so grateful to them and appreciative of our time together. You never know what will happen out here and I hope we have more hiking miles ahead.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526130,"This morning's wake-up wasn't pretty. Despite our showers and doing some laundry, the room reeked with 5 of us in the motel room. Bubba shuttled us back to Laurel Creek. Blues Brother apparently had the best night's sleep and he took off up the trail followed by Rambo. Big Critter was next, leaving Fresh Ground and me. Fresh Ground and I hiked together all day at a reasonable pace. Today's destination didn't require pushing ourselves so we didn't. I am lucky to be hiking with this group. Fresh Ground wants to enjoy each day of his hike and is a very positive hiker. It was fun to again hear the ""last climb of the day"" phrase as we repeatedly came around a corner to confront yet another climb.We decided to stop to make a phone call or two. Mine was to my son, David, whose birthday is today. It was good to speak with him. He has a big week academically this week and sounds like he is prepared. Beth's Mom, Mimi, often says that David has a ""zest for life"" and I think she is correct. Beth and I are fortunate to have two wonderful children. I get a lift every time I speak with either of them and today was no exception. Happy Birthday David!Fresh Ground noticed a hitch in my step. It's my left knee. I think today's reasonable pace let it loosen up so that it went away after a couple hours but it is something I'll have to be more conscious of to make sure that I am not changing my stride and potentially creating a problem with an offsetting body part. Fresh Ground freely shares his life story and this sharing enables me to create a stronger bond with him. Our conversation effortlessly continued until we came to Big Critter's place for a break. A nice couple out for 2 days approached and Fresh Ground immediately offered them pieces of candy - an unusual practice out here given that every ounce of weight takes its toll. It is an example of how Fresh Ground brings smiles out. The smiles continue as we find ourselves pitted against each other in this year's Final Four. Fresh Ground from North Carolina raves about his team while I root for David's Villanova. There's a Duke grad within this couple and Big Critter is a big Duke fan. Please. I'm from Connecticut and we'll never get over Christian Laettner. A bet is made as to who buys dinner next week at Homeplace Restaurant, one of the AT's favorite all-you-can-eat dinner spots that I view as a prized AT destination. This new basketball topic propels us forward. Today's trail has its ups and downs but the terrain is primarily dirt-based and enables us to follow each other pretty closely so that the three of us can weave in and out of conversation. To our left are views of increasingly lush green valleys with homes and farms sprinkled in between.Water sources were hard to come by today and Fresh Ground finds another opportunity to get a piece of me when he asks if either of us has any extra water. I continue to carry more water than most hikers and he gets some of mine while bringing out another round of laughter. Jenny Knob Shelter approaches and the stories start to be exchanged between us and Blues Brother and Rambo, who walked together today. Subman sent me a nice message today and I'm smiling now thinking how lucky I am to have hiked and be hiking with such great people. Earlier in the day, ""Rusty"" Potts sent a nice message too and it was good to hear of his plans to return to the AT and a potential opportunity to see him again. Then there's the other message too. Messages from long-time friends and family and good wishes from my extended AT family created via trailjournals. Blues Brother said it best tonight - when you're out here this long, you have to really like to hike outdoors because each and every day you better be ready to hike over whatever terrain comes your way for some long hours. Blues said it right. Word came that Sooner Or Later plans to resume hiking on Monday after overcoming a cellulitis infection. Sooner's return is good news, but his challenge reminded all of us how lucky we are to be healthy and hiking.","Laurel Creek - VA 615 - Mile 583
",Jenny Knob Shelter,"Apr 02, Sat",18.80
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526361,"Wow. Last night's wind gusts were strong. Fresh Ground was in his hammock and thought a couple of times that his stakes would be uprooted. With the morning temperature of 28 degrees, our fingers became numb real fast as we quickly packed up to hike to get warm. Even then we didn't warm up until the first climb of the day. Our pace during the first 2 hours this morning was 3 miles per hour. That's what Subman calls a ""thru-hiker"" pace. A very fast pace for me and all the more a faster pace in that it was done on a descent climb followed by a long ridge line walk that required specific foot placement because of the continual stepping between rocks and boulders.Or maybe it was this morning's motivation - Trent's Grocery - where hot breakfast and desired drinks were eagerly anticipated. Trent's Grocery delivered. We all left there happy and full. Happier, in part, because Who-Dat joined us. Who-Dat became separated from us a day or so ago but he night hiked to Trent's Grocery, arriving there after 2:00 a.m. and hiking for 45 miles. Don't know how he does that except that he is extremely tough mentally and physically. Who-Dat was sore though so he put a bag of ice on his shins as we left Trent's, knowing that he'd hike and catch up to us by this day's end. Our elevation and weather changed within an hour after leaving Trent's. The terrain was flat, dirt trail and we were no longer fighting the gusty winds. Layers of clothing came off so that we wouldn't be dripping in sweat. Dismal Falls was the second side-trip of the day, a .3 blue-blaze trail (Trent's Grocery was 1 mile off trail round trip and worth every step.) Dismal Falls was gorgeous and provided opportunities to enjoy the falling water from above and below. Too bad the water was so cold because Dismal Falls clearly has swimming opportunities below the falls, complete with multiple stone slabs to dry off in the sun. No swimming today though. Blues Brother, Rambo, Fresh Ground, and I enjoyed our time and easily could've spent the rest of the day there had we so chosen. The trail after Dismal Falls was as easy as we've experienced on the AT. The trail closely followed streams that ultimately led to Dismal Falls. More flat trail with hardly any ups and downs of any kind. The four of us were moving quickly until we came upon Big Criiter, who has hiked solo ahead of us. Big Critter had a bad look on his face, clearly disheartened. Big Critter had foot surgery months before starting the AT. He'd previously sprained his ankle on that foot and now had injured it again. He and I hiked at a very slow pace. My intent was to talk with him as we hiked to get his mind off of his painful foot but I failed and couldn't sustain conversation for long periods of time, with me thinking that Big Critter was wondering whether repeated foot injuries were about to end his hike. After just hearing about Sooner Or Later's medical challenge, I found myself dipping into similar thoughts of just how quickly this hike can be jeopardized.Fresh Ground, Big Critter, and I stopped for prolonged lunch at Wapiti Shelter. We did this intentionally to give Big Critter time to prepare himself for the rest of the day's hike. There were no pick-up options and he needed to finish hiking another 7 miles, including a substantial climb. Wapiti gave us plenty to talk about though. This shelter is one of two on the trail that are known for brutality. I can't remember exactly but there was at least one hiker murdered here and then another was almost murdered here years later. Not good thoughts to say the least and eventually we agreed that we needed to begin moving at a 1 mile per hour pace so that Big Critter and us would end today's hike in daylight. Fresh Ground fetched water and was behind us so I carried the conversation with more about some highlights of my life. Big Critter is young, 23 years old, and he'd met Beth at Woodchuck Hostel. He is an inquisitive guy, very interested in speaking with hikers about their lives and sharing his too. He and I had already hiked as a pair for a few hours earlier in the week so we'd already covered basic family and work topics. Conversation went to new places with Big Critter seeming to enjoy my telling stories of my GrandDad and my Grandma. I got choked up and admitted that tears were welling up as I went on about GrandDad, one of the finest people I've ever known and someone who I wished I'd spent even more time with. A highlight of my life was GrandDad joining me for a car ride from his home in Coraopolis, PA to LaGrange, IL to surprise my Mom as GrandDad walked in the door to join our family for Thanksgiving. I was smiling a lot telling Big Critter about Grandma too - her stubbornness and dislike for medical treatment and those incredible chocolate chip cookies that she always had ready to eat upon my arrival. Lost in this conversation for a while, because time is available out here to have talks of any duration, the climb began to come to an end. We caught a great view on a ledge around mile 619. Big Criiter said his foot was holding its own and we started counting down the remaining miles. The banter turned playful as Fresh Ground and I exchanged barbs - Fresh Ground always wins, but I occasionally get in a good shot. I veered off with a couple miles to go to get a view up another blue-blaze trail. The last couple miles today were like the first of the day, now needing to be taken slowly because tired hikers tend to trip on such rocks without a morning's fresh legs. Rambo gave me my biggest scare of the trip as he somehow managed to hike behind me and then yell out my name just 20 yards behind me. Even he wondered if I was going to fall on my face after being so startled. The day's hike ended today finding Fresh Ground, Big Critter, me, and the young lady I spoke inappropriately to a few days ago. We were at Woods Hole Hostel, a hostel with a great reputation run lovingly by Neville and her husband Michael. Who-Dat came ambling in soon after we got there. A bit awkward to say the least. But the young lady was more than kind and conversation ensued as if we were meeting for the first time, probably because she was meeting Fresh Ground and Big Critter for the first time. When she and I were briefly by ourselves I began to apologize and she cut me off. She said she'd read the note I'd left below her door. She thanked me for it and said she completely forgave me and to never give it another thought. Such kindness. The evening was spent around a great fire Who-Dat started and then we were informed that the food requested of Neville was ready - fresh baked bread, smoothies, and home-made ice cream. This hostel has been here for decades and is as beautifully maintained as any home I've ever been in. It's warmth is incredible and consistent with Neville, who joined us as she ate her dinner. Fresh Ground and Neville know each other from prior years when Fresh Ground was feeding hikers with his Leap-Frog Cafe. The rest of us got to hear the conversation about hikers who have come through here in the past and about the beginning and history of Woods Hole Hostel.What a day. So many unique parts within it - each so special.","Jenny Knob Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526488,"Another great day. A meal at Woods Hole Hostel is a treat not to be missed. Woods Hole Hostel is not to be missed from my perspective. Each hostel is unique and Woods Hole Hostel is a special one. It's owners, Neville & Michael, have created beautiful surroundings for all to share and enjoy. The sharing includes eating snacks or meals with them. Breakfast began with holding hands and sharing your name, home location, and expressing what you are grateful for. The exchanged grace sets the tone and the delicious food is thoroughly enjoyed as Neville explains what is being served and where it originated from. Subman told me about this special place and I'm glad he did.Fresh Ground and I hiked out leisurely since today was a somewhat short hike to Pearisburg where we intend to keep our eyelids open long enough to watch the Villanova vs. North Carolina men's basketball championship game tonight. Big Critter will be driven to Pearisburg to watch the game with us. Who-Dat intends to take one or more zero days in order to overcome the agony in his shins. Blues Brother and Rambo stayed in a shelter a few miles past me last night but will join us in Pearisburg. Hiking without the stress of a big mileage day made for a light-hearted feel to the hike. Fresh Ground and I took a packs off break and enjoyed a view of the valley at Mile 631.6. The descent down to Pearisburg seemed long as we dropped 1900 feet over almost 3 miles. We stopped counting the number of switchbacks after counting more than twenty. The weather was sunny and a great temperature for hiking. We were almost done when the day took an odd turn. I stopped and told Fresh Ground to hold up. Just a few feet in front of me was a red squirrel perched squarely in the center of the trail. It seemed that this squirrel was acting like a troll, intent to not let us pass. Fresh Ground was concerned about how strangely this squirrel was acting. Fresh Ground moved quickly off the trail to escape this squirrel's stare. I moved much slower and just took a small step to the side. The squirrel squared up on me again, looking like it was preparing to launch. I told Fresh Ground I thought I was in trouble. Honestly, I pulled my hiking poles together to defend myself. Fortunately the squirrel took up a nearby tree as I followed Fresh Ground off trail. I know, I can't even stand up to a squirrel - what will happen with a snake or a bear?The switchbacks continued and then the trail started to take us up. It didn't make sense but that's what happened. Then the day took another incredible turn. The day's hike down to Pearisburg was done but we no longer had a perspective of where Pearisburg was. So Fresh Ground called out to a woman in the parking lot, asking about Pearisburg. She pointed the direction and said she could drive us into town and then she asked ""Are you Fresh Ground?"" Incredible. How does this keep happening? The woman was Kid's mother, who had driven from Pennsylvania to give her thru-hiking son, Kid, some trail magic en route to a work location tomorrow. Cari, Kid's mom, then yelled up to the mountain side behind her and soon Kid was seen coming down to join us. Cari and Kid had somehow envisioned that Fresh Ground would be passing by today and Cari came with food and drink. Introductions were made. Fresh Ground had hiked out of Damascus and hiked with Kid and a couple other thru-hikers last week. People knowing who Fresh Ground is has increasingly become the norm but for it to have happened as we emerged from the woods just seemed beyond anything imaginable. But what a great time and a nice reunion for Kid and Fresh Ground.With six of us at the same motel, the mood was a bit festive. Food and drink without being exhausted feels pretty good. Last Chance and Seeker were here too. Fresh Ground created several plates of food to share. We all enjoyed each other's company.Near the end of the night Fresh Ground and I acknowledged today's laughter. I am hiking with a great group of hikers who enjoy being with each other. Nova just won. Great game and great day. We're resupplied and heading out for a few days of troublesome weather.","Sugar Run Gap - Woods Hole Hostel

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526593,"They say that after hiking the AT that you remember the good times. The memory of this day will be a ""good time"" but not because of the weather. Fresh Ground and I started hiking before sunrise. It was freezing cold outside but it often is that cold at that time. We had a .9 mile walk to get back to the AT that was memorable for how cold it was and how the wind was ferociously gusting. I was foolishly hiking in shorts and my long sleeve blue shirt - my typical hiking clothes. As Julia Roberts says in ""Pretty Woman"" - ""Big mistake! Huge mistake!"" With the temperature below 30 and the wind slamming us, we were both experiencing numb hands and faces. The climb up to Rice Field Shelter got us warm until we stopped at Rice Field Shelter. There the temperature was 24 degrees and the wind was blowing hard. Blues Brother and Rambo caught up to us as Fresh Ground and I were taking a lunch break in a sunny orchard in the sun. The four of us hiked together to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter where we saw Last Chance and Seeker, who we had just met the night before. Last Chance and Seeker were hiking on to The Captain's. I chose to hike there too since the Captain provides wifi, electricity, free soda, and tenting on his beautiful flat lawn. We briefly met the Captain has been providing this trail magic for 12 years. I am very glad to have met the Captain and recommend tenting here if you are in this area. Last Chance, Seeker, and I were able to get to know each other better over dinner. They are really nice guys. Last Chance will be completing his thru-hike in Haroers Ferry so he's close to finishing. The temperature is forecasted to get down to 24 tonight so it is going to be a cold one. I won't be wearing shorts in the morning.","Pearisburg
",Captain's,"Apr 05, Tue",20.20
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526759,"Today's hike whooped my butt. I don't recall being as tired after a hike than I was after today's hike. The hike began and ended in near darkness. I woke up last night seeing twinkles from my tent, except that they turned out to be frosted twinkles inside my tent from condensation. After collapsing my tent, there was enough snow accumulated from within my tent to make a descent size snowball. I had to wipe down the condensation in my tent and on my down sleeping quilt as best as I could in order to remove the moisture that would be heavy on my back and break down my gear.After stowing my tent and gear, I went to the Captain's zip line set up to shuttle hikers to and from the AT to the Captain's beautiful yard. You can imagine the relief I felt a after my successful zip line crossing over the stream that separates the AT from the Captain's yard. The last thing I wanted to do was to call for help if I had gotten myself stuck mid-stream. The Captain's zip line contains a swing-like seat for me and a carabiner above for my loaded backpack. The push-off from one side doesn't get you completely over to the other side but another rope is available to pull the passenger to the other side. The zip line is fun, as is tenting on the Captain's property.  Fresh Ground came from the prior shelter to pick me up on his way. We began hiking together around 7:15 and pretty quickly came to the blown down tree shown in the picture. Fresh Ground was good enough to hold that position long enough for me to take his picture after I threatened to push him back under the tree if he moved before the picture was taken. So the laughter today began early - so early that the discussion around the darkened picnic table used to prepare tonight's meals resulted in a number of comments that all contained how incredible it seemed that certain aspects of the AT had been undertaken during today's hike. Today's hike contained a significant descent before an 1800 foot climb. This is nothing we haven't done before except that this descent and climb seemed to contain endless rocks of all sizes. Rocks really slow down our pace as we have to pick our way through the trail. I came off one such rock while eating some Ritz crackers. Leaves covered the trail where I planted my left foot and I took a perfect slide on my butt for a few feet down the mountain's side. Fresh Ground witnessed the fall and kept laughing as I continually asked for his call as the ump. I wanted to know if I was ""safe""' or ""out"" with my fictitious slide into home plate. Blues Brother and Rambo caught up to Fresh Ground and me just after I got up so the whole scene was explained in detail. The Kid told us later that he too had fallen there. This was my fifth fall of this hike and it was clearly my favorite. The last fall from a few days ago wasn't anywhere near as much fun because my right shin crashed into a rock and I'm still displaying that bloody bruise. The four of us (Blues Brother, Rambo, Fresh Ground, and me) hiked together for a while sharing our challenges as we hiked today's trail. The banter between us just goes on and on. I was remembered of this banter at the end of today's hike after two new hikers were introduced to us as we lumbered in to tonight's shelter after they were already in their sleeping bags for the night. Giggles and Tigger (this one being female and the second Tigger thru-hiking) said they were amused by our banter as we unloaded our gear to prepare to eat and sleep. This was the longest hike for each of us and the Kid called me out after I said that today's hike enabled us to consider hiking 22 miles tomorrow to get to Four Pines Hostel, from which Eddie at the hostel will shuttle us to Homeplace Restaurant for that delicious all-you-can-eat meal I've been hungry for the last couple days.We almost stopped at shelter 7 miles before this one. It was a tough call pushing out of that shelter just before 5:00 and knowing that some of us wouldn't arrive until just before darkness. We all made it though and the final climb of 800 feet, that seemed to mostly be a vertical climb with few switchbacks, took everything out of us just as we had expected. Also, as expected, we enjoyed hiking through open pastures for a few miles. This pasture hiking was a visual treat and I was glad those 3 cows could only look at me from the other side of the fence that separated us. Today whooped my butt. Tomorrow may whoop my butt too - but that's okay.","Captain's

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526891,"You know the saying about being careful about what you ask for? That saying applies to me today. I've been pushing and our hiking bubble has been doing pretty big miles. When we left Pearisburg, we carried food for 3.5 days but I said we may be able to reach Four Pines Hostel in 3 days. We got to Four Pines Hostel in 3 days. Having done it, I'd never do it again as a 2 mile per hour average hiker. The hike from Pearisburg requires too many hours of difficult hiking to be easily done by a 2 mile per hour hiker.Fresh Ground and I began hiking at first light while Blues Brother, Rambo, and the Kid started hiking at 9:30. We all ate at Homeplace Restaurant - something I highly recommend. My energy was bad all day because I failed to eat a complete dinner the night before. I don't intend on making that mistake again. Weather today was all over the place. Sunny at times with at least 2 hail showers. Fresh Ground and I saw an ugly looking set of clouds approaching us just 30 minutes before we summited Cove Mountain to reach Dragon's Tooth. This was the first time during this hike that we hastily put on rain gear as we feared we were about to be drenched. The storm passed with little fanfare - luckilyDragon's Tooth is a highly touted attraction on the AT and rightly so. The climb from the north to Dragon's Tooth features climbing over and between tall rocks that seem like scaling the back of a dragon if you let your imagination run a bit. It's a lot of fun, but is tiring too. At the top of that climb is a blue-blaze trail that takes hikers to the a vertical rock that seems to just jut upward for many yards to form the dragon's tooth. Hikers like me that are afraid of ledges can't hike such a vertical challenge. When David (my son) and I hiked this last year, David went to the very top of the tooth and stretched his arms as he stood on its narrow crest that seems to be just a 4 foot ledge - way too risky for me as I was afraid just looking at him do it. The climb after Dragon's Tooth is hard too.The climb up Brush Mountain required energy but it was admittedly a nicely graded climb with numerous switchbacks. Whoever created that climb did a masterful job. Another highlight today was the Audie Murphy Memorial. Audie Murphy is a World War II hero whose plane crashed nearby. The memorial features an American flag, a commemorative stone, and many tributes left by veterans paying their respects. The memorial is quite moving emotionally. Thanks to all veterans reading this journal. I am lucky to be hiking with many veterans this year and am so happy to have hiked the short blue-blaze trail to pay tribute to this hero.Four Pines Hostel was full tonight with many hikers I've met before - Booty, Candle Maker, Marathon - and many hikers I've heard stories about. We apparently have caught up to some faster hikers who will put distance between us beginning tomorrow morning. It was good to meet and speak with these hikers. Candle Maker was Big Critter's hiking companion for most of Critters' hike and he told us what we feared - Big Critter's hike is over because of his foot problems. Too bad for all of us because Big Critter is a great young guy who was a pleasure to hike with.Hiking this far on the AT isn't easy. I was reminded again about this with tonight's news about Big Critter. Some of these hikers have done a great job maintaining their weight. I am not one of them and I clearly need to improve my nutrition on the trail and become less reliant on resupply stops like today's delicious meal at Homeplace Reataurant. That's my wish as I drift back to sleep tonight.","Sarver Hollow Shelter
",VA 624 - Four Pines Hostel,"Apr 07, Thu",22.80
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527190,"Didn't see this coming. I knew it would be a big day because today's hike includes two of Virginia's famed triple crown - McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. The third part of the triple crown was Dragon's Tooth that was included in yesterday's hike.Fresh Ground and I left Four Pines Hostel before anybody else was up. In order to hike the miles we've been hiking we need to get an early start. Leaving quietly was harder than usual because there were approximately a dozen hikers sleeping in the hostel. The red light feature of our head lamps came in handy and I don't think we woke anyone up. Fresh Ground's plan for his hike was to hike to Harper's Ferry, go home to work a bit and hike with his family, and then continue his hike by way of Mt. Katahdin in Maine and hike south to Harper's Ferry. This morning Fresh Ground seemed pretty certain that his plan was changing and that he'd head home in a couple of days. So it was time to enjoy a few more miles hiking together. Early in today's hike came a personal highlight. Fresh Ground had already heard my story of the ""Cows of Catawba"" a couple of times but he patiently let me retell it again as we hiked its location. David, my son, and I had hiked today's hike last year. There's a photo titled ""Cows of Catawba Hill"" - that's the name I've given to this mound of pasture. Last year, David hiked ahead of me and informed me that we had a problem ahead of us. Two large cows were straddling the AT at the top of the hill. The cows began to pay attention to us so we backed away out of their sight. David wanted to hike around them by going left - but a fence prevented the route to the immediate left and there were more cows behind the trees to our left so that course didn't seem to work. To our right was an open field that sloped below the cows on the top of the hill. David didn't like that option given that we'd be exposed to the cows. Darkness wasn't imminent but we also had a hike of unknown territory so there wasn't a lot of time to figure out what to do. I insisted that we hike down the slope and then across the field after which we'd hike up the hip until we returned to the AT. David didn't like the plan but he followed me down the hill. On the way to the bottom, David told me to look back up the hill. The ""Walk In The Woods"" movie with Robert Redford and Nick Nolte was opening the coming weekend and I'd tell David within the hour that the scene we'd just experienced would probably be better than anything in the movie. Looking over my shoulder what I saw first was a bright setting sun that formed a perfect background to silhouette not two cows but a line of eight cows or more standing next to each other in perfect formation. I swear they looked like a line of gunfighters from any number of old western movies. We kept walking, me literally to find some form of cover or option to take cover. I feared they were coming our way. The cows stayed up on the hill. It was too late for a picture by the time we hiked around them and got to a fence that separated them from us. Numerous hikers that David and I spoke with during that 2-day hike told of their encounters with bears. I had to confess being scared by cows. The memory of last year was refreshed by visiting its scene. Fresh Ground had been patient but as I kept taking pictures, I noticed that he had hiked a good distance ahead of me and was moving quickly.I quickly abandoned my attempt to catch up with Fresh Ground because he was moving so fast. It was a bit frustrating but became even more frustrating as I encountered leaf piles over my ankles that covered the trail. The leaves covered rocks and roots so stumbling became my norm. That's a slow way to hike and became slower as I fell to my knees twice in 10 yards. The falls weren't painful except for my pride and wondering if I'd ever catch Fresh Ground today. Coming down the hill to VA 311, I heard Fresh Ground before I saw him. He was coming out of or around a car. The car was Signage's car. Signage was the hiker Beth and I met mid-February as she began her thru-hike. I was warmly greeted with a couple Orange Crush sodas - great trail magic for me. The news was unexpected. Signage had offered to drive Fresh Ground to his mother's home two hours away. It was an ideal scenario for Fresh Ground - all I could be was be genuinely happy for him since this was pure trail magic. After a few pictures it was time to go. I've been very lucky to hike with Fresh Ground. I think I'd better write down my Top 10 Fresh Ground highlights before I forget them. Smiles were on our faces as easily as the laughter routinely erupted between us. McAfee Knob was 3.9 miles ahead. McAfee Knob is often referred to as the most photographed spot on the AT. Everyone is captivated by the views and the opportunity to get to its edge - depending on each person's level of comfort with ledges and fear of heights. I arrived and had McAfee Knob all to myself. I was there on a gorgeous clear day. Except nobody was here to take my photo. I enjoyed lunch at this unique spot, continually looking at those views. A couple arrived and I immediately agreed to take their pictures if they'd take mine. Soon Candle Maker and then Marathon arrived and I took their pictures too.  It was on the way to Tinker Cliffs that I realized I might be able to hike to Daleville and avoid really cold weather forecasted for the next couple days. So I was annoyed when the trail somehow was not where expected it to be. Eventually the trail was found and then I followed it back to where I'd gotten off track. Silly to some, but I'm a self-identified ""purist"" with the intent of hiking the entire AT and not skipping any sections, no matter how small. As Candle Maker passed me, he shared the same experience of initially finding himself off trail.  Tinker Cliffs is an extended cliff walk that provides views back to McAfee Knob and beyond in addition to views to the north. Landmarks of the AT and I was fortunate to have hiked by on a clear day, but it was windy - very windy. The gusting winds created really cold conditions. I was pretty certain I wanted to hike another long day to escape the cold.  I yelled to Candle Maker as I was going by Lamberts Meadow Shelter, the shelter David and I had camped at last year. I was going for Daleville. It was after 4:00 meaning that hiking another 9.4 miles would probably require some night hiking. I was motivated though. As I left, I asked if Candle Maker was confused by the appearance of a set of white blazes that seemed to be an extra set more than a half mile before Lamberts shelter. Again, Candle Maker's experience was consistent with mine. I kind of needed that reassurance because I definitely didn't want to get lost, especially if getting lost would result in more night hiking.  I began to monitor my pace and progress. At 7:00 I was frustrated with my progress. I was still climbing on a ridge, sometimes having awkward steps between boulders that I couldn't imagine being able to safely hike in darkness. Fortunately, the trail became the downward descent I was anxiously awaiting. The final half hour or so was easy hiking with clearly defined trail - no leaves or boulders impeding my progress. I emerged from the trail in darkness but didn't turn on my light because the trail was so clearly defined.     I was lucky to get to Daleville tonight. I really was tired but had pulled it off. I celebrated with an Orange Crush purchased at the first gas station located very close to the trail. The cashier told me a second soda could be purchased for just another dollar. So there were two Orange Crush sodas just like Signage have me many hours earlier. And a smile came to me as Fresh Ground and I exchanged messages. He was happy to be in his mother's home and I was happy to be in Daleville, not knowing if we'd ever hike together again but knowing that when we had hiked together that we'd had a great time.","VA 624 - Four Pines Hostel

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527313,"Did I tell you that Beth (my wonderful wife of almost 37 years) was arriving today for her 2nd visit on the AT? Beth arrived around 9:30 a.m. and immediately helped with my town chores. Having a car to easily get to the grocery store, a restaurant, and the outfitter store was really helpful. I had her bring non-hiking clothes too and immediately noticed a difference in my pants. Our scale from home revealed that I've continued to lose weight for a total loss now of 16 pounds. Beth said she really noticed how skinny I've gotten. I am sure this weight loss is due to hiking more miles per day recently combined with my not eating enough on hiking days. Fresh Ground and Blues Brother have each told me to eat more and they are clearly right. Candle Maker and Marathon have lost zero and 3 or 4 pounds respectively and told me how much they eat. I'll carry more food when I leave Daleville to try to stop or slow down the weight loss. Beth caught me taking a nap after lunch. It didn't last long but was very refreshing. Beth brought supplies with her so that simplified loading my backpack for the next several days. Beth also brought a new Sawyer Water Filtration System because I mistakenly left the water filter in my backpack overnight on a night that could've resulted in a frozen filter. If frozen, then the filter won't do its job and could lead to my getting giardia or some other water borne illness. I'll be more comfortable obtaining water now. Usually I sleep with the water filter secured between the vest I sleep in and the down jacket that I sleep in over the vest. Fresh Ground called today so we had a few laughs. He's pretty happy with yesterday's decision and is quite excited about working a couple weeks to make money to purchase some ultra light gear. Blues Brother and I traded messages in the evening. Blues Brother, Rambo, and Booty were still at Four Pines Hostel to intentionally avoid this late round of very cold weather. From what I can tell many thru-hikers stayed off the AT during this very cold day that was combined with strong winds. I ordered a new pair of trailrunners from Outdoor 76 because the pair I am wearing are pretty worn through in the soles. It is common for thru-hikers to go through 3 or more pairs of shoes as the terrain and virtual non-stop wearing of them break them down. Outdoor 76 said the wind chill temperature on Albert Mountain was forecasted to be near zero tonight.With Blues Brother about 25 miles behind me and Beth already here it was an easy decision to take a Robert Parrish (double zero) so tomorrow will continue this period of rest and revisiting what gear will leave Daleville with me Monday morning.","Daleville - US 220 - Howard Johnson Express

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527339,"Great day for hiking today - but not for me. Beth and I enjoyed a great breakfast at the Holiday Inn Express. We then drove to the McAfee Knob parking lot where we began to hike to this famous AT picture spot and its fabulous view. Beth was concerned about me not resting today but I couldn't let this opportunity pass. I wanted her to have the chance to dangle her feet over the ledge like so many others do. Hiking slows everything down and it let us really get caught up. As Beth said ""We have the time."" That is one of the real pleasures of hiking - you have the time to think and talk about whatever you want.Once at McAfee Knob, I was the first to dangle my feet. I asked Beth to join me and today's picture shows she came over. Other photos show how comfortable Beth got. It's fun to people watch here in order to see how daring some people are. The tendency is to hike to places like this and then quickly leave. A nice couple from Pennsylvania came up with their daughter who will soon graduate from Roanoke College. She will join the Peace Corps in August, serving in Peru. I absolutely love how easily strangers come together in places like this and talk comfortably as they've known each other for years. The conversation extended our time at McAfee Knob and I was grateful for those extra moments to take in the views and share information about ourselves, our enjoyment of the outdoors, and the possibilities in the coming years.  I was surprised that we hadn't seen any thru-hikers while we were at the top but that changed when during our hike back we saw Blues Brother coming our way. I had carried a few goodies and Blues Brother seemed very happy to get a Glacier Gatorade. Rambo and Last Chance arrived a few minutes later, enabling me to introduce Beth to them. They seemed to like the grapes the best. Treats you don't have to carry perk me up and I think they walked away with renewed vigor. We exchanged hiking plans and how much food they were carrying. No question our paths will intersect tomorrow or a couple days after that. Seeker was the last thru-hiker to be seen today and he appreciated the last Peppermint Patty. Homeplace Restaurant was the final destination today. Wanted Beth to enjoy their great food and to then understand why I love to eat there so much. Beth quickly understood. We left with our bellies full.I am lucky Beth was able to share these places and these days with me. My AT hike is all about hiking passed every white blaze but includes great days like these too. As Gangsta routinely said in her trailjournal entries ""This will just be a memory one day."" A great memory.","Daleville - US 220 - Holiday Inn Express

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527530,"""So are you excited to start hiking again?"" Beth asked me that question shortly before my hike began today. Ouch. The answer was ""No. I'm not excited."" I knew why she was asking. I didn't have anyone to hike with today. Fresh Ground was home. Blues Brother, Rambo, Last Chance, and Seeker were probably 10 miles behind at today's start. Saying goodbye to Beth was easier today - probably because we're getting used to this, if you ever ""get used to this."" With my poles digging in, I moved quickly across US 220 in order to not get run over by a car. I looked over my shoulder after entering the trail into the woods and saw Beth taking a picture from the car. One final wave. It reminded me of countless times my two children waved goodbye as I headed off to work on a weekend many years ago - can't say that I liked that memory but that memory came into my mind.The trail between Daleville and Troutville is maintained by someone who is maintaining their back yard. The grass around the trail was just cut with a lawn mower. Thanks to whoever did this because it made for a nice start to the day.The trail took me through a fence stile and then up a hill. That's what I saw in today's picture. I picked up my hiking poles to not draw the cow's attention anymore than it seeing me as I approached. No fence separated us and as I hiked I saw many more cows grazing around me. At the hill's top was a post with a double blaze. A double blaze alerts hikers that the trail is turning. A cow was a few feet away from that post, denying my hiking there. I went wide left and then returned to where I thought the trail would be. More cows came into view. No sign of a white blaze or a path. After what seemed like a long time but probably was less than 10 minutes, I realized I had to get another look at that double blazed post. Fortunately the cow was gone and I then saw a couple white blazes down another side of the hill. Back in track with none of the cows doing anything beyond looking at me and then returning to their grazing. I left this pasture knowing I liked Troutville cows more than Catawba cows. With a few miles behind me, I began to find my rhythm hiking. And then I remembered what it was like to hike alone. It was then that I really realized how long it had been since feeling like this. While hiking with other hikers, we often hike with separately with substantial distances between us but there's an awareness of the ofher hikers being ahead or behind. Not so today. My late start today combined with my wasting time searching for the trail around the grazing cows pretty much solidified that I'd hike just to the shelter 18.5 miles away so I never attempted to hike faster than a normal stride of 2 miles per hour.  So why am I not excited to be hiking? What does this mean? When did this change happen? Those questions needed answers as the trail went up and down and around numerous corners. The initial climb was graded nicely making for a nice hike that didn't require thought to keep climb. My thinking seemed scrambled with various perspectives. Eventually a thread of consistency and awareness surfaced. Layers of memories in the form of people and places came to mind. Having hiked 700+ miles, the excitement of those initial days has been replaced by the fact that hiking is what I do now. Blues Brother has often said something about how we have to get up and hike every day. He and Fresh Ground repeatedly pointed out that the length and vertical aspect of the next mountain's climb iis nothing we haven't already climbed - so just get on with this one too. After that thought solidified came more memories and more appreciation for this first part of hiking the AT. If you've read this journal - and thanks to all who are doing that and enjoying this hike with me - then you too can surely fill in the blanks with the new friends I've made out here hiking. Think about all those I've had moments with. All those amazing places I've seen. Excitement apparently isn't there now, but it feels good to be here. This thinking gave me peace with Beth's question. I then found myself yearning for the coming days and weeks. Who will be next? What is around the next corner? A quick wildlife update. Prompted by my being startled as I nearly stuck my right hiking pole into a 3' - 4' black snake today. Yesterday, I gave some candy to a couple section hiking for a few days. As we spoke I recalled seeing them around a shelter on Friday. They remembered seeing me too as I was one of two hikers they'd seen out here. Earlier that day they had seen three bear cubs playing up on the side of the mountain we had all passed. So the bears are up and out now. Deer are being seen more frequently. A few days ago Blues Brother, Rambo, Fesh Ground, and I got to see 3 white-tailed deer scamper away with ease. According to several hikers, salamanders are apparently out everywhere - maybe I'm making too much noise with my hiking poles.    Awareness of my shadow returned today, bring a smile to my face. Bean, a female flip-flop hiker who began her thru-hike in Front Royal at the northern end of Shenandoah National Park, is hoping her trail legs will come in soon. She seemed to be a strong hiker already. Otis, who began hiking in January, joined me in this shelter around 7:00. We'd met at Four Pines Hostel. Otis is best known as the hiker who bear a rabid skunk to death when the skunk kept confronting he and a fellow hiker as they tented. He still feels bad about it but realizes other options weren't available. I had a nice elongated conversation with a couple at Taylor Mountain Overlook. They had plenty of questions and said that I look to clean to be a thru-hiker; was glad Blues Brother and Fresh Ground were not around to hear that in order to avoid the teasing that would've been relentless. Got a message from a friend from sunny Florida today. More memories of great times spent in earlier days. All of your messages are appreciated more than you can imagine. Someone recently asked how much time these entries take. I'm a slow typer on this phone so this one took about 1.5 hours. I think I'm tired enough now to fall asleep again so that's what I'm going to do now. I am so lucky to be here experiencing this trail.","Daleville - US 220 - Holiday Inn Express

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527756,"Today's forecast called for a rainy day but barely a drop came down all day. Within minutes after saying goodbye to Otis, I was so warm that I had to stop to put away my windshirt so that I could hike in just a t-shirt and shorts. Rustling leaves were frequently heard today. It took a few times but then I got my first looks at the salamanders Otis mentioned. Can't say that they were pretty. I expected to see orange salamanders like those seen in prior year's journal pictures but the ones I saw were faded gray. Pretty is appropriate though to describe the many flowers seen periodically lining sides of the trail. More small flowers were seen today than in any previous days. More bees, moths, and insects were out too. Gnats were not a problem except for a brief moment but they served as a reminder that I soon need to start carrying a bug net and spray.The sun came out flexing its muscle with considerable heat today. Shade provided welcome relief as did the cooling wind obtained after climbing to the ridge's top. Subtle changes of temperature and sights were the order of the day because there were no other hikers or motorists stopping by at designated viewing spots where the trail and roads intersected. The first and only person seen today was Mule, a section hiker that has been hiking the last 10 days. I didn't see him until 4:00. He was a Notre Dame alum which will be of particular interest to one of my good friends. So where were all the other hikers today? Candle Maker is two days ahead according to the shelter log books that he faithfully signs. Giggles, who I met in a shelter before Daleville, is one day ahead. Exchanged messages with Blues Brother and learned that he is headed to his sister's home. Sounds like his knee can use a few days rest. I just finalized plans with Beth tonight to get to Texas in May so it's possible that Blues Brother and I will find ourselves back together again then - assuming I am fortunate enough to remain injury free. Blues shared news that Medic and Speedy sustained injuries and are off the trail for good. I was expecting those fast, young hikers to be passing me by any day now. It seems that many of my past hiking companions have fallen on hard times - but then I remembered seeing the great news that Subman and Suds were back on the trail. After tonight's call to Beth, I got to briefly exchange messages with Spirit of 76. Spirit intends to enjoy for a few days the warmth and good food at Woods Hole Hostel. It was great to hear from her. Rambo is about 10 miles behind me and I suspect Last Chance and Seeker are there too. I have the shelter all to myself tonight. That's a first. It will enable me to set an alarm so that I can start hiking early tomorrow. Tomorrow's hike includes passing a Federal Aviation Tower that I saw as I was hiking Fresh Ground's ""last climb of day"", a beaut consisting of almost 2300'. That tower seemed to be very far away. I found myself thinking a lot today about the upcoming weeks. I had to do that in order to purchase airplane tickets and guesstimate where I might be by then. Given my many hiker friends whose hikes have recently been permanently or temporarily halted, it didn't go unnoticed how fortunate I have been to have not sustained an injury.   Hiking this trail requires hard work and some good luck. That was one of many small, but important, takeaways realized today.","Bobblets Gap Shelter
",Cornelius Creek Shelter ,"Apr 12, Tue",18.40
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527833,"Hiker Hostel's Patrice said something like ""Don't worry about the things you worry about."" Just yesterday I barely saw anyone and then last night Spirit of 76 and I started to get caught up via messaging after weeks of not being in contact with each other. Then Bruce from Richmond to get proposed having dinner in a few days to discuss his upcoming thru-hike. There's a saying that the trail provides and that seems to be the case if anyone was concerned about me hiking solo yesterday. I've always loved waterfalls. It probably began when I was very young and routinely visited Niagara Falls where my Dad's parents lived. The Apple Orchard Waterfall was 1.1 miles off the AT though and given that I hoped to hike more than 20 AT mikes today such a side trip would probably cost me in terms of time and energy. But Spirit of 76's message this morning encouraged me to enjoy the magnificence and seeing a 200' waterfall is something special, so off I went. ""Off"" being the important word. The trail to Apple Orchard Waterall was steep. Beth and I laugh whenever we get lost driving somewhere. We say we'd be terrible contestants on The Amazing Race. Well, it appears I can follow the AT's white blazes most of the time, but it appears I struggle off the AT. I missed the turn in the photo shown for today. The sign was clearly marked. I just interpreted it as indicating something other than what it meant and so I hiked a distance up a fire road before turning around and finally getting on the trail to the waterfall. The waterfall was okay, but not great. I am glad I went out of my way to see it, but want anyone hiking the AT to understand that the trail is difficult even if you stay on the waterfall's trail. This excursion took 2 hours instead of the one hour I'd expected and it was a pretty tiring 2 hours too. Mentally and physically, the rest of the day was spent trying to ensure that I got to this day's destination. I finished hiking about 45 minutes before sunset. Here in the shelter tonight are Kid and his hiking partners - Padiwan and Pork Roll, Bookworm - a fast hiker intending to finish the AT in 4 months, and Rambo, who arrived more than an hour after sunset. I met and spoke with a couple flip-flop thru-hikers today. Their trail names are Old Growth and Dysfengshuinal. Both started somewhat recently and are waiting for their trail legs to kick in. Trail legs is the term used to describe a hiker's physical ability to do many more miles per day than they were able to do when they started. It usually takes a few weeks for a hiker to get their trail legs. It seems I got my trail legs when I routinely became able to hike more than 15 miles per day. Now, when I do 20+ mile days, it is really due to my hiking very long hours. I notice that the strong, young hikers seem to be able to find a hiking pace that enables them to hike 25 or more miles per day without hiking my extra hours (read that as I am a slow hiker.)A few of you have commented about how the title of each day's journal entry is a song. Almost all of those songs are on my playlist and those that aren't are ones that will be added when I get time to download them. When preparing for this hike, I thought using song titles as a way to describe my day would be a fun exercise and I have enjoyed doing it. Sometimes I lock in a song title pretty early in the day as it seems unshakably indicative of that day, while on other days l mull over several songs to determine which captures the tone of my day the best. I'm always searching for a way to use some of my all-time favorites and am happy when that comes together. Specific to Andy's question - No, I don't sing them out loud. I wouldn't want to soil this beautiful trail with my inability to carry a tune. I do enjoy playing that song in my head though. Some songs seem appropriate to be used many times out here but I am trying to find a new song for each day. What can I say - it seems to work for me and bring a smile to my face while hiking the magnificence Spirit of 76 spoke of.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528004,"I don't know what happened today. I hit a wall at 11:00, right after completing climbs of approximately 1900' and 800'. The trail provided many switchbacks and didn't contain rocks or boulders. My pack was as light as it has ever been because I'd eaten almost all my food as we headed in to resupply at the end of the day. I had actually found myself thinking how good I felt after the 1900' climb. And I was fine after the 800' climb too for the perspective of getting through it. The hikers I sheltered with last night were each indicating how tough the climbs were so that made me feel good too. I'd just rested for a few minutes and had a quick bit of food. And then all of a sudden I was exhausted. The trail was downhill and I just couldn't get going. Then came a small climb that was more difficult than it should've been. During my rest break, I'd made a reservation at Three Springs Hostel Bunk & Breakfast. They provide a free shuttle from the trail until 6:00. All of a sudden I realized that the pace I was now moving would barely get me there. Nothing to do but push through it.A hiker was coming towards me. For the first time ever, I realized I was thinking about how I didn't want to spend time talking with a hiker. And then my day turned around. His trail name is Bald Whistler. Before he got to me he was greeting me with ""Hey Rabbit!"" Rambo and the others were all ahead of me so he must've spoken with them. Bald Whistler is doing a flip-flop thru-hike that began in Harpers Ferry. First, he told me how wonderful Three Springs Hostel Bunk & Breakfast was. Then we talked trail. His enthusiasm was contagious and I could feel my energy being restored. He told me Saturday was coming behind him. Saturday got his trail name because he is retired and every day is Saturday. We parted after talking for a good 15 minutes. Then Saturday approached and he was positive too. We didn't talk for too long but it wasn't a blow-off period of time either. Okay, head was back in the game. But, my body wasn't moving fast enough. I calculated the hiking pace needed to hit my 6:00 shuttle deadline and was worried about hitting the deadline. The trail couldn't have been better as it consisted of pine needles or dirt. My hiking pace going downhill was all me and my awareness that my knees really were squawking as I planted to prevent going uncontrollably downhill. At least my pants were staying up. Forgot to tell you about that. I use a Z-pack 4-in-one pouch that hangs on my chest. I like it a lot to carry my electronics, money, and other small heavy items. It looks dorky but several hikers have asked about it and said they wanted one. Sometimes when hiking, the pouch lifts off my chest and returns to my chest with a bit of a punch to it. I don't like the punch but I've gotten used to it. Today's punch was extra annoying. No sooner than just after getting into, for me today, a nice rhythmic pace. The punch hit my pant's belt buckle and soon my pants were beginning to fall below my waist. And then they'd fall even lower and despite my trying to hike on, I knew I'd have to stop hiking to reattach my belt. And a few minutes later, the punch unsnapped my pants again. This annoying sequence repeated seemingly over and over again. No matter how I tried, I couldn't get my pants to stay up. Finally, I tried pulling my shorts up so high that my backpack waste belt held my pants up. Yes, I was almost giving myself a wedgie but I had to try something. It worked. But now my internal calculator was hitting an alarm button. I had hours to hike yet but the miles per hour required a faster pace than I was doing today. My most recent split time was a faster pace. Good. I'm coming around and will make it. I crossed a gravel road and was headed towards a suspension bridge. Rambo was behind a wall of brush and said my name. I came around to meet the Fairy Snack Mother, a name her daughter Kate had given her. Trail Angels are always positive and Fairy Snack Mother oozed positive feelings. She is providing trail support to her husband and daughter - Jay and Kate. They are flip-flopping their thru-hike. I could've stayed and talked with her all day. Eventually, I said good-bye and explained that I had this shuttle deadline. Internal calculator alarm was going off. I was off pace again; with less hiking hours available to spread the pace needed to make the deadline. And then I realized I'd be stopping to talk to Jay and Kate, who I figured would be wonderful people like the Fairy Snack Mother. Up around a bend and there was the reservoir. Beautiful. Idyllic. The sparkling water reminded me of ""On Golden Pond."" Between the shade and the cool breeze coming off the reservoir's water, my sweat was quickly going away. The reservoir walk was long. I savored it but know I would've enjoyed it even more if this shuttle deadline didn't exist. Yup, Jay and Kate were just as nice as I thought. Couldn't cut their talk time short. Rambo came behind me after a while. We all talked trail and then I explained my shuttle deadline and moved on while Rambo stayed to continue talking. That shuttle deadline was real. I was moving as fast as I could. I knew hiking next to the stream with its periodic cascading water would've been delightful if not for this deadline. No time available for that. Have I taken a picture of that flower? Really, now? Picture was gladly taken - this is my hike and I'll spend my time as I want. Okay, decisions have consequences. Hike faster. No, really hike faster. Finally. As I pass the last shelter of the day, I realize that a normal hiking pace will make the shuttle time. The final distance of almost 2 miles is a climb. It won't be easy but there is no choice. First, I hear a car then I see one going by in the distance. I took a picture of a typical AT road crossing. I took it because I've never been as happy to see those signs. I made it with 20 minutes to spare. Oma, the hostel's owner, is there to pick me up. I message Rambo the shuttle price info he asked me to get him.Three Springs Hostel Bunk & Breakfast is even nicer than Fresh Ground and Bald Whistler had told me it would be. It is an oasis. Oma and her daughter, Marcia, are very welcoming. Today's strain evaporates as I shower, do laundry, resupply, and enjoy the food available there.Positive sharing on the trail. The trail provides. The trail isn't easy. Many say hiking the AT is more of a mental challenge than a physical one. Today I confronted both. I barely got by - but I made it - today. Thanks to Bald Whistler, Saturday, and that great supportive family. Thanks to Oma and Marcia for this hiker oasis.","Johns Hollow Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528146,"Rambo and I could've stayed at Three Springs Hostel Bunk & Breakfast for a long time. Breakfast was delicious and we were so comfortable there. Eventually we knew we had to leave so we didn't resume hiking until 9:00 today. Today's hike began with a climb of almost 2000'. Some portions of the climb were vertically punishing but most of the climb was graded nicely. I took Ibuprofen for the first time and must admit that my knees felt better than they have felt in a long time. Rambo and I hiked together for the better part of the morning. This 23 year old has a big heart. He is such a strong hiker that he easily could've left me in the dust but he periodically stopped to wait for me before moving on. Rambo began working full time when he was 16. He was home schooled and graduated from high school then. The skills he has are many and it's pretty impressive to have done so much for as young as he is. He's also playful. We had a good time getting his kite to stay up in the air. He nearly split my head open with one of his kite's dive-bombing crashes. After a successful flight it was time to resume hiking. It was noon and we only had hiked 6 miles so we knew it was going to be a long day, but that was okay because we were having fun and not killing ourselves trying to hike a fast pace. Rambo chose a beautiful lunch spot with a view. There was a haze in the valley but the sky above us was picture-perfect blue. Jets had flown by leaving long clouds of spent fuel. I knew I'd be emotional and told Rambo to hang in there with me as I shared with him the story of my dad's burial. My siblings will remember this well because as Dr. Wilson finished his closing words we looked above us and somehow, as incredible and unbelievable as this may be, we looked above and there was a perfectly formed cross made of jet's spent fuel. Just as I thought, I couldn't tell that story without choking back a tear. I don't remember the transition to the next story right now, I just remember that I was almost crying one moment and then was laughing the next. This morning was my bonding time with Rambo. We'd hiked together as part of a bubble but never had one-on-one time before today. Rambo spoke of maintaining our bubble by having the two of us hiking together until Blues Brother hopefully is able to resume hiking with us.     I kept telling Rambo to feel free to hike at his faster pace and eventually we hiked separately in the afternoon. I was listening to some oldies - no singing though. The trail was almost all dirt and between my hiking at a slow pace and not having to angle around rocks as the hike continued, my knee felt as good as it did weeks ago. Rambo waited up ahead and asked how I was doing. I was able to honestly answer that I had hiked for an extended time because my knee was feeling so great. We both find our legs tighten up after taking breaks and resuming hiking starts very slow as our bodies work to resume hiking. Rambo was unfortunately not feeling like I was. He said he was as exhausted today as he was at the end of the day yesterday - and that wasn't good. We were away from any bail-out points so there was nothing to do but hike on. We both stopped as we got to the next shelter. Rambo was still not feeling great. The look on his face was painful. He was eating to overcome it, but said he was waiting to hear from Brave, trail angel of the past. Brave was going to provide some info about Lyme disease because Rambo had recently removed a tick. I hiked on because at my pace it was clear that I'd be hiking until the sun's last moments. After a few more miles with Rambo not catching and passing me, I really became worried about him. I called Oma to find out if Marcia or she could pick us up if Rambo continued to not feel well. Oma said she'd get there if we needed her. Fortunately Rambo came along with his usual face full of energy. He had drank some water and eaten some candy. He was back to feeling good. The end of the day finished with some small, but steep, climbs. I told Rambo to hike on to tonight's shelter destination and that I'd be there eventually. The Spy Rock campsite is heavily used. My hand-written notes on AWOL's guide indicated to be careful staying on the AT there. Rambo was coming back my way. The trail we'd briefly followed wasn't the AT. Going back a hundred yards, we then saw the very faded white blaze that indicated the AT was to the left at the Spy Rock campsite. I got to the shelter with 15 minutes of sun left. There were many hikers here. New thru-hikers were two strong hikers with trail names of Rhino and John Goodman. Rhino talked with us as we ate in the dark by headlamp. Such a better day for me. I was tired but it was a ""good"" tired.","US 60 - Three Springs Hostel Bunk & Breakfast 
",The Priest Shelter,"Apr 15, Fri",20.60
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528512,"The Priest Shelter has a unique tradition involving the shelter's log book. Hikers routinely sign their trail name, date, and a brief comment about their day's hike or their night in the shelter. Given that this is the ""Priest Shelter"", some hikers write a confession. I think I first learned of this tradition when Gangsta confesses to blaming her hiking partner, Wags, for a fart. Giggles, who I met in a shelter last week, confessed that having hiked over 800 miles, she had probably slept with 100 men and a number of women too (in a shelter). I confessed to abusing a body part - my knees!  After my confession, today's hike began. My right knee was a big problem. It was painful to plant that foot on anything other than a dirt path in a straight-forward direction. The descent from the Priest Shelter was almost 3,000' and the first hour required working around boulders and rocks. All I could muster was 3/4 of a mile in that first hour. It was a challenging morning mentally and I quickly abandoned my original hiking goal for that day. The good news was that I felt good about abandoning that goal. I embraced hiking slowly and did everything I could to not aggravate the knee further. I struggled with the awareness that whatever has surfaced with my knee could become a serious thru-hike challenge. So many of my hiking friends have been permanently stopped or have had to get off the trail to recover. I think all of us know that injuries happen sometimes but I don't think any of us dwell on it. It's like we think it isn't goIng to happen until it does. All of a sudden, my mind was going to this undesirable place as each step continually reminded me of my inability to hike free of pain or concern.Fortunately it was the weekend, a beautiful weekend, so the trail was full of day hikers that could distract me. I met Blueberry and Wizard, who hiked the entire trail in 2008-9. They were out to do trail maintenance. Wizard was carrying a substantial saw that was strapped to him in what appeared to be a backpack or attachment that was specifically designed to enable carrying such a saw. Between the other hikers and listening to music, I successfully drowned out negative thoughts.My revised destination for today was Maupin Field Shelter. I decided to stay there for the night as soon as I heard that the unreliable water source there was flowing. I stopped hiking shortly after 4:00 which is really early for me. Tents and hikers were everywhere. A crowd was hanging around the shelter's picnic table but I went there anyhow because of its close proximity to the water source. Despite the crowd there, it seemed like there were spaces available in the shelter. As I was filtering water, I asked about shelter space and was told the assembled crowd was saving that for thru-hikers. Heads turned when I said I was thru-hiking. Lots of questions about my hike and thru-hiking in general. John introduced himself and said the last beer was mine. I learned that most around the shelter table were members of a hiking group from Raleigh. They made me feel very welcome and made space for me to sit with them. My knee stiffens up pretty quickly and got their attention with concern. John turned out to be a medic. After he identified his profession, he asked if I wanted to discuss my knee, so I did. Based on my explanation, he stated that it sounded like a meniscus problem that wouldn't prevent me from continuing to hike but would make hiking more difficult depending on the severity of the meniscus problem. Okay, at least that was some good news. I was pleased with hiking almost 14 miles today over some challenging trail - Priest's descent was tough and the climb up and then down Three Ridges Mountain was tough too. I settled in the shelter and continued to speak with various hiking group members. The group was clearly enjoying themselves. As the evening progressed, Steve came to me and identified himself as a chiropractor who would be happy to work on my knee. Steve also thought it was a meniscus problem. He applied pressure and my knee felt better after he was done. My good fortune continues. What were the chances that I'd hobble in and get such assistance. I tried to write this entry while enjoying the big camp fire everyone gathered around but the conversation was too engaging and then I gave in to the weariness of this day.","The Priest Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528603,"Leaving the shelter this morning was an experience. Goodwill was coming at me from everyone that gathered early around a morning campfire. This hiking group was rooting for me. I could feel it. Four members offered me ibuprofen. Food was offered and I accepted an apple but then explained I was not attempting to yogi the other food they were offering. Steve came and repeated his kindness on my knee. I turned and yelled back to make sure he saw how much better I was able to hike. Before leaving the large tenting area, another group member wished me well. So is my knee feeling better? I think it was. John, the medic, emphasized that I should attempt to keep my foot's placement in the direction consistent with my torso. I tried to follow his guidance. Many hikers bare pain. We often don't talk about it and instead discuss how tired we are or how strong we feel at the end of the day. I've read many journals during the last several years. I have sometimes been surprised that no mention is made of a physical problem and then, seemingly out of nowhere, the hiker is off the trail. I don't think my thru-hike is in danger but I am writing now to not gloss over this and recognize that my movement is strained and inhibited. The trail was primarily sloped dirt. Rocks and boulders appeared in spots - one so much that I badly wished I was hiking with Blues Brother because we would've had a great time chirping about it. My pace was consistently two miles per hour. I appreciated the lack of rocks and boulders. I fear that if this knee surfaced in Pennsylvania, that is known for extensive trail of sharp rocks, then I suspect the coming days would be so much more difficult and right now I hope to make my way forward instead of immediately pausing for medical evaluation. Time will tell whether moving forward is foolish.  Hiking slower and by myself creates time to think. My song title choice was a thought that lingered for a good while. No question that my home is my ultimate better place. But attempting to work through this became my mindset and I was heartened as being able to hike 20 miles today became an obtainable goal.  The trail was again filled with day hikers. Maybe I was lonely. After two young couples passed and I could see a third approaching, I smiled and preempted their saying ""Hi"" by blurting out that today's young couples were killing me. I said I'd been hiking since mid-February and my wife was in Connecticut. Could Beth have really been here a week ago? It seemed so much longer than that. The next couple was around my age. I was asked about the ""Virginia Blues"". She seemed to have personally taken an affront to being aware that some thru-hikers think Virginia is a bit of a let down. I told her that it seemed to me that Virginia was the state in which the AT honeymoon was over and that thru-hikers were confronting the reality of how difficult hiking the AT is.I was glad to reach Rockfish Gap in daylight. It meant being able to stay in a hotel tonight and being able to ice my knee while enjoying a good meal and making sure I was hydrated. Dinosaur, a successful thru-hiker who currently works for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy picked me up after about 15 minutes trying to hitch a ride. Dinosaur was full of info about the trail and told me about Konnarock, an organization that enables individuals to join others for a week to work on trail maintenance and learn new skills. She said similar organizations exist up north so I'll have to look into those after this is over. Long day. The day's heat gave way to a final couple of comfortable hours. I never thought it would be easy.","Maupin Field Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528629,"Today was a day to resupply, wash clothes, and eat and drink to put some weight back on as preparation for my return to the AT tomorrow. I purchased a knee bandage that says it will moderately support my knee. The cashier at CVS looked over my purchases and asked how my hike was going. Before leaving the store, the woman behind me offered to drive me to where I needed to go. She later told me that she had a knee replacement so she must've taken some pity on me. Then Casey sent me an e-mail to inform me about the big fire in Shenandoah National Park that I'll enter tomorrow morning.  Bruce from Raleigh came to Waynesboro to take me to dinner and talk trail. Bruce drove me to the local outfitter store for some hiker-specific resupply items. The meal was great but the bigger treat was discussing the AT and hearing about hikes he already has undertaken. Trust me that Bruce will be successful when he hikes the AT in 2018. Bruce knows the AT real well and his preparation is phenomenal.  Waynesboro is a hiker friendly town. A list of trail angels who will provide rides to and from the trailhead is widely distributed. Astros will pick me up in the morning and take me to Rockfish Gap to resume my hike. So many people going above and beyond to help hikers like me. Last Chance said it best ""It restores your faith in humanity.""

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528820,"Meet Linda and Bob. They were my trail angels today. They were driving south on Skyland Drive when a stranger on the side of the road put out his hands and begged them to stop. They stopped and, after listening to my plight, agreed to let me in their car - eventually taking me back to Waynesboro, my starting point for today's hike.I was aware of the big fire in Shenandoah National Park. A sign at the self-registration entry point for Shenandoah National Park instructed me to call the same hotline number I'd called yesterday. The news about the fire hadn't changed and I was good to hike to my destination today and instructed to call again tomorrow for information regarding the existing closure area of the AT due to the fire. AT thru-hikers were being allowed to walk on Skyland Drive to bypass the 4-mile section of the AT that was closed.So my focus was on my knee. It seemed a bit better than a couple days ago, presumably because of not being used for a day and instead being iced a number of times. The trail consisted mainly of dirt. There were a couple climbs that surprised me from the perspective of how vertical they were. The descents were vertical too. My knee held up until it didn't. My knee locks up after a stop of more than a minute. The restart usually takes a couple minutes but then I'm able to hike without pain at a 2 mile per hour pace. Except that I had one sequence that took a good 10 - 15 minutes of confusing, painful hiking.After 8 miles a spring finally was available to provide the day's first water source. I could see a woman sitting. The woman turned out to be Blissful, a ridge runner specifically sitting there to provide new fire information that was just one hour old. The AT closure area had expanded. I could still stay at tonight's destination but would be stopped 4 miles later. I hiked on with Blissful asking about my leg after watching my laboring departure.My progress was fine. I got a message from Who-Dat that he was returning to the trail but would be limiting his miles to 15 per day, presumably due to his recent bout with shin splints. I spoke with a group of 3 male section hikers and then one female hiker. They were going south and so we exchanged water source and camping site info.It was the middle of the afternoon and I was comfortably hiking at a pace that would give me time to eat dinner and get settled for the night. I went to check my maps and went nuts when I realized that they'd fallen out of my pocket. I have the same maps as a pdf file but have my notes on the paper version. I dropped my pack and started to go back to find them. I hated the idea of littering the trail and wanted my maps back. Ten minutes later I turned back and accepted that it was foolish to spend up to an hour and a half to go back to the last point that I recalled using them.MT was sitting on the side of the trail enjoying a break for food. We talked about the fire. Last night, he had stayed at the shelter I was headed to. I pointed out the very visible white smoke that consistently appeared on the opposite side of the ridge line that was one valley away. MT took my info so that he could get my maps back to me if he found them. I noticed a voicemail from Rambo so I listened to it as I walked away from MT. Rambo wanted to let me know that he and two others he was with, Bonnie and Clyde, had just been shuttled off the AT by a park ranger. He was still with the ranger and informed her of my location. The instructions were to stop and turn around. The fire area was expanding. I should get to Skyline Drive and try to hitch a ride south or stay on the road and expect that a ranger would eventually come along to drive me out. So I turned around and saw MT again. I was ecstatic when I saw two cars going south.Not sure what will happen tomorrow. I told Beth I was safe and would call the hotline in the morning for current closure info. I'll then use a list of Waynesboro shuttle drivers to see if any is available to shuttle me north of the fire for a fee. I don't think the AT closure area will be open for days so I'll deal with the missing section later and can speak with Appalchian Trail Conservancy officials in Harper's Ferry. I'm sure there will be a good number of thru-hikers who will have to skip some miles because of the fire.Thanks to Linda, Bob, and Blissful. I needed their help today.","Waynesboro - Quality In

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528862,"Brave, an extraordinary trail angel who has already helped me and other thru-hikers, continues to amaze. Brave coordinated shuttles for thru-hikers to drive us around the Shenandoah National Park fire. Anne was my latest trail angel. Anne picked me up at Waynesboro's Quality Inn and drove me to Swift Run Gap, where we are permitted to hike north of the fire. I hiked 17.6 miles today but am showing 48.8 in order to accurately display where I finished hiking on the trail today.Anne's driving was so much more than a ride. As I was driven, I got a glimpse of the Shenandoah National Park fire through Anne. Mountain range views that should've appeared were obliterated from the fire's ashen clouds. Anne understood the Shenandoah National Park fire from the perspective of nature's burning today to enable tomorrow's regeneration but was so saddened by the reality of that fire and the removal of beauty she knew so well. We drove passed sections of seemingly active fire that was spewing violent-looking pillars of smoke. Blue sky eventually appeared; an indication that my AT hike was about to continue. A huge thanks to Anne for her kindness and sharing and my hope that she will experience the beauty of this park's regeneration. And thanks to Brave for bringing Anne and me together today.It felt odd to begin at a new location; my AT hike's continuity was broken. It was past noon when I began hiking, that was odd too. If not painfully aware of the fire's brutality that was raging south of me, I'd be hiking on a warm, beautiful day. I heard music as I stopped for a snack. It became louder and soon I heard ""Rabbit!!!"" Rambo is the only hiker I know who periodically plays music without earphones. Through the fire's shutting down sections of the AT, we'd been taken to a safe section to hike. We were able to hike together again and Rambo quickly introduced me to Bonnie & Clyde. These two seemed larger than life just like the pair whose names they'd taken as trail names. Bonnie & Clyde began their northbound thru-hike in November 2015. They'd camped for days in multiple feet of snow. They'd gone off trail for 12 days to a hostel to let Bonnie recover from a badly sprained ankle. Clyde currently hikes with a broken bone in his foot but hikes faster than anyone I've seen. When asked about his speed and his ankle, Clyde pounds his chest and speaks of his heart. This group's hiking pattern consists of Clyde tearing ahead with Rambo only to stop and wait for Bonnie to catch-up, and now for me to catch-up too. Rambo has hiked with Bonnie and Clyde for a few days so he told me a bit about them. They hail from New York and have known each other since they were teenagers. Clyde proposed to Bonnie on McAfee Knob and plans have already been made to be married on Mt. Katahdin's summit when they get there. This couple exudes fun and a spirit of enjoying this trail and their time sharing it together. I told Rambo how lucky he was to have come across these two, but he already knew that.Our destination for tonight was agreed upon. It would be a push to Big Meadows Campground but we all wanted to get in a meaningful hike today after being sidelined. Night came and I was separated from the three of them who were ahead trying to make arrangements for the night's stay. Darkness wasn't my friend and I found myself hiking with a horrible sense that I'd somehow missed a white blaze's turn. The trail was rocky and passed through edges that seemed uncomfortably exposed in the darkness. I seriously considered turning around since it seemed like forever since I'd seen a white blaze or a stone pillar that provides navigation directions in Shenandoah National Park. I chose to push forward and then saw buildings that I understood to be Big Meadows Lodge. But the trail then took me away from the light of those buildings and that was disconcerting too. Finally, a pillar directing me to the campground. But my hiking partners weren't there so I began going in one direction and then another trying to find them. In the distance were three headlamps and I quickly moved to them. They had first gone to the Lodge to try to register there. We headed to the Campground's office and quickly entered the campground's laundry room that had lights and heat. It was cold outside so we took the opportunity to open our packs and put on clothing for tonight's sleep. Another camper arrived and she explained the camp and how the sites were set up for cars or campers. Since she just had a tent, she said we could all easily fit in her site. So we went there. I fumbled with my tent's setup. Clyde eventually broke away from the picnic table to offer help just as I was finally getting the tent's rods inserted as the first part of the setup. We ate and hoisted our bear bags. As we settled in for the night in the darkness, Rambo said how happy he was to be together again. Clyde added how he was enjoying it too. And I finished it with my concurrence. It seemed we were a long way from where we each started today.","Skyline 92.4 - Back To Waynesboro

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529454,"Was up and out earlier than normal. My motivation came from my desire to have breakfast at Skyland Restaurant but that meant hiking almost 8 miles before the restaurant's 10:30 deadline. Since we carry our food on our backs, being able to buy a hot meal with a cold beverage was a treat. I saw CandleMaker as I walked in with 15 minutes to spare. The buffet was great and I ate and drank way too much. The good pace that I had to get there was never matched during the rest of the day.  Views today lacked clarity due to a haze created by the Shenandoah National Park fire. Shenandoah's sparkle was a no-show and word came that the fire zone had expanded again. So today became a day of getting through it. A man sitting in the lobby was interested in my thru-hike and went out of his way to express his thinking of how such an undertaking was inspirational. I thanked him for his kind words and that just seemed to motivate him further to make certain how deeply he felt what he said. Our conversation ended with him standing to shake hands. Later in the day, I met Helen and John as they hiked down a rocky descent. They are respectively 78 and 72 years old. They too asked about my hike and were somewhat critical of their own hike. I did everything I could to get them to realize that hiking where they were hiking was significantly harder than walking around their neighborhood as they characterized their effort. Interactions like these happen with increasing frequency now that my physical appearance makes me stand out as being a bit different.  A number of us gathered around the shelter and picnic table that evening. Topics included the fire and the status of other hikers' hikes. We finished with a discussion of tomorrow's hiking plans. When I revealed my intent to hike in to Front Royal, a distance of 26.5 miles, John Goodman summed it up best saying ""Oh Rabbit"". Everyone wished me well but there was a good bit of skepticism about such an endeavor.  I had to force the mileage entered as today's miles. Today's hike was 18.4 miles. Total distance should now be 942.6 miles.","Big Meadows Campground

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529504,"Big effort needed today. Even I was taken back by what I was taking on - my biggest mileage day to date. Helping me was my expectation that the trail would be a mix of dirt and stones like much of the AT has been in Shenandoah National Park. My food bag was pretty light so my backpack was comparatively light. Of concern beyond the number of miles was my right knee and whether it would hold up the whole way. Then was the rain that was forecasted to last all day culminating in heavy rain at 5:00 p.m.. And lastly was my needing a ride at day's end, potentially near darkness. A lot on my mind as the day's hike began at 6:00 a.m.. This was my first start so early in the morning and within the first minutes I startled a deer that quickly scampered away. The rain held off until I reached the Elkwallow Wayside at 9:05. It was great to get a good breakfast and a milkshake. The rain was heavy enough to require rain gear but it wasn't pouring so badly that I couldn't see where I was going or bad enough to make the rocks so slippery that they were dangerous. The fog was significant and viewing spots were passed quickly because all that could be seen was endless white mist and fog. My thoughts turned to all the people in my life and these thoughts brought many smiles. CandleMaker and John Goodman passed me during the morning but that was expected since they are both so much stronger hikers than I ever was. I was on pace throughout the day and I was happy about it.  The rain stopped around 2:00 and the sun dried out the trail a bit. I went by a reasonably large area that seemed like it was burned years ago. New vegetation was underway and I wondered how long regeneration took. This morning I heard that the Shenandoah National Park fire was 40% under control and now spanned 8,000 acres. I tired as the day kept on going. I realized that some trail wasn't the easy tread that I had counted on. I put headphones on to get motivated for the final miles. Just as the day had begun, a deer greeted me with curiosity. For the first time of this hike, I was critical of the decisions I was making. Hiking alone with nobody coming behind me this late wasn't smart. I nearly had a face plant a half hour earlier and realized then that such a fall could've been a big problem. I was relieved when it became apparent that today's hike was over. It was a little after 7:00 and that meant daylight should help me hitch a ride of almost 4 miles into Front Royal. Car after car went by, all moving quickly. I gave up and began walking to town. Jim Hoover came to my rescue saying that he picked up hikers all the time because those that came out of trail looked like they were exhausted and needed the ride. Yes, that described me perfectly. Getting out of Jim's car was a slow process. I stiffened up badly and I doubt that anyone who looked at me would've believed that I hiked a marathon today.  Today's hike ended my time through Shenadoah National Park.

I ate and drank so that my body got stronger for the next sequence of hikes. Laundry and resupply tasks were done too. Time was taken to ice and rest my knee.  It was pouring outside when we woke up and I was glad I wasn't out on such a nasty day. Rambo sent a message and we picked him up at the trail location that was my stopping point last night. Rambo was in great spirits despite being soaked. Within a short while Rambo decided to zero too. It was great because it gave Beth the chance to spend quality time with him and I enjoy my fellow hikers getting to know Beth too.  Having a car available to get around enables so much to get done without effort and expending energy. Front Royal doesn't have an outfitter store but Harpers Ferry does, so we drove the hour to get there. Rambo and I both got new boots. I got new pants too to accommodate my reduced waistline. And we got lost a time or two along the way resulting in laughter and enjoyment. We stopped in at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters. Rambo and I should hike there in 3 days. The headquarters is the unofficial midway point of a thru-hike. Polaroid pictures are taken of every hiker who passes through. The pictures are catalogued in volumes of books by year. I could've spent hours there looking up hikers from past years but settled to only review this year's pictures. I saw the dates that Patches and Marathon went by. E-mail addresses are routinely listed with the pictures so I took the opportunity to enter a few in my phone so that I can contact these people with info about my hike and questions about theirs. Judy had recently asked a question about how we exchange info to stay in touch. I routinely exchange info with hikers that I hike with for several days but I don't always get such info for some so I felt lucky to have this additional chance to enable future contact. Rambo got a message from Bonnie and Clyde so plans have been made for us to resume hiking tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. at the trail so that all of us can hike together for a celebration in Harpers Ferry. That's perfect since it means Beth will be able to meet Bonnie and Clyde before she heads home. I got a message from Last Chance. He and Seeker will be driven to Swift Run Gap to start Last Chance's final days of hiking. He'll complete his thru-hike in Harpers Ferry and it's too bad we can't be there for that celebration too. Beth heads home with some gear I no longer want to carry. Hopefully the reduced gear will offset the additional food I'll carry out for the next several days of hiking. I feel badly that Beth's trip this time was selfishly devoted to enabling my hike. We've taken time in her prior visits to do something that includes a vacation-like activity but weren't able to do that this time. I am walking more easily by the end of the day so at least she shouldn't leave wondering about this concern as much. No question I couldn't be to this point without her unwavering support and assistance. I realize how dependent I am on her. She's made a huge sacrifice but hasn't complained a bit. When she's not around, Rambo goes out of his way to let me know how much he likes her. He gets it. I enjoy telling him and having him experience just how lucky I am.","Front Royal - Quality Inn

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529716,"Beautiful day. The trail was a dirt path almost the whole day. Pink and white trillium were abundant for much of the day. The day cooled nicely as the day ended. Beth dropped Rambo and me off at the trailhead at 10:00 and we began hiking at 10:15. We didn't connect with Bonnie and Clyde as we hoped. We learned that Bonnie and Clyde intended to stay at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter for the night. They made a great choice. Rambo and I stopped for lunch around noon at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter. This shelter was spotless and has a 3-person wooden lawn chair, a separate eating area with a large picnic table, a solar shower, and a horseshoe pit. This is an ideal place to stay if it fits into your schedule. Rambo reviewed the shelter's log book and saw that CandleMaker and Booty were at this shelter yesterday. A note said to read J's entry that is shown as today's picture. J wrote so simply and so powerfully. I hiked a good bit today thinking how Mother's Day is quickly coming up. Rambo and I talked about how lucky we were to have the mothers and families we had. The loss of a parent at such a young age must be devastating. I thought about a great colleague, Bill Calhoun, and how his joyful spirit left us at such a young age. Bill left a beautiful family. Last I heard, Bill's wife and family continued to live while continuing to remember this great guy. A reminder to all of us to enjoy every precious moment of life and to make sure those we love know we love them. Bill loved his family and the way he spoke of them made it undeniably clear that they knew and felt his love. When today's hike began, I never envisioned reading such an entry and having it capture my attention the way it did.  Given such a beautiful day on the weekend, many day hikers were out to enjoy this beautiful trail. Some sections were steep but everyone had smiles on their faces. Various hikers asked about my thru-hike. At the shelter tonight, I again got the ""you look to clean to be a thru-hiker"" comment that's been sent my way at least a half dozen times. I shared the comment with Rambo so that he could get a laugh at my expense. Blues Brother and Fresh Ground would've had a good time with it too. And so did I.","Front Royal - Quality Inn

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529868,"First an update that should've been included in yesterday's post, I had my second worst fall during the beginning of the hike. My left hiking pole suffered the most and has a substantial crack in it to the extent that I can't use it for hiking. I think it can still be used to hold up my tent so I'll keep it until replacements are purchased. I simply tripped and went down quickly. Today's picture was the big story of the day. Hiking the roller coaster. I don't even ride roller coasters at carnivals because I'm afraid of heights. (I know you're asking why then am I hiking mountains.) The AT roller coaster consists of a 13.5 mile stretch in which there are many ascents and descents between 400' to 500'. The number of these ups and downs is unusual and having them continuously back-to-back is unusual. The roller coaster wiped me out. I loved it. The roller coaster section of the AT is my favorite so far in terms of hiking. I have more favorite spots for the spectacular views but for just hiking this is it. The trail was vertical with lots of rocks. Having just one hiking pole available for use made it harder than it should've been. Having a knee that still doesn't move as well as I'd like added to the challenge. This roller coaster was beautifully created. It seemed that the AT and Spring got together today and decided to show off. Some stretches of trail were beyond beautiful with filtered light making the vibrant greens along the trails pop out. There were many easy water crossings but they added to this roller coaster experience. There were several stone walls and a sign posted early in this section made me wonder whether some of these fences were created during the Civil War. Flowers were showing off too. I came to Bears Den Hostel as tired as I can recall. My miles per hour today were quite low. It didn't matter. Today's hike had what I think of when I think about the AT. Glad to be here. Added treat today was passing 1,000 miles.","Dicks Dome Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530046,"Today was another milestone day. Virginia is done; the state with more AT miles than any other state. Harpers Ferry is the home of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and tradition calls for taking a picture at this approximate midway point. I am #60 for this year's northbound thru-hikers.To get here required finishing the final roller coaster miles and those miles provided more ups and downs. The AT was relatively smooth after that which was kind on my knees. There was a rock scramble or two along the way that required diligent adherence to finding the next white blaze before taking your next step. It would've been easy to lose the trail if one assumed where the trail went.Yesterday's beauty disappeared and today's trail lacked flowers and color; the dominant color today was moldy brown leaves. The few hikers I saw today coming from Harpers Ferry seemed unusual in that the packs they carried seemed unlikely to be able to sustain backpacking. One woman wore cotton blue jeans and had a pack that featured an extremely bulky winter coat. Then there were a couple of young female hikers with one carrying so much billowy bedding that it stuck out on each side as well as out of the top of her backpack. It was the first time that I felt I was seeing homeless people hiking to an AT shelter. An exception to these hikers was running into three hikers that I'd met a couple days earlier. These three - Trailbeard, Tortilla Tosser, and Stone Heart - are hiking in flip-flop fashion. They were fun to speak with the first time I met them and were great to speak with today. Given the way they are hiking, it seems possible that I could run into them again along the trail - hope so.If you have been reading entries submitted on my sign-in pages then you've been entertained by my best friend before college. He's just asked about hiking together in July. I've just recently conceptualized mileage scenarios through the next month and intend to create a plan of sorts for the remainder of the AT in another month. I like the idea of hiking with friends and think such hiking will add to the memories of this adventure. Hiking with Mark will have real challenges though. First, there is the issue of his eyesight. You need to see the trail in front of you in order to hike it and his consistent references to me as ""Ugly"" make me wonder if his eyes are adequate for the trail. He also has mentioned a couple times about how I caused him damage while playing basketball many years ago. I have two concerns regarding that. I recall carrying him and our church's basketball team during those basketball seasons and am already carrying a full load on my back so I am not sure if I can also carry his aging 6' 8"" skeleton again. Then there's the issue of his flexibility. In high school, he got hurt trying to catch a pass that required him jumping about an inch off the ground. That proved to be too great a task so I'm wondering if his gangly legs will be able to stretch as is needed to hike from one step to the next. These are my initial thoughts but I'll think on this as I hike to figure this out.Hard to believe that I've hiked to Harpers Ferry. Thanks to all for your good wishes and support. I hike knowing there are many helping me along the way and want you all to know how happy and important having you with me enables this hike's continuation.","Bears Den Hostel

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530197,"Took advantage of the hotel's ice machine to repeatedly ice my knee. Then paid a small fee to be driven back to the trail since the hotel was one mile from where my hike ended the prior day. Mention this because my hiking day didn't start until 10:00 a.m. which is about 3 hours later than usual. Rambo was already one mile ahead at today's start and my delayed start finds him 7.5 miles ahead by the end of today. We each are hiking as we are able. We exchanged a few e-mails today and I told him I'd probably be looking to get more ice time on Friday. Suspect this mileage difference is about to increase and that this could be a permanent separation between us.  The good news is that by delaying my start and not hiking until sundown, I don't think I overtaxed my knee. Today's mileage is less than I have been doing but I am trying to accept such mileage as a new norm if such mileage is what seems best for my knee. The trail today was phenomenal. West Virginia was left very early in the day as I entered Maryland. Maryland trail was identified on an information sign as being easier than the typical AT and I'd wholeheartedly agree after today's hike. The trail was wide and was dirt-based to the extent that it reminded me of park walking back home. Rocks on the trail could be bypassed because of the trail's width. Hikers can move through such trail very quickly. Some hikers go for the 4-State Challenge which consists of hiking within 24 hours from the last step in Virginia, through West Virginia, through Maryland, and to the first step in Pennsylvania. The challenge to hike the AT is a great enough challenge for me.  The weather today was supposed to rain all day but ended up just threatening to rain. The cloud cover kept the temperature cooler than it otherwise would've been. Picture taking was limited though as the day became soupier as the day went on. The trail passed Gathland State Park where a monument exists to honor war correspondents. This same area had a historical past from the Civil War and it was enlightening to read various information boards that described what took place here. The plaque honoring four who died covering the War On Terrorism reminded me of the brutality that exists in today's world far away from this peaceful trail.    I spoke with several hikers at the hotel during breakfast. There were probably more hikers that were within 10 years of my age than I've seen while being out here. I came upon one of these couples several miles into today's hike. They are Pak and Ibu, north-bound hikers from Oklahoma who began their hike about 200 miles ago. Their trail names hail from Indonesia where they recently lived while working. Nice people who are referred collectively as the Tortillas because of their practice of offering other hikers their tortillas in order to reduce the weight in their packs. We briefly hiked together today and then found ourselves being the only hikers at the Rocky Run Shelters. There are actually two shelters at this spot and we're staying in the new one that is big enough for 16 hikers. We primarily talked about our families and gear. It's always nice to meet new people out here. Thought I'd have time to figure out my hiking plans for the next few days but we talked until near sunset and hiker midnight. Maryland's miles are few so Pennsylvania is just around the corner. It was fun to see my friend's response to my initial concerns about his hiking with me. Seems I have to add his faulty memory to the list of concerns. Maybe I'll have to have him wear a bear bell or something so that I can keep track of him on the trail. With that faulty memory, I don't want him to wander off and forget which way he's hiking.","Harpers Ferry

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530416,"Never had a day like this before - a day seemingly split into several parts. The day began with pleasant conversation with the Tortillas in beautiful Rocky Run Shelter. My hike began a little before 8:00 because I didn't want to wake them up too early with the noise of me assembling my backpack.  My knee was feeling a bit better right from the start and gave me hope that I could reach my destination goal of Rocky Run Shelter, another relatively new 16-person shelter that I hoped would have an open spot for me even if I arrived at the end of the day. The soupy mist quickly transitioned into a steady drizzle. I began the day with my rain gear - an E-Vent Packa- already around my backpack and ready for me to put my arms in it to stay dry. Maryland does a real nice job commemorating their history, in this case the Civil War, and I came upon a field that was the site of importance that now was memorialized with monuments and plaques. It wasn't difficult to imagine the bloodshed in this now peaceful place. Moving on, I came upon the first monument built in recognition of our nation's first President. I went to get a drink of water from a nearby fountain and then a constant rain began that lasted for the next two hours. I moved through this park and was able to read and enjoy the various informative plaques about George Washington. The Washington Monument itself was closed for repairs due to a lightning strike but that was okay because it probably would've been a tight squeeze negotiating the stairs with my backpack. I moved on and embraced the rainy day - not enough though to intentionally jump in the puddles that quickly formed on the trail, but I was aware of how dry this Spring has been and had an appreciation for the needed rain. The rain ended around noon as I headed to Pine Knob Shelter to take off my backpack and get lunch. Food was left in a plastic bag at the shelter and a hiker had told me earlier about this trail magic. Just as I was about to open a package of Sweedish Fish candy, another person showed up. He said the food was his. Embarrassed, I explained what I'd been told as I reassembled his plastic bag of food. Then he asked me where his red Sea To Summit bag was and all I could do was say that it wasn't there when I arrived and how I suspected that others like me had assumed his stuff was trail magic and helped themselves to it. He then explained how he arrived at the shelter long after everyone in the shelter was asleep and pointed to where he'd hammocked for the night, quite a distance away and out of eyesight. I continued to apologize but there was nothing more I could do for him. I didn't ask why he left his food unattended, a real no-no because there are signs everywhere reminding us to hang bear bags to prevent bears from smelling and coming to the shelters for food. He then said this would be the last time he slept in late - it was noon! After eating lunch, I waved and apologized one more time. All of a sudden there were other hikers everywhere. I stopped to let the adult chaperones know how engaged and polite their young hikers were - apparently there was an outing from Green Acres School in Washington County - somebody seems to be doing something right there based on my interaction with numerous young people in small groups. More varied hikers and quick AT exchanges. Then I was passed by a couple of new hikers with backpacks and I began to wonder if I have now accepted a much slower pace than I used to hike. It got colder and I could see my breath, a reminder that these conditions were perfect for hypothermia and that I better remember to maintain my body heat through hiking or put on more clothing.  Around 2:00 the trail became rockier than it had previously been. Selectively stepping and planting my feet became needed. Then the trail became a boulder field that required decision making about which sequence of boulders would be used. The boulder field seemed to go on forever, and was consistently uphill. I caught myself before falling and used that as a reminder to slow down since falling here would be a bruise at best. Finally the boulders ended and the trail moved below a line that had exposed this cold day to some wind that made for an even colder experience. I appreciated walking below a long series of boulders that were easily 30 yards tall. It was then that I remebered reading about Maryland's two poisonous snakes. I've seen enough movies to look at the stacks of boulders and envision what was probably in those countless crevices. I checked m my guide and realized I must be passing Black Rock Cliffs. And then the trail turned to those cliffs. It was a sharp turn and the trail was steep. Yup, I was hiking to be on top of those boulders. Fortunately the trail took me down the other side as quickly as it had brought me up it. Yes, I was conscious the whole time of what was in front and beside me. Poison ivy was everywhere and the trail was narrower than usual.  The trail became dirt-based again. It was a little passed 4:00 as I came upon a shelter. I either needed to stay here or move on to the next one another 5 miles up the trail. The decision was easy when I counted how many hikers were already at this shelter. I didn't think there would be room for me there and I was hoping to not tent today given how wet the ground was and how more rain was in the forecast for tonight. Hiking on, a group of 7 military hikers came southbound and they weren't happy when I told them how full the shelter was that they were headed to. I hate hikes that have climbs at the end of the day when I'm already tired and needing food and rest. The AT does what it wants though and gave me a good climb before my final destination. Maryland trails are really well done. The final climb was steep in parts but was wide and made for as pleasant an undertaking as is possible. Daylight was giving up to the return of this morning's misty soup. Made it. My long awaited shelter sign was in front of me. I counted 5 around a fire and was happy to see that since this shelter could hold 16. Then came the unexpected - Rabbit! It was Rambo. He was soaked and decided to wait for me here and go into Waynesboro tomorrow to dry out and resupply. Rambo says Bonnie and Clyde will be staying one shelter behind me - bad news for them because of how full that shelter was - and hopefully they'll join us in Waynesboro too. The young hiker arrived who stopped me before I ate his candy. Rambo and another hiker around the fire confessed that they and others had divied up some of his food. Rambo returned the red bag. Apologies were extended and accepted. Glad to be out here and glad there was room in this shelter for me. Loudest shelter I've encountered. Two loud snorers on my right who periodically wake themselves up and have no problem talking to each other (another no-no at night) and another loud snorer on my left. The rain has been consistently hitting the roof. Think I'll need some rest in Waynesboro.","Rocky Run Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530585,"Thank you Maryland. Sorry to see you go by so quickly. Maryland would be a great place to complete practice hikes. The AT is consistently identified with white blazes and the trail has a good mix of dirt, stone, and boulders. The shelters I saw or stayed at were really nice. The south part of the state is relatively easy but the northern part has plenty of climbs and descents to provide a challenge without being overly difficult.  Rambo and I hiked 5 miles today because we needed to resupply for the next several days. Some hikers would probably hike the 5 miles, complete their resupply, and then hike back out for additional miles. We chose to stay in town so that laundry could be done, calories could be increased, and plenty of ice could be applied to my knees.There was lots of eating done today. Initial breakfast before the hike began, another breakfast after we got into Waynesboro, a good all you can buffet at Old City Buffet, and then a burger with fries and a milkshake in the evening. And snacks throughout the afternoon that were purchased at Walmart where we replenished our food bags. We successfully hitched a couple times today. Good thing too because the road walks would've been long and exactly what I didn't want for my knees and legs. Today I wanted to rest. My knees are feeling better and I wanted an off day to continue to reduce the level of stress I put on them in recent weeks. In addition to the kindness provided by our two drivers, we also got well wishes from a number of people as we walked by. As Rambo said in Walmart, we really stick out (due to our appearance and those backpacks and hiking poles that never leave us).  Rambo got a message from Brave that she'd come to Waynesboro to have dinner with us. It was great to see and thank her for all she's done for us and other hikers. She had just gotten word that AT hikers could hike through all of Shenandoah National Park so she was busy informing others to enable such hiking. It seems like she's always working on behalf of hikers. I got to talk with Beth and friends from home tonight. That was nice and I wish I could've been there. But I'll hopefully be there soon.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530713,"Soup was on this morning's menu as today's hike continued with gray and limited visibility. Soggy, a trail angel friend of Brave's, was coming to take Rambo and me to breakfast but I opted to begin hiking instead because I knew that to get to today's destination would take many hours of effort on my part. I'm not complaining. It is just the reality that Rambo is a much faster hiker than I am so he can start later in the morning and still hike 20+ miles. So I joined Pak and Ibu in a shuttle to the trailhead at 7:00 a.m. from Roger. Roger (717-977-6548 or 717-762-1217) just charges $5 per person for the drive from Days Inn to the trailhead which is a real bargain. Trust me, you don't want to walk back, which is almost all uphill. Roger charges the same fee to be picked up at Pen Mar Road or similar AT spots. The trail today was dirt-based. And I am enjoying it while it lasts. Pennsylvania is commonly referred to as Rocksylvania but I only got brief tastes of the rocks today. There were a few notable climbs but, for as steep as they were, they were manageable. Surprises came as there was a water spigot at the Old Forge Picnic Area and then the bigger surprise that Caledonia State Park had a water fountain and restrooms open. There were many cars parked there and I suspected people were hiking various trails because there weren't many extra weekend hikers on the AT. I ate dinner at one of the picnic tables and was able to get a drink, wash up, and throw away my trash inside the restroom. I realize this probably seems to be not be a big deal, but trust me when I say that amenities like this are greatly appreciated, particularly when they come as a surprise. Rambo caught me just before my last two miles. I'd been hiking in cool weather all afternoon long that occasionally threatened rain. The shelters I passed earlier looked nice and the Quarry Gap Shelter was beyond nice. The shelter's caretaker has a posted sign welcoming us. Flower containers adorn the shelter area that comes with a bear vault, a bench, and covered picnic tables. I was able to snag one of the final spots in the shelter and Rambo found a covered spot to hang his hammock. We were hoping to get such cover because the forecast calls for 100% rain tonight and tomorrow. Wet gear means extra weight so we avoid having wet sleeping gear if at all possible. We didn't see or hear from Bonnie & Clyde today but Rambo got a message from Blues Brother that he is about 5 days back and is hiking with a good group. Didn't say anything about his knees so that sounded positive. Hiking solo today made for plenty of time to think. My mind seemed concentrated on tomorrow, Day 75 of this hike. Today's destination was just 10 miles short of the actual AT mid-point. If I am lucky enough to finish the AT's second half in another 75 days then I'd be done in exactly 5 months, a very respectable time and one that would nicely align with our annual family vacation. It may seem odd to hear me thinking about such things. I am not wishing away this journey's end. It's just that some of us think about logistics while hiking. There are many prizes in the AT's second half - the White Mountains, the miles shared between the AT and The Long Trail, Maine, and visits or hiking with friends who are now able to travel somewhat smaller distances to enjoy this journey with me. And a secret hope that my upcoming few days off trail for personal celebration will result in my being reunited or at least dramatically closing the mileage gap to consider being able to hike with some of my first half Trail family. There were plenty of smiles today as one thought replaced another. Almost forgot reality - Pennsylvania is expected to bruise my feet and eat up a pair of boots as I make my way over those rock fields. Slow, safe, and steady. The second half is about to begin.","Pen Mar Road in Waynesboro, PA

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530872,"Another rainy day; a bit cold too. But it's official, I crossed the 2016 AT Midpoint today so there are fewer miles ahead of me than those already hiked. It feels good, real good.     Today's trail was comparatively easy. There are going to be climbs and descents everyday but most of today's trail consisted of dirt, sand, or soft pine needles. My knees love these types of trails but I still am not able to hike as quickly as I was hiking a few weeks ago. There's probably a lesson there that I am evading.     I began hiking at 6:30 and finished around 3:00. I hiked with the intent of reaching Pine Grove Furnace before the AT Museum there closed at 4:00. The museum was interesting and full of memorabilia about the AT, including stories and photos about the legendary people who originally hiked the trail and those who made their dreams of the trail become a reality.    Crossing the AT Midpoint was an important milestone. It enabled consideration of the 1/2 Gallon Challenge with the opportunity to become a member of the 1/2 Gallon Club. The challenge consists of eating 1/2 gallon of ice cream. Most that know me for any length of time know that I love ice cream. My parents started this many years ago when they'd provide huge bowls of ice cream. In high school, I'd take my youngest sister, Sherrie, with me when I was lucky enough to take a cerrtain young lady I was particularly fond of for ice cream. Back then I was capable of eating a pint without any problem. Today? Nothing, not even an ice cream cone. I was cold as I came off the trail and was anxious to eat anything to warm me up.    Thanks to the anonymous trail angel who left Gatorades in a shallow stream before the Toms Run Shelter.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531103,"Long day today. I had a tough night's sleep last night as the room temperature kept getting hotter. Figured I was so uncomfortable that I might as well get organized and start hiking. So I started hiking at 6:00 when I could hike without my headlamp. Initially it was hard to differentiate tree rain from falling rain. Fortunately, the rain stopped before noon. The trail all day had few rocks so it was easy on the knees. Most of the trail was flat and the climbs that were encountered were comparatively easy. This combination enabled hiking many miles today.I was concerned after reading about two rock mazes. I didn't recall seeing such references before and thought Rocksylvania was about to crush me. The first rock maze eliminated my concern. These really were mazes and were not rock scrambles that will soon be encountered. The first rock maze was fun. It took me up and around huge boulders. There was a step or two that required pulling myself up with my hands though a younger, stronger hiker probably would've just quickly lept up and through. The maze seemed like something I'd pay to go through and enjoy. The second rock maze came in less than a quarter mile. It seemed a bit harder and longer than the first. There was a somewhat steep descent after the mazes but I found a big grin on my face thinking how this trail is so full of surprises. Who would've ever thought such fun could be found using mountainous terrain. Then I thought how much fun youngsters would have playing hide and seek here in addition to scrambling through them. A father approached with two little ones and I told him I knew a couple young boys who were about to have a fun time. The dad said he lived in Boiling Springs and had enjoyed them himself numerous times before and was taking these little ones for their second time. People living in this area have a real treat awaiting them and I wondered how many know what they have here.Yesterday's song title choice led to a question from Andy. The song, Look On The Bright Side Of Life, comes from Monty Python and probably isn't that well known since many either love or hate Monty Python. Coincidentally, I began eating Spam about a week ago. Monty Python does a hilarity segment on Spam and I suspect Doug and Tom are now replaying that in their minds now.After the mazes I was challenged to live through yesterday's song title when one of my brand new hiking poles began to fail. The hiking pole came apart after being placed in sticky mud. The bottom portion of the pole remained planted in the ground as I'd continue to hike, then I'd attempt to plant it with my next step and realize that the bottom portion of the pole wasn't there. I carried the pole after doing this a dozen times and not being able to fix the pole. Don't think these poles lasted 3 weeks and yet they have a three year warranty. Look On The Side Of Life - yup, walk the walk and walk the talk.Just as I was about to walk through a cornfield, I came upon a young family happily hiking along. The Dad (Red Wing) originally thru-hiked in 1999 and then he and his wife (Hopeful) thru-hiked together in 2005. I answered a few questions and learned that their oldest child, who seemed very young, hiked over 200 miles last year. This young hiker had two siblings hiking while Mom carried her younger sibling in a baby hiking carrier. Wonder when this family will thru-hike. It seems inevitable. As I walked away, I could hear the Dad telling his family about his thru-hike experience.Lots of fun and smiles today as the miles flew by.","Pine Grove Furnace - Ironmasters Mansion Hostel

Today's hike was to Duncannon where two of Beth's and my closest friends (Barb & Rob Hughes) were driving way out of their way to take me to dinner. Normally the ""prize""'of the day is a phenomenal view or a unique AT feature. Today it was all about people. People brought together by this fabulous trail. I do see Barb and Rob a couple times a year now but this is a one-of-a-kind visit. Beth and I have known Rob since my first job after college. After we married, we moved to an apartment complex to be close to him and then when we moved to another complex, he moved to the same complex to be with us. We can rattle off the tv shows we faithfully watched together and can relive some past moments in great detail. I can recall first hearing about Barb and getting a before and after accounting of their initial dates. Special people in our lives. The morning's hike began with dry clothes and it wasn't raining. I put on my rain gear though figuring there tree rain would fall. No tree rain though so off came the rain gear. I didn't expect the pasture walking. The path through the pasture was narrow. Rambo had warned me about cows in the field but they were far away. The surprise here was last night's rain. The pasture was very wet and soon my socks and trailrunners were soaked. ""Squish, squish"" was this morning's song.I met a group of hikers who recently began their hikes in Harpers Ferry. First it was Morning Song (isn't that a beautiful trail name, then Ziptie, then Nibbles and Cookie, and then Shoelace and Captain Jack. Later at dinner, I met Malachite and Misty. Most of these were in a bubble. They didn't know each other before their hikes began. Great group. Easily engaged and fun to speak with. Ziptie and I talked for a few minutes about trail legs and some initial concerns she had about miles per day. I did my best to change her focus to ""fun on the trail"" and let the miles come later. It felt like our conversation was helpful - hope it was. A beautiful moment came shortly after speaking with Ziptie. Two white-tailed hawks flew ahead in plain view. No picture of this but I tried to store it in my memory bank. They were simultaneously powerful and effortless as they flew. In a blink they were gone, but their moment was a real treat.Pennsylvania's rocks surfaced 6.6 miles before Duncannon. Nothing that hasn't been seen before just a lot of them. So the pace was slower than the initial 11 miles that were hiked in 2.5 miles per hour, which is fast for me. I mistakenly missed a right turn near the bottom of the descent into Duncannon. Purist that I am, I found the trail and went back up in order to get back to the missed turn. Shoelace and Captain Jack were initially confused as I approached them but understood once I told them about my mistake. Hey, it's been a while since I did this. Always good to give someone a laugh at the end of the day. Rambo had gotten a double room for us at the legendary Doyle Hotel. I fell hard for the Doyle's Vicky. She began kidding me about being a purist (Shoelace or Captain Jack must have told her about my missed turn and my hiking back to walk past each white blaze of the trail. The banter with Vicky was so warm and funny. In some ways I wish I was taking a zero day here tomorrow just to enjoy talking with her more. The Doyle - don't miss it.Dinner with Barb and Rob was over too quickly. Visits with friends like these often leave me wanting more. When I say ""more"", I mean ""talking time"", not trail magic goodies. I wouldn't be able to lift my backpack if I were to take all the food they brought. The good news is that there are plenty of hikers here who will enjoy their kindness tomorrow morning. For me, I get to go to sleep thinking about friends, just like I did all day.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531418,"Just a few miles today. The shelters seem to be spread differently here. Given today's rain and the forecast for more rain tomorrow, I couldn't envision a 27.5 mile hike which was my only other shelter option. Rambo and I hiked out of Duncannon at 8:00 with full bellies from all the food my trail angel friends Barb & Rob left with me last night. I left a good bit of trail magic behind for those hikers who were taking a zero day at the Doyle Hotel. There must be a story to explain why the AT runs through a neighborhood street in Duncannon. It seemed odd but we followed the white blazes. The trail then goes across a bridge over the Susquehanna River and multiple railroad tracks before taking us into the woods. The climb wasn't that difficult and began an extended ridge walk. The rain created a colder than normal environment as I couldn't hike fast enough while selecting my steps on the ridge to generate enough heat to stay warm.  This morning's sounds were unusual too. Trains could be heard along with cars driving on wet roads. The woods kept these sounds out of sight but they were heard for the better part of the morning. Last night's visit with Barb and Rob was very much in my thoughts this morning. An opening appreared ahead and gave me a look at a road just as some school students were getting out of a van. I hiked around as the teacher gave his students their field trip instructions. But then he called me over and asked if I was thru-hiking. ""Cool! That's neat."" were the initial responses to my reply. Before you knew it I was answering questions as the teacher asked the students to gather around me for a picture. I apparently became a part of today's field trip. Since they asked for a picture with me, I asked for a picture with them. This was the 5th Grade class from Hanover School. The school has been doing this trip for 48 years. They were taking another path so we parted company. The final comment heard was ""I hope you make it."" The trail took me out to view the valley below, but no views were available because of the rain. The AT then joined a wider path and I wondered if it was the class's path. A bit later another teacher came my way with his students and he greeted me with ""You must be Rabbit."" This teacher also wanted a picture of his class with me and while that picture was being set up, I asked if anyone had any questions. The students had lots of questions and it was cute how hands went up awaiting my calling on those who raised their hands. We parted ways after the questions were answered. Then came the original class and I could hear ""there's that guy"" as they approached. We just passed each other this time with many smiling and giving me various encouraging remarks. A third group arrived just as I snapped a photo at Table Rock. These students were from a different school and it wasn't until the end of their line before the teacher at the end of the line asked if I was thru-hiking. My response led to his stopping to speak with me and the two students in front of him stopped too. They each got bigger and bigger smiles on their faces as I answered their questions. When it was time for their class outing picture, I headed back to the trail. With so few miles being hiked today, I arrived at the shelter unusually early. First business was placing a call about my troublesome hiking poles. The company representative couldn't have been nicer. She is shipping replacement poles to my home and I can return my troublesome poles at a time of my convenience. I then ate and began planning my hikes for the next 2 days when Beth arrives and then for a period up to two weeks from now when I'll be off the AT for a few days. Planning is a bit hard because I don't know how the fabled Pennsylvania rocks will impact my pace. If students could greet me along the way like they did today then my pace would be just fine because they lifted me up and I just glided along after they went by.","Duncannon - Doyle Hotel

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531598,"No rain today while I was hiking. That was a pleasant change. The temperature continued to be cool. The combination made for good hiking weather. The trail was still easy but had more stones or rocks interspersed between crushed stone or dirt. Am sure strong hikers could move through this trail pretty quickly, much faster than I did. There was an 1,100 foot climb in the morning with much of it on what seemed to be a very old road of some sort. Aside from the hikers at last night's shelter, I didn't see anyone until the middle of the afternoon. Replacing the hikers were continual greetings from unseen birds on the left and right of the AT. It was kind of amazing. Birds often land yards in front of me and then fly ahead to keep distance from me as I hike forward. Today's hike lacked bird or butterfly sightings but the birds seemed to be everywhere. This trail also was clearly cut between long sections of massive Boulder fields seen on the path's right and left. Again, it seemed the trail had a long history whose story I wish was explained as I walked by. Someone cleared those rock fields on this path and I wondered how long ago such work was done.Five young Amish women from Lancaster County were out for a couple nights hiking south. They had questions about thru-hiking. Soon after they passed, I came upon Mr. Nature, a northbound flip-flopper from California. He is ex-Army and was interesting and easy to speak with. His destination today was the same as mine, another six miles ahead. Then it was lucky me. Before I knew it, he was telling me that his wife, Susan, was picking him up at our destination and that they'd gladly give me a ride so that I didn't have to hitch or walk an extra two miles to get to Lickdale where I was intending to stay tonight. Susan is supporting Mr. Nature's thru-hike and sounds like she is having fun dispensing trail magic to other hikers too. Susan stays in their RV that are parked in nearby campgrounds. Mr. Nature hikes in 3-day increments and, as it suits him, tents or calls for a pick-up. They shipped their car to the East coast while driving across the country in their RV. Susan drives the car to pick-up Mr. Nature or drives to nearby points of interest to explore this part of the country while Mr. Nature hikes the AT. Susan recently took multiple tours ofGettysburg battlefields and visited Amish too. Mr. Nature's name has an interesting origin. Many years ago while attending a wedding, some of the wedding party's children were thrust upon him to entertain while the parents attended to picture taking. A hike was undertaken and he taught the children about their surroundings. One child coined the name Mr. Nature and that became his name as the other children asked questions during the hike. Those children now are older with children of their own. Upon hearing of his plan to hike the AT, he was contacted with the idea of embracing the name they had given him many years ago. Love hiking with story tellers like Mr. Nature because I learn so much in such an easy, carefree way. The trail lends itself to all of this while all I have to do is put one foot in front of the other.","Peters Mountain Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531765,"The rain continued today. Fortunately also continuing was the kindness extended by Mr. Nature, who picked me up and drove me to resume my hike. Don't know if I'll see him again but I'll be able to follow his progress through Susan's blog at wifeonthetrail.com. Today's hike began with a 900' climb. Most of the climb's elevation was steep but quite manageable since it came at the beginning of the hike. The first half of today' hike was rockier than the last few days. Within that first half was a boulder field that was all the more challenging because of the rain. Some of the boulders wobbled and made for interesting moments until I realized I wasn't about to fall one way or another. I think today is the last day of Pennsylvania's easier hiking and I expect to see more challenging boulder fields in the coming days. The second half today was shockingly easy as the trail was on what appeared to have previously been a road of some sort. Now it was grassy with the only challenge being the puddles. A couple puddles were more like lakes since they were twenty feet long and stretching across the trail's width. Nothing to do but embrace what's there but being ankle-deep in cold water again put me to the test of that ""Bright Side Of Life"" theme. Since I was soaked I doubted that anyone would pick me up as a hitchhiker so I called Carlin's AT Shuttle Service and paid Lance $15 to drive me into Pine Grove where Beth is meeting me. While waiting 10 minutes for Lance to arrive, a car pulled up and a powerful looking bull dog jumped out and came straight at me. It was barking in a nasty way just a couple feet away from me when the driver finally got out of his car and said the dog had never behaved like that before. The driver got frustrated with the dog and started to drive away leaving the dog too close to me. The driver apparently had played this out with his dog before and finally left. Seems a bit ironic that one of my most troubled times of this journey comes when I am mixing with non-hikers.Beth arrived safely and brought with her my resupply items so that I am ready to hike out tomorrow morning. Beth's support continues to be incredible. In many ways I think my task is easier - one foot in front of the other and don't fall down doing it.","Swatara Gap - Lickdale, PA

This was a very quick visit that was made possible because the drive is now less than 5 hours - still a very long time, but it gets shorter with each week's hikes. Beth thinks I'm walking much easier now and I think I am too. No rain today but yesterday's rainfall was evident. There was a four mile section in which most of the trail was under water. In some places the water was flowing so quickly that it was easy to hear gurgling sounds typically heard in legitimate streams. The trail was still relatively easy. Rocks are increasingly becoming the trail and there were a couple rock scrambles but today's hike was easier than expected.Saw Mr. Nature again along with hikers I met yesterday in the hotel - Stumble Toes and Velcro. Spent time at dinner tonight talking with Good Doctor. He's hiked in Nepal and hiked to Mt. Everest base camp; places that my son has been as part of his research.Not much else going on today. Replaced my trailrunners with boots and I think the boots helped absorb the impact of hiking on so many angled rocks.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532096,"Happy Mother's Day! I can hear Beth now saying ""I'm not your mother."" My Mom was the focus of my thoughts today. It seemed very appropriate that today's hike included a very steep climb to get to Pulpit Rock, where the views were expansive. I've always jokingly thought my Mom came over as one of the original Pilgrims. She wanted Sunday to be the day of rest; today's 23.8 miles surely wasn't that. But she'd have been pleased with a connection of this day's hike being undertaken to enjoy God's creation. My Mom clearly taught me to work hard and to not complain about such work. I worked very hard today. I have felt for many years now how fortunate I was to have my Mom. It wasn't always easy being her son, but moments of goodness that I am proud of are certainly traced to her and how she raised me. Another reason why I am a lucky guy.I was awakened by a loud clap of thunder. Then I heard rain coming down pretty hard. It convinced me to roll over for a few more minutes of sleep, but then I realized that sleeping wasn't going to get today's hike done so I began to get up shortly thereafter. The rain stopped before I was ready to leave and the day's weather just got better as the day went on. The hike started with more of yesterday's trail puddles except that the puddles weren't as deep or as long. The trail was flat and initially made for some ""fast"" hiking (at least it was fast for me.) I wanted to hike more miles than usual today and knew I'd be hiking until near sunset to get those miles in. Temptation came as I arrived in Port Clinton. A family was waiting across the road and seemed to be agitated that a door wasn't open. Someone then opened that door and after the family went in I asked if food was served there. I didn't realize that Port Clinton Hotel had a restaurant. I went in and waited to be seated. I think my being a ""clean"" looking hiker paid off as I overheard a waitress say that ""a hiker walked in and that she seated him."" I don't know what would've happened if I came in with a haggard look as sometimes happens after a day's hiking is over. The burger and fries were as good as anything eaten on the AT so far. Recommend you stop here for food, but be careful to be cleaned up before you arrive. Lunch was a bit slow though and cost me one hour's time. Before resuming my hike, I lingered and purchased some candy at the Peanut Shop next door. There's a nice River walk coming out of Port Clinton. Nice AT graffiti under the overpass too. Then a very steep and very long climb begins and goes on and on for the better part of an hour. Ridge walking is fit in between parts of the climb and there's a rock scramble in the mix too before the final part of this climb is completed. While my stomach was full and I was happy about that, I knew that this day's hike might be even longer than I'd expected. I ran into Swamp Angel    and Captain Kirk, who were again hiking southbound just as I had seen them hiking yesterday. They do a very interesting two-car aided slack pack hike that results in them enjoying good meals and not camping at the end of each day. Holcomb describes their hiking process nicely in his May 6th trailjournal post if you want to understand their process. I really think such a process enables hiking the AT for people who like to hike but don't want to camp. Rocketman and Princess also are doing this, in a different way, and they post entries in trailjournals too. Today's hike has long sections of dirt-based trail that I really didn't expect to see in Pennsylvania. But just as I got going and got used to such trail, I found myself in another rock scramble. Today's hike seemed to have a bit of everything in it. Easy road-path walking was the trail around Windsor Furnace and there were many people out enjoying the great weather and outdoors. Lots of questions as I walked by but the questions were easily answered as I kept hiking. The climb up Pulpit Rock was steep and it finished with steep boulder climbing too. That's when I did have a prolonged conversation with a couple whose husband asked many questions and expressed interest in hiking the entire AT.The views from Pulpit Rock were far reaching. I easily could've spent more time there and it would be a perfect place to stop for a rest break to eat. I didn't have such time available so I kept moving. Then came another significant rock scramble that slowed me down so that I didn't hurt myself with a fall. Time was really getting eaten up now and I sensed I might be doing some night hiking before today was done. I briefly lost the trail at the Pinnacle. I missed the hairpin left turn and really don't understand the trail's routing here, except that it's there to probably take you to a place where the blue-blaze Pinnacle is more readily available. Lucky for me, the descent to Eckville Shelter has miles of road-path hiking so I moved as quickly as I could to give me a chance to get to Eckville Shelter in light. The shelter is literally on Hawk Mountain Road so don't cross the road expecting to find the shelter in the woods, where most shelters are. There isn't a sign directing you to the shelter so careful about getting to it. I met Chill Lax as I arrived one hour before sunset. The shelter has room for six so I got a nice bunk with padding which will make for nice sleeping conditions. The shelter has a flush toilet and a door that closes the shelter sleeping quarters. There are tables and a water spigot. Lots of nicely cut grass to dry out wet gear too. This is a great shelter if it fits into your hike for the day. Long day today with many challenges. It all seems appropriate on Mother's Day as I'm sure I gave plenty of challenges to my Mom as she raised me.","Eagles Nest Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532235,"I arrived in Rocksylvania today. Please get me out of here safely - and quickly. I got crushed today. Honestly, I'd leave the AT if I had to hike this every day.Today's hike started okay. The climb up Hawk Mountain was no big deal. Pennsylvania's stones, rocks, and boulders began in earnest in the climb to Dan's Pulpit. There were numerous rock scrambles between Dan's Pulpit and the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter, a distance slightly over 4 miles. Swamp Angel and Captain Kirk were on the trail hiking southbound and I confessed that the AT had gotten the better of me today. They told me it was easy hiking to Blue Mountain Summit, a distance of 4.5 miles and they were right. It was easy. I stopped at Blue Mountain Summit Bed & Breakfast but it was closed. The AWOL guide book says they allow their water spigot to be used so I drank my water and refilled two liters. Water is scarce around here and this water didn't require much of a hike to get it. Hiking after Blue Mountain Summit was easy until the New Tripoli Campsite so I had another easy two miles to get there. Then my day changed badly. I didn't expect Knife Edge to be the challenge that it was. My fear of ledges and heights took over and I didn't recover until today's hike was over. Knife Edge required hiking on slanted boulders. Fall to the right and you are in a lot of pain, assuming you are alive or able to feel pain. A fall here conceivably could lead to major agony. I lost my confidence when my hiking pole slipped, resulting in me hugging the slanted rock. No injury except that I was shook to the point that I moved at a snail's pace. I was fine with hiking slowly. I didn't want to fall. I was grateful when this section was done. No Schedule is ex-Air Force and he got dizzy with vertigo while he was on Knife Edge. He said he was more afraid there then when he was being shot at. I confessed that I was hiking on my butt for part of it. Misery loves company and we were both miserable today. The trail was easy again after Knife Edge and Bear Rocks. Easy until Bake Oven Knob when the boulder hopping returns, but this part was easy compared to Knife Edge.I am safely in a shelter tonight. I am grateful to be here and in one piece. I need a good night's rest to put this day behind me.","Eckville Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532439,"I have been dreading today's Superfund Trail hike. It looked so steep and some previous trailjournal accounts of the climb intimidated me. Given yesterday's difficult experience with Knife Edge, I was more than concerned but began today with a ""new day"" perspective to take on the challenge. Today, to my surprise, was challenging and fun compared to yesterday's challenging and scary. The hike before the Superfund Trail climb had a couple boulder fields but was pretty easy with stoney trail that was walkable. The Superfund Trail was steep and required work. Yes, I was on my butt at times, okay it was a number of times. I'm sure most hikers would be upright but I was satisfied to get through it enjoyably. There was no time that I felt like I was at risk.Tonight I am at Mechanical Man's home, the Stempa home. We are in the garage and enjoying it. Here with me are Birk (who is recovering here with a leg problem) and a group of 5 who started from Harpers Ferry. The 5 get along great and it was fun to be with them as they laughed and sang. Two are from Switzerland, Mountain Man & Karma. The other three (Bubbles, Sprout, & Smudgy Cheeks) are from Ohio and they hope to finish their flip-flop in November. I saw a video of Sprout walking up to cows and waving them away - I need him to hike with me! They were more entertaining than last night when I had the shelter to myself. Or thought I was by myself. There's a picture of a late-arriving visitor - an ugly porcupine who was gnawing on the shelter's wood just 10 feet away from me. This porcupine wasn't easily moved but eventually left after I banged hiking poles for a while. I was happy today and hugged the rocks like David recommended in his comment. There's a saying that warns hikers not to fight the AT. Embracing the AT today was enabled by the AT showing kindness on this hiker. Thank goodness.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532731,"Happy Birthday Anne! My thinking and experience is that first born children have it tougher than younger siblings while parents learn to be parents. I recall Anne pointing that out to David a time or two. There are benefits too. Anne was my Mom's first grandchild and brought a sparkle to her eye that never went away. I have two terrific children. If someone wrote a definition of why I am a lucky man then having these two would be at the top of the list along with sharing them and their lives with their Mom. The trail doesn't always make it easy either. I was told that the worst of Pennsylvania's rocks are behind me and that seemed to be the case today. But rocks are rocks and easy isn't a word I can use to describe today's trail. The first rock scramble climb came less than a half hour into today's hike. Then the trail messed with me as it was level and extensively dirt-based. Scenarios involving being able to hike more miles today were running through my head and then another rocky sequence appeared. These rocks weren't as difficult as those of the last two days, but they were enough of a problem to slow me down and crush those bigger mile scenarios. Captain Kirk and Swamp Angel came by with Captain Kirk mentioning Groundhog Day since we've been encountering each other like this the last few days. We exchanged perspectives on yesterday's hikes, what we'd each hiked through today, and what we expected later in the day. I am going to miss these conversations when I go off the trail for a few days next week. I saw Swiss Miss again today too. She provided a glazed donut that was trail magic from a friend of Waffles who was hiking with her yesterday after hiking the AT for the last thirty days. Swiss Miss has 65 days remaining on her Visa. It seems we're both hoping to finish in similar time frames. These on-the-trail conversations are important to me since I'm currently hiking alone.  The trail is meandering through woodlands. Birds are singing all the time. Bumble bees are frequently seen. But other wildlife seems to be hiding.  Enjoying the trail right now comes with fewer miles. It is hard to face that reality but that's where I am at right now in Pennsylvania. Today's weather was great and the trail is dry while the water sources are all flowing. Hiking the AT means accepting what you can't control or change. Seems easier taking that approach.","Little Gap - Stempa Home Of Mechanical Man

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532929,"Stepping outside this morning, you could just feel how nice it was going to be today. The window of the taxi was down a bit as I was driven to the AT trail. The wind felt great and it reminded me of this simple pleasure that I haven't had in years because I'm so spoiled and use air conditioning without considering being cooled by the window. I was feeling great. Today's hike had a destination just over 15 miles away so it would be a relatively easy day. Rambo and I had exchanged messages and I learned that he's now hiking 25 miles a day with Scrappy, a strong hiker from Texas that we'd met a couple weeks ago. Rambo's plan to finish in June is possible if he continues to hike those miles each day. I was happy for him. Subman and I exchanged messages too. Subman and Suds are headed to Damascus for Trail Days, a multi-day event held annually that celebrates the AT with thousands of hikers attending. It's a great time to visit with people you met on the trail and to get gear give-aways from numerous gear vendors.  But I was feeling so good because of the news that arrived last night right after yesterday's journal was posted. Anne & Pat are engaged! Pat had called to ask for our blessing a couple days earlier so I thought he might propose on Anne's birthday and he did. My call with Anne was brief but the excitement in her voice was unmistakable. Such joy. Pat is a good guy and he makes Anne so happy. Pat and his Dad did a day hike involving Massachusetts' Mt Greylock last year. I remember Pat asking about 1.5 hours into the hike if we were half-way done. I never learned where the confusion came in but remember us laughing as he learned that our hike had just started and that we'd be hiking many hours more. And then I missed a turn and we ended up hiking an extra couple miles. No complaints were heard and we've enjoyed getting to know him many times since. Great news that I smiled about all day long.  Today's hike began with a reasonably steep climb out of Wind Gap. The rock scramble was of the fun variety with a somewhat easy boulder path. Then it was typical Pennsylvania trail with plenty of rocks continuing to challenge and deny an easy cadence. The day got even better as Captain Kirk and Swamp Angel came my way so that I could hear about their Lehigh Gap descent hiked yesterday. I've thoroughly enjoyed these trail chats that have become something like a mid-morning break. Then Waterfall arrived hiking south. She began in New York and spoke of the upcoming good trail in New Jersey and New York. That was good news because earlier in the day I read a nice message from RC Slowpoke alerting me that those states had rocks too. Great people out here on the trail. Wolf Rocks was fun and consisted of navigating large boulders. The trail became very easy after that. There's a long walk on a road that hasn't been used in so many years that it now is primarily grass. The walk goes all the way up to Mt Minsi that arrives as the road ends. Future hikers of this section don't need to pay attention to finding the white blazes and can just enjoy this trail. Just make sure you look for the unmarked side trail that provides a great first look at the Delaware River. Bubbles gave me a big smile as I approached her and we descended into Delaware Water Gap together. It was great to spend time getting to know her. She was one of the fun group of hikers that I met a couple days ago at Mechanical Man's home.  A elderly hiker quickly came out of a covered turn just before I met up with Bubbles.

Knowing that she'll pick me up for a several day break mid-week made saying goodbye easier. Started hiking around 6:30 and was quickly at the PA/NJ Border on the Delaware River Bridge. Enjoyed seeing a couple men fishing as their boat went up the Delaware River. Once off the bridge, the trail is within a park. The park has a beautiful, wide trail that I hiked without seeing anyone for a couple hours. It was a special time. The PA rocks were long gone but the songbirds weren't and they provided sounds along the way as the sun danced between the trees. Just before the first campsite is a short side trail that has more than a hundred rock cairn sculptures. Thanks to all who made them. Backpacker Campsite at Mile 1,298 is stunning and would be a wonderful place to camp.  Sunfish Pond arrives one mile later as this morning's beautiful trail continues to amaze. Sunfish Pond is a glacial lake and it seems that I have it all to myself as the trail follows its banks. Near thenorth end of Sunfish Pond, Candle Maker joins me and we hiked together for the next several hours.  Candle Maker is someone I first met in Damascus. We've had short conversations along the AT as we've leapfrogged numerous times because Candle Maker has taken a few offtrail days here and there. It's our first time spending time to get to know each other and I consider it a real compliment that he is slowing down to hike with me. I learn that he is 22 and from Holland, Michigan. He's targeting completion for mid-July but knows he could finish before then. Sounds like his Mom and then a few friends may be coming to hike some portions of the northern trail. His trail name was given based on his overnight at Blood Mountain Shelter. He used a candle he had found to ward off the mice and rats in that shelter. Mice are common in shelters though I have had surprisingly few encounters with them despite staying many nights in shelters. I've never seen a rat and this is the first time I am hearing about them in a shelter. I wouldn't like having a rat around and Candle Maker heard them get busy as soon as his candle went out around 3:00 that night. It didn't sound like he got much sleep the night he got his trail name.  The trail becomes busier as we hike near Mohican Outdoor Center. Lots of hikers here. One group stops and we talk briefly how we decided to hike the AT. One woman said she's just hiked a few miles and I laugh to warn that I started that way too. Another group of three go out of their way to ask if we are thru-hikers. They provide fruit and goodies as trail magic and we stop to talk for a few minutes. They are seasoned hikers preparing for their next hikes. Everest must have gotten her trail name because she's hiked to Mt. Everest base camp and I tell her that my son, David, has hiked there too. The good vibes come to an end with the recognition that there's a storm forecast for later today. We hear it could bring hail with it and it sets up next few hours to try to hike to our day's destination that is still more than 10 miles away.  The later afternoon trail is rockier than this morning's trail. Still, it is easier trail than the PA trail because there are options to hike around the rocks. PA trail is so filled with rocks that your choices involve which rocks you'll place your feet on and which angles your feet will experience. Around 4:00 I am about 2 miles away from the shelter and it seems the storm is arriving. Wind gusts are frequent. Candle Maker had taken off to beat the weather but shows up behind me because he got water from a spring. The trail crosses multiple summits now, exactly where I don't want to be in a storm. Fortunately for me, the storm never arrives and I reach the shelter reasonably dry. Better yet, there's room for me in the shelter. It's just 3 nice college students, Candle Maker, and me.

I mistakenly thought that the relatively low elevations would result in a lack of views. I was wrong. There were many miles today with views galore.  My trailside chat with Swamp Angel and Captain Kirk resumed today. I was happy to see them again. There were fewer weekend hikers today and conversation was rare, probably because everyone wanted to keep hiking to stay warm. The trail started off being very easy but became rockier in the afternoon. I found myself eating whatever I could today in order to keep my energy level up. I'm assuming I felt the need to eat more because of the cooler weather. With the temperature forecasted to be near or below freezing tonight, I decided to get into a hotel.

Candle Maker received awesome trail magic yesterday as he was invited to spend the night in the home of a couple who he met at yesterday's shelter. The couple fed him, gave him a warm place to sleep on yesterday's freezing night, gave him a 1.5 hour canoe ride, and then returned him to the trail this morning. We moved through flat trail quickly. We stopped to let me gather myself after I fell. I stubbed my toe on a downhill and went flying. Nothing hurt. This was my first fall witnessed by someone and it must've made him concerned as he quickly came to offer me help. I fell on smooth trail and told him I've had at least a few falls worse than this. So we hiked on and came to trail magic in the form of a plastic container that was filled with water and an apple for both of us. Thanks to our anonymous trail angel! The walk around the Wallikill swamp was enjoyable. Candle Maker has good eyes and spotted a beaver, a beautiful bird, and a small snake. We hiked separately as we began to climb Pochunk Mountain. This mountain didn't look like much of a climb in AWOL's guide but I found it to be more tiring than expected. After this mountain came several ups and downs that also hadn't been anticipated based on the guide. Along the trail were various boardwalks over swampy areas.  The Pochunk Creek boardwalk was a unique walk for almost a mile. Many people were out to enjoy this walk. A place one man called Turtle Bridge was particularly interesting and I easily counted twenty turtles basking in the day's sunlight. This walk's finish was through a pasture with a good number of cows. A couple young women were ahead of me and they went right up to the cows and were snapping selfies. Given their experience this walk through the cows was easy for me too. Today's main event came next. A substantial climb up boulders and rock steps. Climbs near the end of the day when I'm already tired are never easy and that was the case today. It was steep and took me an hour to finish it but it was very satisfying after it was done. Today's hike ended with more easy trail, trail that was now displayed in filtered sunlight and with a cooling temperature. It made for a nice finish to a long day of hiking.  I was stunned by the number of hikers at the Wawayanda Shelter. Nobody had passed me so seeing at least a dozen hikers here was a shock. The only thru-hikers here were Candle Maker, me, and Bookworm, who I haven't seen for a couple weeks. The new hikers were easy to speak with. Standouts were John Henry, who played his guitar. He's from Utah and is resuming his AT section hike after suffering a heart attack off-trail a few years ago. Rose, a young daughter who began hiking with her Dad today, is from Canada. She just quit her airplane stewardess job to hike for a couple weeks. Then came POZ. It brought smiles to both of our faces when we realized that we live twenty minutes apart (he lives in East Granby).  Great day today. Candle Maker is easy to talk with and we enjoyed reminiscing about Fresh Ground several times today. Tonight's shelter has a couple of the loudest snorers I've come across so far. It could be a fairly sleepless night but I have so many good moments of today's hike to think about that I'm hopeful that my sleep come easily.","NJ 23 - High Point State Park Headquarters

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533723,"Wow! I left New Jersey by 8:30 this morning and entered New York. The difficulty of today's hike isn't easily described so I'll use the words of others. At the bottom of today's page (135) in AWOL's Guide - ""Despite the unimposing profile, rocks, abrupt ups and downs make this section challenging."" Then there was John Henry's comment near the end of today's hike - ""They have many signs asking you to help their restoration efforts by staying on the trail, but they appear to not want to show you where the trail is."" Today's hike was schizophrenic. One minute there's a peace that comes with hiking by a pond or a lake and then the next minute there's a battle to find the trail as I was looking for any path up the imposing boulders in front of me. Other trailjournal entries by Holcomb and Rocketman and Princess today cover portions of my hike today. I was heartened to read that I wasn't the only one who found these miles challenging, exhausting, and, in some cases, dangerous. I expected the difficult climbs of Eastern Pinnacles and Cat Rocks. Those climbs were challenging but were manageable as I slowly hiked them. I didn't expect the difficulty encountered with Mombasha High Point and Buchanan Mountain. Buchanan Mountain was one of a few places today that I strained to find the trail. At that moment of confusion, I was confronted with very steep options and I didn't want to mistakenly climb only to have to then have to descend such a difficult path if I mistakenly pursued a course that wasn't the AT.  In hindsight, I attempted too many miles today for my capabilities. I hoped to hike to NY 17 but shortened today's hike because I only had two hours of daylight left to cover the last couple of miles. I found myself very concerned about the potential difficult terrain of Arden Mountain and wanted no part of that mountain today. I can't recall feeling this way at any prior time.  This is not to say that there weren't some sections with white blazes clearly identifying the trail. Because 95% of today's hike was clearly identified or at least had blazes on trees or rocks. There was actually a timeless two late in the hike that I began feeling that the presence of a white blaze meant the trail was around there somewhere versus my past experience that the presence of a blaze meant the trail was within close proximity and directionally aligned with that blaze.So did I enjoy today? Yes! The sense of accomplishment of climbing and descending today's trail wasn't overcome by the trail's blazing challenges. The diversity of today's trail was remarkable with ponds, a pretty waterfall (Fitzgerald Falls), a couple of lakes that were either walked around or bridged by boulder steps, in addition to portions of park-like walking trail, and then multiple boulder scrambles. Today also included climbing to find an anchored American Flag that was flying proudly in a brisk wind and being quiet enough not to spook a doe who was hiding 25 yards off the trail. Doing this while hiking solo but then sharing a few moments near the day's end to discuss this with Candle Maker and John Henry rounded out the day nicely. Tired at the end and a bit disappointed to not reach my goal for today. But grateful to have been here today. And that reminds me of one of the very few other hikers I saw today. He was interested in my hike and wished me well. After we passed each other, he asked me for my trail name and I then asked for his - his was ""Grateful"".","Wawayanda Sheler

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534094,"I am writing this one day after the hike I am writing about now. I am now in my home. Comfortable and far away from the AT. It's an odd feeling.  The hike began with a climb up Arden Mountain. The climb came in layers and reminded me of a wedding cake but maybe that's just because my daughter's wedding plans are on my mind. The climb was steep in places but it was consistently blazed. The hike flattened out after the climb and then the climb resumed. This sequence repeated itself several times. The weather was beautiful for hiking and today began much better than the way yesterday ended.  The Lemon Squeezer was encountered next. It is very narrow but I inched through it with my backpack on. I didn't expect what was coming just yards after it. There was a rock wall approximately 8 to 10 feet tall. I looked at it a couple times in disbelief. I had seen a blue blaze alternative trail but I've chosen to hike white blazes only. I momentarily thought my hike might be over because I really thought I might not be able to get up and over this wall. I reached up and placed my hiking poles above the wall. Then I took my backpack off and placed it above the wall too.Then I went to the right corner of the wall and found a couple hand-holds to give me the opportunity to rock and lean in and up in order to pull myself above the rock wall. Much to my relief, it was over in a few minutes and I was glad to see flat trail ahead. Weird though how my hike can be moving along and all of a sudden I'm wondering if I can overcome the AT's next difficult challenge.  Black Mountain provided a view of the New York City skyline. It was hazy but the outline was there and was great to see. Moments before that skyline view, a 4 to 5 foot black snake vacated the trail, much to my relief. The Palisades Parkway traffic grew louder during the descent from Black Mountain. Beth came to the Visitor Center and we headed home. This will be my longest planned break as Beth and I are celebrating our son's graduation event. I hope to eat plenty of food and come back a bit stronger than I am at the moment. Plans have been made to visit with family and friends too. It's been a little over 3 months since I was home. Should be fun and interesting, just like this trail.","Orange Turnpike

Then it took a while to sort through previously purchased trail food and then going to stores to purchase food for the next 20 days. A quick haircut to was needed to clean me up a bit. I sure am gray. But the big event for today came near the end of the day when Anne and Pat came to preview wedding reception venues. This is an exciting and hectic time. Initially we were visiting just one but we were so close to others in the area that we saw three - and I think one of them will be selected soon.

There are many great places coming up but my notes remind me of how challenging this part of the trail is too. David and Leigh met us at the airport. We haven't seen David since Christmas and this is our first time meeting Leigh. She's delightful. The two of them seem very happy. Our first stop was to my favorite place in Austin - Sno-Beach - where I got a banana/blueberry shaved ice dessert. What a way to start. We then had dinner at Uncle Billy's. The food and vibe in Austin is vibrant. We ended the night playing one of our favorite games - Ticket To Ride. It is a game we play at a pace that let's us talk with each other as we play.

As soon as we were home, purchasing trail food, spraying hiking clothes with permethrin, and tweaking gear were the priorities in preparation for tomorrow's return to the AT.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534672,"Beth was ready to take me back to the AT before I was packed and ready to go. The transition home seemed much easier than the transition to resume hiking. There's so much space to spread gear and food out at home. It is a lot easier to be organized on the trail when space is shared and possessions are those being worn or carried on my back. Now that I'm less than 3 hours from home, I'll see Beth soon. But being with her for more than 4 consecutive days made it hard to leave. As she waved goodbye and turned the corner driving away, embracing the trail came easier with each passing moment. A trail register log was located between the divided 4-lane Palisades Parkway. I was happy to see that Bubbles and Sprout has signed the register earlier today. Mountain Man and Karma signed in today too. Less than 15 minutes in today's hike, Bubbles called my name. What a break! I'm sharing a beautiful shelter that overlooks the Hudson River with all of them and just them. Since it was just ""us"", we could talk as easily as if we were in a room at home. Talking for this group inevitably leads to singing a tune and laughing. Sprout made a nice fire and tended it until hiker midnight. The fire kept the bugs away and we enjoyed the view of the Hudson River below. It periodically rained lightly and we were treated to half of a rainbow. As darkness came, New York's lights surfaced in the distance as lights twinkled around the perimeter of the banks of the Hudson River. Bubbles shared how thankful she was to be here with her hiking family. That's clearly Mountain Man and Karma. I've been lucky enough to see this group a third time now and each time has been so enjoyable. Just as everyone was settled in for the night, Karma said how glad she was to have seen me again. It was too dark for her to see the big smile on my face but I let them all know that it was there. Bubbles immediately began singing ""Oh Happy Day"" as Sprout begged her to stop with the rest of laughing until there was silence. I can look out of the shelter tonight anytime I want to see the lights of homes and other buildings but I'm glad to be where I am. The transition back seems complete. I'm comfortable sleeping on a pad with my clothes bag as my pillow. Tomorrow will be a full day of hiking. My long break ended hours ago.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534892,"The Whippoorwill began singing early, really early. Then it's song became louder and louder. The rain came too. You'd think this might lead to tired hikers who might not be in the best of moods. Not this group. They woke up happy. Bubbles became the DJ playing Bohemian Rhapsody, then Look On the Bright Side Of Life was mentioned and there was laughter remembering Monty Python skits. Bubbles played Bright Side Of Life by Rebelution before playing the Monty Python tune. It was easy to be up with this group. As I headed out, the sun arrived.I was a bit confused backtracking to get to the AT. The West Mountain Shelter was .6 of a mile from the AT and there were several other trails. Fortunately I made my way back. The trail today was very good, with wide dirt paths being common. The climb up and down Bear Mountain was primarily on rock steps or other types of trail to make hiking this part of the trail fun and relatively easy.   Extra food and drink were plentiful today with vending machines at the top of Bear Mountain and also at the Trailside Zoo. Near the end of today's hike was the Appalachian Deli. The sandwiches there were very good and the portion sizes were big. I hiked with Karma and Mountain Man for most of the day today. Our topics were varied and covered politics and social issues along with a good bit about the previous and future adventures of this young Swiss couple. They already were in India and their next stop after leaving America will be Australia. These two know adventure and it was a real pleasure hiking with them today. A call to Beth confirmed that Anne & Pat's wedding plans are really coming along. A date has been finalized and the Church and Wedding Reception venue have been reserved. It's great to hear about the progress that's been made.As night arrived and we were chatting around a picnic table, a headlamp came down the road and then it came towards us.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535054,"Sometimes things work out and sometimes they don't. I caused my problems today. It's taken me a while tonight to grow up a bit and realize it but I'm at peace with tonight's challenges. It's somewhat rare for me to not push myself out here. Yesterday was an exception where I embraced what realistically could be hiked and accepted it. Yesterday was a great day. Last night I came up with a plan to hike 23.9 miles and get to Mountain Top Deli, a place where I can get a hot meal and then take them up on their offer and tent behind their store. It sounded like a pretty good plan. Yes, that's a lot of miles in New York where you never know if the hiking will be torturous or easy. I knew it was going to be one of the hottest days out here too. The trail today was primarily the kind that required selective foot placement either on rocks or around rocks. This type of trail doesn't enable me to hike with any momentum or speed. Today's hike also had numerous ups and downs hidden within AWOL's elevation profile. I didn't stay at RPH shelter but did speak with Smudgy Cheeks, who was staying there. Smudgy Cheeks said RPH was nice and he already had gotten pizza delivered there. The shelter did look nice as I went by it. The climbs after RPH shelter were grueling late in this hiking day. The last one right before Stormville contained many switchbacks. I really needed them at that time. Blues Brother completed today's hike in 9 1/2 hours, 3 hours less than it took me.So, what went wrong today? It all fell apart after we ate pizza from the store next to Mountain Top Deli. There's a nice lawn with a picnic table behind Mountain Top Deli. AWOL's guide says hikers can tent there and I called and confirmed it. But once I got there, I was informed that the pizza owner complained and tenting wasn't allowed there. Instead, an area ""down the street and around the corner"" was where we could tent. That sounded okay and we ate and talked at the picnic table. As darkness approached, we left to hike to tonight's camping area. What seemed easy originally was confusing to say the least. We found an empty lot between houses in the neighborhood, but we weren't certain this lot was where we should be. Blues Brother had plenty of trees to anchor his hammock but I had virtually no flat places for my tent and had to find them around debris that had been left here over many years. The stores closed at 8:00 so I hadn't left any time to go back and ask if we'd found the right place. It was extremely muggy at 8:30 so being as tired as I was, despite having eaten food and drinking cold sodas, made for a lousy way to end this day. Poor Beth. I called her in the darkness after setting up my tent. I was in a foul mood because Blues Brother told me to turn off my light when a neighbor drove in next door to the lot we were staying in. I've done some things, like hitchhiking, while hiking the AT that I've never done before, but tenting in an area that is potentially trespassing certainly isn't one that I'd ever consider. And yet, here I was. I hadn't given myself enough time to make certain where I should stay and hadn't given myself enough time to setup and settle in. This hike has covered many miles, but I'm still learning some tough lessons due to my own choices. Came out this morning. Blues Brother & I saw the camp field. It was green and flat. It would've been perfect. One foot in front of the other; tomorrow is another day.","Graymoor Spiritual Life Center

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535344,"New York hiking continued to be full of surprises. The trail often was dirt-based and wide. Blues Brother and I started together early. His regular pace is fast now, at least for me. Since the first hour's trail was relatively flat, I managed to keep up with him. We used to hike this quickly weeks ago but I'm slower now and he's faster. It was good to catch up with each other since it's been a while since we hiked together. I couldn't keep pace with Blues Brother when we came to the first substantial climb today. The distance between us grew quickly and soon he was out of sight. I'd been in that situation before but often was able to catch him during his meal break. The temperature increased steadily throughout the morning. I stopped for water frequently since I experienced numerous painful cramping episodes while trying to sleep last night.  The trail went around Nuclear Lake and then a swampy area. Nuclear Lake looks pretty from a distance but has a mossy film when seen up close. No way I was drinking there with a name like that and its appearance. Wasn't interested in drinking from a swamp either. So I filtered and drank from the next stream. As I was filling up, Booty came by. It was great to see him again and he sat down to catch up. Booty and I first met back in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Our paths have crossed several times since because he's periodically taken a few days off to enjoy time away from the trail in Maryland and New York City. It sounds like he has a trip to Las Vegas coming up in a few weeks so I may be able to get ahead of him and then have him catch me again since he too is a much faster hiker than I am. As I crossed County Road 20 and was taking a picture of Dover Oak, the largest oak on the AT with a girth of 20' 4"", I lit up as I saw a particular car parked nearby. I knew the car to be owned by Captain Kirk and Swamp Angel. Their hike for this year ends just over the Connecticut state line which isn't too far away. Since they hike south each day, I was pretty sure I'd get a chance to see them today. As I hiked through pastures, I became extremely hot due to the lack of shade. I was anxious to see them and lifted my head frequently with its focus far more in the distance than usual.  Mile 1,448 was another surprise. The trail became a raised boardwalk over a swampy, marsh area. This was similar to the New Jersey's boardwalk. A footbridge led to the boardwalk. Right behind the footbridge was a beaver dam. I've never been so close to one before. This one was taller than I imagined them to be. No sign of the beaver though. Down a bit further on the boardwalk was a nice bench and then down beyond that were a couple of Adirondack chairs facing each other. They each had AT symbols carved in them with one named ""Maine"" and the other Georgia"". Had to smile at them. Thanks to those responsible for putting them there. The boardwalk was coming to an end when I saw Swamp Angel and Captain Kirk. We all had smiles on our faces realizing this really would be the last time we'd stop for a chat on the trail. I've really enjoyed these two. Their enjoyment of the trail has been contagious. I'm going to miss them. Hope they will stay in touch if they hike the AT north of New York.  The owner of Native Landscape Garden Center is hiker friendly. Sodas, ice cream, and an outdoor shower are all available there in addition to encouraging words, beautiful plants, and a place to sit down for a moment. I had wilted in the heat today. Booty was there and he waited to hike out with me. We had about 5 miles to hike to the next shelter but it was just around 3:30 so there was plenty of time to get there. It gave Booty and me some time to get to know each other a bit better. Booty began the trail with a good friend but the friend's hike ended early on. I was pretty impressed that Booty kept on going without his friend as I think I would've been devastated to lose my intended hiking partner so early.  Booty's pace was strong, like I thought it would be. I've been struggling with late in the day climbs. I knew about the one coming up. Once Booty was out of sight, I put on headphones to try to get lost in music. A short time later I called Beth to pick me up. I was beat.  I felt badly about not reaching the shelter. I didn't know if Blues Brother was there or not but suspected that was at least where he'd be today. Sent him a message after I got home to say I was okay and ask him about his plans. Blues Brother intends to hike with Booty for a bit. They are a good pair. I am going to miss all these friends. The trail brings people together and separates us too. I'm so much better for having spent time with all of them. Beth was understanding and came to get me as quickly as she could. Yup, a lucky guy I am.","Mountain Top Deli

She was there speaking with another hiker named Stepandahalf. Turns out that Stepandahalf reads my journal. We posed for the picture after talking a bit. He is night hiking currently to avoid the high temperatures. Meeting Stepandahalf was a nice way to start today's hike. The initial climb today was one I'd done a couple days ago before turning around and getting Beth to pick me up. It sure was a lot easier with fresh legs and the cooler morning temperatures. A group of hikers from New York City had just gotten off the train. It was a nice group that included a 2013 Southbound thru-hiker named Professor. Others included a couple who had recently been in Ecuador for a couple years. It's always fun to learn about such varied hikers. Without prompting from me, Professor said he had wished his thru-hike ended a month before it did. It was an interesting comment given my recent bout of doubt.  Today's trail was varied over the day. Most of it was on dirt-based trail that was easy hiking. I was surprised when another hiker going south told me that the trail really became nice near Kent, CT. I thought this trail was pretty nice already.Thanks to the trail angel who provided water at Leather Hill Road and Duell Hollow Road. I was dripping sweat within the hike's first half hour and benefitted greatly from those easy water sources. There was more water at the border between New York and Connecticut. Always good to cross another state milestone.  The Ten Mile River Shelter area looked spectacular. Lots of tents were up and there were many people cooling off in the river. I had an extended conversation with G2, a successful 2013 thru-hiker. I could see how much he enjoyed reminiscing about his hike.  The trail began a substantial climb shortly after passing Ten Mile River. By then it was mid-afternoon and the heat was a bit stifling. Thank goodness for the shade. The bugs began then and didn't let up the entire day. One group of hikers had stopped to replenish their repellent, saying that their ears were under attack. I agreed and said how unfortunate it was that I gave those bugs so much surface area to pursue.  Thunder was heard for the last hour and a half of today's hike. It clearly had rained earlier but I was lucky and hadn't been rained on. The descent between Schaghticoke Mountain Campsite and Thayer Brook was steep, rocky, and rooty. It slowed me down just as I was trying to finish. Finally, the hike was done. Beth was there to whisk me away back home. Between speaking with Beth and the car's comfort, the day's challenges faded.

The day started with a reasonable temperature but got hotter and was pretty miserable as the day went on.Beth and I have previously day hiked portions of today's hike. The climbs and descents were pretty steep. St. John's Ledges is a particularly steep descent filled with countless rock steps. The climbs and descents between Hatch Brook and Carse Brook approximate the famed Roller Coaster that was hiked hundreds of miles ago. Since those portions came at the end of the day, they made for a tough finish in the heat. I just took them at a comfortable pace and was buoyed knowing that Beth would be there to enable me to cool off after finishing. There weren't many hikers on the trail today. One hiker that appeared to be about my age was napping on the trail as I came by. Within an hour after seeing that hiker was a group of three hikers. The older hiker in that group remarked that it just isn't supposed to be this hot yet.  Some smart hikers took advantage of the cool waters of the Housatonic River to cool off.

I've never known anyone who died serving our country nor do I recall, before this AT hike, knowing anyone who knew and spoke of those who had died. This hike changed that. Big Cypress is the lone survivor of a horrific helicopter crash. Blues Brother told me a sad story of the death of one man serving in his unit. My thoughts and prayers go out to all who mourn and celebrate the lives of fallen loved ones. I am grateful for the service provided by veterans I've hiked with - Subman, Blues Brother, Papa Wolf, Big Cypress, Fresh Ground, Who-Dat, Mostly, Clyde, and No Schedule.  While driving myself to resume my hike today, I realized my dependency on the trail's white blazes as I became anxious when not seeing frequent highway signs that confirmed I was still on the right road. Today's hike was intentionally short because the humidity continued to be high even though the temperature was a few degrees cooler. Connecticut trail's continue to be great. The blazes are consistently visible and dirt-based. Poison ivy was encroaching on the trail so I washed off with Dawn after today's hike.   I only saw four hikers today. The climbs came early, much to my liking. The final miles were a shade-covered path along the Housatonic River that ended with the roar of the Great Falls waterfall.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538919,"I've recently seen or been in touch with so many who are close to me. Not feeling well enough to hike on a regular basis for such a prolonged period of time created lots of time to think about my AT adventure. I suspect that I'm experiencing some post-hike feelings that I've previously read from some successful thru-hikers who openly shared the difficulties they encountered in the weeks and months after they finished the AT. It is easy to reminisce about the spectacular people, landscapes, and experiences. They fill me with so much pride and cherished memories for where I've already been. In those periods, the adrenaline is flowing and I'm mentally overwhelmed with thoughts of getting back to the trail. And then, sometime later - sometimes, in just a very short time - I find my thoughts confronted by very different thoughts that seem to serve as a reality check. I've been away from the trail long enough to have taken off my ""rose-colored"" glasses to remember the physical and mental challenges encountered along the way. I've read so many times that post-hike you forget the difficulties or even find yourself loving those difficulties to the extent that overcoming those difficulties are ultimately remembered fondly. Themes about the AT being ""all about the journey and not the destination"" come to mind.  It hasn't been easy to discuss these topics with family and close friends. I'll admit not being proud of my feelings and tone when discussing these challenging observations with Beth. It's been particularly hard sharing such thoughts with Subman, Fresh Ground, and Spirit of 76.  A good number of thru-hikers intentionally avoid spending time in comfortable surroundings like towns so that they aren't weakened and increasingly vulnerable to surrender their dreams to creature comforts. Throughout my hike, I, more than many other hikers, took advantage of opportunities to stay in comfortable surroundings in a town or a hostel.  I've increasingly become aware of how much I enjoyed the comraderie and social aspects of this hike. This awareness doesn't come to me as a surprise because I had read about them while preparing for this adventure. As my trail families and relationships formed, I felt those strong bonds. I don't think I realized at the time how potentially dependent I became on them. As I think about hiking more or less alone for extended periods of time, I'm currently not liking those moments as much as I thought I would or as much as I enjoyed them in the many weeks and months when my morning and evening found me surrounded by members of my trail family.  I'm not sure where this is going. It is a journey. It is spectacular and it is challenging. Most say that the mental challenge of the hike far exceeds the physical challenge. Without question, I am aware that I've encountered increasing mental challenges about continuing this hike.  Thanks for coming along with me. You are a part - in all honesty, an important part - of my trail family experience. Some of you have stated that you are with me as you are preparing for your AT adventure in the coming years. I thought I owed you my awareness of these thoughts as I come out of this bout with Lyme Disease.  On a lighter note, I'll share another observation. My Mom always taught me to clean my plate and eat every bit of food places on it. In my younger years, she frequently reminded me of those starving people who lacked such food. Recently, I noticed I've taken such ""cleaning my plate"" to a whole new level as I now habitually use the tines on my fork to scrape my plate clean so that every scrap and tiny morsel are consumed.","Home

I watched him speak with so many people for lengthy periods of time as he engaged them. He led and taught by example. I was very young, but vividly remember him leading some church volunteers to repaint the home of a church member's home to eliminate the racial hate and swastikas that shockingly smeared their home in the early '60's.

I didn't see anyone after she left for an hour so I had time to absorb my surroundings. I was happy that hiking seemed fresh. Mountain Laurel has bloomed and is plentiful. The CT trail continued to be dirt-based with a wide path. I met a few people today. Shotgun was the first and seems to be about my age. He got his name from his being carsick so he always sits in the front seat. Shotgun started in Harper's Ferry on May 1st and crossed the 500 mile marker today. Kettering Strider was the next hiker I spoke with. She got her name because she is from Kettering, Ohio. Interesting that she is back on the trail now after hiking 1,500 miles in 2014. I told her that this was my first day back after contending with Lyme Disease and that I'd be crossing my 1,500 mile marker today. As we separated, I wondered if our paths intentionally crossed today. There were a few families and a few groups out hiking today. I marveled at how a girl who seemed about 5 years old handled a climb with ease while I prepared to carefully and slowly select each step. I complimented a counselor who encouraged a young man who was skeptical about climbing a large boulder. The counselor said there were many options available and to select one and then have confidence as he steps forward. I asked the counselor if he'd like to escort me to Katahdin. The views today were a surprise. The .6 mile ridge line walk along Mt. Race was pretty spectacular. I liked it more than Virginia's Tinker Cliffs that is highly regarded. Shotgun and I are sharing The Hemlocks Shelter tonight and he mentioned that he thinks there were more views today than in the previous 150 miles. Spirit of 76, Teach, and Steady are supposed to be within 20 miles of me today. I think Two Peas may be in my vicinity too. But our paths did not cross today.Hiking 14 miles today with a 30-something backpack took some effort today. I tired after 6 miles but kept going since it was only around noon. As the temperature dropped mid-afternoon, I could feel a bit of renewed energy. The challenge today was clearly more mental than physical. I expected it would be after not being on the trail for such a long time. Thanks to everyone who sent me messages or signed my trailjournal page today. Your support arrived throughout the day and lifted my spirits. 1,500 miles and another state down. My mind seemed to drift and recall some great experiences today. While eating dinner tonight, Shotgun remarked how his 500 miles is a great distance but that needing to hike almost another 1,700 seemed daunting. I found myself thinking similarly about my remaining miles. I know I didn't think this way before being sidelined. As I write this, I'm remembering that I did feel that my hike was threatened when my knee problem surfaced. Now I don't even think about my knees. I think there's a lesson to be learned.","Home

The morning was comfortably cool. Chin Music, one of my favorite prior year thru-hikers, wrote that the initial 3 miles today were among the hardest to date so I was anxious about today's hike. My experience has taught me that the trail's conditions due to the weather's impact can significantly change one's perspective. It didn't take long though before the challenging trail was encountered. The challenges primarily consisted of steep, rocky descents. They weren't long in duration but they were tight and required careful foot placement, maneuvers that slow me down. I couldn't really tell how slowly I was hiking and was pleasantly surprised to arrive at the Jug End View, Mile 1,515.4, that marked the end of this challenging section. The view there was expansive and the rocks provided amphitheater-like seating, the perfect spot to have breakfast.Today had the intriguing possibility of hiking with Spirit of 76, Teach, & Steady. Spirit and I recently exchanged messages and I returned to the trail yesterday thinking that our paths might align today. Well it almost happened. By the end of the day, Beth picked me up and drove us to Great Barrington to visit. We all started hiking February 16th and it's been months since we've seen each other but the ease as we spoke reminded me of how quickly Beth and I are able to speak with our closest lifelong friends. It doesn't matter how long since we last spoke, we speak and share as if we've never been apart. Dinner came and went and our trail stories just kept flowing. It was way past hiker midnight when it was apparent we were all running out of energy. None of us know how many miles we'll hike together in the coming days but we took great pleasure realizing that we're this far along in essentially the same place. We know that our Feb 16th starting group includes Subman & Suds, who are may be 5 days behind, and the Big O, who may be 5 days ahead.  Even before the stories and sharing began, I found myself being bombarded with recollections of my trail experience. It was like a highlight reel of sorts, memories of people, places, and the challenges.There was plenty of hiking today too. The trail had lots of pine needles, lots of long stone walks, walking through flat pastures, and started with those tricky descents. The trail was wide in parts and very tight in other sections. Can't say that I liked the tight trail as I couldn't help but wonder if ticks were finding me again. I told Beth I was lucky she picked me up when she did. My intention this morning was to hike another 2.5 miles today, and while there was time left in the day to do those miles, I was really tired and my hips were squawking by the end of the hike. I leapfrogged with a clean hiker a few times. Each time we passed each other we talked a bit longer. My question asking about the origin of his trail name led to a long period of hiking together. This is One Boot's eighth year of hiking the trail and he's hiking to the beginning of the White Mountains this year. During his first year, a black bear came within a few feet behind him as he was sitting at a shelter. He said the bear jumped back as far as he initially jumped. The bear was menacing and returned a few times despite One Boot getting help from others in the shelter to shoo the bear away. The bear made off with and gnawed one of his boots during one of bear's visits to the shelter. One Boot will have just 350 miles to go after he finishes his hike this year. I really admire hikers who return year after year. It has to be hard starting each time without trail legs and then leaving just as the capacity to hike more miles is realized.  A special thanks to Dottie. She's a trail angel who left many water jugs along the trail the last couple days. The water was cool, refreshing, and so appreciated.Day 2 back was easier mentally than yesterday. I found myself getting back into the physical challenge of the trail. All in all it was a very good day. And as I've said before, Beth made the day so special. Beyond driving me to my trail friends, she was there to meet and spend time with them too.","Hemlocks Shelter

One goat noticed me taking a picture and started coming my way. Soon a number of its friends were coming too. Beth started to become concerned but really lost it when the lead goat found its way through the fence. I think I heard ""Run!!""

Jennifer, Jeff, and the two of us gave our hiking histories and then she surprised us. While doing trail maintenance, she carries with her an insulated cooler. Long distance hikers get their choice of chocolate or oatmeal ice cream cookies. Oh was it good! Yes, I shared mine with Beth. Twenty yards down the trail we met Sour Wood, Mother Nature's husband, who had clippers out and was trimming brush back to provide a wide trail. Sour Wood cut down a couple of sour wood trees many years ago and made walking sticks out of them. He got his trail name when he was hiking down in Georgia with one of his homemade poles. We thanked them for their dedicated work. As I turned around to yell back about how delicious my cookie was, I could see they were already working the trail. Note to self - join a trail maintenance crew - these people are great up and down the trail. The trail itself was pretty easy today. Lots of hiking on pine needles. It was fun to hear Beth question why the trail was going up again. There were a few climbs and one nice descent with gentle switchbacks. There were several ponds today too.

It's fun to remember and tell her about Blues Brother's jokingly told of his plan to write a letter commenting about his willingness to provide additional cans of white paint for blazes and how Fresh Ground repeatedly told us that this next climb was ""the last climb of the day"" and how he'd start saying it from morning until late afternoon. Make no mistake, Beth and I along with everyone I've hiked with really appreciates how the trail is maintained and how it weaves us up and over, here and there, and everywhere in between. We know how lucky we are to be hiking this trail and I know how lucky I am to have these hiking days with her.We came upon Jeff and Jennifer today while they were taking a moment to enjoy the water and a view of the Upper Goose Pond. They are easy to talk with and we hope to have more moments like this with them. Speaking with them let Beth understand just how enjoyable my daily chats with Swamp Angel and Captain Kirk were. Beth and I hiked the .5 mile blue blaze trail to Upper Goose Pond Cabin where we had a quick lunch and spent time speaking with the cabin's caretakers and a few other hikers. This pond and cabin were identified by one of my favorite prior year thru-hikers, Chin Music, as being ""one of the jewels of the AT"" and I enthusiastically agree. This place was nice. We enjoyed going over the MA Turnpike 90 overpass and wondered how many times we'll pass it in the future years with a memory of today. This time together is bringing the fun back into this hike, which is why it began.","Main Road - Tyringham, MA - Mile 1,541.2

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539824,"Beth's younger sister, Maggie, hiked with us today. The hike itself didn't have many scenic points of interest but trail life and experiences presented themselves. First, Maggie came ready to hike. Hiking with Beth's sisters had to be rescheduled due to my Lyme Disease. Maggie must've kept on training for the hike because she was never winded during the hike and seemingly could've hiked at a faster pace. An 800 foot climb started the hike and didn't phase her. She kept on talking during the climb whereas I selectively chose when to get a word in between the two sisters. Beth and I have previously done day hikes with Beth's other sister, Lynn, and the conversation between these sisters never ends (which is a good thing, it's fun and lively.) The trail was easy after the climb. Nice dirt or pine needles for most of the day with an occasional extended rock sequence mixed in. Finerty Pond was pretty as was the mountain laurel. Water sources were few except for pond areas and those didn't look appealing. I was in the lead as Beth asked if we were still on the trail. Sure enough, the thru-hiker had kept on going and ignored a set of white blazes on two trees that essentially formed a chute or a goal post. I don't recall blaze markings like this before but we saw them a couple more times during the day. Near the end of the day, I jokingly mentioned that we'd let Maggie hike by herself ahead of us and she quickly nixed that idea. The trail in this section may have been rerouted over the years as there were multiple places where two trails seemed to be getting prevalent use only to then arrive at a unified trail a little farther ahead.  Our lunch spot was the October Mountain Shelter. Maybe it was the heat of the day, but the hikers there eating lunch were anything but welcoming. I've increasingly been disappointed and seen similar behavior where it seems that there's a distinct lack of comraderie between thru-hikers and other hikers out for one or more days. Beth ignored the lack of friendliness and sat down between them, quickly winning them over with friendly chitchat (I loved it and knew to expect nothing less.) The experience was a good one for Maggie to see and fortunately they were much friendlier when we saw many of them again at the Cookie Lady's house. The Cookie Lady's husband recently had a fall and is in the hospital. She was visiting when we arrived so no cookies for us. Then the taxi failed to show resulting in a second taxi being called. The second taxi driver was not familiar with AT trailheads and went way out of his way to get us back to today's starting point. All in all, another good opportunity for Maggie to see that hiking the trail requires flexibility. Spirit of 76 arrived just as the second taxi showed up so Beth and Maggie got a few moments of enthusiastic and genuine conversation about them hiking with me. The weather got warmer as the day went on. The taxi's air conditioning worked well. As Maggie said, it all is part of today's memory.","US 20 - Near Lee, MA - Mile 1,549.7

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539901,"It seems that each day now is a bit different than the one before. Yesterday, I hiked a few miles by myself at the end of the day and then met Beth & Maggie. Today, I hiked the first 7.4 miles by myself and then Beth joined me for the remaining miles. I was flying this morning. It reminded me of Georgia when I was with Subman and Suds. The trail had a climb and had some rocks but it didn't matter. I moved through them with relative ease. I was much faster than 2 miles per hour. I didn't wear my knee brace for the second consecutive day. This was Day 1 without the Lyme Disease medication. Beth was there with me in my head. She's done everything imaginable and then some to restore my health and spirits. There's no way I'm feeling like this without her. I felt great.  There was a railroad crossing just as I was about to get into Dalton, MA. About 5 rail cars passed as I approached. The train would go on for about 15 minutes and actually stopped in front of me for a minute. Yes, I thought about hoisting myself up and walking between the two cars in front of me. No, I didn't do that, and in fact, was relieved when the train moved forward to eliminate that temptation. The train finally passed and I began what turned out to be more than a mile of sidewalk walking through Dalton. A couple hikers were coming my way. I offered them an Oreo, just like Fresh Ground routinely offered candy. They introduced themselves as Flash 52 and Mr. Fix-It. Flash 52 has his own trailjournal blog and I knew that because Beth consistently reads his blog. Our conversation was lively. Flash 52 remembered seeing Fresh Ground and me in Virginia at Four Pines Hostel. Mr. Fix-It insists that he is hiking as ""Katz"" from ""Walk In The Woods"" for Flash 52. They made me laugh a lot. Beth was a bit bummed when she heard of this meeting as she had seen them go by and would've loved meeting them. Beth and I had fun again as we hiked. Just as I was thinking that I was slowing down a bit after hiking more than 10 miles, she asked how I was feeling. I told her how great I felt earlier in the day and that's when she said she noticed how well I was moving.  The taxi scenario took an excessive amount of time again today. Neither of us complained. We just kept busy as we waited. Plans were underway for me to stay in Cheshire tonight. It all made sense that I'd go up and down Mt. Greylock by myself tomorrow. And then I added on to the plan that I might as well stay out the next couple days too. Well, the more I thought about it, the more I didn't like it. I decided to stay in the car. It was a tough decision that bothers me a good bit. Tonight on the way home there was a beautiful, complete rainbow visible for miles as we left Massachusetts and entered Connecticut. It was a great ending to the day.","Blotz Road - Mile 1,562.3

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540054,"Today was a homecoming of sorts. Beth and I climbed Mt. Greylock as our first day hike just a few years ago. Gordon, our friend at the gym, recommended this mountain. I chose the trail that day and really messed up. We hiked ""Greylock In The Round"", a 16.9 mile hike. Stupid, stupid Rob. Each step taken in the final hour that day was painful for Beth. Both of us were sore for a couple days. It was way too many miles and the terrain featured a water crossing, a spectacular waterfall, and enough climbs to make for one memorable day that we ""fondly"" remembered today. Then there was the memory of hiking with our daughter Anne and her fiancé Pat and his Dad too. Somehow Pat got the wrong impression about the length of that hike. He asked me just an hour and a half into the hike if it was almost over. I sadly had to tell him the hike had barely begun and then I got us lost that day so we hiked an extra mile. We've hiked Greylock with Beth's sister Lynn too. Today's climb was from a completely new direction though. We were both surprised that today's climb was easier than we had expected. The climbs were distributed and there were somewhat lengthy flat stretches that enabled us to catch our breath. The trail up to Greylock consisted of fine pine needles that surrounded the anchored rocks. At times the sweet pine smell was strong. We lucked out on the weather. When we placed one car at the summit this morning we needed the most windshield wipers on to cut through the fog or mist. It looked to be a bad day weather wise, but that changed as we started and soon we were glad that the day wasn't any warmer and we frequently let each other know when we felt a cooling breeze.  My thoughts today were filled with concerns for other hikers who have their own trailjournal blogs. Last night, I learned that the thru-hike for the Two Peas just ended after Moonbeam broke her femur and had to be taken off a nearby mountain after a fall. I learned tonight that her surgery was successful. Last night, I read a long-awaited post from Rocketman & Princess. It has been a number of days since news came of their seeming near-death experience due to hypothermia overtaking them in New Hampshire's White Mountains. They intend to write more about that experience but at least I learned that they are out and about assisting the hiker that first came to their rescue. Then there was Slipknot, who somewhat jokingly, said he was glad he was carrying 5 days of food on his back or else he feared he would've been blown off the mountain that was close to the location Rocketman & Princess encountered their problem. Beth and I talked plenty during today's hike but my mind returned to these hikers and thoughts of others out here like us. We got a fresh reminder of just how quickly an accident can happen as we came across 3 fit men. One was holding a bloody paper towel on his nose, saying that one of his buddies had punched him before admitting that he had just fallen on a rock I was stepping on. We had a number of friends hiking around us today and gathered for a cold drink and food at Greylock's summit in Bascom Lodge. Spirit of 76, Teach, and Steady were there as was Tuna Roll, an ex-military guy who I've now seen and spoken with the last several days. It was an energetic group who were feeling good about the climb. Teach & Steady and I decided to complete the Greylock descent in the afternoon since the bad weather forecaster for today wasn't to arrive until early evening. Beth saw Teach & Steady at a road crossing and heard that the descent was tough. Steady sounds like he is experiencing an overuse injury similar to my knee problem so the descent must've been painful because it involved some steep rock steps and boulders. I feel fortunate today that the hike was done in good weather. I hope my hiking friends remain safe. For those of you who were Hill Street Blues fans, I hope we can all heed Sergeant Phil's closing roll call saying ""Let's be careful out there.""","Main St & School St, Cheshire, MA - Mile 1,577.5

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540330,"This was a big day from several perspectives. Beth has never hiked this many miles before. Today's miles are more than I've hiked since returning to the trail. Early in the hike we left Massachusetts and entered Vermont so 11 states are done with 3 to go. It was apparent from the drive home last night that we were now as far away from home as we could be and be able to hike a full day. Must say that it's really been nice to return home these past days. I realized some time ago that I enjoy hiking more than camping. I love the trail's hikers and characters but have experienced a greater challenge getting to know everyone gathering around the shelters and think it is because of the increased numbers on the trail now that summer arrived. Given today's miles to hike, we were out reasonably early but the drive was long so we began hiking a few minutes before 9:00. North Adams stands out as one of the friendlier towns since Virginia. There were road walks through town yesterday and today and I got waves as cars passed by and a greeting from someone tending their garden this morning. North Adams also provides a seemingly safe extended parking location that is very close to the trail. The road walk this morning was short and it was moments into the hike that a brook's gurgling greeted us. Other trails or play areas were visible but the trail was nicely blazed so staying on course was easy. The brook accompanied us until we started to climb. Last night's rain was evident. Pine needles and leaves were washed down the path in clumps and we realized the path must've been somewhat of a waterway last night. The trail contained more rocks than the last few days but there was plenty of space between them so we had the choice of placing our feet between the rocks or on them. Beth says she wants to put a saying on the back of my shoes since she looks there so much. She noticed that I hike on the rain-softened dirt while she hikes on the stones. I really enjoy her observations as they are fresh and remind me how such observations were the norm in Georgia. There was a boulder field climb of a magnitude not seen since Pennsylvania. I was glad Beth experienced this as she had been questioning want PA was like. Beth said she enjoyed the climb and all I could do was smile as I wondered whether she'd like a steady diet of it for a couple days as exists in Pennsylvania. The breeze at the summit was cool and we appreciated how it dried us. The MA / VT border came next and we met Archer there. Archer is early on in his return to the trail. He is headed to Mt. Katahdin to finish his 2014 hike that ended in Salisbury, CT with an Achilles injury. Vermont's first 105 miles are shared by the Appalachian Trail and the Long Trail. The Long Trail goes from its southern MA border to Canada. We met a number of Long Trail hikers during today's hike. There was an extended flat section before the next substantial climb that began after lunch. The cool breeze was needed and its absence was noticed in the afternoon when humid conditions arrived. Must say that Beth maintained a positive tone throughout. I write this not to be condescending but instead to remind me of how she lifted me with her approach. We were glad when the second significant climb was over. I managed to miss a white blaze after crossing what was once a road. I became concerned after not seeing a blaze for 10 minutes. We turned around and saw 4 young guys that we had passed a while back. They said we were still on the AT but I went back to find the last white blaze. Sure enough, I missed the trail and a blaze. We yelled to the guys and they came running back. Not certain how far they would've gone before realizing they missed the turn. It is Day 1 in Vermont so it's possible this next comment doesn't apply to the rest of this state's trail but here goes. So far double blazes are not used to indicate the trail's turns. Vermont also doesn't use the practice of placing fallen branches to visually block a hiker from hiking in a wrong direction when multiple path options exist. This comes into play when combined with Vermont's practice of not clearing fallen branches and blowdowns from the trail. I quickly became comfortable stepping over blowdowns and limbs as was the case in Shenandoah. After my miscue Beth put a new rule into effect consisting of having to find a white blaze quickly after any road crossing or a blowdown. The breeze at the powerline on Mile 1,601 was awesome! It was so refreshing. I doubt that Beth and I will ever forget it. A few miles later we passed Consultation Peak that has one of the best stealth campsites I've seen on the entire trail. Flat, a fire ring, nicely nestled, with a water source nearby. Space for just 1 tent. We came upon another brook as we headed to the Congdon Shelter. The noise connected us to the morning that now seemed a long time ago. The Congdon Shelter was dark. I was glad I wasn't staying in the shelter or tenting there. We met Bucky there, a young thru-hiker who is moving along quickly but he was the only hiker to greet us. I can't understand what is going on recently. Can the lack of welcoming be due to concerns about limited tenting or shelter space? It isn't pleasant and is a real put-off. This is such a change from the early months.  The trail after Congdon Shelter was lousy. Yesterday's rain was abundantly evident and Beth's introduction to why Vermont is commonly mentioned as ""Vermud"" was complete. We'd seen plenty of muddy trail in the morning but then long sections had dried out. Now, standing puddles became commonplace and it was unfortunate because we both were tired and still had 4 miles to go. Thank goodness we climbed out of Congdon Shelter's drudgery. We appreciated the better trail and refreshing breezes, even if they were intermittent. Then the day's final long descent was upon us. Chin Music wrote a few years ago that this was very steep and it was. It was steep, rocky, and gnarly. The miles we've been doing together and the length of today's hike have Beth's knees squawking a bit on the downhills. She doesn't complain but I've been there myself and with others. It isn't fun and can be painful. This was a tough descent for me too. It was almost 1,000 feet down. Slug, a thru-hiker we met a few days ago, came by and hopped the rocks with ease. Future hikers take note. This descent will be fun if you're a rock hopper and not be pleasant for someone like me. Still, it came at the end of the day and ended our long, ambitious day. Neither of us had anything left and we were both glad to find the car we had placed the night before. Was Beth happy with the day - Yes! Was I? You bet. Experiencing a day like this with Beth was memorable.","MA 2, Hoosic River - Mile 1,592.2

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540487,"Our two car strategy failed after completing our hike into Bennington. The time needed to retrieve our southern car left us driving in the dark as we looked for the Stratton-Arlington Road trailhead. I was frustrated when we couldn't find the trailhead. So I returned to the Bennington hotel to say I wouldn't be spending the night there. The travel time took 3.5 hours on this failed car scenario. We drove both cars home to figure out what to do. I'll admit that stopping this thru-hike was winning out while I drove home.  It is routinely said to ""Don't quit on a bad day."" Two hours before finishing the hike into Bennington, I had told Beth that this was a great day, a day I felt really good about. I was really happy with the day and how I was feeling. As Mark (Beano, Ugly, etc.) wrote after yesterday's entry, I was ""back"".  Sleep helps make sense of things and I started to review my AWOL Guide and maps to see where I'd gone wrong. It comes down to the reality that it takes a lot of time to drive around mountains. It appears this car shuffle time is the most we'll encounter in Vermont. So we decided to catch up on chores at home and visit Beth's parents before taking a second run at hiking together with the two car strategy. The visit with Beth's parents was great. Blues Brother and I have talked and gotten caught up. Blues got Lyme Disease and Sooner Or Later did too. Blues just successfully hiked through the White Mountains and has headed home for an 18 day break before returning to finish. Word came on Friday that Rambo successfully finished his thru-hike. Rambo said he expected to be sore as he heads back home. Can't tell you how happy I am for these two. Rambo sent me a couple of his summit pictures and I see that Rambo summited with a number of hikers who quickly went by me - The Kid, Padiwan, Rhino, John Goodman, and Bookworm.   I recently changed my backpack and went back to REI to exchange it. REI was great about the return and Matt, who had helped me many months ago, helped me again. Not Yet, a successful 2015 thru-hiker who I spoke with before my hike was there too. It was good to talk with him about my hike and its challenges. Talking with Not Yet was helpful.  My hike resumes on July 4th. On paper, I have an outline to hike to the White Mountains before our family vacation at the end of July. We found the trailhead that evaded us a few days ago. It was less than a mile beyond where we turned around a few nights ago. Lessons never stop - keep on plugging.","VT 9 - Bennington - Mile 1,610.6

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540805,"Since the distance between parking trailheads was 20+ miles, we thought the smart thing to do was for me to hike without Beth today. Beth dropped me off at the trailhead early because today's mileage was more than I've hiked in a long time.  With fresh legs, I got my first ""10 by 10"". That's 10 miles by 10 a.m. While hiking, I was continually thinking about everyone in my life, on and off the trail. It has been some time since I hiked alone. I immediately thought of what Beth and I would routinely say as we hiked together. Since the hike began with a climb, I missed the typical ""I'm breathing hard, are you?"" that is followed by ""I'm sweating."" And then finally comes the ""Alright, a flat spot."" And sometimes we even get ""That breeze feels great!"" So this played out in my head, even though she wasn't right behind me. Given Fresh Ground's smackdown to yesterday's entry - I loved it and Beth and I were both laughing at every word, I almost can't bear writing this but this accurately reflects my thoughts this morning. So when I replaced my backpack last week, I forgot to remove my clips for the Z-Packs front pouch that I've used from Day 1 of this hike. I really wasn't happy about it initially and as I thought about it while hiking, I recalled a common hiker saying - ""If you don't have it, you don't need it."" That made sense and I found myself enjoying not having it. Then that guy came into my mind - Fresh Ground. If I didn't already have a trail name, Fresh Ground would've named me ""Mr. Bag-It"". He mocked me endlessly for the number of bags I carried and my practice of placing all my gear into bags. Fresh Ground would've loved busting me today for not having my very visible front pouch.  At 8:22 my heart stopped. A bird lifted off a few feet to my right and made so much noise that I jumped. I was glad nobody was there to see it. The other thing that caught my attention today wasthe number of stealth campsites today. There had to be an established stealth site every couple of miles. They didn't have a water source, but they were otherwise great. There was a stealth site at Mile 1,631.6 that had a water stream with a gurgling brook too. Earlier in the day, I passed three young people heading to Canada to hike the Long Trail. They asked me if there were more stealth sites ahead (the beard must make me look like I know something). I basically said that I thought more would exist. Hope they found this one since it was where they hoped to end their hike today.   The Goddard Shelter arrived when I wanted a break and was feeling good about my ""10 by 10"". I scanned the shelter's log book to see if I could find out if Bubbles and Sprout had stayed here. Sure enough, they stayed here on June 18th. Bubbles log entry was about the sweet smelling pine - and she was right. The pines smelled great. And her entry reminded me of how sweet this couple is.The views from the Glastenbury Mountain lookout tower were great despite today's haze. They reminded me of the balds seen many states ago. I love views like this even though I don't know which mountains are those I've hiked, or will hike, or won't ever hike.  The afternoon came with a surprise. Jennifer and Jeff came from behind me. We talked for a bit before they went ahead. Then, I caught them as they took a break. We walked together for the next several miles until we got to the shelter they were staying at tonight. I continued a few more miles to get to my car so that I could drive to stay with Beth.  Thanks to all of you for being there and making it the good day that it was. Hope you all had a good July 4th holiday.!","VT 9 - Bennington - Mile 1,610.6

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540905,"Today's hike was a repeat for me. Not this year, but several years ago when my son David and I hiked it. It was different today because I hiked it with Beth. Beth loved today's hike. She said it early in the day and was still saying it at the end of the day when we both were tired. Best hike ever! I couldn't argue with her. We started before 6:00 a.m. in order to minimize hiking during the afternoon heat. The Stratton Mountain climb was 1,700 feet but we were able to consistently walk during the climb. There was some water and mud but it was manageable. And the trail was wide and beautifully blazes. We worked hard and were sweating a good bit, but we were hiking in beautiful greens that looked great in filtered light. The pines surfaced as we climbed higher. An interesting aspect of today's hike is how its best parts just appeared before us. We climbed and climbed and all of a sudden we were at the summit of Stratton Mountain. It opened up before us with a tall lookout tower. I thought the tower itself was the sturdiest I've been on. Beth was surprised how uneasy she was as she stepped up. The views were a bit hazy but they were stunning. Vermont is a beautiful state. We saw a lot of it while we were way above tall trees. After that experience, we descended almost as much as we climbed. Again, the trail was relatively easy and interesting. And then, seemingly out of nowhere was expansive Stratton Pond. Today's hike included a number of footbridges that showed off brooks that made those beautiful sounds as the water flowed over boulders. We walked over many planks. We met two couples hiking the Long Trail, one going north and one going south. We laughed as one in the group of very young girls, who were heading home in this their third day, responded to their counselor that they were doing ""terrible"". We smiled as the counselor explained that it was important that everyone fill up their bottles with water when the group stops to fill up their water bottles.  I was thrilled to find Ziptie's entry in the Stratton Mountain summit lot. Ziptie's entry was dated just a few days ago. I remember briefly speaking with Ziptie when as she was just beginning her hike many, many miles ago. Back then she was concerned about her progress. She's come a long way. Now I'll be the one seeking her thoughts and advice.  Days like this stand out.","Stratton-Arlington Rd, Kelly Stand Rd - Mile 1,633

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541067,"It was an interesting day today. My thoughts frequently took me back to the first time I hiked this section with my son David a few years ago. I shared some of those moments with Beth and then we created some of our own.  We started hiking before 6:00 a.m. again. By the end of the day we were again glad that we did because the temperature rose steadily throughout the day. The morning was cool but we were warmed quickly by the first climb. The Bromley Mountain climb wasn't difficult though. There was wide trail and the incline was such that we consistently could walk it up. By the time we reached the top it was warming up. Right before the summit is a walk through a meadow in full sunlight. David and I hiked it around noon a few years ago, Beth quickly realized how much better it was to hike it around 8:00 a.m.. The descent had some steep steps that increasingly are troublesome for Beth. She handled them but her knees are beginning to ""talk""' to her. Going slower and taking smaller steps while avoiding jarring steps down help so that's become her practice. The second climb got us. It was steeper. Luckily, it had some flat sections that enabled us to catch our breath before we started going up again. The view at Styles Peak was hazy as were the views from Bromley Mountain. The stories about my hike with David were coming easily. The one by Styles Peak reminded me that a section hiker named Trillium took pity on me and asked if I'd like some help with my backpack. She had worked at an outdoors store and could quickly see that I was carrying too much weight on my shoulders. She repacked my bag and then showed me how to put most of my weight on my hips. It made such a difference and she was so helpful. One story led to another. David running out of water and then realizing he didn't feel great because he had drank too much water. Trillium sitting around the picnic table that night and saying ""you know you're doing this all wrong"" after hearing that we had hiked 15 miles the first day and more than that on the second - way too many miles for hikers like us out for a few days.  The Peru Peak Shelter should take about 1.5 hours after Styles Peak. After about 45 minutes heading towards this shelter, I realized I hadn't seen a white blaze in a while. So I started to carefully look for them. But they weren't there. Initially 10 minutes passed without a white blaze, then 20, then 30. I was starting to really be concerned. I was pretty confident that we were on the AT but where were the blazes. Beth just mentioned her knees so the thought of turning around to find a white blaze wasn't appealing. Since we had started so early this morning I was confident we could overcome a screwup like this but it wouldn't come without some pain and anxiety. At one hour and twenty minutes from Styles Peak, I told Beth that I may have gotten us lost and off the trail. I said we'd go forward another 10 - 15 minutes to try to find the shelter. If we didn't find it then we needed to turn around. She took the news well. Five minutes later we found a sign about this area being a wilderness area in which signage and trail maintenance would be minimized. I'd hiked through one of these areas the other day when hiking solo. The other day the trail continued to be blazed. Apparently, this section wasn't. A few minutes later we were sitting at the shelter's picnic table eating lunch. Quite a turnaround in a few minutes. I was relieved to say the least.  While eating lunch, Beth commented that she thought the wind chimes she saw hanging in front of the shelter would be annoying when hikers tried to sleep. I didn't have to look at them. I just started laughing. Then I laughed even more thinking how hard other hikers would also be laughing. The ""wind chimes"" Beth saw were actually string contraptions that included a tin can and a small piece of wood. They are used to hang backpacks. They are used to prevent mice from getting into the hanging backpack. Mice can't crawl over the inverted tin can to get to the backpack. I may not be explaining this adequately, but trust me when I say that anyone who has stayed in a shelter would've laughed pretty hard like I did. I love hiking with Beth.  The hike beyond Peru Peak Shelter included nice footbridges with a gurgling brook or nice swamp areas. There were more plank walks today than have been seen for many states. We came to the Baker Peak climb. A climb up long boulders that contained numerous slices. I told Beth how I remembered this being a long, difficult climb for me when I did it with David. Not today. The view was as great as it was before, but the climb was much easier today. Guess hiking for several months is paying off.  Also paying off is looking at shelter logs. I found entries from Ziptie and Bubbles again. Loved them both and am looking forward to finding more in the future. Ziptie wrote how Bromley's summit took her to scenes from The Sound of a Music. Bubbles wrote how she hiked in the rain and was singing ""I'm singing and hiking in the rain.""  Reminders of the past and new memories too. So glad I didn't get us lost.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541179,"My daughter Anne joined Beth and me last night and hiked with us today. In the AWOL guide, today's hike didn't appear to offer us anything really interesting but it was a beautiful hike. We again started early. This is really helping us beat most of the heat and minimizes the likelihood of late afternoon storms that routinely are forecasted.   Our hike started out flat and that was great since it gave the ability to talk as we hiked. There's always lots to talk about - family, Anne's wedding plans, and this hike to name a few. Little Rock Pond is big with plenty of clear water. We understood why we went by a number of tents there. Going over a nice footbridge that provided another nice scene made me realize today's hike was turning out better than expected. The greenery around us in the filtered light looked great. We came to the first climb of the day and found that we could walk it up. The pine smells and trees arrived with the higher elevation. At times it was like our walks through a Christmas tree farm. Sometimes we enjoyed narrow trail surrounded by pines on each side, then it opened up and let us hike through an open area while continuing to take it all in. Two separate cairn gardens stood out as something rarely seen. Then there was the waterfall that first provided soothing sounds and then showed off as it danced downstream.   Guess I've forgotten to mention the Anne's trail magic. We parked Anne's car at a spot essentially halfway into today's hike. Anne brought a huge cooler filled with Gatorades and candy bars. They were fantastic on a day like this! The magic helped us when we took on the second climb of the day, an 1,100 foot climb up Bear Mountain. It had plenty of switchbacks but it was long. It was tiring. It was great in that Anne openly acknowledged that she was impressed that we hiked like this day after day. The descent to Clarendon Gorge was a toe-jammer, steep with a mix of rocks to carefully navigate and plenty of pine needle covering that made steps slippery. The suspension bridge over the gorge was bouncy and provided another unique component of today's hike.   The rain held off. We spent a great day together, a very special day.","Danby-Landgrove Road - Mile 1,668.3

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541377,"Taller mountains are more frequent now. Today's hike peaked at 3,908 feet after starting 2,000 feet lower. It's been some time since the trail had such a climb and I'll admit that initially I was concerned about it, but then I came around and viewed it as just the next obstacle to overcome. Beth headed home after dropping me off. We're on the trail but periodically have to get home to keep things going there. Today was a +20 mile day and I didn't want her attempting to hike such miles. My notes indicated that today's hike would initially be easy. I overlooked two 500' climbs in the first two miles. Minutes into the hike I realized it wouldn't start off easy. The first 500' climb essentially was up a wash used to handle water runoff. It was a messy climb over numerous boulders and requires some large steps. I was quickly working hard. The second 500' climb was easier and was a walk-up that required some work. Easy arrived one hour into the hike and lasted for the next 5 miles. The big climb then began and went for 4 miles. Initially it could be walked up, but it was a bit steep. Then it switched to being a hike between and over tree roots. The trees' roots appeared to be an important part of the trail. Since it poured last night, everything was wet and slippery. I had many more slips and slides today, but fortunately did not fall. The final couple miles of this climb were very steep. This morning's fog lasted past noon. The benefit was a reasonable temperature. And then a cooling breeze came in those last couple miles. I haven't had such a breeze for months and it felt great!  I didn't see many hikers today. I did see two trail maintenance crews though and thanked them for the great trail. Flash, a southbound hiker, was celebrating his 500 mile mark. He told me he likes the White Mountains better than Vermont. I love Vermont so if the Whites really are better than this then I'm in for a treat. The Long Trail separated from the AT today after following the same path for +100 miles. Hiking the Long Trail was my back-up plan if I had quickly bailed out of hiking the AT. It is frequently said that a hiker who successfully hikes the Long Trail will be able to successfully hike the AT. I originally believed that thinking to be true but found my thoughts today challenging such thinking. I accept such thinking from a ""physical"" perspective but now think being on the AT for at least 4 months is far more challenging mentally than what appears to be a maximum of 4 weeks to hike the Long Trail. I've begun to realize how the length of the AT really grinds on you and I've read the toll that it demands in the trailjournals of others who are currently hiking it.  Hiking tall mountains like was done today helps prepare me for the White Mountains that are just one week away.","VT 103 - North Clarendon, VT - Mile 1,683.1

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541511,"""No Rain, No Pain, No Maine!"" That's a common AT saying. True for me today because I knew the forecast was for rain and it was raining when this hike started. Beth found tomorrow's trailhead options and got other things done so that we can keep on hiking. It was dark for a while this morning. Dark enough that I realized I would've put on my head lamp if I was hiking at night. Since it has rained the last two days the trail was wet. The rocks and tree roots were slippery. I was slipping and sliding regularly. But then the rain stopped. I was soaked from sweating more than from the rain.  Kent Pond looked pretty big and is probably great in better weather. The trail passes through property owned by Mountain Meadows Lodge. They are known to be hiker friendly and actually say hikers can stop by but then move on if they are holding a private event as was happening this weekend. As I go by I saw a nice wicker basket near the trail. Sure enough, trail magic. Nothing wrong with eating a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup before 6:00 a.m., right? The trail moved on to Thundering Brook and Thundering Falls. This morning the waterfall was flowing mightily. Then came a professionally done boardwalk. This hike was off to a great start, with or without the rain.  Then the climbs began. Lots of them and with varying ascents and lengths. Each was sloped to enable walking, just a lot slower walking that required effort. The first two stood out. Quimby Mountain was 1,250 feet and was broken into a half dozen ascents separate by a long flat section to enable recovery. The next was 700 feet and it was steeper than the first. The day was filled with ups and downs. It reminded me of the Roller Coaster, just not as hard.  I met a few Southbounders today. The most memorable was Tuna, who asked me which way I was hiking. When I said ""north"" he explained that he was relieved. He went off the trail for bathroom needs and wasn't certain which way he was going. He said it isn't fun hiking when you're not sure. I told him I agreed and had bled in the wrong direction coming out of Damascus, VA. Then I met four men doing trail maintenance on Saturday in the rain. I thanked them and told them how much I'm loving Vermont. The trails and blazes have been top notch.  The main event today was the possibility of meeting up with Subman & Suds. Could I get this hike in and move the car as needed and then have time to drive to see them. Logistics aside, the memories of hiking with them filled my day. And then I began to think of my other hiking buddies too. Lots of smiling today as the rain periodically fell. Beth & I were able to get together with Subman & Suds in the evening.'The time went by too quickly but hopefully we'll get together again soon.","Kent Pond - Killington, VT - Mile 1,704.7

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541762,"I was surprised today. What I experienced today is what makes the AT special and while it should never be taken for granted I should know better than to be surprised. I know the rain forecast set my expectations for a day that I'd need to grin and bear. A highlight I knew I'd work for today was leaving Vermont and entering New Hampshire. Must say that I've loved Vermont.  The first surprise was how dry the trail was. It poured last night. I finished hiking yesterday through a field of waist-high grasses. The trail was so narrow that the grasses completely covered up the trail so every step splashed rain all over me. I assumed this morning's hike would repeat yesterday's finish, but it didn't. Today's hike began with a wide trail. The trail returned to being primarily dirt-based instead of yesterday's trail that required selective foot placement to safely navigate wet rocks and tree roots. I appreciated being dry. Then when it began to rain I noticed the tree canopy absorbed the rain so I heard it but didn't get wet. Okay, so that only lasted an hour but it was a good hour as the first climb wasn't too difficult. Then it poured. Total soak. My glasses had so much water on them that it was difficult to see where I wanted to step. I briefly took my glasses off but that didn't work. I began consistently stepping in mud, but this is Vermont - the state on the AT known for its mud. I dealt with it. AT hikers routinely say ""No rain. No pain. No Maine!"" So don't fight it, embrace it. Admittedly easier said than done, but I really did feel that I was getting the day I expected when today began.  The pastures returned a few times. They came as soon as I was starting to dry my clothes and trailrunners as a result of body heat. I walked up and found my first Southbound thruhiker of the day. Kirby was happily sitting on a log and was wringing out her socks. I met a total of ten Southbound thruhiker a today. Each was young and energetic and amazingly happy hiking in the rain.  The pastures contained many flowers. Their smells were strong at times. Then, I noticed treats along the trail. Wild strawberries and not just a few of them, a lot of them. I nibbled on them. They were small but they were tasty - and I didn't have to carry them.  Filtered light can really make the greenery along the trail be mesmerizing. Periodically, I find myself having to stop and take a moment to recognize how gorgeous my surroundings are. This afternoon's surroundings were unique. I walked for half to three quarters of a mile through endless birch trees. They lined the trail. They were 20 and 50 yards beyond the trail. They were high above me and in the valley below me. The white birch trees stood out against all the surrounding greenery in a unique way that astounded me. Very unique and very special.The highlight of the day came at the end of the initial downpour early in the morning. I crossed a swollen brook. This was the first that had a steel rope available to hold on to when crossing on the boulders. I came up the embankment to a paved road. A pick-up whizzed by but then it stopped a few hundred yards down the road and quickly came back to me. I approached and was greeted by Dick Beatty, a guy a few years older than me who said he previously hiked. He asked if I'd like a ride down the street to get a cup of coffee and get out of the rain. Understand just how soaked and disgusting I looked and yet he went out of his way to welcome me into his truck. Pretty incredible. I asked Last Chance, who completed the AT earlier this year, about his AT experience. His response was that it restored his faith in humanity. Unexpected acts of kindness from strangers. The AT - always full of surprises.","VT 12 - Mile 1,724.1

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541771,"The rain of the last two days cleared out. It was great weather to hike - crisp and cool. It almost felt like a great fall day when Beth and I began our hike today. It had been a few days since we hiked together so we had plenty to talk about. Beth was enjoying the hike and I was enjoying her being there again.  We hiked 8 miles by 10:00 a.m.. They were pretty easy flat miles in nice wooded surroundings. The picture was one of those ""you had to be there"" moments. The sun's rays pierced through the trees to create an incredible scene. I can't say that we understood how this happens but the colors of the rainbow could be seen within some of the rays. We took this in and tried to capture it in a photo. Beth said it made the hike and I couldn't disagree with her. Not shown in the picture was a moment where we jokingly said goodbye to each other as I said Scotty (from Star Trek) was beaming me up as we walked through a particular large and strong ray. We have fun out here. This was a memorable moment.  My deceased Dad's birthday is today. A jet flew above us and streaked white lines of spent fuel through the blue sky. I wrote about this earlier this year. Another special moment on this day.  I hiked on for some additional miles today. In hindsight, Beth should've stayed for the rest of the hike because the weather was so great. On the other hand, the climbs were a bit harder than those in recent days. The first to Moose Mountain's South Peak included a half hour climb without a recovery section. The second to Holts Ledge contained a twenty minute start that had me taking half steps because it was so steep. Each climb provided the reward of a cool breeze at the top along with spacious views. I must admit though that I was tired today - probably a few too many miles in recent days. I was hiking to finish the day which isn't how I want to hike.  I finished today close to my estimated ending time. I looked for Beth's car and then realized my mistake. I was at Dorcester Road and Beth was at a parking lot on Lyme Dorcester Road - another two miles away. No cell access so not much to do but hike on. A car came up - stopped - and asked if I needed assistance. As I was driven to Beth, Terry reminded me that we'd met about a week ago on the trail. He just hurt his knee yesterday. Someone asked him then if he needed assistance and Terry was driven to his car yesterday. I'll be happy to keep this sequence going tomorrow. Don't know who I might help, but you have to admit - it would be neat if such a sequence were to come about.","NH 120 - Hanover, NH - Mile 1,747.7

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541885,"In terms of difficulty, today's hike gave us a bit more than I expected. It gave us some great views too. Beth summed it up that if we'd hiked up, down, and all around with nothing seen or experienced then that wouldn't have been great, but given what we saw, it was a pretty good day. Beth dropped me off so that I could hike the 2 miles to the parking lot that Terry drove me to yesterday afternoon. As I was putting on my pack at the road, a porcupine came down the center of the road towards me and our car. Porcupines, or at least this one, must have horrible vision because it didn't turn away until I made noise. It was an interesting start. Then came some sad news. I came to the trail turnoff to Bill Ackerly's home. For years, Bill has invited hikers to come to his house for free ice cream and a game of croquet. A sign was posted with the news that Bill died on May 23rd so the AT lost a good friend. The climb up Smarts Mountain wasn't exceptionally difficult but it wasn't easy either. After an easy start, the trail began to require selective foot placement between boulders and tree roots. Lambert Ridge provided great views, really exceptional. As pictures were being taken, we learned that we were not alone. Slug called out from above us to ask if we wanted a picture taken of the two of us. We've previously seen Slug a couple times before. Nice guy and clearly a strong hiker. There were a number of hikers going southbound. A standout was Tenderfoot. We were shocked when she said she was 75 years old. Tenderfoot is testing her strength now and hopes to hike in Maine in September so that she can finish her 3rd section hike. We were really impressed with her and were really glad we met her - such an inspirational person. When we continued, the trail continued to be challenging. It featured some unique wooden log steps and then rebar driven into rock slabs. Nothing too difficult, but steep and trail that had us going slower than usual. The payoff was the fire tower on top of Smarts Mountain. We found Slug there and we all climbed up to the expansive views. These views were ""Ooh and Ahh"" quality. Slug stayed as we began hiking again. The trail had some wet sections. The most notable was the one that had puncheons that sunk into the mud and muck. I barely avoided the muck. My hiking pole sunk higher than my knees. We were lucky and found an alternate path around. We stopped for lunch at South Jacobs Brook. It was a real nice setting and we were ready for a break. It was then that we knew this hike would take longer than we'd expected. The climb up Mt Cube featured what seemed to be endless stretches of 100 yards or more of steeper than normal boulder step arounds or boulder steps. This climb came after noon but we agreed the temperature today was more comfortable than we'd expected. Mt Cube continued the white quartzite rock slabs that began with Smarts Mountain. It was here that rock cairns began to be used instead of trail blazes. In a little while, both were missing and we had to hike wondering if we were still on the trail. We fortunately made the right decisions and stayed on the trail. The views on top of Mt Cube were top quality again. The descent was long and similar to what we'd hiked on the way up. It made for slow hiking but we got through with no falls, although Beth had more slips and slides than normal. I forgot a couple stories from yesterday's hike. The first was a noise, kind of a snort or grunt - the kind a bear might make. Beth didn't like it - at all. When we saw a bear footprint along with a cub's footprint she wasn't amused. No, I still haven't seen a bear. The second involves a southbound hiker. He started from Mt Katahdin on June 15th. When I heard that I told him he was flying to be here already. That's when he said his trail name is ""Fly By"" and after a few more words were exchanged, he took off.","Dorcester Road - Lyme, NH - Mile 1,764.5

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542031,"Today's hike was intentionally short. Beth and I needed just under 10 miles to get to the base of Mt. Moosilauke and hiking Moosilauke is plenty enough to do by itself in one day. We needed a short day today, sort of a day of some rest. Our routine has become waking up by 4:30 in order to drive to the trail and start hiking before 6:00 a.m.. We have become tired and took advantage of the fewer miles to be hiked today by sleeping in and having a real breakfast. We've had a great stay at Dowd's Country Inn B&B and we're glad to eat breakfast there this morning. Dowd's feels like a home and you are a member of the family, a spoiled family member. We met a number of nice hikers today. The first was Carrot. He's from Austin, TX and just graduated from high school. Easy to talk with and helpful. Seems he's soon headed home. His girlfriend who was hiking with him sustained an injury on the trail. Carrot introduced the concept of ""Wait For Stay"", a creative (and sneaky) way to get floor space in the upcoming White Mountain huts without working there or paying the +$100 nightly rate. Essentially what he does is wait on the hut's porch until the hut's croo, who manage the hut, go to sleep. He then sneaks in to sleep on the floor. Sneaky and of help to anyone desperately trying to save some money.  DT was the next person we met. He's 29 and is hiking to Maine's border this year. He'll finish his AT adventure next year when he returns to hike Maine. He spoke of the freedom he has to complete the trail in sections, specifically highlighting that he enjoys himself when hiking out here or else he'll head home and return when he'll enjoy it. It was an interesting exchange given where I've been the last month and a half. It was an exchange I didn't prompt or influence.  Late in our hike today we met ""Dutchess of Slug"" and ""That Guy"". I told Dutchess about Slug coming north and how we were with him yesterday. I recommended that they discuss their family tree given their common names.  Which brings me to the frequently mentioned request for Beth to get a trail name. A trail name for Beth was a topic of conversation last year as Beth and I walked near our home for exercise. To be honest, this was my playful attempt to plant the seed for Beth to someday hike the AT with me. These conversations began before there was a meaningful plan to hike the AT this year. Among the suggested names back then were ""Arrow"" and ""Just Saying"". Arrow was proposed to recognize Beth's role and influence in our decision-making process on important decisions. We'd playfully argue who really made decisions. If you've been reading this journal, then Beth's role and encouragement for my continuing this thru-hike is readily apparent. I clearly wouldn't have been able to be here now without her support and active effort to keep my thru-hike dream alive. I readily admit that my bout with Lyme Disease and my cumulative weariness with the trail got the better of me. She's pointed and nudged me to keep hiking - all in a positive, supportive way. I'm grateful and will say again how lucky I am to be married to her. During today's hike, she used a phrase she uses a lot. I'd proposed it to her as a trail name last year. This proposed name is ""Just Saying"". It is a phrase she routinely uses to softly express her thoughts on numerous subjects. When I reminded her that I'd proposed it as a trail name last year and that Mark and others were wondering when she'd get a trail name, she said she didn't want one or think she should have one because she has no intention of hiking the AT. It was then that we joked about how many AT miles she's hiked this year and over recent years.  We never expected to meet Marvel today. We met her after moving a car to the end of tomorrow's hike. What began with my overhearing and inserting myself into a conversation about hiking gear led to an exchange of our trail names and recent hikes. Marvel and I never met before but I met her Dad and brother in Damascus. She just missed the feast that Fresh Ground and Blues Brother served up at Woodchuck's Hostel. It sounds like Marvel's Mom may still be a reader of my trailjournal. I asked Marvel to ask her Mom to sign in on my page and pass along info about Marvel's hike. Now I see that Marvel has her own trailjournal so I will be able to follow her journey myself. It was flattering how happy Marvel was with our conversation today. As Beth told Marvel, it was our highlight of the day.  Beth and I take on Mt. Moosilauke tomorrow. It is often referred to as the ""Gateway To The White Mountains"". It is known to be a formidable hike. I'm continuing to hike and will continue to work on Beth accepting a trail name - I'm just saying.","NH 25A - Wentworth, NH - Mile - 1,780.6

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542117,"I was told by a couple hikers yesterday to not hike Mt. Moosilauke from the south. I looked up a few of my favorite hikers in trailjournals and sure enough 2 out of 3 hiked it from north to south. That was enough for me. So, for the first time on this hike, I hiked from north to south. What was all the fuss about? The north side of Mt. Moosilauke features numerous wooden steps bolted into boulders that are frequently wet because of the waterfall that is close to the steps. Today's forecast includes a thunderstorm warning that seemed to worsen overnight. Mt. Moosilauke is a reasonably challenging hike on a good day and it was apparent that this would not be a good weather day.  Most of the hike was vertical boulders. The wooden steps were bolted and Beth and I were glad they were there. Fortunately, the wooden steps weren't very wet. The waterfalls were beautiful and again made this hike worthwhile and special. Beth fell for the first time ever. She didn't get hurt; but a fall is disconcerting when it happens and you really don't know how or why you quickly went down. We hiked very slowly to be safe.  Surprise! We saw Teach & Steady near the summit. We hadn't seen each other for a bit but here we were. It was a memorable moment. Visibility was no more than 30 yards, if that. It wasn't raining but we effectively were in a moist cloud and we got wetter as we caught up and talked about this hike. The summit was just 100 yards away like they said. We briefly stopped for a picture taken by a Dartmouth Outing Club member who was at the summit to ask hikers to remain on the trails since this area is an Alpine area in which vegetation can be destroyed by errant steps.  It got warmer as we descended. We were surprised that the descent on the south side of the mountain was also steep, though admittedly it was easier than the other side of the mountain. Slug was coming up as we were going down. It was good to see him again but we learned he isn't feeling well. He has lost his appetite which is unheard of for a hiker. Despite not feeling well, he was very outgoing and great to speak with. Beth commented how much fun he'd be to routinely talk with on the trail. With the recent rain came swollen water crossings. Beth dipped both feet into a stream that was literally just 20 yards from the end of today's hike. She's such a trooper that she just took it in stride.  So we're in the White Mountains now. Hopefully the weather will clear so that we can see this spectacular area. I am trying how to figure out to hike through this area and am keeping an eye on the weather.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542260,"I'll admit being apprehensive about today's hike. I've read so much about the White Mountains being difficult that they have spooked me a bit. Today's hike was 16.3 miles which have been routinely hiked before and after my bout with Lyme Disease. But these are the Whites so my thinking going into today was that past experience is meaningless. Since it was 16 miles though I hiked solo. Beth is fine and I want everyone to know that her fall yesterday wasn't a bad one. She's fine.  My notes from my reading of previous years' trail journalists that I took notes on was that this hike was difficult due to its 16 mile length and due to the strenuous climbs and descents. References were made to putting your hiking poles away to enable hand-over-hand climbing and butt sliding. It was a long hike. There were many miles of New Hampshire boulders. New Hampshire boulders, at this point, seem to be very different from northern Pensylvania boulders. New Hampsire boulders are typically flat or rounded and they are securely lodged in the trail. New Hampshire boulders rarely hurt, they just slow me down. Northern Pennsylvania's boulders are pointed and lose. They hurt and they slowed me down. Today's trail had substantial sections of very large boulder slabs that lie next to each other to form steep trail. Hiking through these boulder slabs is done by either powering up the slabs (something I was only able to do a few times), hiking within the boulder slab gaps (I did this a lot), or by hiking on the edges of the boulder slabs and grabbing trees or tree roots to pull yourself up (I did this a lot too). It's rained pretty hard the last two nights resulting in a lot of wet trail. This day is near the top of the list in terms of the number of hours my feet were soaked. The trail's wooden planks around Harrington Pond were completely submerged but I walked on them since the alternative was trampling vegetation, vegetation that shouldn't be hiked on and vegetation that could be beneath an unknown depth of water. The water overwhelmed the trail in sections after the Lonesome Lake Hut too. The Cascade Brook bridge was previously washed away and my right foot went for a swim when it slipped on a wet boulder. My feet were wet enough that foot placement to avoid water wasn't a priority at times.  So this hike was fun. Why? Because trail like this is a continual puzzle that has to be figured out. All that rain water resulted in robust waterfalls and brooks; there were miles of hiking along their sides and embankments. The weather was clear today and the summits of Mt. Kinsman provided numerous views in all directions. I wouldn't continue to hike if I couldn't enjoy a day like this one.    I didn't see many hikers today. Maybe the bubble of southbound thru-hikers has passed. I saw a lot of people at the first White Mountain hut, Lonesome Lake Hut. Overnight guests here pay over $100 a night per person to sleep in a bunk in a shared room. The guest gets a commonly-shared dinner and breakfast. It seems like a lot of money to me to be here but the hut seemed to have many guests when I hiked by it.  Funniest scene today? After hiking by the Lonesome Lake hut. a young couple came hiking by me from the other direction. They were talking about weddings so that got my attention given Anne's upcoming wedding. I looked at them as they passed. She was wearing a string of pearls. Think I've seen a lot on the AT but that was a first. Guess I should make sure to have clean clothes the next time I hike by a hut.","NH 112 - North Woodstock, NH - Mile 1,799.7

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542448,"Today was a tough day. It started and finished tough and very little in between was easy. The Whites got me good today. Today was unusual too because for the first time in this hike I skipped forward. Why? I am trying to make the best use of the days before my family vacation next week. Huts replace shelters in the White Mountains. I couldn't get a reservation for the Lake of the Clouds hut which is an overnight stay for most thru-hikers. Most thru-hikers stay in the Lake of the Clouds hut doing 2 hours of work to sleep on the hut's floor and eat leftovers after the hut's paying guests are done with their dinner and breakfast meals. I couldn't see how the typical time I finish hiking each day could result in me getting ""work for stay"" nor did I like the idea of beginning to hike as late as 10:00 a.m.. So Beth and I came up with the plan of her picking me up at the Mt. Washington summit and then I'll return to that summit in a few days before my family vacation. In between the summit days, I'll hike the Franconia Notch miles I skipped forward today. Confused. I'm sure you are. I wrote all that to remember the reasons why I did what I did today. I don't recommend such a thing and couldn't pull it off without Beth wasting her time to make this happen.  Today's hike. Wow. The ascent to Webster Cliffs from Crawford Notch is tough. It's steep. There are boulders and slabs. There was a good bit of hand-over-hand climbing. And then the difficulty continued as Webster Cliffs provided views for a half mile. I worked very hard and had hiked very few miles. I became concerned whether I'd reach the Mt. Washington summit before the road closes to prevent Beth and me from driving down from the summit.  The weather started out great. Not too warm and clear enough to provide great views. Then clouds appeared over Mt. Eisenhower and I was never able to see Mt. Washington because it was completely hidden by clouds. Then the clouds started to darken and I began thinking that the tent and sleeping bag I was carrying might have to be used tonight. Hiking with such thoughts and working so hard made for a pretty unpleasant mindset. Working hard though eventually paid off. I reached the Mitzpah hut by 11:00 a.m. and was happy that half of today's hike was over. There were no options other than to keep working hard. And eventually that work paid off. There were no pictures to take in the afternoon because of the clouds. It was really a shame because there should've been continual picture opportunities given today's 5,000 foot elevation gain and Mt. Washington's summit at 6,288 feet. By the time I got to Mt. Washington's summit the fog was very heavy. Visibility during the last couple hours was 50 feet. Beth was hilarious and realized how funny she was commenting on how cold it was at the summit. Hilarious because she was in the Visitor's Center awaiting my arrival. It made for a good laugh and laughs were hard to come by today.  I am grateful to have completed today's hike safely and to not have experienced even worse weather today. One southbound hiker pointed out how better today's weather was than some recent days. It's good to appreciate what we have. Every day isn't going to be sunny and balmy.","Crawford Notch - Mile 1,843.7

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542641,"I was surprised by how tired I was at the end of today's hike. This was my first time sleeping in one of the Appalachian Mountain Club's huts. The AMC has 8 huts in the White Mountains. These huts exist instead of shelters and cost more than $100 per person for a bunk, dinner, and breakfast. The Croo here consisted of 5 college students or recently graduated college students. Each member of the Galehead Hut Croo had at least 2 years experience working in an AMC hut - they were an energetic and impressive group. Dinner was delicious. It was served family style and I ate considerably more food than anyone at my table, indicating that my hiker hunger, as it is commonly referred to, is still functioning. I ate dinner with the people in my bunk room plus a Dad from Connecticut who was here with his son and two nieces. The nieces were middle school aged and seemed to have loved today's hike. The woman in the bunk below me is Box Turtle. She's finishing the AT this year after doing a flip-flop hike last year when she did most of the AT before sustaining an injury. Also sharing my table and bunk room are a woman who needs less than 10 mountains before hiking each of New Hampshire's 48 4,000 foot mountains, a man originally from India who is hiking a couple days while his wife and children are in India, and a man from Montreal who arrived while dinner was being served exhausted from doing the same hike I did. Today's hike didn't start until 7:00, a really late start. It was raining and the forecast called for rain and possible thunderstorms. I don't want to hike in a thunderstorm but I'd never hike if I didn't hike on days when thunderstorms are forecasted. The rain intensified as soon as I began and it poured for the first hour. The trail was dirt-based with anchored boulders that could be used as steps or walked around. A number of hikers were coming out of the woods and going home due to the rain and it being Sunday. The first hour's climb required typical effort. I met 3 hikers at a trail intersection just as the rain stopped. One of the three got up quickly and said he'd like to hike with me for a while. His trail name is honey-do! and he said he wanted to hike with me because he could tell as I came up the trail that I was a thru-hiker. honey-do! successfully completed his thru-hike in 2009 and he was out doing the Pemi Trail for a week. We talked trail as we climbed. The conversation made me unaware of the climb. By the end of the first climb today the elevation had increased 2,400 feet. We emerged from tree line to an unexpected sight - views! The views weren't perfect but they were spectacular nonetheless. In some places, white clouds engulfed all but a few mountains whose peaks were above the clouds. The smiles on both of our faces were huge. Trees had blocked our view of the sky and because it had rained hard we thought clouds would fill the sky. Soon we were on top of Little Haystack, the first of several mountains to be climbed today. We were giddy. Today's hike was Franconia Notch, one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. honey-do! and I exchanged a high-five as we took in the views. Franconia Ridge wasn't showing everything it had to offer but what we could see was more than enough. First, we had a clear line of sight to the other mountains yet to be hiked - Mt. Lincoln and Mt. Lafayette. This Franconia hike is a 2.1 mile walk on the ridge between these mountains. Beth and I hiked here on a day hike several years ago. This is our favorite all-time hike. It can be hiked via non-AT trails in a loop. I hope to someday hike this loop with Anne, David, their loved ones, and all my relatives who like to hike. When today began I wasn't feeling badly about Beth not hiking with me because it was raining and I thought there would be no views. Now, I started feeling guilty about Beth not being here and was a bit disappointed with the realization that she would've loved this. honey-do! and I took it all in. Today's pictures don't do the views justice. We came upon 3 Plymouth State college students and shared the scenery with them as we leap-frogged the ridge line. We ate lunch around noon on Mt. Lafayette and afterwards I hiked on to the next mountain on this spine, Mt. Garfield. I've never hiked north of Mt. Lafayette before today so it was all new. Rain clouds darkened the sky as I hiked into trees between Mt. Lafayette and Mt. Garfield. I emerged from the trees and was able to see behind me the mountains I'd already hiked. I was pretty happy and thankful for such a view. Another 30 yards later was an opening in the trail that showed further ascent was required for additional viewing. IT WAS INCREDIBLE! I had 360 degree views from Mt. Garfield's summit. These views were missing from today's previously hiked mountains but now I had them. The camera button was pushed many times today. The hike, other than the ridge line, was either up or down. The downs were steep for the most part and, for me, required 3 points of contact. It was slow. It was tiring. But there had been no thunderstorm, nor additional rain for that matter Can't wait to get back here again and again.","Mt. Washington Summit

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542715,"Dark clouds early, another problematic forecast, thunder in the late afternoon - they were all there today, but fotunately no rain or lightning all day. And it was something of an easy day. A day I needed.  The climbs up South Twin Mountain and Mt. Guyout were typical of the AT. Climbs like these are expected, particularly in the White Mountains. The afternoon finish after Zealand Falls Hut weren't expected at all because they were on the easy side for the AT and stood out as a significant exception for the Whites.  Like yesterday, I noticed a few stealth tent sites. I'm beginning to think that the stealth sites exist in volume in New Hampshire in opposition to the expensive AMC huts. Most of these sites don't have nearby water sources so make sure you carry adequate water if you'll use a stealth site. A real benefit of these huts is the great food. I stopped in for lemonade and a pastry. Lots of other hikers were there doing the same thing. Access wasn't great at the Galehead Hut and was non-existent at the Zealand Falls Hut and today's hike. It made for a tough time since Beth and I needed to finalize our plans for this week. It makes me realize how much easier these past few weeks have been since we've been together every day for at least a portion of the day.  Realized a milestone was passed yesterday or today. I never would've imagined taking 1,000 photos on this trip. I've met some amazing people and seen some amazing scenery. Must say that I'm totally surprised by all these photos.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542896,"I turned around less than 100 yards from Mt. Washington's summit. In that short distance I had slipped on wet boulders a few times and almost fell twice. Worse, I couldn't find the AT trail. The fog and mist were so thick that I couldn't see the next cairn to know where I should go. When I realized I had gone 30 yards off the trail in such a short time and felt I'd probably get lost again, I knew hiking further this morning was not advisable. I didn't like turning back but those 100 yards took 15 minutes. I knew I had no chance of finishing this very difficult 13.5 mile hike today. I turned around in order to avoid being hurt. I was pretty convinced that hiking by myself in these conditions was going to end badly. It was just 15 minutes, but nobody else was out around me. I found Dexter, the informative Mt Washington Auto Road driver who had driven me to the summit earlier in the morning, and he said he'd drive me down as soon as he had another passenger to join me. Dexter said it would probably be an hour or more. He encouraged me to wait in the Visitor's Center. So I went there and changed out of all my winter hiking clothes. I actually was wearing more layers today than I'd worn at any time while on this adventure, more than worn in the middle of February. There is a Hiker Room downstairs at the Visitor's Center so I checked it out. Blue Ox and Bibo were there. They had just hiked the 1.5 miles from the Lake Of The Clouds Hut. I told them of my failed experience and they shared that they had formed an 8-person line to overcome and hike through the conditions. I realized how much sense that made and how I'll have to find a group to join if the summit conditions are the same when I come back after family vacation to hike past the summit. Upstairs I met Trillium, her daughter, and her co-worker. They too had just hiked from Lake Of The Clouds. They said they benefitted from hiking together. They originally planned to hike on to hike another 5.7 miles to Madison Spring Hut but were aborting that plan and foregoing their paid overnight there to head home today. They mentioned Dexter and that they'd be taking the shuttle down so I stayed with them and we talked about our hikes. Nice people who are section hiking some miles each year and placing an emphasis on always enjoying it while they are out here.  Dexter drove us down. The weather was dramatically better the lower we got. We had views of the lush green scenery around us. Dexter has made this drive countless times since he began driving the Auto Road in 1999. Dexter freely shared his knowledge of the history of Mt Washington. Riding with him provides a guided tour customized to our interests. As I was leaving, Dexter told me to look him up when I return and that he'd get me back up there again to continue my hike. We all wished each other safe journies. The comraderie of this shared journey and appreciation for it is real.  Driving home today made me realize how far from home I've hiked. I am now 4 hours north of Connecticut. How did this all happen? I'm grateful that it has.","Mt Washington Summit - Mile 1,856.2

If you've preciously read this quest to hike the AT then you already know all about Beth. How she's made all the difference in my quest. Many of you know how she's made my life what it is. I am lucky. My daughter and son are lucky. Many of you are lucky too. Thanks to Beth's Aunt Vail for introducing us 40 years ago. Can't imagine where I'd be without her in my life or on this AT quest.  So where am I? I am at home. When I started this hike on February 16th, it was my hope that I'd be hiking Mt. Katahdin this week. Then, when I broke my finger hiking and had to have my wedding ring cut off, I hoped that today would be the day that I'd put that repaired wedding ring back on for good. So a lot has happened along this path. I am heading off to vacation with my family for our vacation. It's a time we've consistently come together. It's a time I'd never consider missing. I've been busy yesterday and today attending to a bit of this and that - Anne's wedding details, visits to my doctor and dentist, and catching up on a few home responsibilities. I am keeping track of my friends on the trail and figuring out ways to finish the remaining 333 miles. Some of those miles are as difficult as any on the AT. I intend to return to the AT in early August.My future is filled with many opportunities. I am loved by and love many. I have been and am very, very lucky.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544226,"I am back on the AT today. Vacation is over. Boy is that an understatement. Hiking 17.0 miles today was tough, all the more difficult because they are New Hampshire miles. The great news is that I am hiking again with Subman and Suds. We last hiked together in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. It was fun to reminisce with them about some of our past miles and to hear some about their hike when we weren't hiking together.Still, the hike today was a hard return to the AT. I am just not in shape the way I was before my bout with Lyme Disease. The trail today was pretty descent with lots of dirt-based trail. Thrown in though we're some pretty steep sections of slabs, going up and down. The afternoon climb of Mt. Success was particularly draining but putting one foot in front of the other eventually got it done and Subman and Suds were kind enough to wait for me at Mt. Success's    summit. Another highlight was crossing the border into Maine. But, what a greeting. Maine started off with a very difficult descent that didn't last long but it was as difficult as anything experienced so far. Hope the rest of Maine isn't like this but I fear that the next 100 miles or so will prove to be of similar difficulty.So how did I get here? The temptation to hike with Subman and Suds was too great so I skipped 33 miles of New Hampshire. My intention is to hike to Katahdin and then return to hike those skipped miles. Right now I'm thinking I'll make up those missing miles by returning and starting in Gorham like I did this morning, except that I'll hike south instead of north. By hiking south, my finish of the AT will be Mt. Washington, a challenging climb for the finish and a place where Beth can meet me to celebrate completion of this hike. That assumes I can successfully hike Maine. I feel a bit sad about jumping around like this but thought it would be the most enjoyable way to continue hiking. For now - and admittedly possibly feeling a bit too confident about all this because it is easier said than done - New Hampshire, I'll be back!","Gorham, New Hampshire

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544354,"Today was TOUGH! It was expected to be tough and exceeded my expectations in terms of how difficult it was. I was probably tired from yesterday but I think today would've been hard even if I was completely rested. Mahoosuc Notch is referenced as the hardest or most fun mile on the AT. I suspect that Subman thinks it is the most fun while Suds and I think it is the hardest mile so far. Mahoosuc Notch's reputation is richly deserved. It is set between two mountains. My understanding is that the mountains collided and created this notch with huge boulders dropped by the two mountains. I'd read that the boulders were the size of school buses but I don't think many were that big. What was there were plenty big enough and the boulders had to be carefully climbed and then used to reach the next boulder. This was by far the most hand-over-hand climbing to date and there was some sliding down on my butt to reach the next boulder too. I can't imagine hiking it by myself. Subman led the way and talked through how he managed from one set of boulders to the next. Suds was great and went out of her way to let me know about specific crevices or tree roots used for hands or feet. It took us a little two hours to hike this one mile - it seemed like it was never going to end. Strong hikers and rock hoppers will love it. I was glad not to have fallen. The hike before Mahoosuc Notch was hard too. I slipped on a round stepping stone and quickly fell. Fortunately I wasn't hurt. I think we were all tired by the time we began Mahoosuc Notch. My goal today was to stay with Subman and Suds and not hold them up. We leapfrogged a few times but I was able to keep pace with them up to Mahoosuc Notch. Total hiking time today was about 8 hours for almost 8 miles. Rain was forecasted and held off until we finished Mahoosuc Notch.   A campsite exists at the north end of this notch and we all agreed that the smart thing to do was not attempt to climb Mahoosuc Arm today. Subman thinks Mahoosuc Arm may be the hardest mile on the AT so we'll tackle that one tomorrow with the hope that the rain will end before then. The campsite is filling up now and I think we're all glad to be safe and dry since we had time to set up our tents and have a hot meal before the rain began.Today's photos won't be available until another day since I don't have Internet access here in the notch. While talking with Suds today as we hiked I shared with her some of the terms Beth and I use as quick descriptions. A ""Greylock"" view indicates being amazed that we hiked as far as we did in a short time and we realize this by being able to see the place we hiked from in the distance behind us. The ""Ramicone method"" is a term created by and skillfully used by one of our best friends in Pittsburgh. The concept Art Ramicone created is to do a task poorly enough that you'll never be asked to do the task again. I told Subs before we hiked Mahoosuc Notch that I envisioned ""Mahoosuc"" to become one of our terms to describe something that is painfully hard to accomplish. I'll see if Beth is willing to use that one since I'll forever remember today's difficult mile. While climbing today I passed a spotted frog that was trying to jump over a stone about 6 times its size. It made me smile as I stepped around it. Hope the frog made eventually made it. I know I'm glad to have made it too.","Carlo Col Shelter

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544469,"There should be a warning label in the AWOL Guide many AT hikers use - Do Not Hike This Section Of The Trail If The Trail Is Wet! It stopped raining around midnight and that was enough time for most of the trail to be dry. Today's trail was so steep and potentially unforgiving to make me shudder to think if I'd have survived if it had been wet. As it was, today's trail was again a lot tougher than I am and it had me wincing a good number of times.Today began with Mahoosuc Arm, a climb of 1,700 feet that many consider the hardest climb on the AT. My notes from past hikers indicated ""granite straight up"", ""trust shoes or grab"", and that one of these hikers fell backwards. I can understand these comments real well now and I felt good having access at the top of the Arm so that I could send Beth a message indicating we'd gotten through it and that we were all safe. Too dramatic, probably - but Mahoosuc Arm has a reputation and that's what I knew before today. Having hiked it now, I'd agree that it is exhausting. There are many long granite slabs so I can understand how easily a fall could easily happen here. Call me a coward - I opted for the ""grab"" method and used every tree branch or root available in lieu of hiking up the center of the granite slabs. It was a mental relief to reach the top and it was a relief physically too to realize that the toughest part of today was over. Wish that had been true.Old Speck is a climb I don't remember reading about. I suspect I glossed over what was written about this climb because it is only approximately 300 feet. Some in the shelter tonight were saying that the next enhancement to the AWOL Guide is to provide some sort of difficulty grading system. Old Speck was a tough one. Much of it was sheer stone that was fully exposed to that day's weather. Some felt it was dangerous. This climb came right after we descended to beautiful Speck Pond and ate some food as we felt good about completing Mahoosuc Arm. Neither Subman, Suds, nor I saw this one coming and it seems that made it all the more difficult to be confronting another mental and physical challenge so quickly.We then got a break as we descended to Grafton Notch. The trail was a throw-back to descents in other states. Trail that enabled taking full strides and enjoying the green woods around us. It was delightful. There are two Baldpate peaks, an east and a west. The good news was the Maine blueberries that were plentiful. The reality was that this was another physical and mental challenge as we climbed 2,300 feet and descended 1,600 feet. Our look at the AWOL Guide made us seriously consider ending our hiking day at 2:00 and tackling this in the morning. We were pretty beat at that point. It was a split decision to continue hiking. Hikers at the shelter before this climb spoke of the challenging parts but highlighted the great rock steps enabling Baldpate West Peak. Those rock steps were killers. Think of that innocent looking white bunny rabbit near the end of Monty Python & The Holy Grail. Yes, they were skillfully presented rock steps - but they just wouldn't end. I soon was regretting my vote to continue today's hike. This was tougher than I expected and this was touted as the good part of the Baldpate peaks. We'd been warned about the transition between the peaks. Exposed steep slabs with no trees to grab. This was a considerable challenge for someone like me who is afraid of ledges and exposed terrain. Fortunately, the rock is very grippy and our shoes didn't slide as was feared. And then came the views - incredible views. Views I want to remember forever. This reminded me of Franconia Notch and it's breathtaking scenery. Baldpate had 7 ridge lines in one direction and views of expansive valleys reminiscent of McAfee Knob. As we confronted our fears on this climb, I kind of forced Suds to stop as we clung to the exposed stone. I felt we needed to take all this in because we earned these views today and they shouldn't be taken for granted. The ascent was on the scary side. The descent was too. But those views were in incredible. I was so glad to be sharing this peak with Subman and Suds, it reminded me of incredible views shared almost 6 months ago. Fun today? Lots of it. I hope I'll remember that playful chipmunk at Grafton Notch that came so close to us scavenging food. It's probably still there now. Or how about those birds that seemed to be so close to me that I jokingly said that the animals didn't fear me and approached me like they did Snow White. Earlier was the harmless snake that was vaulting itself down rock steps as I began the Old Speck climb. Then there was the rabbit on the trail on our way up Baldpate West Peak. The animals are coming out. Two days ago we saw a moose as it went bounding away from us. Is this really just my 3rd day being back with Subman and Suds? A lot of great memories are being made. Including tonight's bear hang toss. I was awful. I'm sticking with my claim that this was ""the worst tree on the AT"". After finally tossing my rope line successfully over the desired branch (Subman tossed it), I let go of the end of the line so the toss was for naught. It was entertaining. You had to be there for that one. Suds may still be laughing and Subman said I was hopeless.I'm having fun - again with my trail family. I'm routinely exhausted. I'm admittedly afraid at times by the challenges this trail presents. Easier would be a welcome change, but we can't choose what's ahead - we just have to hike it as it comes.We're heading into East Andover tomorrow morning to resupply our food and get clean. I again don't have access tonight to get this posted but should have access tomorrow so pictures and the journal should be able to be caught up then.

It was over before 9:30 a.m.. Subman, Suds, and I got picked up and taken to Pine Ellis Lodging in Andover. Tonight's resting spot is a short walk to food options to eat today and stock up for future hikes. Beth previously dropped off a supply box for me so I didn't need to buy much to put in my backpack. I did take advantage of eating in town. First stop was Little Red Hen for a breakfast that was delicious and filling. A few hours later I went to Andover General Store for a pulled pork meal that was more than I could eat. I'm eating as much as I can to give my body the energy it needs to keep taking on Maine's tough trail.  But today was more than resupplying, laundry, and filling up on food. It was about people too. I had a good conversation with Hooshr before we started today's hike. Hooshr and Forrest have been leap-frogging with Subman and Suds since Virginia and it was good to spend some time with them today and hopefully get to know them better in the days to come. Both Hooshr and Forrest regularly post in trailjournals so look them up. Also seen today were Slug and Tuna Roll. The BIG surprise though was when Sprout and Smudgy Cheeks walked in while I was eating breakfast. I was hoping to see them again and soon Bubbles stopped over too. After breakfast I had more time to spend meaningful time and discussion with Bubbles. Bubbles is one of those amazing people on the trail from the perspective of feeling and searching for what the trail is all about. I really enjoy her husband (Sprout) and her brother (Smudgy Cheeks) too. Bubbles and I previously swapped contact info so that we can keep tabs on each other.

When I spoke with her last night I was more than a little concerned about today's hiking plan. But today's hike was successfully completed as was hoped. I am confident about morning climbs. It's the afternoon climbs that concern me.The first climb was Wyman Mountain. It was 1,400 feet but spread over several miles so it wasn't steep. In fact, it was on trail we haven't seen for a while - dirt and pine needles. Rocks were there, but they were manageable and Subman, Suds, and I breezed through the climb. The 1,800 foot descent similarly wasn't a problem. My concern involved the rest of the day. Fortunately, we started hiking at 6:15 so we were done with the 7.5 miles of easy stuff by 10:30. Next up was Moody Mountain, a climb of almost 1,400 feet in 8/10ths of a mile. Elevation changes of 1,000 feet or more are considered steep so this was a steep one. In fact, it started with almost 1,000 feet in 4/10ths of a mile. I finished our food break and headed out by myself wanting to get ahead of Subman and Suds so that they wouldn't be held up my hiking slowly up the climb. Well, surprise. The Moody climb and descent came and went and were done by noon. We were all feeling good. I was very relieved and had the ability to call Beth from the summit so I let her know I was doing okay.I was well underway with the last climb of the day - Old Blue Mountain. The steepest part was done - almost 600 feet in 1/2 mile. Subman and Suds passed me while I was talking with Beth. Shortly thereafter I could tell I was hitting a wall. I was struggling and that's how it went for the final 1,400 feet in 2.3 miles. Old Blue Mountain crushed me. I still don't know why. I just know that it did.On the way up I had a ""Fresh Ground"" sort of experience. A southbound hiker passes us and then stops, turns around, and asks if the two in front of me are Subman and Suds. What can I say - I hike with celebrities. The southbound hiker's trail name is Blue. Blue also posts on trailjournals and recognized them from their photo on the site. Blue did say that we had more rocks ahead so I was warned at the time.Subman and Suds were kind and waited in the sun at Old Blue Mountain's summit. Mike from Canada came by southbound resulting in a few extra minutes of rest. When I stood back up I realized that I hadn't even taken this summit photo yet. Pretty sad - and unusual - it just showed how whooped I was.  Subman found us a great stealth site that is big enough for our tents to be side by side. A few feet away is a small site that Old Fox was able to set his tent up in. Our hiking day was done by 3:30 and we'll sleep among pine trees tonight. It makes one feel like a hiker.So on the way up Moody Mountain, Subman was close enough to catching me to call out and ask whether I go to dog track races. I answered that I'd never been. Subman then told me of the mechanical rabbit that is used there and is chased by the greyhounds. Subman said he felt like a greyhound. It was a kind gesture. Subman and Suds can hike circles around me. But it made me feel good today - until Old Blue crushed me.","East B Hill Road - Andover, ME - Mile 1,932.2

Oops, this morning I noticed the sign included a ""1.5 miles away"" notation. So when I get internet access I'll reduce yesterday's mileage entry. What did that mean? Add an extra 1.5 to today's desired ending location. Subman jokingly said it deflated him. And I responded that you can't lose something you never had. So off we went. It was a bit deflating. We had a lot of miles to hike today and we just couldn't get into gear. The climbs weren't really steep or long but I was really struggling with the first climb. It was hot today so that may have contributed to our lack of pace and rhythm.We kept on plugging away. That's really all we can do. Guess Subman was full of the quotes today. This one was his ""The AT won't hike itself."" Suds led the way while Subman took a bathroom break. I heard Suds speak with Stripe. Now that wasn't expected today. Stripe stopped at last night's camping site and talked with us for a while - real nice guy that I met a few weeks ago. Last night Stripe left us with the intention of hiking another 5 miles to the next shelter (Maine calls shelters ""Lean-tos"" if anyone wants to be precise). Apparently Stripe did hike to that shelter. Then he woke up this morning, used the privy there on the way out, and started hiking south - unintentionally. Stripe said he'd been hiking hard for the last 1.5 hours. He took it in stride and turned around, leap-frogging us throughout the day.Bemis Mountain brought us grief but then brought us lots of wild blueberries. Bigger than we've seen before. Very tasty. Yes, we had a long day of hiking ahead of us but we took several stops on the summit and as we descended to enjoy these treats. Water wasn't readily available today. A spring where we hoped to get water was dry. We asked and heard from southbound hikers that the Bemis Lean-to was dry too. A liter of water weighs 2.2 pounds. I'm an odd one who carries 2 liters at the start of each day. There's a saying that ""you carry your fears"". I don't want to run out of water. It continued to be hot. There were no cooling breezes today. We ate lunch at Bemis Stream. The AWOL Guide indicates it has to be forded - not today, but at least it had water so we all drank our fill around noon. I went out first after lunch but everyone quickly passed me. It was just that kind of day. Subman got some energy from the lunch break    and there was a good distance between everyone else and me for awhile. That distance of separation ended with Suds yelling out where they were - in Sabbath Day Pond. It has a sandy beach that is just a couple feet deep out 100 yards. Stripe was up to his neck in it, sitting on his butt. The rest of us waded in too. It was very refreshing. Consideration was given to staying at the lean-to that was just 3/10ths of a mile away but that would've reduced our town time tomorrow and we all are looking forward to the customary eating, hydrating, and resting frenzy. So we hiked on. Tired. We reached our destination a little before 5:00. We're on a pond (Maine calls them ponds; many of us refer to them as lakes). We're glad we're here. It's less than 5 miles to the road where we can be picked up as part of the fee for staying at tomorrow's lodging location. One week ago today I was riding waves in the Atlantic Ocean with family and loved ones. Today I waded in a pond. Lucky to be able to experience both and to tuck them away to be remembered in the coming years. There are 3 canoes near tonight's water source near the Little Swift River Pond. One canoe has a gash in it while the other two appear to have been patched. There's an oar and a couple partial life vests. Stripe is heading out on the pond in one of them. He said ""What can go wrong today?"" Stripe just let me know he got a reservation for a bunk where Subman & Suds are staying. I think Old Fox, Hooshr, and Forrest intend to stay there too. It reminds me of our gathering at Woodchuck's Hostel in Damascus on Good Friday. Beth is coming too. It's nice that some things don't change.","Stealth Site Before Bemis Stream Trail Sign - Mile

Here today with us are Subman & Suds, Stripe, Hooshr, and Forrest. They all post in trailjournals so she knows them from their posts too.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544985,"Maine is so beautiful. I was stunned last night as I looked out the dining room window to see a pond (lake) view that belonged in an artist's painting. Today's hike provided a gallery of an artist's work. I review the AWOL Guide every night to consider the challenges presented in the next day's hike. We frequently say that the next enhancement needed in the Guide is a ""level of difficulty"" component of the trail. I realize now that during this review I am not considering the beauty I am about to see as I seem to be solely focused on what it will take to complete that hike. The photo icon used to designate the opportunity to take a great photo is lost on me and I realize now that I can and need to change that in order to enable me to be excited about what will be witnessed the next day. This hike provides so much more than a physical and mental challenge.   I was concerned about the physical demands of today's hike. My notes included ""toughest hike so far"", ""numerous falls"", ""almost stopped"", and then the most hopeful note ""steep, but made good time."" See what I'm getting at in terms of my preparation neglecting to consider the next hike's beauty? No wonder I'm tired. I scare myself to death before going to sleep each night. The weather was great today. It was cool throughout the day and there were times I easily could've put on a jacket. It was perfect hiking weather. We didn't envision hiking too many miles today so our pace was relatively easy after Beth dropped us off at the trailhead. Guess I'm never going to get over Beth waving goodbye. Today's wave reminded me of my Mom being heartbroken. She tearfully waved to me as she and my Dad drove away after dropping me off at college. I had little say in where I went to college. All my buddies went to the University of Illinois while I went to tiny, faith-based Grove City College. Would I make out okay there? Would I make out okay today? Beth has an incredibly beautiful smile and it was beaming as she drove by me this morning. So I was pretty quiet this morning as the hike began. I was soon lagging behind Subman and Suds and wondering - okay, now I can't even keep up with them when I'm fully rested and nourished. Like that first college day, face whatever is in front of you - there is no other choice. So lucky then and so lucky now. Old Fox is creating his own ""trail magic"" as we hike and he falls into line to hike with us. After a few more minutes, I'm hiking with Old Fox in the lead and then he's gone because he's too fast a hiker for me. My legs and arms are working hard to get me up the initial climb. Then the reality hits that the ""real"" climb up Saddleback Mountain hasn't started yet. Today's first few miles around some ponds are puny in comparison to what is coming. Great - I'm flunking out before even beginning.And then my day turned. First it was Ethel Pond. Didn't see a moose, but didn't have to. These Maine ponds are beautiful in their simplicity. A few minutes later was Eddy Pond. It's too bad I don't have the skill to display in a photo the beauty scene through the trees when a pond or some other vista is visible. I frequently have phenomenal obstructed views of landscapes that will exceed everything after I return home when this hike ends. Before starting the ""real"" Saddleback Mountain climb, I see a side path that takes me to an unobstructed view of Eddy Pond. It doesn't disappoint but I quickly return to the trail. The ascent seems reasonable now. I've climbed like this in so many states that it's no big deal. Saddleback Mountain reveals itself in layers. I've mentally been calculating how much more of this 1,500 foot climb is ahead. Subman emerges from a thicket behind me and I ask if we're near the summit. Neither of us thinks this climb is over - and it wasn't. Saddleback flattens out with ripples of stone requiring more work that I happily endure. Except when looking straight ahead, I'm now able to look in any direction to see valleys, ponds, mountains, and mountains beyond those mountains. Suds passes me too. But we eventually reach Saddleback Mountain's summit and congratulate each other as our celebratory photos are taken. After taking it in for a few moments, it's time to resume hiking. Next up is The Horn. We descend 500 feet and then reclaim it. The trail's outline is evident. The path is similar to the spectacular Franconia Ridge walk. We have this almost all to ourselves. How that guy running up and down this path is doing it defies my imagination. There's an occasional southbound hiker but not many. It seems this trail may be one of Maine's secrets. It is Sunday. Trail like this in other states would have a lot more people on it than are here today. The Horn provides similar breath-taking views. Saddleback Junior did too. This morning's hike is nothing like I expected. It was much easier than envisioned. Maybe I was swept away by the scenery but the physical demand of today's hike seems cheap in comparison to what has been provided. We hiked to our hoped-for final destination of the day. We take a vote and decide it is too early to stop hiking. Let's get that ""toughest hiking so far"" 1,500 foot descent behind us. The descent wasn't difficult. Not having to hike in the rain or in wet conditions probably makes this hike very different than what one of my favorite trailjournal writers experienced a few years ago. We're stealth tenting on an old, forgotten road. Stripe joined us here   a few hours ago. We're all glad to have his company. Maybe I can hide a few rocks in his pack tonight so that he can't hike too quickly in front of us tomorrow. I hope to get to sleep soon. I was tired and quickly took a nap before writing this. Staking our tents on this former road was a bit difficult so we reinforced our stakes with rocks in the hope that they will hold. It seems there is a couple tenting near me now. They must've arrived during my nap. A distant noise was heard. She just asked her partner what that was. This path is getting substantial traffic. It isn't human. I hope whatever critters are going by have good night vision. Please don't loosen my stakes. I haven't had my tent collapse on me - yet.","ME 4 - Rangeley, ME - Mile 1,968.7

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545123,"We literally began climbing with our first steps on the trail this morning. The temperature was cooler than it has been.   The wind was loud. The combination cooled us and made for great hiking weather. Subman set the tone for the day and began at a 2 mile per hour pace. The pace continued with steeper climb up Lone Mountain. It wasn't even 8:00 yet and we'd hiked 3 miles and put one of today's several climbs behind us. The wind was more noticeable the higher we got. Stripe started after Subman, Suds, and I began but he caught up and hiked with us into the Spaulding Mountain Lean-To where we met a couple doing a flip-flop hike. They were bundled up in coats and said they thought it was around 32 degrees there last night. They looked so cold whereas we were hiking in t-shirts and shorts. Such a difference out here between sitting and hiking. Stripe headed out before I could put rocks in his backpack so I suspect he'll stay ahead the rest of the way.And that's what I wanted to mention today. The conversation is increasingly about the end of the hike. There routinely has been discussion about how tired, banged up, or hungry we all are. None of that is surprising and there's no part of that discussion in which hikers are regretting being here. The ""end of the hike"" discussion is about logistics. It's an odd feeling to think about, and now attempt to plan, how we get home. Nobody is walking back - okay, a few do turn around and do a ""Yo-Yo"" in which they hike back to Georgia's Springer Mountain starting point. We hear that the more difficult hiking will end sometime after Stratton. It's then that our miles per day may increase to the numbers seen before New Hampshire's White Mountains. The 100 Mile Wilderness section leads near our final destination of Mt. Katahdin and that is more than half of our remaining miles. It doesn't seem real but if we don't start thinking about it, we're going to be there without a way home. The thought of an injury or something that would prevent hiking to the finish are thoughts we don't consider. Some are adamant about having come so far that nothing is going to stop them from finishing. Within this discussion, mention is made or the question is asked about what will be done after the trail. This conversation comes up while we're hiking or as we share our rest times. It's a conversation that was never considered before.The Spaulding Mountain climb came and went. We had a fun conversation with a trio of women that call themselves the ""Bad Ass Hikers"". They were full of spirit and clearly were enjoying being out here. The decent from Sugarloaf Mountain was steep in parts. Suds and I carefully picked our way through the boulders and roots. The trail didn't expose us to open ledges where a mistake could be life-ending but a mistake on this part of the trail could easily break some bones.We had a nice lunch break after the South Branch Carrabassett River. This lunch was made memorable by the little mouse that hopped like a kangaroo near Suds. My notes indicated that there was a 6-foot, 12-inch board that had to be crossed to get over the South Branch Carrabassett River. In prior years walking on this board would've made me nervous because below it was raging water. The water here this year is pleasant but a fall here would've resulted in being wet and not much more.After lunch were the Crocker Mountains. I thought South Crocker Mountain was hard. Climbing it in the afternoon probably made it harder but I think climbing this 1,300 feet would be notably difficult first thing in the morning too. The incline seemed to require consistent exertion and then came some boulder sections that were pretty steep. I was relieved to reach this summit. The transition to North Crocker got me too. I was tired. But all that separated me from Stratton was a 5-mile descent so I decided to hike there to get town comforts. Moose are clearly active on North Crocker as their droppings were frequently seen on the trail. It was a long day by the time I got into Stratton. I don't know whether I would've hiked these miles if not for today's refreshing weather. Since I have Internet access while I'm in town, I'll be posting all the photos taken over the last couple days. As for when this hike will be done, all I can say is what one of my favorites (Ed Fairman) would sing when he would grace us with his voice and guitar in the late hours of an evening at New Wilmington Missionary Conference - the answer is blowing in the wind. I want to remember today's wind, it made my day.","Woods Road Past Orbeton Stream - Mile 1,982.2

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545179,"No hiking today. I came into Stratton last night knowing I'd here all day today. Subman and Suds decided to tent a few miles before Stratton whereas the benefits of a town won me over. I hunger for anything cold to drink or east. When Beth was here a couple days ago she brought a cooler full of fruit; watermelon seemed to be the biggest hit. Hooshr remarked then that he didn't even like watermelon as he enjoyed another piece.  That's how it is out here. The variety of food in my backpack isn't great. I've always been a picky eater and my poor eating habits have clearly weakened me. I had lost 26 pounds when I weighed myself while recovering from Lyme Disease. I put 12 pounds back on before resuming the hike. Big Guy, my father-in-law, said that he hoped I didn't eat everything in sight after the hike is over. Coming into anywhere that has cold drinks and food lead to me spending what I view as an insane amount on a variety of drinks. Last night I got my best deal yet - 2 64 ounce bottles of Gatorade for $3. The first gallon of gatorade was gone within 3 hours and I drank 3 bottles of cold grape soda too. I know that's crazy. I'm a spoiled eater out here. I routinely eat dehydrated meals by Mountain House that are very expensive but I eat them because I will eat them. Fresh Ground called me out a few months ago scolding me to only carry food that I'll really eat. Candlemaker spoke how he enjoyed tuna tortillas and I found I like them so I eat a few of those for lunch every day. Breakfast is my biggest problem. I choke down Pop-tarts. I actually like Quaker Chewy Chocolate Chip Granola bars but after eating them I'm wondering what I'll eat next. Too bad I can't get eggs out here. Getting into town in time for breakfast is a real treat. Estimates are that we burn close to 6,000 calories a day hiking. Hikers typically carry a little over 2 pounds of food per day to replenish about half of our lost calories. We make up the difference in towns when we disproportionately eat until we are stuffed.Among the food memories I'll never forget is me coming out of town with leftover pizza. I was stuffed at that point and uncharacteristically was not eating the pizza crusts. I think Who-Dat was the first to notice what I wasn't going to eat. He managed to only get one of the three crusts because Blues Brother and another hiker jumped in to each grab one. Then there was the moment of laughter as one of my hiking buddies offered us some chips. When we asked where they came from, he revealed that they were from a nearby trash can. I passed on them but he said they were pretty good and scarred them down.So I have a few hours of town time left today. Cold soda and Gatorade are on the agenda tonight - along with how I can figure a way to carry out some cold watermelon.","ME 27 - Stratton, ME - Mile 2,000.9

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545338,"This is supposedly the last day of strenuous terrain in Maine. Today's hike certainly was consistent with what Maine has shown so far - one challenge after another. Don't get too satisfied with whatever aspect of the hike was just completed because the next one is beginning. But there was a difference today. The trail seemed to be working with me instead of against me. I could step where I wanted to step; crevices existed for me to grab hold.Subman, Suds, and I were ready early and were able to be driven to the trailhead so that we started hiking before 7:00. Unlike most trailheads that start immediately with an elevator-like initiation in which there is an immediate climb of several stories, we had a comfortable break-in stretch that didn't take our breath away. Bigelow Mountain was the first climb - a climb of 2,000 feet. It's here that I began feeling the trail not fighting me. Maybe it was all in my head, but Suds mentioned the day feeling melancholic to her - a feeling I could relate to. My Dad played youth baseball. He was a catcher and it sounded like he was pretty good. I remember him telling me that he sensed he had a good rapport with his pitchers and could direct the placement and type of pitch to get batters out. He began getting attention from a baseball scout before being injured. When he returned from his injury, he said he lost the ""feel"" to call the game and he never advanced as a player. One of his team's names was ""Dirty Dishes"" - I always thought that was a cool name. So why mention this? Because as I hiked today, I thought I had the feeling for climbing like my Dad had to call pitches. The next step orhandhold seemed to be there and set me up for the next one and so on and so on. It was an enjoyable sensation as it played out. Maine - you are incredible! Another round of 360 degree views. Another ridge walk. It was hazy but the clarity periodically was there to fully embrace and view the valleys and ponds so far below.I was concerned about how steep South Horn was based on its elevation profile in AWOL's Guide. For good reason. I smiled as I passed a sign that directed hikers to stay on the trail in order to preserve the fragile alpine pants. These signs routinely appear above 4,000 feet. In this instance though I wanted to yell at someone and say that I'll be happy to stay on the trail if the trail doesn't kill me. South Horn was an exposed summit with a substantial exposed climb to get to it. My fear of heights never kicked in to overwhelm me but Subman commented that he got a bit dizzy looking down. It was a long way down. Someone recently told Suds about a spot a few days ago where someone could walk off the mountain during night hiking and fall to their death. You couldn't pay me to hike South Horn at night or in inclement weather.Another memory of Dad came over me while descending South Horn. Dad loved setting up train tracks. He had a separate small room in which he proudly set trains to move around his prized Snow Village scenes. He built landscapes complete with tunnels and a few tiers. Below me were islands in Maine's ponds. There were trees on those islands and I was so high above them that I felt like I was looking at my Dad's handy work. As I hiked I realized being grateful for today's memories of my Dad. Triggers like those experienced today don't routinely appear but they were vividly evident today.So I'm passed South Horn now. This last day of difficult hiking in Maine is well underway now. Avery Peak is next. During a rest stop at a day use lean-to, we had a nice conversation with two southbounders - Dory and her hiking companion who is thinking about being named ""Sticks"". Dory said Avery kicked her butt. Great. We had a nice lunch spot. I started out and was stunned with how quickly the trail had become a boulder scramble of considerable difficulty. This climb though was just a few hundred feet so I knew the challenge couldn't last long. Descents are sometimes more difficult than climbs. We had a long one today. There have been more difficult ones than this, but it was long. The final climb up Little Bigelow Mountain was filled with surprises. Just as I thought this stretch must be the end, the trail dipped and turned, and then I knew it wasn't over. But there wasn't a sense of frustration today. I really think I had started today thinking that this was going to be such a tough day that I just went with whatever came. And that feeling of the trail working with me never went away as the day became late afternoon. Finally though, the views of Little Bigelow Mountain were mine. I took my pictures and sent Beth another message saying that all that was left was a 1.7 mile descent to tonight's place of rest. WRONG - there was another mile to get to Little Bigelow's Summit. Time to smile again. Today's hike finally ended. Will tomorrow's hike be easier? I hope so but if it isn't then so be it. At this point, I'm thinking that Mt. Katahdin's hike will definitely be a challenge. After Katahdin, I still have to return to hike the 33 mile White Mountains gap I skipped in order to hike with Subman and Suds in Maine. The White Mountains will be a challenging finish. Mark asked about the miles missed due to the fire in Shenandoah National Park. I asked about this back then and talked with many hikers too. It didn't sound like anyone was returning to hike that section. Those miles are considered done because hikers were there and were rerouted around the closed fire area in order to stay out of danger and to let those combatting the fire do their work. That last paragraph is meaningful to me. After Lyme Disease I wondered if I'd ever get back feeling positive about my ability to hike the entire trail. Before Lyme, I thought in terms of hiking ""x"" miles per week with the end result being completion of the AT. After Lyme, I couldn't believe how easily it was said that I had hiked so many miles already and that I ""just"" had to hike a few hundred more to finish. I've come to realize and appreciate how lucky I am to still be out here attempting to finish the remaining miles. Now, I feel fortunate to realize that the sense of feeling capable of finishing has returned.","ME 27 - Stratton, ME - Mile 2,000.9

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545407,"A fly landed on my shirt and drowned. That's what Subman said around 7:30 this morning after climbing a few hundred feet on something that hasn't even been given its own name. It was hot. It was humid. It was tiring. Where was this supposed easy trail? The climbs and descents weren't part of the trail today but rocks and roots seemed to be everywhere. It seemed that we had to scrap for most of the day. It was exhausting in this weather. Subman and Suds took the opportunity to cool off on the sandy beach of West Carry Pond. I was trying to figure out how to cross the Kennebec River.The Kennebec River is the one spot on the AT where hikers are asked not to hike. Instead, a free ferry service is provided to take hikers across the river. My problem was I couldn't get to the Kennebec before the ferry service ended today's crossings at 2:00. The AWOL Guide lists Cheryl Anderson as providing a few-based ferry service. I didn't have a telephone signal for most of the day but finally got one and arranged for Cheryl to take me across the river. We're asked not to ford this river because someone di trying to ford it. The Kennebec's current is already strong but a plant above the crossing releases substantial water as the plant's operator determines. The river swells as this water overwhelms everything in its path. Cheryl Anderson works absurdly hard for her $30 fee. I gladly paid it. Cheryl says she is one of 30 Caratunk residents who live here all year. She lives on the Caratunk side of the Kennebec and was able to see me when I arrived; in other words she was very flexible about the time I'd get there for the ferry. I was there when I said I'd be there but had some doubt about getting there in time because most of the trail after the Pierce Pond Lean-To required hard hiking through the rocks and roots over ups and downs. Getting across today gives me a chance to get to Monson late Saturday afternoon - a plan Subman proposed a couple days ago. As it is, there's still 30+ miles to hike to get there. Cheryl said that the trail gets easier as hikers go north of Caratunk. I wanted to tell her that's what I expected today.","Little Bigelow Lean-To

Rain - No!!!!One of these days I'm going to have it all - easy trail, great weather, great people everywhere - since I'm dreaming here, I'd like to see a rainbow and sleep under a sky lit up by the stars. Definitely not the day I had today. It rained for 3 hours in the morning and got everything wet. Maine needs the rain so there was an upside to it. I hiked by myself today. I'll be with Subman & Suds again in Monson in a couple days. The trail was easier today and it enabled hiking in full strides for most of the day. Hiking across Boise-Cascade logging road was special because I worked for newspapers for 36 years and Boise-Cascade was a big newsprint supplier. I listened to music to keep me focused on hiking at a pace that would get me far enough so that I can reach Monson after a full day of hiking tomorrow. I love my music and since I hadn't heard it in a long time it was a real treat. Pretty cool that k.d. lang's Hallelujah was triumphantly playing just as I was cresting the summit of Pleasant Pond Mountain. Want to remember the timing of that song. Of course, the rain intensified immediately a moment later with me laughing to myself how it just seems to be that kind of day. The trail was narrow after that almost 2,000 foot elevation increase. I love trail lined by small pines. I got such trail. Those pines hold raindrops well. It was like I was in a car wash with the water and brushes soaking the sides of the car. Every step was another blast of rain. The descent from Pleasant Pond Mountain is a long one. It has lots of granite, made slick by the rain and puddles. I only fell once and it was uneventful. But I saved myself twice from falling when I was out of control - got real lucky then and the countless times that my feet slipped to a nice landing spot.Not many hikers out today. My favorite was the red-haired Irishman who was thoroughly soaked and said he loved hiking in weather like this. Okay, I'm jumping out of sequence here. Debbie - those loons you love so much are loud at 1:00 in the morning while I'm writing this. I am tenting 40 yards from Bald Mountain Pond and saw several loons when I was getting my water. For the most part, they were quiet then. I'm enjoying them now while I write but hope they'll be quiet after I'm done so that I can get back to sleep. Stopping the rain that started falling lightly would be nice too. The climb up Moxie Bald Mountain was steep, particularly in the last 4/10ths of a mile. The summit was covered in clouds. It wasn't raining then but visibility was compromised after 40 yards. Finding the way off this summit was a challenge. I'll admit being concerned after my third pursuit failed. There was so much granite at the top. I couldn't find a cairn and there weren't any white blazes. I was glad when a young hiker arrived and mentioned to him that I couldn't find the trail. He said he was hiking south and came from the same cairn that brought me to the summit hiking north. I thought he was pretty confused and I could tell he thought the same of me. Five minutes later I yelled to him that the one cairn was commonly used to reach this summit. I found wood planks that would take me north and directed him to the granite slabs that would take him south. I don't recall hiking another summit like this that doesn't take us ""up and over"". This one instead took us up and then come down the same way for a brief moment. Very confusing. I mentioned my confusion to a hiker heading up to the summit and we drew a picture in the muddy trail. He appreciated the diagram and said he'd talked with someone last night who said they'd hiked for a half hour up there before realizing that they were not on the trail.Despite the easier trail today, I was tired when I reached tonight's resting spot of Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-To. I enjoyed eating with the other hikers here. BD (stands for Bad Decisions) is a young hiker from New Zealand who started his flip-flop in June. He says he's enjoying the AT. Squirrel is doing a long section and is heading north. She is full of information and stories. I can tell that she'd be a cohesive hiker in any group of hikers and wonder if I'll see her again in the next days to Katahdin or if she'll be so fast a hiker that she'll leap ahead. The two women are nice but did more listening than talking. The one is a Physical Education teacher in New Hampshire who hiked the AT with her daughter back in 1999. Wish I could've talked with her longer. BD was pitiful hanging his bear bag. It took him several tries and his bag is hanging so low that I think I could reach it on my tiptoes. Half the night is over and all is quiet now so I guess his food will be okay tonight. It's 1:30 now. The rain and the loons have stopped. Hope I can dream about seeing a moose in the grassy part of Bald Mountain Pond. I'll get my chance in the morning. All I need to do is roll out and scan the pond outside my tent. A beautiful sunrise would be nice too. Hey, this is my dream.","US 201 - Caratunk, ME - Mile 2,037.5

I was called ""Safe"" after two notable, out of control slides. My hiking poles saved me just in the nick of time. I would've been a ""pig in the mud"" dirty if I went down on the first slide. The sliding reminded me of my pathetic venture in Little League baseball. Aside from remembering that I was awful, my only memory is when the other team was short one player. Coach gave me to them for the day. I played shortstop for them even though I was hidden in right field for my team. I remembered the grin on the pitcher and the ribbing I took from the catcher. I don't remember it being particularly mean, just good-natured ribbing as I played against them. I hit a double first time up and got a single later. I had one error but caught the ball and threw it to second to start a double play. I remember my coach grinning and patting me on the back after the game as he complimented my play. Don't remember anything else about that experience except how much bigger and stronger everybody was. I love the memories that drift in while I'm hiking.My heart jumped a bit when I saw a rope strung across a river crossing. Would this require fording the river? I've seen numerous journal photos of hikers wading across rivers with running water above their knees. Nope. There was so little snow here last year and so little rain since then that I got across today's river crossings with water only up to my ankles a few times.Beth surprised me by picking me up at the parking lot after emerging from the woods. I spoiled her surprise. She was positioned to greet me immediately at the point that the trail came out of the woods. Except that I came out on the other side of the road and tapped on the window to let her know I arrived. It was nice not to have to find a ride into Monson.As we drove into Monson, I was surprised, but happy, to get a message from Blues Brother, who asked if I was arriving in Monson today. I told Beth he must be tracking me by reading my trailjournal posts but that I couldn't understand his getting an internet signal while he was in the 100 Mile Wilderness. We were confused where to enter the Lakeshore Lodging House & Pub where we were staying for the next couple nights. As wet and dirty as I was, it didn't seem appropriate to enter through the Pub's doors. A couple ladies to the doorway so we stepped aside. Then Blues Brother came after them. Beth was stunned. I was grinning and demanded a few high fives. Blues sprained his ankle real bad a few days ago. It is still swollen and has that ugly black & blue sign of healing. Blues explained his injury as I got another high five or two. Bad form to be happy about a hiker's injury but I was so happy to see him. He's one tough guy. He had to walk in on that ankle for 15 miles. Blues had another surprise. Spirit of 76 was here too. I was on cloud nine. Spirit came in and we started catching up. A familiar face came to our door. Now it was my turn to surprise someone. It was Stripe. He came to find Spirit. It was great seeing Stripe here as I thought he'd be too far ahead - another plus for Subman's 4-day hike plan from Stratton to Monson. Dinner was a joy. I'll admit being a bit saddened by previously not having a big dinner with my hiker friends. I didn't get a picture tonight - we were all enjoying ourselves too much. What an end to the last 4 days. And Beth is here with me to experience it. Incredible.","Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-To - Mile 2,056.7

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545746,"Subman & Suds arrived before 1:00. Plans have been made for the 100 Mile Widerness that we intend to complete in 6 days. Hard to believe we're here together. Subman, Suds, Spirit of 76 all met on Day 1 (February 16th). We've had different paths but here we are with about one week left to get to Mt. Katahdin. If you read this journal from the beginning then you know that Matt Briggs, who became Blues Brother, and I met at the Hiker Hostel before I started on the 16th. Blues and I didn't hike together until a shelter before Clingmans Dome but then we hiked together for more than 500 miles. Blues is here too. Stripe came down the stairs at Shaws when Subman and I briefly stopped there. So happy that he agreed to join us. So our ""bags are packed and we're ready to go."" We won't be leaving on a jet plane but instead will be driven to the trailhead by Beth after breakfast. She'll make a couple of trips there so that we can all start together. Like our journey so far, we'll probably get through this next hundred miles in various ways with different experiences and perspectives. Are we ready for this next section? Are we ready for this amazing journey to end? We'll soon see.Given that the 100 Mile Wilderness sign says this is the longest wilderness area, I doubt that Internet access will be as readily available as it has been. I'll send my journals to my daughter Anne as promptly as I can so that she can post them.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545847,"The 100 Mile Wilderness - It begins today. What will this fabled section be like? Well, it was like a lot of previously hiked sections. We didn't hike many miles today. But, we hiked close to where we intended to hike as discussed at the beginning of the day and we ended early enough to have the plenty of camp time so the day felt pretty good. Not that the day was all good for me. I fell twice today. I think the last time I fell twice in one day was back in Virginia. On a separate occasion, I rolled my right ankle as badly as has been done this while trip. So not exactly a great way to start this section from a physical standpoint. Blues Brother was leading Stripe and me as we were in the last shuttle driven by Beth to the trail. Blues told us that he was on slippery granite and while he successfully moved off it, Stripe fell down behind me. I felt I was in ""no man's land"" on this slippery surface and soon found myself on my side taking a slide down to the bottom of the granite. This fall registered as one of my worst falls. I hit my left hip pretty hard and rode down on it. The slide was short but sliding on granite isn't fun. No injuries though so that was good. The fall and slide reminded me of one of my few skiing attempts. In the early years after college, Beth and I went skiing with Rob Hughes, one of our best friends and essentially a member of our family from the perspective of how much time we spent with him back then and how much we love him. Beth hadn't skied before so she took a lesson while Rob and I went off with the intention of coming back after Beth's lesson. Rob and I got lost up in the trails. We knew we were in trouble when we noticed that we were the only skiers wearing blue jeans on a slope that made no sense for us to be on. We didn't know how to get off this slope so we gave it a try. I remember skiing backwards before falling and sliding. The worst part was when I realized I was only half way down the slope and would have to make a second attempt to ski off the slope. I remember Rob and I took so much time that the day was over by the time we got back to Beth. I remember she wasn't happy with me.Subman pulled a fast one on us today as he ""helped"" guide us back to the trail to get to the Leeman Brook Lean-To. Subman was above us and told us to back up and go through a boulder series in a valley between us. Moments after we got through it, we learned that there was a much easier way on the trail to get to the spot that led to the Lean-To. So we owe Subman and revenge will be sweet. The interaction between Blues Brother, Stripe, and I was good. When I could stay with their reasonably slow pace, the stories of our hikes to date were flying. It reminded me of the column hiking experiences with Blues, Fresh Ground, and Who-Dat. I fell too far behind for a few minutes and paid the price for it in the form of losing the trail for a good 10 minutes. In my defense, I was hiking on a path it just was't the AT. I backtracked to the last white blaze and saw a blaze to the left. It took me a while and for the two of them to take a break before I caught them.Blues said we'd have lunch in the other side of Big Wilson Stream at Mike 2,084.3. Big Wilson required fording across the stream and there was a rope to assist getting across. I thought I spotted a rock hop sequence down stream 30 yards and went for it. Boy was that a mistake. Not having hiked with Blues for a while, I had forgotten how much he likes to stick my AT purist pursuit to me. He actually videoed me doing the rock hop to negate my thru-hike. My rock hopping was not successful and I ended up with two feet soaked as I came out of the stream to the blaze on the other side of the rope. Well, the ribbing intensified and was pretty good. Stripe needled me pretty good too. A new hiker, Patriot, came across the roped area as the ribbing continued. Patriot joined in and said that I was now a section hiker having sectioned from Georgia to this Big Wilson Stream and assumed I'd now do a section from Big Wilson Stream to Mt. Katahdin. I'll never live this one down and Blues and Stripe now refer to it as ""The Big Wison"". I was already soaked and should've just sloshed back and forth to shut them up. Wish I was golfing so I could take a ""mulligan"".So we're in the ""wilderness"" when successive southbounders tell us about upcoming trail magic. Sure enough, Scout is in his cabin serving up hamburgers, hot dogs, and cold drinks. He's been doing this for a few years now in his son's memory, James Adams. Nice guy doing a nice thing for a good reason. Love the trail and such moments like this.Long Pond Stream required fording so the ""Big Wilson"" ribbing resumed, if it ever had really ended. We'd heard the water source at the Long Pond Stream Lean-To was dry so we tented alongside the stream tonight. Subman and Suds, Blues Brother, Stripe, and I are here. Spirit of 76 went to a shelter a few miles beyond our campsite. We'll be sleeping to the sounds of Long Pond Stream happily cascading over sun-bleached boulders. Wilderness Day 1 is a pretty good deal. I forget the movie and the exact quote but in honor of hiking with this military gang today - thank you sir, may I please have another.","ME 15, Monson, ME - Mile 2,074.6

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546000,"Today felt more like the wilderness than yesterday. We didn't cross a road until the last half mile. Then a nice young man came with Cokes as we were getting water from the Pleasant River. Was happy to have a Coke but his arrival made it seem more like another day out here than the perceived remote 100 Mile Wilderness. Today's trail was filled with boulders and roots. There weren't many photos to be taken. I like to get something more - a view, a waterfall, cascading water, something - than I got today for today's hard hiking. There were many climbs today and I'd say they were harder than most. The cumulative effect of all of them combined with numerous ups and downs over boulders made for a tiring day. My right ankle felt stiff and unreliable early in the morning but it seemed to improve as the day went on. It could be that my ankle got better as I got slower.Stripe was with us all day but forded Pleasant River to do another 5 miles while Subman, Suds, and I decided to camp before fording the river since tenting is allowed on our side but not the other. Stripe will now hike on without us in order to meet up with his sister and brother-in-law, who arrive on Saturday at a location a bit farther than the rest of us will get to by then. We are intending to summit Katahdin on the same day so we should see him again. We got a view of Mt Katahdin today. It seems so far away. We came upon a day hiker early this morning. He asked where we were coming from and someone said ""Georgia"". With a big smile on his face he said ""Wow!! Yup, it's pretty amazing to have hiked from there.","Long Pond Stream North of Road - Mile 2,088.8

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546044,"Today was a weird weather day. It rained most of last night so the trail was really wet. I got up before dawn to try to dry my tent. I soon learned from a sleepy Suds that Subman saw my light and got her up because of me being up and about. We were hiking by 6:00 a.m.. We had to ford the Pleasant River. The water was cold and the river bottom was slippery. To save weight, I had just given Beth my camp shoes so my trailrunners were soaked early. The trail no longer consisted of rocks and roots and instead had patches of dirt. We moved pretty well early on. I started the day hiking with Subman and Suds but they moved on when Blues Brother caught up to us after a few miles. He had me lead because his ankle is still giving him trouble. I'm slow enough when hiking as fast as I can to hike at a pace that allows him to not strain his ankle. We got caught up with each other about lots of subjects and fell into the familiar banter that reminded me of hiking with him many miles ago. I feel so lucky to be hiking with friends as this journey ends.There were a bunch of climbs today. None more than 700 feet but climbs that didn't seem to end. The climb up White Cap Mountain ended with us coming out of the trees into wild conditions. Blues and I talked about having lunch at White Cap's summit but once we got there all we wanted was to get out of there as fast as we could. The wind was ferocious. It knocked me around. My glasses became obstacles as they were filled with a foggy mist. Hiking on this rocky summit was no fun and I was lucky not to fall. White Cap is noted as being the last climb before Mt. Katahdin. It was memorable and sharing it with Blues will be something neither of us will forget.We made it to a shelter below the summit and caught up with Subman and Suds. We all spoke of how that climb and summit were challenging and were grateful that we all made it safely. It was a shame not to be able to see fantastic views that included Mt Katahdin. Patriot arrived and spoke of how much fun White Cap was; I love the youthful perspective and how it differs from an old one like me. Patriot said the sun was coming out this afternoon but that wasn't enough for me to put on a coat layer. I realized how I haven't needed a coat for a long time - so lucky and spoiled. The sun showed up just minutes after leaving the shelter. It became way to hot to wear a light layer and soon I was wishing for the cold summit winds.Suds wanted a big mileage day today in order to have fewer miles to hike tomorrow when we are scheduled to stay at an oasis in the 100 Mile Wilderness called White House Landing. It became a long day. And I wondered aloud how the climb up Little Boardman Mountain wasn't considered to be a substantial climb. Blues Brother gave voice to Fresh Ground's ""last climb of the day"" saying at a perfect time to bring smiles to our faces and to shut me up to accept hiking whatever is in front of me. The trail played peekaboo with Crawford Pond. Crawford Pond was gorgeous and it was a shame that we didn't stop there or tent alongside the trail in one of the stealth spots we passed by.We finally came to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-To. Subman reported that Stripe was here. What a pleasant surprise that was and I attempted to give him back some of the ribbing he'd given me for my ""Big Wilson"". I told Stripe that any hiker who hiked as leisurely as he did today had lost the right to criticize my hike.I barely had daylight to get all camping chores done but had a great dinner with Stripe. When we first met, Stripe said that he had read my journal to learn of trail conditions he'd be heading into. He said he wanted to catch up but couldn't because of the big miles I was hiking pre-Lyme. Then my time of recovery came and Stripe was passed me. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with Stripe. Wish we'd had spent more miles together but find myself grateful to be finding another friend so late in this hike.Miles. They are coming to an end. There's serous conversation about weather in the coming days. We all hope for a good weather day to summit Mt Katahdin. Including the 33 miles I'll have to hike after Katahdin, I find that even for me there's less than 100 miles to go now. We were all enjoying the information provided by two women at the East Branch Lean-To. Patriot told me of how they said they were lucky to soon be overcoming today's problematic weather because they'd be ending their outing in a few days. With a smile on his face, Patriot said that he'd soon be leaving the trail too.","West Branch Pleasant River - Mile 2,104.9

We hiked 14 miles that was primarily park-like trail that was periodically interrupted by rocks and roots.Our destination today was White House Landing, a place to enjoy Pemadumcook Lake where we can dry out, get food and supplies, and sleep in a bed. Pretty cushy for the wilderness. Getting supplies here let us not carry another 2 days of food before exiting the wilderness. Subman, Suds, and Blues Brother are here with me.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546250,"Today had a different feel to it than other days on the trail. It wasn't rushed. It just evolved in a comfortable way and it felt like this the whole day. It was wonderful.I got out of bed twice in the middle of the night to look at the stars and the full moon. Silly me, the full moon seems to prevent viewing the stars because of the bright full moon. Aracne was out the first time I checked the moon. Breakfast wasn't prepared until 7:30 so I slept in until after 6:00. So unusual. There was so much time to prepare for the day. It felt leisurely with time for brief conversations with many staying overnight at White House Landing. Breakfast was delicious. It felt good to see everyone and we were all in good spirits. I made inquiries about the fee to rent a cabin here with thoughts of a reunion or coming here with friends and loved ones. The morning was cool but the sun was out. It looked like the perfect weather day.Bill boated Subman, Suds, Blues Brother, and me back to the trail. I felt the trail slipping away while I was in the boat. The boat's wake drew a line in the water that dissipated over time. It seemed to be saying that you had it and you aren't coming back. It was like graduating from college. You've experienced and grown so much while you were there. The friendships and memories will last a lifetime but even if you return, it just won't be the same.As we docked near the trail, Blues Brother announced that he intended to hike fast today and that, if he was able to feel good and get into rhythm hiking, he may hike much farther than the 15 miles the rest of us intended to hike. He was soon gone. Will I seem him again? Did I expect to see him the last several days? It felt fine. Graduation, he was moving on.Subman set a pace that was very slow for him. I appreciated this pace. It didn't demand everything I had. We were able to stay in a line that enabled conversation, some of it was memories. The trail wasn't easy like yesterday. There were continual tree roots today. Like yesterday, it felt like fall. Leaves had fallen and sometimes hid the trail. The temperature was warm, but not uncomfortable. It wasn't humid and breezes frequently cooled us. Lunch was on Nahmakanta Lake. I looked for some smooth stones so that I could skip them in the water just like I did growing up at my Dad's parents cottage on Lake Erie near Dunkirk, Canada. Pizza leftover from last night was a treat. We continued to hike at a pace that wasn't strained for me. Subman was excited for Suds and me to see Mt. Katahdin from a 16 mile line-of-sight vantage point. It looked like the majestic monster I've seen before in pictures. Access was good here and I got to speak with Beth. Everything is falling into place for Beth to drive here for the Katahdin summit. Subman & Suds made reservations in Millinocket too.Blues Brother etched some Rabbit ""go here"" pointers on the trail. Subman etched his hearts for Suds just like he did many months ago in the snow. Subman and Suds etched a Rabbit in the trail so that I wouldn't miss the trail's turn. We spoke with various hikers throughout the day. It was fun to meet Mustard Seed, who I'd heard about before. And to see Abby and her hiking companions, who I'd briefly met before.We reached our destination before 5:00. Squirrel arrived. Then Sunshine and Moonshine. Then two hikers from Connecticut that we'd met at the last shelter. And then Spirit of 76 and Aracne arrived.Spirit set up her tent within talking distance of mine. Squirrel did too. Conversation ensued between us in bits and pieces. Then Aracne came down to eat dinner with Spirit. And we talked about the trail and how we were feeling about where we've been in self-reflective terms. We talked past hiker midnight.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546467,"We came out of the 100 Mile Wilderness today. After speaking with others today, it seems I was in the minority who thought today's hike physically was easy. The tree roots were extensive but our group is here tonight.This trail's many miles have given us so much but have also given us various aches and pains. My right ankle squawks whenever I step a certain way on a rock or root but this is relatively insignificant and I feel very fortunate. I haven't fallen on the trail the last couple days but I've seen others fall. We're all aware that one bad step can bring an abrupt end. I watched Spirit of 76 do a dance last night when she tripped near her tent. While hanging my bear bag in the dark a few nights ago, I fell backwards and fortunately landed on soft ground. Better yet, nobody saw it to tease me.I thought I was ready for today as the day began but then realized I wasn't. I wanted that same leisurely pace as yesterday but such a pace is too slow for Subman and Suds. I opted to stay slow and hike by myself instead of attempting to keep up. I'm not writing this to imply anything other than I really wanted what I thought I wanted. With my firm belief that hiking the AT is the most selfish venture that I've ever done in my life, I chose to be absolutely selfish today. What's the saying - ""Wherever you go, you take yourself with you."" - I think it goes something like that. It wasn't how I pictured today playing out, but there it was. So after hiking a few minutes alone, I realized I didn't want that either. Wow, am I a mess or what. This should be a day of triumph and I was tying myself in knots uncertain how to get in a better place.So I listened to music and it picked me up. Thank you Kenny Loggins. If You Believe, Peace Of Mind, and a few others helped me get to a better place. As I worked over the tree roots I noticed that the trail must be taking me in a northeast direction because reflections coming from the sun's rays on Rainbow Lake were blinding at times. As I was getting out of this funk, my mind went to many places. I thought how blessed I am - with thanks going to each of my parents for raising and providing for me the way they did. I thought about my GrandDad - I wish he was alive so that I could see his happy, loving smile and hear him laugh one more time and hear him tell of the adventures of his life as he asked and commented about this one. I know Mark - blah, blah, blah - yup, emotions were raw and coming at me quickly.I stopped to take a picture near the north end of Rainbow Lake. Blues Brother came up from behind me. How often do we get second chances? Well, this was mine and I happily grabbed it. I thought Blues was long gone, but there he was. So we talked some more trail and about the coming end of this hike. Subman and Suds were still at Rainbow Ledges when Blues Brother and I arrived. Subman really loves sharing views of Mt. Katahdin and this view was spectacular. It was incredible to share this view with all of them. Blues and I each wanted a picture with each other. Blues is summiting Mt. Katahdin tomorrow while I intend to attempt it on Tuesday.Time to move on from Rainbow Ledges and they moved out quickly with what I suspect was adrenalin kicking in. I fell behind several times, but I wanted to be with them today at whatever pace was required. I knew that now. They probably aren't aware that I literally was jogging to fall in behind them only to fall behind again and have to jog once more. I thought about Fresh Ground and how he led Blues Brother, Who-Dat, and me into Damascus as a group saying we were going in together. I managed to hike out of the 100 Mile Wilderness with them. Why all the emotion today? It's coming to an end. Tomorrow's hike is just around 10 miles, hardly a full day's hike. Hiking Mt. Katahdin will be a survival test of sorts that is so unable to be predicted. Spirit of 76 and I stared at Mt. Katahdin from today's Abol Bridge campsite. Spirit was expressing concern about how steep and intimidating it appears. I pointed out how many have successfully hiked it and how we'll hike it too. Then I stepped to her other side and put my head down to display what the other side of me was thinking - essentially that this mountain was going to take us down and that we'll be lucky to get there and back alive. We laughed to overcome our real concerns. All this hiking has hopefully prepared us for this final test.Dinner was everything I could've asked for. It was the people, not the food. It was a mix of old and new. I was with Spirit. Spirit was with Arachne, who has hiked with Spirit so much more than I have. We were having dinner with Squirrel, Bald Whistler, and Cruise Director - who had been with us at White House Landing where we spent some, but not a lot, of time. I think it was a dinner we'll all look back on fondly as we took time to get to know each other when we easily could've spent such time differently. The AT brings people together - I think we all get that.First Aid is a southbounder who asked us for our trail names as we passed each other today. Suds, Blues Brother, and I stopped and spoke with him for a few minutes. Suds and Blues Brother headed out as the conversation came to an end. I lingered, I guess because I linger a lot. First Aid went out of his way to tell me that we were unusual in that we had stopped to speak with him. He said most northbounders tell them their names and then take off. I described what Spirit of 76 would be wearing (mint green) and told him that she'd stop to speak with him too. Over the course of the day, I heard Spirit and Arachne mention First Aid. I could tell that they had stopped and talked with him. Good people. So lucky to be with such good people.","Rainbow Stream Lean-To - Mile 2,159.0

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546469,"Today's trail was the easiest trail on the AT. Most of it was like walking in a park. There were some sections of trail that weren't park-like that felt like they were there to allow hikers to reminisce about this 2,189 mile trail and what hiking it was like. There were two forks in the Nesowadnehunk Stream that potentially had to be forded but Subman and I were able to rock-hop both of them while Suds chose to ford. As we got closer to the base of Mt. Katahdin, Katahdin Stream Campground, we met a number of people who were enjoying short hikes in this beautiful area. One family's children were so exuberant that I asked their ninja-turtle dressed son to give me some of his energy to help me hike Mt. Katahdin. He extended his hand and let me touch it to receive his transferred power. His little sister did a quick dance as I walked by. They were wonderful. If Katahdin could only be so easy.Subman, Suds, and I went to the ranger's station to register for our climb up Mt. Katahdin. Registration is a new requirement this year but doesn't cost anything. I am northbound hiker Number 391 this year. The ranger said there are about 80 or 90 more more northbound hikers this year than last. I mentioned that didn't seem to be that many more and then realized that the increase in percentage terms is substantial. My number was 90 on February 16th when hiking the Amicalola Falls approach trail to get to Springer Mountain to start this hike. I was Number 60 when I reached Harpers Ferry so a lot of hikers have passed me. Guess that's what happens when you don't hike in order to attend family events and recover from Lyme Disease.But I am here. Beth pulled into the parking lot just a few minutes after we hiked in. She's sporting a ""Rounce's Rides"" chauffeur's hat, courtesy of my clever sister-in-law Maggie. Beth brought watermelon and her delicious chocolate chip cookies, both perfect.Beth drove us to Millinocket where we will relax and prepare for Tuesday's climb up Mt. Katahdin. Monday's weather calls for rain that would negate summit views, but more importantly, make such this climb potentially dangerous. We anxiously awaited news of our friends who were summiting today. Blues Brother's summit picture was the first to arrive. He raced to the summit and got up and down in 5 hours. While up there, he saw Sunshine and Moonshine summit. Stripe was seen on the way up while Blues Brother was coming down. Plans for a celebratory dinner came together. Ten of us were there and we had a great time. Blues Brother told of his summit. Purples and her Dad, Blue, did too. Arachne was joined by her husband, Sam, who had driven 23 hours from Wisconsin to be here. Subman, Suds, Spirit of 76, Beth, and I all were there to hear of these climbs and share what it means to have hiked this trail. We tried to get Stripe here but our visit with him was delayed until tomorrow morning. We all came together just like we did many months ago. Back then we were individuals unified by our desire to hike this trail. Now, we are unified by this hike and the friendships that have been firmly forged along the way.We all talk of this trail in various ways. Tonight it felt like being at a local carnival where you periodically bump into neighbors and friends. You share the smiles that come with the rides or in tonight's case, photos or memories of meaningful moments on the trail. Some of us will stay to go on the carnival's best ride that has been saved for the end of the night, while some have already ridden it and are headed back home.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546503,"It rained hard this morning. Hope everyone hiking today hikes safely. The forecast has called for this rain for the last week and led to our decision to hike Mt. Katahdin tomorrow instead of today. So we get a rest day before hiking this challenging mountain. Stripe was with us this morning and told us about his summit yesterday when he summited with his sister and brother-in-law. He had a long day and said it was easily one of the hardest climbs experienced on the AT. Blues Brother hiked it quickly and said there was one mile of difficult hiking, but I get the impression from Stripe that hiking Mt. Katahdin will be a significant challenge. Being here at the base of Mt. Katahdin is a bit unreal. Except for the 33 mile section north of Mt. Washington that I intend to hike later this week, I hiked here from Georgia - GEORGIA! I really did it. Me - with so much help from so many people - with the good wishes and support from so many people, including you. I've recently realized that I didn't take much time to plan my hike for the New Hampshire and Maine sections of the AT. I now recall running out of time to do such planning in the weeks before this hike began. It's not because I thought I'd never get here, but instead thought I'd learn so much along the way and knew how planning that far in advance was foolhardy because the trail would jostle me around so much.   The AT certainly has smacked me a bit. But I'm here. There are less than 40 miles to hike. I'm asked about having to return to the White Mountains to hike the miles skipped in order to take the opportunity to hike to Katahdin with Subman and Suds. I am so happy that I made that decision. I've enjoyed hiking with them and realize, as I think about it now, that through them I've met some of their amazing friends. Surrounding yourself with great people leads to meeting other great people.The group gathered this morning to reminisce as we rested. Chairs kept on being added as our numbers swelled. Stripe and his sister, Janet. Beth and me. Spirit of 76. Forrest, Sherrie, and Mustard Seed arrived. Mustard Seed threw a coin at the window of the room occupied by Subman and Suds so that they'd join us. Slug arrived with Natalie. We laughed and talked. We're all here. I'm here with Beth. Beth will hike Katahdin with me tomorrow morning. It's more than I ever could've planned.","Katahdin Stream Campground - Mile 2,183.9

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546694,"It's 4:30 a.m. as I begin writing about yesterday's Mt. Katahdin summit hike. I am already dismissing the agony experienced during the hike so I want to write about it now. The summit hike was a beast. It was so much more difficult than I ever imagined it would be. I was humbled by it and said out loud more than once that I didn't belong on such a hike. This summit ""hike"" contained a challenging rock climbing section that was way beyond my comfort zone. I dreaded the thought of having to get down this same way after enduring this climb. I was very lucky to have Beth with me because she was a positive force all day long. I feel badly that she had to complete such a difficult hike in order to be with me at Mt. Katahdin's summit. My difficulty today probably wasn't shared by most who made the climb on this picture-perfect day. We saw many who nimbly climbed the section that troubled and exhausted me. My fear of falling got me good. I marveled at the children who passed me with sheer enjoyment. I feel very lucky that Beth and I are just tired and that we didn't get hurt. It took us a little more than 10 hours to complete the hike.  Beth drove Subman, Suds, Spirit of 76, and me to Katahdin Stream Campground, where we'd begin the summit hike. Cars were already ahead of us when we got there at 5:45. It took 45 minutes to get through the gate and drive the dirt road to park. It was wonderful to be in the car with these trail family who began to know each other back in Georgia on February 16th.  The hike began innocently enough with a flat, dirt-based section of trail. The gurgling sounds and sights of Katahdin Stream Falls were enthusiastic on the way up and comforting on the way down. The rocks on the trail became boulders as the trail became steeper. Stretching to climb became somewhat of the norm while we were below tree line. Beth and I laughed as a couple behind us came through a side route instead of climbing the boulders that required our struggle and contemplation of just how we were getting up and over them.Today's wind was significant and we were grateful that it seemed to always blow us into the mountain. Once above tree line, the trail required a bit of everything from us. There were stretches that initially exceeded the lengths we could stretch. We strained to find crevices or indentions in the boulders that would adequately accept a foothold or our fingers that quickly became scraped. There were places during the ascent that we could carefully stand and walk or shimmy to move up and forward. During the descent, these same sections found us butt-sliding and straining to find five points of contact instead of three. We were more than willing to shred our clothes on these boulders if that's what it took to safely descend. We gladly let faster hikers pass us and many more passed us on the way down than those who passed us on the way up. That one guy who hiked with us Mom amazingly remained upright both ways and attributed his ability to his strong sense of balance, while we realized that the strength of his core and entire body also contributed to his agility. We watched and followed hikers in order to find the best way to maneuver and advance. This hike was without a doubt my most mentally challenging hike of the AT.  Squirrel yelled to us as we finished the climbing section and began the final hike on the tableland section. The tableland section took longer to complete than we imagined it would and there was a bit of elevation at its end to reach the summit and that famous Katahdin sign. Cruise Director, first, and then Bald Whistler, a bit later, congratulated us and told us we were almost there as they passed us on their way down. The first cheer as we summited was from Spirit of 76 and then I heard Suds too. I saw them wave and cheer us on and Subman extended his hand of congratulations. There were so many more people at the summit than I ever expected to be, but my turn came to be photographed at the summit's sign. I will always cherish those moments and the sign photos with Spirit of 76, Subman, and Suds. I got a picture there with Beth too. I was glad that we noticed the huge cairn that Subman said was the location to place small stones carried from Springer Mountain. I gladly removed one of mine from my bear bag, where I stored them throughout this hike, and added it to the cairn. Doing this triggered my plan and I had Beth take a picture of me enjoying an Atomic Red Hot piece of candy that was purchased to specifically acknowledge Fresh Ground in this summit moment. I was glad that we were there to enjoy Arachne's summit celebration and congrstulate Forrest as he summited.The sun was out all day but the temperature and wind was such that we were never overwhelmed by heat. Jackets were required at the summit when our our bodies no longer were working and generating heat. It was too cold to eat lunch at the summit so we ate at the end of the tablelands, before beginning the challenging descent. We were glad to escape the wind when we finally hiked below tree line. The jackets were no longer required there and the coolness of the day was refreshing as today's hike wound down. The benefit of hiking slower than friends is that they are there to cheer you. And we received those cheers as this hike ended. We all spoke of how tired we were and showed this hike's battle scars in the forms of scraped or bloodied legs. I will never hike to Mt. Katahdin's summit again and am grateful that Beth's support, the support of my trail family, and my desire to complete an AT thru-hike enabled reaching Mt. Katahdin's summit today.","Katahdin Stream Campground - Mile 2,183.9

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546755,"It's a travel day for many of us who summited Mt. Katahdin. Some are remaining in Millinocket today and will begin their travels tomorrow. Beth and I picked up Spirit of 76 early this morning and drove her to Aunt Alice's hotel. Aunt Alice volunteered to give Spirit a ride to Bangor, Maine last night since she was going through it on her way home to Bar Harbor, Maine. Thanks Aunt Alice - I really appreciate you helping Spirit! Spirit will find her way home after she stops to see friends along the way.Beth dropped me off in Gorham, New Hampshire today so that I can begin hiking my 33 missing miles that were skipped in order for me to hike Maine with Subman & Suds. I didn't know back then that I'd also be hiking with Blues Brother, Spirit of 76, and other great folks. I feel great about that decision and will now hike these tough miles in the White Mountains.  Beth then continued her chauffeur services as she headed back to Connecticut with Subman and Suds in board. Beth will drop them off in Sherman, Connecticut where there car is waiting for them at a friend of Subman's sister. Subman and Suds will then visit family and take a side trip or two en route to going home in Georgia.  Speaking with hikers who summited Mt. Katahdin yesterday, it seems we all can use this day to let sore muscles get some rest. It seems like a zero day for many and life after the trail won't begin in earnest until we get home.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546889,"Summiting Mt. Katahdin a couple days ago was like being allowed to receive my diploma with my graduating class but knowing I had to turn in a homework assignment to make that diploma legal. So my hike today was starting to work on that missing homework that consists of this mileage patch between New Hampshire Route 2 and Mt. Washington.Today's start felt a bit like I was being penalized today. Beth and my trail family were gone. I was by myself and really felt like I was by myself when it took over an hour to get a hitch from Libby House to the Rattle River trailhead. Starting to hike erased all aspects of being penalized, it felt good to be out here. An upside to hiking today was having the opportunity to reflect on the Mt. Katahdin climb and to savor this whole hike, my trail family, and Beth. I also knew that I had some tough miles to hike today so I hiked with determination knowing, as Stripe says, ""The AT isn't going to hike itself.""I hiked alone for a few miles and then caught up to a southbounder - Brother Raccoon. He is a thoughtful young man for being just 23 years old. He said he sometimes didn't speak with people so I thought that was his polite way of telling me to shut up. But when I asked if I should shut up, he said no and that he felt he was learning something. That came as a shock because I'm still learning out here myself.I managed to hike to his pace for a while. We passed several northbounders and that was really weird because I am a northbounder doing this southbound homework assignment. Brother Raccoon and I introduced ourselves to the first few hikers we met. They were happy for me and congratulated me but it felt kind of weird so I stopped telling hikers about myself and let them think I was a southbounder like Brother Raccoon.That worked and made the introductions easier. And that was a bit of a change I noticed today too. Hikers in New Hampshire are sometimes introducing ourselves to each other. Some of these northbounders are still taking the time to meet new people and haven't yet been bitten with ""finish this hike fever"" that seems to result in not bothering to speak with any new hikers anymore.  So, Brother Raccoon and I hike along getting to know each other. It felt good and today's climbs came and went with little fanfare. I stopped to take pictures at certain spots and Brother Raccoon waited patiently. Then it got a bit strange.First part of strange was running into Flash 52. Flash was confused seeing me walk south so that took a few minutes of explanation in addition to catching up with him a bit since I last saw him many weeks ago. Then I was shocked when I came down to a couple guys Brother Raccoon was speaking with and one of them said my name. Chris and Nick are doing the 48 4,000 footers. Chris was finishing his 48th today while Nick was bagging his 44th. I think that's quite the achievement. Chris apparently has been reading my trailjournal posts and thought he might run into me today. To say I was honored is a big understatement. Chris sounds like he would love to hike the AT someday and I left him thinking that anyone that hikes all 48 4,000 footers sure seems like someone who does what they set out to do, so my bet is that I'll be reading Chris's trailjournal someday.We soon met a hiking family of four who were out bagging some 4,000 footers of their own. The elementary school-aged daughter proudly told me that she too bad just 4 more 4,000 footers to go. I lingered a bit too long talking with this family and lost Brother Raccoon at this point. I was about to begin climbing North Carter Mountain.  My notes about North Carter Mountain are scary. Gangsta called this descent ""totally insane"" and Lucky said he ""almost bought it here."" Since I was going southbound, I was climbing it instead of descending it. As I climbed, I realized how difficult this descent would be. It was a tough climb that I can't imagine descending. Lunch at the top of North Carter Mountain was a real treat as I could see for many miles below and the view gave me plenty of mountains to see.  I was monitoring how many miles were ahead to be hiked today and got comfortable that I would get to Carter Notch Hut before dinner was being served. This awareness let me hike and enjoy the last 7 miles of today's hike. It started to rain lightly and I thought this good day was going to be ruined but the rain stopped and I really wasn't very wet. The final descent down to Carter Notch Hut was steep. I fell once and stared at the rock that did me in. Yup, I bet I'd fall again if I stepped on it a second time. Guess I was daydreaming a bit and not paying enough attention. I had landed very softly and found myself somewhat amused by the fall instead of being concerned and having to check for aches and pains.  There aren't many people here at Carter Notch Hut. The Croo here was able to spend more time talking with us and one member are with us which was nice. I had seconds on everything and it was food I'd never tried before. I was reminded of Beth's dad saying that he hoped I wouldn't eat everything in sight once this hike ends. Having to curb our eating habits was a topic of conversation yesterday in the car with Subman and Suds. Must admit that I miss them already.So Day 1 of this missing homework assignment is over. I still have another 19.4 miles to finish but it sure feels close to being done now. Slug said he was a bit envious of me having this hike to do after Katahdin. Today was different but it felt good and I'm pretty happy as this day comes to an end.","Gorham, New Hampshire

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546956,"A light sprinkle began literally minutes after I began hiking this morning. Today's hike had lots of ups and downs. The rain wasn't a problem when I was climbing but the rocks were really slippery on the descents. The descents made me think of Suds throughout this hike. Suds and I hiked a lot together on countless descents these last few weeks. We take them slow. We often hold on to trees to control our speed as we figure out where we'll place our feet. All morning long, every time I grabbed a tree resulted in a fresh shower of raindrops falling all over me and my feet. It made for a lot of smiles.Thinking of Suds naturally made me think of Subman. Subman was my beacon throughout this hike. His experience and confidence as we hiked provided immense value from the beginning to the end. His leadership inspired me. He often said ""hike your own hike"" and I feel I embraced that relatively early when I decided to leave Gatlinburg, Tennessee even though they were staying to take a zero day there. I felt so supported and welcomed by Subman and Suds to rejoin them in Gorham, New Hampshire. Reuniting with Subman and Suds was such a joy as we hiked through Maine together. I realized early today that I was remembering so many of those who I had hiked with. Spirit of 76. The memories poured in. When at the summit of Wildcat Mountain A, I turned my phone on and had access. A message came from Spirit that reinforced the memories I'd already recalled. It's not that we hiked hundreds of miles together. It was the impact she had on my hike - from the beginning and in the end. Those good vibes that took root when we walked to see a blue-blaze waterfall were important building blocks for my hike. Spirit embodied the beauty of the AT. Her trail name fits her perfectly. Blues Brother, who hiked more miles with me than anyone else, was present in my thoughts too. It was all I could do not to stop and call him today. Roy, the fictitious creator of the trail and all the mischievous twists and turns before us, was really at it today. There were virtually no white blazes while hiking the Wildcat mountains. How many times did Blues say he was going to write a letter and enclosing some money with the recommendation that a white can of paint be purchased. The absence of white blazes was such that I asked a hiker passing the other way whether I was still in the AT. He quickly responded with a forceful ""I hope so. I haven't seen a blaze in miles."" We laughed and I knew Blues and I had another hiker who would be happy to affix his name to Blues' letter. Later, when hiking the fiendish steep descent to Pinkham Notch, it seemed that I came to virtually the same open ledge view spot multiple times. I remember the day Blues Brother and I told each other how we separately felt that aliens were playing games with us and periodically beaming us up and dropping us so that we had to hike the same section a second or third time. We hadn't lost our minds or believe in aliens but the sense that we'd hiked similar trail made for some funny moments as we hiked.What memories. What people. Rambo - with his kilt and him being the best rock hopper I saw out here, Fresh Ground - a truly inspirational friend who will forever be my Forrest Gump because of his effortless ability to say meaningful sayings again and again and again - ""last climb of the day"" being said at 7:00 a.m. - how many hikers who knew and loved him and how we enjoyed and joked about his fame on the trail, Bubbles & Sprout - two of the sweetest people I'll ever know and love for their genuine love of each other and their embrace meant of me, Mountain Man & Karma - my Swiss adventurer's with stories from India and plans to go to Australia after the AT, Candlemaker - how we ran into each other several times with him saying ""It can't be."" when it happened again - I so wished it had happened one more time - as Fresh Ground said ""Fly my friend, Fly!"", Swamp Angel & Captain Kirk - Wow! How I so enjoyed talking with them as we passed each other, Papa Wolf and Halmi - who dreamed that we'd finish the AT together and how Halmi made shelter fires night after night - including the one when I roasted my wet socks over the fire, Who-Dat - as strong a man mentally as he was physically and that's saying a lot, Booty - who popped up so often that we became friends and was the hiker who I had to turn around on when I felt so badly and later learned I had Lyme disease, Teach & Steady - who I met that first day and how Spirit of 76 teased me for letting them summit before us, Jennifer & Jeff - our friends from Washington, Two Peas - we met in Hiawassee at dinner when I had my broken finger and how Moonbeam's hike ended with a broken femur. There was Slug - such a strong hiker and always having an interest in others - I so appreciated the attention he gave others as he listened to them and how he embraced Beth as one of ""us"", Patches - my ""shooting star"" that I would spend just a fleeting moment with but loved that moment so much. I replayed the laughter Fresh Ground and Blues Brother had as I couldn't understand who, according to Fresh Ground, this speedy phenom named ""Medic"" was while I spoke highly of Morgan, the first person I met on the Amilacola Approach Trail. They let it go for a few days before revealing and laughing that Medic and Morgan were the same person. Big Critter came to mind as we watched the NCAA b-ball championship with Fresh Ground.I realized at some point that I was playing back early memories and that quickly made me aware of the most recent ones. Stripe - how I wish we'd have met hundreds of miles earlier. He is, without a doubt, the most positive person I met out here. He was a joy to hike with - every time. Arachne - she came into view with Spirit of 76. She told it like it was and I could tell right away that she and Spirit had a blast, but that she'd always talk straight, a trait I value and respect. At the very end came Squrrel, Bald Whistler & Cruise Director, Forrest, and Hooshr. I'm happy we made time for each other and invested in each other when it would've been easy to succumb to the ""finish fever"" that seems to have spread to many out here. Brother Raccoon - meeting him just a couple days before this hike will end was an eye-opener. There are so many great people out here to meet and get to know. How can we be open to meet them and how can we be open to others long after we leave this trail. Brother Raccoon and I talked about this and I was happy to be able to say goodbye and good luck to him at Pinkham Notch after today's hike ended.Today's hike went on and on. It didn't seem to end. As I passed the Wildcat gondola, I wanted to ask why such a ride down like this isn't available at Mt. Katahdin's summit. I would've paid big bucks for such a ride down from there. And that me return to thinking about Spirit and how Beth, Spirit, and I talked about how much money or something of value would be needed to get us to hike Katahdin again. So the memories kept coming. I wish my mind could be good enough to remember them all as they came. Maybe I'll remember some of them tomorrow. Now there's less than 14 miles to hike. Today's hike was a hard one. I fell late and it wasn't a controlled fall. Fortunately, I wasn't hurt. So close and yet so far.","Carter Notch Hut - Mile 1,875.6

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547106,"The alarm woke me up at 4:15 a.m.. This was it but would I be able to hike the final 13.5 miles to Mt. Washington's summit early enough in order for Beth to greet me there and drive us down the mountain road before it closes - and even more importantly, drive us home to stay. I knew I should be able to do it, but Suds and I often said how we had lost confidence in the trail in the sense that you didn't know what was confronting us around the next turn. Tom, Debbie, Doug & Eileen - get ready. I'm coming home. I say this because here comes an analogy or two - and they often ridicule me for them when they make sense only to me. Guess my mind is transitioning to life after the trail because the analogies came early today. Beth asked me if she thought I'd be filled with memories like I was yesterday. I told her I envisioned me being Dorothy from the Wizard Of Oz, only that I'd be hiking feverishly instead of Dorothy riding that bike.I started hiking in the dark. Headlamp was on, just like a time or two with Subman and Suds. The trail was easy to follow initially and I was happy to see that I'd gone more than 2 miles as the day's light surrounded me. I passed a trail junction and made the needed turn. Less that 15 minutes later after descending terrain I didn't want to repeat by climbing back, I wondered if I'd made the correct turn. Subman - where are you, I need you now. I kept hiking as fast as I could since I was committed to this direction and this path. Not a single white blaze. It didn't feel good. A stream came - a pretty stream. I took a photo of it and hoped it was the stream as should exist according to the AWOL Guide. A little while later, a northbound hiker named Cheeks came and I asked her what trail we were on. ""The AT - and yeah, I haven't seen a blaze in a while."" Those words were sweet to hear. Better yet was the Suspension Bridge before me. Took a picture of that too. I was navigating the trail correctly. By now, I was thinking seriously about today's hike and would I be successful. I thought about the Ali-Frazier fights. I won the first bout with Mt. Washington's summit when I successfully hiked there that began as a long day below Webster Cliffs. I was knocked out early in the second bout when I turned around after starting to hike north from the summit. I stopped that hike minutes after it began because I couldn't see the trail due to walking in a cloud; my glasses were so covered in moisture that they were more a hindrance than a help - and I can't see very well without them. Today was the rematch - Ali won it and I badly wanted to win it too. I wanted this day to be a joyful end and I didn't want Beth to worry if I failed to show up. The climbs were significant but I periodically pushed myself to hike faster, trying to increase the likelihood of me being successful today. The trail provided a view. I mean I had a VIEW! Was that really it on my left? Yup, Mt. Washington's summit was visible, incredibly there with just a small cloud in the sky. After losing that second bout, I just wanted to be able to see the trail today. I wanted a chance to be successful today and it looked like I was getting it.  A hiker by the name of Old Timer passed me and said I was going to have a great summit today because the weather was clear. Wild Bill, Peanut, and Red & Crash all asked about my hike as we passed each other. They were absolutely thrilled to hear that I'd be finishing today at Mt. Washington's summit. They were so happy for me and I briefly told them about Maine's coming beauty that soon would be their experience. And then I hiked above the tree line and saw clear blue skies - everywhere. Subman called it an ""11"" on a scale of 1 - 10, to describe the perfect weather we had at Clingmans Dome. It seemed that I was getting a similar day today, my last day on the trail. What a gift! The trail became filled with boulders on the climb up Mt. Madison. I was taking photos and taking in the views. I checked my time and had access so I sent Beth a message saying I might reach the summit early and that I could clearly see the summit. I was feeling like a winner - for today and this whole hike. Climbing the boulders slowed me down. I reached the summit of Mt. Madison. Nope, it was a false summit and I was then able to see the real summit above me. Nope, after I got there I saw more false summits ahead of me along with the summit that really was the Mt. Madison's summit. It requires more climbing than I expected. By the time I got there, I was behind my desired timeline for today's hike. If this time span was needed for the next 6 miles then I would not make it in time. I stil had access and sent Beth another message saying our original time was to be expected (I hoped. I didn't tell her about my concern.)The sun had all the boulders bone dry and made for good traction. Mark's post yesterday said ""No more falls!"" and yet I knew my desired 3 points of contact would take too much time so I tried the rock hopping that most good hikers use. Stay high and move from one rock to another. Give up the practice of anchoring a pole before moving a foot to another boulder. It wasn't easy for me because I feared falling on the jagged rocks, but I did it anyway and for the most part got away with it. Occasionally there was the just-in-time planting of a pole to steady myself. That one pole placement that had the pole go deeply into a crevice was momentarily hair-raising as I was headed down until the pole finally found a stopping point and stopped my impending fall. I was determined to win today's bout. The trail consisted of boulders but they were uncharacteristically flat and smooth. I could actually hike with full strides. I made up the time and then some. I was relieved. And I then relaxed. The trail wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I was already passed Mt. Madison. The climbs ahead were less than the climbs behind me. Hikers who slowed to speak with me were extending their hands to congratulate me. Finishing was still ahead of me but it was increasingly in my reach. While monitoring my pace, I decided to enjoy this the rest of the way. There were only 5 miles left. Time to take in the views that were made available by today's sunny weather. My pace was fine and I no longer needed to take any chances as I hiked. I realized I just couldn't stop to enjoy this. But I could stop and take photos whenever I wanted. I took photos close to each of the the last 5 miles of my hike. Mt. Washington's summit and the end of my AT hike were coming closer and closer. I thought of the remaining time to hike today. It all felt so good. And it was such a gift. Had the weather been as it normally is, it would've been a very different day. But this was my hike's ending day. It wasn't of my choosing. It was like the trail that has to be dealt with, whatever it is. I was lucky and knew it. A passer by said he'd come from the summit and that someone told him they get a day like this once or twice a year. A clear view, sunny but not hot, wind that was less than 10 miles per hour. I took a few hours to finish. I suspect I could be accused of lingering a bit. I noticed the cliff-like fall opportunity a mile from the summit and shuttered to think what could've happened if I had tried to hike through the horrible weather when I lost the second fight and turned around, feeling very disappointed but feeling like I really had no choice that day.My head popped up and over a boulder and I saw Beth there, perking up to see me. There was a tear in my eye. She told me to pause for a photo before I got my hug. We finished and stood in line to get a few pictures at the Mt. Washington summit sign. I warned everyone in line that I wanted a picture of us kissing. And then I asked the photographer if he couldn't take another photo after the first one. I almost felt giddy. Beth was smiling. I'd be heading home tonight - to stay. Spirit of 76 and I exchanged a message as she thought I'd be finishing my homework assignment today. We took pictures from the summit and were walking to get a little food when Brother Raccoon called out congratulations to me. It was a nice surprise and we wished each other well as we grabbed a quick picture together.  I was tired on the way home. I normally am active and uploading photos or writing my journal as Beth drives. Not this drive. I fell asleep, woke up briefly, and fell asleep again. Beth did what she's done this whole time - she kept me going and getting me to where I next needed to be.Tonight's destination was home. Where I now need to be. Such a gift. I am so happy.","Pinkham Notch - NH 16 - Mile 1,869.7

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547111,"I woke up in my home this morning. It felt great. A couple days ago, while hiking, I found myself thinking about my trail family and many others who I was so fortunate to have spent time with along this incredible journey.  Many of you reading this from the beginning know that I almost never started hiking. As Beth and I cried before she drove home, I really was ready to back into Hiker Hostel, get my stuff, and join her for the ride back. I knew then that I wasn't emotionally prepared to leave her then.Looking back, it's hard to imagine that I really didn't see her for more than a month at the beginning of this hike. I guess it was a period of hiking immersion. What I know and suspect you know too is that I could not possibly have completed this hike without her overwhelming support.Support is such a woefully inadequate word to describe what she provided. I got her love the way she gives it with smiles, laughter, kidding, and ribbing. ""Come on Bubba!"" Can't begin to recall when she began saying that. We had fun when she visited. She met my hiking friends. I had already separated from Subman, Suds, and Spirit by the time she arrived for her first visit, but she met Blues Brother and Fresh Ground there. They were already known to her from my journal posts and our phone calls. She quickly met Candlemaker and Booty there, even I didn't know that I'd hike with them in many of the upcoming states. The Good Friday meal at Woodchuck's is a memory I hope to remember every year from now on.  Beth and I rode bikes on the Creeper Trail and she dangled her feet over McAfee Knob. Those were times of sheer fun. We had other visits, like the one at Delaware Water Gap, where I needed so much time to prepare for my next few days of hiking that all I could do was introduce Beth to those I was hiking with at the time. But I'm so glad that we took the time there for her to meet Bubbles & Sprout, Mountain Man & Karma, and she got to see CandleMaker there too. Then there were multiple visits with Rambo that allowed the two of them to get to know each other. If you saw then or are realizing now how involved and important a part Beth was for this hike, then you're understanding it correctly. And that all took place before I got Lyme Disease and how she facilitated my recovery and kept this thru-hike alive by hiking with me or being with me while I solo-hiked longer sections between trailhead parking lots. Looking back, I could not have kept hiking without her. My hike would've ended. I know I wouldn't have wanted to continually hike solo north of Connecticut. But I didn't have to hike solo because she was always ready to do whatever it took to keep this adventure alive.  Beth brought the fun back into the AT for me. As the fun returned, my hiking strength began to return. My strength never returned completely. I was a much weaker hiker after Lyme Disease, but my physical stamina and ability was good enough and leaning on her, my emotional strength and enthusiasm came back.Then came our family vacation. A time we cherish with our family and loved ones. With it came the big decision about how to resume hiking post-vacation. Beth was the one who challenged me to resume hiking with Subman and Suds and accept that I'd temporarily skip some miles in the Whites in order to hike north of New Hampshire's Route 2 (essentially all of Maine). To say that I initially hated that idea, and the thought of it, is a gross understatement. I realized it was the right thing to do though. In the end, it was a pivotal decision and a great one for me. Not only did I hike with Subman and Suds but Blues Brother shocked me by turning up along the way and Spirit of 76 was there too. I wouldn't have gotten out there without her. She didn't complain about switching roles from hiking to not hiking. She added up the miles she hiked with me and said they total more than 200. That's a lot of hiking and then she hiked the very difficult Mt. Katahdin hike too.  So the hike has ended. But my journey with Beth will go on, hopefully for decades to come. I can't imagine ever finding a way to return her love and encouragement. But I assure you that I will try.",,Home,"Aug 28, Sun",0
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547268,"The response to my trailjournal posts as I shared each day's AT hike has been the biggest surprise of my experience. So many of you sent me words of encouragement throughout the hike, when I struggled with Lyme Disease, and when I returned to the trail. Some of you were with me from the beginning and wrote with a frequency that makes me feel like I know you through your posts. Mark & Aunt Alice wrote so frequently with thoughtful, funny, or such interesting reads that my friends from home are virtually demanding that they get a chance to meet them in person. Mark and Fresh Ground occasionally roughed me up in such funny and humorous ways that those comments took on a life all of their own - those posts often brought vivid memories of our shared past. Some of you read my posts to find out about others - Fresh Ground and Spirit of 76 were of most interest. Stripe's sister, Janet, told me not to weigh down her brother's backpack with rocks - pointing out that there were repercussions if I telegraphed what I was up to, even if it was being done in the name of good natured humor. I was touched by comments from AT hikers who encouraged me or said my writing reminded them of their hiking the AT. And I was absolutely blown away when I met someone who said they were reading my journal. Many of those I hiked with are shown in today's photos in case you wonder what these great characters look like.I wrote such long entries to remind me of the many activities and thoughts that were experienced on this journey. Thanks for bearing with me when I went on too long and when I wrote of off-trail memories. I was surprised by the variety and volume of memories that filled my days. I wrote them down so that Anne and David could become aware of them.I learned so much by reading trailjournals over the last several years. I felt I had a responsibility to write about my hike and hoped to provide something of potential value to future hikers.I was sometimes tired when I wrote so thanks for putting up with all kinds of ramblings. Beth spotted many mistakes, especially my phone's entry of word suggestions that managed to get through, so thanks for putting up with that too.Andy and Mark commented the most about how each day's title consisted of songs on my IPod playlists. I had such a good time hiking and thinking about a song that captured the essence or a particularly special part of that day. Harry Chapin will forever be one of my favorites. Today's song title is Short Stories, one of Harry's songs, and that's what I tried to write each day. Thank you for reading and encouraging me to share my thoughts and photos. My heart was so touched by Steve from Bennington, Vermont who told me how he shared my photos with his young granddaughter and how she waved her hand to ask him to show her more.Today's picture contains one of ten medallions that I carried from my start in Springer, Georgia all the way to Mt. Katahdin in Maine. I carried some stones too. I carried them with the intent to give them to my children and to their children and loved ones. I hope they will remind them of my love for them and that I wish them joy in life.This journal is dedicated to my GrandDad. I loved him when he lived and miss him now. I wish we could talk about this adventure just as we talked about his adventures. My Mom and her sisters created ""My Life And Times - Memoirs Of Russell W. MacDonald"" which is a collection of his letters to Aunt Alice or letters written to all of them to share memories. I found a memory I wrote about him and am repeating it here so that I'll have it years from now - thanks for again being patient with me. It didn't matter what the story was. It never did. All of us fortunate enough to be sitting around the dining room table or sharing such a moment somewhere else were lucky. However it began, we all knew what was coming. Grandma would remember it differently. GrandDad deferred, to let Grandma take over telling the tale. A special memory of mine remembers GrandDad raising his hand to establish that he'd like to say a word before the conversation moved on. Often there would be banter back and forth about a specific detail. But it wasn't over until Grandma had her say, followed by GrandDad's version, and occasionally with one final quip from Grandma - often said softly - but heard nonetheless. Whether it finished with Grandma's slight smile or with that signature smile GrandDad had - that's my favorite memory. Sharing the moments of their lives, in a flow full of their love and respect for each other. A real blessing.I've thoroughly enjoyed sharing my adventure with you. Thanks for being a huge part of it.",,House,"Aug 29, Mon",0
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547305,"I don't know who introduced trailjournals.com to me but know that I was pulled into the AT as I read and read and read. Beth couldn't understand how I spent so much time reading trailjournals over the last several years. But then Beth became hooked and began reading many trailjournal writers' entries this year and she ""gets it"" now. A final thanks to my daughter, Anne, who posted many journals on short notice. If not for her, I doubt that I could've kept journaling each day.  What I saw in the trailjournal entries read before this year's hike and what was this year's experience is that the AT provides a blank canvas for each of its hikers. What each hiker does with it is entirely of their own choosing. And hikers make countless decisions as we pursue this trail - decisions about who we do or don't spend time with as we hike or rest, decisions about whether we rest in shelters or tent at commonly-shared locations or stealth sites, decisions about how much we share with each other about what we are thinking or feeling, decisions about the pace that we intend to or actually hike.  There are so many unique hikers out here. They add so much as we move through this challenging and beautiful trail. Then there are the stationary people, who anchor specific locations as they provide nourishment or shelter in their own ways and preferences. The Doyle in Duncannin, PA is a must stop on the AT with Vicky being my favorite and Greasy Creek Friendly's Connie being the most unique - go ahead Blues Brother and Fresh Ground, sing her song. If you want to spoil yourself then get to Cantarosso Farm in Erwin, Tennessee or White House Landing in Maine's 100 Mile Wilderness. I could go on and on because there are so many memories of these wonderful characters and places.  This trail enables each hiker to ""hike your own hike."" It's amazed me to see this play out this year. It amazed me to see how very different hikers came together to thoroughly enjoy each other and form trail families or move along to hike on their own or find company more to their liking.  If I were granted one AT wish or mulligan, I'd use mine to remain more open to others throughout the journey. I realized too late that I shut myself off from other hikers by tenting instead of sleeping in shelters and by staying in hotels instead of hostels or by not stopping to talk longer as we passed. I was so much more comfortable in my tent or hotel or was in too much of a hurry. But I'm positive that this comfort or pace came at the expense of not meeting more hikers - hikers who would have energized and fueled me. I was fascinated by so many I spoke with - whether they were hiking for that day, a few days, a few months this year after having hiked some before or intending to hike more in the future, or those who pursued hiking it all in one year in one continuous direction or split into sections. Appreciating and respecting each other is so important and leads to beauty that rivals what is seen over this trail's many miles. As I now am in my comfortable home, I realize that this AT wish extends to life beyond the trail and that my challenge will be to find ways to be more open here too.  Subman reminded me during the last two weeks that I told him I wasn't a hiker when we originally met. I am still learning and am not sure I am a hiker yet. But I hiked the AT! Trust me when I say that if I can do it. You can do it too. All the best to you and your loved ones. Happy Hiking!",,Home,"Aug 30, Tue",0
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548242,"It's been two weeks since my hike ended. Mark recently asked how I am doing now that I am back to life ""like the rest of us"". I have and have had a pretty good life. It's easy to ""adjust"" to having a refrigerator, toilet, shower, and bed. I am back to watching lots of television too. It's been great to catch up and speak with friends and family. I particularly like emphasizing that I am home for good - my hike is completed. When Beth and I were first married, she would follow me around the day before I headed out of town to work for days or a week. I was reminded of this as I found myself smothering her a bit during my first days home. I received a scolding after I failed to let her know where I was going one day when I returned unused hiking purchases. I thought it was a bit funny, but she wasn't amused. It was a reminder that I have been gone a long time with just my hiking family really aware of where I am and where I'll be. So I am adjusting. Week 1 saw frequent refrigerator raids at all hours of the night - fudgsicles continue to be consumed. Physically, my feet still don't feel normal. Pads grew on the bottom of my feet, something like an animal's paws. I really don't understand the difficulty I have walking down a flight of stairs. It makes me wonder how I managed to hike a couple weeks ago.I don't miss the hiking. I am so glad that I hiked the AT, but I continue to be glad that the hike was completed. I am so grateful to Beth and realize even more how I never would've finished without her pushing me in a loving way to get back out there. I also realize that I couldn't have finished without my incredible trail family and the trail friends that made my final weeks so enjoyable. I periodically am in contact with them. It's not the same as when we are hiking, but it's pretty good. I feel as close to them as I feel with my best friends from high school, college, and those incredible first years of growth after college and our initial years of marriage. I feel comfortable saying that I'm certain I'll be able to see them years from now and be able to pick up with them as if we've never been apart. We went through this together and it connected us in a significant, binding way.I miss meeting new, amazing people. I miss the adventure and sense of accomplishment that came with each day's hike. I've reread my February entries and am taken right back to experience it again. I became increasingly aware, as I recovered from Lyme Disease, or just how important people were to me and are to me. My journey taught me how much I treasure people. As much as I enjoyed hiking for miles by myself - miles that let me recall so many great memories of my life and think about my loved ones and all of your overwhelming support - I realize that I was dependent on interacting with all of you. The mental part of hiking the AT was so much harder than the physical part. I'd been forewarned about the tremendous mental challenge and know, for me, that it was all that and more. My recollection is that Big Guy, my incredible father-in-law, found it amazing that I began this hike not having anyone to hike with each day when this hike began. Looking back, it is amazing to me that I began this hike by myself. The February posts embrace hikers that quickly became my trail family. This will probably be confusing but, now that I've hiked the AT, I can't see me hiking an extended time without incredible people around me. I think I hiked with some who can hike by themselves, but know that's not me.Today's picture shows where I'm at with this hike's facial growth. It's not the same as when I finished the hike, but it's a big difference from when I began this hike. I don't know how long this look will remain. In some ways it's a continual reminder of my hike. I miss my ongoing banter with Mark and Aunt Alice. I miss getting needled by my sister Janet and Fresh Ground. It will be interesting to think of all of this as time passes. I look for your e-mails almost everyday and have a genuine sense of excitement when a post comes my way. How I'll ever replace all of this eludes me. I just read my list of reasons to hike the AT. Included in them were to enjoy and embrace the comraderie of the AT hiking community, to have a larger-than-life experience, and to look forward to engaging with new friends in the coming years. My transition is underway. I am already grateful for the memories. Thanks to all of you.",,Home,"Sep 10, Sat",0
Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554569,"Fresh Ground started hiking today. It's been almost one year since I started my hike. So many great memories - so many great people. I was so lucky. Sounds like Booty will be starting soon too andBlues Brother will either be out there or be working at a hostel. In about a month, Subman & Suds will marry at Springer Mountain and Stripe says he's planning on being there. I'm sure Trail Chef and Judi will be there too. It will be a great chance to see all of them so that's a trip I intend to make. I'm hoping to find some of these hikers along the way.I'm hoping that Swamp Angel and Captain Kirk will send me this year's hiking plan. Jennifer & Jeff will be resuming their section hike too. I've just read in trailjournals that Signage and Holcomb are returning to the trail. Sounds like I have the chance to do some trail magic and share a few moments - can't wait.Plans are underway for a trek in a couple months. More on that later.

Rabbit ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560454,"Reunions are so special. Subman & Suds were married on a beautiful day in March at Springer Mountain, the AT's starting point. Attending the ceremony were their children, friends, and some of their extensive trail family. Stripe, Forrest, and I represented the 2016 contingent. Trail Chef was there too. It was great seeing everyone.On my way to Springer, I caught up with Fresh Ground in Elk Garden (Virginia) and with Blues Brother and Booty in Franklin (North Carolina). They all looked great. I haven't been in contact with Booty and Blues Brother since then but saw Fresh Ground again in Glasgow (Virginia) on a separate trip. Fresh Ground just passed the 1000 mile marker and intends to hike to Katahdin this year. Booty intends to get there too and his timetable is such that he just might catch Fresh Ground before then. Maybe I'll be able to see them again in Connecticut or Massachusetts.Time spent with these friends was so enjoyable and the memories of last year's hike came back so quickly. It was great seeing everyone.Today starts a new adventure. I am joining David (my son) and several of his colleagues and friends on a trip to Nepal. We'll follow the Everest Base Camp route for most of trip before veering off to go to Imja Lake, a glacial lake on which his research has found him here several times before.Thanks to everyone who I hiked with last year and to everyone who signed in my journal. I've been reading my journal entries from last year and continue to be stunned by that experience. I'm hoping to start another one now. All the best! Enjoy!",,Nepal,"Apr 17, Mon",0
