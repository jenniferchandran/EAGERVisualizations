Eight-Thirty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523199,Well I just set up this journal and now I want to see if it works. I uploaded a photo and it was sideways. If it turns out that way I'll have to change it. I wasn't going to do a trail journal and then I reflected on how important reading the journals had been in my decision to attempt a thru-hike. So maybe my entries can help someone else along the trail. If this all works I will do an introduction entry next.,,Test page,"Mar 11, Fri",0
Eight-Thirty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523373,"Having waited in vain to see my journal on line, I read the material again and see that I have to make three entries before it starts being posted. I tried, also in vain, to fix my photo, it still is sideways. The picture is of me standing in front of Fontana Dam during my 2014 thru hike of the Benton MacKaye trail. My thing with the AT began in 1964, when I first backpacked during summer camp. After a youth filled with backpacking and camping trips, I went off to college and lived my life, only returning to the mountains and the trail occasionally. Then in 2013 the bug hit again and I resolved to take up backpacking in retirement. Much has changed, wow, 30 pound packs! So I set about to learn it all over and along the way I found Trail Journals. And my old friends the Troverts, who thru hiked in 2012. What a great journal. I planned to attempt a thru hike in 2014 but life stopped me. Again in 2015 my plans were interrupted, but along the way I discovered flip flopping. So now it is a few days over one month before my flip flop thru hike begins. I'll attend the kick off at Harpers Ferry, WV on April 16, and then head north on the 17th.","Test page

Eight-Thirty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523376,"My first shake down hike occurred in November, 2013. I hiked from Dicks Creek Gap in Georgia, south to the Amicalola Falls State Park. About 80 miles. I took this hike with the Georgia Sierra Club. It was a great trip, everything you want from the AT, hard days, cold nights, rain and storms. My pack was heavy and I had moments of doubt. I finished the hike and got my trail name - Eight-thirty. The next summer I went out alone on the Benton MacKaye trail, the southern alternative. It took me 28 days to walk the 300 miles of this trail. It was also hard and lonely. Twice I went for three days without seeing another person. Having completed that one I determined to walk from Fontana south to Dicks Creek Gap. Another November hike that turned really cold. Too cold for me and I ended early at the NOC. Lessons were learned. Last May I went out into the Great Smokey Mountains NP for four days, walking 44 miles. I climbed Shuckstack, went back down, climbed Gregory Bald over to Russell Field, back down, and climbed Spence Field and back down into NC. The same week I was there, the hiker from Ohio was attacked in his hammock by a bear. More lessons learned. In all, I've now hiked about 500 miles in preparation for my AT thru hike.","Introduction

This week I began purchasing food for the trail, wow. I have a plan for my hike. It starts out very detailed, moves to a less detailed format and so on. I am dividing the trail into four parts, Harpers Ferry to Kent, CT, Kent to Mount K, HF to Damascus, and Damascus to Springer. For part 1, I have looked hard at shelters, miles, trail towns etc. The only thing I am making myself do at this point in the plan is to commit to 10 mile days for the first week. Virtually all AT advice columns say do this. I plan on buying most of my food along the way. Perhaps my wife will be sending me some food from time to time. At this time I'll have new shoes sent from home. Perhaps a new trail shirt when I do the flip. My gear is virtually complete, I'm working on getting it in this journal. It looks like my base weight will be 20.5 lbs. Not as light as I would have liked, but that includes a bear canister. My wife (Nature Girl) and I will drive from our home in Macon, GA to Harpers Ferry, leaving on April 14. We will attend the ATC Flip Flop Kick Off on April 16 and I will start the hike on April 17.","

Man, what a rush! This is really happening. My bag is pretty much finished, my base weight is right at 22 pounds, that includes my empty water containers, empty bear canister, and a mostly empty fuel canister. Fully loaded I will be around 30 pounds, heavier then I wanted but not undoable. As the weather warms I have a few cool weather items I can send home, and I'm still holding on to an extra pair of socks ""just in case."" Last night I worked on my food some, I'm leaving with three days worth, my wife will bring me three more days before she goes home, and I'm going to send myself two mail drops just to get started. After that I'll buy as I go, with some things mailed along the way. Over the last couple of weeks I reread David Miller's AWOL on the Appalachian Trail and past s of Zach Davis's Appalachian Trials. When I met David Miller at the Georgia AT kick-off I told him his book was a big influence on my decision to try a thru-hike, he replied that I couldn't blame him!

We passed through the battlefield of South Mountain throughout the day. At one gap I read the story of a Georgia unit, the wire grass Georgians that took 50% casualties during the fight. Half our group stopped at the Dalgrehn campground but I pressed on to the shelter. It was a hot afternoon and we walked in the sun as the leaves have yet to come out here.

The trail alternated between pleasant walking and rock fields. At one point I lost the trail in the rocks. I was proud of myself when I reached the shelter, 13.2 miles. Peter Wolf and his dog were the only ones at the shelter. I took the long trail to the spring for water.

Folks wanted me to stay in the shelter as rain was threatening. I chose to tent and thought my set up was good. Not so, I slid down the slope and my feet stuck out of the tent and got wet. Also a small pool formed in the end of the tent. So I got up in the middle of he night and fixed everything and went back to bed. No foul. But tent must be level if it's going to rain.

At Pine Grove Furnace we ate at the famous grill. I had a Philly steak sandwich and fries. Greasy goodness. Also an ice cream sandwich. Boomer, Jeb and our friend Phil camped here in 1988, I think, while attending the 125th anniversary of Gettysburg. At the precise moment, 125 years later we stepped off and crossed the fields where Picketts men found death and glory. While eating I dried out my tent so it was back to 22 ounces. I camped with Marshall on a charcoal hearth along the trail. Tried to call Toni with no luck and took a walk in the woods. I found five more hearths on the hillside.

Then a cold rain began. Walking through town I had a sense for the first time that I was walking through America. So far I have experienced a sense of the beauty of my country on this walk, but today I experienced a feeling of the people also. Many hikers commented that Duncanon seemed to be a sad town, but having experienced the rust beltbefore, I guess what I saw was the open heartedness of the folks. Several people spoke to me as I walked along, others waved. I enjoyed he town. As I looked out from the view it dawned on me that I most likely had a signal, and I was able to call Toni. A young hiker named Smut but or something like that came by and we chatted. As I left this great place it began to rain. The temperature dropped through the day. I headed for the shelter which had several cold and wet occupants. The rest of the day was spent drying out, eating, and idle hiker talk.

Another hiker warned me that today was the opening of turkey season. The trail passed more evidence of PA's rich iron/coal history. I leapfrogged with my friends from Florida most of the day. Due to the weather they were debating cutting their hike short. Many sections of the trail were simply fields of boulders along which someone had painted a blaze on a nearby tree. I met a section hiker named Ellen (later named Still Burning) hiking PA. I arrived at the William Penn shelter about 345. I didn't like the vibe and after texting with Toni I decided to press on 4 more miles to the 501 shelter. Later I was told someone hanged themselves at that shelter. The four miles to the 501 contained the two fastest miles of the hike over smooth wide trail (two 20 minute miles) and the longest two miles of the trip over a continuous number of boulders.

Today was the final day of a three day stretch where I walked too far in order to stay in shelters in order to stay out of heavy rain which was predicted , but never actually happened. I arrived at the shelter to find Chafe talking to Skylark, who passed me back in Boiling Springs. Skylark has already resisted an attempt to change her name once but I'm now calling her coach. She gave me a lecture about not taking a zero yet.

The lack of big climbs has been made up for by the poor trail surface. And we are constantly told we haven't reached the rocky part yet. All the blogs, memoirs and books talk about the social aspect of the AT. There are a lot of hikers on the trail. So far they have been almost universally friendly, helpful, just nice folks. Each hiker takes care of themself, yet I sense folks are watching out for one another. As far as flip flopping as a way to do the hike goes, I have only heard of one full shelter so far. You usually walk for hours each day alone in the woods. The hikers from GA walk very fast and for amazing distances. The FFers are all waiting to get their trail legs.
