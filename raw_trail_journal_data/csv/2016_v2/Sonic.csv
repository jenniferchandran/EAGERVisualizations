Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522175,"We started our 5 day ( 76 mile ) trek in search of adverse conditions, such as rain or snow, in order to test out our gear. This is going to sound terrible, but we were thoroughly disappointed when the weather was 60 degrees and sunny most of the trip haha. It was absolutely perfect hiking weather ! The foothills trail was beautiful, and it had just about every thing a hiker could want. There were 5 different river gorges, Huge waterfalls around every corner, and breathe taking views ! While we were out there we only saw 2 people, both of which were fellow hikers. The solidarity was nice, but very strange and hard to get used to. We found ourselves extremely excited at the sight of a sign or even a road because we might get to see someone, or get an idea of where we were and how far we had walked. On the last night we decided to stealth camp near the top of Sassafras Mountain, the highest point in South Carolina. That night the temperature got down to 14 degrees and the winds reached 30 MPH !! I can't say we were comfortable, but we got a good bit of sleep and stayed fairly warm throughout the night. One major concern we had (in the middle of the night) was the stability of our tarp tent. We were ready for the wind to collapse our tent at any second, but the Sierra Designs Tensegrity held up admirably! All in all we felt that our gear performed well, although we had a minor spork malfunction. We averaged about 17 miles per day, and I think this was a little ambitious pace to start at, considering we were both very tired and soar by the last day. We learned a lot, and we are super excited to start our AT thru hike on March 6th.","Oconee State Park Georgia

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522263,"The final countdown is on ! With less than 4 days until departure, excitement and packing efforts are at an all time high. In hopes of saving money and time, we decided to pack all of our meals in advance and ship them to ourselves. We have 36 boxes that we are shipping to various trail towns along our trek. We have 4 meals each day that total around 4,000 calories. I guarantee we will be sick of everything we packed by Harper's Ferry (half way). For breakfast we have packed a 1,000 calorie shake, comprised of powdered whole milk, carnations instant breakfast, protein powder, and ground vegetables. It tastes like Chocolate! We have two 1,000 calorie lunches which are both an assortment of granola bars, trail mix, Peanut Butter crackers, etc. Dinner has a base of either cous cous, instant rice, noodles, or quinoa, with chicken or sausage and freeze dried vegetables! We have assembled almost 1,000 meals for the two of us over the next 4 months. It has been tedious work, and we are so glad to have this part of our trip behind us. Although we will probably looking back on how easy this was after a couple months on the trail. A special thank you to our parents and girlfriends for their help in the packing and planning process! We are going to spend the last few nights in civilization enjoying cable tv, our beds, and soft pillows! Next stop Springer Mountain Georgia !","

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522794,"Today was our first day on the trail. We woke up at 5:30 this morning and departed at 6:15 for our assault on springer mtn. After a beautiful drive we got on the trail in good spirits around 11, we may have gotten a little lost getting there...we hiked the mile back to springer accompanied by our entourage(Courtney, mom, Pam and Susan), thank you guys for all the love and support. Once we said goodbyes we headed up trail. It was a beautiful clear skies and Early on we met our first through hiker Brian Migliano (drummer boy). He was 23 and just graduated college, so we had a good bit I'm common. We hiked with him until 8 miles in at hawk mountain shelter. Sassafras mtn. Was up next, for being the biggest peak of the day the uphill wasn't terrible but the downhill took a toll on both of our knees. At the top we stopped for lunch and saw an unknown critter, possibly a Martin, or groundhog? After that we reached cooper gap. We saw Austin (coworker) for the first time at the bottom. There was a guy doing some trail magic so we got some clementines. There was also a big tank of potable water, which was nice after the tough climb at sassafras. After that we rolled into camp at Justus creek. Eli took his sleeping pad out of the stuff sack only to find it covered in mold (classic Eli). I am trying to think of a trail name that involves mold for him. It was good camping with Austin. Stayed up a little later than usual, but were still in bed by 9. All in all a good first day on the trail couldn't have asked for much more. Onto bull gap tomorrow!","springer mountain

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522852,"We packed up camp this morning and said bye to our good friend Austin. We knew we were going to have to hike a long way to reach Neal's gap, where our mom had left a package full of food for us. The overcast weather turned to sun and warm skies by mid morning. We met a lot of other really nice hikers as the day continued. It seems accustom to say ""happy trails"" to one another as you part ways. The trail had a lot of elevation gain (and loss) today, and we found there to be many good views! Preacher's rock was the first of many great sights the Georgia mountains had to offer. Around 3 o'clock we started our first real climb up blood mountain, which is the highest point on the Georgia section of the AT ! of course Eli and I both ran out of water about half way up, luckily we were very hydrated. When we reached the top we met shaggy, bushhog, James, and a whole bunch of spring breakers from Florida State. The spring breakers felt bad for us and offered food, which we turned down for some reason.... Blood mountain was our favorite climb and view of the trail so far! We descended a very steep 2 miles with our new friends to Neil's gap, which was very unpleasant for our knees. Mountain crossing is a small outpost that the trail runs right through. It is the only place on the trail that goes under a roof ! We collected our package and pitched camp behind the outpost in the woods. While we were hanging out we got to eat the left over hot dogs that hadn't been purchased that day, true trail magic. The second day was another one for the books and we can't wait to see what tomorrow has to hold.","justus creek

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522952,"Today started off pretty slow we hung out at neel's gap till around 9. While Eli was sitting at the overlook next to mountain crossings this lawyer came up and gave him a pocket constitution. As I'm writing this he still has it so our friend shaggy have him the trail name the patriot. With our new found love of country we set off, the day started out with tough climbs but scenic views. At Tesnatti gap we ran into some more trail magic. I soon regretted the root beer and rice Krispy treat though because the climb out of the other side was pretty brutal. Shaggy, who we hiked with all day, cut his hand on his poles on the way up so it gave us a nice excuse for a break at the top. We knew we didn't have to hike as far today, so we took our time and stopped at every overlook. None of us thought that Georgia would be this nice! I think we might have spoke too soon because the last 5 miles of our day was a monotonous climb on an old fire road. We camped that night at poplar stamp gap with sparky and shaggy. We had an a great fire and good times! Everyone we have talked to is dreading the 3 days of rain that is forecasted for Thursday... We are going to try and wake up early tomorrow and get in 16-17 miles if we can. Hiawassie Georgia, here we come!","Neel's Gap

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523030,"We woke up this morning and said goodbye to our camp mates sparky and vagabundo (spelling?). We had planned to hike 15 miles to trey mountain shelter, and stop and pick up a package in hiawassie Georgia, which is 13 miles west of the trail. The first nine miles to Unicoi gap flew by. The trail seemed to be mostly flat so we made it to the gap by 11:30. We sat down by other thru hikers, and thought about how we were going to get into town. Before we could stick our thumbs out several day hikers came over and asked if we needed a ride into town. Dave and Robin Hering showed us some REAL trail Magic by taking us right to the post office in town. Not to mention they help maintain the Section of trail we just walked! Thanks guys for everything you do! When we got to the post office we collected our package and charged our phones. While we were loading out packs with food a man came in and asked if we needed a ride. Long story short we made back to the trail in under and hour and we didn't have to stick our thumbs out once! I wish hitchhiking could always be that easy! With heavy packs the ensuing climb up from Unicoi and up trey mountain was difficult. It was about 3,000 feet of elevation gain. We hiked the remaining miles to camp with David (das machine) (he's German). His name is das machine because he hikes really fast and never stops... So that was fun trying to keep up with him. We made it to camp to find all of our trail friends! We talked and told stories and went to bed at hiker midnight (7:30 pm). The weather was absolutely perfect today and we are worried because the weather has been too good for us lately. Hopefully this weekends storms won't be as bad as predicted. Off to plum tree shelter tomorrow!","Poplar Stamp Gap

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523160,"I woke up this morning to a splash on my face. The rain was coming in sideways through our door, unfortunately the weather forecast and the previous night's starry sky had betrayed us. I zipped up the cover to the door,but forgot to move my boots. When We finally gathered the courage to leave the tent my shoes, filter, and clothes dry bag were very wet. Breaking camp was interesting. It sucks having the tent get muddy and wet, and then stuffing it into a foot long sack. Needless to say everything was muddy when we pulled out the tent tonight. Anyways when we did hit the trail we descended for an hour or so in thick fog. I couldn't help but wonder what sights we were missing as we trudged along. The next big climb was up to Kelly's knob was grueling, especially in rain gear. When we got to the top we were rewarded with clouds and a three mile downhill to dicks gap. We made it to dicks gap around 12. I think when it is foggy we walk faster. At dicks gap we checked out the top of Georgia hostel. It's a cool place where we dropped off our trash, but most importantly got free soda. After another tough climb we made it into plum orchard shelter around 430. We made red beans and rice and played our first cards of the trip with das machine, outlaw, and hulk. We are beginning to find walking partners who we get along with and go a similar pace. I've been told Unicoi to dicks gap is the toughest section in Georgia, and I'd have to agree. Tomorrow we climb standing Indian mtn and go into North Carolina so it should be exciting!","tray mountain shelter

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523363,"We woke up this morning to a nice sunrise. Neither words or pictures can truly do it justice. We headed toward beech gap which was about 15 miles away. We thought this would be easy considering we had been hiking about that much mileage each day. Wow it was hard! We had several major climbs that stuck it to our legs. Within the first four miles we reached the North Carolina and Georgia border, it is nice to see progress in this form. We took a break and snapped some pictures with the sign. The rest of the day was full of high peaks and nice views! Standing Indian mountain was the tallest peak, but the 1,500 foot elevation gain was over 2 miles so the grade of the trail really wasn't that bad. The thing that made it difficult was that das machine and Eli were so competitive with each other that we basically ran up the mountain.... After running up, we walked 2 miles back down to find the campsite. We were all quite relieved to sit down and put out crocs on! It was honestly one of the harder days on trail, but spirits are still high because we have dodged all the rain. Tomorrow we are planning on hiking 16 miles to rock gap shelter, and we are hoping for some weekend trail magic  !","plum orchard shelter

Although it wasn't sunny, it was definitely clear enough to see the beautiful views the mountains had to offer. Today was a nice hike because it was mostly flat or downhill.... Imagine that. We hiked 10 miles before 12:30, das machine and Eli tend to race when out front. We had one of the most amazing sections of trail today up mount albert. This section of trail uses natural rock formations as stairs. The iconic white blaze is tagged on the rock ! At the top of the climb we were rewarded with epic views, created by an old fire tower. This part of the trail also marked the 100 miles mark ! We hiked the remaining 6 miles to shelter where we found many other thru hikers, probably around 20? The shelter was full so we found a small campsite close by. Most of the other hikers are taking a zero day in Franklin, NC tomorrow, but we have elected to hike through the, seemingly imminent, rain to wayah bald! We are hoping to meet my girlfriend Courtney at winding stairs gap with food and some company  ! We played spades tonight with some new friends and turned in early !

When you are in the trail for so long (it seems like it has been forever) you look forward to strange things. Seeing signs, meeting old friends, and highway crossings are things we all get pumped about. We met my girlfriend Courtney at winding stairs gap around 10 ! It was hard get out of the tent this morning because it was daylight savings and it was raining. Stuffing a wet tent into my backpack makes me cringe every time, but I think it will dry out tonight, as the weather channel says it will not rain. We came across a cooler full of empty beer and Coke cans, we were just a little too late for the trail magic . It seemed like we climbed forever to reach wayah bald! It was weird because the trail came out onto a paved greenway for about a quarter of a mile, we thought we were lost. When we got to the fire tower, we were greeted by many day hikers, it was a great view ! Eli was given a pack of deer jerky and cheese ! It hit the spot ! We made it to wayah bald shelter and pitched our tent. Eli elected to sleep in the shelter, which apparently had some mice encounters in the middle of the night. We camped with about 20 other hikers and talked well after hiker midnight. We wrongfully brought up the real food... The thought of burgers at NOC made us crazy. Can't wait to make it to NOC tomorrow to see our dad, and get some warm food and a shower !","rock gap shelter

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523560,Today the excitement to get to NOC was real. We woke up early to get to Nantahala Outdoor Center before the thunderstorms forecasted for later in the day. We woke up early and das machine was ready to roll. We followed him and knocked out the first 10 miles to Weser bald in 5 hours. At Wessex bald we got a beautiful view of the mountains and rested our legs for the 6 mile descent to NOC. Dad machine dictated the pace so we managed to do this leg in a couple hours. Dad was coming at 4 to pick us up so we killed some time by shopping around in the store and chatting with hikers. In the end we were all glad when dad got here and we could get our first real food in 9 days. We went up to Hilda's that night. We showered and washed our clothes which felt spectacular. Hilda was very nice and made us cookies. Looking forward to rovers end for breakfast!,"wayah bald shelter

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523791,"Last night we didn't have to hang a bear bag for the first time in a while. It was a nice feeling to have a totally flat area to sleep on and lights in the morning when it was dark. Thanks to my dad Jason (honorary trail name backtrack) for the place to stay, 2 warm meals, and of course all the support throughout our trip ! After a huge breakfast at rivers end we set off on what was the longest climb we had yet to encounter. My dad decided to park at stecoah gap and meet us at cheoah bald, so we had the option to slack pack The 8 mile climb. Slack pack is when you take most of the weight out of your pack so you're only carrying water and food, it makes hiking much easier when your pack is this light. Of course our friend David (das machine) thought that would be cheating so he wanted to carry his whole weight. Eli couldn't be outdone by David and I couldn't be outdone by Eli so we ended up carrying everything..... We would soon regret that. The climb out of the nantahala outdoor center was almost 8 miles up to cheoah bald ! The weather was beautiful, but the temperature was around 70 degrees, we sweated a lot climbing up the mountain. The views at cheoah bald were well worth it though, it was possibly one of my favorite places thus far. We hung out for an hour at the top and soaked up some rays waiting for my dad to arrive. We headed down the mountain a mile or so before we ran into my dad. He had walked several miles down an old road before realizing he was not on the AT, hence the name backtrack. The next miles to stecoah gap were continuously up and down and really took a toll on our legs and feet. Tired, thirsty, and exhausted we finally reached the gap. We were wary of the remaining 2.5 miles which looked to be all up hill to the shelter. Luckily we ran into Bob (aka quest) who had brought apples to help get us up the mountain. Thanks Bob, we couldn't have done it without you ! The next bit to camp was every bit as steep as it looked on the map. It was definitely the longest 2.5 miles of my life. We finally made it to camp around 6:30 to find some familiar faces and a big tasty dinner ! Looking back, this was definitely the most difficult day on the trail thus far, and a huge shoutout to the group (Eli, chase, David, Courtney) for the hard work and determination!

When we set out we had good views of Fontana and the surrounding areas early on. We ran into some serious trail magic. Vice hooked us up with some Coke and hot dogs (one of the things I crave most). Later on in the day it turned into a slow grind. One of the hardest parts was being able to see the dam for the last 5 miles. David and I finished at 145 right when Paxton and mom pulled up. 30 minutes later Zack, Chase, and Courtney made it down the hill. The best part of the day though was yet to come. Paxton and my mom (aka mountain momma and sweaters) drove us back to Candy's (honorary trail name candygram) cabin. When we got to the house we got to go to Tina Wesson's (honorary trail name the survivor) tiki lounge. We were treated to Brats, Salmon, chili, and various beverages. We also were able to get our permits printed for the smokies. After that we went to sleep on real beds for the first time since the trip started. We even got to shower !

It truly was the best trail magic yet ! My mom filled our stomachs with pancakes and sausage early this morning before driving to the trail ! We knew we would need a lot of fuel to make the climb into the smokies and all the way to spence field shelter (about 18 miles). The first 6 miles were straight uphill, but it honestly wasn't as bad as we expected. The previous climb out of NOC prepared us well ! We were rewarded for our efforts with a great view from the shuckstack fire tower. Eli and I have done so much hiking in the smokies over the years, so it was cool to be on a familiar part of the trail. We had a nice view of cades cove throughout the day. Once we got on top, we stayed on the ridge line with relatively small ups and downs. We were all so happy to make it to the shelter around 5. Our legs and feet were killing us.... Tomorrow we are hitting Rocky too early and trying to make it 19 miles to dodge some predicted snow on Sunday. Anyone from Knoxville that wants to meet us for a day is more than welcome !

Carl said: ""well would you rather a bear drag you out by your head or by your feet?"" We unanimously decided that feet was the correct answer. We slept surprisingly well despite that disturbing image. We woke up at 6 in order to get an early start on our long trek towards mount Collins shelter (19 miles away). We got walking around 7:30 with our headlamps, and we made it to the peak of rocky top right as the sun came over clingman's dome! Pictures could not do the seen justice, and words cannot describe how the group felt. It was a truly beautiful moment that you wish could last forever! The ensuing miles followed the ridge line of the mountains, and we enjoyed more spectacular views. With blue bird skies and 65 degree weather we couldn't help but to stop and enjoy the best views and balds the smokies had to offer. After seeing clingman's dome we walked another 4 miles to camp at mount Collins shelter. The shelter was full of spring breakers from Maryland so we had to sleep outside, but they promised they promised to give us their food tomorrow at newfound gap so it is all good ! Haha it was a really long day and we are all tired, but it has by far been the best day on the trail. The weather and sights were just too good !

The night before, over a heated game of Mao, some spring breakers from the university of Maryland promised us their leftover food if we made it to newfound gap before they left. Seeing that they had already left we, quickly packed our stuff, and sprinted out the camp. Unfortunately Atticus (formerly das machine) and I dropped spidey and Goose (Zack) pretty early on. That left the job up to just David and me. The miles flew by, but as we approached the gap I realized one problem. In my haste I had forgotten to take my morning privy visit, as I stopped to relieve myself, the torch fell to the one man who could save us... Das machine (sorry David). By the time I finished things up Goose and spidey had met up with me so we had a nice stroll to the gap. When we got there we were overjoyed to see a white sprinter van with Maryland tags, Atticus, and a whole passel of college girls. We got Hershey's, Nutella, instant eggs, and all sorts of other goodies. Immediately after, we met mountain momma and Godspeed who hooked us up with some killer trail magic. Including, but not limited to, sandwiches, Fritos, Swiss rolls, and soft drinks. After that, another ex thru hiker gave us some mtn dew, and whazo gave us some sausage since he was going into town. Needless to say I didn't finish all my lunch. We set off from newfound gap, and were met with intermittent rain, big spruces, and big views. At ice water springs we saw a couple fox squirrels and deer. At first I thought it was cool they were so comfortable with humans, but then I realized they had most likely been fed, and it was a little depressing. Charlie's bunion was incredible. The whole day reminded me a lot of the PNW because there were these sprawling mountains covered in mist and massive evergreens. Atticus and I rolled into Peck's shelter around 2:30. It was perfect timing for two reasons: one Atticus decided not to drink any water after newfound gap so he almost passed out, and two a huge rain cloud came in right when we sat down. Since we knew we had an easy day tomorrow we took it easy and played lots of cards. Atticus and I beat spidey and goose three times. Red beans and rice turned out to be not that good. As I am writing this there is a bit of drama in the shelter, a mouse has crawled on goose's hand twice. So if you don't see another blog post I might've been carried of by mice and eaten. All in all, these last couple of days have been my favorite so far, a ton of cool people, the most cards of the trip, but, most importantly I saw a lot of the smokies I'd written of before. It all turned out to be way more beautiful than I could've imagined and I'm pretty stoked on life right now.","mount collins

We could sleep in a little bit and still make it to the shelter at a good time. Of course none of us slept past 7.... Nevertheless we hung out and waited for most of the crowd to clear out of the shelter before packing out stuff up. The snow that was predicted to happen that night started a little early, probably around 11. Because most of our walk was downhill we got quite cold and ended up running most of the way to camp. Wind beaten and cold we arrived around 2 at the shelter. The fireplace still had a small fire burning and someone had left a whole thing of hot chocolate and coffee mix for the hikers ! We quickly set up our stuff and got in our sleeping bags ! We played, what seemed like, hours of cards before someone else finally showed up. In the end it turned out to be a full shelter ! Most were spring cold spring breakers. This one group from Elon university showed up and made the most extravagant dinner ever.There had to be 4 courses to this meal.

We knew we were meeting mom 9 miles away at pigeon river bridge, so we had a lazy morning. For some reason I volunteered to get the bear bag while everyone else stayed warm in their sleeping bag. I made the mistake of going in my crocs so I started the day with very wet feet. The spring breakers from Elon were back at it again with French toast and brownies for breakfast, so my protein shake seemed even more unappetizing than usual. When we finally left we were all awe struck by the glistening snow and frost. We hiked for about three miles and then made it to Mt. Cammerer. We hung out there for a while and caught up on blogging and eating. The past couple of days I've felt my appetite rise with the amount of calories I've been burning to stay warm. It was bittersweet when we finally descended from Cammerer, I was warming up but the snow was melting. We arrived at the bridge a little early and cleaned off in the nearby creek, filtered water, and dried clothes. Unfortunately, Atticus's gators dug into his feet funny on the downhill so he's been nursing his foot ever since. When mom got there we gorged ourselves on pizza, ginger beer, and brownies. It was delicious and much appreciated by everybody. We shared some of our spoils with a thru hiker named North Star.

Atticus was concerned that he wouldn't be able to walk very well because his foot was hurting him. With this in mind we made plans to go to groundhog creek shelter 5 miles away. Since we were going so little miles we decided to sleep in a little later than usual. When we did wake up, we went to get the bear bag and found it was stuck. Luckily one of our neighbors came to the rescue with a large stick. After this incident we got talking and befriended ash, fat sister, bean, and weatherman, a hardy group of north easterners. We finally rolled out of camp around 10:30 with a group 8 long. We quickly realized that a group of anymore than 4 is a bit cumbersome, and information often is altered going front to back. The whole 5 miles to groundhog creek was like a giant game of telephone. When we made the 5 miles Atticus decided he could probably push for the next shelter 7 miles away. On the trail we started hiking with North Star. Nothing too exciting happened until we made it to max patch, where we got some trail magic and met up with our friends Waldorf, stattler, Zataran's, and tarp. They were skipping ahead to hot springs. We pushed on from max patch, and when we made it to the shelter David was still feeing good so we decided to push on to the next shelter making it an 18 mile day in total. We did this so we'd have an easy 13 mile jaunt into hot springs. We finally made it to Walnut Mountain around 530. We had several mouse sightings before bedtime so the nerves were high.

We broke camp around 7:30 and set out. Elevation wise it was a pretty easy day, and view wise it was very sub par. There was a lot of time to ourselves because we walked separately. We finished the 20 miles around 3:30, and quickly ate dinner and hung a bear bag just before the rain started.

We set off at a brisk pace, with the thought of the 21.9 miles ahead looming in the back of our head. We went though some sections that had slick exposed ridge lines with what I assume would be good views, but unfortunately the clouds were dense all around us and we couldn't see a thing. When we made it six miles up the trail to Jerry's cabin the fog finally started to cook off. We ventured on and made it to the next shelter were we met our first sobo. We hiked another two miles where we separated, Atticus and spidey hiked on, and goose and I stayed and made some calls. The next section was a 3 miles uphill that we were determined to catch Atticus on. Goose and I cooked it it up a seemingly endless uphill until we finally caught Atticus. Then we had a little downhill, and one final uphill push until the shelter. At the end of 22 miles your legs are done, and so we crawled into camp around 5, then commenced to do a solid 20 minutes of just sitting with no will or muscular strength to do anything. Had a nice dinner of Mexican rice and then sat around a fire a couple of hours. Tomorrow we might do twenty again to have an easy day into Erwin. It seems crazy to think two days ago I had never done twenty and tomorrow might be my third.","Little Laurel shelter

We had a leisurely pace for the first two miles into Sam's gap. Here we waited for Chris (my friend) and Betsy (his mom) for around 30 minutes, at this point Atticus and Spidey continued on. Immediately after they left some hikers from the Charlotte hiking club showed up with a killer trail magic spread. We had hot dogs, muffins, Coke, and Gatorade. Then maybe 10 minutes later Chris and Betsy showed up with bacon, egg, and cheese melts and juice. Atticus and spidey missed out. We then hiked around 6 miles with Chris and Betsy. We hung out on the bald for a bit and then started our 11 miles to camp. It was a fairly monotonous section and after a third day of 20 miles my legs are over hiking. When we got into camp we found out spidey had been urinating blood. One of our fellow hikers recommend he eat an ounce of charcoal and flush it with a liter of water. Spidey without hesitation tried it. I was skeptical, but we'll see if it saves us a doctors visit tomorrow. Only 6.2 miles into Erwin tomorrow. It'll be our shortest day yet and a much needed recovery.","hog back ridge shelter

We had heard stories of all you can eat buffets, phone charging, and showers in Erwin Tn, all of which were things we desperately desired. We woke up early and got into town around 10. My girlfriend Courtney (aka pinky) was the first to greet us. She drove us straight to PIZZA PLUS, an all you can eat buffet. We worried that the buffet would be closed since it was Easter Sunday, but luckily they were opening right as we pulled in. I didn't think it was possible for 4 humans to eat as much pizza as we did. After we couldn't eat anymore we headed to the laundromat to wash our clothes. My good friend Brandon Roy ( aka beaver) picked us up from the laundromat and took us back to his place for burgers on the grill ! First we all showered ! It was quite satisfying to get all the dirt off of my legs. We ate as many burgers as we could, watched tv, and enjoyed the use of the Internet all at once. At this point you would think we would be full right, but we had to top off the end of the day with ice cream. It was the best NERO day we could have asked for. We got all the food we could want, we got to shower, and we had great company with good friends ! Thank you so much to Brandon and Alexis for the hospitality and generosity, you guys are awesome and it was so good to see you ! Also special thanks to Courtney for coming out and helping us, and good luck on your med school interview ! Tomorrow we are headed towards Roane mountain.

We picked up some breakfast from pals and then we were dropped off at the trailhead. We started hiking and the first couple of miles were nice and easy next to the Nolichucky and one of its tributaries, but then we had a brutal climb up and out of the gorge. About two miles later we came to a road gap and got some trail magic from brother Tom. He told us that the next few miles had a nice uphill to unaka mountain, but that once you got on top you were in this really dense spruce forest, they called the emerald forest.Two miles before unaka there was a big bald where you could get a nice view of Erwin, Johnson City, and unaka mountain. Luckily the push up to the top ended up being doable. On top of Unaka the forest was beautiful, and definitely lived up to its reputation.

After giving him a hard time, we squeezed in for the last few remaining hours of darkness. The plan was to walk about 19 miles to camp on the grassy bald of roan mountain. We had heard such good things about this area we had a lot of motivation to start hiking. The morning was fairly uneventful, and by 1 o'clock we had reached the base of the roan mountain climb. The climb spanned over 4 miles and proved to be very difficult. We were all tired, hungry, and out of water by the top. We had to stop and eat icicles near the top because we were so thirsty. Brandon gets the mvp award for hanging tough on such a brutal day. We descended into carver's gap, where we sent Brandon back to civilization. After a small break we headed up to the famous roan mountain balds around 5:30. The views truly lived up to all the hype! If you have never been to this area it is definitely worth checking out, it does not feel like you are in TN/NC. As we crested the second bald we could see a plume of smoke in the distance. As we got closer, we realized there was a small brush fire on the second bald. We met some hikers who had already called the authorities, who eventually came and put the fire out. The fire ran right up to the trail, so luckily we were able to make it through. We decided to cowboy camp ( no tent just sleeping bag on the grass) on the third bald. With 360 degree views, the sunset was truly amazing ! We watched until the star came out. It was beautiful ! Things got really cold that night but we were determined to stay in our bags because David had bet we would all end up crawling in his tent when we got cold. Thank goodness we made it through the night ! Haha it was truly amazing day because we felt like we had seen a little bit of everything, and we were truly challenged the whole way.

We rolled out around 8, and quickly made it to the Overmountain shelter which is one of the coolest shelters we've seen yet. It's an old barn converted to a shelter, that overlooks a beautiful valley. We filled up with water and then left the shelter and did a brutal climb up to yellow mountain which had a big clearing on top then down and back up an even bigger bald called hump mountain. The roam highlands have been one of my favorite sections so far, huge 360 degree views on every mountaintop. After that we descended past doll flats and to the final NC TN border. Two states down 12 to go. It was at this point that we realized Goose and I's resupply at Vango Abbey Hostel was not at 393 and actually at 405. So we decided we'd get to the shelter at 401 and see if we wanted to keep going. That means we had at least 11 miles if not 15 to go. With that in mind we put down some serious miles. Along the Elk river I saw a mink which is about the coolest animal I've seen so far. We all made it to the shelter around 5 feeling pretty good. So we decided to try and do the last four miles; somehow justifying it with thoughts of pizza and wifi. As soon as we left the shelter I noticed my toes were blistering, but we kept on. Finally we got to laurel fork gap where the side trail for the hostel was, but we didn't see anything. So we figured it must be up the hill a ways. We hiked another .75 miles in the fading light when we realized it had to have been back at the gap. So we walked all the way back with raw feet and tired muscles. When we got back down there was a moment of despair when we still couldn't find the trail. Right when we were about to pitch the tent in the middle of the trail I spotted a blue blaze 100 yards up the laurel fork creek, and then a saw bushwacking trail leading up to it. We followed this micro trail for about a quarter mile and were greeted by the sight of a confederate flag. Atticus remarked, ""Maybe it's the neighbors."" It was not. We rolled up and met Trekkie the hostel owner. He was a really nice dude and gave us a room and a frozen pizza for ten bucks each. Unfortunately the oven in the bunk room didn't work so I ended up eating mine cold. This seemed like the better alternative to Goose's microwaved pizza. The hostel is also covered in lady bugs, hundreds of them are in the room. It's a little unsettling. In total we did 27.1 miles, and I can definitely say my feet hate me right now.","grassy bald Roan Mtn.

My feet were still pretty ravaged from yesterday, so the only solution was to cover them in the rest of our roll of medical tape. We didn't leave the hostel until ten. We knew there was rain in the forecast for 12 so we needed to hurry, but we quickly found out how difficult it was to go fast after 27 miles. Goose and I's feet were torn up, and Atticus had really sore muscles, spidey seemed to be the only one to escape without harm. We trudged on anyway, ignoring our ailments, for better or worse. The rain was fickle. Atticus said, ""There are many frustrating things about America, guns, politics, but by far the worst of all is your weather forecasting."" Rain was predicted almost the whole day and we maybe got rained on for 45 minutes. At this point I can't help but feel like we've had so little rain that it's all just going to be unleashed at once in a storm of biblical proportions, but until then I'm content to enjoy the sunshine and dry clothes. Anyways, we eventually made it to pond mountain wilderness, and what the rest of the day lacked in beauty the final two miles made up for. The beginning followed the laurel fork as it meandered through a cliffed out gorge, and then we made it to the falls which were equally amazing. If it hadn't been raining at this point I think we all might've hopped in for a swim. We made it to the shelter around 4, and had a leisurely night. On to Hampton tomorrow!","Vango Abbey Hostel

After our shopping Doug took us out to McDonald's, and I ate not one but two Big Macs. Thanks a ton Doug. We then put back on the trail and started walking around watauga lake.

The first thing we did was grab some food. We picked up a delicious burrito from hey joes and then went and picked up our resupply box from Mount Rogers Outfitters. We had to stuff ourselves with any leftover food from the last few days because it was a 5 day resupply, our largest yet. We have food shoved in all the different pockets of the pack. It was funny walking around town, and seeing all these people that we'd past a while go. The best part though was that they all kept asking das machine if he was okay, he was of course annoyed by this. It's amazing how quickly word travels in the thru hiker circles. Anyways we left Damscus at 3 and had 8 miles to go till we hit the next shelter. About half way through we got to a trail reroute due to a washed out bridge. We decided to skip the reroute because we figured we could cross any creek with how little it had rained, but mostly we didn't want to leave the actual AT. When we got to the creek Atticus, Spidey, and I made it across fine, but on the last rock Goose slipped and fell in. Fortunately the inside of his bag had stayed dry but his shoes and shirt were soaked.

It was a nice section paralleling the VA creeper trail, and then the trail turned up for the two mile climb to the shelter and things got rough.

We guessed it was gusting to around 20 to maybe even 30 mph.

There were also huge outcroppings of rocks and little to no vegetation. We walked about three miles and then made it to Grayson highlands. The best part about the highlands was even more wild ponies. I tried to pet one but it had other ideas and trotted off. As we trekked on I started to realize the scale of the highlands, by far the biggest balds we've seen yet.

The last mile and a half into town seemed to be all uphill. We ate dinner at Hardee's around 9:30 and checked into the motel across the street at 10. We immediately collapsed and fell asleep. 12 hours of hiking and 35 miles, it was quite the sense of accomplishment!","Lick Skillet Hollow

I took a shower, and then the Doritos for breakfast, while watching Stanley cup highlights. City life at its finest. We didn't leave the motel till 11. We started off with 5 miles of climbing. It was tough but we made it up to the ridge and got a view of WV to one side and VA to the other. We then hiked along the ridge for a few miles and stopped for a late lunch. We've hiked on so many rocky Virginia ridge lines they are all starting to blend. We started playing the city game and cranked out some more miles, but the late start made it hard for any of us to find real motivation. By the time we hit five o clock we still had 7 out of 21 miles left. Atticus went forward to the shelter leaving goose, spidey, and me to suffer alone. We didn't make into camp until 730. We stayed at pine swamp shelter. The name was a little perplexing considering there were no pines or swamps nearby.

The coolest part about his house is that there is a zip line over the creek to get to his house ! The zip line was definitely the highlight of my day ! Once we got over to his house we enjoyed a soft drink, wifi, and the company of his dogs. After a bit of relaxing we headed out on the trail again. We were met with a serious, rocky uphill which was not fun considering how hot it had gotten. After a lot of ridge running we marched downhill into a gap. We took a break at the shelter and talked to our new friends trouble and lucky duck. We trudged once more up the mountain before reaching laurel creek shelter. Another long day of hiking in the books ! Our feet were grateful to rest after the 19 mile day.

Fifteen minutes faster than our usual hour which was good since we had 23 miles. We started with a a 2 mile flat to the biggest keffer oak in the country, then had a steep 1000 foot climb. After that we ran a long the ridge for 8 miles, from the ridge we had good views of the valleys down below. Atticus and I got to widay shelter which was thirteen miles in around12. It was a good start to the day, but after that I quickly lost motivation. We hiked two miles and then stopped to filter water before our second big uphill. Filtering water turned into a 30 minute break in an effort to put off the climb. After about an hour we made it up the 2.5 mile hill and passed some boyscouts. At the top there was a war memorial to Audie Murphy the most decorated soldier I'm world war 2. A little ways down the trail we saw magic who had just thrown up a couple times. We think it might've been from dehydration, either way we drank a good bit of water after that. After this we had 4 miles down and 1 mile up to the shelter. The downhill seemed to take forever , and the whole time I was miserable. Amazingly though we met a VT professor and his wife who where handing out coke. It's amazing how the one little act can totally change your day. After that I knocked out the uphill no problem and wasn't even scared when I saw an 18 inch snake.

Our legs were tired from the previous couple of days so we wanted to start early and walk slow. We were headed out of camp around 6:30 and headed to the dragons tooth. We got to the top rather early and enjoyed the last bit of morning light. We met several day hikers and hung out longer than we should have. The dragons tooth is a huge exposed rock that makes up the face of the mountain. We were able to climb up the rock and sit on the front, it was a nice place to hang out! We then headed down the trail toward our to our next point of interest, mcafee knob. When we reached the parking lot for mcafee knob we saw what seemed like at least 50 cars that filled the parking lot and overflowed down the mountain. As we trudged up the hill we passed an unbelievable amount of day hikers, all of which reassured us we were almost there. When we got to the top we were surrounded by people, it felt like an amusement park. We even had to wait in line to get a picture on the iconic rock. Needless to say we weren't very impressed with this section of trail. After being in the woods by ourselves for so long it was kind of strange/annoying to see all these people. We quickly left the knob and headed toward camp which was about 7 miles away. The last 2 to the shelter was all up tinker mountain. I think everyone was a little angry by the top because we were so tired and hungry. However, the view from the top made us forget all the pain. Tinker cliffs were had the least amount of hype, but in my opinion blew mcafee knob and dragons tooth out of the water. There was a great view of the sunset as the trail meandered along the cliffside. The best part was definitely that there was no crowd! Beat down and tired we made the remaining miles into camp. We made dinner and then immediately got into our sleeping bags.

It was sad to leave someone we've hiked 500 miles with, but hopefully his feet will get better and he can catch up with us later. Anyways, we decided to do 25 that day and we lucked out because it ended up being some of the easiest mileage we did the whole trip. We managed to make it to the mill gap over look (20 miles) by 4 which gave us some time to relax while we waited on Larry. While we were waiting magic found a tick on himself. That's the first tick we've seen, but I'd say it seems like it's becoming that time of year were we really have to start worrying. Larry pulled up around 430, and pulled out a full spread. We feasted on pastries, fruit, and sandwiches. He also brought is water for the next five dry miles. We left around 6, and saw a beautiful sunset on the ridge leading into Cove Mountain shelter.

In my opinion it wasn't quite legendary, but you could definitely go underwater. We all decided to pass on the swimming hole because it was a little chilly and overcast. From the map we could see that we had an 8 mile uphill approaching, and we really didn't want to start up the trail from our small break at the river. We trekked up the never-ending hill for what seemed like most of the day. After a while I kind of just forgot we were going uphill... A couple of miles from camp we came to a trail that led to a apple orchard falls, a drop of over 200 feet. The problem was that the trail down to the falls was a little over a mile off the AT. One of our cardinal rules is that we only go to overlooks or sights 0.5 miles or less off the trail. For some reason the group really wanted to go. We got down there to find a low flow waterfall (almost a trickle) falling maybe 50 feet, I'm not sure where they got 200. Needless to say the 1 mile walk back uphill thoroughly reinforced our cardinal rule. We walked the remaining few miles to where the trail crossed the parkway again. Here we met our uncle Larry, who again provided and amazing meal for us. He has spoiled us so bad with fresh fruit and meat every night that I am not sure if I will be able to go back to noodles when things are done. I could seriously write a whole blog post about this meal and how good it was, but I will spare you those details. Anyway, huge thanks to Larry and everything he has done for us ! He is our own personal trail magician. We walked the short distance to camp and got ready for bed. It is supposed to rain tomorrow which is a good and bad thing.

Rain jacket on you sweat out, no rain jacket and you get a nice shower. Anyways the first few miles were downhill and flew by, but after that we had a brutal climb up to highcock knob. The trail was straight up one side, straight down the other. Up on top of the knob though you could see for miles, it's amazing how quickly spring has taken hold. A couple of weeks everything was dormant, and now you can't see through the canopy. After the knob we bombed down the rest of the trail. We got to the walking bridge that everyone jumps off of, but it was still dark and rainy so no one felt like getting in. We made it across the river and met Larry who drove us into Glasgow. In Glasgow there is a community shelter with power, a microwave, and a hot shower, so we crashed there for the night. I'd say it was nicer than at least one motel we've stayed at. When we got there we showered and just hung out and talked. It was nice to have an easy day, and relax the muscles. Larry's friend Doug came and met us. We went to the best and only restaurant in Glasgow, Scottos. Surprisingly though I had one of the best calzones I've had in my life. Our table also had a prime view of one of the life size dinosaur models in Glasgow. After stuffing ourselves we went back to the shelter and played cards.

The park service has closed off a 19 mile stretch of the trail for a 10,000 acre forest fire that started about 2 weeks ago.

Anyway, we went to camp at the border of Virginia and West Virginia last night, but of course there were rocks everywhere so we walked down about a quarter of a mile. Here the ground was sloped but at least there were no rocks. We all crawled in David's tent for the night, which is only supposed to sleep 2 people. We did this because there was only space for one tent. The sleeping situation was not ideal, but we got some rest before the alarm at 2 went off. We packed up and Backtracked to the border. After setting foot in Virginia we took off down the trail. Of course it has rained all night, so the trail was a mess. There was literally a small river through the trail at some points. It was pitch black outside at this time so we accidentally splashed through all the big puddles. When it got light outside, around 6, our feet were soaked and our pants were covered in mud, but we had already covered 10 miles so that was good.

We decided we had come too far to stop here, so at 6 we set out to finish the last 10 miles. The end of the day was of course the hardest section of hiking, or maybe it just seemed that way cause we were so tired. We took our last break at a shelter near the top of Raven rocks.

There was no distinct trail because there were no trees to put blazes on, just piles and piles of rock. I'm sure there were blazes on the rocks, but at this point it was totally dark outside. We were all honestly a little frightened because we had totally lost the trail and we were all cold, tired, and hungry. One thing that kept us going was that there was absolutely no where to camp with all the rocks. We aimlessly wandered through the massive Boulder field for what seemed like a lifetime. When we got off of the rocks we split up in search of a blaze. Luckily Eli found one, so we bushwhacked our way back onto a trail. After a while we saw headlights on the road in the distance, and found ourselves in Pen Marr Park which we knew was close. We ran the last half mile to finally reach the Pennsylvania border/ Mason Dixon line. What started in the morning in the dark ended at night in the dark. We had been awake for 20 hours and hiked for almost 17 hours. We retreated to Pen Marr park and (probably illegally) camped in one of the pavilions. The challenge was grueling and painful, but in the end I would do it all over because there is something strangely satisfying about pushing your body to the limit. You will never know how far you can go until you try, but I think it is safe to say we all found our limit today. I hope we can all walk tomorrow. Haha sorry again the video updates didn't work out, and sorry this post was unusually long. Thanks to everyone for all the support ! Happy trails ! - Goose","Harpers Ferry

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531923,"Some days you wake up because the alarm goes off or because someone snorrs so loud that it's impossible to sleep. Today wasn't one of those days. This morning it was the sound of birds which would be considered a nice way of waking up. But it was seven o'clock and after the four-state-challenge and being awake for 20 hours straight it was definetly too early. The first question i asked myself is kinda obvious. How did the Penguins play( never watched hockey before i came over but Zac and Eli introduced me to it and it's easy. Screw the Red Wings, screw the Blackhawks, root for the Penguins who have Crosby (only player i knew before) and always take off the gloves when you beat each other)? So we looked it up and thankfully they won 3:2. After that it was the normal routine except for the fact that we didn't eat anything. We had to get into Cascade, Maryland to pick up the resupply package and an italian restaurant was on the way. After a 43 mile day definetly the right way to treat ourselves.Oh boy, that was good. The people who run Rocky's are from Italy and they know how to make a proper pizza or sub. They were huge, tasted awesome and weren't expensive at all. The dream of any thru hiker.Then we got to the post office to resupply and luckily the package was already there but a new pretty unusual problem came up. Sonic and Goois had way too much food since we ate at the italian place believing that the package wouldn't make it. They ended up with eight days worth of food for four days of hiking. Because we didn't want to leave anything we decided that they would take food for five days and i would take the rest even though i already had food for four days. Luckily an older woman gave us a ride back to the trail and we didn't had too hike the 1,3 miles we had too hike to get into Cascade.If we would have been efficient we could have been done by 12 but we weren't and at least i don't regret it. We started hiking atat 1 and suddenly a 15 mile day sounds suprisingly long especially after a short night with legs which were still regenerating from yesterday and a stomach that was completely full.The only small problem was that my tent was still wet from the stealthcamping the night earlier so i wanted to hit the Shelter as soon as possible. They still had to filter four liters of water and i didn't want to wait so long so i ended up putting in my headphones and listening to music for 5 hours until I hit the Shelter. Besides the filtering they also had to order new shoes which we will pick up in Duncannon and that's more than necessary. Its sad but they still refuse to join the scarpa hype-train which right now even hits the Internet and they stayed with the Hokas( scarpas are the shoes i'm wearing and they are more durable and too a certain degree waterproof so my feet stay dry and also clean). But enough of scarpa advertisment. I hope this post fits the blog and thanks to all the people that supported us. Good night, DAS MACHINE","PA border

We were pretty dukes because today was gonna be ""easy"" we had 30 miles, but PA is as flat as a pancake so we figured it wouldn't be to bad. Thirty minutes after we left the shelter the rain came. It reminded me of the scene in Forest Gump where it just rains and rains... And rains. The terrain was flat but we spent so much time dodging puddles we slowed down to half our usual pace. Zack and I's mesh trail runners quickly wetted through. So every step was nice and squishy. I personally started getting cold, and we decided it was best to stop early at around 18 miles. When we got into camp we filtered water and then just sat in our sleeping bags and talked and hung out. It took a day that was a real bummer and turned it into something pretty fun and enjoyable. That night we had the shelter all to ourselves so we totally stretched out and had stuff drying all over the shelter.

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532881,"We started this morning off really excited because it wasn't raining ! And as an added bonus we were going to eat ice cream for breakfast and sleep in a hotel that night. We made it to the pine grove furnace store before they opened at 8. It is tradition that hikers participate in the half gallon challenge after passing the half way point on the trail (which we had reached the day before). The half gallon challenge is to eat half a gallon of ice cream in one sitting. I think I didn't realize how much ice cream was in a half gallon. I thought it was like a, oh let's eat some ice cream to celebrate being half way sort of thing. About half way through I was not having fun anymore.... Just a bad brain freeze. Nevertheless, I had to will myself to finish all of it because David and Eli finished theirs. We got to sign in the half gallon club book and we got little wooden spoons as souvenirs for finishing. Not sure if that was worth the stomach ache. At this point time had really gotten away from us and we still had 27 miles to hike for the day so we kicked it into high gear. I gotta say we are loving the Pennsylvania terrain because it is extremely flat compared to other parts of the trail. It is pretty rocky in some stretches, but the overall flatness makes it easy to walk a long distances. The last 10 miles of the day was walking through corn fields, which felt kind of weird not being in the mountains, but the flatness was appreciated ! We hobbled into the days inn hotel conveniently just before the hockey game started. It was great to get all our clothes washed tonight, but by far the best thing about today was the sunshine. It seemed like it had been raining for way too long. Looking forward to hearing into Duncannon PA tomorrow for a resupply !","Toms Run Shelter

Luckily Zacks girlfriends brother lives in Harrisburg and we were able to call him and have him pick them up. Unfortunately, that all took a few hours and we didn't start our 22 miles day till 11. Luckily it was flat as a pancake. We knocked out our first 4 miles and talked to the first guy we met who started after us. We then climbed 1 out of 2 up hills for the day. At the top was the ""taj mahal"", supposedly the best privy on the trail. It was rather disappointing, a standard affair in the end.after that we followed the ridge for what seemed like forever and made it to Hawks rock which overlooked the sesquihanie river.

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532892,"We started early this morning, as usual, and navigated our way through the Pennsylvania rocks. Today was a day with very low motivation, and I am not quite sure why. I think all the rocks and the high mileage have got our spirits low. Nevertheless we trudged on. Today we ran into a lot of thru hikers called flip floppers. A flip flopper is someone who starts somewhere (say Harpers Ferry) and goes north Maine and then comes back and heads south to Georgia. There are a lot of flip floppers this year because the ATC recommended it to avoid the massive wave of hikers that started at springer. It's funny for us because it is like being back at the start, even though we have been on the trail for months. There are all these people on their first or second day with huge packs trying to find a hiking group and what gear to send home. We laugh to ourselves, and bet on which ones we think will make it all the way. Anyways, we had fun meeting all the new flip floppers today, and sharing our basic knowledge of the trail with them.we trekked on and made it to camp early. We camped in our tents tonight which the first time we have done that in a while. Also, we camped right next to a road which was good because our friend met us there with our new shoes! Thank goodness he was able to help us because the next outfitter is over 100 miles away and I don't think I could have worn my shoes another day. My feet were splitting out the sides.

We hiked a few more miles and made it to the 501 shelter where we found some chewy bars. Major trail magic. We met captain jack sparrow and then hiked on. As we walked onward nothing too exciting happened, until we saw a southbounder. At second notice we realized it was SEAM headed the wrong as usual. He left us in Daleville, VA do it was cool to finally catch him again. We did the last 11 miles into camp with him catching up on all that's happened.

The 9 miles into town were long and monotonous. The rocks in this section seemed so bad to me, yet I hear the worst is still yet to come. Anyway, we made it into the small town of Port Clinton and found our way to the barbershop. Besides the post office I think it is the only thing in town. The barbershop was exactly what you would think of in a small town. When we walked in there were two guys playing guitar and singing, they didn't look up when we walked in. The next few hours were full of insulting each other's home states (mostly Pennsylvania ) and other classic barbershop banter, it felt like something out of a movie ! After leaving Frank's shop we headed up the trail. The ensuing 15 miles were more classic PA rocks, which are really starting to get on our nerves. Our intended destination was eckville shelter, but there was no sign for the turn so Eli and I walked right by it. We found a campsite about half a mile down.

We woke up and got going decently quick, and headed out. About 7 miles in we hit a shelter full of kids. We found out it was a trip of high schoolers with a program lead by there school. It was pretty cool seeing kids my age, and it was their last day so they gave us all there extras, including a mountain house cheesecake. Also at the shelter were a pair of vintage Vasque sundowners, with a note saying that they were for whoever wanted them. Since they were a woman's size 7 they wouldn't fit me, but I decided to carry them because I figured Paxton or mom might like them. Three miles later I regretted my decision, but I knew I had to keep carrying them or face the wrath of the group for babying out. It was a pretty hot day, so when I ran out of water I knew I needed to get more the only problem was the only water source for six miles was .4 off trail at Tripoli campsite. It ended up being straight downhill and bug infested. I think dehydration was the better option. After that I kept going and hiked the knifes edge and bear rocks both had cool views, but were tough on our feet. We met two guys who actually ended up knowing tinker a 70 year old guy we met on our fifth day which was bizarre. The shelter that night was sweet and we stayed with Jack sparrow, seam, rambler, murder, worm, and obviously das machine. It was quite a crew.

According to the weather forecast there was about a 100% chance for most of the day. We knew there was going to be a tough climb at the marked superfund sight, and we definitely didn't want to do that in the rain. The superfund sight was a place where metals had previously been mined and the earth was void of all plant life. There was just a mountain of huge boulders. This climb was slightly enjoyable because it was actually like rock climbing in some areas, which was kind of fun. After making it off the huge rocks the rain started, and we trudged on through the small annoying rocks. At some point we got cold and tired of walking in the torrential rain, so we decided we would stop at the next shelter. This would be only 18 miles, a short day in comparison to our previous few weeks. We made it to the shelter around 2, and we couldn't have been happier.

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534200,Some days you wake up because the people are snorring or birds are singing. Today wasn't one of those days. Today everybody got woken up by a happy me and as always they really enjoyed getting up especially when it is 5:30. We started hiking an hour later and the first thing to do was reach Wind Gap to do laundry and send away the really nice boots Eli found (they carried that extra weight for 2 days). The three of them also went to Dunkin Donuts while I was doing the laundry so in the end a really nice morning. But it got even better. It got kinda hard to catch rides since we left the southern states so we normally had to hike the extra miles. This morning though we suprisingly got a ride after standing at the street for 5 seconds. We basically did laundry we ate donuts and caught a ride. Considering all that you might think hey there isn't much that could make this day even better but three little words can summarize the best thing that was about to happen. Good bye Pennsylvania. After finishing a state we used to make a final statement for the state that tries to summarize all of the experiences we had. Normally we always finished on a positive note but this time that was impossible. The first 150 miles were perfect for making miles which we appreciated. The terrain was flat with only a few uphills and as long as the rain didn't force us too aquablaze the trail was nice except for the fact that there was nothing to see. We were already making jokes that all the people who told us how Rocky it would be were wrong until we hit Port Clinton. After Port Clinton the funny part was gone. It was the same as before besides the fact that it got rocky and we had to walk with our heads down for 5 days straight which got incredible annoying on the last 2. So thank you Pennsylvania i won't miss you and i will try to never hike in you again.With the knowledge that we would leave the state after we passed through Delaware Water Gap we hiked the last 15 miles that were like the rest of the state. Only the last 2 miles were really nice and we were wondering if we were in Georgia again with all the rothadentron and the nice rock free trail. Around 4 we arrived in Delaware Water Gap and got new socks for Eli aand me. Zac also bought new tips for his trekking pole. That marked the moment were the real fun started. First of all we weren't able to take off the old tips and when we finally got them off we still needed the baskets but one of them was stuck one the old tip. To complete that situation it started to rain and another hiker named Jack Sparrow was waiting on us in a pizza place. So we decided to solve the problem later on and went to the pizza place to eat town food for the second time on that day (Eli often has a good mood but in that moment it was the heaven on earth for him).We finished the pizza around 5:30. Remember that time because that's the perfect example how effective we are the we're leaving towns.At 5:30 two of us wanted to use the bathroom so we could have left around 6. While they were doing their business zac tried to get of the basket by using his knife. Around 5:50 i also realized that a visit of the bathroom would be good. The moment i returned zac yelled that he cut his finger and he ran to the bathroom with eli and jack following him. It was a deep cut which was bleeding quite a bit. Nobody had a clue what to do so jack got the two tiniest bandaids i've ever seen and started to talk about some summer camp story while eli asked me what to do. I didn't know either because the only things I thought off would help him if the whole arm would have been cut off. After one minute off total chaos i reminded myself that it's basically like every normal cut so we waited until the bleeding stopped desinfected the wound and used all the medical stuff which I brought over from Germany that I had never expected to be off any use.When we finally left the city it was 7 and it started to get dark. We crossed the Delaware and on the other side there was a privy that I decided to use while they were going the last 4 miles to the campsite. When I got there Eli zac and seam were all hyped up because while I was gone they saw a raccoon playing in the creek and they finally saw a bear crossing the trail. In total definitely one of the nicer days on the trail. I hope you didn't fall asleep while reading this and again thanks for the support.das machine,"Leroy Smith shelter

What we had though was a small camp area actually turned out to be huge ! We quickly packed down our tents and headed into the New Jersey wilderness.

We had all though of New Jersey as a densely populated state, but we welcomed the beautiful forests and lakes, anything is better after Pennsylvania ! Within the first mile we came to a beautiful lake. The sun was coming up and the water was blue we just had to stop here for a moment. We couldn't stay long though or else we would be overrun by the thousands of Boy Scouts heading our way. We too a break about halfway at a fire tower and talked with some nice section hikers who warned us of the perils in New York. Apparently there are a lot of steps at some point.

I really never would have guessed New Jersey could be this nice, so far it is definitely my favorite state north of Virginia. About 9 miles in we saw our old friend from the smokies wazo, he had gotten off trail for five weeks and then started a flip flop so it was crazy to see him we caught up and reminisced on simpler times in the smokies. After that we hiked on and saw the obelisk shaped veterans monument. We then hiked on for 10 miles and made it to beautiful Unionville, N.Y. The people in the town were very pleasant, we actually only got honked at and flicked off once on the way into town. When we got there we picked up a box and went to the general store. We split a quart of ice cream and burnt sometime in town and then got moving. We've decided the best way to catch a ride out of town is to hang out at post offices.

Once we got going we soon wished we had stayed in bed. The terrain in NY is deceptively difficult. There aren't any long climbs but short concentrated uphill a that fry your legs. Sometimes it's less of a hike and even more of a rock scramble. It definitely makes the day interesting. Early on in the day we saw our first waterfall since VA and it was beautiful. We crossed a four lane highway and went into Harriman State Park. On our way in we passed a couple baby deer hiding in the bushes. The state park started out with a tough hill, but flattened out once we got on top. It turned into really cool open forest with big trees and not much undergrowth, so it ended up being a pleasant walk. We then got to what's known as the lemon squeezer. A small crack in two big rocks more narrow than a pack. So we actually had to hand out packs up and then climb up through the rocks. Needless to say David was pretty bummed about slack packing. When he got to the top though he saw a route to climb around the lemon squeezer and so he went back down, had us hand him his pack and he came back up again. At the top of the lemon squeezer we ran into some New Yorkers who gave us some food. After that David separated we didn't make it very far when we got to a near stagnate water source. Seam is filter less and prides himself on this fact. So in typical fashion he filled up his water bottle out of one of the most questionable water sources I have ever seen. As of the writing of this blog post he is not sick. We then proceeded to dawdle around, not accomplishing anything in any particular hurry.

They had out it on the point of bear mountain that was overlooking the Hudson River and the New York City skyline. When it got dark outside it was a truly amazing view. We woke up the next morning and headed to a campsite roughly 27 miles away. First, we had to climb up bear mountain ! This section was clearly well traveled because it was one of the best maintained trails I have ever seen ! They had put crushed gravel down on the trail and had friendly steps the whole way up ! We headed down into the town of bear mountain which was really small, basically just a post office. We picked up a package and hung out in the park in the park for a bit. A crazy squirrel almost stole all my lunch. After a nice break we headed into the bear mountain zoo (which the trail hoes through). We saw all kinds of birds and reptiles, David even saw a bear Haha!! At this point we had messed around in town for far too long. We still had 20 miles to hike and it was already 11.

We had a resupply box at an outfitter that didn't open till 10 so we had some time to kill in town. We went to a bakery and got carrot cake and a breakfast sandwich which was delicious. We then went and bought some groceries, and hung out outside the outfitter. We ran into orange crush, and just had a nice leisurely morning. Unfortunately, that translated into a hard day. We left Kent at 11 with the intention of doing 22 miles, but that quickly faded. Leaving Kent was very hilly and it was already so late. We made it through the first 6 and then had a nice flat 6 miles along the river, but after that Connecticut turned hostile. The final ten miles into camp where fairly unimposing on the map, but we quickly realized the deceit. We decided to just do 20 total and save ourselves some hiking. We made it into camp around 6, and pitched our tent for the second night in a row. Today didn't look to hard but I'm sure we will sleep like babies tonight.","mount agnos shelter

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535606,"Well we have spent the last few nights in our tent which is a nice change from the shelters. There is so much space for our stuff and Eli only snores a little.... With a good night of sleep we set off on our big day to reunite with David and Seam, who were going to wait 7 miles miles across the Connecticut border. We started walking earlier than usual so we could finish the 27 miles by a decent time. This was definitely the better half of Connecticut because the terrain was so much easier and the views were so much better ! Right before summoning bear mountain ( the tallest point in Connecticut) we ran into a thru hiker named Sparky ( we gave him the name) that we hadn't seen since our second night in Georgia! He had gotten off trail and decided to do sections of the trail from his house in Massachusetts. We never thought we would see him again, but we had a great time catching up and reminiscing of our time together so long ago. After reaching the top of the mountain we were greeted by many day hikers, so we headed down the steep downhill fairly quickly. Once we reached Sage's ravine we parallels a creek with some of the best swimming holes I have ever seen. The inviting water was SO cold, but we couldn't help ourselves but to go for a quick swim. Shortly after our swim we reached the Connecticut/Massachusetts border ! Our last big uphill of the day was up Everett mountain which was short but incredibly steep ( 700 feet in 0.7 miles). We made to the top and had a great view of our past mountain conquests. We headed down the hill to hemlock shelter where we met David. They had completed the Connecticut challenge the day before, but Seam had gotten unbearably sick, and gotten off trail at the first road crossing. We assume it is giardia because he hasn't been filtering his water lately. We are sad to leave him behind, but we are confident he will catch up with us. All in all not a bad day, and we are looking forward to getting into Tyringham, Massachusetts tomorrow !","Campsite- 5 miles before Falls Village

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535609,"Well the shelter roof leaked last night so I woke up with raindrops on my face. Luckily I was able to scoot over a few inches and go back to sleep. When we finally did wake up we knew it was going to be a day of low motivation. The rain had seemingly set in, and we were all fairly tired from the previous few days of hiking. Nevertheless, we headed down the trail ! A couple miles into the hike we were faced with a steep downhill on wet rocks. David lost his footing and fell hard on his side. We bandaged him up and decided we were going to stop short today for some much needed rest. After the huge descent we were in the low elevations of Massachusetts, and we were instantly swarmed by mosquitos. There were huge clouds of them around everyone's head. We got out our bug spray and applied it to every open inch of skin. It seemed to work pretty well thank goodness ! The rain rain stopped and the sun came out. I think I preferred the rain to the humid sweat we finished the day. To make matters worse I badly rolled my ankle a few miles before the road we were trying to get to. Thanks to Eli and David for carrying my pack the last few miles while I hobbled out. When we reached the road we almost immediately got a ride, which never happens for the 3 of us ( the trail gods must have known I was in pain). The kind man drove the 2 miles to east mountain retreat, where a nice woman lets hikers sleep in her basement for very cheap. We were the only ones there and it was nice to finally have a shower. Our 15 day streak without a shower was finally over. Thank goodness, you know it is bad when you can smell yourself all the time. The plan was to rest tonight and hopefully leave in the morning (depending on my ankle), but around 6 David became violently ill. I won't go into details because it was disgusting, but we will just say he wasn't doing well. We he doesn't think he drank any bad water along the way, so we are hoping it is just a 24 hour bug. It seems that we are all falling apart at once. Anyway, we have decided to zero here tomorrow in order to rest my ankle, and hopefully give David some time to rest up and feel, excited for our first zero in a while, although I wish it was under better circumstances.","hemlock shelter

It all started off pretty slow, we hung out and talked, David looked considerably better than last night and all was good. Around 10 we decided I should go into town since Zack and David were still recovering. So I emptied my backpack and headed off towards the road. I walked maybe 100 yards and got picked up (Great Barrington, MA is turning out to be very hitchhiker friendly) by a younger guy who had done a quarter of a thru hike two years ago. He was a nice dude and he drove me into town and waited on me when I went to the supermarket and McDonald's and then gave me a ride out. I even offered to pay him and he actually turned it down and gave me ten bucks! Needless to say it was some hard core trail magic. When I got back I realized I had left Davids guidebook in the city so I definitely owe him one. The rest of the day we hung out and recovered and made big plans for all the miles we were gonna do once we got back on trail. Around 4 captain jack sparrow rolled up to the hostel. He was pretty much the last person we expected to see but we're still pumped nonetheless. Around 4:30 he ordered pizza and the hype was real. Then around 5 it hit... I started to feel a little queasy and decided I wouldn't eat any pizza, by 7 I was projectile vomiting. I'm writing this blog post the day after because I was busy all night. Let's just say it was very unpleasant, uncomfortable, and we are gonna have to zero again.","east mountain retreat (Great Barrington, MA)

Unfortunately I was sick to the point where I couldn't touch any food but the clean clothes were nice. We are taking extra caution not to get Zack sick so anything dealing with me David helps with. To be honest I pretty much slept all day till 8 when the Penguins game started! We barely managed to say up, but it was well worth it to see the Penguins advance to the finals.

Luckily he was feeling good enough to walk and keep small pieces of bread in his stomach. We were able to catch a ride to the trail (Mass has been surprisingly good for hitchhiking). As we set off up the hill it felt good to be walking again after what seemed like such a long break ! About halfway up the hill Eli started to struggle. His stomach wasn't feeling good, but even worse he was so weak because he hadn't eaten or drank anything in over 24 hours. We knew we had to make it at least 5 miles to the next shelter, but the heat and the uphills were definitely going to make that difficult. David and I took turns carrying Eli's pack the remaining distance. I'm not sure how much easier that made it on the poor guy, but he was able to push through to the north Wilcox shelter. Once we arrived we played cards and rested for the whole afternoon. While we were there we met some really nice section hikers Nike and mayday (headed south) and Helen and Mary (aka: beacon and tag along). Special thanks to beacon and tag along for the extra food ! At the end of the night Eli still didn't eat anything, but we are hoping he will wake up and have his appetite back in the morning so we can have another short while he regains his strength.

I made it a couple miles before they caught me. After that it was around six miles into Upper Goose Pond Cabin we hiked the miles, and they went by fairly uneventfully, we got to goose pond around 2. We then had one of the best afternoons so far on the trail. Went for a swim in the beautiful pond, which is definitely more of a lake. We then took canoes out on the water and some people grilling out on their boat gave us hamburgers and drinks, it was a good time.

It was such a great way to start the morning !! After eating our full we headed back to the trail to continue north. Mid morning we reached the cookie lady's house. She is known for leaving cookies for hikers coming through. Unfortunately she wasn't there this morning, but we did fill up on water with her hose, it has been crazy hit the last few days. In the next stretch we saw a porcupine climbing up a tree. This was pretty cool considering we had never seen one before. After a few more miles the trail came right down into the streets of Dalton, MA. We stopped at a gas station in town for the customary Coke and ice cream. We finished off the last 8 miles into Cheshire with what seemed like all downhill, which was nice at the end of a long day! We rolled out our sleeping pads at the Catholic Church in town that was nice enough to let us stay for the night. It was great to not have to filter water or hang a bear bag tonight.

We didn't end up leaving the church until 8. The first 10 miles or so were uphill, the worst part was the heat humidity which had us drenched in sweat in minutes. After a struggle we made it to the top of Mount Greylock. There we were greeted by all the smart people who just drove to the top. The downhill section was steep and long when we got to the bottom we stopped and took a break. There I realized on the way down my pack frame had snapped. Luckily I could still hike with my pack, so I called an osprey rep and they told me an outfitter in Manchester Center VT would replace it. After that we had 7 miles net uphill to the Vermont border and then camp a mile past that. Unfortunately the climb up to the border was brutal. You know it's gonna be a tough climb when they have an alternate route for when it's wet and that was the case today. We summited and took a nice break and then finished out to the mile to the shelter. We got to the shelter and it was more full than even the shelters at springer. There were probably 30 people there. A mixture of long trail thru hikers and summer vacation. Either way it was pandemonium. We had to set up a tent, and Zack and I tried to sleep at our normal 8, but unfortunately the kids in the shelter were very loud. Eventually we nodded off though and all was good.","Cheshire, MA

When we got to the creek at the bottom David stopped and attempted to patch his air mattress which has been leaking for him recently. We headed onward and walked up a 10 mile hill. It isn't as bad as it sounds because it was very gradual most of the way up. When we made it to the top we stopped to get water, but we were instantly swarmed by black flies. We have been waned that the bugs are bad up here but this was the first instance where I actually wanted a bug net for my face.

This was a nice incentive because we would have a shower that night and only an 8 mile day over mount moosilauke the next day. We knew it was going to be long so we woke up early and got walking. This section is what most people call the gateway to the white mountains because you start to reach peaks that are over 4,000 feet with very steeps ascents. It is a good precursor for what is to come. Today we had 2 climbs that would tear our abilities. First was mount smart, a four mile climb. The worst thing about this mountain was that you could see the top of it the whole way up. It was discouraging to know how far we still had to go. The last part of the climb was what seemed to be straight uphill in a creek bed that had a lot of water in it. When we finally reached the top we ate lunch in the fire tower and enjoyed what we had accomplished. The sense of enjoyment didn't last long as we proceeded to hike straight downhill... It was a nice gradual downhill though, so it was very appreciated. When we reached the bottom we stood at the base of mount cube. At this point we were 17 miles into our hike with another 4 mile climb ahead of us, it was a daunting task. We slowly made our way up the rocky mountain. When we made it to the top we threw our packs off and rested for as long as we could. We had a nice view of mount smart across the valley. We felt good, but we knew our day wasn't over because we still had mount mist several miles down the trail. The only thing that got us over the last mountain was the thought of a bed and a shower at the hostel ! We rolled into the hostel around 8 and sat down for a long time.

It was pretty cold at the base of the mountain, but we figured it would warm up as the day went on. Also, we had heard there was only a 20% chance of rain today ! As we kept going it got colder, cold enough to put gloves on, But we still met a group of four people so it didn't seem to be too weird to hike in that weather and that was one of the reason why we didn't turn at least that's something I keep telling myself to not feel too dumb. We got above treeline and were met with strong winds ( approximately 80 mph with gusts of 100 mph). Visibility was maybe 20 feet, which made it hard to see the trail at points. To make matters worse we were being pelted by ice at hight speeds, it hurt really bad. I am not sure why we decided to keep going. Hindsight we should have turned around right there and waited for a better day to cross. When we finally arrived on Mount Lincoln we got into a safe spot and looked on the map to find out that it would be above treeline until we're done with Mount Lafayette and hike .3 miles down. So still a good bit to go and I started to get really cold. We started to hike as fast as we possibly could and as always Eli would keep getting ahead and stop every now and then. He waited on me on mt Lafayette again and instead of going down to the Hut 1.1 off the Trail we kept on going. at this time I started having problems with my sight and in general my coordination. while Eli went ahead again I fell several times (rainjacket has a small hole now). luckily i always fell in spots where it didn't had any consequences except for one 2 foot drop. i slipped in this normally technichal part. the next thing I remember is that I somehow land on my two feet. When we finally hit the treeline eli waited there and had his Backpack taken off. I just walked straight to him and said: I want to be home. At this point it was the only thought I had. get off this mountain and get home. Elis Equipment on the other Hand was still dry thanks to the dry sacks so we took the only option we had and cuddled up in one sleeping bag. if was a little tight but the only thing that actually could warm us up. After 1 hour Zach and Courtney showed up and luckily they were both fine. they had lost both pack covers and the map(except for zach's we got everything back later on(Trail provides)) Courtney couldn't feel the tips of her fingers anymore and everybody was cold but their stuff was still dry so we had that one going for us which was nice. So we cuddled up in the sleeping bags and just tried to warm up again. since it was relatively uncomfortable with 2 persons in one sleeping bag I tried to get out of it once to see if mine dried but there was no hope for that and I remember it as one of the coldest moments in my life. Zach came up big that day by getting the water(0.2 downhill doesn't sound like a long distance but trust me in our situation it was)cooking for Courtney eli and himself and basically doing everything outside of the sleeping bags because he was the only one with a dry daunjacket. This day taught me a lot and i'm thankful for the experience and even the day afterwards we started to answer the question if we would go up there again with yes just better prepared. 2 out of the 4 people we met up there that day had to get rescued.

We made it up our last climb of the day (south twin peak) around 4:30 and stopped to enjoy the overcast view. We made our way downhill to Zealand hut, where we were able to pick up some left over lunch scraps ! We found a beautiful stealth camping spot right down the trail that we just couldn't pass up. All in all not a bad day of hiking, the terrain out here is definitely as rugged as people say. Tomorrow we are walking the seemingly flat section to Crawford notch, where we will meet back up with Courtney and our friend Derek. From there we will hike to Mizpah hit and set up for our traverse over the presidential peaks. The weather today was not cold and rainy, but we luckily were not above treeline. We are really hoping it clears up soon so we can have good views and safely cross the presidential peaks !","white mountain lodge

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541604,"We left our campsite around 9 we had 6 miles to do in around 2 hours. We were meeting Derek and Courtney at 11 at Crawford notch. The first 6 miles were wonderfully flat. A nice change from the Rocky uneven terrain from earlier. We met Derek and Courtney right around 11, and then ate lunch. We only had six miles to Mizpah hut, but those miles contained a tough 3000 foot climb to Webster cliffs. The views along the climb were gorgeous, but the wind was brutal. We made it up the 3 mile climb in two hours. It was tough. We then hiked Mt. Webster and got into the hut around 4. There we found David scrubbing dishes for the hut for his work for stay. Luckily the hut only had four guests that night so they said all four of us could do work for stay. The huts are run by the Appalachian mountain club and are kind of like a backcountry hotel. They give hikers scraps and let them sleep on the floor if they do an hour or so of work. Usually it's pretty easy work like sweeping or doing dishes, and the food is very delicious, so it's totally worth it. That night we ate barbecue chicken and coffee cake. We were especially lucky they didn't force us to camp because it snowed all night long. Unfortunately if the weather doesn't get better we may have to go back down the mountain because the presidentials are all above treeline, and the snow and wind can be deadly up there.","campsite

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544797,"We woke up in the warmth of Mizpah hut, which was nice considering the snow that was falling outside. We were still undecided on what we would do today. Half of the group didn't have the gear to traverse the northern presidential peaks, but part of the group wanted to push on to get the miles. We decided that after our Franconia ridge experience it would be best to not push through the weather. Then we had to decide whether to stay at the hut or to retreat down the mountain to the safety of the valley. We decided to take the comfort of the valley. Luckily our friend Derek let us stay with him at crag mountain farm ( a nearby summer camp where he worked) we walked the 2 miles off the mountain and hitchhiked the way back to Derek's car. We immediately went to the grocery store and picked up the essentials for our grill out session that was about to take place. We ate too many burgers, showered, and washed our clothes ! It was a great day of relaxing with friends, and we owe a huge thank you to Derek and everyone at crag mountain farm for being so supportive and welcoming. The forecast for tomorrow is looking much better, so we are hoping to traverse the presidential range all in one day!","Mizpah Hut

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544798,"Today we left cragged mountain farm at 7, after a delicious breakfast prepared by Courtney. The drive to Pinkham notch went by quickly, and we found David waiting there at 8. We decided to try and traverse the presidentials today even though the weather wasn't going to be perfect. We said goodbye to Derek and then Courtney drove us to the trailhead. She dropped us off we said goodbye, and then headed up Crawford path. The first 4 miles below treeline weren't terrible m, but then we got to Mt. Clay and the wind really picked up. The visibility was reminiscent of Franconia ridge, but luckily we all were prepared and stayed much warmer. I wish I could tell you about all the beautiful views, but unfortunately all I could see was the barren rock right in front of me. We made it to lakes of the clouds hut around 1 (halfway through the traverse), when we got there we had no intention of staying, but we got to talking and realized that hiking was no fun at all in those conditions plus we wouldn't even get to see the supposedly most beautiful section of the trail. With promises of clear skies tomorrow we decided to do work for stay at Lakes of the clouds hut. The next three hours consisted of a lot of Yahtzee, and then some dish cleaning and then some more Yahtzee. We ate lasagna scraps and lemon poppyseed cake. I'm currently laying on the floor of the dining room totally content.","crag mountain farm

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544800,"We woke up to something amazing this morning, SUNSHINE! It seemed as though our patience had finally paid off and we might get a clear in the white mountains. I had morning work for stay chore of sweeping, which was good and bad. On one hand, we didn't get to leave the hit until 9 (fairly late start), but we got leftover breakfast scraps from the hut employees. Once outside we headed toward mount Washington (one of the most iconic peaks). The sun was finally out and we could see what all the hype was about ! We got to walk 6 miles above treeline, which is fairly uncommon on the AT. It was truly breathtaking, and very strenuous at the same time. These were definitely some of the most beautiful yet strenuous miles of the trip. We stopped at Madison hut and picked up some lunch scraps before our last presidential peak, Mt Madison. This peak in particular seemed like just a huge pile of boulders. There weren't any markers, but we knew we just had to make it to the top. Once on top we had a great view of all the peaks we had just climbed, it was an accomplishing feeling. We then started our descent into Pinkham notch, which in my mind, was harder than all the climbs put together due to the steepness. After the notch we had 6 more miles to carter notch ( our destination for the evening). It was 5 when we reached the notch, but we figured the remaining 6 miles could take no longer than 2 hours. We were very wrong because wildcat mountain is the steepest mountain on the AT. This plus our previous mileage made us extremely tired. We limped the remaining miles to carter notch hut in the dark. Luckily when we arrived the hut workers let us stay inside so we didn't have to pitch our tent ! We met our first sobo here. We are exhausted after this huge day over tough terrain, but we are also glad the weather has cleared up and we will be able to get back to hiking miles! Tomorrow will be our last day in the white mountain national forest and possibly New Hampshire !","Lakes of the clouds Hut

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544801,"We started the day off with a nice 6 am climb out of carter notch. Unfortunately, the trail was a classic white mountain affair, lots of steep uphills and slick rock downhills. The going was slow in the morning but we were rewarded with beautiful views back to the presidential range. After a steep descent down the carters we climbed back up to Mt Moriah. As we went back down towards Gorham we realized once again we would be passing by white mountain hostel. We decided to cut our day a few miles short and stop at the hostel. We promised it would be our last hostel, and a nice way to celebrate making it out of the whites. I personally had ulterior motives. I have trouble saying no to a good breakfast. That night I stuffed my face with food and watched tv in preparation for the next two weeks in Maine.","carter notch hut

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544804,"The white mountain hostel is so great ! It is definitely my favorite place we have stayed ! After a great night of sleep and a large breakfast we are ready to take on the trail ! We left the hostel around 8 with big plans to make it to full goose shelter to meet our trail friend mad dog. We had thought the terrain would be easier since we were out of the whites, but we were shocked to find   extremely tough climbs. At the top of mount success we finally crossed over into Maine ! It seemed like we were so close to the end even though there was still over 200 miles. The 2 week countdown to Katahdin was on ! We made it up our last climb of the day (full goose mountain) as the sun was getting low. From the top of the exposed ridge you could see forever with no town in sight, just mountains. We are all so excited to see what the rest of Maine has to offer ! At the base of the mountain we came to a large swampy meadow. Eli walked right off the bridge and ended up knee deep in the mud, so much for his shower and freshly washed clothes. We made it into camp and grabbed a shelter spot next to our buddy mad dog, who plans on hiking with us the rest of the time ! We have an early morning planned to get into town before the post office closes.","white mountain hostel

Sonic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544805,"Yesterday we realized I made a huge logistical error, I shipped my shoes to the post office in Andover, ME, where we would be on a Sunday. So after a series of mountain top phone calls we were able to arrange for a ride to the post office from an earlier gap. The gap was still 10 miles away and we had to be there by 10. This wouldn't be too hard at our usual pace, but this ten mile section of trail is home to mahoosuc notch and arm. The notch is the most infamous section of trail on the AT. A collection of van sized boulders jumbled together in a narrow notch. I assume this section of trail would be appealing to any rock climber but with a cumbersome 30 pound pack things can get interesting. Once you make it through the labyrinth it's on to mahoosuc arm which has a reputation in the shelter logs as a definite day ruiner. With all that in mind we left full goose pond shelter at 4. We hiked around a mile and dropped into the notch. Our goal was to make it through in an hour. The trail wove around, on top, and under boulders. Often times you could see ice deep in crevasses of Boulder piles. Whoever maintained the section of trail had a sick sense of humor. Often times the trail intentionally went under boulders just because it could. Several times we had to army crawl through sections. When it was all said and done we finished in an hour. The next 8 miles to the gap went by fairly quickly. We were treated to more classic Maine. That's been my favorite thing about Maine so far is that you can look into any direction and just see trees, lakes, and mountains. It's absolute wilderness. Andover is a tiny town with a post office and a gas station. All went smoothly with the pick up and we got back to the trailhead around 12. One beautiful thing about the north is that no matter where you are they always carry Ben and Jerry's ice cream, even in the Andover gas station. After we got dropped off we hiked a quarter mile and stumbled upon a trail magic cooler chocked full of goodies, such as snickers, Gatorade, and beer. The snickers and Gatorade were a great way to wash down the Ben and Jerry's. After that we hiked up bald plate mountain, and called home. We then hiked 8 more miles and camped at surplus pond.","full goose shelter
