Verge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524726,"I'm a little late to the journaling party, but here we go, day four. I woke up refreshed but groggy after a long day of hauling ass up a tiny mountain here, a cute hill there, up Blood Mountain, and down to Neels Gap where I found some extra energy to dance when I learned I could shower there. Eleven dusty miles and a thunderstorm later, here I am at Low Gap huddled in a cozy tent with my beloved Looney sister making a trail journal and laughing at some very flattering pictures she took of me. I have blisters all over my toes and think I may get wet tonight, but I am very happy.","Neels Gap

You'd think I'd be able to get a second in the middle of nowhere haha.","Dick's Creek

Verge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537968,"Walked out of Harper's Ferry today, the unofficial halfway. I thought that I would feel blown away when I got there, by relief or maybe accomplishment, but I guess I'm just surprised that so much time has passed. It really whizzes by out here sometimes, like the flat miles. Today, Legs and I left Knight's Inn intending to walk a mile down the road in ninety degree heat to the trailhead, and that's how it began, but Legs belatedly stuck out a halfhearted thumb at the first car that passed and the car actually came back for us. It's crazy, but that's the first time we've ever tried to hitch because we have been so lucky with kind strangers offering us rides. Two funny veterans, Lassie and Outback, who call us The Kansas Killers, apparently on account of how our charm and country girl naivety is suspicious and probably deadly, are going to give us so much shit for that. They like to complain about how much harder it is for guys to find rides - which is totally true. Anyway, it was gorgeous today with a lot of hot wind, and Legs and I made it to this fancy campground by seven to eat a pasta side and drink absurd amounts of water, some flavored with interesting tea from the Inn whose awesome manager we had fun chatting with this morning. There's always so much more to say, which I think is one reason I never start a post, but I'm thankful I could write a tiny bit before having to pee for the hundredth time today as I really found a way to drink that much after a couple days of dehydration and a special warning from Smiley (who seems to know everything about the trail) about a lack of springs ahead. Got to go, love y'all.","

Verge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541543,"This morning I was cold! After weeks of being way too hot I just wasn't expecting a chilly day. It was a welcome change. I hiked thirteen miles to a highway where a nice lady picked me up as I was busy looking pathetic roadwalking through the cold drizzle. She was very sweet and even offered me reading material as I exited at my destination of choice, Annie Bananie's (the outfitter and ice cream). I saw that it was a Jehovah's Witness magazine thing when I got out hehe. I picked up the drop box sent by my amazingly helpful grandparents at the outfitters then met up with Sweets, Jingle, and Training Wheels at a coffee shop. Legs and I had the best dinner we ever had at the cheese shop next door (I can't wait to try and replicate it), and then had the best dessert ever at Annie's as we watched the Red Sox and chatted with the ice cream guy, and then had the best night hike ever walking through the lush silent forest filled with enchanting firefly lights. We got to the tent site and set up just before it really started to rain again.","
