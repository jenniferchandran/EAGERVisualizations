Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518877,"Helluva day. I've been thinking about it for a couple of months now. Getting back on the trail in 2016. Finished it in 2006, left the trail at Damascus in 2015, decided to hit it again in 2016.It's so easy to sit here in my comfortable chair and talk about hiking. Far more difficult to write about it when the weather doesn't show any signs of a respite, and all your gear is wet. Fact is, it's hard out there, not to mention the sore feet, and sometimes less than optimal tent space. I guess I'm really trying to be focused on why we do this rather than to just brush off the hardships, while they are not the focus of the day. Had a heart to heart chat with my greatest supporter last night as we dined in one of our favorite restaurants. She gave me the green light, so here we are. Planning another thru hike. The difficulties I had on the trail last year are still fresh. Maybe that will be a blessing.",,Kicking off another hike,"Dec 31, Thu",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518908,"Two days ago, it was only a nagging question in my mind. Suddenly we're looking at travel options, and checking the gear for what needs replacement. Not much really, but there is some. That Big Agnes Q-Core ultra narrow, ultra noisy, minimal sleep pad may get donated somewhere. I'll try something else, but the sad truth is I'll probably never be completely satisfied until they allow llama's on the trail.    Actually, llama's would be a great benefit to the trail. We could burn their dung at our campfires and all sorts of other trail friendly things. I'm sure the white mountains would be a hoot with a llama.    Sadly, I'll have to leave my comfortable 3.5 inch, 5 lb REI sleep mat behind. However, I did find another pair of the Keen 'Durand' boots that I bought in Gatlinburg last year. I'll break them in put them aside. Away from the llama pen of course.",,Things Happening Fast,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518934,"Well OK, with 2015 still somewhat fresh, I decided to make some gear changes. First of all, because gear changes are kind of a constant in my world, and second, because it's the right thing to do in most circumstances.    Flashlight: Last year I packed a photon LED light that weight 15 grams. Great little flashlight, single bulb, ""nano"" caliber light weight and very durable. Then there was the pre-dawn climb up to Clingman's Dome. Simply put; not enough light to hike by. Fall-back...the same small headlamp I carried in 2006. Still works great. A few grams heavier, but weight takes a back seat to functionality.    Water Bladder: Last year I bought a Camelbak with a winterized hose with the thought of avoiding the tube freeze in the early days. So OK, the mouth piece froze. This year I begin in GA with two 1 quart Gatorade bottles.    Rain Gear: Last year I started with my REI parka. An excellent Gore-Tex jacket that was somewhat heavy, but did a great job of keeping me dry; up until the all day cold rain just before Hot Springs, NC. OK, so it was old, but I really never expected it to fail. Fall-back a replacement for my tried and true Marmot Pre-cip. If I'm gonna get wet, might as well do it with a light weight jacket.    More Advil. Great replacement for those tan colored M&M's in your gorp. But seriously, a far more attentive posture on pain mitigation. For me that's a serious issue. Foot pain is probably my number one struggle, so I keep the boots I discovered last year, and buy a new pair to break in in the coming days.",,Gear Changes,"Jan 02, Sat",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519186,"As a writer, not someone with a huge following, but someone who enjoys describing the day in words, I've been kicking around an idea that came to me one night in '15. Finding the music in each day, whether it be owls hooting in the trees at night, or the wind whipping through the trees during a storm.I'm having difficulty finding a song for the image included in this post, but the sunrise that accompanied it, I assure you, was worthy of something special. After days of uncertain or just plain fowl weather, we emerged from Peck's Corner shelter near the northern exit of the Smokies to this breathtaking sunrise. Writing about the day can be a kind of therapy for tired bones. The point is to find something more than tediousness in the path of the day. It is only fitting that one with a trail name like Conductor (music reference) might try and find a bit of music in it all. Help is always appreciated, so if you can think of a music theme you would like to read about describing the AT, send it on and I'll fit it in. Somewhere along the trail.",,Balancing a Theme,"Jan 06, Wed",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519630,"It is so easy to over plan a thru hike, while waiting those last few weeks. That's probably what I'm doing, but I can't help but look at those 16 ounces of stove and wonder if it's really necessary. On the trail, I do without coffee and a hot breakfast or lunch, leaving only the evening meal to cook. And what a fascinating evening meal it is! Instant mashed potatoes or maybe a pot full of noodles. Yum Is the hot meal necessary? Actually no. It takes half a water bottle, is basically pure carbohydrate and the heat does nothing really because it has to be cool enough to actually eat. What's left? Variety? Nope. So I've played around with an idea to quantify the value of carrying a stove. I went to the grocery and purchased a variety of trail foods. Certainly not a complete list... OK by a long shot not a complete list. Still, it represents a sample of what I tend to carry on the trail. Now, realize that for this hiker the trail is any distance between cheeseburgers. So I bought these samples and laid out a spreadsheet to quantify things like caloric density (calories per grams of carrying weight including packaging.)I also factored in three nutrients that I like to target in foods, which are protein, fiber and omega-3; giving each a weight factor based on my completely unscientific guess. Actually the factors didn't move the needle much. I could have left them out, since weight dominates the need. Let's face it. Food is heavy and we cannot carry enough to compensate to the calories we burn.As it turns out, the typical cooked fare turned out to be lower in value than most trail foods. Poptarts, by the way, come in the same bracket, so they're a toss as well. As for the meats, the poorest caloric density registered, but I don't need to cook them. So I decided to put the stove in the bounce box and test the idea of a stove-less hike in real time. As an added benefit, I can add flavor and electrolytes to my water bottles. Darn I'm gonna miss those Poptarts.",,A Hard Look at the Stove,"Jan 14, Thu",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519771,"The pile is out of the picture frame. It's large and contains many antiques, like a ceramic ""Katahdin"" water filter that weighs about 2 pounds. 25 years ago it was the ""one to have.""So for my non-thru-hiking reader friends, a winter gear layout without the pack. Current weight reading about 15.25 pounds basic (sans food and water.) Food will weigh more this year partly because of the stove-less plan and partly because I'm taking a focused approach to nutrition and calorie burn. Multi Vitamins and glucosamine (horse pills) figure into that food weight, but actually more food this year to meet a minimum calorie goal. A calorie deficit still unavoidably exists.Some of this stuff comes out of the pack at varying intervals. The Yaktrax disappear after the Smokies, but the thermals may linger into Virginia. Calculated summer weight is 12.6 pounds, but it's only an estimate. There is no cutoff moment that says, OK ship the winter gear home. Some of it may go in the bounce box and bounce back into the pack up north.Everything that needs to stay dry goes in the stuff sacks. Pack covers simply don't work. Some stuff gets double protection with waterproof bags plus the stuff sacks. All the nasty little electronics needed to support an iPhone. I'm thrilled about that :/ but at least it fits in a bag. Will it change? um... will the weather? With over a month before start, it will surely evolve. More than likely there will be additions rather than reductions.",,Gear Combing,"Jan 17, Sun",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520821,"First test this year of the iPhone and Camera setup along with a complete pack load out. Everything went well except the windchill zapped my camera battery in a hurry. I found this great little devise that along with the Apple IOS 9.2 version allows upload to the phone from an SD card. Now, most of my friends know I'm sort of a camera snob and the truth as I see it... Phone cameras are good for selfies and little else. Last year I was distraught by my inability to get my camera photos into my journal. The iPhone pictures just don't cut it. I will accept that the case was a large factor. It's difficult to keep a lens clean; but I digress.With the new gizmo, the camera gets to stay and I am the happy camper. You, dear reader will get to see better images of the AT. It's a win all around. Speaking of win, today is the SuperBowl. So what. So, with a month left before hitting the trail, I put a full pack together to include food and water for a hike with some friends. Pack on, pack off scale difference figured out to 21 pounds, which I am very satisfied with. Only 4 days of food, but that is my typical supply. Actually I was very comfortable all day even on the climbs. Of course, the hills of Michigan don't even begin to compare with the mountains of the AT, but it was a good test.Body shakedown went well. Doctor says I am unlikely to die of natural causes anytime within the next six months. He gave me a great tip on an alternative to ibuprofen. When I asked specifically about pain mitigation he suggested Turmeric. An alternative medicine recommended by a physician? Worth a try.",,Shake it all Down,"Feb 07, Sun",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521720,"As I sit in my comfortable chair, passing the time before starting the trail, a lot of things go through my head. At the foremost is mental preparedness. One of the things I do for that is read other people's journals. I especially like the one's where the hikers tell it like it is and don't paint some rosy picture of every day. Sure there are a lot of great days out there, a lot of em. That's why we hike, for the views, and the people and the incredible journey ahead. But anyone who really knows the trail knows that there are days when a hiker gets down.Many ""in the know"" people say that the trail is 90% mental and I agree. To be sure it's also very physical. Still, I'm taking a realistic look at how to hike the mental hike. It's just like finding the right equipment, and who would agree on that? For me, it's anticipating those moments and having something prepared for it.OK, enough of the heavy shit. Still haven't settled my gear and figure I'll just have to figure it out along the way. Added some cold weather stuff, decided to go with a pad inflation bag instead of using moist breath in hopes of extending the life of my pad. Tested out some food options. Geez, these last two weeks will just drag by.",,Two Weeks Before Start,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521879,"We had a great snow covering yesterday, so I got out and did some snowshoeing today. Yesterday I dug out of my driveway. The snow blower couldn't handle it, so it all had to be done by shovel. Good aerobic workout.Thing is, training for the AT in lower Michigan is like training for a boxing match with no sparing partner. You can build up endurance and develop a pretty good punch, but the punching bag doesn't punch back. Not to suggest I know anything about sports, especially boxing. I do know this, the AT punches back. Think Sassafras mountain.  We don't have any mountains here in the lower peninsula. I'm told there are some in the upper, but I haven't hiked them.Hey, I wanted to give a shout out to some of my hiking friends from last year who I hope to see on the trail this year. Papa-Al, Philco, Sookie and Spirit. Possibly Paisley, if she doesn't start too late. People are one of the many aspects of the AT that make it special. Looking forward to meeting a lot of new folks along the way.",,Press On,"Feb 26, Fri",0
Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522238,"Ready as I will ever be, except for mailing the bounce box. At this point, it's pretty much going over things and trying to make sure all of the loose ends are taken care of.I've got the map embedding worked out, and will probably do that on a ""milestone"" basis rather than each journal entry. Beth will update part of it from home, with data sent from me on the trail. Pretty neat method of embedding a Google map with a current position into the journal entry. To see an example, check out Airlock's Journal from 2015.Still going strong on the stove-less experiment. This will go until I get my bounce box in Fontana, where the final decision will be made. The evening meal I have put together has more calories and better nutrition than a package of noodles, so I'm pretty happy with it. At least for now. Built in variety too. Basically crackers meat and cheese.So today, I plan to get an accurate pack weight and take one last hard look at everything in it.

Shuttled up to Springer parking lot from Hiker Hostel, did the one mile Southbound to the summit and started North at 10:00. Temperatures in the high 60s, maybe higher. The overcast sky eventually gave way to clear blue. Pretty good way to start a hike.Staying at the new tenting camp half a mile short off Hawk Mountain. 30 new tenting sites, plus a brand new privy and a spring quite a way back. Oh yes, bear boxes instead of cables. Some folks did a great deal of work on this site.Have met some people. Seems like we have a pretty good bunch. Not what I would call crowded. At least tonight. Maybe 10 of the 30 occupied.Can't say much about my stove less experiment. Had cheese, salmon and wheat thins, but really not much of an appetite today.","Springer Mountain

Always good to hear the woods come alive.So I started out about 7 this morning and hiked in a cloud for most of the day. It cleared up later in the day, but even at my slow pace I was in camp shortly after the sun came out. It actually made for a pretty good day of hiking.Today was more difficult than yesterday. Mostly because of a couple climbs, but more because the trail is a little more rocky. A couple of streams to rock hop and maybe just a little bit farther, but it was still a great day for hiking.A lot of people here tonight. Maybe 40 or so. I've met a lot of them, but most don't have trail names, so it's still very early in that process. Fun to help them with suggestions. The German couple from Hamburg were suggested as Hamburger and French Fries, but we'll see. Not my suggestion, but I did suggest to one girl who stills quietly in the corner that we should call her ChurchMouse. Don't think she will use it though.","Hawk Mountain Campsites

It rained a little during the night, but today was another warm sunny day.It was good hiking, maybe a little warm. I drank two liters of water and ran out just before Lance creek. Plenty of water available, so no reason to ration. Still can't eat the full daily food ration though. I'm sure that will change, but tomorrow I have a box I mailed to the outfitter at Neels gap. Now I will have even more to carry. Rats.Some are saying the rain will come tomorrow. One thing is certain. It will come eventually.

Rolled in at 11 and snagged the last one. Sharing with Jelle from The Netherlands and a couple, Phillip and Jill. One of the differences this year is that hardly anyone has trail names yet. People are making suggestions, but nobody is finding their calling. Just different, that's all.Four beautiful days in a row. It's kind of amazing. According to the AT weather website the rain is coming in tonight and will last through tomorrow. Still the temps are nice in the mid sixties.Blood mountain was a nice hike. Lots of day hikers out enjoying the weather. My early start found me hiking in the dark for the first hour. Not something I do often, but it was nice to watch the sunrise and listen to the birds. I was alone until I got to the summit. It's great to walk alone in the woods once in a while.","Lance Creek

I decided to take a zero day and my body is appreciative. I feel pretty good, but the four day trek to get here can be felt in my muscles.Sitting here in the Blood mountain cabins lodge enjoying the atmosphere and chatting with other hikers. We are all still in those early stages of acquaintance, some have dropped out. That normal at this stage and I won't put a number on it cause I don't really know, but a significant percentage of thru hikers drop by this point. Yet the early excitement of the trail can still be seen in many.At this point in the journey, we all look forward to putting miles behind us.

Except for a couple of mountains, oh yes there are always those, it was an uneventful day. On and off drizzle and I finally broke out my rain jacket. Of course the rain quit then. A small tent city has grown up around me in the two hours since I set up my tent. It's just before 5:00 and we heard thunder in the distance. This makes the third time I have camped at Low and it has been raining every time, so I'm not counting on a dry night. I'm dry in my tent and that's what counts.What's for dinner? A nice sharp cheddar with wheat thins and herb and garlic tuna in a tortilla. I'll hang the food bag just before dark so I can munch away at all this food I brought. I planned for only 2500 calories per day, but I don't has the appetite to go through it all right now.

Not for me, since we have only been out of Neels gap for 1 day.I will go into Hiawassee in two days. Another short day tomorrow then a longer one before the hostel.With the good weather, several of us sat in a big circle and just let the conversation flow.

Sorry the picture isn't very good, but if you look bottom center you can see his head. His tail is near the top of the image.Couple of pretty good climbs today, but nothing too strenuous. Tray Mountain was a 1500 footer and I think that might be the biggest one yet. Nice views because once again we had amazing weather for hiking. It was sunny but breezy today.Actually last night the winds were gusty enough to cause my tent to flap noisily and keep me awake. I should sleep better tonight. Hope so cause I want to get an early start and get to the hostel in time to make a supply run to town. Think I' ready for that cheeseburger. From our campsite, the city lights can be seen scattered throughout the valley far below us, while not obscuring the stars. I just crawled out of my tent and enjoyed the peaceful scene for a moment.

Not a particularly eventful day. I did see a whitetail deer. And it was another perfect hiking day. Cool breeze, blue sky, wind in hair... That sort of thing. Like as I was road walking the .5 mile to the hostel the wind blew my hat from my head over the side of the drop off. Well, I wasn't gonna climb down that bank for just a hat; so I threw a couple bucks down the bank and proceeded to recover my stuff.Happy St Patty's day. Supposed to be a big start date for the AT. Glad I'm a few days ahead of that because the hostel is at full capacity tonight. Five of our group is tenting due to overflow. Joker and I called in from Tray mountain last night. Pretty sure we got the last two bunks. Towns are where the hiker bubbles collect, break apart and form new bubbles, so we have a mix of new and old faces here.

We were in the ""Wolf Den"" room, where they allow hikers with dogs to stay. There was this woman with a service dog. Not really sure why she needs a service dog except for not being all there. Now this may seem insensitive so skip to the next paragraph if people with disabilities can do no wrong in your paradigm. This lady cleared her throat loudly three times every minute. I do not exaggerate. Now OK, I can tolerate that for quite a while, quite a while. Now let's try for two hours straight, while she continues to rustle around in her pack until 11 PM. I'm not making this up. Of course she used her bright white headlamp after lights out (house rules) at 10.She seems very nice, just somewhat oblivious. I'll try and cut her some slack. And maybe snooze a while today. Yeah, I'm writing a journal entry in the AM. Bass akwards from my routine, but things are upside down today. A leisurely trip into town for resupply and another cheeseburger.Update on the trail names. Most of the hikers have chosen and I think we have a good collection. Jelle from The Netherlands speaks English so well he actually cracks jokes and even an occasional pun. He was the last to take on a trail name, but Joker just fits him perfectly. Super nice young man. We also have Spoony and Whistler, two young Jewish kids from Manhattan and a young couple from PA; Voodoo and Caboose. There are others, who I will fold in during the coming weeks.So the first resupply went well. Ingles supermarket with all the good stuff. All except that is for single spam servings  gotta eat just tuna for three nights. Tomorrow I'll start a three and a half day trek to Franklin NC. Pushing on toward Fontana in about 10 days or so.

It was 8:20 when I reached the gap. As I stepped out of the woods a van pulled up an Ron himself stepped out and asked if I was headed to town. He had just stopped by on his way in. He no longer owns the Sapphire Inn, but he has created a hostel right across from the Budget Inn, which he owns. So, as I enter my hobbit sized private accommodation I see Ron loading up the shuttle with hikers for the run up to Winding Stair Gap.

Great views, but with a long way to go I didn't linger. No cheeseburger today, but there was some great trail magic at Stecoah gap, which offered a great break right before the wickedest climb of the day. A ham and cheese sandwich and a can of soda really hit the spot. Now, ya know when a hill has a name it's not going to be easy. Jacobs ladder is only 600 feet, but it is very steep and after yesterday's long climb I'm pretty tired. So lots of steep ups and downs today. Tomorrow is a shorter day as we arrive in Fontana. I'll be sharing a room at the lodge with a hiker I recently met named NesQuick. It will be five days since a shower, so that's gonna be nice.I'm in good spirits and I feel pretty good.

Of course in my own dopey way, I made it more complex by sending the bounce box to the lodge. I had forgotten my decision to do that, which lead me dowwwwnnn to the Post Office only to discover my box was not there. Fortunately the gaiters Beth had ordered from REI were there, so the trip was not wasted. So baaaccckk uuuup to the lodge, to see if I sent it there. Yep. Was here all along.Still, the zero feels good and I am ready for the six night trek across the park, where we are required to sleep in the shelters, unless there is no space. With luck I will have a couple of those nights in my tent, but the trail doesn't seem all that crowded.Zero days early in the hike help a lot with tissue recovery. Relaxing, drinking and eating healthy food like salads and generally letting our bodies rest. It's a good thing. At least that is what we tell ourselves, when inside we feel the urge to put more miles behind us Depending on the service availability this may be the last post for a few days. The weather ahead looks good for the most part, but we do expect one or two days of storms. Should drop out of the Smokies next Monday. Looking forward to dropping out of the high country and seeing those trilliums in Davenport gap.
Later in the day, Tall One and his wife Brenda invited NesQuick and I to dinner in Bryson City, and we all enjoyed a drive through the mountains and a fantastic dinner at Jimmy Mac's restaurant.

Standing Bear Farm is a classic hostel. Great place to relax after the somewhat stressful traverse of the Smokies. I got in at about 11:30 after the long descent from the high country. It is sunny and warm here. And the trees are in bloom.

I have not taken any ibuprofen at all, nor naproxen. A couple of Tylenol, six in all. Facebook time at the library, coffee shop chillin with trail friends, what a great trail town.

It works out well to start late and plan to arrive in the next camp about 5 PM. Most of the people leave out early, so I snooze in my tent until it quiets down. I'm not sure if I am just in a hiker bubble, or if there are just a lot of people hiking this year. It's not bad though. I just make reservations about four days in advance, sometimes more depending on phone signal.It's a mixture of people I have hiked with for weeks and some only days. A constantly evolving group.

It is, at once, familiar, yet constantly changing. After leaving Overmountain shelter we crossed over the last balds of the Roan highlands. Absolutely breathtaking scenery. The trail lies exposed as a ribbon across the folds of the treeless balds. Similar topography as most of the trail thus far, but the lack of trees allows a perspective of the ups and downs that's hidden by the forest.Looking forward to what is considered the best breakfast on the trail tomorrow morning. After a hot shower, I'm just chilling out on the deck at the hostel. An easy day tomorrow followed by some long days moving closer to VA until I'm in a position to Nero into town.Might be some fowl weather ahead in the coming week. That'll be a game changer. Half of me is looking forward to it. Not really sure how to express that. Maybe it's a nagging concern that the dry weather will eventually give us dry springs, which are our main source of water on the trail.

Well, I had overlooked this hostel, but in hindsight it breaks the days into two medium length days instead of a short and a long, so here I am. At least it's a cheap hostel.The real issue is the wildfire that stands between us and the resupply hostels at Dennis Cove road. Several hikers were held up today due to the fire. Hopefully it's under control by tomorrow.Easy trail today. Should be easier tomorrow, now that I trimmed the milage. Ok, more about that breakfast. Becha thought I was just gonna gloss over that. A vast smorgasbord encompassing fruit, meats, pastries, classic biscuits and gravy, caramel glazed monkey bread and, of course , eggs. The word is that they are being officially recognized.

The fire had spread beyond the rejoin point. Soooo, as I write ten hikers are on hold near the rejoin point awaiting another reroute.Well, the reroute was extended an additional six miles. The milage for the trail today as recorded is the official AT milage, but we walked a little farther than that and were picked up by the proprietor of Black Bear resort, saving us an additional, and brutal seven mile road walk.So I'm staying in a four person cabin with Squid, Tumbleweed and Escargot, which turns out to be cheaper than the bunkhouse.So we had planes and helicopters buzzing around. Sometimes a whiff of smoke. There were forest rangers, who by the way made every attempt to help us navigate the reroute. They also contacted the hostel and arranged the shuttle.

What a magnificent piece of living art, this Appalachian Trail. Millions of hours of difficult human labor have created something very special. The road, by contrast, made with machinery was dull, almost boring. No pictures can do this section justice.As we made the 1300 foot climb to pond flats a thunderstorm rolled in on us. Tumbleweed and I sat under a rhododendron, which at least slowed the rain down before it hit us. Once we were sure there wasn't going to be lightning, we moved on. It rained for about two more hours then subsided. At the recreation area, just across US 321 a couple was doing trail magic of homemade vegetable soup, fried plantains and cake. Just the thing for soaking wet hikers. Luckily they were doing it under a picnic shelter roof. Really a nice treat on a wet day.The hike continued through the Watauga lake bear closure area, where some bear incidents have been occurring for a few years, thus the long day.As I arrived at the shelter, I found Sookie and Spirit (2015) hikers among the dozen or so people here.

On the trail for a nice day with a threat of thunderstorms later in the day. Beautiful trail. The forest is coming alive after the winter hibernation. Tiny deciduous trees line the trail. Everything is the new green of emerging flora. At one point I captured this image of an oak, a maple and a beech sapling one the forest floor. As I was dropping down to the valley near the Lindamood school house. A fellow met me on the trail and holding out his hand introduced himself as Rick Lindamood, great grandson of the teacher who once taught in this one room schoolhouse. Rick and his family were there in the historically restored schoolhouse doing trail magic. Squid, Dirty Deeds, Buckles and myself enjoyed a leisurely break, while enjoying cold sodas. I also got a new toothbrush from their trail magic supplies. The kindness of people on the trail makes the AT what it is. An upwelling of human kindness has grown with each annual group of hikers that pass through. The Lindamood school, brings to life the stories my parents. Drying socks near the wood stove in the center of the room. One small room with students at many levels crowded into the wooded bench desks. Lot a history on this trail. Lot of evidence that American life has come and gone here. Evidence of the native Americans would be more difficult to find.By the time we got to Atkins the storms had us bracketed. Since we were near I-85 my phone had a good signal, so I checked my radar app. Yep, bracketed by some serious weather. I've actually never seen the violet color inside the storm cells before. Until today that is. When Buckles and Dirty Deeds asked Squid and to share a room at the local motel it really wasn't a difficult decision. All in all it was a pretty successful day.

We are camping about a half mile from the knob so we got into camp early after lingering at the knob for a long lunch.Well the short days are because the crowding due to graduation ceremonies near Daleville plus the next shelter is closed due to bear activity. Tomorrow we will rise early and hike into Daleville in the early afternoon.A couple of us saw a fox today near the campsite. It was nice to get in early because we got the flattest tent spots. Tomorrow, being a town day, we'll get up early and hopefully have plenty of time after the 15 miles to do town chores. After Daleville, I will have a two week stretch without a town day.

A three thousand foot climb over Bald Knob. Some parts were very steep and we would already have hiked eleven miles. At least the clouds burnt off a little and we did get some beautiful views from the grassy knob. Not actually a bald according to the guide book.There was talk of a hostel. Talk of more rain. I didn't even know this hostel was here, but that's the difficulty of having a guidebook with so much information and trying to plan more than a week in advance. Easy to miss the reference that points to another page that lists several services in the area. Easy to miss a new hostel. Awesome place. Only six bunks. Really a comfortable house nestled a clearing in the hills. And they serve breakfast!So it turns out, I get to charge the phone once again, wash the few clothes I have and take a shower a lot sooner than expected, but most welcome.

They were 50 yards ahead of me. I started smacking the tips of my poles on the rocks and soon enough, momma bear's head pops up. Whew, same side of the trail as the cubs. She moved themhh away. I gave her a little time. Another bear later in the day decided to go south on the AT. I thought he might be crazy, since most southbounders are, so I clacked my poles over my head and barked at him. He looked at me like I was the crazy one and headed for the woods.I did stop at the wayside store today and had a cheeseburger and fries, washed down with forty ounces of gator aid. That in addition to the four liters of water. It was a hot day. Then in the afternoon a small rain cloud passed overhead. I didn't even put my jacket on. The rain felt good on my bare arms and on my head. So then, with five miles to go I left Elk Wallow wayside. Minding my business, watching the trail for rocks and snakes. SNAKES! Halt! Snake! There sunning himself was a small rattler. About eighteen inches long. What then proceeded was a standoff. Both sides of the trail were briars. The snake made no effort to move away in spite of the pebbles I tossed at him. Eventually I had to move him off with one of my trekking poles. Not my first choice, since it was a hot day and he had been sunning himself. In spite of my harassment, he never once rattled. Wierd.The hut, unlike last night is very very crowded.

With a bunk (separate bunk rooms for men and women) comes fitted and flat sheets, pillow case and a towel. Really a beautiful place.

About every half hour (not exaggerating) we got to guess what kind of train was coming, which way it was coming from and how long it would be. Can't say I recommend the backpacker's campsite outside of Boiling Springs.The town was nice though. I went to the coffee shop and was invited to sit with some local men who all turned out to be veterans. We chatted about the trail and the typical questions folks have about thru hiking then on to other subjects for about an hour. The people of the town were friendly, so it was a nice morning. A fellow stopped me on my way to the cafe and suggested I try the baked oatmeal. Now... How many towns will a stranger stop you on the street and suggest trying the oatmeal ??  Why yes, yes I did.Trail magic today! Dragonfly, the oldest female to ever through hike the AT was doing trail magic with her son Peter. Hotdogs, lemonaid and strawberry shortcake. Yum!Most of the hike today was flat. We crossed the Cumberland valley through pastures and fields. Actually a nice change of scenery, but the humid conditions have returned. And, of course, the last mile was a steep 500 feet to the top of a ridge that we could see twenty miles away. Here we are at the top of the ridge. Nice shelter with beautiful flat camping spots. The ""sporadic"" spring is flowing and cold. Life is good Into Duncannon tomorrow. Last of the famous trail towns for a while. Looking forward to a second shower this week! Then maybe a cheeseburger.

The hike was easy, as PA tends to be. Some rocks, more than a few, but nothing serious. I made good time. The wind was really whipping the trees around today. Couldn't really hear anything but the trees.It occurs to me that I listen to the woods quite a bit. Things move about. The squirrels, the chipmunks, but lots of other things. Sometimes it's an interesting lizard, sometimes a bird. Always something.Today I saw two turkeys. They ran away immediately, but as I approached the tall grass a flock of young ones took flight. Rats... Didn't have my camera ready. Later down the trail a whitetail deer fawn raced across the trail, once again, I didn't have my camera ready. I blame it on the wind  but more because I'm just slow. The Doyle is still the Doyle. It's an ancient hotel with rooms to let. That's the best way to describe it. I have a nice room with a bed, a community shower down the hall and a grill & bar down stairs. The folks who run it are typical trail folk, down to earth and hiker friendly.Free shuttle to the grocery, pizza parlor down the street, friendly folk. What more could a hiker ask for?

Whether tiptoeing thru talus fields or negotiating boulders it's hard work. We work (taken lightly) eight to ten hours a day depending on our mood and the day's goal. PA is hard work.That's why I had to stop at the Blue Mountain Summit restaurant and have a cheeseburger and a beer before joining Hong Kong Steve at this campsite. I camped in the back yard ten years ago, but they don't invite hikers to do that anymore.Pat from Wisconsin asked me a question that comes up from time to time. Steve asked me the same question tonight and I've been giving it some thought. The first thing I find most different is technology. Consider that in 06 we didn't have phones that could show you a weather report, or better yet a radar plot. We had to just deal with the weather as it came at us. Trust me that's huge!Still, the trail has timeless qualities. There are still nice little towns, vast forests and amazing views to be seen. Perhaps the other big change is me.

Well Conductor the Blue might as easily be known for his goofy memory lapses. Take rain making for instance.... Now where did I put those field notes ... Ah yes, here it is (spectacles adjusted)  Making rain is a simple matter of the setting up of a tent without a rain fly, aligning it with the Summer Triangle such that the blue light of Vega penetrates the upper mesh. Note: The porosity of the mesh will be directly proportional to the pourosity of the ensuing rain! I had my alarm set for 05:00. However, at 04:55 I awoke to the sound of thunder. Not soon enough. The rain began before I could get out of my tent. Barely got the sleeping bag under the shelter roof, had to sacrifice the pad. Geez! The forecast was for clear weather the next 48 hours. This has happened to me every single time I have set up without the fly. The storm lasted about an hour then the sky cleared up once more.

We are somewhat out of sync with our weekly shower schedules, or sumthin like that.I hiked steady today to get up and over Mt Greylock, MA's highest mountain. Thirteen miles away, on the other side of the mountain, my good friend and 2015 Thru Hiker Neon and her husband Don were setting up an epic! trail magic event.I had given them an ETA between 12 and 1, arriving at 12:55  Neon greeted me with open arms and we enjoyed the next few hours catching up and talking with the hikers who came by. Don kept busy making grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, while Neon did everything in her power to treat the hikers well. Now, for those of you who are not lucky enough to know Neon, let me just say she exudes the energy of a group of preschoolers on a zoo outing. Pretty sure she doesn't need a flashlight, ever I lingered at the trail magic tents for about three hours sampling at least one of everything, I think. Neon brought me a special request; orange juice. My body craves it. Lots of good potassium.

I hiked into Mizpah hut by 1 PM and enjoyed some leftovers they put out for thru hikers Pushing on, not sure how I managed it, but I arrived at Lakes of the Clouds hut in perfect time for a work for stay. Ironically, it was at this hut I did a work for stay in 2006. The difference was in 06 it was storming and they took all thru hikers in for work for stay. I think there was ten of us. Today the weather was partly cloudy and it was actually a pretty nice day. I just timed it right.I'm on one trekking pole. One of my tips broke, so I strapped the broken one on my pack and carried it since yesterday. Oh what the heck. Plenty of places ahead we'll be carrying poles.Of all the people on the trail, I never expected to see Junco again. I had hiked with him before the Smokies. Great guy, who got off to attend a wedding. Just walked up to me here at the hut! Magic of the trail So my work for stay chore was washing the last of the dishes. Looking at the small pile I expected a short stint, lol. As I finished the stack a new stack took it's place. That stack replaced by utensils, then came the pots. Finally, a stack resembling the original stack. My hands had not been this clean since March. An hour and a half later the pile began to shrink. It was like something out of a cartoon.

Mount Washington was a relatively easy climb and the weather at the place with the worst weather in the country was superb. I bought a pricey tuna salad sandwich at the snack bar and charged my phone for a few minutes down in the hiker pack room. The day was young, which was good because it turned out to be very long. The next ten or so miles consisted of above tree line awesome views coupled with a boulder strewn series of named trails. Had to make our way to Madison Springs hut on the sharp, coarse to touch boulders, which is extremely tiring work. I almost felt sorry for my boots, but they were the only thing I wanted touching those rocks. A stumble would mean blood and lots of it.After the hut I climbed Mt Madison and began the long series of drops and traverses down towards Pinkham Notch, three thousand feet below. I hiked alone among the crowds of Saturday hikers, eventually getting down to tree line and finally into some forest.I made it into Pinkham Notch about 7 PM. Late for me. Checked the lodge desk to see if there were any bunks available, knowing the answer before hearing it. The lodge was full. After all it was Saturday.The clerk told me there were some good stealth sites along the AT, but after half a mile with no sites I saw a sign that said ""There are no legal sites along this trail."" I lost it.Turned around walked back to Route 16 and stuck my thumb out. It was 7:30 PM I started walking toward Gorham 10 miles away with a shower and a bed on my mind. No one stopped. When it got dark I turned on my light to make me more visible. A hundred cars passed me by. I just kept walking with my thumb out. About 9:00 PM a car pulled over. As I approached I noticed it had Michigan plates. Go figure. A fellow named Chris who happened to be in the vicinity supporting another hiker took me in. Chris asked me if I had a reservation in Gorham and I said no. He said there was some sort of event and the town was pretty full then offered to let me camp at his campsite. My luck just changed. A very very arduous day had come to an end on a high note. Not sure why I had headed for Gorham, but I can say that my judgement was impaired and if not for Chris it might have been and even longer night.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

He has taught me several different birds and their songs.The trail today was real dirt  and actually a nice departure from last week's journey. The day went fast and although I took my time Junco never caught up. I heard later from some section hikers that he had found a blueberry patch and was enjoying it. He prefers to stealth camp alone anyway so I don't expect to see him tonight. Besides, I'm doing the same thing.Not a lot of good opportunities to stealth camp in NH. Glad I got at least one. Most of the dispersed camping sites are now ""revegetation sites."" Meaning they don't want you camping there. But enough of NH.

It was in one of these obscure places that I found the pitcher plants. Apparently, this particular species is endangered.Later on we forded the west branch of the Pleasant River, another not quite knee deep fording. Tomorrow we'll pass over the last set of mountains on the trail before Katahdin. White Cap is where we can expect to see a good view of the big mountain for the first time.I arrived at the shelter just as it was getting dark, tent spaces were not easy to find, so I opted for the shelter, as did Shoe who arrived at the same time. Always good to see his familiar smile.","Long Pond Lean-to

Two moose were grazing there. First moose that I have seen in Maine. No big antlers, but those big bulls are a little more timid.Up and over what we call the White Cap range, which may not be correct. White Cap mountain was the tallest, so we NoBos just refer to the group of peaks as such. The last high peaks before Katahdin. Coming down on the north side there was a side trail with our first unquestionable view of the big mountain. Pictures still don't do it justice, but soon we'll have some really good views of it.OK, why am I not counting down anymore... Well, Beth and Maggie decided the trip was too long and too costly. It will actually be less expensive for me to fly home. The silver lining in all that is a day early on summiting Katahdin. So, if you must know it's K-3  All of us have been cranking out miles. Two more twenty milers and a short day gets us the Birches campsite then all that's left is the Big K.","Newhall Lean-to

All the others are tenting, although the weather reports have been consistently forecasting rain tonight and into the morning. Now, I am not fond of sleeping in shelters, but I'm all done with taking down my tent in the rain. Tomorrow's hike is just short of twenty. It will be the last long day on the trail. If I get to the destination early enough I may make one last push in order to reach Abol Bridge. Only if I could make it before the store closes at 7:00. Hate to say it. Nothing special about today. It was a flat walk through the woods. Got a nice view of Katahdin from Pemadumcook lake, but otherwise just a 21.5 mile trudge through the woods. Hey, I love woods. I've been living in them for five months-- Aaaaaaagggghhhhh! .....thank ewe.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to

Guess I made the right choice by sleeping in the shelter. I was up and out by 7:00 headed toward Hurd Brook Lean-to, but for some reason I hike faster in the rain and I arrived at the shelter before 4 PM. Abol bridge was only another 3.5 miles.So, I stepped on to Golden road at 5:00 PM, exiting the 100 Mile Wilderness on day five. I'm a day ahead of schedule and if all goes well I will finish this hike on Wednesday instead of Thursday. I must admit that I was hiking hard and fast all day. It feels kinda good to be out of the HMW and on the doorstep of Baxter State Park.The trail was extremely wet today. Some of it was actually flowing water. In other places the puddles were unavoidable. Don't care  the wunnaful thing about waterproof boots is that on a day like today you can soak your feet in cold water all day and it doesn't leak out. Katahdin is shrouded in clouds. Hopefully in two days it will clear off. The weather report hints of that.","Wadleigh Stream Lean-to

Started out after breakfast at the Abol Bridge restaurant, which was included in the bunk room stay.I was number five of twelve on the sign up sheet for the Birches campsite. It's a full house tonight. Everyone is nice, but I have not known any of them for more than a couple weeks. Shoe summited Katahdin today; Tumbleweed yesterday. It's all good. A lot of my hiking friends will follow. Some have already gone back to their life before the trail. As I pack up in the morning, part of the packing logic will include the idea that my tent will no longer be needed. My bag and pad need not be accessible. My food bag will go into the trash as soon as I get to town. It has holes in it from the mice two nights ago.I put a fire together tonight. Most of us sat around and talked about our experience over the past several months. It's been a long time since I sat around a campfire. Didn't have a lot of them on the trail.It's an early wake up tomorrow. I want to leave camp at 0600. We'll see  I just might sleep in.","Abol Bridge

Wolfing down the cherry pie AND the Danish I bought at Abol store just for this breakfast.On the trail at 6:00 in humid morning air that was heavy and still. The trail seemed to take forever to start going up. Gradually it became steeper then steeper. We passed Katahdin stream falls as coolness began to creep between the trees. Another eternity up now steeper terrain through gradually shrinking trees. AJ and I stopped at the spring, downed the remaining water in our bottles and filled up.Eventually we broke above the tree line, but the climb had only just begun. Above us the Hunt spur was in and out of clouds. Here is a short video. View climbing Katahdin The wind had picked up and would continue to build until we once again ducked under tree line, but that would be much later.The scrambling was fun for me. The others were apprehensive. I knew that feeling. By the time we reached the gateway, the clouds had converged on everything above. We crossed the tableland in wind and cloud. I had to remove my misted glasses and put them in my pocket. By now I had put on both my down jacket and my wind breaker. It was a different world from the quiet humid campground down below.Half an hour later, still climbing, I was 50 feet from the sign before I heard voices and realized I had come to the terminus. There were only a few of us thru-hikers there at 9:30 AM. I waited a few minutes for my opportunity for a the sign photo and Gummi Bear snapped a few for me through the clouds. As for me, I loved being inside the clouds. We all hovered for at least half an hour; reluctant to let go of the moment. A large raven joined us, landing nearby. Probably looking for a handout, but it was surreal to be that close to the large bird.Ninja-Hoops and others expressed their anxiety about going down the crazy Boulder scrambles we had just climbed, but I was able to put them at ease; knowing it really wasn't as bad going down. Others confirmed this as we descended our last miles.An hour and a half later we were back at the ranger station collecting the items we had left there, while slack packing the mountain.Katahdin is without a doubt the most intense, yet the most exhilarating 5 miles of the entire AT. A fantastic way to end a journey of such proportion that all we can do is remember moments one by one. As many of my companions have expressed today. It will take some time to get our head around this.It's over. Really? Does the trail ever really end? Ask a hiker.Conductor... Signing off.","The Birches

Conductor,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547624,"After a week at home slowly working back into my old routines I am wondering when my feet will fully recover. I've been sorting through the thousand pictures trying to both remember the past five and a half months and organizing it into a comprehensive pile. Not making much headway.It is not all that difficult to rehabilitate into sleeping in a comfortable bed, wearing deodorant and having long face to face conversations with Beth. What is difficult? Not stuffing my face constantly, just cause I'm in town. I will do a little bit of editing on my gear list for anyone seeking reviews. I must warn you, I can be harsh. Just as the trail can be a harsh environment. I may also try to get the YouTube video's working from the left hand menu.And finally, some acknowledgements:My awesome and beautiful wife, Beth, made this all possible. She has made me who I am today, supports my crazy adventures and laughs at me when I need it.My friends and family. Thanks for always being there. The guest book comments sustained me through many rainy days.My anonymous and not so anonymous readers. Some of you have even become friends. Thank you for following my meandering thoughts. I hope you had a few laughs, some excitement and a sense of wonderment. I did. It was always great to hear from you and in some cases actually meet you. Do I miss the trail? Not really. Maybe in a year. Right now, I am reminded that I walked 2189.1 + umpteen tenths uncounted miles every time I stand up.Thanks for coming along.",,My Feet Still Hurt,"Sep 02, Fri",0
