Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518290,"I am in the planning and preparation phase of this exciting new quest I am about to embark on. Many question and things to learn but I am sure the trail will answer them all in it's own time. Still trying to figure out my gear and equipment, checking it over and over again and watching weight like a mad man. Will begin to start testing everything after the holidays and make note of how things work and don't.",,View Entry,"Dec 11, Fri",0

Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518536,"Today marks 99 days till I start my AT thru hike. I'm learning that I can procrastinate really good! Still working out gear and will start testing everything after the holidays.The plan is to get geared up and start hiking and and testing at the 90 day mark. As I use gear I will post in gear section on how things work and don't work so maybe other people can use the information and see what I will actually be taking. I was asked how I will train for the hike in Houston Texas. Light weights for knee strengthen, and upper body, not for mass just toning. Will do two days a week on incline treadmill and three days a week hiking. We have vast power line systems here that go for miles. They can be extremely muddy, thick wet grass areas and fairly uneven terrain. I'll work with what I have, carrying full pack on hikes and let the trail do the rest.Don't want to walk the streets and roads as drivers here will run you down and not think twice about it. Will be much safer on the AT. ""Bears or People in cars?"" I'll take my chances with bears. Lol!Peace Out hiking mates, will make next entry at 90 days.....",,View Entry,"Dec 20, Sun",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518814,"It's hard to convince yourself to get out of a warm bed put on a backpack and start walking when your home. Some how I talked myself into it and off I went. It was 4am, got up made some coffee and went outside, it's 42 degrees, damn, do I really want to do this? Yes I do! Got dressed stuffed some weight into my pack, approx 13.5 lbs, strapped up the laces on my boots and off I went. It was now 4:45am.I really had no plan, just needed to start walking. Started down the road from my house, no one is really up at this time of the morning, which is good, I really don't trust people in cars anyway! Walked about an hour and was hoping the sun would start to break so I could hit the power lines and continue my trek. Still to early for that and I have already walked about 3 miles.So I decided to hike the power lines anyway, surly the sun would be coming up soon? Broke out the trekking poles and started through the sludge, mud and grass of South Texas vast power line system, slowing my pace and again hoping for a sunrise so I could see where I was going. And of course I did not bring a head light, the sun would be coming up soon.....Needless to say I walked another 3.5 miles back to the house, and guess what? As soon as I started to take off my boots, the sun rose and yes, there was light. I wanted to take a photo and post it but it was not to be on this day at this time...All in all it was a GREAT morning for my first hike with the pack, I did 6.5 miles in just over two hours and dreamed the entire time that I was on the AT, a flat section of course!I added some gear to my gear list and will start adding comments as I use things to keep you posted on what I will be bringing and using. I am still waiting on my order for the Tent and quilt. I'm happy with the pack considering it was my first time to use it, I have some tweaking to do to get it right but, I think it will be just fine.",,View Entry,"Dec 29, Tue",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518834,"Woke up this morning a little sore from yesterday's hike but feeling very motivated. Amazing what some weight on your back can do.Hit the road at 5am this morning, cool and damp, typical Houston weather. Completed 4.5 miles and was even able to get a picture.I would like to wish everyone a Happy New Years and may it be the best year yet. For the AT Class of 2016 may we all complete our dreams of completing the trail or whatever challenges you have with health and prosperity. Peace...",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Wed",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518899,"Just finished my 1st hike of 2016 and the reality of hitting the AT In just 87 more days is becoming clearer each day both mentally and physically.   I believe at the pace I'm training I should be as ready as can be for my start date.While hiking this morning some things became clear to me. The support I am getting both here on the journal from people I have never met has been amazing, surprising and unexpected. I can not express how much it means to me and how motivating it is. Thank You!! Also the support from family and friends has been equally appreciated. And of course, my wife, PC. Love you!The biggest surprise has been out in town and having general conversation with folks, when they hear your attempting a thru hike there is a genuine interest and support and they are willing to give information and help any way they can. It is giving me a whole new perspective of the human race and that there are some really awesome people in the worldPeace!",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518999,"Just finished this read. For such a young man his insight and perspectives were on point, in my opinion. It's a look at the mental challenges we face while hiking the AT.He talks about being more mentally prepared then physically, not that the physical aspect is not important but, I believe the mental side takes precedents. It's interesting the games our minds can and do play on us, and man am I living proof of that one!The other thing he discussed that caught my attention was how real Lyme diseases and West Nile were on the trail. I was aware of Lyme but not WNV.. We all here about injuries and a splash here and there on Lyme, but WNV, That was an eye opener. All we can do is be prepared and take precautions.There's a good mental check list on why we are hiking the trail, this was a three part question and may be used later during our hike, both to help you get back on center and re-motivate you at those times you'll need it. (This took me a few days as I really wanted to give it some thought)It covers a lot of ground from food to gear and other points of interest, I would recommend reading it as it really is an easy read. The one thing I would add to this book would be the challenges of living on the ground. No one talks about eating, sleeping or sitting on the ground for days on end. This in its self is a challenge for us civilized folk... If your not used to it, practice as part of your training. Spend three to four days a week for a few weeks living, eating and sleeping in mother natures lap, it will help prepair for what's ahead.Peace",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Sun",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519514,"Went to REI here in Houston for the first time yesterday with my oldest son, WOW! We were both like dogs in Pet Smart for the first time, all those shiny things all over the place, smells and lots of people friends.....Thank God I went in with a list, not sure how I was able to stay on task, it was a neat experience and I'm sure we will both be back again. I was able to almost wrap up the finishing pieces of gear that I will be bringing. Lots of small stuff really, long spoon, sleeping bag liner and other misc. stuff.Wanted to share this photo as I find myself always looking up at the stars and wandering where and who might be looking at them at the same time as me. It amazes me how many people never look up in their day to day lives, night or day, you never know what you might see, everything at ground level looks the same, even my dog likes to be picked up every now and then so he can see things from a different perspective. Anyway, training continues and anticipation builds, days seem like weeks and weeks like months. In the next few weeks I will be hitting some local trails with over nighters and hoping within a month to hike the Lone Star Trail approx 96 miles. Will keep you posted.Peace",,REI First Timer,"Jan 11, Mon",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519779,"Was a good week for training however we have had some strange weather here in South Texas. Yes it does get cold here but not this year. Took this picture two days ago and could have hiked in shorts and tee shirt if not so damp and wet, worked up a good sweat and put in 6 miles before going to work. I've been reading journals of hikers on the trail and weather is to nice for this time of year.   Wonder what it will be like the later part of March? Something to be said about El Niño. Between hiking and hitting the incline treadmill with full pack I'm still feeling good about everything but need to figure out how to prepare for the downhills as I really need to strengthen hamstrings and knees, think I'll be good on the ups. Anyway, I received my A.T. guide book and am looking at all my options for my start as I really don't want to make hard plans but just roll with the trail and enjoy it and take what it gives me.Enough for now, any input for strengthening knees for downhill is welcomed.Peace",,Training Continues ,"Jan 17, Sun",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520120,"Just received duplex tent and felt like a kid on Christmas morning. Tore into the package at lighting speed to see what it was, yes, it was my tent. It was to dark to set up so tomorrow would have to do. Was up at 6am sharp and it was still to dark. Got some coffee and stared at it waiting for sunrise, it took forever, another 45min, I hate when that happens. Finally, it was time to set up my new tent, took 5min and was super easy. Almost disappointed how short it took but was happy with the reality as this will my real time on the AT.Of course I had to share this with everyone but they were all still asleep, it is Sunday morning. Finally, as each one awoke they had to come outside in 35 degree weather to see and watch me get in and out of tent. They are so accommodating. Love you guys!And of course I have to share this with my journal family as well. It was worth the wait and appears to be very well made. Hopefully my first trip with it will be next weekend, however, I will probably do an overnighter in the yard.Peace",,Duplex Tent,"Jan 24, Sun",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520280,"Well it's 60 days till I start this journey of a lifetime. I am nervous, excited and anxious all at the same time. One thing is for sure, I'm looking forward to getting started and putting these game time jitters behind me.My gear is complete, except for some minor adds like a lighter, Vitamin ""I"" and a few other misc. things. My pack base weight is 17lbs and I am very happy with that. I will be adding a small camera that should be under 1lb so if my estimate is right I should be at or around 18.5lbs when done.I'm thinking I will be carrying about 2 liters of water and 3 days of food on average so my total hiking weight should be around 28-30 pounds. I believe this should be a doable weight for a long distance hike, I keep second guessing myself and don't want to over work it, I feel like I'm getting obsessed with it and I don't want to do that! Guess I'll just roll with it.Now it's time to start focusing on food. I don't plan on doing drop boxes but instead working with what's going to be available to me on the trail from town to town. I'm pretty freaked out about this because I don't know what to expect or what's available. I don't mind eating bad but also want to eat healthy to give my body what it needs for success. I will stir this one around until I get started on the trail. Again don't want to over work it but this is a big one.....Training is still on track and have some trips set up over the next 2 months to nail everything down when it comes to gear performance. Still trying to figure out footwear, boots or trail runners, I have both and will decide as it gets closer to starting. I've been trying different socks with liners and I have to say Darn Tough socks wins hand down for me, these are keepers!Peace",,60 Day Mark,"Jan 27, Wed",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520690,"I have found myself reflecting over the past few days why I'm hiking the AT. It's almost like being in a vortex, sucking you in, preparing, planning, reading and not being aware of what's going on around you because your so focused on the trail. It has consumed most of my daily thoughts, I'm sure it has yours as well, if your in the planing stages of your hike. This morning my wife said I bumped into her getting ready for work, I don't even remember this happening, NOT GOOD! This will be corrected.....I've always been interested in the way of the Native Indians, their lifestyle, belief's and ability to adapt and survive off the land since I was a young boy. I was raised to be free and explore almost without expectations or consequences due in large part to the amount of time I spent traveling and camping in the mountains and across the country with my parents. We did this all the way up till the time I left home and joined the Navy, always living in the moment and loving the outdoors. I love, miss and thank them both for this GREAT GIFT and opportunity, what a way to grow up! It took me until my mid 30's to figure this out and understand this was a gift. Never being in one place longer than another, shifting from school to school and always being on the move, just like the way of the Indian... I was extremely lucky and privileged to be raised in such a way!I've always been amazed by people who have never had or taken the opportunity to explore beyond their own back yard. Meeting new people, seeing new places and experiencing different cultures, not doing this is beyond my thinking. My love and spirit for adventure has been in my blood since birth, I know no other way, between growing up outdoors and free to being in the Navy, I have always been on the move seeking new adventures. Hello A.T., it's right in my wheel house!I am going hiking/camping this weekend with my oldest son, I think I've created a gear monster, he's hooked! I'll be checking gear and performance and will update gear list with results.Peace,",,Reflections,"Feb 04, Thu",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520955,"Took me a few extra days to make this entry after last weekends hike, camping and gear check. Added some more information to the gear list if you want to check it out as well. So this is how it played out:1. Tent. First night we had rain after set up almost all night, bone dry inside and kept one flap open for venting. (As seen in photo) Second night very windy with gust up to 35mph, held up with no problems. (Outstanding product) Had condensation on the inside as to be expected with the weather, wiped off in the morning and dried out fast.2. Sleeping pad. This has the R5.7 rating and man does it work! Slept warm both nights and is well worth blowing up at the end of a hiking day. I let some air out of the mattress and was very comfy, hips did not touch ground.3. Quilt. I have never camped with a quilt before so this was a new experience. First night temp was around 40-45, slept with just a t-shirt and underwear, no socks but did have some drafting issues. Drafting was a user error as I did not strap quilt to pad as recommended. Second night much colder and windier, temp was 35, with the wind chill factor I would have put it in the upper 20's. After strapping to pad, drafts were gone. Slept in a long sleeve base layer shirt with underwear and again no socks. Best night sleep in a tent ever. I am VERY happy with this set up. No sleep means grumpy hiking days...4. Foot wear. I will start with Merrell Low Cuts, they fit well and I have been wearing them for about three weeks with zero issues. I also put some smart feet (green) in-soles in them and man what a difference, happy feet make for happy hiking.I won't bother you with clothing but will say that everything checks out so far and I am happy with my gear selections. If you have any question or input please let me know as I am open to learn or help as much as possible.I will be going on a longer outing/hike in two weeks on the Lone Star Trail and will post again after that trip. March 27th is right around the corner and man am I excited...Peace",,Weekend Gear Check,"Feb 10, Wed",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521143,"I have created a Facebook page so I can interact with everyone instead of one way communications. The Facebook page is ""Hike with Loan Star"" I think it will be easier to send photos, videos and respond to people easier this way. I'll be able to show more of the trail than one thing each day during my hike and be able to answer questions better with a group of people. I want to make it fun!I'd like to give it a try and see how it works before hitting the trail between the two, Facebook & Trail Journals.So if you wold give me a like on Facebook and we will see how it goes..Peace",,facebook page,"Feb 14, Sun",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521713,"I just completed an 18 mile hike of the Texas Lone Star Trail this past weekend. I had a chance to check out my rain gear as it rained most of the time, this is what I wanted and this is what I learned.Rain gear does not keep you dry, it keeps you warm. If the rain doesn't get you wet, the sweat will! All my gear has passed the field test and is complete for the A.T. I will have to learn a little bit more about wet weather hiking, camping and packing up in the rain but, I did pretty good for my first pass at it. (I could survive) As strange as it sounds, I actually enjoyed hiking in the rain. (Weird)Anyone having the opportunity to hike the Lone Star Trail should, it's a great trail, the only issue is packing water as their are very few places to get it. I hiked section 9 which was packed with tall pine trees, wood bridges in what they call the Big Creek Area. Yes, there were creeks but you would not want to get water from them! (Very muddy water) This area Floods fast when its raining..... The down side is having to pack in all that extra water, I had an additional 3 liters of water which doesn't sound like much but when carrying an additional 6 plus pound of it for a extended distance it can zap your energy pretty quick. At the end of the first day my legs were shaking by the time I got to camp and set up. I'm sure this is only the beginning of many shaky leg days.Anyway, I have added additional photos on my Facebook page ""Hike with Lone Star"" if you want to go and check them out, like the page while your their, seems easier to add photos and videos then on here. It was a GREAT weekend trip and my training continues. Just over a month till I can start the real hike......Peace",,Lone Star Trail,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522587,"Here we go, 19 days until I head to Georgia, holly crap I can't believe how fast the time is going!Since my last entry, I hiked another 4 1/2 miles two days after my Lone Star Trail hike and that put me at 20 plus miles for that week. Last Saturday I left for a 5 day cruise and had a GREAT TIME and got home Thursday. Needless to say I did zero miles this past week. I feel like I'v lost some motivation and am struggling to get re-motivated.So, hears the plan. I will do some moderate hiking this week and then next weekend I have a 2-3 day overnight hike planned with my oldest son. I sure hope this gets the fire going again, my head is full of doubt but I believe this may.be normal for a journey of this scale.....I will be leaving for Georgia on the 24th to spend a few days with my wife their before I start my hike. We're planning to hike the falls on the 25th and then do the .9 miles to Springer and back on the 26th, we want to share the start of this adventure together. Then on the 27th she will drop me off at the Springer Trail Head and off I'll go.If anyone reading this needs a ride that morning the 27th let me know, would be more than happy to give a ride to a fellow hiker. Wish me luck on getting re-motivated, either way I'm going.....Peace",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Sat",0
Lone Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523572,"In a mere 8 days I will be on my way to Georgia, I'll be spending a few days at the Lodge before hitting the trail on March 27th.Can't even begin to describe the things that are  going through my head, can I do this, will my legs and body hold up, what's going to happen to my real life, and on and on it goes. I'm excited to get started and see what the trail has in store for me.   I have prepared the best I could and will let the A.T. kick my ass to get me where I need to be. Hopefully I will meet someone who wants to take their time and not be in a rush to conquer miles, who will take it all in and enjoy the journey.  (We'll see)One of my hobbies is chain saw carving so I thought I would share one of my pieces for a picture. My next entry will be from Georgia, YAY!  I will continue to post pictures and videos to my Facebook page @ Hike with Lone Star, give it a like so I can see if it's worth keeping up with........TIA.Peace",,So close ,"Mar 15, Tue",0

It's amazing, you wait and wait for your time to come and the next thing you know it's here, it's almost surreal. For those of you still waiting, I feel ya, you can believe your time is coming and I wish you all Good Luck and health on your hikes.I'm done with all the training and researching everything AT, now it's time to put it all into action. Reading the Trail Journals here of future, current and past hikers has helped me both in my perspective and preparation for the trail, I hope my journey will be of help to others as I journal along the way.....
