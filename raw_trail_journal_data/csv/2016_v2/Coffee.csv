Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520355,"In a little over three months, I will be departing on my second attempt at thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail (I had started my previous hike back in 2011 but had to come off the trail to care for my mother). I am thrilled to again be preparing for what should be the adventure of a lifetime! Bring on the flip flop!",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520357,"My gear is generally the same as that of my earlier AT attempt but a few items have been changed out to reduce weight. I had hiked some of the PCT a few years ago and had changed my backpack, water treatment system and sleeping bag in preparation for that hike. These changes were a necessity as I had to carry more water on that hike than I had for the AT - equipment weight had to be reduced to allow for water. I will be using this newer equipment on this hike also, but am still on a mission to reduce pack weight - more trips to REI, I guess!",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520360,"The reasons for one to attempt a thru or section hike of the AT are probably as varied as the people themselves - as the saying goes, ""Hike Your Own Hike""! My reasons for this hike are varied including the desire to experience all that the Trail offers, both good and bad. One does not know exactly what will transpire out there as the variables are many: weather, equipment, health, food, etc. That is the essence of the adventure and the test of oneself in trying situations. A common thread in all the books and journals of those who have hiked before, is the mental toughness needed out there. I know there will be days that I just want to quit and go home, but those are the days that you have to power through. Because those are the days that make the good days so much sweeter - it is those sweet days that I am looking forward to with the understanding that the tough days serve as a stepping stones to the good days!",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528719,"Well, unfortunately I have to push my previously-scheduled 2016 thru-hike back a year to 2017. My elderly mother is selling her home and my sister and I will be spending the next few months working with her to go through things and get the home market-ready. Really really bummed, but will be looking forward to 2017 as we work on the house! Who knows - maybe the house will sell quickly and I can do a section hike later this year!","

Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551660,"151 more days till the adventure starts! But who's counting!  Gear is good to go, but need to finalize my tentative schedule and mail drops. As a former financial analyst, my love of Excel spreadsheets has turned my initially simple schedule into a bit more than what I probably need. Oh well, I'm sure it will not be long into my trek when the schedule becomes obsolete!I also need to work on various food options, trying to optimize what to buy at resupply points or have mailed to me. I'd like to keep the mail drops to a minimum as I don't want to be tied down to having to get to town by a certain date. I'm also trying to keep the mail drops to a minimum to reduce the amount of work that my husband, Marc, has to deal with. He'll have enough to do while I'm gone in taking care of the house, the cabin and the pets.I've also joined the gym to work on core and upper body strength. Amazing how many muscles I've awoken from years of sleep! Lol!",,View Entry,"Nov 20, Sun",0
Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552742,"Just got my new Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runners for the hike! I had read about them in the January 2017 Backpacker magazine issue and, as advertised, they are EXTREMELY comfortable, especially with the wider toebox. Looking forward to getting out for some hikes next week with the pack on! 112 more days!","

Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553599,"What a way to fight off the blues of a gray, drizzly day here in southeastern Michigan - got my AWOL A.T. Guide in the mail! It's all I can do to not spend the rest of the day refining hike logistics! Well, the start of my hike is now just 90 days away. Time is ticking away with lots to do with logistics, conditioning and meal planning, but I feel confident that I will be ready when the time comes around. One thing I am doing before I depart is getting the word out that I intend to hike to raise awareness for both the Cystinosis Research Network (CRN)and the National Ataxia Foundation (NAF). My northbound trek from Maryland to Maine will be for CRN while the southbound portion of my hike will be for NAF. Most people have probably never heard of either condition - I know that I hadn't! In 2008, Josie, the daughter of a friend of mine was diagnosed with Cystinosis, a rare, genetic metabolic disease that causes the amino acid cystine to accumulate in various organs of the body. Without specific treatment, children with Cystinosis develop end stage kidney failure at approximately age nine. Josie has a daily regimen of many medicines to take, but will still need a kidney transplant sometime over these next years as cystine continues to accumulate.With respect to ataxia, my mother was diagnosed back in 2006 with spinocerebellar ataxia. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a term referring to a group of hereditary ataxias that are characterized by degenerative changes in the part of the brain related to movement control (cerebellum), and sometimes in the spinal cord. Symptoms may vary but may include an uncoordinated gait, poor hand-eye coordination, and abnormal speech, all of which my mother has, although, sadly, she can no longer walk and is confined to a wheelchair.I am so very lucky to have the health I do and am privileged to be able to hike to benefit those with ataxia and Cystinosis - bring it on!","

Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553710,"Despite the rainy, cool conditions, I ventured out for a short hike this morning at the Kensington Metropark Nature Center. No one else was out there except for me, which I found absolutely wonderful! Saw ten turkeys at the start and finished up coming across a herd of nine deer. I rather like hiking in these conditions, sometimes, as the woods are much more quiet than they would normally be - other than the distant sound of interstate traffic, the only thing I could hear was the sound of Canadian geese on the lake and the patter of rain on my rain jacket. The rain also intensifies the smell of the woods and the dead leaves lying on the trail waiting for the next snow. I love nature!","

Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555264,"Hard to believe that it's still February up here in Michigan! Got out for another shakedown hike with my backpack today over at Brighton Recreation Area and it felt more like very early spring than winter. In fact, it felt much like the second day of my last attempt at an AT thru hike back in 2011. The warm sun on my face, hearing the birds singing and seeing some of the grass starting to green - that sweet memory came flooding back as I hiked along. Can't wait to get started in April on this next attempt. Backpack felt good and I am ready to go. Well, almost, there's meal logistics to finish and some business to be taken care of before I go, but I do feel as though I'm mentally and physically ready!","

Coffee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559520,"Well, my flip flop plans will have to be shelved for the time being and I can't tell you how disappointed I am. I suffered a concussion a couple of weeks ago and am still working through several post-concussion issues. It's been a much slower process than I had anticipated and has set me back with respect to the start of my hike. At this point, I'm not sure if/when I can get out there this year. I am hoping that I can at least do a section hike this year; time will tell. In the meantime, I just wanted to let everyone know what's going on in case you were wondering why I hadn't posted anything lately. I know that there are worse things in life that could happen, so am grateful for every day that I can get up in the morning and hear the birds! Hiking is just on a temporary hold and I will get out there once I am healthy again!","
