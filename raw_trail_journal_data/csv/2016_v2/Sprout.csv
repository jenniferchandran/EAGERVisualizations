Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487217,"Hello? Hello? Testing. Is this thing on? Tap tap tap. 
My name is Kimmy. Or in less than a year I will become Sprout on the Appalachian Trail.
I never thought that it would be so hard to announce to friends and family my plans to leave and hike the Appalachian Trail. How do you tell them ""Hey, i love you, but I am running off to do this incredible, amazing, hard thing"" and not have them feel like it is because of something, or it is something you can be talked out of, or think that it is just a pipe dream. Or they will just flat out not believe their ears! 
I am 27. I have a wonderful husband & amazing 7 year old son. I am currently a full time stay at home mom & housewife. I love my little life. Which leads many to the question: if you love your life, aren't running from anything, & are needed at home why would you up and leave it all behind to go live in the woods for six months? Won't you feel guilty leaving your baby behind? Yes, i will miss my family & i love them dearly. If nothing else they will be the reason I see this journey through until the very end. But i have a huge love of adventure and I want to do something that is larger than my life, something bigger than me that I will have to leave behind me when I am no longer on this earth. And it will make a really cool story. 
I love my life, i love my little family. But that isn't to say i have never felt bored or bogged down by routine &, moreover, bogged down by feelings of unhappiness by having SO much. How can you be bored when you have so many things to fill your time? The answer is simple. I have become so used to it all & so jaded by technology. We are all so connected we spend more time staring at our screens and talking to people through our computers than we do living our life in the moment and talking face to face. ""So turn off the screen. Get rid of your phone. Live off the land. Become a homesteader."" Lol. I may have exagerrated that a bit, but you get my point. Sometimes to drastically change our way of life we must do something drastic.
Last June we did that ""something drastic"". My husband, my sister, & I took a week vacation to hike some of the Pinhoti Tràil in the Talladega Forest & Cheaha State Park. And i had never felt so fulfilled in my life by anything. There were no distractions, i was fully in the present, i never felt bored, & i had everything I needed to ""survive"" on my back. Life becomes so easy when you simplify it to a few random pieces of gear and lots of walking. I realized then how hooked I was on this feeling & i became obsessed. Over time i missed the woods. I missed the feeling of being so far from our modern world. While hiking i jokingly told my sister ""how cool would it be to hike the Appalachian Trail or something?"" It was just a stray thought that i spoke out loud. At home i found some hiking movies on Netflix. Mile...Mile & A Half about the John Muir trail & a National Geographic documentary on the Appalachian Trail. Then i found books. I devoured them. Once I was finished with as many as i could find on my Kindle I read them again. I watched more documentaries, read more books, signed up on WhiteBlaze out of curiosity and then after thinking for about 3 months while on a ""date"" with my husband I blurted out in the middle of Walmart ""I think I want to hike the Appalachian Trail."" Of course, i had told him bits & pieces about it. What i had read & learned. But i never expected his reaction. Silence. It took a good month before he brought it up to me again, without looking like he wanted to sob. This was one thing I knew i could not push. I had to give him the time to consider it on his own, accept it, & open up. And when he did he shook my whole world.
He was behind me! 100%. He asked what I would need. He wanted to know more & more & with that I began planning & started to buy things. Started making lists & notes, doing more research. In less than one year I will fulfill this dream & it has me more excited to put into words. As the fears & doubts start to creep up i reaffirm myself. I can & will do this. Its one foot in front of the other. My husband isn't able to pick up & take off so i will complete this dream for the both of us. I can't wait. I am so ready. And as i watched others leave this year on WhiteBlaze, facebook, Instagram, trail journals the envy that swept theough me was like none other. Soon that will be me, Sprout, on the AT.",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Tue",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/489481,"ac·count·a·bil·i·ty
noun
the fact or condition of being accountable; responsibility.
One of the first things I did when considering this journey was read Appalachian Trials by Zach Davis. I have seen it recommended over and over by other hikers, saying this book was what helped them make it to Maine and up Katahdin. One suggestion from that book was to make lists and read them over and over, add to them, chant them, make them your mantra because at some point there will come a time when you ask yourself ""WHY THE HELL AM I DOING THIS AGAIN?!?"" . Those lists are 1) I am thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail because... 2) When I successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trail I will... & 3) If I give up on the Appalachian Trail I will... My lists have been completed for months. And i DUG WAY DOWN DEEP to write those babies. I opened it up and let it all out. I may share those here and I may not. We will see.  
The second suggestion was PUBLICLY STATE YOUR MISSION. I did this slowly at first my best friend, my husband, my mom (who eventually told my dad for me because the thought of telling him was HORRIFYING!). Reactions varied. They were either very gung ho, you have got this, you can do it OR they were horrified and mortified and basically asked me if I was batshit insane. No, no i am not. I am a girl with a mission. Some came around quicker than others but I know now that I have such a HUGE, amazing, incredible support group that believes in me. But today, today was the day I got brave and told SOCIAL MEDIA. Or, well facebook. Anyone that followed me very closely on Instagram probably had a good inkling that something was going on.  I was poking around and ""waiting for the right time"" ""waiting for the perfect moment."" There will be NO perfect moment to tell everyone that you are about to do something truly epic. But the most surprising thing of all has been the overwhelmingly POSITIVE support from people. Well, besides all the likes from people I had probably forgotten about. Who are you people again?! Just kidding, mostly. Haha! 
And i will tell you the moment I announced my plans it all felt SO VERY REAL. This was going to happen. This is such a huge moment. Seeing others reactions and reading their words of support really AMPED me up. Just as much as it had when I first decided to hike the trail. Secondly, now I have put my self out there and I am now accountable. People know about my journey, people know I am serious about this and will be my motivating factor any time the thought of coming home crosses my mind. Becoming accountable feels like one of the best things I have done yet to make this into something I AM DOING. 
Mentally prepping myself is such a huge part of going into this for me. All the gear in the world and all the money in the world will never get me to Maine. It will be my mind over physical hurts and mental anguish. And i believe it is my strongest trait because i am ONE HARD HEADED GIRL. So far there have been no Negative Nancies, but I know at some point they will come and when they do they will only make me want to complete this even more.",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Wed",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/490319,"Many months ago in a galaxy far, far away (okay, not that far, it was in January) I got brave and decided to write a number of companies asking if they would be willing to sponsor or support my thru hike. After lots of checking my email, I gave up. Yesterday I got two fortune cookies in about five hours. The first read ""Good news will be brought to you by mail."" The second read ""Something nice is coming for you in the mail."" After thinking about it and realizing I had nothing coming by snail mail I dashed to my email. Lo and behold! Matt Harris from Health Warrior had answered my email and had agreed to sponsor my thru hiking adventure! Welcome to the Tribe, indeed. My spirits have been through the roof today even though I am not feeling well. To have a company believe in me and want to support me goes beyond my wildest dreams! Talk about a morale booster. If i am not on the right path, I don't know what it would be. Big shout out to Matt Harris for contacting me and supporting me. Your confidence goes a long way. Also it is not everyday that a company selling Chia seeds and Chia bars agree to sponsor an Alabama girl with the trail name SPROUT!! I had many laughs about that!",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Thu",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/492132,"Today i applied to be an Appalachian Trials blogger. Part of the very short application was ""Why are you hiking?"" I think i blew that question. I replied something like ""I love travel & adventure and can think of no better way to do both than with my own two feet."" I don't even think it was that in depth, actually. Why am i hiking? I need more than just a tiny box to explain that. To distance myself from everyday distractions. To have an epic story to tell. To be able to not just TELL, but prove, to my 7 year old son he can be and DO anything. To reconnect with nature. To live more simply. To become happier with less. To raise awareness with the ACS about ovarian cancer, as the child of a strong & amazing Mom who beat the disease and lived to see another day. To be able to say i did something most wouldn't ever attempt. To spend hours in the woods pretending in my own mind I am Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, running from the Capitol. To have an amazing achievement under my belt that I can be PROUD of. To kiss the sign on top of Big Momma K. To become a part of trail society and interact and bond with people that share a single common goal with me. To meet people my kind of crazy. Because i like peeing in the woods and eating the same dinners day after day cooked over my tiny backpacking stove. Because i grew up exploring the Great Smoky Mountains with my family every year. Because i want to do something badass. Because once i get an idea into my head it won't leave until i complete it. And more. THIS is WHY i am hiking. I heard someone say just a few days ago that people don't care about WHAT you do, they care about WHY you are doing it. My why just happens to take up pages and pages. The what if intoxicates me. What if, after walking through the flames, i emerge a phoenix on the other side?",,View Entry,"May 02, Sat",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/494180,"It is time to start prepping for what i'll be treating as my first shake down of this year. I'll be using my new pack & some newer gear to get a good feel for some of it. Still have a bit to go on gear but i'll have the most important along for this trip. Just waiting on my husband to find out the exact dates. We've decided to go to north georgia so that a) i can mentally prepare for how bad those Georgia mountains will kick my ass in the future and b) so that we can do the AT approach trail together. I'll finally be able to say I have placed my feet on Springer! You know the excitement of meeting a celebrity? That is the excitement stirring deep in my bones! And the ""beginning"" of my AT journey will start with the person that means most to me. <3 Also, it came to my attention that my first few entries dates were skewed. Oops. Won't make that mistake in the future.",,View Entry,"May 12, Tue",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496689,"When i tell anyone that my first multiple over night hike on the Pinhoti spurred my desire to hike the AT, i understand why i get crazy looks. Especially if i have told them about my first night really camping on the pinhoti. Our ""first"" night consisted of arriving at Porter's Gap, hiking through the dark & plopping the tent somewhere flat. But our first proper night, having hiked & set up camp, was an all together different story. I make hiking & camping sound like rainbows & butterflies. It is not. And it's only in hindsight that i can look back & laugh on my first REAL night in the woods. We hiked to the Talladega Creek Bridge, stopped for lunch by the creek across from some train tracks. And we decided we liked it there so much we would stay. Prior to leaving we knew rain was forecast all week but it had been a beautiful (hot, sticky, muggy, but beautiful) June day. We set up camp, built a fire, swam in the creek & enjoyed it. Crawled in our little (7 pound monster) tent (we just wanted an adventure, no one said we were watching pack weight here!) as dark started to surround us. Then here comes the train we hadn't seen all day. The train roars by, blowing its whistle, sounding like a hurricane, we couldn't hear anything but train...and it lasted 30 minutes. Mistake #1. Do not camp by train tracks, even if you haven't seen said train that belongs to them. Once the train has chugged away & our ears have quit ringing we settle in. My husband & sister fall asleep. I lay awake watching ""heat lightning"" gradually roll across the sky and get brighter every so often. Pro tip: it wasn't heat lightning. It started to thunder but it sounded far off in the distance. I roll over & try to doze off, the thunder & lightning continue to get worse. I poke my husband & sister. They kind of root around and shrug it off, this will pass. It doesn't. It gets worse. Then comes the rain. And it doesn't start with a sprinkle. The entire sky has opened up. Mistake #2: we are about 15 foot down a hill, directly beside the river. The rain is pouring down. My sister & husband sleep on. I start to feel trickles. Our rain fly is not on correctly. The trickles get worse. Our bedding is starting to feel kind of wet. It is still flooding. The bottom of the tent starts to feel kind of ""wobbly"". I poke everyone awake. We turn our flashlights on, get a good look. The trickles are keeping on trickling. The bottom of the tent is literally floating. We are now camping inside a floating, staked down water bed, complete with strobe light. I tell everyone we need to pack up. We know if it keeps raining, surely the river is going to come over the small bank seperating us from the river. I had no desire to be floating down a river in our already floating tent. We wait it out, shivering, wet, bedding is wet. Packs are wet. Clothes are wet. We get out our crinkly emergency blankets and sit like hoot owls, eyes flashing in the lightning. We smoke cigarettes and wait for the storm to pass or all of us to float away. At the height of the storm, winds whipping, rain atleast 6 inches deep under us, the train makes its reappearance. The train, the thunder, the lightning, rain & cold sends my sister into tears & rants of ""this was the worst idea. I never want to hike again. I want to go home. I hate this."" All i can do is laugh to keep from crying myself. But eventually the rain stopped, the river about an inch from coming over the bank and we all get a few cold, wet hours of sleep. In the morning we weren't happy campers but we survived & learned alot in the process. Someone told us before leaving ""it will test you out there."" That was it. And those words have hung with me since that trip.",,View Entry,"May 25, Mon",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501595,"It's Father's Day so, of course, I talked to my dad. My husband & I have just returned from hiking the Approach Trail as well as doing some hiking through the backcountry in the Smokies so I was telling my dad about it. He told me ""See, i blame myself. We took you to the Smokies when you were just a baby. You turned one there so now the mountains are in your blood."" My dad isn't a particularly deep man, but that resonated in my soul and maybe explains a lot.Lots of things came to light over our trip. That i need to lighten my pack. That i can do ten miles a day+ and not be sore and miserable. That i might ditch my plan of a bivy and take an Eno. That i may have not one, but two, partners for my thru hike next year. My best friend from diapers, Jacqui, has decided to bite the bullet and join me. At first it was for a few days, then it was a few weeks, then it turned to a few months, and now she is debating just doing the whole trail along with her dog, Panda. I was never worried about hiking alone, even as a female. But I know Jacqui. She is smart, tough, does races on the side of her regular life just for fun. We mesh well, we get each other, we will know when to push and when to stop. I can think of no one else to share this journey with that is more appropriate. We have missed alot of years while we grew into adults but the few times I have seen her it is always exactly like old times. The chance to catch up and share something so wonderful with her excites me down to my bones.Now...about the Approach Trail. We got a rather late start and it was HOT. It was grueling. I wanted to hate that mountain and all the mountains it connected to, except that I couldn't. I saw the Approach Trail as a true test to myself. If i could make it up and down, then surely I was made of the stuff it would take to do that exact routine for 6 long months. There weren't many views, maybe tiny peeks between the trees on the long way up, up, up from Amicalola but the top of Springer Mountain was truly, truly breath taking. We stopped, cooked dinner, took in the sights. I held in tears at the summit. Twice hiking up I stopped, exhausted, tired, more tired that I can ever remember being except for maybe while being in labor for 24 hours, and I sobbed. They weren't long cries, they weren't even totally born out of being hot and tired. They came from somewhere deep in my soul knowing that even though it was a hard hike, it was hot, every fiber of my body vibrated with fatigue, I knew it was exactly where I wanted to be and was meant to be. I would sniffle a bit, rest a minute and continue my trek. If there is anything I am, I am not a quitter & when I say I am doing something, I will. I may do it slower, I may do it louder and more vulgar while screaming at mountains, but in my opinion that's the best way to do it. It's not because I don't love every second of it. And ever now at home in the comforts of AC and showers and coffee from a pot, i find myself wishing I could be back hiking up to Springer, hiking through the backcountry, crossing foot bridges, going on a trek through the woods up a trail that next stopped going up, seeing the wildlife, listening to river crash beside the trail.",,View Entry,"Jun 21, Sun",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504071,"The time since my mind flopped around the idea of thru hiking & now seems to have flown. I have gone on my first shake down. I've finished the Approach Trail. The days go so fast collectively but so slow when you single them out & pick them apart. My body is ready to go & my mind has to slow it all down. ""Be still. Prepare. Soak this time with your family up."" My mind blazes through schedules & miles & gear lists daily and near manic. It is 5 months until Jacqui & I get our tags & register with the ATC. 7 months until we get our permits for the Smokies. 8 until we leave. I want to be doing so much more than I am at this moment to get ready. Time. Give it time. It will be here before either of us know it. I may have romanticised the whole AT thru hike to the point of being excited about every single thing. Ready to rattle whoever may asks ear off about the endeavour, spout my gear lists at them, tell them our first months plan at the drop of a hat. It's those conversations that make me realize how deeply this has taken root in my soul, how strong the pull of the trail is to my feet. When I can't sleep I read Awol's book, flip through my north bound guide, scroll through WhiteBlaze. My plans have morphed & changed so much since the very beginning plans. I had become so used to thinking ""SOLO NOBO"" that I have to remind myself I have partner(s) & one of them has paws & fur. Let the changes come. I am sure the morphing & changing the trail has on me mentally, physically, spiritually will make any changes now seem so tiny by comparison.",,View Entry,"Jul 07, Tue",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508222,"Technically, the buying gear portion of my AT trip started back in April. My husband & I were buying gear to hike the Approach Trail and do some back country hiking in the Smokies on his vacation. I treated it as a shake down of sorts, getting used to my cooking system and water filtration systems that I would be using on my AT hike. But, to be honest, I felt like I was buying things for THAT trip. Never that I was buying things JUST FOR the Appalachian Trail. I know, I'm a woman. Sue me.  But now with my birthday around the corner I have the opportunity to buy gear that I deem just for my thru-hike. *claps* The first of a few purchases is: Injinji socks (because i have heard wonderful, lovely things about them and their blister prevention abilities. I shall see for myself on that!), YakTrax (that i am hoping i might not HAVE to use, but I do expect to see some gnarly winter weather since we are heading out in March), and a cheaper, ultralight hammock (10 ounces) that I hope to use when it is nicer weather, or a shelter is full, and I don't want to put my bivy up. I was weeble wobbling over just taking a full Eno hammock kit, slap straps, tarp, and all but decided that on some nights I would much rather have the ""protected"" feeling of a bivy. And sometimes you just want space that is your own, even if it is a tiny one. Also I am crossing my fingers that the bivy will slightly warmer in the winter weather we may encounter. Being from Alabama my experiences with winter weather are NOT very in-depth. I have been to the Smokies for vacation several times when it was snowing in December. But i wasn't sleeping in it, carrying all my clothes on my back like a pack mule & watching the weight of the things I carried. I also wasn't ever particularly worrying about having hypothermia and freezing to death, not when there was a warm car or hotel or RV to return to. My last winter weather camping experience I FROZE all night long & shuffled a Hot Hands pack around my body every hour or so all night, and quickly realized I needed to up my winter camping gear because summer gear layered and piled just will not cut it like I thought. Buying anything for cold weather makes me nervous. Any suggestions floating around out there on jackets, pants, and the like would be greatly appreciated. That is one of the huge reasons my future hiking partner and super long time best friend have tentative plans to do a shake down sometimes in December-January to hopefully do a full test of all of our gear and test it in some true winter weather. Hopefully we will come out with all our fingers and toes and learn something along the way.",,View Entry,"Aug 01, Sat",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508744,"Today is my birthday & i have spent it like almost every morning this summer. Catching up on news, checking facebook, chatting to my 7 year old, & chugging a cup of coffee. Why does my title suggest something is ending then? My birthday marks the close of the summer for us. Good bye days spent watching movies or playing games with little man. Hello, last of the preperation to send him back to school & jump back into the rat race. Summer days are long, slow, & sweet. School days are not. There's always car lines to go to, errands in town to see to, a play or performance, a PTO or teacher meeting, field trips & functions, homework & lunch packing & uniform folding & folders & slips to be signed. I never thought that I would be THAT mom, the one that hovers & says ""you can't play your games right now, we have homework."" But i am. There's something to be said about falling into the rhythm and schedule of it all though. Everything has a time & a place, no hour is left unused. After the insane schedule of summer I find I look forward to finding my spot back in that same old rhythm. Come January, i will be sick of it and hate it. Curse the regularity of everything and having to fall in line lest we all be doomed. This summer has also had the feeling of finality. I won't see Bug finish out his first grade year because I will hit the trail before he has finished. Irresponsible, some might deem me. I won't spend a lazy summer with him next May, June, or July. Being totally honest, that part makes me a little sad. I will see him for a week somewhere near the halfway point and I will soak up all of his laughs & giggles, as I do now. Being a mom on the trail will be one of my boggest challenges & one of the biggest changes for me. I have been a stay at home mom since I was 4 months pregnant. I will miss Jathen with all of my heart but he will be such a motivating factor for me to see my journey through to the end. We have talked about it & i'm preparing us both for my absence & my leaving. He is already my biggest fan. I have no doubt he will be cheering for me the entire way & brag to anyone he encounters that his Mommy is doing something amazing. I hope one day when he is older it will inspire him to take up his own adventures & his own journeys. I have already instilled the travel bug in him. Our weekends consist of smaller, more fun for him adventures. Zoos, water parks, aquariums, theme parks. If they are within a 5 hour radius we have taken him to do them all, some even further. I want him to want to see the world and everything it holds for him, no matter how scary it may seem. I hope if he learns anything from me it is that fear is only in our mind to hold us back from great things. I want to see him go on to be inspired to do great & crazy &, maybe, irresponsible things. To live without limits. I intend to be that example for him. Love has no limits. Mine for him has always been to the moon, and now to Maine, and back.",,View Entry,"Aug 05, Wed",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508891,"As much as I pride myself on being independent & strong, sometimes we need a helping hand.

I'm so very shocked and pleased at the wonderful companies that have taken their time and energy out to get in touch with me and offer discounts or gear for my trip. That being said i'd like to quickly thank each one personally & by name that will be sponsoring me as I walk the trail. I know that some in the hiking community do not ""agree"" with sponsorships, instead choosing to do it all themselves. This is a very important time to remember HYOK, hike your own hike. Sometimes when reaching for the stars we need a boost! That these companies have taken a chance on me when I could be any one of 75% that do not make it all the way to Maine, is beyond words and all the more valuable! I plan to not disappoint them in any way! And while I might get more sponsors by saying that I am some benevolent hiking goddess, that knows all about the trail & gear, that has never been my approach. I approach them in total honesty. That I am just a young woman that discovered a love for hiking with an insane dream that I am trying to accomplish with my best friend and her dog. Networking and talking to people, and especially asking for help, has never been my strong point. I have extreme social anxiety, I freak out talking to new people, so deciding to take this trip was a HUGE step for me in getting over those fears. I also deliberately reached out to companies with natural, organic products and ingredients. Why? Simply put, i agree with their ideals, methods, and ingredients and believe they are the best for my body.

I was getting horribly anxious because 7 months out I felt like I should be so much better prepared than I was. For my birthday I was gifted some of my gear courtesy of my mom & my lovely husband also bought me some. ^_^ Today in the mail I received my New Balance 759's that I am in LOVE with (and that work perfectly with my Yaktrax, big sigh of relief!) And my ColdPruf base layers came with them! I am always, always worried about fit when ordering online but both pants & shoes worked out really well & fit like a dream! I did make sure to order up about a half-size on my shoes in anticipation of my feet growing a bit while hiking. Even so, i'm totally happy with how they feel. They also seem sturdy enough to withstand a good beating on the trail. I'm sure they won't be my only pair of shoes for the duration but I've already accepted that. Hiking chews up shoes & spits them out! Lol. I also received my package of products from one of my sponsors, RocketPure, to try & then review.

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511279,"I spent so long drilling it into myself that I was a NOBO SOLO, that even now, 2 months after my future thru-hiking partner & long time best friend, Jacqui, announced to me (and the world) that she wanted to attempt a thru-hike I still find it hard to believe that I have a partner. Make that two when you include her dog, Panda. Jacqui & I are about as different as two best friends can be without being totally incompatible. There will be adjustments that we have to make for each other, there will be a learning curve to meshing our hiking styles. But all of that falls by the wayside in the grand scheme of things. It quickly became apparent how much are thought processes sync up. We immediately revert to 5th graders & are able to finish a thought or a sentence. There will be challenges on the trail but there will also be 6 months to catch up on a friendship that got put on the back burner for too long, there will be laughter, team work, oddness, and inside jokes. There will also, I know, be struggles and hardships and days where we just cannot get it together. I also know that at the end of this journey there will be a great story & she will be one of the few that experiences every moment first hand with me. Sees what I see, feels what I feel, walks over every root & past every blaze that I will in the future. People have said that the trail changes you. They've also said many things about post-trail depression & many have confirmed it is, indeed, a very real thing. Will having a partner that not only takes their first steps onto the AT with you affect or change this? My hope is, yes, that when we step off trail we will still be that oddball team that followed the white blazes. And that, not if, when the real world once again begins to whittle at us & one of us begins missing trail life, the other will be able to save the day. Or simply say ""I know what you mean. I miss it too."" Or ""today may have been bad but remember when...? If we made it through that, then today will be nothing!""",,View Entry,"Aug 24, Mon",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512222,"I approached RocketPure several weeks ago about sponsoring my hike along the Appalachian Trail & they graciously agreed! They have supplied their products for me to review, so while I may borrow a few words from their website on the products, all thoughts, opinions, and experiences are mine. Not only are they super friendly, their customer support response times and shipping times are very fast. (And they didn't send me an angry email for taking so very long to write this review!) My package from them came before I was even expecting it! I'm sure some of you have seen my list of sponsors and I focus heavily on products that are natural and/or organic. My biggest question when considering a product for myself is ""Would i feel okay putting this on my 7 year old?"" If the answer is no, why am I even considering putting it on my body? Their website says it best: ""At Rocket Pure, we believe that nature has it correct, so why add non-natural and harsh chemicals to products that go on our skin?""RocketPure's products are ""natural body care for athletes."" When looking at their list of ingredients, they seem more appropriate for you kitchen than your average body care product. No toxins, no chemicals, no huge words that I struggle to pronounce or need to google. No parabens, sulfates, synthetic fragrances, dyes, or GMOs. They are also cruelty free and the animal-mom in me loves that! Their product packaging is minimally designed, while remaining clear on what each product is and how to best use it. Their ingredients are also clearly listed and specified. Ingredients like shea butter, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and various seed oils all make an appearance. When the product arrived I was surprised to find it undamaged and by that I mean that I fully expected some melting of products to happen in transit. I live in Alabama and we aren't known for our cool summer weather but everything arrived in tip top condition. Each product was individually sealed in a ziploc baggy (i'll be stashing those to use later in my mail drops, thank you very much!) and each also had either a band seal or an internal seal for safety. Natural Friction Therapy Anti-Chafe Balm Stick-""No Mess Stick Provides Long Lasting Protection Against Blisters, Sores and Chafing From Sweat, Clothes and Sports."" This product is similar to other ""deodorant"" style application products that I have used in the past. The difference with RocketPure's Friction Therapy is when applied it goes on clear with no visible streaks or white marks. The product packaging did warn that it may stain clothes in some instances but I never experienced this in my days of use.Natural Friction Therapy Anti-Chafe Balm- RocketPure's Friction Therapy balm goes where other chafing products haven't for me by finally allowing an ultra portable, lotion-balm style product to take anywhere and everywhere. I can throw this into my purse or our beach bag and go. This was the only product very slightly affected by the heat during shipping. When I removed the safety seal it was a tiny bit oily but that was quickly remedied by a quick squishing and shaking of the tube and I haven't experienced that since. Friction Therapy balm does go on slightly oily in the very beginning but soaks in very quickly and from then on is totally unnoticeable. It's also incredibly moisturizing. Both Friction Therapy products kept me chafe free with re-application and i'd highly recommend them. These are no doubt going to be the products that are more valuable than words while hiking. Of the two, I prefer the actual balm, versus the stick. I felt like I had more product control as to where I applied it and how much was applied, something that was a little harder with the stick version. They also both have a very light tea tree oil scent that I love and acts as an antibacterial agent, among other things.Natural Sunscreen- I was warned that this product contains zinc oxide as a skin protectant, not a chemical sunscreen formulation, and therefore may cause a white film. When using I put the product on and then made sure to rub it in thoroughly. The white film was much less noticable than I anticipated and didn't dissuade me from using this product. Seeing as I have been super busy with the beginning of the school year the most I got to officially test this was during the long, sweltering two hour wait outside of my son's school while waiting for the bell to ring. Between the heat being miserable and the natural sunscreen being oil based, I did slightly feel like a grease ball after using it but I am still as china-doll pale as I was before using it. The thing that I did notice was that there are no visible lines after using and being in the sun like with some sunscreens. Also, seeing as how I have prominent tattoos that are visible this makes a great quick product to rub on to the ones that recieve more sunlight and i still feel as though they are being protected nicely.Natural LipBalm-- This is the product I thought i'd dislike the most seeing as how it is infused with ""white hot zinc"" and again can cause a white film, and it is actually the product I have used the most since receiving my package and products to review. The reason I thought i'd dislike it was that upon opening the lipbalm it seemed a bit ""crumbly"" in texture and seemed to apply that way straight out of the tube. A quick swipe with my finger and it melts nicely, no crumbly texture or lumps to be seen. I've actually been using this on a daily (okay, multiple, multiple times daily) basis because I love the way it feels on my lips and I am prone to getting chapped, dry lips. I use this in the morning before dropping my son off, in the afternoon before picking him up, before jumping into bed and anytime I think of in-between. I found the opaque color didn't bother me nearly as much as I thought it would because the way it feels is lovely. No heavy, greasy, or sticky feelings. That being said, i'd love to see a natural tint version of this. You can buy the 3 or 1 ounce sunscreen and lipbalm as a combo pack here. One thing that all the RocketPure products have in common is that after using them my skin felt more hydrated and supple than before I had used them. This is due, no doubt, to the highly moisturizing properties of their ingredients. They also remove very easily with just a little soap and water in the shower. I would absolutely recommend looking into their Friction Therapy products for your next hike, bike, or adventure. You can check out these products & more at their website here.",,View Entry,"Aug 30, Sun",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514694,"The school year is now nicely under way. The weather is leaning more towards fall. And my legs are restless. It has been 3 months since our last trip and now I'm bored. There's always more to see, more to do, always just out of reach, playing at my fingertips. Schedule deems this break impossible. There's just no way to travel with Bug in school & my husband working. Weekends are for catching up from the week. Or rather catching up on everything I didn't get around to during the week. I'm sleeping much better after the madness of summer, it's late mornings and later nights. Always crawling toward dawn before it becomes bedtime hours. Still I want to wander. I want to explore. Six months, six months, six months. So close, yet so far. It is never easy to tell my feet, mind, heart, soul to be still. Cursed with a gypsy soul & doomed to want to wander. I've always wanted to live a life less ordinary, more out of the box, more removed from society's ideal of 2.5 kids, one dog & a picket fence. So much of my Appalachian Trail hike is all about that. See some places, do things, laugh louder, be on my own schedule, live life on my own terms, at my own speed,stop always wanting & looking for more & better. Six months until the dream turns into reality. Life simplified to a few things in a backpack, to ""now I walk, now I eat, now I sleep.""

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517464,"Originally intended as a post for Appalachian Trials (see next entry for more info on that) but I didn't want to scrap this entire post, to shorten it for better read through, or water it down. Regardless of where I post it, I hope you will enjoy it.*********Several days ago a friend left a comment on one of my posts. She added the phrase ""Val-deri Val-dera."" A bit of googling led me to find that this ""phrase"" was actually from a 19th century German composition known as ""The Happy Wanderer"". Antonia Ridge later translated the original into the English version that I read and will provode for you. Reading it almost instantly makes you feel like a Hobbit, ready to yell ""I'm going on an adventure!"" while flying out your door with a knapsack in hand. It is the perfect song to sing while marching through the woods, huddled around a campfire, or burst into randomly. And as far as I can tell Valderi Valdera translates into...nothing, simple as that but it my mind it becomes a nice little chant to remind yourself to always be a Happy Wanderer. Without further ado, please enjoy the lyrics:I love to go a-wandering along the mountain track And as I go I love to sing, my knapsack on my back.Valderi, valdera, valderi, valdera-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Valderi, valdera, my knapsack on my back.I love to wander by the stream that dances in the sun, So joyously it calls to me ""Come join my happy song!""Valderi, valdera, valderi, valdera-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Valderi, valdera, come join my happy song.This started the wheels turning in my brain. How can we (as hikers) become happy wanders, apart from just ""embracing the suck?"" Here are my top ten suggestions to make your meanderings just a little more cheerful.1. Take the time to smell the roses.This doesn't always mean you have to stop and literally smell the flowers. We will traipse through so many beautiful places it would be impossible to stop at every single one but that doesn't mean you have to fly by all of them completely oblivious, only thinking of the fact that you've got to make it x amount of miles today. Take the blue blaze to the overlook, even if it is a few more feet away. Stop for a moment to chat with that hiker sitting on a log. Enjoy your lunch at a scenic spot for just a few extra moments. Take a break to put your feet in a river and just be. Linger at that particularly homey, cozy shelter or hostel just a little longer in the morning. And if a particularly gorgeous flower happens to be near the trail, by all means, don't hesitate to stop and give it a sniff or just appreciate that it is there just check for bees first (I learned this from experience).2. Learn to play red light green light. This should go without saying but if you are hiking for any amount of distance or time, please listen to your body. you feel awfuSometimes l the first 15 minutes you awake, muscles you didn't know existed scream, you have ACTUAL bones in your feet and think they are probably sticking out the soles of your shoes, and your eyes feel so heavy they may be dragging the ground behind you. After a few minutes, some very awkward shuffling, and a few moose noises later you may feel okay. If you don't, know when to push onward and when to take a chill pill. Long distance hiking is a mental game but you are still physically pushing your body in ways it may have never been pushed before. Try to get some healthy food in you some time, get some extra rest, stretch, get some fiber and probiotics in you, take anti-inflammatories when you truly need them, remind yourself to drink more water. You put good in and your body repays you by putting out WERK, son!3. Listen to your mind. Accept the negative that it has to say, then let it go and focus on the good. Yes, you may have broken a tent stake, your poncho got a hole in it and is leaking like an old battleship, you haven't seen the sun in 4 days, and your feet feel like sponges left in the sink too long. These things suck, no matter who you are. Linger on them for a moment, accept that at this moment you can only attempt to fix the problem or live with it for a bit longer, and then let it go. Maybe you hiked 60 miles in those 4 days or improvised your tent set-up to work with the remaining tent stakes. Focus on those accomplishments. A negative mind will only lead you to negative places. If nothing else try to think about what you look forward to. Did you save a brownie and a latte mix packet in your pack? Awesome! Reward yourself for all the slogging and enjoy it for dessert then remind yourself that tomorrow you may finally see the sun or make it to town to dry your, uh, everything and buy new things that are no longer working out or that have broken.4. Learn the act of bartering.There was once an age where bartering was a much more acceptable form of currency, you are now living in it again on the trail. Let me sum it up in a math problem for you. Frank Four Toes has 8 cookies & no fire. You have 6 matches & no cookies which you most definitely should have gotten at your last resupply but forgot. The question is how many cookies will you eat now and how many will you eat later after trading Frank Four Toes your matches for his cookies, assuming Frank Four Toes does not growl at you while snarfing his cookies like a troll under a bridge? The point is no one wants a dollar when they can't use it in the middle of the woods but some trading back & forth when you both need/want something can benefit both parties.5. Get rid of what doesn't benefit you & embrace what does. This can mean people or things. If you have tagged along with a group regardless of the fact that you do not mesh well, part ways. If you feel as though you are holding someone up or someone is holding you back no one said you have to stay with them for the duration of your hike. People come into your life for a reason and a season and it is perfectly okay to let them go and hike your own hike. Some of the reasons may be: a) your hiking styles or speeds vary wildly, b) their behaviour is something you deem unacceptable for whatever reason, c) they are going somewhere you hadn't planned on visiting or vice versa. Accept that you may or may not cross paths again, say your goodbyes, and don't dwell on it. If we are talking about things, the same principles apply. These things are most likely holding you back and slowing you down unnessarily. Ditch them in a hiker box or pack them up and send them home at your next stop. Just because you thought it would be a good idea to bring something along in Georgia does not mean it is still a good idea to have it in Pennsylvania if you haven't even taken it out of it's stuffsack. I'm no super ultra-ultra-ultra lighter but if there is one thing I have learned that makes me the happiest, it is when I can reduce pack weight and save space for more coffee grounds or a book.(Feel free to insert your own thing that you love that would make you do a little wiggle just knowing you have room for it. Also, don't judge me. I love my coffee and my literature.) 6. Be willing to go with the flow or as my partner would put it ""learn to wing it!"" You will have days where you did fewer miles than you planned or got sucked into the town vortex longer than you said you would. You will have days where something major breaks and you have to creatively modify it. Then you will discover you happen to suck at creatively modifying and you woke up at midnight to a half deflated sleeping pad that is like sleeping on a sad pile of ramen noodles and just as comfy. You will have times where a small injury requires a few days of nursing and you are stuck in one place when you would rather be hot footing it toward your next goal. These things can happen to anyone and instead of asking yourself 'why me?' ask yourself 'What can i do to make this work until I am back at it?' or 'When i get back on the trail how can I make up for lost time or make sure I don't go zooming off into the next town only to disappear for a week?'7. Embrace your 'aura'. I don't mean those lovely colors from your chakras or the vibes you send out, folks. I mean, embrace your stink, your hiker funk, your eau de you! No one smells good after a week without a shower. Some people smell alot worse than that. All the deodorant, Dr. Bronner's, & laundry soap in the world will not fully relieve you of your own personal funk that has been brewing for several days. We will all get to a point where we are less than fresh. Eventually you will wander into town for a 45 minute shower and the smell of soap will be so strong you will suddenly realize the full-on assault cleanliness can have on your nostrils after so long without it.7. Make an effort to document your trip. This will help you recognize the good & the bad that happened on each day. Write down the names of the fellow hikers you met. Make a note of interesting sights, animals, or people. What might you do differently? How did you feel today? You don't have to go in-depth, small blurbs will do. When you are back home & missing the journey your words can act as a powerful transportation device. While you are on trail they can keep you motivated, help you map your progress, keep track of your moods, and more. Take pictures of scenic vistas, shelters, hostels you visit, sunrises & sunsets, the main strip in those little trail towns, the people you meet. You may remember things from your writing or the picture in your mind, but pictures really do speak a thousand words.8. Choose your stance on technology and when/how you use it. In keeping with the above, choose when, where, and how you will use the few devices you bring along on the trail. Will you make phone calls every night that you have a signal? How often will you browse or update Facebook or Instagram or update your TrailJournal? Will you use your phone for pictures or a camera? How often will you seek out an actual computer while in town? Will you be bothering others who are going technology free for their hike? Just be courteous about your usage. And remember it is a GOOD thing to check in with friends & loved ones back home, especially when you have had a particularly rough day but don't let technology take over the moment and forget what's happening right in front of you.",,View Entry,"Nov 16, Mon",0
Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517466,"I said before I even officially started planning this journey that if I was going to hike I was going to tell my story. Be by this blog, social media, or a memoir one day. So many people inspired me to undertake this journey through their various ways. Boots & Backpacks & Seeker on Instagram. Awol, Amish & Skywalker's books. Eventually I stumbled over Zach Davis' book Appalachian Trials & then the website. I knew after a couple weeks that I wanted that to be my outlet. I wanted to be a blogger for them so bad that I could taste it. And so I made it happen. I am not one to sit & wait for destiny to find me. Instead I go out & grab it.

All of those little worries are slowly fading away. Now, 64 days out from my start date, my biggest thought is ""This is happening! Oh my, it really is!"" The shakedown:Went as great as could be expected! We did about 11 miles in 2 days. Not huge, but the main purpose was to reconnect with Jacqui, meet Panda & really introduce her to her hiking gear, as well as try out gear that we have acquired. Jacqui & I, of course, still click so incredibly well, even after so many years apart. No problems there. Panda is going to be AMAZING to have on the trail with us. She is so well tempered & care free, nor to mention well behaved. I love that dog like one of my own already!As far as gear, I did not get the chance to test my quilt from Helium Hiking Equipment.  The maker was swamped at Christmas with holiday orders & contacted me yesterday to let me know it will ship around February 1st. There may be a night or two where I take to the front yard when it is coldest (which for Alabama MAY be 30) to try it out. I love my inflatable sleeping pad. Thank you, Klymit! I will never go back to a foam pad. Being a side sleeper, this kept me off the ground on my hips & shoulders,places that I normally have pain from the ground or shelter floors. Also, if there were rocks under me, I never felt them! I may pick up a stove similar to the one Jacqui just picked up before our shakedown. I believe it is a Primus. That will be the only major change in gear I undergo. The biggest drawback to our ""winter"" shakedown was that Alabama seems to have forgotten about true winter. It was 70 or so in the daytime & maybe 50 at night. One night was very windy as bad weather was blowing in during the night, but nothing too serious. It was foggy & drizzly, but never cold or flooding. Mail drops:As of the last month these have been my main focal point. Despite being told that it ""is not possible"" to do a thru hike while making healthier food choices, I am sticking to my guns. I have picked up some variety oatmeal. Some gluten free, some organic,all containing lots of whole grain. I've also gotten a good protein powder that is Mocha flavor (brand is Chike) that is also fortified with a slew of vitamins & minerals to fill in nutritional deficiencies. Chia and flax are staples in all boxes,as well as some jerky or meat type of bar. Trail mix, pumpkin seeds, dried peas, and a variety of dried fruits are also throughout them. My unhealthy meal will usually be dinner. Pasta sides, Mac and cheese, hamburger helper sans meat, rice sides etc, all with a dash of coconut or olive oil for fat. I'll also be taking a long some electrolyte replacement and probiotic drink mixes, along with emergen-c drink mix. I get tired of water easily & I am a major sipper but overall I never drink enough & it often leaves me feeling drained. I've also included packets of crackers or pop tarts as my ""junky"" snacks. Don't get me started on bars. Each drop box thus far has 11-15 different bars but they make for a quick snack or lunch. Most feature ingredients that are easy to pronounce, organic, gmo free, vegan, or gluten free. Take your pick, because there's a huge mix of all the above.

After much flipping I've decided to go with a hammock. The bivy I was considering was well over 2 pounds. Not a huge sacrifice to pack weight until you start to add everything up. My husband actually had a huge hand in this. One morning after dropping little man at school, I got a text. ""You need to talk to this guy. He's interested in helping you out for your thru hike."" Thank you, husband! He knew how worried I had been about my sleep system and the amount I had flipped on what I wanted to take with me. Sometimes our first instincts are always what we should go with, this was just fate's way of giving me a nudge in the right direction. That guy happened to be Rick at Cave Creek Hammock & Outdoor Gear . Lucky for Rick, he was spared my usual sponsorship email that is about a page long, containing various links & reasons why he should like me(though I did flip flop on that a bit). After several Facebook messages and a phone chat a few days later, Rick told me he would see what he could do to help me out after talking to his fabric provider. Apart from a top quilt, I have an entire hammock set-up thanks to Rick and the awesome folks at Ripstop By The Roll. This was not your typical ""place an order, send it, get your item."" When I say it has been awesome to work with him, I truly mean it. I am pretty much a newbie when it comes to hammocking. I have slap straps, I have a cheap grand trunk hammock and Eno. I've not taken the time to learn about ridgelines or whoopie slings. There was a lot that I simple DID NOT know. Besides letting me have a hand in the custom build length and colors of everything from tarp to hammock to underquilt, Rick was kind enough to point me in the direction I should go for things like suspension, how to keep my weight down, and a few general set up questions. In just a week or so, I have learned a massive amount more than I ever thought I would know about hammocking. Another reason I'm so excited to be representing Cave Creek Hammock on the trail: Updates. From letting me know that he had acquired the fabric to individual steps, I was involved and updated nearly every step of the way. Don't get me wrong here, this was not a slow process like I thought it would be. He has whipped up nearly an entire setup in days. Now for the good stuff  Specs on all the gear!Hammock (netless) made with HyperD 1.6,weight (minus suspension) 11 +/- ouncesThe ""Roaster"" 20 degree underquilt made with HyperD 1.0 in hot pink & Robin's egg blue (above in pictures), 3/4 length (I'm short, don't judge!) 45""Wx48""L with 7.25 ounces treated 800 FP down.

I came home and I felt defeated. I hated myself. I considered section hiking. I proclaimed the AT and long distance hiking were not for me. I avoided social media and my email because I didn't even want to think about what I walked away from. A little over a month later, with time to settle my head and reflect, I'm as much in love with the trail as ever. I'm planning to go back next year and make it MY year to really do this thing. I wanted to regret trying at all, because it a sense I had 'failed'. Except that I didn't. I attempted and I LEARNED. So, so much in such a short span of time. I made friends with a few people I genuinely miss & stalk on instagram and facebook. The AT worked it's way into my heart before I even knew what was happening. But I understand why I had to come home. My body has literally made it clear. I came home with terrible knee problems. Now close to 6 weeks later they are feeling better and I'm not walking like a ten thousand year old woman. The limp is gone. I'm not eating ibuprofen for every snack and meal. Apart from knee problems, I came home with an intense case of bronchitis I wasn't even aware I had picked up. I knew I felt awful for the few days before getting off trail, my energy was low, I hung my hammock just a few miles into one day & slept. For 5 hours. It wasn't until I went to the doctor for raging strep and rib pain that had been there since leaving the trail, that I found out I had bronchitis. I was so congested I didn't know I was congested. A week later, I got an ear infection. My head stayed clogged for a week and then my eardrum burst. Finally started feeling better and now I have a sinus infection and a repeat of the bronchitis. My plan had been to let my knees heal, probably in 2 weeks or so, and return to the trail. Everything else sidelined me. I finally had to say OKAY, BODY. I understand, not right now. My son also went through a case of strep and pinkeye. I heard you too, universe. The strep started the day I got back from the trail. My mommy senses must be outrageous, to work from 8 hours away. My plan for next year is fairly simply. I'm walking as much as I possibly can now. My energy levels have actually never been better, despite feeling like general gross. I'll be going solo, I'll be hiking my speed, my miles, and my own hike. No drop box planning, just conventional resupply. If it has to be via gas station, well, I REALLY like honey buns anyway! And hopefully I will have shaved even more ounces off my pack weight and gear. I loved my set up and my gear this trip, but I know there's room for improvement. An ounce is an ounce, call me a gram weenie all you like!  I'm spending my time now putting together drops from my own I had planned for this year and sending them out to hikers i've become familiar with on social media and/or App Trials. I firmly believe that you get what you give & I truly hope some treats and snacks gives them the boost they need to keep going. There's so many people I'm rooting hard for this year. So class of 2016, go rock it for me now so I can live vicariously. My countdown is, once again, on.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538233,"2 months since coming home. 2 months of doctor visits. Whatever sent my immune system nose diving has been driving me crazy. This week my facebook has been nothing but memories of the past 2 years spent...doing what else? Hiking. And so I sit home and look at the pictures and wish with all that's in me i could have continued hiking. Instead I'm popping z packs and steroids and gearing up for another doctor appointment in the morning. My soul literally hurts watching everyone from home continue on their journey, doing what I was supposed to be doing. I'm just trying to put my faith in the knowledge that I can still do this. The trail isn't leaving. It SUCKS but it is what it is. We're working on buying a house and I know, with that done, things will be easier back home when I do return. There are reasons things dint work out the way we plan or hope for them to and I try to remind myself of that often.","
