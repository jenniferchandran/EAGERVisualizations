Southpaw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527841,"At the hiker hostel I was able to meet the man that runs the hostel at the end of the trail, met him in 2008 when all us hikers got backed up in the town because Katahdin was closed down due to weather. When it opened 70+ hikers reached the top in one day. He says it is a story he relates often.","
