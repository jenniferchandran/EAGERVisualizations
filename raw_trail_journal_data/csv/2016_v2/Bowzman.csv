Bowzman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552059,Gotta have 3 entries so heres #2. Will turn 61 on trail april 3rd. Hope its my best birthday ever. As long as these old knees hold up i believe i'll do just fine. Love the outdoors and challenging myself. Always been a endurance type guy ( cross country running in school. Triathlons in my 40's. 100 mile bike rides etc) but this will be a LONG endurance. Mentally tuff enough i think just hoping the old bones will take one more challenge. See u all out there,,maine,"Dec 03, Sat",0

Bowzman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552982,"Getting more and more excited. Riding my bicycle (hard pedaling to build strength and endurance) 20 miles 3-4 days a week. Doing lots of lunges, toe raises, stretching etc. Hope it helps at the beginning of my hike. Have to drive 3 hrs to get to any hills to hike so i've hitting the treadmill for some but intend to do at least a 2 day hike real soon. I've slept in the back yard at 25 degrees a couple times. Stayed plenty warm. Hope to meet some of you soon",,training,"Jan 05, Thu",0
Bowzman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554756,"Counting the days now. Going to continue training, ( hard pedaling 20 mile bike rides, walking lunges, toe raises, treadmill with 40 lb pack, etc)., until 7 days before then lighten up and let muscles recover. Anxious to meet ""Forrest"" on springer. We're going to start together. My brother is driving me down to springer on the 10th. I'll camp and get started on the 11th around 8-9:00 when Forrest gets there. Messing with my gear frequently to get familiar as possible   Not making any plans as far as how many miles i'll hike daily. Gonna listen to my body and try to stay healthy. I'll update my journal as often as possible for anyone following. Ttyl",,22 days to springer,"Feb 17, Fri",0
Bowzman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555020,The time seems to be flying by now. I've been thru my backpack too many times to count. Always thinking i can eliminate some more ounces. Some things i could replace with lighter items but its a matter of comfort   Probably have a LITTLE too much in my food bag but just thinking about hiking makes me hungry. Ha ha    Been reading some other journals of people that are starting within a few days of me. Seems i'll be surrounded with good people including a couple guys i'm starting with. Should be a great experience. Im easy going and have a good sense of humor( so i've been told) so im excited to have some good times. Try to hide the pain on my face and encourage everyone on ?? Till the next entrie   Happy trails ya'll,,14 days to springer,"Feb 22, Wed",0
