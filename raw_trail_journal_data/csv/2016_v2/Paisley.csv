Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519014,Since I left the trail and have been trying to function in society again I find that seeing beards makes me sometimes smile and sometimes feel melancholy. Before the trail I was not fond of seeing facial hair on men. Since returning it is quite the opposite. It reminds me of a wonderful adventure I experienced in my life. At the same time it reminds me that that adventure has yet to be completed.,,Facial hair has me missing the trail,"Dec 30, Wed",0
Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518907,"For the first time since I came off the trail in July I am truly happy. When I came off the trail I told myself I would eventually finish the trail through section hiking over the years. But a week at a time on the trail does not compare to immersing yourself in the trail for months. So I have decided I will work hard to save up the funds to go back to the trail this summer to finish my hike.
I plan to go back to the Bellvale Creamery in New York, my last good memory on the trial, and continuing from there to Katahdin.
I am a very goal-oriented person and hiking the Appalachian Trail is a goal I want to complete now, not years from now.",,The Trial is Calling....,"Jan 01, Fri",0

The honeymoon phase when everything is wonderful, even the unpleasant things. I am paying special attention to hikers starting about the time I did last year, March 30.

At the top of Bear mountain are three vending machines as well as a deer waiting for somebody to buy chips. Lots of litter on the mountain trail, it is sad to see. After you descend you go through the trail zoo then across the bridge over the Hudson river. The climb after the bridge was taking so long I was going to stop at a campsite but I somehow missed it and ended up going to the Graymoor monastery, they let hikers stay at the ball field shelter. I was glad things turned out the way they did because after all of the Appalachian Trail books I have read I have always wanted to stay at Graymoor.

I texted the hostel at 8 a.m. to reserve a bunk for Thursday and Friday.I stopped for a snack and checked my phone to find out that the hostel had no availability until Saturday. The only other option in Falls Village with showers is an expensive hotel.Went into town for my mail drop at the post office and told them I had just missed the open hours of the restaurant in town. The staff at the post office called the restaurant to see if they could still feed a hungry hiker. The response was, ""Send her over."" They let me in the closed restaurant and made me a cheeseburger and I had a soda.It was now the heat of day and I had a resupplied (heavy) food bag, 2 liters of water and a 900 foot climb to a shelter that was three miles up the trail and a half mile off the trail. The restaurant owner said he lets hikers tent on his property. So I hung my hammock with plans to do that 900 foot climb during cooler morning temperatures. I made a reservation for a room 7 miles up the trail in Salisbury for a shower and laundry tomorrow.

Kemosabe and I started up the trail together but I eventually slowed and he hiked on. My plan was to hike to the base of Mount Everett and save the steep climb for cooler morning temps.Today's hike went well up and over Lions Head and then up and over Bear Mountain, the highest point in Connecticut. The Bear Mountain descent is into Sages Ravine which is where the AT crosses into Massachusetts. Sages Ravine was beautiful. Next climb was Mt Race which had over a half mile of exposed ridge so you could see for miles. Exposed during the heat of day but thankfully there was a breeze. At the bottom of Mt. Race is the camp I planned to stop at. It was 3 p.m. and it always makes me question if I should stop that early. But I did, I would prefer to do the steep climb during cooler morning temps. Funny thing was that after setting up my hammock, in the shade, there was a breeze and I was sweaty so I was actually chilly and had to put on warmer clothes.

There's a side trail to an Outfitter so I went to get a new fuel canister. Then some of us hikers ordered pizza for dinner.

Had a little red squirrel eyeballing my Food Bag looks like he nibbled on it because there are a couple of small holes. I will be storing my Food Bag inside the lodge tonight.

We're getting close to Kennebec River where you are ferried across in a canoe between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. This shelter is just 3.6 miles from the river.,"East Flagstaff Lake

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549005,Up and on the trail early to beat the crowd to the ferry crossing at the Kennebec River. When I arrive at 8:30 a.m. Kimosabe and I were number 5 and number 6 in line. 10 minutes before the ferry started three hikers forded the river. Thankfully they all made it across safely. After our canoe ride we headed into Caratunk for a small resupply to get to Monson. The Sterling inn had an excellent resupply available. They then gave us a ride to the pub so we could get lunch. While there it started raining so we stayed there until the rain passed. After lunch we sat in the hiker Lounge and watched Law and Order. At 2:30 p.m. we are back on the trail. We did 4 miles before Caratunk and 5.7 miles after Caratunk. Another day of great terrain.,"Pierce Pond lean to

Both mountains today had multiple balds across the mountain. Gorgeous hiking weather today. Had lunch by Moxie Pond. Every stream listed as a ford so far has only been a rock hop due to low precip this year in the Northeast.,"Pleasant Pond lean to

Gorgeous hiking weather again today. Hiked to get close to Monson so we can nero tomorrow and zero on Sunday to rest before the 100 Mile Wilderness. As we hiked today Kimosabe was ahead of me and asked south bound hikers to wish me happy birthday when they crossed paths with me. I really enjoyed that. One of those south bound hikers was ridge runner Lacey.","Moxie Bald Lean To

Thankfully the forecasted rain didn't happen. Beautiful trail, looked like an enchanted forest. Across Big Wilson ledges which gave us views of the valley.

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550127,Second day in the 100 Mile Wilderness. Temps stayed pretty warm last night. Nice hiking today. Barren mountain was a little slow hiking due to wet rocks and steepness. Once Cricket and I got to the Barren slide the skies cleared and we had great views. Sat there and had lunch. Stopped just before the Chairback mountains. We will tackle those tomorrow.,"Wilson Valley Lean To

Great hiking weather again today. Our mountains today were: Gulf Hagas, West Peak, Hay Mtn. and Whitecap. The last substantial mountains before Katahdin. The mountain range today had a lot of trail maintenance in the form of steps and stepping stones. It was beautiful on top of Whitecap Mountain, out one mountain that was above tree line and gave us views. We sat up there for a couple hours with many other hikers.","Carl A Newhall Lean To

Paisley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550131,Today is food drop day!! Good thing because my food bag is empty. It rained during the night and we are getting cooler fall temps now. You had to keep moving to stay warm. We started the day just five miles from the food drop location so we slept in a bit and were on trail just after 8 am. Food drop was scheduled for noon. I arrived at the road at 10:45 am and the other three were already there. AJ from the hostel arrived at 11 am with out food boxes. We loaded the food into our packs and had mostly flat trail for the next 11 miles to Antlers campsite on Jo Mary Lake. Gorgeous location.

Kept the long shirt on all day. It is definitely fall in Maine.Even the 100 Mile Wilderness is not impervious to day hikers on the weekend. Only saw a few and are surely locals that know there way around the logging roads.Easy terrain today made it to camp just before 3 pm. Gathered firewood for a fire on the beach tonight. Kimosabe, Cricket and I shared a site. Other hikers were up the beach at another site. Our site came with a camp chair someone left behind.Saw Katahdin across one of the lakes today. Awesome!","Antlers campsite

We saw two otters floating on the lake in the morning. After sunrise we had full sun on our camp. We soaked it up because we knew it would be cold back in the woods. We had a mountain to climb this morning which helped warm me up. But the rest of the day was chilly and I had to add layers.During the afternoon while I was hiking along a stream a black bear crossed the stream and crossed the trail just 100 yards ahead of me. He never looked to his left so he never saw me. I have been on moose watch since entering Maine so I was shocked when I saw the bear.","Nahmakanta Lake campsite

Today was the last day in the 100 Mile Wilderness. The weather was gorgeous and it even got a bit warmer. Amazing views from Rainbow Ledges and Abol Bridge of Mt. Katahdin.I was pushing for Abol Bridge by lunch time to have real food instead of trail food. On a final stretch a bee stung me in the shoulder. Once at Abol Bridge we had lunch, got a cabin, shower, laundry, resupply and dinner. Our cabin stay comes with breakfast in the morning.","Rainbow Lake campsite

He just wasn't alive.Beautiful trail today into Baxter State Park with some rock hops across streams and some small waterfalls. Reached the campground just before 3 pm. Checked in at the ranger station and the three of us set up camp for the last time.

I have completed the Appalachian Trail!The forecast was cloudy with drizzle so imagine my joy when I got above the tree line and saw blue sky. Katahdin is a tough climb but I was more worried about descending after I summitted.I hiked alone and was quite emotional on the climb up and the climb down. But when I reached the actual peak I was just happy and relieved.  THANK YOU to everyone who followed my journey and left me encouraging words. I can't tell you how many times I went back to the guestbook to reread those postings while I was on the trail. It meant a lot to me. A special thank you to my mom for coming to Maine to take me home. We had no way to communicate the last week and just had to hope we could find each other after I summitted. It all worked out fine.,"Katahdin Stream Campground
