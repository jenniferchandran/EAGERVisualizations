Booklady and Rev. Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523939,"We have spent months walking 700 miles to get in shape, researched and purchased all our gear, hiked on sections of the Florida Trail to prepare, eaten lots of trail food to narrow our choices, weighed and re-weighed our packs, shocked our family and friends by announcing our intention to hike the AT, and now we are in the final countdown...",,Friends and Family,"Mar 18, Fri",0
Booklady and Rev. Dad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524280,We are down to the final preparations. I am practicing loading and unloading my pack so it becomes routine. Tent set-up is going well - I love the fact that you can set up the footprint and fly and then climb inside and set up the tent if it is raining. We walked in the rain and used our pack covers to the amusement of our neighbors. Today we walked four miles and intend to go up and down the only sizable hill in our neighborhood several times. It's time to hit the trail and do all this for real!,,Time is getting short!,"Mar 21, Mon",0

Finding hills here is a challenge, but we have several in our neighborhood that we go up and down. Snow and cold weather aren't something we have either, but we have the clothing and equipment we need to face both. We have had six months or so to prepare and now we are anxious to hit the trail! I found a muscle today that I didn't know I had - aches and pains are going to be common soon. My mantra is ""I think I can, I think I can..."" from The Little Engine That Could. In the pouring rain, the endless uphill climb, the grueling daily challenges, that is what I will be saying in my head. I look forward to the day when I can say, ""I thought I could, I thought I could...""   One step at a time....",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Thu",0
