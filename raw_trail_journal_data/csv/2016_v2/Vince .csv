Vince ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502727,"Just making sure the journal is up and running in Code A shape. Short hike today through the Tallahassee humidity. One step at a time, and lots of water. Maybe a cold beer or three at the end. I do think I hear the Ferm calling my name. Later","Blairstone R.

Vince ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517763,"Interesting way to spend the morning. I was on my way to see my friend Dr. T who teaches @ App. State in Boone, NC and slammed on the brakes of the Jeep when I saw a sign that said access to the one and only A/T! The sign said something about Laurel Fork Falls so I dug out my much beloved and dog eared copy of the 2014 ALDHA Thru-Hikers companion and looked it up. My friend had to meet with two of her students that morning, so off I went. What a hike. I do believe Pennsylvania loaned some of it's rocks to Tennessee. Great hike. Went up to the Laurel Fork Shelter first, cool place. Someone's gear was there, but alas, not hiker in sight to talk to about their journey. Hiked down to the falls after that. What a serene and peaceful setting. Hopefully the shitty pictures I took will upload. Nice way to spend the day. Those white blazes show up in some of the most unusual places. Anyway, much preparation left. Next shakedown cruise for gear should be soon. Beautiful weather right now in The Sunshine State, currently it is 70 degrees F in Tally Ho. Later dayz y'all.

Vince ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518732,"Hiked the Cadillac Trail between Tom Brown and through Lafayette Heritage this am. A few hardy souls out walking and mountain biking. Plenty of f'king mosquito's to keep me company though. Weather here is definitely out of wack this winter. Who am I kidding. What winter?  Anyway, great hike, saw a beautiful Pileated Woodpecker, and a huge Red Shouldered ? Hawk. Magnificent creatures. I wish I was better at identifying them. A little over five miles and a good reason to have a Jai Alai with lunch. Getting ready sell my Jeep, my last four wheeled transportation. After that, M/C, mountain bike or as we used to say in the suck, LPC's. For the uninitiated, that stands for Leather Personnel Carrier's. Enough useless babbling for now. Good friend of mine is getting out of the joint in a couple days and I have to prepare. 24 years is a long time. Lots to do. Many things left to prepare for the A/T hump also. Just about have all my gear. End of May is coming soon. Like Tallahassee said in Zombie-land, ""Time to nut up or shut up. See y'all down the road. Happy whatever you celebrate this time of year. Too many f'king holiday's for me to keep track of. Later...",," Lots of heat, humidity, and mosquito's","Dec 25, Fri",0
Vince ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529224,"Did a nice shakedown hike before I left Tally Ho. Cadillac trails twice with my bud Kathy. No elavation to speak of, but still 10 miles with the ruck at about 37 lbs. Felt good. Small amount of pain in the middle of the back. Up in PA now to help a friend build an addition on his garage. Long journey up, to include a busted pushrod, primary belt shredded to confetti on the side of I-77N in NC (Thanks John), Lost cellphone in VA at a gas stop, Shovel not coming off trailer when ratchet straps did, Trailer coming off truck, We doggies, must have been something from a previous life. On a final note for this entry, thanks to those who hoisted one with me at the FLounge on the 7th ? of April. Great turnout. Thank you all. Check out St. of Aioli by the Loca Latina. Girl has got some talent. Just wish she had a better subject to work with. 3 June should see me in Maine. See y down the dirt trail...","Maintenance and such

Vince ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537273,"Slight delay in game. Summited and came back down Katahdin. Slight problem with tendon in right knee. Hobbled down in the dark. Oh well, such is life. Been giving it a rest at Phil Pepin's 100 mile wilderness camp. Nice place. Monson is a nice town. Neal and his crew @ Pete's Place, Rebekah A. @ Lakeshore Pub, A E Robinson's convenience store, Poet and his missus @ Shaw's boarding house, All good folks. Will stop here again. Having problems downloading pictures from an SD card, so no pictures yet to show. Soon. Not much else. Getting rid of none essential gear and bringing the weight of the ruck down. We'll see.   ","Monson, ME

Waited this long, a little longer won't make that much of a difference. Thanks again to Phil Pepin, 100 mile wilderness for everything. I'll see you again my friend when the knee's are ready. Patience in all things, like the rocks, the tree's, and the snipers. All things come to those who wait.","Bangor, ME

Brigg's Farm for the annual blues fest this weekend. First time in many years. Maybe at the end of August. Time will tell. Still trying to figure out the photo shit. Later dudes and dudettes.

Vince ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548985,"Still getting over injuries. Making progress. Am thinking about picking up where I left off in Maine next May so I can use the winter to get in better shape and do most of the trail in one trek. See y'all in the spring. Delayed, but still determined.

Beautiful both times. My friend Phoebe went with me. Had a blast. Big, honkin' rocks and boulder's on the Bake Oven Knob side. Kinda reminded me of a mini-Katahdin. New journal for 2017 in the works. We'll see just how far my (non-existent) computer skill's can take me. See ya down the road. Vince","Coopersburg, PA
