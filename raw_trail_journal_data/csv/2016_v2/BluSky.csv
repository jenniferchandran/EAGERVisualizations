BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520713,"When you meet someone, if only for a brief moment in your lifetime, and you might not ever see them again...you pay attention. I rarely get the opportunity to meet someone who actually inspires me. Im fascinated with the possibilities at my age to find what truly makes me happy. Born and raised in Florida, I knew first hand what nature was all about. Over my life I have had the good fortune to see different areas of the Appalachian Mountains, but never Hiked them. ( unless you count hiking to the top of Lookout Mountain when I was 11) Not quite sure where all this will take me... so it begins.",,...WITH A SPARK...COMES FIRE...SO IT BEGINS...,"Feb 04, Thu",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520780,"... IM a newbie. So I know at this point I won't be able to do the whole trail. So I'm looking for the next best step. 10 days at a time. Im open to suggestion as to were to find the best 100 miles for me. Anything near a major airport is best, with transportion and lodging (inside bedding)... I have so much to learn.",,...taking the next step...,"Feb 05, Fri",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520796,Gotta get started on gear. Ive been reading Trail Journeys and Im just amazed. Im thinking the very 1st thing I need to buy is a really good pair of hiking boots and backpack. Thank goodness for the internet.,,My gear,"Feb 06, Sat",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520835,"...Im so ecstatic right now! Sometimes all you got to do is ask. Just taked with my oldest son Michael age 23. He told me that he has everything that I need to hike overnight. I am so happy, this is great news. Less gear I need to buy. Next question, ""would you like to hike with me?"" Michael, ""yes, I'll go with you."" Never in my wildest dreams...did I see that coming. March is marked. Birthday boy's first choice is Seattle(burr) second choice is Sedona. Fingers crossed... and the Air Force has not yet given him an enlistment date, he can join me on the Appalachian Trail in May. One happy mom!",,ECSTATIC,"Feb 07, Sun",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520922,"...In preparing for AT May2016... I gotta take any opportunity to explore, educate and just enjoy life.

BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520988,"In my attempt to fully prepare to hike a long distance...I found myself in a very unknown area....MY BODY. With little to no exercise over the last 30 years ( except the milage walked thru major cities...like NYC) I jump in head first 2 weeks ago, and remember myself as a tomboy growing up in Florida, and playing sports in High School. Well...I went about it all wrong...sigh. So I got my first ever full body massage at AZUL Dream Spa. My massage therapist is French, and has lived her life on almost every Continent (so cool). She was a world of infomation. So with that I will push forward in a different manner. Not a 100% right now, but I got this!",,Pushing Forward,"Feb 11, Thu",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521249,"I purchased a new laptop yesterday. After a couple of hours on YouTube, all I can say is ""WOW"" Bears, hygiene, food, weather and of course the People. But my favorite part is the determination express by those who dig deep within their soul to connect with the desirer that pushed them to the trail and their own personal happiness!",, A Virtual Tour,"Feb 16, Tue",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521609,I fear so very little in my life (except getting a rental car in a third world country) But I am challenging myself everyday to the stair climber. I want to be ready to hike elevation with no worries. Mt Rainier National Park is 24 days away. And then the AT will be a breeze.,,"""I'll take these footsteps, go higher...go higher""","Feb 22, Mon",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522269,"Watching for the second time Andrew Skurka ""Ultimate Hiking gear and skills clinic"" talks at Google. This time I'm taking notes. Even though some of it doesn't apply to me right now, all great information I can use down the road. Just two weeks away from Mount Rainer National Park, and it looks like I'm going to need warmer clothes. I'm a weather watcher, and its just not going to be as warm as I originally thought. oh well, can't control the weather. (In my profession for some strange reason people think that I do...ha). On a ""footnote""...I just had an awesome foot massage at Azul Dream Spa. Preparing Mind, Body and Soul!",,I'm taking notes,"Mar 02, Wed",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522391,"Just watched ""A Walk in the Woods"" with Nick Nolte and Robert Redford. It was Hilarious! Best part, when the bears come up on their campsite. Bryson, ""you pack a knife?"" Katz, ""NO"" Bryson, ""nothing sharp?"" Katz, ""nail clippers"" They were both in their 70's when they made the movie. As strong as I think I am!?!...Body and Mind (fiercely independent) Looks like more fun to hike with a partner.",,Hilarious,"Mar 03, Thu",0
BluSky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522887,"Back in the gym after a short hiatus to Bike Week Daytona Beach. Bike week has a way of sucking the life out of you, while you are distracted with none stop shananagins of fun. At least I got some exercise in with a bike ride on the beach. Also tested my ""living on the edge"" attitude, by riding on the back of motorcycle with no helmet (a first for me) On a sidenote...Thanks to Audioslave's ""Show me how to live"" I'm spending more time on the stairclimber.   And For those already hiking the AT, hang in there if you are tired. The rewards are endless.",,Biking!,"Mar 08, Tue",0
