That won't work on the AT.Wear a shoe that breathes    Many people believe that a waterproof shoe will keep their feet dry, but on a trail as long as this one, it's going to rain - a lot - any shoe is going to get wet. The more breathable the shoe, the faster it drys Blisters are something you have to live with So far, I have not experienced any foot problems. Besides wearing two pair of socks, I walk at a pace that does not inflame my feet, though it is hard to set a pace that feels too slow.So I am wearing Merrell Moab Ventilaters ankle high non waterproof with ininji toe socks and darn tough ankle socks over that.

I mentioned the trail story about training in gilet suits using the trail traffic as potential combatants - they didn't deny the possibility.

I have worked up to about 1.5 miles an hour with breaks, but because of the late start and high milage for the day, I had to pick it up a bit. The Pinnacle was followed by several miles of very rocky trail and my feet took a beating. I'm feeling good, and I thought it about time to test myself so I was determined to reach my goal.

So much for testing myself. Arrogance has suddenly turned into survival mode. With rain approaching, I doctored the blister and rummaged around for the pill bag. I belatedly recalled that resupply of yesterday was mysteriously missing this essential item. I have been taking ibuprofen everyday whether I need to or not and had only six advil left and twenty-five miles to go. The blister isn't an issue, but I am concerned with the left foot.

I'm making myself walk normally so as not to compromise some other weak link in this inadequately prepared body. My pace is barely a mile an hour, and it seems to take forever to cover the miles. Again, the rain is off and on today with the day's challenge being what is called The Knife's Edge. This is a stretch of ridge line that literally has you walking on top of rock that rises out of the ridge narrowing to less than a foot. The neighboring rock is well below knee high and though you would likely survive the fall, it would end your hike. Passed that test with flying colors, but when navigating through yet another boulder field, I slipped - my first and broke a pole. I use my hiking poles to set up the tent.

When I limped into Palmerton, I thought I'd get a hotel room. Of course the hotels are miles away from town, so when trying to find a shuttle, one kind woman who normally is available but who happens to be in Fort Bragg of all places mentioned Bert's. I figuratively jumped at the chance - his place only being a block from my location! Now for 10 bucks you get a garage and a semi private shower it being an afterthought tucked between the buildings.

Sitting on a park bench; it's like a settling, the ground pulling at you, the distant murmuring call to come home. I happened to be reading the journal entry of a young man who just pulled a thirty miler in ankle deep mud, up and down endless small rises we trail folk like to call PUDS - pointless up and downs - using duct tape to cover the sores on his feet.

I can feel the sole of my left foot separating from the foot like a blister but deeper.

My feet are really taking it. When I got there, I took a shower, washed the clothes I was wearing, and went looking for WiFi. There was a hotel about a mile away that has a bar, so I thought I'd have a beer and download the next set of maps. The place looked abandoned - inside a large sign reminded you that you had to be 21 to get a room... bar was closed. They sent me another mile to a different hotel, but the bridge you had to cross was under construction. Tired of this, I headed back only to run into a couple of other hikers.

Towards the late afternoon and I'm only about two hours from my goal for the day, I hear thunder. I've got a ridge to get over, so I check out where it's coming from and after a half hour figure I'm good to go. About half way up the ridge I hear an explosive bolt of lighting very near by, and the rain comes down as hard as I've ever seen. Somehow this cell came from a different direction and caught me by surprise. As I was huddling under my umbrella, an old hiker trudged by followed by a troop of teenagers while this unbelievable rain turning the trail into a stream continues. Well, I couldn't just sit there now hoping to wait it out, could I? On goes the poncho soaking me completely in the process. Got about five minutes down the trail and it stops.

That first day going 6.8 miles to the Ed Garvey Shelter required the hiking poles for leverage or else I wouldn't have been able to climb or desend the modest elevation changes. Since then I have faced a variety of challenges each contributing to my ability to succeed. Throughout May I have continually pushed the edge of doing more than I can handle because it's going to get a lot tougher soon. In critically evaluating my progress, I have been able to identify the vulnerable parts and address them. For the next few days I can back off and enjoy how special this journey is becoming.

I wear very thin black windbreaker pants that work great for keeping the tics off, but when I sweat, they tend to stick to my legs. I know the day will come when I have to stretch to reach the next step saving myself from a fall and rip the whole crotch out. I guess duct tape won't look so bad. You never know what the trail will be like from day to day, and as easy as today was, the last two miles were the most twisted up and down around this lake - even for the AT - that you just have to accept it is what it is.

For breakfast, I'll be having a bagel with peanut butter, lunch consists of salami and pita bread, and mashed potatoes and tuna packets with crushed kale chips for dinner. Snacks are toasted sunflower seeds, banana chips, fig bars, and dark chocolate. I've enjoyed an afternoon coffee with my new friends, so a little tub of Folgers crystals has become a staple.

When I got to the top of Killington at the end of the day, I checked my phone and found I had a couple of missed calls. It turned out that Chatterbox had twisted her ankle early on in the hike and had been taken to the hospital for x-rays to see if anything had broken.

This is the third night I've stayed in the shelters because of the weather, and it is hard to get an early start. Fortunately, I don't have far to go today. I have a resupply box at the post office in Manchester and will be staying at a hostel. I will be leaving the SNP today and entering the Blue Ridge Mountains. I am careful to take my pack on and off without twisting my back, and today it is light because I don't have much food, but I still somehow manage to pull a muscle somewhere. I'm in sorry shape and can't wait to get into town. Thankfully I only see rabbits and deer today. The bad weather hasn't let up, and the heat adds to my weary mood. When I get to the highway, I head over to a vendor like snack bar, but before I get there a guy in a pickup flags me over. He turns out to be a shuttle service and takes me to the post office and then to the hostel. This is a very friendly hiker town, but everything is miles apart and shuttles are nessesary to get around. Fortunately the town realizes this and there is a list of volunteers who are willing to do it for free. I think I'm going to take a couple days off, and hope that this weather pattern breaks.","Calf Mountain Hut

I'm taking this opportunity to go to the local outfitters to try yet another insole that might help my feet. I think I need some down time, and this hostel will be my oasis for a little while. Most everyone is leaving in the morning. We decide to have dinner at the nearby bar and grill, so six of us head the few blocks and enjoy some local ambiance.

I know I've got to get over my fear of thunder storms, but I'm not there yet. Apparently this is the pattern for the month, so I'm going to have to get over it. Besides, I forgot to mention that yesterday I helped Adam who owns Stanimals shuttle a hiker back to the trail. On the way back, I noticed that he only had an eighth of a tank of gas, and he was going to be out of town for a pickle ball tournament, (like mini tennis or really big ping pong), and had hikers scheduled for pickup in the afternoon. So I thought he'd like to have some gas instead of a night's charge. I pull up to the pump and of course the cap is on the other side. Now his car won't start, and I don't have his wife's number. He's not answering, so I find a tow company and arrange a tow back to his place. I guess I'll charge it, but he calls me back and wants me to use his guy. Now I have to cancel my tow and wait for his guy. Needless to say this takes a long time, so I don't count that day as a true zero.

I'd like to mention a piece of gear that has been priceless for me. I bought a sit pad that folds up and slides down the side of my pack. It weighs maybe three ounces and looks like a mini closed cell foam pad. Everyone touts the one made by the same company as the air mattress, and I did buy it, but I also got this one as a backup because it only cost $2.50 and weighs maybe two ounces. I ended up taking this one because it fits into the pack better. I use this all the time. It keeps my seat warm and dry, but especially cushioned.

Of course the thunder didn't get here till evening, but I let it rock me to sleep. I'm sleeping in shelters more frequently because of the constant chance of rain. I have found many uses for my trekking poles. Besides being the supports for my tent and of course pushing me up and slowing me down on steep sections, I have found other invaluable uses for them. When you are the first one on the trail, you encounter many spider webs formed overnight. There is one spider, though I have yet to actually see it, that feels like you just walked into an electric fence. I think it vibrates its web when it feels threatened so fast that you think you're getting some kind of shock when it lands on your face. The first time this happened to me, I lost both poles clawing away at it I was so suprised. The hiking poles come to the rescue. If swung up as you walk they will catch them before your face does. Also they can be twirled in the air when horse flies come in for the kill.

The Grayson Highlands are famous for their wild ponies, excellent views, and challenging terrain. I want to get to the shelter early because the cloud formations could be spectacular. My feet are not happy with the pace and the rocks, but I manage to maintain two miles an hour the whole day arriving at the shelter by 1:30 in the afternoon and still had time to visit with the ponies getting some photos. I spend the rest of the day enjoying the views and giving my feet a rest. I hope the pictures of the sunset come out as I remember it.","Old Orchard Shelter

Rockever,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547673,"It's going to be an easy day with a lot of down hill miles. I can tell the weather is going to take a turn for the worst because the clouds are forming early. I haven't had any reception for a few days now, and I'm a little worried about the hurricane that was supposed to be headed this way. Finally the trail is smoother, but the damage is done. I'll be taking a zero when I get to Damascus tomorrow and give them a rest. Half way down a thunderstorm chases me off of a barren rocky knob back into the woods. I'm not in a hurry, so I arrive at the shelter after three and have a decision to make. There is a hiker at the shelter that goes by Last Steve because he is the last of his buddies still on the trail. In a couple of miles the AT connects to the Virginia Creeper Trail which goes all the way to Damascus. If you stay on this trail you know it will be smooth and flat the whole way into town because it used to be a railroad that follows a small river. I'm tempted to continue, but it is 14 more miles. Doing so will probably be my last chance at a marathon day for this hike. The weather is quickly deteriorating with the sky growing dark. My feet make the decision to stay an easy choice. Last Steve turns out to be great company and though the rain and thunder continues into the night, we manage to keep a fire going.","Thomas Knob Shelter

I'm ready for some time off and can't wait to get into town. If I stay on the AT, the trail will have lots of little ups and downs, but if I use the Creeper Trail I know it will be smooth and flat into town. Not knowing what the weather will be like, and wanting to be in town as soon as possible, I opt for the easier path. The Creeper Trail is very popular and known to be beautiful. It lives up to its reputation and I'm glad I've made the decision to hike it even though I'll be bypassing a portion of the AT. As has happened so many times, I'm a couple miles out of town when a huge thunderstorm catches me and I am walking through several inches of water, but I don't care. Chuck who runs Woodchuck Hostel has a great place, with many options like a teepee, cabin, and bunkhouse as well as beds inside the main house. With all the recent rain, I choose a bed in the house. I've had my supply box sent here so I'm all set for a well deserved break. I'll be using the time to figure out the next 470 miles which should take about 40 days to complete and this will be my last big break before I'm done.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Many hostels include breakfast in the price of a night's stay, and waffles are often on the menu. They are high in calories with the fruit, syrup, and butter you get to slather all over them. Chuck's are the best I've had so far. Today is going to be a busy day for me because I'm planning out the rest of the trip to pinpoint the flight reservation to get me home. With 470 miles to go, I figure it will take me forty days to complete the hike. I'm also having the guys back home do an inventory of supplies I prepared before the hike to see if I have enough to finish. Also I'm trying to gain some weight back, so I think I'm going to take an extra zero.","Woodchuck Hostel, Damascus

While I've been here, Chuck has been teaching me how to play corn hole. This is a very popular game here in the south. The rules are simple; toss a beanbag at a slanted backboard that has a hole in it. It's a bit like horseshoes, but you don't have to dedicate a piece of your yard as you can pick it up and put it away when you're done. I think I'll have to make one for us when I get back.

I arrive early enough to take my time with the camp chores. There's a couple of guys doing a section already at the shelter. Now that I use the shelters more often, I'm not shy about asking if anyone snores. One of them does so it's going to be the tent tonight.

I'm going over the schedule, and I notice that I made an error in addition and have ten more miles to do this stretch before my next supply drop. One thing I've learned is that you have to be flexible - something always comes up. I'm looking at the map trying out alternatives to get back on track, and it's going to be tough because I'm not exactly taking it easy when I mapped it out in the first place.

It's a little nerve racking when you see notices posted at every road crossing and campsite saying, ""no camping, picnicking, or lingering"". What exactly constitutes ""lingering ""? In any case I'm busting this day's milage out. Fortunately there is a new hostel that just opened up this spring right where I need it. Talking to hikers you meet coming from where you're going often yields invaluable information because I wouldn't have known about Boots Off otherwise. It's a nice spot located perfectly, and I'm safe from the bears for another night. Today's hike is hard with rocky trail and my feet are done for the day.","Iron Mountain Shelter

Rocky parts continue which makes the locals happy - rugged goes well with a day hike - but my feet ache after a few miles. This stretch has me gaining elevation all day, and I'm really having to push. Also the water sources are becoming unreliable as the summer fades to fall. I passed four 'good sources' that were dry before I found one big enough before I could stop for the night.

It's not as efficient, but I get an early start so I guess it'll work out. Finally the weather pattern starts to change, and though it's still nice the humidity is back. I end the day with a really hard climb which I know will still leave a third left for the morning. I'm starting to worry about water as I pass each dry stream and spring during my climb. I finally reach one that shows promise and manage to coax a quart but this takes twenty minutes and I'm running out of daylight. At least if Doll Flats spring is dry, I'll have enough water if I don't cook to get me over the top. What a beautiful site it was when I get there and it's flowing strong.

I can't count on the regular water sources anymore, but I'm able to hike farther now between them. One of the first things I do is boil water for breakfast and coffee because my boil bag rice takes a half hour to reconstitute and I have coffee and a smoke while I wait. There is a meadow below the trees where I've camped, and as I watch the dawn begin to lighten the meadow a ciyotee (sic) passes through. It stops half way to look in my direction, then from where it came. I remain still and it sits down. This standoff lasts for a long moment before it silently moves on. I look away for a second and its mate has followed, both disappearing into the woods. I'm glad there were only two. Today is full of expansive views from Hump and Little Hump Mountains. Both are treeless giving a spectacular 360 of the mountains around me. I end the day on Roan Mountain at the highest shelter on the AT surrounded by a spruce forest.

She's been running her hostel for many years out of her house. Over the years she's added on a bunkhouse, but now I can see she's on the last whole in her belt and if things don't change, next year will probably be her last. One of her challenges is the steep half mile down to the hostel. I was grumbling by the time I got there. My mood doesn't improve when I find out the post office has messed up another shipment, and the supplies haven't arrived.

I bought some chicken and potatoes last night, and one of the guys is going to cook them for dinner over the fire. Conny, the owner, has a large fire pit in her yard for the hikers to use. Every hostel I've been to has one. The food tastes better than it looks. While thats going on, the tank for water that supplies the house runs out.

It doesn't help that she is very strict with hand washing before touching anything. I spend much of the morning and afternoon trying to get the water going. The fact is the system is old and things need to be replaced. By the time the postman arrives I'm ready to go. I still have to sort and pack, and it is after four in the afternoon before I leave - facing the dreaded half mile just to get back on the trail. Needless to say it is a low mileage day.
