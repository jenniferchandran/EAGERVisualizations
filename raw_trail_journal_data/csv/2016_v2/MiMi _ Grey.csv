MiMi & Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526662,Well here is a little back story... My name is MiMi ( haven't come across a suitable trail name yet) and my husband is Kevin ( Grey). My husband has wanted to walk the trail for quite a few years but for various reasons never thought he would be able to. Over the last year or so I came to the realization that I wanted to do it too. Fast forward to last September and we are on Springer mountain starting a section hike (not able to take the extended time from work to thru hike but want to do it). Optimistic but scared as hell about not being able to do this.Neither one of us have ever hiked before but what the hell it's just walking...right?,"

MiMi & Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526664,So it's about 10:00 on a Friday morning. After an awesome and hilarious ride from a wonderful woman named Sally who is retired ( Sally and Joyce run a hiker taxi service and they are awesome!)we arrived at the base of Springer Mountain. It's misting but we are ready. Up a mile and a half to the terminus we go! Now it begins.As always on the first day we started flying down the trail. Excited and feeling invincible we walk. The mist is steadily turning in to rain. The trail has become a mini river and along with the water we watch our hopes of dry feet just wash away. Welcome to Georgia hurricane Joachim!,"

MiMi & Grey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526668,"If ignorance is bliss then we should have been ecstatic about not knowing that a hurricane was reaching the Atlantic Coast while we were starting our journey. Oh well we are here and we will walk. Our goal for the day(I mean my husband's because he is the researcher, navigator and time keeper on this trip) was Horse Gap. It's about 10.5 miles in and fairly respectable for two middle aged people who have never done anything like this before. Like I said...it was a goal. We managed to get to the ridge above Horse Gap just in time for the sun to go down before we set up camp. At this point it is pouring down rain and we have been soaked for hours. All we want is to lay down in something dry. All the practice in your backyard setting up your hammocks and tarps doesn't help much when it's dark and you are trying to find 2 sets of trees that will work.","
