Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/407756,"Preparation is going swimmingly. I'll be going as light as possible. I have completed the Shenandoah National Park section and the Roan Mountain section with Elliott, my son. This time Sonny Boy will be in school, so I'll be hiking with Oscie, my Brittany. She completed the Roan Mountain section with us, so is something of a veteran. I have been riding my bike and climbing stairs in preparation for the hike, but know from past experience that that will be woefully inadequate for a Florida boy. Oh well, one does what one can.","Springer Mountain

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/412028,"This year I will be trying a new hiking diet. Since I am never hungry when hiking, I will be using products from Hammer Nutrition to fuel me during the day. These products are used by athletes (runners, bikers, etc.) as a convenient source of fuel during long distance events. The products I will be using are: Perpetuem Powder (add water) - Protein, carbohydrate, fat mix for balanced nutrition; Hammer Gel - Carbohydrate gel for energy boost; Fizz - Electrolyte tab (add to water) for hydration; Hammer Bars - balanced nutrition (something to chew); Recoverite (add water) - Protein, carbohydrate, L-glutamine, antioxidant, electrolyte mix for muscle recovery and prevention of lactic acid build-up. In addition, I will eat a hot meal in the evening. I have various meals cooked by my wife (thanks, Jenny), which I then dehdrated. I think that this will be a fairly complete diet and has the added benefit of being very light in weight. Stay tuned for trail reports on expected condition of health and happiness, or, alternatively, a possible near-death experience.","

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/418279,"On Sunday,we got up early at my brother's house near Clarkesville GA and headed for the hills. We found USFS 42 without too much trouble and made our way up to Big Stamp Gap, arriving at about 8:30. The thermometer on Sam's truck read 46 degrees. Oscie (rhymes with Posse) and I put on our packs and headed south for Springer Mountain. After a cool and pleasant hike, we arrived at the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. The sun was just breaking through the morning haze as we stepped out onto the overlook. We dutifully signed the roster in the drawer under the rock and took pictures along with another couple, both humans, who were already there. Then, we headed back the way we had come. During the next few hours of hiking I used all of the products from Hammer Nutrition as planned, even though I never experienced any hunger or desire to eat. We arrived at Hawk Mountain Shelter mid-afternoon and set up our little camp before anyone else arrived. Others began to trickle in during the afternoon and evening, and before it was over, we must have numbered 12 or 15. There was all the usual chatter around our small camp fire - previous hikes, gear, what lay ahead, etc. I ate Jenny's Spaghetti and Oscie ate her re-hydrated meal, even though she seemed dog-tired. I let Oscie get into the hammock since it was supposed to drop int the thirties during the night; normally, she sleeps on her own bed. We were cozy but a little crowded in my ultra-lite hammock. I think Oscie slept better than I did.","Big Stamp Gap
",Hawk Mountain Shelter,"May 12, Sun",9.10
Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/418973,"Today was another day of cool weather, great for hiking. We hiked over Sassafras and Justus Mountains. Both were steep but not too high. Oscie is a different dog on the trail, giving those we happen upon a wide berth. She is very wary.
We arrived at Gooch Mountain Shelter in the mid-afternoon. We could have gone farther, but it seemed wise to take it easy for now, since the map showed some hard hiking ahead. Many of the same hikers came wandering into camp as the day wore on. Most had acquired or chosen trail names - Joker & Shutterbug, Glider, Turtle, Steady Betty, Stripper, Winnie, Giant Bear, Slow Roller, and Mouse were some of them. I had heard rumors of a hiker named Maytag who carried a refrigerator sized backpack as well a front pack, for counterbalance I suppose. There are pictures of many of these characters in my photo section. 
I ate some of Jenny's Chili for dinner and then retired for the evening. Since the night was turning rapidly colder, I had company in the hammock again.","Hawk Mountain Shelter
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"May 13, Mon",7.70
Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419006,"Oscie and I hiked the day away the way we always do - alone. Everyone leaves camp at different times each morning, so I suppose everyone else does the same. We crossed over Big Cedar Mountain, which was the steepest climb yet, by far. At one point, we rounded a bend in the trail and came upon a young man standing in the shade by a stream. He said that he had become extremely overheated and dehydrated. He said that he felt better now, but that he had been hallucinating. I gave him a couple of electrolyte tablets to put in his water and moved on. He said that his name was Maytag.   We set up camp at Lance Creek, which had good water and campsites. We shared a nice fire and chatted the evening away pleasantly. I decided to get up and away early since Blood Mountain lay ahead and the day was expected to be the warmest yet. Blood Mountain is the highest mountain on the AT in Geogia, so I intended to get most of the climbing done before the heat. Company again in the hammock - I fear I have created a monster.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Lance Creek,"May 14, Tue",8.50
Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419022,"We got up early, as planned, and packed up by the light of the headlamp. We were on the trail as dawn was breaking. The hike up Blood Mountain was not as difficult as I expected it to be, although, we did nothing but climb for most of three hours. It was nice to come around a small bend and see the shelter standing there, as it had done since 1934. We stripped off our packs and proceeded to enjoy the view from the overlook. Fifteen or twenty minutes later, Glider came gliding in. We made coffee and climbed up to the big overlook above the shelter. It was a very enjoyable moment - good coffee, good view, and good company.
We parted ways and headed down the other side of Blood Mountain a few minutes apart. The descent was steep and I proceeded slowly, in order to take it easy on my knees. It was beginning to get hot and I felt for those who were probably toiling up the mountain on the other side. When I arrived at Neels Gap, Glider was already sitting there enjoying a well earned rest. I spent the next couple of hours washing laundry, showering, and wandering around the outfitters store that was there. I picked up the care package that I had sent to their mail drop and refilled my food bag. Then, I bought a hot dog for myself and one for Oscie. They were good. 
I was clean, repacked, and had recharged my phone when the next wave of hikers came stumbling in from Blood Mountain. They were sweating profusely and looked completely exhausted. Note to self - Get up early more often. Everyone else decided to stay in the hostel, but Oscie and I moved on. She didn't want to stay in the kennel.
We had been climbing for about an hour (already sweaty again), when we happened upon a hiker hustling along the trail. He told me that his father was up the trail a ways, exhausted. He said that he was going after more water so that they could make it through the night. He told me that his father was a pastor and asked me to look in on him.
We had hiked for another hour or so when we came upon the pastor lying on the iside of the trail with his hat over his face.
""How are you doing Pastor?"" I asked.
""I'm okay, I just need some rest,"" he said, from under the hat.
""Do you need some water?""
""No, I'm fine."" He peered out from under the hat.
""Pretty dog,"" he said.
We moved on and camped alone.","Lance Creek

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419081,"We proceeded on to Low Gap Shelter, spending the day going up and down, up and down, repeat. The camping area was spacious with stream access in multiple spots. I was warned away from the privy by Shutterbug, who said I didn't want to go there. Also in camp were Joker, Giant Bear, Glider, Turtle. Mouse, Steady Betty and Tall No Name.   Oscie seemed tired and was walking around in quite a gingerly fashion - her feet were beginning to bother her from walking on all the rocks. Some of the others asked whether she was alright. She was becoming something of a fixture among them and they were concerned about her. I figured a good nights sleep in the hammock might do her some good and briefly considered sleeping on her bed myself.","Swaim Gap
",Low Gap Shelter,"May 16, Thu",8.60
Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419089,"In the morning Oscie felt like a new woman. She was zooming all over the place, chasing critters, digging, and generally having a high time. Joker said her recovery showed that she was a real trooper and he gave her the trail name Trooper. The day's hike was generally level and it was nice to have a day of easy hiking with Tray Mountain coming up. It was to be the last night for some of our party (Joker, Shutterbug, Glider, Turtle, and Steady Betty), as they had to get back to their former lives after reaching Unicoi Gap. There were some others, sort of new to our camp, who would end up taking their places for a time. Sleepwalker, and Chuck Wagon were two hikers who had started later than we had, but had caught up to us in time because of the miles they were covering. Chuck Wagon received his trail name around our camp fire that night for the 20 lb. bag of food that he was carrying in addition to his backpack.   A young guy named Ian was trying to do the trail in about 100 days. He would have to cover 23+ miles daily in order to accomplish that feat. He had no stove and intended to eat ""snacks"" the whole way. There were also three fellows from somewhere up north, Illinois, I think. Good luck to all.","Low Gap Shelter
",Blue Mountain Shelter,"May 17, Fri",7.30
Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419136,"It rained much of the night, and we arose to a morning of dense fog. We descended Tray Mountain in the fog, mist, and sometime rain. The trail was slippery, but the hike was cool and enjoyable. When we reached Unicoi Gap, we said our good-byes to those who were already there waiting for their rides, took final pictures, and headed up out of the gap. We slowly reeled in Rocky Mountain and then Tray Mountain, walking in the fog all day long. The view from the top of Tray Mountain was supposed to be spectacular - I guess it was, in its own way, if you like fog.
We arrived at the Tray Mountain Shelter after a long and exhausting hike. I was thankful that the day had been cool at least. We set up camp and immediately began gathering up material, all of it wet, to make a fire. The fire making turned into something of a community project. We lit a fire under a small mound of damp twigs, with the help of a little alcohol. Sleep Walker, Chuck Wagon and I took turns keeping a small flame alive, with our constant blowing. Others gathered up a nice sized pile of firewood. After a very long time, we had a small fire going, and then a larger one; one that stayed alive by itself. The fire cheered up what was, otherwise, a grey and dreary day. 
A trail runner, named Razor, showed up at our camp and kept everyone entertained with his many trail tales. He was an interesting fellow, but Trooper and I were worn out, so we turned in early. We drifted off to sleep listening to the sounds of trail talk and laughter around the fire that we had worked so hard to kindle. It was very rewarding.","Blue Mountain Shelter
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"May 18, Sat",8.10
Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419179,"It poured all night again, so in the morning the fire pit was just a soggy, blackened, remnant of its former lively self. Trooper and I waited to pack up while it poured some more. The more hardy souls packed up and moved out in the rain. Once we got going, we walked in foggy, wet conditions for a second day. The going was not too tough until we reached Kelly Knob, and then we had a very steep climb indeed. There were actually about two level steps at the top before the trail went back down sharply. At the very bottom, we found Deep Gap Shelter and Giant Bear. It was good to see him again after losing sight of him for a few days. He had pushed himself too hard and was resting his knees with a zero day. I think he was glad to see us too, particularly Trooper. While we were at Neels Gap he had come out of the store smiling, something in his hand. Then, he opened his hand to proudly reveal a rubber ball he had bought for Trooper. I put it in her backpack for a keepsake from Giant Bear, and she still has it now, a thoughtful memento from her hike. We camped there with two others, whose names I can not remember, and who, the next day, walked out of our lives just as quickly as they had walked in. That is life on the trail.","Tray Mountain Shelter
",Deep Gap Shelter,"May 19, Sun",7.40
Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419191,"We left camp fairly early in the morning. At least, we left before Giant Bear. We said our good-byes, in case we didn't see each other again down the trail. We hadn't hiked too long until we saw a sign along the side of the trail that read ""Vista."" We hiked on for a few minutes and then I decided that, since we had hiked all the way up there, we should at least take the time to see a vista. I'm glad we did. We turned back, walked up the clearly marked side trail and saw one of the most beautiful sights we had seen since starting the trail - mountains as far as we could see, with banks of clouds nestled in between. There was a lake, name unknown, shimmering in the morning light. I wish now that we had taken the time to make a cup of coffee, and sit awhile. We descended into Dicks Creek Gap and met two men unpacking their gear from a car.    ""A man and a dog,"" one of them said, stating the obvious.   ""Yep,"" I said.    ""A guy came through here not long ago,"" he continued, ""asked if we had seen a man and a dog.""   Giant Bear. He had obviously passed by us when we were at the Vista.   "" Thanks,"" I said, and we moved on down the trail.  Trooper and I walked into Plumorchard Gap Shelter pretty late in the day. It looked like we were going to be alone for the evening, so I put up my hammock inside the shelter in order to avoid putting up my tarp. Of course, another hiker, Argo, came walking up just as soon as we had gotten settled in. She told us that we were not in the way, and she set up her sleeping area against the wall, near where someone had taken the time to install the plastic cover plate to a wall socket. Funny. We chatted, like you do on the trail, while we prepared our dinners. She was a surgical nurse who worked at the Cleveland Clinic. She had been overseas, to Dubai I think, in her capacity as a nurse. She had put all that aside for a time, in order to fulfill her dream of walking the trail. I hope that it is all that she hoped it would be. Checking the register, I found that Winnie had passed through a day or two before. Go Winnie!  I planned to let Trooper sleep on her bed under my hammock. I told Argo to let me know if Trooper bothered her during the night, and, if so, I would put her in the hammock. I heard the rustling of some critter during the night, but nothing else.","Deep Gap Shelter
",Plumorchard Gap Shelter,"May 20, Mon",8.10
Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/419202,"I awoke in the morning at first light. I invited Trooper up into the hammock for a pre-hike snuggle, as is our custom when she sleeps outside on her bed. After awhile, I went to fill our water bottles, and when I returned, Argo was up and packing. She said that Trooper had come over during the night, and slept alongside her. I gathered that she didn't mind.  Once Argo had gone, I took a long hard look at the map. It seemed as if we could make it to Deep Gap, if we hiked hard. The trail ascended over 2,000' during the next ten miles, with barely a step downhill until the final descent into the gap. Oh well, we would hike hard.  The day was warmer than usual, hot, really. We pushed on, mile after mile, until finally, we arrived at the tree that held a sign which read, simply, ""NC/GA."" A little farther on, we happened upon the famous Gnarled Tree. What a pair of milestones! I felt very gratified, but a lot of trail still lay ahead, so, after a couple of brief photo-ops, we got back to work.   I tried, intermittently, to reach my brother on the phone. There was no signal, and my battery was nearly spent. I tried again and again as we hiked, quickly turning off my phone between attempts. Finally, at the very highest point above Deep Gap, we made contact. His voice sounded so good, I can not tell you. It's funny - once I had made my mind up to quit the trail, it became an all-consuming passion. I didn't want to spend another night on the trail ... and I wasn't going to have to.  Trooper and I descended into Deep Gap, and set up the hammock one last time, to relax while we waited for Sam to arrive. We napped happily for awhile, and then heard the crunching of gravel as Sam's truck rolled up.   ""Come on, Oscie,"" I said, ""let's go home.""","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/421978,"I wanted to make one last entry for those who might have been interested in the nutritional aspect of my hike. As stated earlier, I completed my hike using nothing for nutrition except products from Hammer Nutrition and homemade dehydrated meals (also ate 1 hotdog at Mountain Crossings). All in all, I was extremely happy and well satisfied with what was certainly a minimalist type diet. Let me say though, that, I can and do survive on just about anything, even at home. So this may not be the diet for picky or voracious eaters. 
My usual day went something like this: I had two small plastic jars into which I divided my daily supply of Perpetuem (based on the recommendation from Hammer Nutrition for my body weight). I added water to one of the jars for sipping on throughout the morning. The other jar was for afternoon use, so I did not add water to it until then. I usually used different flavors for morning and afternoon to add a little variety. I found the Perpetuem to be very tasty, and it completely satisfied my need to eat throughout the day. Even though I was not hungry, I usually ate a couple of HN's energy bars each day - normally one for breakfast and one for lunch. For hydration, I added a Fizz electrolyte tablet to each quart sized bottle of water that I drank. The flavors were very mild and pleasing, and also added a little fizz to the water, which was refreshing. I really think the tablets helped with my hydration needs, and after getting ""bear caught"" the previous year, I believe that they (or some other electrolyte mix) are a wise addition to any hikers arsenal. For quick energy, I bought the Hammer Gel in bulk bottles and re-packaged into individual packets ( I saved used packets of drink mixes that my kids use, re-filled with Hammer Gel, and heat sealed with my daughter's hair straightener). Usually, during a tough climb, I would make a small hole in one end of the packet, put the packet in my mouth like stogie, and nurse on it for ten or fifteen minutes as I climbed. That turned out to be a great way to keep my energy level up for an extended period. Finally, after the day's hike was done I would drink a mixture of Recoverite before setting up camp and preparing one of Jenny's dehydrated meals.
This hikers diet may not be for everyone, but I think that most hikers could tailor at least some of these products to their own needs. I certainly am not trying to convince anyone to use any of my techniques for hiking light, but am just putting this out there for what it is worth - I hope someone will benefit. At any rate, as each season goes by, I am learning more and more to HMOH.","

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441428,"Oscie and I are beginning the always exciting process of preparing for our next stretch of the AT.   With Oscie's help, I have been repackaging all of the Hammer products into individual servings from their bulk containers and dehydrating and packaging meals. Oscie is good about cleaning up anything that might come her way by way of fumble. She's very thoughtful like that. This year I decided to change my meals from 5 ounces to 4 ounces since it was hard to finish some of my meals last year. I will start dehydrating Oscie's food next and then we will be all but ready. Believe it or not, I was satisfied with all of my gear last year, so I will not be making any major purchases this year. Hallelujah! The final step will be to see what I carried last year that I can do without this year. I will shave every last ounce that I can and am looking forward to the lightest backpack ever.

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/459753,"Oscie and I spent the night at bro' Sam's house where we had a good meal and night of rest. We got up early and drove up to last year's end point at Deep Gap, arriving at 8:30. Oscie and I said our good-byes and started north up the Trail. The morning was cool, and once we got out of the gap, sunny - a beautiful beginning. We hiked the morning away happily, but by noon I was already starting to feel the aches that are characteristic of the break-in process (or is it the break-down process?) of hiking on the Trail. I had developed a nagging ache in my right hip that throbbed with every step. I decided a break was in order, and quickly set up the hammock. In a few minutes Oscie and I were fast asleep... Ahh, the joy of hammocking. A quick power nap was just what the doctor ordered and before long we were back at it, minus the aching hip. By late afternoon, we were setting up our first camp near the Carter Gap Shelter and going about all of the housekeeping processes so familiar to all who hike. Others came trickling in over the next couple of hours and did the same. Oscie made friends with a Bassett Hound named Lilly while I chatted with some young men who were attempting a thru-hike.

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471282,"We packed up and left Carter Gap Shelter by around 8:30. After hiking for about an hour, we happened upon a little side trail that led to a nice overlook, so we settled in for a light breakfast of coffee and oatmeal. I was enjoying the view, when I looked down to see that my coffee bag was on fire. Oscie seemed unruffled by the ensuing hubbub and observed serenely, as if everything were going according to some unknowable plan. Well, these things happen, and when they do, it's nice not to have to look around to see whether someone else saw you. I robbed the coffee from another day's rations, and we had a nice breakfast, with a view. We hiked on uneventfully for another five miles or so, when, high up through the trees, the observation tower on Albert Mountain came into view. When we arrived at the mountain's base, I could see the white blazes going up the side of a pretty sheer rock face, a very unusual sight. I began to climb cautiously, pulling myself up using rocks and sometimes the trunks of the stunted trees that were attempting to grow in the rock. Oscie bounded from rock to rock like a mountain goat, occasionally looking down from some perch, wondering what the hold-up was, no doubt. I can say without reservation, the climb up Albert Mountain was the most difficult stretch of trail (if you want to call it that) I had yet covered; but the view from the observation tower made it all worthwhile.    We hiked the afternoon away on a relatively easy section of trail. Somewhere along the way, I missed my exit to Long Branch Shelter, so we hiked on a few more miles and camped alone in a nice spot.    On the continuing battle with Oscie as to whether she would spend the night under the hammock on her bed, or spend it in the hammock with me: The night was clear and cool, so I thought that she would be just fine on her own bed, and that I could enjoy an uncrowded night in the hammock. Therefore, I rebuffed her repeated attempts to get in the hammock, pointing her to her bed. Then I zipped up the mosquito net, settling in comfortably. After awhile, I eased up on one elbow and peeked out. She was sitting outside of the tarp staring directly at the spot where I was peeking out. I scolded her, and made her get back on her bed. When I peeked out again, there she was, sitting and staring, as if saying, ""Surely there must be some mistake."" I was getting really tired of this game, so I decided to let her sit there all night if that's what it took to teach her a lesson. I was lying there, fighting the urge to look out again, when, through the hammock, I felt a chin rest gently on my shoulder... Game, Set, Match!","Carter Gap Shelter

I didn't want to go on the long downhill trudge to Siler Bald Shelter, but that was where the water was, so down we went. We ran into the water source some distance before the shelter, which we could see through the trees. It sounded raucous at the shelter, so we watered up and headed back up the hill. After some time, we came upon a side trail that led to Siler Bald. I was ready to camp by this point but decided to go up for the view, which was one of my better decisions ... the view was breathtaking in all directions. I ran into a hiker there who other hikers referred to as the ""Rock Lady"", but I can not remember her actual trail name.

He was hiking with his teenaged daughter Ellie. ""Actually,"" he said, ""I don't remember you... I remember your dog."" I get that a lot.    We hiked on to Cold Spring Shelter, one of the few shelters that sits right in the middle of the Trail. It was early enough that we had time to make a fire and have some pleasant conversation well into the evening. In addition to those named above, I met Ghost, Critter, and Yogi Bear.    Ghost, Tribe, and I went to a camping area a little way away from the shelter and set up - Ghost in a tent, and Tribe and I in hammocks.

The fog was so thick that we didn't bother climbing the observation tower. After all, who wants a better view of fog? We sat down on the new grass under the tower and ate our lunch before heading out.    Late that afternoon, after a very long and very slippery descent (I fell down twice), Oscie and I hiked into the NOC. We were just approaching the NOC Outfitters store when Tribe came hurrying toward us with a big smile on his face.    ""C'mon,"" he said, ""We've got a cabin and you and Oscie are staying with us. I don't think dogs are allowed, but nobody'll know.""    This did not seem to violate my personal policy of following every rule that I agree with, so we followed him obediently. The cabin was very nice and quite comfortable. We had a full house with Tribe, Morgan & Elizabeth, Ghost, Oscie, and me - very cozy.     We all cleaned up and walked down to meet Mark and Ellie, and have some dinner at the River's End Restaurant on the Nantahala River. I tied Oscie to a post outside the entrance of the restaurant and we got a table where we could see her through the window. Part way through our meal, someone noticed that Oscie had committed an unladylike indiscretion upon the sidewalk. I went outside to check on her and knew immediately that she was not feeling well - she seemed lethargic and disoriented. By the time we got back to the cabin she was walking wobbly and her hind end did not seem to be getting instructions from the front end.

I spent the day doing laundry, eating pizza, snoozing, and reading. I also went down and confessed to having Oscie in the cabin (which was allowed after all) and paid her fee. I bought some shampoo and gave Oscie a bath in the bathtub (probably not allowed) and she spent most of the day in the bed (probably not allowed either). I repacked after picking up my care package from the NOC Outfitters store and we looked forward to getting back on the Trail in the morning.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471348,"We hit the Trail early on fresh legs, and it sure felt good. We climbed the 3,000' out of Nantahala Gorge without much trouble, stopping for lunch and water at Sassafras Gap Shelter. We arrived just as it started raining again, so we stayed for over an hour until the rain had subsided some. While waiting, I looked at the shelter journal and saw that Ghost had checked in the previous day, commenting wearily on a difficult climb. He had not had the benefit of fresh legs, as we had, and it made me thankful that we had taken a timely zero day. A few minutes later another pair of hikers came in. They were just out for a couple of days and were in high spirits. Then, three more young guys came in looking for a respite from the rain. One of them was hiking in flip-flops. Both toenails on his big toes were black and he had duct tape on his feet under the straps. I can only imagine the number of times he must have stubbed his toes on the rocks and roots that are the daily impediments to every hiker. I predict hiking shoes in his future.    After the rain let up some, Oscie and I continued our climb to Cheoah Bald, which was another magnificent view of fog. It didn't take us long to look at that, and then we were off again. We made the slow and slippery trek down to Locust Cove Gap, where we set up camp in a misting rain. I was preparing to cook my dinner when I made a startling discovery... I did not have my penny stove. I hadn't missed it before because we had been eating prepared meals at the NOC. It was like losing an old friend. I had made it years ago and it had been on every hike I had made on the AT. Thinking back, I believe I must have left it at Cold Spring Shelter, which was the last meal I had cooked. I guess Critter ended up with my stove, at least I hope he did. It looked like I would have to eat my pasta with cold water for the rest of the hike. Looking at the bright side - it didn't take long to make dinner...Mmmm, crunchy! We ate and then turned in, listening to the patter of rain all night.","NOC - Zero Day

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471352,"In the morning, it seemed like the bad weather had moved out, so after breakfast, we headed north, expecting to spend one last night on the Trail at the day's end. Most of the hiking was not too difficult, until we reached ""Jacob's Ladder"", an ascent which you almost need a ladder to climb. The slickness of the Trail made the climb slow going, but, you adapt to the conditions and just slog along.     A little farther on, we ran into a young man who had set up a portable photo table on which he was taking pictures of salamanders. He said that he worked for National Geographic and that he was photographing the Cheoah Salamander, which could only be found along that particular stretch of the Appalachians. He took one out of his sample jar and showed it to me. It was a salamander all right. Oscie and I had hiked for another couple of hours when we came across a newt scuttling along the Trail. I picked it up and admired it...It put the salamander to shame.    Late that afternoon, we arrived at Cable Gap Shelter. It was an ancient and tiny shelter. The four youngsters who were already there filled it to capacity. Oscie and I went down the hill a ways and set up near the creek that was the shelter's water source. Then we walked back up to socialize a bit. The college aged kids who were there already had a nice fire going, so we helped them enjoy it. Oscie received the attention that she craves and I was mesmerized by watching each of the kids, in turn, plumbing the mysteries of a harmonica that one of them had bought for the occasion. It seemed that no recognizable tune could be coaxed out of it, except for something faintly resembling Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. Before long, they lost interest in the harmonica, and began a lively debate about whether or not they should play cards, and if so, which game. There seemed to be no resolution forthcoming, so, duly entertained, Oscie and I returned to our sanctuary and drifted off to the more comforting sound of trickling water","Locust Cove Gap

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471355,"We arose early, well rested and keenly aware that this would be our last day on the Trail. By the time we got back up to the shelter, we just caught a glimpse of the foursome disappearing around a nearby bend in the Trail. I decided to take a quick look at the shelter journal. Tribe had left a note saying that he had camped there the night before. It's good, for some reason, to see a familiar name when you are out in the middle of nowhere. I glanced at the sleeping platform as I was leaving, and there, lying abandoned, was the recalcitrant harmonica.    The morning was beautiful and the hiking easy. After some considerable time, I began to see the waters of Fontana Lake through the trees. The lake looked cool and inviting, but was inaccessible due to the steepness of the trailside. The nearness of our destination caused time to drag on and on and it seemed we would never reach the dam, our end point. Finally, we burst out into the open, and there, not far away, stood the Fontana Hilton, renowned as one of the most luxurious shelters on the Trail. We sloughed off our packs and rested there for a bit, and it was a fine shelter indeed. Feeling a great sense of accomplishment, we ambled down the paved road to the Fontana Dam Visitor's Center, which was closed. A few sightseers wandered about, walking out on the road that crossed the dam, in order to get an unobstructed view of the lake. We tried the door to the shower room, which was open, so Oscie and I took a hot shower, and re-entered the land of the civilized.    I called my brother, who dutifully came and picked us up. While we waited, I looked at the forest on the other side of the dike, knowing that it was the entrance to the Smoky Mountain National Park and the beginning of next year's hike. Dogs are not allowed in the SMNP. I didn't have the heart to tell Oscie that that meant her.","Cable Gap Shelter

Once again I am itching to get back on the Trail, so have recently peeked in on the journals of those intrepid souls who are already out there. The entries chronicle the usual mixture of joy and pain that are the fare of AT hikers. I can't wait to be among you again.
The planning gets easier each year (this is #5), so there is not much to do now except dehydrate my meals, pack up, and go. I will pick up at Fontana Dam, where I left off last year, and hike north for about two weeks. One of these years I may find out what it is like to have ""trail legs,"" but not this year. 
Unfortunately, my hiking partner, Oscie, will not be with me this year due to the misguided and somewhat insulting rumor that she is a dog. It seems that some people are not welcome in the Smokies simply because of questionable bloodlines. She is taking the allegation pretty hard and has taken to her sickbed for the time being.
   I expect that some of you who are starting in early to mid April will have made it to Fontana Dam by the time I arrive on the scene and I look forward to seeing you out there. Happy Trails!","Fontana Dam

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521152,"The following is my hike from last May, as best I remember it:   On Friday, May 1, I drove non-stop from South Florida to Gatlinburg Tennessee, sans Oscie. I checked in at A Walk in the Woods shuttle service to make sure everything was good for an early start in the morning... it was. Then I headed downtown to find something to eat and check out Gatlinburg. Think upscale carnival; complete with loud music, plenty of neon, and sidewalks and crossings clogged with gawkers who were oblivious to the traffic jam they were causing. Think black socks and sandals. After eating, I retreated back to the motel and went over my gear one last time.    Now, hiking in the Smokies is a very regulated thing. Not only are dogs not allowed into the park, even if they are mostly human, but I am not sure that actual humans are all that welcome either. So, it seems that in order to discourage hikers from profaning the sanctity of the park with their very presence, a few regulations are in order. First, everyone shall have a hiking permit on his or her person at all times while in the park. And, as with most permits, there is a permit fee. There shall be absolutely no stealth camping. All hikers must stay at the designated camping areas, where shelters are provided. Further, all section hikers and day hikers must have a reservation to stay at each shelter and he or she must arrive at the shelter on the exact day of the reservation and leave the following day. Thru-hikers may stay in the shelters, but if a hiker with a reservation comes in, the thru-hiker must give up his or her space on the sleeping platform and leave the shelter immediately - but, everyone must sleep in the shelter if possible. To qualify as a thru-hiker, a hiker must have begun hiking at least fifty miles before entering the Smokies and must hike at least fifty miles away from the park before leaving the trail.   I did not want to have to make reservations for shelters, in fact, I didn't want to sleep in the shelters whether there was room or not. I did not want have to arrive at a particular shelter on a particular day either. One of the things I like about hiking is not having a schedule. So I applied for my thru-hiker permit, paid my thru-hiker fee, and became a thru-hiker. When my permit arrived, I applied the required fifty miles to it by crumpling it up, folding and unfolding it a few times, and rubbing some dirt on it. It made me feel wonderfully naughty.","Clewiston, FL

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521153,"I headed out early with Vesna Plakanis, the wife half of the husband and wife team who own A Walk in the Woods. She was very friendly and knew more facts about the Appalachian Mountains than Bill Bryson. One interesting fact she told me was that more Rangers and Ridge Runners were going to be hired for the 2016 hiking season. Apparently they are anticipating a stampede of hikers due to interest expected to be generated by the release of the movie version of Bryson's A Walk in the Woods. I have seen the movie and think they are being a bit too optimistic.    Anyway, we arrived at Fontana by mid morning and soon I was back on the Trail, going up, of course. I had not been hiking for more than an hour when I saw a Ridge Runner come scurrying down the Trail toward me. He looked like a man on a mission. He stopped in front of me, breathing hard, and obviously blocking the way.    ""Thru hiker?"" he asked.    ""Yep,"" I said, aware that I looked too fresh for the part.    ""Got your permit?""    ""Yep."" I patted my chest pouch.    ""Bear attack last night at Birch Spring Gap,"" he said. ""Dragged a boy out of his hammock... boy's father chased the bear away, but it got his pack.""    ""Wow,"" I said.    ""Alright, go ahead,"" he said, stepping out of the way, ""but don't stay at Birch Spring Gap.""    ""Don't worry,"" I said, ""I won't."" He hurried off to spread the word.    A few miles on, I came to Shuckstack Fire Tower. I stripped off my pack and climbed the ramshackle steps to the enclosed observation platform. Much of the floor was missing. Obviously OSHA had been nowhere near the place. Off in the distance, and far below, I could make out Fontana Dam off to the right of the lake. It was a pretty sight and worth the climb.    I hiked the rest of the day away and stopped for the night at Mollies Ridge Shelter. There were more hikers there than I had ever seen before at one shelter. I suppose that was due to the ban on stealth camping in the Smokies. While there, I heard the following conversation between two young hikers (insert expletives where indicated if desired).    ""Man, did you see that f***ing bear back there at Shuckstack Tower?""    ""Naw man, was you scared?""    ""F***ing A, man that f***er was huge.""    ""S*** man, I wish I'da saw him. I would have put my f***ing boot up his f***ing ass.""While I admired his his confidence, still, I thought his plan needed a little work.

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521260,"In the morning, as I was packing up my gear I heard some hikers complaining about their lack of sleep due to mice in the shelter. That made me thankful that I was a thru-hiker and not a lowly section-hiker, relegated to the confines of the shelter. I lit out before the crowd and tried to put in some miles early, while it was still cool. While leaving, I saw a deer that was so dark it was almost black. He was grazing peacefully and obviously used to seeing hikers.    It took me most of the morning to hike to the base of Rocky Top and then I struggled up on tired legs. After some time I reached the top and, yes, it was rocky. The summit was a boulder strewn area not much bigger than my living room and deposited square in the middle of it was a large black pile of bear scat. I would hate to have arrived in that small area with a bear already on the scene. Options, while limited, would not have included the aforementioned Boot Suppository Paradigm. The bear, though, was gone and the view was clear and beautiful. I wound my way around to Thunderhead Mountain for more spectacular views. Just as I was leaving and heading back down the other side, a young woman came along the trail from the direction of Rocky Top. She stuck out her hand and introduced herself as Alease, smiling warmly. I liked her right away. I saw her off and on for the remainder of my hike and always found her to be pleasant company...bright, well travelled, and a very strong hiker.    Late in the day, I hiked into Derrick Knob Shelter and set up my hammock on the side of a hill. Somehow, I found the energy to boil some water and prepare some of Jenny's Beef Stroganoff. Then, with a full stomach, it was off to sleep.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521680,"I left camp around 7:00 anxious to get up and over Clingman's,s Dome, the highest point on the AT. On the map, the climb didn't look to be too daunting, fairly gradual. It turned out to be a slow go though, because the Trail was so rough along that section. I happened upon a pair of huge turkeys who seemed enamored with one another. I let out with an amateurish but enthusiastic gobble and to my surprise one of the turkeys responded with a very professional gobble, along with a great flapping of wings. I think he was in the mood. It was a bright spot in an otherwise uneventful morning of just trudging along.    After what seemed a very long morning, I finally made it to the top of Clingman's Dome...the Trail part, that is. Several side trails led to the parking area and the famous overlook for tourists. I have seen many photos of that area and had no desire to visit it. There, there is a huge concrete sacrilege that looks like it was the brainchild of the same guy who designed the Interstate cloverleaf. From that vantage point tourists can observe and wax poetic about the majesty of nature without having to worry about getting any of it on themselves. As I was passing by, a hiker came down one of the side trails.   ""Aren't you going to the overlook? He asked.   ""Nope,"" I said.   ""It's not far,"" he said encouragingly.   ""Not interested,"" I said trying not to sound too rude.   ""It's just there,"" he said, pointing with his hiking stick.Just then Alease burst out into the open. She was coming from the direction of the overlook.    ""How was it? I asked.    ""Underwhelming,"" she said, sounding a little exasperated.    I guess she wasn't a big fan of concrete either. Without that, we headed off down the Trail. We hiked together for awhile and then she gradually pulled away as she got into her stride. It was more trudging for me.    Mt. Collins Shelter was a half mile off the Trail and was reached by hiking down what looked like a dry stream bed or, more likely, just a wash during the rainy season. I was thoroughly exhausted when I arrived. It had been a twelve hour hike. I set up my hammock in a dank, mossy area where the ground was covered with rotting tree trunks, and, after a quick meal, was immediately asleep.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522848,"I awoke fairly early and started the packing-up process. As I was tending to my gear, the tranquility of the morning was suddenly shattered. It was the Bear Whisperers. Somehow they had brought a quite impressive (in terms of power) sound system with them and were blasting rap music across the encampment as a complimentary wake-up call. I was not familiar with the song, but I assume it was entitled F***, as that was its principle lyric. And every time the principal lyric would roll around (which was often) one of the Whisperers would enthusiastically yell it out, for added emphasis, and, I suppose, for the appreciation of fine music lovers throughout the Appalachians. With the ""wa"" of the place thoroughly violated, I felt a sudden urge to hit the Trail.    I hiked the morning away while enjoying the views offered up by the Smokies. Most of the Trail from Springer to the Smokies consists of hiking up and down forested mountains with an occasional and welcome overlook. The Smokies are different. There are long stretches of trail with open and expansive views of rolling mountains. You really get a sense of the remoteness of the place. It was nice.    As I was nearing Icewater Spring Shelter I heard someone coming up behind me - it was Alease. We talked as we walked along and somehow the conversation turned to the devastating earthquake that had hit Nepal in April. She said that she had been hiking in Kathmandu during the previous year and that she had seen many of the shrines, etc. that now lay in ruins. She mostly talked, while I mostly listened. She was pretty passionate about hiking and had had lots of interesting adventures. You get to know people very quickly out on the Trail.    We hiked in to Icewater Spring Shelter, where we stopped for a bite of lunch and a rest. Alease leaned back against her pack and enjoyed some sun on her face while I filled up my water bottles. We had not been there long when the Bear Whisperers hiked in. Imagine my disappointment when, after no little debate, they decided that they would hike back to Newfound Gap and try to catch a ride down to Gatlinburg to take part in the Cinco de Mayo celebrations. Well, it was quite a blow, but I wished them well and got back on the Trail in short order.    The next stop was Charlie's Bunion, a large rock outcrop that was reached by detouring down a loop of side trail. The view was typically gorgeous and worth the time. It also afforded an opportunity for a well earned rest break.    Late that afternoon, I set up camp at Peck's Corner Shelter.

I have no recollection of anything at all for this day.     I do, however, remember an incident that happened that night. I had been asleep for a couple of hours when I was awoken by shouting from across the way. ""GO ON, BEAR ... GET OUT OF HERE, BEAR!"" This was accompanied by a great clatter of pots banging together and by more shouting from other spots around the camp, which was itself followed by a few minutes of nervous laughter and then dead quiet.    I tried to go back to sleep but all I could think about was my pack, with food inside, leaning against the tree at the head of my hammock. I had neglected to hang it from the bear cables and it was extremely vulnerable to bear hi-jinks. Any sane person would probably have been concerned about being mauled, but I kept having this vision of a bear galumphing off through the woods with my pack in his mouth and me showing up at Standing Bear Hostel the following day with no money for a shower. Finally, I got up and took the front pouch (in which I kept my money and other important sundries) off my pack and put it in the hammock with me, where we could be violated together, if it came to it.

Kingman & Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523441,"In the morning, there was lots of chatter around camp about the previous night's excitement. After all was said and done, I was not sure that the bear was not a figment of someone's vivid imagination, enhanced by some good herb, which was wafting around the night before.    I decided to take another detour, this time up to Mt. Cammerer, where there is an unusual lookout station that is a relic of a time long gone. It is an octagonal structure built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the late '30s. It sits atop a high rocky crag and commands a beautiful, panoramic view of the surrounding mountains. Of all the side trails I have taken, this one was probably one of the most worthwhile.     About mid afternoon, I passed out the Great Smoky Mountain National Park at Davenport Gap. After some searching around on a poorly marked section of Trail, I hiked into Standing Bear Hostel. All of the buildings were quaintly rustic and the place had a welcoming feel about it. Pansies grew prettily from a border of worn out hiking shoes. I finally found the proprietor, a gangly fellow with the unlikely name of Lumpy, who showed me around. There was the washroom - which consisted of a washboard in an aluminum washtub, where, I suppose, you could get your clothes as clean as you cared to scrub them - and next to it, one of them newfangled electric dryers. There was the commissary/pharmacy, which was run on the honor system - just report to Lumpy what you got. There was the mailroom, where packages where unceremoniously piled against one wall in something of a landslide. In one corner of the mailroom was the beer locker which was, in fact, locked and not on the honor system. There was the kitchen/dining area, consisting of a counter-top oven and one table with chairs. An assortment of sombreros nailed to the ceiling lent a festive, if incongruous, air to the place. And finally, after the bunkhouse, what I had been looking for - the shower.    I took a long and glorious shower, washing everything twice, and then headed for the mailroom. I went through every package there without finding the package I had mailed to myself. I re-stacked them, trying to put them in some sort of order as I searched through them a second time. The packages near the bottom were covered with ants and were a lost cause. No package for me. I went and found Lumpy who informed me that the mail had not run yet that day. I went and got an honor-system pizza, which I cooked and ate ravenously in the cantina. Then, I found Lumpy again, paid him for the pizza, and enquired as to the mail-run. He said the mail had not run yet. So, since it was getting dark and the prospects of a mail-run were looking bleak, I went and got some honor-system provisions for the remaining hike. Then, I went to pay Lumpy again, and, just for the fun of it, ask about the mail. Lumpy did not seem amused - I think he was beginning to find me tedious. With that, I called it a day.","Cosby Knob Shelter
