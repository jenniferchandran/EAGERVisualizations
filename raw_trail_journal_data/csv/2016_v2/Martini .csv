Martini ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482961,"Flashback to 1974- fraternity brother Gary Martini ,an avid outdoors man tells me about thru hiking the AT- I thought some day I will hike it.   I planned two thru hikes in the 80's and later 90's. Both before the Internet , so info was limited to Wingfoot's book and a few vhs tapes. I was able to talk with Wingfoot by phone - he was great. Job offers/ lack of funds over came the desire to hike. Now I have the time and resources. I thought about going this year-2015- but having never backpacked, and need to get into better hiking shape, will go in April of 2016! I will do some shake down hikes this spring and summer. My trail name will be Martini - in honor of my fraternity brother who never got to thru hike - I was told that Gary had died in the 70's when he stopped to help a woman fix a flat in the rain.","GA

Martini ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482963,Pre hike research includes reading many great books- through hike by apostle was very good! And AWOL 's book as well. Also read some stinkers as well. Recently talked on phone to 2015 thru hiker Can do- was impressed that he is 73 and has hiked many portions of the AT. Bought some permethium to treat clothing. Will send most to insect shield later this year. They claim 70 washes vs 10 for spray bottle.,"
