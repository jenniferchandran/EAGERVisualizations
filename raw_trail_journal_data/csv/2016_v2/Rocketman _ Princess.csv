Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524110,"When we finished our hike last year, I said I wouldn't do it again. Then again, I said the same thing when we finished in 2014. However, each year adds more aches & pains. Princess tells me that it would be much worse if I ever quit hiking and I suspect that she is right. But here's a short list of the real reasons: (1) the incredible beauty and variety of the trail, (2) the hiking friends that we've met and shared memories with, (3) the friends that we've met in the AT support community (trail maintainers, hostel & B&B owners, shuttlers, etc.), and (4) the personal challenge and satisfaction of walking from Georgia to Maine. We have changed our strategy and approach each year. The first year we were heavy into preps and planning, and we started off backpacking and camping. But several forces conspired to draw us into ""slack-packing"", and after Harpers Ferry (NoBo) we slept in the woods less than a dozen times. Last year our goal was to attempt to do the entire trail without camping at all (arranging shuttles to and from B&B's, motels, hostels, etc.) and ultimately we camped out only 4 nights on the way to Katahdin. This year, we're trying a different twist on the slack-packing theme, we're taking our car. There are several ways to integrate a car with shuttles and the car makes resupply, meals, etc. much easier. I'll describe the schemes in my daily journal as we try them out. We're starting later this year in hopes of avoiding some of the really cold weather, and we may jump over some sections and come back to finish them later in order to do New England earlier in the year.Why are we so enamored with slack-packing? The WEIGHT of course!! The first year our Springer pack weights were good - we thought. Fully loaded we each hefted 25 to 35 lbs (there were 3 of us then). We planned 20+ mail drops ranging from about 6 to 9 days apart. Now our slack-packs are much lighter, in the range of 5 to 7 pounds (much of it is water). AT our age, if we had to carry the full load all the way, our backs, our knees, our feet would probably break down before we finished. But implicit in our slack-packing concept is that we transform a thru-hike into a series of day hikes. This means that we don't stay in the woods, instead we arrange rides to and from the trail and sleep, eat, wash and enjoy the comforts of off-trail accommodations. Some people don't want to do the trail this way and some can't afford it. I'm not judging the motives of anyone else, but this approach works well for us and we thoroughly enjoy the trail. As it turns out, others have tried it when they heard about it and some have even joined us as we hike. We've upgraded some of our gear this year and I really like what we have. I wish I had done more conditioning, but it's too late now. We also have a draft of a book on how we've been hiking and we hope to finish it soon. We think this could make the trail accessible to folks who have wanted to hike the trail, but felt it was beyond their reach.In the meantime. we're striking out on Monday, March 19.",,"Blue Ridge, GA","Mar 19, Sat",0
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524230,"Today is a rest day. We gave ourselves a one-day break after driving all day yesterday from Norfolk, VA to Blue Ridge, GA. We’re staying with Princess’ brother, Ranger (and his wife Gay) who hiked parts of the trail with us in 2014 and 2015. They have a home that’s conveniently located not far from the AT southern terminus at Springer. It’s in the woods and we’re usually treated to some wildlife. This year a local bear has been stealing the food they leave out for deer. They say it’s pretty big and they have a picture to prove it. We may get a chance to check it out, since we’ll likely stay here for a couple of days. Yesterday was a beautiful drive, possibly the nicest that we’ve ever had. The long stretch of unseasonably warm weather held out one more day and it was cloudless most of the way. The roadside was awash in color - redbuds, cherry, pear and apple trees, forsythia, daffodils, and emerging green everywhere. We were tempted to wish that we started earlier, but spring should come a little later higher up in the hills. Mountain weather savants are talking about some freezing this week, that will be OK as long as it doesn’t include snow. Cooler weather will be fine with us, it reduces the snake and tick encounters.We think we have everything ready for tomorrow. It’s going to freeze tonight, and of course there’s a warning out for freezing rain and black ice through tomorrow morning. We seem to attract bad weather. We’ll make a decision in the morning. We need a good night’s sleep tonight.",,"Blue Ridge, GA","Mar 20, Sun",0
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524377,"Today was officially the first day of our 2016 hike, even though we didn’t cover much distance on the AT. This year we decided to hike the AT approach trail to the southern terminus. The approach trail starts at Amicalola Lodge in Georgia and covers about 8 miles from there to the top of Springer Mountain, gaining around 2,000 feet elevation in the process. Springer Mountain is actually the southern end of the Appalachian Trail, so the approach trail is not a part of the AT. There is a parking lot on the AT about a mile north of Springer and for the previous 2 years, we parked at that lot and hiked to the top of Springer, then started from there. This is the first time that we’ve hiked the approach trail and we’re doing it for the experience and as a prep hike.We’re staying with Princess’ brother (Ranger) and we talked him into helping us with transportation today. We all got up before 5 am and set out shortly after 6. Ranger drove his car, and Princess and I followed him in our car. Ranger’s home is near Springer, but the gravel approach trail is 6 1/2 miles long and in bad shape, so it was a long drive up to the Springer parking lot. Once there, we parked our car, grabbed our gear, climbed into Ranger’s car and we all headed back down the hill. When we got back down to the asphalt road, it was still a long drive around the mountain to Amicalola Lodge.The lodge was very pleasant. There was an ATC registration desk for AT Thru-hikers just inside and we took just enough time to sign in. When we signed the book, we were hiker numbers 851 and 852, so it’s going to be a busy year. And bear in mind that many hikers don’t do the approach trail and start at Springer Mtn instead. The first part of the approach trail was picturesque. About a half mile behind the lodge the trail started a long climb up a staircase that ran alongside Amicalola Falls. The falls were really beautiful and we had a closeup view as we climbed the 604 steps on the stairs. The remainder of the hike was more typical of AT woods hikes. Very pleasant, but not as distinctive. Several signs identified it as strenuous, but most of the climbs were relatively gradual. Overall, a good warmup hike.We encountered a few hikers along the approach trail, but there were far more when we reached the summit of Springer Mtn. It appeared that most people had driven up to the Springer parking lot and hiked the mile or so up to the top from there. We met several thru-hikers, but none had trail names yet. We all took photos of each other at the plaque that identifies the souther terminus of the AT, we signed into the registration book under the marker rock and then we headed on downhill.So now, we were officially on the AT for the last mile to the parking lot. All-in-all it was a pleasant hike, it started out cold and then warmed up to the mid-30’s with a strong wind throughout. Our new Z-packs windbreakers worked really well and I’m happy with mine. Our car was still at the parking lot (good news) and the lot was nearly full. So we hopped in and headed back down the 6 1/2 mile rough road one more time. We hiked 9.8 miles, but only 1 mile was on the AT. Clearly, my trail-legs didn’t survive the winter.","Amicalola Lodge

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524515,"Today was a great hiking day, mostly clear sky, a cold start but it climbed to 67 by the end of the afternoon. When we got our standard o’dark start, it was 28 deg in Blue Ridge. As we climbed up toward the Springer parking area, the temp rose to 35 when I dropped Princess off at the lot. A warm front was moving through and the trend continued throughout the day. Princess started hiking NoBo from the Springer lot while I continued driving the gravel mountain roads (~ 8 mi) to Horse Gap. I parked the car there, grabbed my gear, locked the car and headed SoBo back toward the Springer lot. The temp was actually 32 deg there, but I started with a steep climb and warmed up quickly. So she hiked north while I hiked south and we met somewhere near the middle (she was hiking while I was driving, so she got farther than I did). We call it a “key swap”, but we both have keys so we don’t have to worry about forgetting to swap. She hiked the rest of the way to Horse Gap, hopped in the car and drove back to her starting point (the Springer lot) to pick me up at the end of my hike. It worked fine, she’s a faster hiker (and competitive) so she beat me back to the starting point. The trail was jammed with oodles of hikers. A lot of thru-hikers start the first couple of weeks in March. They’re not wearing signs or name tags, but typically they have the biggest backpacks - often up to 35 lbs, and they’re sucking wind getting up the steeper slopes. Some are in good physical shape and they have smiles, those who haven’t been working out have worried looks (what have I got myself into?). But in my opinion, today the thru-hikers were considerably outnumbered by day hikers and section hikers. It’s spring break time and a number of younger hikers are out for maybe a couple of days. I met a few section hikers who said they were going to hike the Georgia section, or between 2 specific trail points and I saw one student group of about a dozen and another group of ladies just out for a stroll up to the waterfall at Three Forks. All in all, I don’t think I’ve seen a busier day on the AT. But I was hiking SoBo and most of the crowd was headed NoBo.Out gear is working out pretty well for us. The mornings have been close to freezing with some wind. I mentioned our new Z-pack windbreakers yesterday, and they are working out great. Our friend, Focus, who hiked with us last year had one and it seemed to work very well as we got further north and the mountaintops got cooler and cooler. They are incredibly light (about 2 oz), almost flimsy, but Focus wore his a lot and it seemed to be quite durable. Its water repellant, but not waterproof and it has a hood and full-length zipper. I’ve been wearing it for the cold mornings (low 30’s) with just a short-sleeve jogging shirt and cycling arm-warmers. And I have 3 combinations of glove liners and shells - as long as my hands are warm, I’m warm. I’m cold when I first get out there, but after 5 minutes of climb I’m fine. The windbreaker stows into a built-in pocket about the size of a wallet. We still carry our Thermoball jackets for emergencies or if we get stopped for some reason, and I carry a toboggan and a buff.Tomorrow is another relatively short day. We plan to keep the distance close to 10 miles for a little longer before we start extending it. Tomorrow is expected to be a little warmer than today.","Springer Mountain Parking Lot
",Horse Gap,"Mar 22, Tue",8.50
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524625,"Woody Gap was full of Trail Magic today. Two different groups had tables set out in the parking lot and they had plenty of hikers when we finished there around noon. They had a full spectrum of goodies and I couldn’t pass up a hot dog. It was a great way to end a great hike. While we were there several hikers we had passed earlier on the trail drifted in and took a break with refreshments. We chatted for a while and thanked the hosts for their generosity before leaving.We had shuttle assistance from Ranger again today. He drove his Explorer to our finishing point (Woody Gap) and we followed him there. Then we left our car at Woody Gap and drove with him to our starting point at Horse Gap. The road from Woody to Horse was gravel and Ranger felt that his Explorer was better equipped for the road than our car. So Princess and I were able to hike together from Horse Gap back to our car at Woody Gap. It was cold (30’s) again at the outset, but it warmed quickly to the mid-60’s when we finished. Our first challenge was Sassafras Mountain, we remember this climb from our first year - a pretty aggressive climb for about a mile. Justus Mountain was next, a shorter climb and the remainder of the hike was a series of short ups and downs. Just as yesterday, the trail was very busy. We saw a few souls out early, but a lot of hikers were still snoozing in their tents. Later as the sun warmed the air the trail traffic thickened and we passed a number of hikers that we’ve seen over the past 2 days. A few names stick, like KiltWookie, Chef Ducky, Patriot, Popeye, Rosie, Momma Goose, and Farmer. We’re also finding that a number of hikers don’t have trail names yet. Years ago, trail names were apparently bestowed by fellow hikers, based on a humorous event or an unusual quirk, etc. Today, many decide to self-assign their trail name, to avoid the potential of a less-flattering alternative. As we came around one bend we saw a tent set up by the trail with 20 or so folks milling around. I think it was a club of some sort (hiking) and we passed on by. In general, everyone is in a very good mood. The temperatures have been very mild this week and no one has had to deal with a lot of rain or snow. But there is rain in the forecast tomorrow afternoon and Friday AM as a front passes through with some possibly severe storms. Our hike tomorrow is about the same length as today and we hope to get an early start and be off the trail before the bad weather arrives.","Horse Gap
",Woody Gap,"Mar 23, Wed",10.30
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524767,"The weather was on everyone’s mind today, a storm system was racing toward us from the west - the classic confrontation between warm wet air and a cool front. Rain and potentially severe weather was predicted to arrive in late afternoon, extending into the evening. We had a short hike on tap, just under 11 miles, so we figured we could be finished well before the weather deteriorated as long as we kept moving. But one of us was going to have to hike over Blood Mountain at the end of the hike, the highest peak along the AT in Georgia at 4,450 ft. The problem with that is that the peak has exposed, rocky sections that are not a good place to be with the potential of thunderstorms. We planned a “key swap” today, I drove Princess to the northern end of the day hike where she started SoBo (at about 7:15 am) and then drove the car to Woody’s Gap, parked it, and started hiking north a few minutes before 8. Yesterday this gap was filled with Trail Magic and hikers, today it was deserted, except for one hiker who was trying to figure out the distance to the nearest town. Initially the weather was delightful, mid-50’s and warm enough for a running shirt, light arm-warmers and biking gloves. For me, the trail was pretty easy - there were some stiff climbs, but they didn’t last long and most of the trail was well-maintained and easy to walk. I didn’t see many other hikers at the outset, but quite a few tents just off the trail. An hour to two later the traffic picked up. Since I only have a lightweight slack pack, I can typically move faster than most other thru-hikers since they’re carrying full backpacks with several days of food. So as others broke camp and joined the trail, I would pass them - especially as they are chugging uphill. Not that I’m that fast, but in several weeks the backpackers will have “trail-legs” and they’ll be passing me. Anyway, I saw a lot of people again today. I only mention this because it’s quite different than my experience the last 2 years when I would only see perhaps a half-dozen hikers on a stretch of NoBo. I had several good conversations, one with Matt V., who has worked with a space-based Search & Rescue satellite system and we had a number of things in common. I hope to see him again, he looks like a strong hiker and likely to make it through. I passed a lot of folks, but mostly didn’t slow down to chat because I was worried about finishing before the storm.I passed Princess just shy of the midpoint for the day. Obviously we don’t actually swap a key, but “key-swap” makes it easy to understand what we’re doing. She said that she had passed a lot of hikers since she was hiking SoBo and the wave of hikers is moving NoBo. She said that everyone was concerned about the weather and many were hoping to stay at the Neel Gap hostel. We were both in good spirits, the sky was still clear and we moved on our respective ways. Most of the rest of my hike was pretty easy, until the last 3 or 4 miles, as I started up Blood Mountain. It started as a series of small ups, but eventually became a steeper climb over a series of rock steps. I passed 3 or 4 thru-hikers who had stopped to catch their breath. Also, by now it was apparent that the weather was changing, some clouds had rolled in and the wind was picking up, but nothing threatening. I think Blood is interesting because it’s the first mountain on the NoBo hike that has a distinctly different terrain around the peak. After climbing through open woods, it changes to laurel and rhododendron groves that close in on the trail. And the footing changes to inclined sheets of rock. There is a stone shelter at the top (with a privy), but the fireplace doesn’t work, the window openings don’t have windows and it’s surrounded by large rocks that mostly block the view. There were perhaps 15 or 20 hikers milling or sitting around the shelter, but I don’t think there is that much space in the shelter and rain would blow in through the window openings. It’s an old shelter, perhaps the oldest along this section of the AT. I moved on quickly, the wind was stronger at the top and chilly since I was damp from the climb. The downhill (NoBo) side was much steeper that I remembered, it went down in 2014, but I did it SoBo last year. There are some steeply slanted rock faces near the top with some good views of surrounding ranges, a lot of steep stone steps that are hard on knees, and a section through some jumbled rocks that takes patience. I followed another thru-hiker from FL down most of it and he moved pretty quickly through it. I wasn’t fast enough to try to pass. Later when I talked with Princess, she said it was a much tougher ascent (SoBo) than she remembered from last year and took her longer than she expected. The last mile or so is a gentle descent down a wide, easy path to US 19 and Neel Gap. There is an outfitter in an historic stone building complex at this gap, and Princess was waiting in our car when I crossed the road (although she confessed that she had not been there long). We spent some time in the store, picked up a few things and learned how small the AT world is. Last year, we met 2 other hikers in Connecticut and ended up hiking the rest of the way to Mt. Katahdin with them (Spartacus and Focus). Spartacus is a good story-teller and along the way he often spoke of Silent Bob, a younger hiker he walked with earlier in his thru-hike. As we were talking to Pretzel (one of the staff), another staffer came by and thought that he recognized Princess’ name. It turned out that he was Silent Bob. We reminisced a bit about Spartacus and we gat a text from him just recently that he is in Australia for a few months. We took a photo that we’ll text to Spartacus. We’ll be passing through Neel Gap again tomorrow, so we’ll likely see him again.Pretzel, the other staffer shared some info regarding the John Muir Trail (we’ve just received word that we made it through the lottery to get JMT passes later this year). Pretzel was interested in our slack packs and he also took a photo of us to include on their Facebook page since we’ve been working several ways to hike the AT.I didn’t intend to write this much, but it was an interesting day for us. We’re hoping the rain will quit by starting time tomorrow and we’ll just have to deal with some mud. The temps will only be a little cooler than today.","Woody Gap
",Neel Gap,"Mar 24, Thu",10.90
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524827,"I think I may have discussed this last year: Is there a specific definition for a Zero Day? Today we hiked 6.9 miles. In absolute terms, a Zero Day would seem to be 0 miles. But it seems that many hikers feel that any day that is significantly less than their average distance deserves to be called a Zero. Princess and I have been starting slowly this year, poking along at around 10 miles/day. Last year we generally assumed that 16 or 17 miles/day was our sweet spot. But we have to work up to that and Norfolk isn’t very conducive to mountain hiking conditioning (the highest hills in Norfolk are the overpasses). So we’re slowly acclimating to the AT terrain. One drawback of slack-packing with a passenger car (no 4WD or rugged suspension) is that our daily distances are determined mostly by the quality of the roads to the access points along the trail, and today just worked out to be short. A more rugged car would give us more flexibility. Anyway, a Zero Day implies a rest, so we finished early and we’re relaxing - call it what you may.This was a “key-swap” day. I dropped Princess at Neel Gap where she started hiking NoBo, and I drove to Hog Pen Gap, left the car and started hiking SoBo. Since it was a short day, we slept in later than usual and started maybe an hour later than yesterday. Fortunately, yesterday’s storm system didn’t seem as bad as predicted, mostly just a rain event. The sun was shining at Neel Gap, but I hiked in a cloud for the first hour at the north end of the day’s hike. The trail was damp, but not muddy at all - good news. We covered 3 mountains: Levelland (unusual name for a mountain), Cowrock and Wildcat. They ranged from 3,637 to 3,870 feet and mostly it was a ridge walk. Several hikers I passed were OK with photos and I’ve included a couple: Momma Goose, Matt & Josh. I saw maybe 2 dozen on the trail and still more at Neel Gap getting ready to push on north. We were finished hiking and in our car headed back by noon. We’re still staying with Princess’ brother in Blue Ridge, no doubt overstaying our welcome (per the old saying “fish and relatives . . . after 3 days”), but they are very gracious and Ranger may help us again with transportation. The commute to the AT gets longer every day and we expect to leave on Sunday. The logistics associated with having a car seem daunting, but Princess commented yesterday that we’re learning a lot more about the areas around the AT. When we relied on shuttle drivers, we used their knowledge of the trail access points. So it’s a different experience.","Neel Gap
",Hog Pen Gap,"Mar 25, Fri",6.90
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525000,"Today was payback for our relaxing (short) hike yesterday. Our distance today was 16.7 miles, with some challenging climbs. So we’re tired and a bit sore. It was certainly good training for the longer distances we’ll need to do soon. And all-in-all it was a really good hike. We met a lot of people, the trail was in great shape, the weather was good for hiking, and we didn’t run into any issues. Princess’ brother stepped in and helped us one more time today. We followed him to Dick’s Creek Gap (about an hours drive from Blue Ridge) where we left our car, and then he drove us to Unicoi Gap where we started hiking NoBo and he headed back to Blue Ridge. This enabled us to hike together (rather than the key-swap where we hike in opposite directions). He also suggested that we switch our plans and skip ahead one section. Today was dry, but rain is predicted for tomorrow and the section we did today would have been harder in the rain. Tomorrow we’ll do the section we skipped today and the weather shouldn’t be as big an issue. There were 3 significant mountains to climb today, the first was Rocky Mtn - a good warmup climb of about 1,000 ft in 1 1/2 mi. The second was Tray Mtn. This was the main event of this section since Tray (at 4,430 ft) is only about 30 feet above Blood Mtn (the highest point on the AT in Georgia). We remembered Tray from the last 2 years as a very long pull, the climb to the top is 2 1/2 miles. The trail on the upper slopes passes through groves of laurel and rhododendron, a feature we’ve observed on a number of the southern mountains. The peak on Tray is relatively short, a few rock slabs with a vista and then the trail turns down. The third peak was Kelly Knob and we didn’t remember it as significant. But it turned out to be tough for us and others. The slope was aggressive (steep) and continuous for about a mile and we passed at least 5 other hikers who were stopped on the climb trying to catch their breath. (We’re not passing them because we’re stronger, but because we’re slack-packing and carrying a much smaller pack.) Anyway, we agreed after the hike that the third climb (Kelly) was the toughest, partly because of how steep and continuous it is and probably also because we had already hiked several significant mountains. Some of the climbs in New England are much tougher, but we should be in better shape by then. Today was the first time that I heard Princess humming “When the Saints Come Marching In”, Pintsize may remember that.We passed quite a few hikers on the trail today. The first was a gentleman who started at almost the same time we did at Unicoi Gap. He headed up the Rocky Mtn steps just ahead of us, but took his time finishing his coffee and munching on a goodie, and we passed him relatively quickly. We cranked up and over the first hill and had forgotten about him until early in the descent he literally ran past us, he was jogging the trail. We didn’t see him again until we were less than a mile from the finish and we talked with him for the rest of the way. Both he (Odometer) and his wife (Gutsy) are hikers, he’s done the AT in sections (finishing last year) and his wife did a thru-hike years ago. We had a good conversation and traded experiences and then met his wife who was waiting in the parking area when we arrived at Dick’s Creek Gap. He was moving much faster than us on the trail, but diverted to one of the shelters and spent some time there before catching up with us at the end. He and his wife plan to head out to do part of the Continental Divide Trail soon. We also encountered a volunteer trail maintainer, Stone Kicker, on the descent from Tray Mtn. We had noticed that there was fresh trail work during our ascent, the erosion control runoff channels had just been cleared. Later when we saw Stone Kicker coming up the trail carrying a strange-looking hoe, we learned that he was taking care of both sides of the mountain. He was very friendly and quite proud of his work. He demonstrated how he got his trail name (Stone Kicker), he showed us how he kicked any loose rocks out of the trail that might trip a hiker. We always enjoy meeting trail maintainers and expressing our appreciation for their efforts. I’ve included a picture of Stone Kicker.We also encountered John, an acquaintance from Norfolk, when we arrived at Dick’s Creek Gap. We have known his parents (Janet & Eric) for a year or so and found out through them that he is an AT hiker. He started a thru-hike several years ago, but had to stop when he was injured. We shared trail experiences with John several times and knew that he was starting another thru-hike attempt from Springer last weekend. He is a day ahead of us at this point, but he plans to zero in Hiawassee tomorrow, so we expect that we may see him again.It was a full day and there are more stories, but it’s also bed time and we have a long, wet hike on tap tomorrow. Tonight is our last night with Princess’ brother, Ranger and his wife Gay. They have been super hosts, putting up with us for a week without complaining. And Ranger has helped us with transportation throughout the past week, and we owe him big time for that. Ranger has done large pieces of the AT with us in the past 2 years, including everything up to Harpers Ferry and climbing Mt. Katahdin twice. We are planning more hiking adventures in the future - I’ll talk more about that later on a slower news day.","Unicoi Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525112,"When our alarm clock went off at 4:45 am, we checked out the window and were relieved to see that the outside deck was dry. The overnight rain didn’t materialize. Ranger pulled together a great breakfast for us, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, coffee and a protein shake. We stayed with Gay and Ranger for a week and now it’s time to move on and give them some breathing room. They have been incredibly hospitable and we’ll miss them, their dogs, cat, chickens and deer, but not the rooster (who decided I was an adversary and threatened to attack me). They have regular visits from a family of deer, but they think the bear has moved on.We had our gear packed and left on schedule before sunrise, and just about that time the rain started. In the beginning it wasn’t heavy, just a drizzle. We had about an hour and a half drive from Blue Ridge through Blairsville and Hiawassee and then up to the AT crossing at Unicoi Gap. Today we picked up the section that we skipped yesterday, thinking that today’s section would not be as difficult in the expected rain. Today we did a key swap with Princess going SoBo from Unicoi Gap to Hog Pen Gap, while I did the same section NoBo. Ultimately, switching the two sections was probably the best for us, but we expected the rain to be intermittent. It wasn’t. We were in a cloud for virtually the entire hike and we ended up thoroughly soaked. Princess started out with a Z-packs hooded jacket, but eventually stowed it and hiked without any rain gear. I used my Z-packs poncho and it kept me dry for maybe half of the hike. At least I had good thermal management, the poncho is well ventilated. Princess said she got caught in a downpour not too far from the end of her hike. Princess had a really tough 1 1/2 mile uphill climb (1,000 ft) at the beginning of her hike, a lot of rocks, roots and it was turning to mud. The remainder of her hike was relatively level. I had the opposite. About a 13-mile walk, then the steep downhill over the rocks and roots. Only now, it was a lot of slippery mud - really slow going.Today, after Princess picked me up at the trailhead, we had a full agenda for the rest of the day. Our new base for 2 days will be in Hiawassee, GA. We checked in to the Holiday Express and then spent about 2 hours getting our gear inside and cleaned up, showering, and washing clothes. We ate dinner next door and then decided to drive out to tomorrow’s trailhead to be sure we could get there. It was a long drive, partly over a forest service road. We’re glad we did, it gives us a lot more confidence in tomorrow’s schedule. Plus we decided that we need a different map of NC, and we had to search around town to find what we needed. Then a trip to Ingles for some supplies and back to the room to prep for tomorrow. I’ve also developed a blister that takes time to treat. Princess has turned into a blister expert and has it under control. So all of a sudden, it’s 10:30 - well past hiker midnight. The weather gurus say the rain will end around 7 or 8 in the morning, and it will clear up by mid-morning for the rest of the day. Hope so.","Hog Pen Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525229,"I really felt exhiliarated today. Perhaps because yesterday was pretty miserable weather, and today was the exact opposite? It just felt really good to be out on the trail.We key swapped again today and the trailheads at each end of our day’s hike were pretty far apart, so an early start was critical. I didn’t feel like I had enough sleep since I got to bed so late, I need to improve on that. We were ready early and I drove Princess to the northern end of our hike. I got her there just at daybreak and she set out from Deep Gap with just enough light to see. The Deep Gap parking lot is at the end of a narrow, twisty 8 mile gravel mountain road and it was well over an hour before I managed to get to the other end of the hike at Dick’s Creek Gap. The trailhead was pretty quiet, one hiker was there and a few minutes later a van dropped off several others. The weather forecast said it would start out chilly and then warm mid-morning, so I dressed for the warmer temps. When I finished lacing my boots and strapping on my gaitors, I followed the other hikers up the trail. It was an uphill start and I caught up quickly as they were all stuffing their heavier coats into their backpacks. I didn’t see them again, and in fact I didn’t see nearly as many other hikers today as on previous days. Over the course of the hike, I passed perhaps 6 NoBo’s and about the same number of SoBo’s. And I usually see a number of tents still set up early in the morning, but not so many today. Hiawassee is relatively close to the trailhead and maybe some hikers decided to take a zero in Hiawassee and were sleeping in this morning?As the morning progressed, the temp did rise, but I never got overheated. The skies were clear, a beautiful deep blue and the sun cast strong shadows since the mountain trees don’t yet have any leaves. I was by myself for hours and thoroughly enjoyed listening to the sounds of the forest. I thought I heard a hiker approaching, then realized it was a grouse drumming. The windward sides of the mountains were cool and refreshing and the lee sides were toasty and warm. It was a great day to be outside.A few details on the hiking profile: I had an elevation gain of about 1,700 ft from start to finish and there were several mountains to cross, Buzzard Knob at 3,679, Courthouse Bald at 4,708, and we skirted near the tops of Yellow Mtn around 4,500 and Brushy Mtn perhaps 200 ft lower. So I did a lot of climbing. A couple of the climbs were strenuous with long steep slopes. When I passed Princess a couple of hours after I started she said the hardest climbs were still ahead of me. And she also warned that the northern sides of the mountains were still wet, muddy, rocky and slick, so beware. And she was right. A noteworthy event today - we crossed the state border between Georgia and North Carolina. So we officially have state #1 under our belts. The border is simply a small wooden sign nailed to a tree on a narrow hillside trail. I’ve been there 3 times now and each time there is someone there taking pics.","Dicks Creek Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525358,"We packed up and moved out of Hiawassee, NC early this morning. Our commute to the trail from Hiawassee had reached almost an hour on paved roads, and was much longer depending on whether we needed the Forest Service roads. Today we had about 8 miles of FS roads to get to the starting point and about the same distance to the ending point. The FS roads are impressive, they provide access into remote mountainous areas and we would’t be able to slack pack if they weren’t available. Typically, in this area (GA, NC, TN), they are gravel roads, usually a single lane with turnouts that wind around the mountainsides (fortunately, I haven’t met many other vehicles on these roads). I suspect that most were former logging roads and signs are often posted indicating that logging trucks may be encountered. I believe that road maintenance is typically done with a grader that levels and smooths the surface and removes larger rocks, perhaps once a year. The FS roads that I’ve been using are accessible to passenger cars, but they can challenging and a more rugged vehicle would be a better choice than a Prius (better suspension, higher clearance, better tires). Besides very narrow roads with dramatic drop-offs, these roads often have water damage that leads to deep ruts, exposed rocks and potholes. So I have to take them very slowly, but generally if the road has been maintained and without major damage from water (or logging trucks), I can go up to 25 mph. Usually, if we plan to use an FS road we’re not familiar with, we drive it the day before to be sure that it’s in reasonable condition. [We have had problems after storms with fallen trees that blocked the FS roads until someone with a chain saw comes along, some of our past shuttle drivers carried chain saws for this reason.] So today, I dropped Princess off at Deep Gap at daybreak and then drove to the Albert Mountain parking lot where I started. So she went NoBo and I went SoBo. I had the easier hike down from Albert and she had a long pull up Standing Indian Mountain. We had good memories of the Standing Indian Shelter. This is the first year that we haven’t stayed in that shelter. In 2014, our first AT, we met Pintsize at this shelter and last year, we stayed there with Ranger. Standing Indian Mtn is listed at 5,435 ft elevation and the NoBo climb to the top is 2 1/2 miles, while the SoBo climb is more gradual but much longer. Albert is the only other named climb and we won’t get all the way to the firetower at the top until tomorrow. Much of the trail today was through what I call “rhodo tunnels” (rhododendron). The trail goes through thick groves of rhododendrons that close overhead making it a tunnel. These cool, shady tunnels can be inviting in the summer, but today they were chilly. The plants also hold moisture, so the tunnel trails can be muddy after a rain. Princess observed that it would be fun to take the trail when the rhodos are blooming, it must be spectacular - but we’ve always been too early.Our new home base is in Topton, NC, not far from Nantahala Lake. Its a very nicely-equipped A-frame cabin with lots of amenities. Ranger found it and we stayed here last year with them while we hiked through the area. We plan to stay here 3 days. The nearest larger town is Franklin and it’s about an hour away, so we brought what we think we’ll need. But there are a couple of local restaurants that we may check out.Our good weather is still holding good. Today was a cold start, near freezing on the trail at the start. But it warmed up quickly into the 60s and was quite comfortable. Tomorrow should be a little less extreme, 40s at the start and nosing into the 60s mid-day. After that we’ll have to deal with rain on Thurs and Fri. But for now, it’s toasty in the cabin. Cheers from NC.","Deep Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525537,"Yet another beautiful hiking day. I didn’t meet a hiker today without a smile on their face (well, except maybe for a few who were trudging uphill). It was absolutely perfect. Cool start, no clouds, warming sun, peaceful in the woods - about all I could hear was the rustling of leaves, a few furry natives, some woodpeckers and several drumming grouse. The trees at lower elevations are starting to show shades of light green, the redbuds are fluorescent, and green shoots are sprouting all along the trail. Today’s trail had all sorts of variation in terrain, it included a couple of climbs - notably Albert Mountain at 5,250 ft including the fire tower atop the summit. We did another key swap today and my starting point was the FS road about a quarter mile short of the top on the south side. I was hiking NoBo, so I started with the final ascent to the top. This last part is also the steepest, so it was a good warmup and parts of it reminded me of some New England climbs. I did get the impression that the trail managers have done a little rerouting, but it’s still challenging. The fire tower is impressive, I’m not comfortable with climbing these things although I did go up a couple of flights just to get a better view. The top is crowned with groves of rhododendrons (and perhaps laurel), so it’s shielded. However, the viewing platform offers a clear panorama of the surrounding valleys and mountains toward the east. I’ve included a photo of the vista from the top and believe me, the photo doesn’t do it justice. These views from the top make me feel like I’m on the top of the world, the mountain ranges seem to stretch forever. Another important feature of the tower is that it marks the 100-mile point on the NoBo trail, an impressive milestone. I got there just after 8:00 am and there were still a couple of tents in place around the base of the tower. I talked with one young lady briefly, and after that, I didn’t see another soul for about an hour and a half. On the other hand, Princess coming from the other direction, saw a lot of hikers - mostly just after she started at Winding Stair Gap. Later in the morning when Princess reached the fire tower at the end of her SoBo hike, she saw Shaggy (we think that’s his trail name). We know his parents back in Norfolk and met him a couple of times with them. I’ve included a photo she took of him at the tower.After a couple of longer days, we had a short hike today - only about 10 miles. Later when we were back at the cabin, we sort of regretted not hiking longer since the day was so beautiful. The rain that’s been forecast for tomorrow seems to be shaping up to be worse than we hoped. It will likely start several hours after we start and may be heavy at times. The system looks fairly well developed and may generate rain lasting through Friday and perhaps into Saturday. It triggered some replanning on our part and we’re considering several options over the next 4 or 5 days. We don’t have much flexibility in accommodations since we’ve already made arrangements, but we may rearrange the order of our hikes and come back to pick up a section near here after the weekend.After our hike today, we drove into Franklin for lunch and to get some groceries. When we stayed in Franklin in 2014, Ron Haven took us to Fat Buddies Ribs & BBQ. And today marks the third year in a row that we’ve eaten there (Ranger is a fan too). We even took a carryout order of ribs home for dinner. I guess I’m an easy target for BBQ ribs. Princess has whomped up chili for tomorrow, that should go well after a chilly, rainy day. I hope the weather will be better in your neck of the woods.A quick thank you to those who have been leaving a note in our guest book. In the past, I’ve tried to reply to as many as I could. I’m afraid I failed at that last year. But I am trying to respond with emails to those with specific questions, and I really appreciate the suggestions you’ve passed our way. Our experience this year is considerably different from the past 2 years, so clearly we have a lot more to learn and we can learn a lot from others.","USFS 67 on Albert Mtn
",Winding Stair Gap,"Mar 30, Wed",9.80
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525635,"I mentioned yesterday that we might replan our hike today because of weather. A front is moving through the area and triggering several bands of rain showers. Rain alone wouldn’t be a problem, but early this morning the forecast called for periods of intense rain, high winds and possible thundershowers. At 5:30 AM it was quiet outside, so we decided to do a shorter 5 or 6 mile hike that we should be able to finish before the bad weather arrived. So we resolved to hike from Winding Stair Gap to Wayah Road (Rte 1310). Princess hiked it SoBo and I hiked NoBo from Winding Stair. The hike itself took each of us less than 2 hours. But with the key swap strategy, each of us had to drive from one end of the hike to the other. In this section, the AT follows a ridge, but the access roads run up and down the mountains. So the drive from one end to the other goes down one mountain road to a valley and then back up another mountain road to the other point on the trail. It took each of us over half an hour to drive from one end to the other. It wasn’t a major problem, but it illustrates one of the challenges associated with slack-packing. Driving distances can be much much longer than the associated hiking distances.Regardless, the hike was fine. The rain waited until we were finished, and in fact it was still dry when we arrived back at the cabin. But the weather weenies were right, an hour or so later it started raining and now it’s coming down pretty hard with gusting winds. Now, since we’ve had a couple of short days, we need to insert an extra hiking day into our plans. So Princess went to work and rebuilt our schedule. She arranged for us to stay one more day than planned here in the cabin and then she was able to move our reservations in Bryson City to a day later. So tomorrow (Friday), we’ll hike from Wayah Rd. to Tellico Gap, and then on Saturday from Tellico Gap to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). And since we’ve been key-swapping for several days, she arranged a shuttle for us so that we can hike together from Tellico into the NOC. All of this takes time on the phone, so one downside to slack packing is all the logistics and arrangements that are needed.Anyway, the hiking itself was great. The trail through this area is in good shape. It’s been dry for a while (until today), so the trail is firm and there’s no problem with footing. The maintainers are keeping the blazes fresh and the trail clear of debris and blowdowns. I haven’t visited any of the shelters, but I haven’t heard any complaints about them. My hike today consisted mostly of climbing up gradually to Siler Bald at about 5,000 ft and then descending more rapidly to Wayah Gap. Besides Princess, I only met 2 other SoBo hikers and didn’t pass anyone going NoBo. We think a number of hikers elected to take a zero because of the weather and are staying in Franklin. Right now, that seems a good choice because it’s raining hard. If it continues at this rate, it could cause a problem on the trail if the water level rises in the creeks and streams that we cross. A few have actual wooden bridges, but in many cases the only ways to cross are to rock-hop or wade (ford). But if the water levels rise significantly, neither method is attractive. So check in tomorrow and I’ll let you know how that goes.","Winding Stair Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525969,"The weather last night was wild. The rain started in the late afternoon and was intermittent until after dark. Then it really started pouring. Our cabin has a tin roof and it was loud, complete with thunder and lightning. Around 7 pm I got a notification on my iPhone that the Weather Service had issued a tornado watch for the county where we’re staying, but I don’t think the threat materialized. The rain & wind didn’t abate and I had a hard time getting to sleep. When we woke at 5 am, it was still raining hard so we slept in a little longer and a half hour later it quit. We expected that the trails would be very wet and the streams would be difficult to cross.Princess started hiking SoBo at Tellico Gap. We drove up in the dark and the last mile or two was a winding gravel road. The trailhead at the gap was shrouded in mist with just enough light seeping through to hike. Princess set out and I drove back down the access road and on to the other end of our day’s hike. When I parked the car at Wayah Rd and started NoBo back toward Princess, dawn revealed an overcast sky with light drizzle and fog. I pulled on my Z-pack poncho to keep my slack pack dry. The drizzle slowed over several hours and finally stopped. But the steady drip from the fog condensing on the overhead trees lasted much longer (tree rain). The good news was that the temp was very mild, great for hiking.For the most part, the trail handled the downpour well and was still firm enough for good footing. However, there were spots where the water just didn’t drain fast enough and I had to do some side-stepping and rock dancing. I did manage to avoid slipping or tripping, mud is hard to brush off your clothes. Probably the worst part was several sections where the water was flowing down the trail, the trail was the drainage ditch.I didn’t see very many hikers today. A few were waking up and breaking camp in the first couple of hours, I met Princess midway and then passed a few more in the last couple of miles. The Cold Spring Shelter is right on the trail and three hikers were still there as I went by. It was late morning and they had their gear spread out - probably trying to dry it. I took a picture of the stone tower on Wayah Bald. I shoot it every year, its an impressive stone structure. The initial tower was made of wood and used as a fire lookout. In the 1930’s the CCC rebuilt the tower from quarry stone and it had a public viewing platform as well as accommodations for 2 fire watchmen on the top floor. Apparently it was a popular spot, the kiosk indicates that 9,000 people signed the visitor book in 1937. The AT crosses a number of fire towers (Albert Mtn just a few days ago). Essentially all of them have been deactivated. In some cases, all that remains are the concrete footers for the structure. Perhaps satellite systems do the watching today, and forest management techniques like controlled burns have reduced the hazard? Today was not a good viewing day, all I could see was a cloud, so I took another pic of the tower and pushed on. The climb to Wayah was a long tough uphill grind and later I faced the same challenge in climbing up to Cooper Ridge Bald and Rocky Bald. All of these are in the vicinity of 5,000 ft. At least the sun had broken out for the latter climb and I had some good views from the ridge.For me, the end of the hike was a very steep descent. It would have been tough on a dry day, not to mention adding mud and wet rocks. I felt sorry for Princess all the way down, she had to hike up the same slope at the beginning of her hike.We’re packing up tonight, it’s time to say farewell to the cabin and move on to Bryson City.","Wayah Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526281,"Today Princess & I hiked together for a change. Instead of the key-swap, we hired a shuttle driver. We left our car at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) where the shuttle driver picked us up, and then he drove us to the Tellico Gap trailhead (where we left off yesterday afternoon). So the two of us hiked NoBo from Tellico to the NOC where we picked up our car and drove to our new home base in Bryson City. Leaving the cabin was a little tough. After 3 days we had become accustomed to the cabin, we knew where things were, we had our routine set and we knew the roads in the area. But Princess had us well prepared. Everything was packed up and ready to load in the car. The weather cooperated, no rain, so it was easy to pack the car. The drive to the NOC was easy and we were 15 minutes early. Our shuttle driver, Wiggy, was a previous thru-hiker who now runs the Nantahala Mountain Lodge, and we had a great conversation with him on the ride to Tellico. He knows the area and he knows what hikers need. If we actually do this hike again, I’m sure we will arrange to stay in his facility and he provides slack packing transportation from Franklin to Fontana. Despite weather forecasts to the contrary, today was another perfect hiking day. Chilly at the outset and then very comfortable after the first climb. We had an initial climb up to Wesser Bald (we bypassed the observation tower which was off-trail), and then a long descent, It’s a good thing it was long since the elevation dropped 2,500 ft. Portions of the descent were a little tricky and there were opportunities to make a bad mistake. There was a point where the trail made a turn that I didn’t recognize and after about a half dozen steps I realized that except for a few small bushes, there was no was to go any further except straight down. So I took a few photos of the incredible long-range view and then retreated back to the trail. Later I realized that I had discovered what is know as the “Jumpoff”. For the most part, the trail today was well-maintained, relatively easy and we made pretty good time for us, just a little over 20 minute miles.Just a little before the Jumpoff, we passed a hiker that Princess has met several times named Scooter, and I’ve included her photo. She’s from New Hampshire, so she’s very familiar with the rocky climbs and descents, and she’s basically hiking home. Later in the hike, as we navigated around a sweeping turn in a section of open woods, Princess saw a hiker some distance ahead of us approach an orange object on the trail. He stopped and picked it up and as we came up to him, Princess recognized the orange object as a ground cover that belonged to “The Spaniard”, another hiker she has seen several times. The hiker who picked it up had a really huge pack, so Princess volunteered to tote the ground cover on to NOC in hopes of connecting with The Spaniard. She saw him yesterday and knew that he couldn’t be too far ahead. So we rolled it up and stuck it in her pack.We finished the rest of the trail without notable incident and as we crossed the road to the NOC, Princess saw The Spaniard and hailed him. Sure enough he recognized his ground cover immediately. He realized that he had dropped it, but didn’t know where and wasn’t willing to go back looking for it. He was very appreciative and offered her a coffee in gratitude, and she suggested that a beer would be preferable. So it came to be that we were in the bar at the NOC while she was slugging down a draft at 11:00 in the morning. I was driving, so I abstained. We had a fun conversation with The Spaniard. He is from Malaga, Spain and has hiked for a very long time in many places. Last year (I believe) he did the Pacific Crest Trail, quite a feat - longer than the AT, more remote and more scenic. Its one of the “triple crown” hikes in the US. He gave us a lot of good pointers regarding the El Camino hike in Spain, something that we would like to do in the future. When Princess finished her beer, he was ready to get back on the trail, so we said our goodbyes and he headed on up the trail. We’re hoping that he will stay in touch.Following that excitement, we hopped in our car, made a quick excursion to our starting point for tomorrow’s hike (to be sure we know exactly how to get there) and headed on into Bryson City to check into our new accommodations at the Fryemont Inn. We stayed at the Fryemont last year when Ranger and Gay were with us so it was somewhat familiar, although this time we’re in a different building. After settling in and cleaning up, we headed out for a few supplies and then we got a text from Grasshopper, a 2014 thru-hiker who hiked with us for over a month. We’ve communicated intermittently since then and he has been following this journal. He realized that we are not far from his home and he decided to came out for a hike in the same area and see if we could hook up. A couple of hours later, he joined us at the Nantahala Brewing Company and we downed some pints with him and his hiking partner, Kelly. We had a great time sharing old and new stories and later we segued into an Italian dinner. He hopes to do the PCT this year and we wish him luck. We may have an opportunity to hike with him in the next couple of weeks. It was really good to see him and we all had a great evening.","Tellico Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526318,"When we left our room at the Bryson City Fryemont Inn at about 6:30 am, it was cold and dark. By the time we reached our starting point at Stecoah Gap, it was colder but lighter, with the sun lurking just below the horizon and a very clear sky. This section between the NOC and Stecoah is a long, tough climb from either end. But we picked the easier end and hiked SoBo together. It’s easier because Stecoah Gap is 1,432 ft higher than NOC, although the Cheowah Bald in between is over 5,000 ft, so both directions involve significant climbs and descents. The temp dropped as we climbed and the wind picked up near the top. The rhododendron leaves were starting to curl, an indication of the freezing point. My wool mittens weren’t quite enough to keep my fingers warm and eventually I had to pull my arm warmers down over them. It took us nearly half the hike to get to Cheowah Bald and by then the sun was beaming and it was considerably warmer, perhaps mid-40’s. The first hiker we met was The Spaniard. Yesterday, Princess recovered his ground cloth and returned it to him. Today he had it stowed securely inside his backpack, no chance of losing it again. We really like him and hope to see him again, but he’s moving quickly and we’re jumping around so it may not happen. After that we saw dozens of hikers since almost everyone is headed NoBo at this point. The climbs today were very tiring. We have lightweight slack-packs (essentially day-packs), while the backpackers are heavily loaded with 25 to 30 lbs on their backs. The difference is pronounced as they struggle to keep moving up. Hiker etiquette suggests that when hikers meet on the trail, the climbing hiker has priority and the descending hiker should step to the side. But almost every climbing hiker we met waved us on and took advantage of the opportunity to catch their breath.Further along in the hike, we saw Shaggy again. His parents are friends of ours back in Norfolk, so we always try to get a pic when we see him, and I've included his pic. He was moving pretty well today. He camped about a half-mile above NOC last night in a rocky area where there was protection from the wind, and he said he could hear the water rushing down the Nantahala Gorge not far below. He plans to be in Fontana tomorrow, so we may see him there. But we are rearranging our plans, so we may not see him beyond that point. We also saw Scooter again near the top of her climb. She was moving well too, it seems that her New Hampshire experience is serving her well in these mountains.While the uphill hike was tiring for us, the downhill side had some tricky spots. It was mostly dry, but with occasional rock outcroppings and roots that complicated the steep slope. There were also several sections through rockfalls. I haven’t heard that term before, but I don’t know a better way to describe them other than maybe a rockslide. It’s like someone poured a whole lot of big rocks onto the hillside and they flowed down and covered the trail. The rocks are usually large and generally secure enough to walk on without shifting, but they’re also at random angles and random sizes so it can be hard to find good footing and stay balanced. Hiking poles can be more of a hindrance than a help, and I’ve snapped carbon fiber poles in these rock fields. Wallace (NC) may be able to provide more info about them, but regardless of what they’re called they can be a problem to walk across. All things considered, we were satisfied with our pace today. We did the 13.4 miles in just over 5 hours. When we reached the NOC, we had some time to kill until Wiggy picked us up and we sat outside in the sun and people-watched for a while. The NOC was a beehive of activity. Hikers, kayakers, rafters, all sorts of people were milling around. We recognized a few of the hikers from the trail and exchanged greetings. Wiggy arrived on time and drove us back to our car at Stecoah Gap, then we snapped a photo and bid him goodbye. After checking out tomorrow’s route, we headed back to our room in Bryson City. And tonight we’re getting ready to depart tomorrow morning and move on to Hot Springs.","NOC

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526484,"Bryson City was pretty much kaput yesterday (Sunday) afternoon after our hike. The Nantahala Brewery and the Italian restaurant were about the only things open in town - but that was enough. We brought a couple carry-out dinners into the brewery and paired them with NoonDay IPA. All was well.We left the Fryemont this morning in the dark and drove to Princess’ NoBo starting point at Stecoah Gap. Then I took the car to our end point at Fontana and headed SoBo back toward her: a key-swap day. Yesterday we heard rumors of a very cold evening, low 20’s. That was not even close. Hi 30’s at the start, climbing into the 60’s by lunch, with very little wind. We’ve actually had a series of really great hiking days.Today was a pretty fun hike in both directions. Princess had the hardest climb, up Jacob’s Ladder. This certainly isn’t the longest or highest climb, about 700 ft up in about a half mile. But it feels like it’s straight up. With a heavy pack, it can be hard to just stay on your feet, much less move forward. There are some log steps and the rest is hard packed dirt. For Princess it was at about the 1 mile mark into her hike, for me it came close to the end of my hike. The previous 2 years I’ve done it NoBo, so I climbed up. This was the first time I’ve gone downhill, and it was a little creepy. I was pretty certain that if I ever tripped or slipped, I’d never be able to stop sliding down the hill. Fortunately, I didn’t. I met 3 NoBo’s headed up and 2 of the 3 were stopped trying to catch their breath. The other fun point for me was Bushnell Knob. It’s pretty rocky with some fun sections picking your way over fallen trees and around ledges and a little mud. A taste of Maine, good practice. The rest of the hike was neat, I had a steady climb of about 2,000 ft and some great scenic views of Fontana Lake and the surrounding hills. And I took more photos than usual, the sky was beautiful. I met Scooter and Shaggy, this will probably be the last time we see them since we’re jumping forward. And I saw probably 40 other hikers heading NoBo, no one going SoBo. After we finished, we headed for Hot Springs, our next base. Along the way we checked out some of the local roads up toward the AT, but without much success. So we continued to Hot Springs and went straight to the outfitters in town. We’ve used their shuttle services for the past 2 years and we hope to use them again so we can do some hiking together along this stretch of the AT. They are very accommodating and we have a tentative schedule for the rest of the week. We’re headed out at 6:00 am tomorrow and we should be able to hike together.I don’t remember if I’ve explained our jumping ahead, so I’ll try now. We managed to get a group hiking permit (via a lottery) for the John Muir Trail in California starting Sept. 5. The JMT should take us about 3 weeks and we’ll have to go a week or two ahead to get acclimated to the altitude. We still plan to finish the AT, but we want to summit Mt. Katahdin before we leave for JMT since the Katahdin weather is fickle after September and they often close the trail at some point in October. Our current goal is to summit Katahdin by the end of July. So we’re going to jump ahead and then come back in October to finish the sections we bypass now. Today we jumped about 5 days ahead by skipping the Smokey Mountains. We planned to do this anyway since we can’t slack through this area. We have friends who want to camp, so we’ll come back in the fall and spend 3 nights in the woods with them. But we need to skip much further ahead. We already have plans to return to Norfolk for several appointments on the weekend of April 16, so after the weekend we plan to resume hiking at Harpers Ferry in WVA. This means we’ll postpone almost the entire state of VA until after JMT. As of now, our JMT crew is Princess and I, Ranger and Howie, a friend and former colleague of Princess. If one of us drops out for some unavoidable reason, we have several possible alternates including Spartacus from last year. Princess has wanted to do the Pacific Crest Trail for 2 years. Much of the JMT is coincident with the PCT. So this helps scratch that itch.","Stecoah Gap

(See yesterday's blog for an explanation of skipping the Smoky Mountains) Not a modern motel, but clean, has what we need, the price is right and it’s right behind the Spring Creek Tavern that has good food and good beers. After cleanup, we had a pleasant conversation at the tavern with Bumpy, a lawyer from NC. He just started hiking at I-40 and came in to watch NC play Villanova in the NCAA finals. We stayed longer than planned and left around half-time. We found out later that NC came up short at the end. Sorry Bumpy.We woke up early as usual this AM to much colder temps and headed down the road at 5:30 to the Smoky Mountain Diner. They don’t open until 6:30, but they let us in for a good cup of hot coffee and we came back later after our hike for lunch. Dan, our shuttle driver from Bluff Mountain Outfitters was right on time, he opened up the store (a co-owner) and then he drove to Lemon Gap and we followed him in our car. It’s really a pleasure working with the shuttle services that are listed in the AT Guide (by AWOL). The drivers are very good, they know their areas like the back of their hand, they know the condition of the roads, where to park and they can provide options to help you plan. Plus they can tell you a lot about the region you’re traveling through.The highlight of our hike today was Max Patch summit. This is an unusual feature and everyone seems to have their own story about it. We’ve hiked it 3 times now, twice NoBo and once SoBo, so we’re becoming familiar with it’s approaches. The bald sits atop a very large, open hilltop and it’s a climb to the bald from either direction on the trail. It seems almost a mile across from one edge to the other. Our first hike across was bitterly cold, there was snow on top and a nasty wind. It was clear and the long-range views were great, but too cold to stop for a picture. Last year, less wind but very thick fog and we had a hard time seeing from one blaze to the next - no views. Today was warmer than the first year, hovering close to freezing, but the wind was fierce and the windchill on the open bald made it seem much colder. I had to pull on mittens for a second layer, yet I was still able to squeeze off a couple of pics. There was a light mist in the air, and it was freezing on the grass at the edge of the trail. We could see much farther than last year, but the clouds were hanging low on the surrounding mountains. When we reached the edge at the other side of the bald, we found that our water tubes had frozen shut - so it was freezing.The remainder of the (short) hike was mostly downhill through rhodo groves and below the ridge lines, and the sun started popping through, so it got warmer. The trail was clear and we made good time back to Lemon Gap. Along the way we spotted more flowers along the trail, including the first trilliums that we’ve seen this year. I’ve included a shot of a red trillium that is just beginning to blossom. The weather has been unseasonably warm and that may be a problem if it snows as predicted this weekend. As we were taking off our shoes and climbing into the car, a group of young ladies in a couple of cars pulled into the parking area behind us. We learned that they were volunteers helping maintain the trail. Their task today was pulling up invasive plant species along the trail. We encountered this before in PA where a group was pulling up a species of mustard plant. Keeping the trail in shape takes a lot.Back in Hot Springs, we stopped first at the Smoky Mountain Diner for lunch. This has to be one of the high points in this whole area. Princess has a “piled-high” club sandwich and I had the homemade meatloaf. If you ever find yourself in Hot Springs, NC, do not fail to eat at the diner. Everything is great. PLUS: they had our summit postcard picture posted on the wall. The last 2 years we’ve seen Biscuit (a hiker), who we learned is also the owner. We really like her.","Brown Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526726,"Today was a chance to hike together again. Whenever we’re staying in a trail town (where the trail goes directly through the town) we have 2 opportunities to hike together without paying extra shuttle fees. In either case, we hire a shuttler to take us to an access point on the trail that’s a hikeable distance from the town (either north or south of town) and then we hike back into town. Today, for example, Dan was our driver again, and he picked us up at our motel and drove us to the trailhead at Lemon Gap (where we finished yesterday) where he dropped us off. Then we spent the next 4 hours hiking 14+ miles NoBo back into Hot Springs and our motel. We’ll have one more chance to do this (on Friday) when Dan takes us out to Allen Gap and we hike SoBo back into town. We started just a little later today, so the sun was up and the drive out was more interesting. Dan told us quite a bit about himself and the countryside along the way. He is from Connecticut (I couldn’t find a trace of an accent), spent a number of years in the Air Force until he retired and then settled in Asheville, NC. For a while he and his brother ran rafting tours in the area. Then he said one day they realized that there was no outfitter in town and they decided to start a business. From our perspective, their store, Bluff Mountain Outfitters is one of the best on the trail. You can find virtually anything you need and they have good quality stock. Anyway, now I could tell you a great deal more than you would want to hear about Hot Springs. It certainly seems that he knows a lot about the town and the 685 folks who live here. I spent most of my youth in a small town and I don’t think that’s unusual.Back to the trail: cold start, high 30’s I think - warming eventually into the 50’s. The wind on the ridges and the windward side of the mountains was fierce. So we had to make continuous gear adjustments, gloves, arm warmers, etc. The first half of the hike was a lot of climbing, Mt. Walnut and Bluff Mountain were both over 4,000 ft. The second half was mostly descent, a lot of it through rhododendron groves and we were not as exposed to the wind. Overall we were pretty quick today, faster than usual at under 20-min miles. We both agreed afterwards that we should slow down and take it easy; unnecessary speed invites strains, injuries and so forth.We made it back into town in plenty of time for lunch at our favorite Smoky Mountain Diner. The meatloaf was so good yesterday that I ordered it again. Cleaning up after the hike and getting things ready for tomorrow’s hike took several hours. Then finally it was time to relax a bit at the Spring Creek Tavern. The town seems to be full of hikers. All shapes and sizes, some looking fit and trim, others looking haggard and exhausted.Tomorrow we hope to hike a section to the southern end of this stretch. We hope to drive to the Standing Bear Hostel just off I-40 and park the car there. We have tried to arrange a shuttle ride from the hostel to Brown Gap. Then we would hike together back from Brown Gap to the hostel, and drive back to Hot Springs. When we talked with the shuttler earlier today, they were optimistic that they could accommodate us, but we have to talk with them again this evening to confirm the reservation. Otherwise we will have to do an alternate section.PS: The shuttle is confirmed, so we will hike the Brown Gap to I-40 section SoBo. When we finish this, we will have hiked all of the AT from Springer Mtn to Hot Springs, except for 5 hikes in the Great Smoky Mountain Park. Next we’ll work on the Hot Springs to Erwin, TN section.","Lemon Gap
",Hot Springs,"Apr 06, Wed",14.80
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526887,"Today was the first day that our shuttle arrangements didn’t go exactly as planned. Everything eventually worked out, but our driver overslept and we started hiking an hour later than planned. We woke up an hour earlier than usual and left the motel in our car at 5:15 am. Based on advice, we took the long route to the Standing Bear Hostel, using NC 25 to Newport, TN and then I-40 east to Green Corner Road. The advice was worthwhile and it took us much less time than the shorter, more direct route using mountain roads. So we arrived at the hostel 15 min before we were scheduled to leave at 6:30 and it was a long wait until we finally left at 7:30 headed for Brown Gap. We had a short hike over average terrain and the weather was fine, so there was really no impact, except that we finished an hour later than we had expected. The most notable feature of the hike was Snowbird Mountain. There is a grassy bald at the top, and an FAA station off to one side. Later we saw large collections of trout lilies along the trail on the southern exposures. Spring is awakening.We did meet more hikers on the trail this morning. We were hiking SoBo again, so we passed all the NoBos. And it was a new group of hikers since we’ve jumped ahead about a week by postponing our hike through the Smokys. While we were waiting on the driver at the hostel, we talked with Joker. He’s a little concerned about the weather this weekend: cold (as in 20’s) and high winds are predicted, and he doesn’t have a sleeping bg. Later on the trail we met Terrible Lizard crossing Snowbird bald. She had just finished the tough climb up the mountain and was enduring the fierce wind on the top, but she was taking it all in stride and moving well. I wish I could remember all the other hikers we met, but I usually have to hear the trail names a couple of times to remember them.   Newport is a larger town than Hot Springs, so we stopped in Newport on the way home to stock up on groceries and gas, and to wash the car. And when we got back to Hot Springs we had our requisite lunch at the Smoky Mountain Diner. Then we did our chores with cleanup, laundry and gear. We entertained the possibility of a soak in the hot springs here in town. But the clock caught up with us, so we’ll do that tomorrow. Plus we’ve learned that Grasshopper, who we met in 2014 plans to meet us here in Hot Springs and to hike with us tomorrow. He is getting into shape for his PCT next month.We headed next door to the tavern where I started writing this journal entry (perhaps that explains how disjointed it is). The Spring Creek Tavern is fabulous, it must have a dozen IPAs, many of them on tap. I’ve been trying to check out the locally-brewed IPAs, but I’ve learned that’s a big job that may require several days. Sure enough, about an hour into my sampling, Grasshopper appeared, and that was the end of my creativity until now, much later when everyone else is asleep.So we’re hiking tomorrow with Grasshopper. If the weather holds out, Dan is going to shuttle us to Allen Gap, drop us off there and we will all hike back into Hot Springs. Its about 15 miles, so it will be longer than today and yesterday. There may be some rain overnight and when we start, but it should end mid-morning and we should be in the clear for the rest of the hike.","I-40 Underpass
",Brown Gap,"Apr 07, Thu",10.60
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526999,"We hiked today with a friend from our 2014 AT thru-hike. Grasshopper joined us in Harpers Ferry in 2014 and he hiked with us through much of PA. He met us again last week in Bryson City at the Nantahala Brewery and said he would like to hike a section with us again. He’s tuning up for a go at the PCT starting in mid-May. Last evening he drove in and joined us at the Spring Creek Tavern for dinner and a few brews. We had a great time reminiscing about our 2014 adventures and talking with the 2016 hikers drifting in and out of the tavern. I also had a chance to sample more IPAs from the local breweries. The weather is becoming a bigger factor each day. The pleasant temps we enjoyed for the last few days began to fade a little yesterday and the winds at higher elevations were really strong, although the sky remained clear most of the day. There was a spotty rain last night as the temps dropped into the 30’s, but it didn’t get cold enough for snow so we were ready to go this AM. Dan from Bluff Mountain drove the 3 of us out to Allen Gap and we disembarked for a 14.4 mile SoBo hike back into Hot Springs. Grasshopper carried his ultraLite backpack, but not with all the traditional gear. Instead he carried several pairs of candidate shoes for his PCT attempt. He hoped to try them out in a trail environment to see how they feel.Grasshopper has always been a bit faster than us and he took the lead out of Allen Gap. As we climbed, we started overheating, but it also got colder. We mostly climbed (with a couple of short descents) for 4 miles. Thermal control was tough, we had to shed some clothes as we heated up, yet the temp declined as we climbed and the wind on the open ridges was cold and strong. Princess stowed her windbreaker and used her arm-warmers to adjust to the temp. My biggest problem was cold hands, same problem that I’ve had before. Some TJ guests have suggested that it sounds like Reynaud’s syndrome, but I haven’t had an official diagnosis. However, I’ve learned that whenever I feel that my fingers are starting to get cold, I need to make some adjustments quickly to warm them up. If I don’t, and they get really cold and I’m going to suffer for a long time before they eventually warm up. So today, I wore a pair of OR gloves and when I began to feel a chill, I pulled a pair of heavy wool mittens over them. After a while, the mittens began to take effect and eventually my fingers got back to normal.Otherwise, the hike was pleasant and uneventful. We expected to see some of the hikers that we met in the tavern last night, but we didn’t recognize very many. The only ones we knew were Happy Jag and TreeHugger. Instead we saw a lot of new faces, and many hikers were still in tents or still in camp. Later in the hike as we neared Hot Springs, there were more hikers on the trail. Grasshopper kept count of the hikers he saw on trail or in camp and he was up to over 40 when we finally finished.The last part of the hike was quite pleasant. The sun was out, bright and warm, with a few fluffy white clouds. As we neared Hot Springs, we were on a ridge high above the city. The descent was pretty steep through rocky outcroppings and switchbacks, with several overlook points that provided impressive views of the city, the valley and the French Broad River that flows through the town. The river is quite wide and flows through a series of rocky steps that generates water noise that is audible from high on the ridge. The descent includes a promontory called “Lovers Leap” that offers quite a vista. The AT drops to the level of the river and then follows along the riveredge until it reaches the bridge that crosses into town. We had lunch with Grasshopper at the Smoky Mountain Diner before he headed back to his home. We had a good conversation through much of the hike and Grasshopper never had a good chance to try out his other hiking shoes. But overall, the hike was great and a good warmup hike for him. If all goes well with his PCT hike, he may come back and hike with us when we finish the AT sections we’ve missed after our JMT venture. After he left, we spent time at the tavern and then visited the Hot Springs Spa for a nice long soak in the “waters”. And then a really good supper at the tavern. Our hike tomorrow has become very dicey. We’ve had some rain this evening and the temps are supposed to hit freezing tonight. There is a likelihood of snow tonight. Dan, our shuttle driver won’t know until early tomorrow morning if he wants to shuttle us. So, we’ve been texting with him and we’ll see what he thinks in the AM. Our plan for tomorrow was to do a long hike, nearly 21 miles, so we need an early start to be sure that we can finish by the end of the day. If conditions aren’t right, we’ll take a zero here and rework our plan, probably postponing our long hike until Sunday.","Allen Gap
","Hot Springs, NC","Apr 08, Fri",14.40
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527089,"We finally decided to take a zero here in Hot Springs today. Yesterday we were concerned about today’s weather, the forecast was colder than yesterday, with snow at higher elevations and windy. Dan, our driver from Bluff Mountain Outfitters, gave us his text # and said that if it looked bad at 5:30 in the AM he would not go and let us know. We were up at 5:00, watching the weather and the forecast had changed. It was still relatively warm outside, 37 deg, and there had been rain. But the news called for very high winds at higher elevations. Like 25 sustained and gusts to 40 mph. Plus, we had over 10 miles at 4,000+ feet and the lapse rate would drop the temp up there into the 20’s. We have cold weather gear, but hiking 10 miles into strong winds at sub-freezing temps was just not appealing. We haven’t taken a zero yet and we decided that today was a good zero day and that Hot Springs is a good zero town. So we texted Dan and postponed the shuttle until tomorrow. The forecast is actually colder at the start tomorrow, but predicted to climb quickly and with much less wind. It’s our first hike over 20 miles, so we want an early start and it will likely take us much of the day.We slept in late and it felt really good. Then we had one more lunch at the Smoky Mountain Diner. Thanks to William from NC for his suggestions on “don’t miss items” in Hot Springs. I hope to use the afternoon to respond to some folks in the guest book. And to catch up on some chores from back home. We still expect to head back to Norfolk on Thursday (after a short hike), handle a few commitments on Friday, Saturday & Sunday, drive to DC on Monday, then up to Harpers Ferry on Tuesday where we’ll begin hiking again. This will put us about 3 weeks ahead of where we were last year at this time, so we should be able to finish Mt. Katahdin before the end of July. That will leave us about 6 weeks of hiking after we finish the JMT to complete the AT sections that we skip.The photo that I’ve included is from a couple of days ago. It’s Princess inside the Spring Creek Tavern & Inn where we’ve spent about 6 evenings this week. The images painted on the window are Amanda and Tim, the owners of the tavern. Tim’s favorite beer is an IPA and he has a large stock of local IPAs on tap and in cans. I’ve been slowly working my way through them and may be able to finish today.","Hot Springs, NC

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527374,"I’ve been working hard to get a couple paragraphs down every day early enough so that I can still get a good night’s sleep. As I think about it, one of the drawbacks of slack-packing the way we do is that it’s harder to find time to get the TJ writing done. When we were backpacking and stayed in shelters or tented every night, I had more time. Especially early in the year when it got dark around 6:30 and it was too cold to sit outside for very long. Now, when we finish hiking, we have a shuttle ride (or take our car) to wherever we’re staying, shower, do the laundry, get something to eat, and frequently we spend some time talking to our hosts. So now, it’s 10:30, I’m just starting to write and I need to be in bed so that I’m ready to get up at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning.What about today’s hike? It was long for us, we did 20.4 miles and we kept a pretty good pace. That’s the longest so far this year and we’re both pretty beat. Our biggest concern this morning was the cold. The temp really took a nosedive last night and dropped into the 20s in some places around us. The apple orchards were in jeopardy and I haven’t heard how much damage they sustained. In Hot Springs it was expected to hit freezing or below, although it was still around 35 to 37 when we woke up at 5. The wind was very low and not a factor. So we put on a lot of layers. Our shuttle driver, Dan, led us to Allen Gap where we parked our car and then he took us to Devil Fork Gap where we started to hike SoBo back to our car. Fortunately, we had a 5 to 7 mile uphill climb at the start, so we really warmed up quickly. Then my problem was thermal control, since I was already sweating underneath, so I had to peel off layers carefully so that I didn’t get chilled from the damp layers. It’s a long story, but it all worked out.As we climbed we went through areas where it was above freezing, then followed by a much colder area. As we neared the top of Big Butt Mountain, there was some residual snow cover from yesterday’s storms. It was mostly in the shadows and we didn’t see much more after we passed that peak. We passed through a couple of balds/meadows and I took a number of pictures since one in particular was quite striking. Later in the hike we crossed over Firescald, an exposed ridge line that is very rocky. In some places the ridge line is very narrow and totally exposed on both sides. I can only imagine what it must have been like yesterday when the winds were 25+ mph sustained and gusting to 40 or more. There is actually a “bad weather” trail that passes below and around the ridge because it is so dangerous in bad weather. But when we hiked it later today, it was quite nice and climbing through the 50’s into the 60’s. The sky was clear and we had great visibility for miles and miles. I tried to capture how daunting some of the rocks are in photos, but my pics don’t do them justice. Also, after doing Mew Hampshire and Maine, the rocks don’t seem to be so difficult.Most of the hike was either through open forest trails, or through dense rhododendron groves. In the beginning, the rhodos felt great because they tended to hold some warmth and blocked any wind that showed up. Later in the day they felt great because they blocked the sun and were refreshingly cool. Overall, the hike was mostly very long uphill climbs or downhill descents. We packed our gear this morning and said goodbye to Hot Springs as we headed out to our hike. After we finished, we drove from Allen Gap to Erwin, TN where we’ll stay for the next 4 days. We have come back to the Cantarrosa Farm where we stayed last year for the first time. Cantarrossa is one of our favorite places and I’ll say more about it tomorrow. Peggy and Mike are terrific hosts and we absolutely love staying here. So I’m going to quit now. The extreme cold weather seems to be behind us now and the only problem on the horizon now is rain on Tuesday. Usually not fun, but more manageable.","Devil Fork Gap
",Allen Gap,"Apr 10, Sun",20.40
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527452,"After staying our first night this year at the Cantarroso Farm, it’s even better than we remembered. Peggy & Mike have a beautiful house and grounds, right on the banks of the Nolichucky River. The huge windows on the front of their house face the rapids at a turn of the river. Once again, we were lucky enough to get their upstairs room. They also have accommodations on the ground floor, and added a second cabin this year. Peggy would like to hike the JMT this year, but has conflicts and we hope that she may be able to join us for some sections of the VA AT when we return in the fall. Mike has expanded his apiaries and knows everything beewise. He almost got us into suits to help him with the hives this afternoon. So if you’re headed to Erwin, TN and looking for a really nice place to stay, check out Cantarroso. About the only thing different in our stay this year is that we’re doing most of our own transportation. Having our car has given us more flexibility to find out what’s in town, try out the local restaurants, visit the coffeeshop, etc. We’ll be hiking here for two more days, then on Thursday we have to head back to Norfolk for several appointments. Today seemed like a lot of uphill for both of us, even though we did a key swap and hiked the same section in opposite directions. For me, the first 6 or 7 miles seemed like a continuous climb, although it wasn’t quite. But the features and views from the top of the climbs were well worth the effort. I really enjoyed the view from the first meadow with the AT winding around in front of me and heading up another hill (including 2 hikers for perspective). The long-range views from the balds were amazing. It’s too bad that I don’t know how to capture the incredible sense of distance that I feel when I see range after range of mountains, each one farther away, stretching to the horizon. The valley views are great too, the hillsides are closer and it’s much easier to see their contours - especially early in the day when the sun angle is low and the shadows accent the shapes. And when it’s a partly cloudy day, the cloud shadows play over the mountainsides drifting in and out of the draws and hollows. This is the third year that I’ve tried to capture all of this in photos and it’s still not working. I guess that’s part of why I keep coming back. The photos trigger memories, but I think you have to be there to really feel it. Another feature today was High Rocks. It’s near the north end of the section. It’s a smaller peak that’s sandwiched between Spivey Gap and Little Bald. The last few feet of the climb are rocky and there is a massive rock or cluster of rocks at the very top. We remember it because it’s one of the few places where we were able to get cell reception to call as shuttle driver in past years. The upper part of the descent from High Rock is pretty steep, with a lot of rock steps and log steps. Mud would be a real problem here in the rain. I talk a lot about weather, but it’s pretty important to us, and the forecast of rain for tomorrow is not pleasant. Rain isn’t a show-stopper (like high winds or lots of ice), and we have gear for it - but hiking in the rain isn’t the most fun thing for us. Ziplock bags are life savers and we can keep the critical stuff dry. But after hours in rain, most of what you’re wearing ends up wet. I’ve tried different approaches, but my Zpack poncho seems to work best for me. I’m tall, so I’ve ordered a poncho that’s extra long and that helps somewhat. The concept behind the poncho is that it keeps the rain out, but it provides enough air circulation underneath the poncho so that you don’t end up soaked with sweat (that’s what happened when I wore a rain jacket and rain pants). Simply put, if I’m hiking uphill for any length of time, I’m going to sweat a lot. I also got the Zpack kilt to try to stay dry down to my knees. That didn’t do much for me, it cut down the air circulation into the poncho. Ultimately, I don’t know how to keep dry in an all-day rain. But if the rain is light or intermittent, the poncho works pretty well. And it covers my pack so that stays dry.Over and above the personal comfort, rain can make parts of the trail more dangerous. Mud can make a steep incline treacherous, especially the downhill direction. And wet rocks cab be as slippery as ice if moss or leaves are involved. I get virtually no traction on wet roots and I won’t put my foot on a log step if it’s not cross-cut or roughened. So I’m not looking forward to tomorrow, at least we have a short day. I’ll let you know how it goes.","Sams Gap
",Spivey Gap,"Apr 11, Mon",13.40
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527686,"Sure enough, the predicted rain was in progress when we woke up today. I figured the best course of action was more sleep, but an hour and a half later nothing had changed except the ground was wetter. Eventually, we made it to Devil Fork Gap where Princess dropped me off and she headed on to leave the car at Sams Gap. The rain was light, but steady and in the low 50’s. For the next 3 or 4 miles, I was climbing. It wasn’t a tough climb (with a slack pack), just long and I passed several hikers who were struggling under full backpacks. There were no long-range views because of the mist, but the hillside that I could see was quite nice and contoured around the hillside. I started just above 3,000 ft and climbed up to around 4,500 with a number of smaller ups and downs. The last 2 miles was a descent for me. A few sections were relatively steep and I had to take it slow because of the mud and slippery conditions. At that point the rain was over, but the mist still hung close and the tress were still dripping. I could hear the interstate a long way before I reached Sams gap.There weren’t too many features along the way. I saw a few tents still set up with folks inside and I actually met more hikers going south than I passed going north. Early in the hike I passed a sign to a new hostel, and also a sign cautioning hikers about dogs. The sign wasn’t cautioning hikers about angry dogs, it turns out the problem was that pet dogs were following hikers and then getting killed on the road - so hikers were asked to discourage friendly dogs from following them. The sign said that a local boy had lost 4 dogs already this year. I also encountered a day hiker headed south about 2 miles from Sams Gap who was spreading trail magic. He had a tray full of donuts and cinnamon buns and he also had apples and bananas. Any other day his goodies would have been gone in 20 minutes, but today there just weren’t many hikers on the trail. For several miles along the trail there was an old barbed wire fence along one side of the trail. Later, the fence was on the opposite side and in some places, the old rusty barbed wire had been cut and rolled up. I remember from 2 years ago that Ranger told us this fence marked the state line between Tennessee and N. Carolina. It’s in the open forest and I’ve never asked anyone why it was put up. I also passed a large engraved stone beside the trail about a half mile from Sams Gap. It indicated that this section of the trail had been donated by the Moye family. It was inscribed with a very reverent and appreciative statement from the Moye family regarding the beauty and peace of the forest in this area. I talked a little yesterday about my rain gear. Even with my poncho, I still couldn’t manage to stay dry. I just sweat too much when I’m doing a long, steady climb. The poncho provides a lot of circulation underneath, but when the air is so humid I just don’t dry. The rain was chilly, so I stayed warm, and my pack stayed dry so that’s good news.As soon as I got to the car and stopped hiking, I started to get cold. The temp had only gone up a degree to two. By the time I picked her up and got back to Cantarroso, I was ready for a hot shower. After cleanup we headed into Erwin and had some good BBQ at Hawg ’n Dawg, and we stopped just down the street at Steel Rails for a hot latte. Life is good. Back at the Cantarroso I crashed and slept for a couple of hours, it was great to be clean, warm, dry and prone. During the course of the day, several other hikers came in: Fancy Pants and Cheap ’n Easy. We met them several days ago at the Creekside Courts in Hot Springs. At that point they were Matt and Nick, but they got trail names today. Later we all went out to the Primo, an Italian restaurant a couple of miles away and Peggy and Mike joined us. We’re still trying to talk Peggy into joining us at some point along the trail this year. At one point she thought she could do the JMT, but she had a conflict, then she wanted to hike Maine with us, but Mike reminded her of another conflict. So now, she may do some parts of Virginia or the Smokies when we come back later this fall. Eventually I’m sure we’ll find a way to hook up. So we have one more day here, tomorrow we’re doing the NoBo section into Erwin. We’ll stay here tomorrow night and then head back to Norfolk on Thursday.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527764,"The featured photo shows Crazy Carl standing beside his hammock behind the No Business Knob Shelter on the AT. A number of AT hikers have taken to hammocks as an alternative to tents & shelters. I’ve never tried a hammock, but the proponents swear that they’re just as warm, dry and comfortable, and that they’re more flexible than tents. More flexible meaning that all they require are 2 sturdy attach points a reasonable distance apart, compared to tent sites that prefer a bigger, reasonably flat footprint, without protruding roots or rocks, and ground that’s not too hard or too soft to hold the stakes. Hammocks can have rain covers, bug shields and insulating pads and they seem to set up more quickly than a tent. But since I’m not a user I can’t make a fair assessment. My only complaint regarding hammocks is that 2 years ago, Four Fingers came into a shelter very late, when everyone else was asleep and set up his hammock inside the shelter (where it was warmer). All night long hikers were cursing and swearing (myself included) when they ran unsuspecting into his hammock in the dark as they were headed out for a privy run. I’m including the topic here for those of you who are considering a future AT hike and making gear decisions for yourself. Talk with your outfitter, and then talk with other hammock users before you decide. (PS: you’re not supposed to camp above treelike in the Whites)The rains have vanished and today dawned chilly (30’s) and then warmed to the 70’s. I dressed warmly to start and then shed layers quickly as I made the first climb. By mid-morning I was down to a hiking tee and biking gloves and I almost unzipped my pants-legs. The section that we did today (Spivey Gap to Erwin) was in great shape, with little trace of yesterday’s rains. Princess and I did the key swap, we each had an initial climb (although she started about 1,500 ft below my start elevation). She is having problems with swelling on the top of her foot. It may have started several days ago when her laces were too tight. Downhills, particularly steep ones cause her more discomfort. Today she cut a slit in the top of her trail runners and she said it felt fine. Since we’re headed home for the next 5 days and won’t be back on trail until Tuesday, she will have a chance to RICE (rest, ice, compress, elevate). This section is a favorite of mine with a number of good memories from previous hikes with Ranger and WyeKnot. The final descent starts from a point high above the valley and offers a number of overlook points with great views of the Nolichucky River and Erwin as the trail winds all the way down to the river. Mike still has the boot warmer that WyeKnot built for him last year and today we drove past the ice cream shop where Ranger talked Marie, our shuttle driver into stopping for a milk shake at 7:00 in the morning. I mentioned the trail being in great shape because the maintainers on this section are friends with Peggy & Mike, our hosts here at Cantarroso. And Peggy & Mike occasionally help them keep the growth trimmed back, etc. I did notice specific places along the trail where the runaway/drainage channels had been freshly raked, a stretch where a number of rocks had been pulled up from the trail and moved to the side (something you don’t find in PA), and a number of places where small stones had been spread to improve footing and cut down on mud. Plus I didn’t have to duck as I passed through any of the rhododendron groves. Our hats are off to all the trail clubs and maintainers all along the AT who volunteer to keep the trail in shape. Our hike was fairly short again today, we decided to stop in Erwin. It’s a good end point when we start up again in October after the JMT. We headed straight downtown and had the Wednesday special at the Hawk ’n Dawg. And now we’re playing vacation, napping and sipping IPA. Early tomorrow we head back to Norfolk, about a 7 hour drive from here. I plan to take a breather from the journal until we get back on trail at Harpers Ferry next Tuesday. Take a hike this weekend.","Spivey Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528834,"We were back on the trail today after a nice weekend back home in Norfolk. I had a doctor’s appointment that turned out to be nothing (fortunately). And we had a chance to see a production of Shakespeare’s Tempest that was absolutely fabulous. Princess was sick for about 2 days, that wasn’t so nice. But we were able to spend time with our friends, and thoroughly enjoyed that. I spent a couple of hours on Saturday at the Smartmouth Brewery and renewed my association with Rule G IPA. And we took care of a number of local chores, spent an evening in DC with my nephew and then drove here to Harpers Ferry early this morning. We split our hike into 2 sections today. You may remember that we jumped forward in our northbound progression on the AT so that we can finish Mt. Kathadin during the summer in good weather. Otherwise, we would have to climb it in October, after we do the JMT, and that’s too late in the year for Katahdin. Since we’re coming back from a long weekend, and we had to drive from DC to Harpers Ferry, we planned to do something short today. So we decided to do West Virginia from Keys Gap (the WV/VA state line) into Harpers Ferry. We drove straight to the parking lot near the Shenandoah River bridge, I dropped off Princess and she started hiking southbound. Then I drove back across the bridge and up the hill to Keys Gap where I left the car for her to pick up. Everything went as planned, I met her on the trail halfway through and then I continued hiking northbound to the bridge parking lot where she was waiting with the car. At that point, it was mid-morning, it was pleasant, the sun was out, etc. So we decided to do another short key swap section. This section was only 4 miles from the bridge parking lot, through Harpers Ferry, across the Potomac Bridge, along the C&O canal towpath and then up a short distance to the parking lot at the base of Weverton Cliffs. She did it northbound and I did it southbound. Most of this section is on the towpath (almost 3 miles) and it becomes pretty boring. The towpath is gravel and quite level without features. The only things interesting are the Potomac River rapids and the turtles in the canal. The town of Harpers Ferry is interesting and the AT goes right through the old historic downtown area where the armory that John Brown attacked is located. The trail also passes by Jefferson’s Rock and there is a side trail to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy that’s located in Harpers Ferry. We each took more pics than usual, and we were finished with our hike and ready for trouble before noon. Our most difficult task today was finding a place to park our car, that took a while - there is not much room for car parking in the old part of the town. We stayed again at one of our favorite haunts, The Towns Inn on High Street. It’s right in the heart of old town, but all the activity is during the day, and they roll up the sidewalks after dark. There are only a couple of restaurants/bars in town and one of them burned since we were last here. The Towns Inn used to keep their restaurant and bar open late, but now they’re closing at 7:00. We’re only scheduled to be here for 2 nights, so I guess we will survive. The Towns Inn has made some significant changes since last year. They’ve upgraded their guest rooms a bit, but they’e still quaint. They now have 2 buildings, one houses the B&B rooms and currently the restaurant. The other houses the hiker hostel and resupply. But construction continues and there will be more changes in the near future.Tomorrow’s hike is a bit longer. We finished West Virginia today, so tomorrow we’ll push on further into Maryland, we hope to get as far as Turner’s Gap. Princess liked splitting the key swap into 2 sections, so we’ll try that again tomorrow. There is a convenient breakpoint about midway through tomorrow’s hike - so we’ll split it into 2 key-swap sections. There’s one long climb up Weverton Cliffs, I don’t know who’ll do that. She tends to prefer the climbs since it’s easier on her sore foot. Tomorrow has some interesting civil war sites, some state parks and monuments. Plus we plan to stop by the AT Conservancy here in Harpers Ferry after the hike.","Key Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528995,"We liked the hiking strategy we used yesterday so much that we decided to try it again today. So I’ll provide a few more details for those of you who are interested, others can skip to the next paragraph. Our goal is to break a longer section (say 15 mi for example) into 2 shorter subsections and then use the key swap technique for each subsection. The benefits are that we get to see each other three times during the hike instead of just one time (if we only use one key swap for the whole section), and it also forces us to take a breather at the midway point. Plus, we keep water bottles in the car, so we can camel up at the break point between the sections. The strategy is only possible when there is a good secondary road that crosses the AT reasonably close to the midpoint of the full section. If we used a single key swap strategy for the 14 mi section we did today, we would have just seen each other once as we passed midway through a 5 or 6 hour hike. Instead we passed once during the initial subsection, then we met again at the halfway point when we switched drivers, and we passed each other during the second subsection. We could have eliminated the driver switch at the midpoint, but we like the break opportunity. So we’ll probably use it as often as possible (i.e., when there is a reasonable midway access road). Since we each hiked one subsection NoBo and the other subsection SoBo, I’ll just talk about the total section as if we went NoBo only. So the starting point was the parking lot at the base of Weverton Cliffs. We’ve done the climb up to the cliffs probably 4 or 5 times now. I still remember how hard I thought it was the first time that we did it. Now it still seems steep, but much shorter - I was at the trail to the cliffs sooner than I expected. But I didn’t take the side trail, I already have ample pics from previous visits so I continued on. Then there’s another mile or two of uphill that’s less steep, but pretty rocky, so it can be tiring. After that, it levels out with fewer rocks and it’s mostly rolling ridgeline, up and down to Gathland State Park. There are some rocky sections, but no sustained, tough uphills. Gathland Park is interesting, very picturesque. Thee are a number of structures including a large pavilion, a mausoleum, decent restrooms, a building, a meadow, the ruins of an old structure, and several parking areas. Certainly the most impressive structure is the War Correspondents Memorial, a tall structure with a lot of features. I’ve included a photo, it’s not my best effort (the sun angle wasn’t good), but it gives a sense of the scale of the monument. The grounds around this area are neat and very well kept. Thru-hikers usually stop here to use the privy and stock up on water - there is a pump with potable water. It’s a comfortable place to hang out, catch a nap or chat with other hikers on the benches under the trees or the pavilion. Today it was our mid-point. Heading north from Gathland, the trail climbs a little to White Rock Cliff (I didn’t see a sign, so I was never quite sure where the cliff was) and then starts a relatively long but slow descent toward the Dahlgren Campground. This is a backpacker’s campground, but it has restrooms, picnic tables and water. Plus it’s about a quarter mile from a good access road and parking lot at Turners Gap. This was our northern point today.One item I mentioned last year was the extent of the Civil War history that took place in this area. Gen. Lee made a foray into this area and the result was a series of significant battles around South Mountain. Two generals were killed here, one from the Confederacy and one from the Union. Lee’s strategies and McClellan’s responses led to the battle at Antietam. It’s hard not to hike through here and think about what it might have been like over 150 years ago with soldiers from both sides swarming up and down these hills. There are not many other hikers on the trail, compared to a few weeks ago in NC and TN when we were in the midst of the March hiker bubble. Harpers Ferry did have a “Flip Flop Festival” this past weekend for hikers who choose to start hiking north from Harpers Ferry to Mt. Katahdin, then return to Harpers Ferry and hike south to Mt. Springer at the end of the summer. This strategy has been promoted as a way of easing the glut of hikers that start at Springer in March and April and saturate the shelters and campgrounds. Starting midway at Harpers Ferry gives hikers the advantage of summer weather for the northern states and then gives them cooler fall temps to finish the southern states. We encountered several hikers who have just started their flip flop. After the hike today, we stopped by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters in Harpers Ferry to register and have our ceremonial photo taken in front of the building. The ATC HQ is just a short side trail (blue blaze) from the AT and it’s worth a short visit to look around. They have lots of hiker friendly stuff and a giant relief map of the entire trail. You can run your fingers over the bumps in the Smokies and in the Whites. It’s a little foreboding. So now it’s hiker midnight in Harpers Ferry and nothing is happening outside. It’s a scenic place, beautiful in the morning light, but absolutely dead at night. Perhaps we’re just a little too early for the tourist season?","Weverton Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529157,"Adieu to Harpers Ferry for the time being. We were up at 5:00 this morning, just slightly before we saw the lights come on at the train station. We were packed and set to go, had the car loaded and were on the road by 6:00. The Towns Inn has been a frenzy of activity while we were here. Karen has made major changes to the layout of the inn and has been putting the finishing touches on the interior. A major magazine will be on site this weekend to do a feature story on the inn and workmen have been busy virtually around the clock to get ready. The workmen haven’t really disturbed us and the improvements are dramatic. I just hope the rates don’t go up too much.Our starting point today was Turners Gap, and the end point was Wolfsville Road, so we hiked a total of 13.4 miles. It was warmer than yesterday at the start, but the sun came and went, and later in the hike there were a few sprinkles. It seems that the Maryland sections of the AT are well-used and the trails are in great shape. Some portions were a virtual thoroughfare: dry, hard-packed clay, with a 5 ft-wide flat trail. That’s not to say that there weren’t rocks, some sections were very rocky. But overall it was a very pleasant hike. The Maryland trail clubs and their volunteers are to be commended for doing a first rate job. I need to be sure to relay that info to the ATC. We did another double key-swap again today. One subsection was from Turners Gap to a parking lot at the I-70 crossing, and the other was from that crossing to Wolfsville Road. Today, I hiked both sections NoBo and Princess did both SoBo. We like it, it has some benefits for us. But it’s not always possible if there isn’t a good road crossing at a reasonable midway point. There were a couple of points of interest. Washington Monument was about 2 miles into the hike. It sits atop a hill in a state park with quite nice facilities, restrooms, a visitor center (closed), picnic tables, etc. There are a series of signs along the section of AT leading up the hill to the actual monument that highlight events in Washington’s life. The monument is slightly off the trail and I didn’t go up this year (for the first time). But it’s an impressive stone tower and I was close enough for a photo. The other feature was Annapolis Rocks. This site features campsites tended by a caretaker and is advertised as a terrific overlook. But it is a quarter mile off trail, and I was anxious to be done for the day. A third feature that I note every year is crossing I-70. I used I-70 for many decades and the footbridge across the interstate is marked as the Appalachian Trail. I remember always wondering what it would be like to be on the AT and looking down at all the interstate traffic. Now I know.I also saw some wildlife today, a garter snake, my first snake of the year. At least it’s a friendly snake. Coincidentally, an hour earlier I met a SoBo couple while we were crossing some formidable rocks, and the lady commented that she was pleased that it was still too cool for snakes. I guess that wasn’t entirely true. At least I didn’t meet a dangerous snake.Tomorrow is forecast to be a rainy day. We’re due, we’ve had terrific weather all week. I’ve been trying to remember if we have any rock scrambles in tomorrow’s section - I don’t think we do, so rain shouldn’t be a big problem, just messy.","Turners Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529328,"It’s interesting how often rain is predicted, but doesn’t really materialize. We expected the trail to be wet when we started today and we were pleasantly surprised to find it dry outside when we woke. And it was in the high 50s as well. Our new temporary abode for 4 nights is the Burgundy Lane B&B in Waynesboro, PA. This B&B is on our short list of favorite places. Margaret and David are very friendly to hikers and very accommodating. They have seven rooms and we found out that each room is decorated differently. Last year we stayed in the Africa Room (pleasant with an outdoor deck where we could dry our shoes each night), but it was taken so we upgraded a bit to the Castle Room. If you appreciate themes, this is damn impressive. The decor includes a suit of armor, an authentic-looking sword mounted on the wall, a mounted crest, a tapestry in the bathroom as well as a clawfoot tub, a gas fireplace in the corner with a helmut and a crown on the mantle, a transom decorated with a castle scene, walls papered with castle stone and painted ivy, and more. The most impressive feature is a massive, fourposter king bed that dominates the space. It’s really kind of fun and you can let your fantasies roam. So, . . . they will prepare nutritious breakfast whenever you wish (6:00 am for us), and its elegantly served. And David will shuttle hikers to the nearest trailheads - for no added fee, and he’s reasonable for longer rides. They do your laundry (included), we have a fridge, microwave, TV and WiFI - what more could a hiker ask? And it’s downtown with restaurants, etc., all nearby. We like it. (I’ve included a pic here in the TJ Photo gallery.Back to the trail talk. Today was a pretty nice trail for the most part. As I mentioned yesterday, we give really high marks to the Maryland Trail Clubs for their impressive work on the local AT. The blazes keep you on trail, the bushes are cut back (tick season is about here), the shelters look decent (but we have no direct experience here), and the campsites seem good. Today we had some easy flat sections, but we also had some challenging ups and downs. One section that we encountered was particularly challenging. It was a downhill section for us (NoBo) through a rock/boulder jumble. I think it was just past the High Rock Loop trail. We had a hard time following the blazes and they were interspersed with a number of pink flags, suggesting that there is considerable trail work in this area. We saw a number of hikers stopped to rest in this area, some were NoBo and some SoBo. It was definitely the slowest part of our hike today. Late in the hike we passed the Pen Mar Park area. Several of the facilities seems to be refreshed or even renovated from last year, but the park was generally deserted today. We moved on quickly and just after crossing a railroad track we came upon the sign for the Mason-Dixon line, the Maryland/Pennsylvania state line. Several hikers that we have seen before were right behind us, so we stopped to take pictures for them with the sign. I wish I had taken a shot of my own, but I used their cameras. I’m sure we’ll see them again in the next several days. We had one steep downhill to Falls Creek, then a longer uphill (I was getting tired) and finally a downhill to PA 16 and our car. (We followed David out to the parking area at PA 16 this AM and then he took us to Wolfsville Road where we started our hike today. So we had an opportunity to hike together today and again tomorrow.) We made it back into Waynesboro by noon and we’ve been enjoying ourselves since. We plan to watch the Caps tonight and we expect to see them win and advance to the next round of the Stanley Cup.I’ve added a pic of my nephew, Jared, to the Photo Gallery, from this past Monday (18th) in DC.","Wolfsville Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529448,"Today was our second day of hiking together (Princess & I both hiking in the same direction at the same time - no key swap). Margaret & David are real troupers, virtually the only B&B that’s willing to have breakfast ready for us at 6:00 AM. Afterward, we followed David in our car out to the AT trailhead on PA 16 where we parked our car, and then we joined him and he drove us around to another trailhead almost 11 miles north on the AT and we hiked SoBo back to our car. We saw quite a few people on the trail today. Most were day-hikers or weekenders, and the rest were flip-floppers who started this week at Harpers Ferry. It rained all night and the trail was wet to start, but it drained well with very little mud. We came prepared with our rain-gear and we never used it. Except for a few sprinkles at the start, it was just damp and humid most of the way and near the end the sun broke out and it started to warm up.Except for a longer, steep slope up to Chimney Rocks, the rest of the trail was unremarkable. This section is well-maintained and there are several flat ridge walks, so we made pretty good time. However, the PA rocks are starting to show up, so beware feet!After we finished the hike, we decided to scope out the trailheads for tomorrow. We have a couple of gravel roads to traverse, but they’re in good condition and don’t present a problem. One positive aspect of this end of the state is that there are quite a few road crossings where the AT is accessible by car and most of them have parking areas. We’re actually starting to think about a more rugged vehicle than our Prius. It hasn’t been a problem yet, but we did like the Ram truck that Spartacus brought along several times last year, and our current host, David has the same thing. Good mileage with 4WD, higher clearance and tougher suspension. Maybe something to think about. We may try a triple key-swap tomorrow, which confuses me just thinking about it, so I won’t try to describe it. We did see our first red-spotted newt today (first for us on this hike). They’re interesting little creatures. They’re a little sluggish, so you’d think they would get gobbled up by other predators in the woods. But they seem to be prolific in certain damp spots. I’ve learned that they have 3 stages, the first and the third are aquatic and the second is the newt stage that we see crawling across the trail. Last year we saw them from southern VA all the way into New England. Often when we spot one, we’ll see one or two dozen in the next couple hundred yards. And yesterday, I forgot to mention that I saw a mouse on the trail. I don’t know what it’s problem was, but it was running in circles, essentially chasing it’s tail, totally impervious to our presence. It really seemed unnatural to me, so I walked around it and went on.","PA 16

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529613,"After a couple of days of hiking together, thanks to a shuttle ride provided by David (Burgundy Lane B&B), today we went back to a key swap strategy. And we decided to break the whole section into 3 pieces and do a key swap in each. This way we see each other a little more often, and we get a little break for water and a snack while we’re driving between sections. We got up really early again and had breakfast, and then drove ourselves to the northern end of the section - also the longest distance from the B&B. We wore cold weather gear to start, it was in the 30’s. We did the northernmost subsection first, then the middle and finished with the southern subsection. The breaks between subsections gave us a chance to adjust our gear to warmer temps and it was well above 60 and near 70 when we finished. We used several gravel roads today and one positive feature of this section (much of which is in the Michaux Forest) is that these roads are in very good shape. They provide a lot of access points to the AT which is helpful for the key swapping strategy that we’re using.   Caledonia State Park was near the midpoint of our hike today. We both think that there has been some adjustment in the path the trail takes through the park, although we’re not certain where the changes were made. The park was busy today with picnics and the trail was active with day and weekend hikers, it was a gorgeous day - not too hot and not too cold. This section is well-maintained, perhaps partly because of the high volume of local hikers with Caledonia Park right on the trail. We passed a very picturesque cabin (Milesburn Cabin) north of the park that is owned by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. The PATC is the local club responsible for maintaining this section (part of a much larger section they manage extending back into Virginia and the Bears Den Hostel, I believe). Princess said that there were people in the cabin and bicycles on the front porch when she passed it, but it was unoccupied a little later when I took a couple of photos. And we also passed one of our favorite shelters, the Quarry Gap Shelter. We haven’t stayed there, but it’s really attractive, almost like someone’s backyard. I learned that initially it was two independent shelters with a capacity of 4 hikers each. Later a green metal roof was added to cover both of the shelters as well as the space between and some additional space in front. A stream that runs in front of the shelter has been lined with stone masonry, there is a sundial, hanging planters and even a metal sheet placed over a covered picnic table to avoid burn marks from hiker stoves. It’s a beautiful shelter in a beautiful setting. Probably the only disconcerting factor is that I saw several signs on the trail in this area that discourage hikers from killing timber rattlesnakes. I haven’t ever seen any here, but the thought that they might be here is a little eerie. The most challenging piece of the trail was south of Caledonia, between US 30 and PA 223. It was a rock-crested ridge line that ran parallel to the AT for some distance. Several times the AT turned and climbed up to the rocks at the top of the ridge and provided some rock hopping and scrambling experience before dropping back down below the crest. Princess did the subsection NoBo and commented that she thought it was well blazed and easy to follow. My SoBo experience was a little different, I had a harder time staying on the trail, and I noticed that there were some “rogue” blazes at one point on the rocky crest. I have no idea how they came to be there, they are white but they didn’t conform to the standard 2” x 6” AT standard and in some cases the paint has run. Regardless, the rocks are good practice for what we’ll get later in eastern PA. I’ve included a couple of photos, but after a while all the rock pics start to look the same.Tonight will be our last night at the Burgundy Lane, tomorrow we’ll check out when we leave for the trail. We have enjoyed Waynesboro again this year and we highly recommend the Burgundy Lane B&B to any hikers who desire to get off the trail for a night or two. They provide free shuttle service to nearby trailheads.","PA 233
",Shippensburg Road,"Apr 24, Sun",15.90
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529855,"Another key swap day for us. Today was less complicated than yesterday since we only had 2 subsections. We checked out of the Burgundy Lane B&B after breakfast and headed for Shippensburg Road where we stopped yesterday, and I dropped Princess off there to start hiking NoBo. Then I took the car on to Pine Grove State Park where I parked the car and headed SoBo. Neither of us remembered much about this subsection of the hike, most of the trees are still bare here and the vegetation on the ridge is mostly laurel and scrub pine. There were several substantially long road walks, so we kept a pretty good pace. I am starting to recognize some of the hikers I’m meeting when I’m going SoBo. Many of them are flip floppers who started last week heading NoBo from Harpers Ferry. And they’re a little confused about us since sometimes they see one of us alone going SoBo and sometimes they see us together, sometimes we’re headed NoBo and we don’t look like typical thru-hikers since we have light-weight packs. So we take a few minutes and explain ourselves, and most of them say “what a great idea, I’d like to do that!” Today I met Lost & Found, Keebler, Swiss Miss, Coolacs, Romani and Sniffles. And I saw Tailhook in both of the subsections that I did. Plus I encountered a large group of at least 2 dozen folks who were our for a few hours excursion and having a great time. A major landmark today was the actual 2016 mid-point of the AT. This year it’s at mile marker 1094.5. Each year the actual mileage of the AT changes a bit as the trail clubs introduce some rerouting of the trail. Over the last 3 years, the cumulative changes have increased the length of the trail each year by a few miles. So the actual mid-point changes a bit also and they move the marker accordingly. I’ve included an ego-selfie at the mid-point, since Princess wasn’t with me when I went past it.Another memorable landmark is Pine Grove State Park, a beautiful park facility that includes Fuller Lake. Also, the Appalachian Trail Museum and the Ironmasters Inn are co-located at the park. In previous years we’ve stayed at the Ironmasters, but this year we decided to move our base to Boiling Springs where we’ll stay 2 days. The Ironmasters is a very nice place to stay and the AT Museum is especially fun for AT hikers, but I had to pass it by so that Princess didn’t have to wait a long time at my pickup point.   We’re staying at Gelinas B&B in Boiling Springs for two nights as we walk into and through town and then on toward Duncannon. We had a good Italian dinner at Aniles this evening, but town is pretty quiet on Monday and several other restaurants & pubs were closed. Maybe things will liven up a bit tomorrow?","Shippensburg Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530040,"The mid-day temp made it to 85 today, fortunately a good breeze picked up and scattered clouds rolled in mid-afternoon. We broke our 14.9 mi hike into 3 subsections, and it was a tale of two trails. The two subsections south of Boiling Springs had a few short, but tough climbs - steep and rocky. The first subsection from Hunters Run to Whiskey Spring had a short climb (300 or 400 ft) to 2 rock mazes that were fun. This is the third time that I’ve hiked through them, I remember the first time they seemed daunting and took time, but today (NoBo) I was able to move through them pretty briskly and there were no surprises. The second subsection (from Boiling Springs SoBo to Whiskey Spring) starts off through open farm fields, then I had a 1 1/2 mile climb (only 500 ft) to Center Point Knob. This was the midpoint of the original AT and a plaque marks the spot. The south side of the knob was much steeper than the north and I slowed down considerably. There were still two more climbs before I reached Whiskey Road where Princess was waiting. Interesting that the elevation changes in these climbs are considerably less than down south, but I guess the heat made them tougher for me. In contrast, our last subsection north of Boiling Springs was a cake walk, very flat with just a few undulations and I went NoBo. The AT passes through a narrow strip of woodland between cultivated fields. At times, the woods become dense with bushes and low growth, and at other times the trail pops out of the woods into the open and follows the edge of a field. It was still hot for me, but the breeze was picking up and as I approached Trindle Rd, the trail passed across a knoll with a stiff breeze and it felt refreshing. Nonetheless, I was happy to see Princess turning into the Trindle Road AT parking area just ahead of me. I should mention that most (but not quite all) of the road crossings north of Boiling Springs had associated parking areas and both of us saw a number of local hikers out for a few hours exercise on the trail.I saw both Tailhook and Duct Tape (he hopes to get a new pair of shoes in Boiling Springs), and our conversations are brief, but enjoyable. Unfortunately they’re finishing up their 200-mile section in Port Clinton so we won’t see them beyond that point. I also met Wazo officially, I’ve seen him a couple of times on the trail. Princess has talked with him more than I and learned that he’s from Arizona, started at Springer and made it to Waynesboro, but went home for several weeks and then started back again at Harpers Ferry to do a flip flop. He has an excellent description of his experiences on his Trail Journals page. Also Princess talked with a couple we’ve seen several times too: Has Been and Toe Sack. We finished hiking around 1:00, so we had time to clean up and find a place for lunch. Cafe 101 was open today, and the outdoor seating looked inviting. Their lunch sandwiches were really good as well as their coffee. Afterward, we headed back to the room to take care of chores and get ready to leave early tomorrow morning (and I got a head start on the blog). Then later we headed over to the Hot Springs Tavern, about the only restaurant in town that we haven’t already tried (although we did get lunch there last year). And we had a great experience. Michael, the bartender was very welcoming and poured me a couple of good IPAs. After about a half-hour, we were pleasantly surprised when Tailhook and Duct Tape rolled in. We had a chance to learn a bit more about them and we wish they weren’t leaving the trail in a few days. I hope to see them again and perhaps hook up again off-trail at some point. Later in the evening, we met several local residents and had a great time. We met a local couple who have been hiking the trail in sections for years and who serve regularly as docents at the AT Museum in Pine Grove Furnace and also lead hiking excursions on the AT in several states. It turned out to be one of those really fun evenings. In general, I’ve been a little disappointed with Boiling Springs. The previous 2 years we’ve stayed at the Allenberry, a resort-like facility with a theater about a half-mile outside town. But the town is very picturesque and we thought we should try out a B&B in town. So we are staying at Gelinas, directly across from the lagoon at the center of town (there are ducks, geese and a pair of swans in the water). I have worked hard back in Norfolk to promote a “Complete Streets” agenda where we try to make public streets more pedestrian, bicycle and public transit friendly. Boiling Springs is the most anti-Complete Streets town that I’ve ever seen. So far I’ve seen only one crosswalk in the town. But I have seen one “duck crossing” yield sign near the lagoon. Clearly the ducks are prized more highly than pedestrians. Crossing streets is dangerous for pedestrians and the sidewalks are uneven and equally dangerous. After talking with Tailhook and Duct Tape at the tavern tonight, it seems that the Allenberry is struggling. The restaurant was closed today, thus the hikers had to walk the half-mile into town in search of dinner. The AT goes directly through town, and the ATC has it’s Mid-Atlantic Office here in town, so I guess it’s destined to be a trail town. But I think the good citizens of Boiling Springs need to pay more heed to what it means to be an AT Trail Town.","Hunters Run Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530193,"For me this is a tough time of the year to write journal entries. The Stanley Cup hockey finals are moving into the second round and I can’t watch a game and write at the same time. So this will be fairly brief. We had an easy hike today. Virtually all of the hike was through rolling farmland, and the only climb was up to the Darlington Shelter. It was a pretty hike as a change of pace from the woods and I actually saw more wildlife (deer, rabbits, geese). We broke the total distance in half and did two key swaps. Most of the roads that crossed the AT had parking areas, so we had a lot of options. The midway point that we selected was at Scott Farm, adjacent to Conodoguinet Creek. The ATC manages the facility as a Crew HQ and provides some hiker facilities - parking, water, privy. The weather today was a lot different from yesterday. Instead of mid-80’s, we woke up to 40’s and it barely made it into the 50’s, and it was overcast all day.
There weren’t many noteworthy sights today. I included a shot that I told from a stile of a curious cow in the middle of the trail, and another of the countryside that is typical of much of our hike today. In one section we passed through a grove of bushes that were incredibly fragrant and I took a photo of the blossoms, but I have no idea what kind of bush it is. The fragrance was intense and almost intoxicating.
After the hike we drove into Harrisburg, we were only about 20 minutes from there and we’re staying at a Comfort Inn close to downtown Harrisburg. We’ve stayed here for 3 years in a row and we’re familiar with the area. We like to visit the restaurant row along 2nd street, and we had a great lunch at McGrath’s Pub. This evening we ate next door at Passage to India. It gets good reviews on Yelp and we had a great dinner. We don’t visit Indian restaurants often and we had to solicit advice on what to order from our friend Alan back in Norfolk. We’re staying here for 2 nights. 
They say that tomorrow it’s going to rain and it feels like it’s ready to start now. We have a short hike into Duncannon, but we remember that it’s very rocky and there’s a long downhill into Duncannon over a lot of slippery loose shale. It won’t be fun if it’s really raining, and it looks like rain is in the forecast for the next week. The long-range forecasts are usually wrong.","Trindle Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530289,"The locals say that they need rain and they’re getting their wish. The rain started just after 11:15 am, almost exactly when predicted earlier in the morning. Fortunately, we were off the trail (a short section) and in our car, driving from Duncannon back to our hotel in Harrisburg. Princess is making frequent adjustments to our plans to accommodate lots of factors, like the weather, access roads, shuttle drivers, etc. Today worked to perfection. We were up early and drove to our shuttle driver’s (Trail Angel Mary) home in Duncannon - by 6:40 AM. After we parked our car, Angel Mary drove us south to where we finished yesterday and we set out NoBo from the PA 850 trailhead at about 7:00. This section of the trail has a lot of rocks and a steep slope at the end into Duncannon, so we wanted to hike it together. This is the third year that Trail Angel Mary has driven us up and down the AT around Duncannon and she’s a trail angel in every sense of the word. When we contacted her this year for arrangements, we were saddened to learn that she is undergoing treatments for cancer. The good news is that the treatments are going well, she says the side effects are minimal, and she looks great and drives just as well as ever. She has nothing but praise for her caregivers and she stopped on the way to deliver some treats to hikers at a nearby hostel. We arranged for her to drive us early in the morning since her treatments are later in the day.Trail-wise, this section of AT seemed easier than either of us remembered. It was overcast and chilly (low 50s) at the start, and that never changed. After crossing a meadow, we climbed to a ridge and the rest of the hike was along the ridge, naturally with plenty of rocks. We were in trees essentially all the way with no views, but the trail was quite dry and it was good practice on the rocks. Eventually we reached the end of the ridge and were treated to views of the valley and Duncannon, with the Susquehanna River winding in the distance. I took a couple of photos from Hawk’s Rock and then we started the rapid descent. Our experience the last 2 years was a tricky downhill over virtually continuous rocks - some of them loose. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the trail maintainers have been busy and have made some dramatic improvements, the slope now has many more rock steps than we remembered. In particular, I remember sliding down a stretch of loose shale. The Mountain Club of Maryland is responsible for maintaining this section of trail. I checked their website, but I couldn’t find any info on work they’ve done in the past year or two. So I don’t know who was responsible, but the trail is in much, much better shape than I remember. I do remember coming down on a warm summer day and the trail was very busy with many local day hikers just hiking up to Hawk’s Rock and back down. Now that’s a much more pleasant hike. Many thanks to whomever did the heavy labor to move all those rocks into place. Once in Duncannon, we recovered our car and headed for Harrisburg and the rains started. Currently it’s 6:30 and it’s been raining ever since, and it’s predicted to continue through tomorrow. So I’m sure we have a wet hike in store for us. Our plans are to have Trail Angel Mary shuttle us north to a trailhead and then hike about 17 miles back into Duncannon. It will be similar to today, climb to the ridge, hike along the ridge for a long time, then a rapid descent down to the Susquehanna River. Thinks to Margaret for the good words on Passage to India, we agree. We went back for lunch today since it was raining and the restaurant is close. Tonight we’ll probably go to the Cuban restaurant that’s only about a block away.","PA 850

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530574,"We’re moving right along. We decamped from Harrisburg early this morning and drove up to Duncannon to hook up with Trail Angel Mary who shuttled us again today. She followed us to the parking lot at the end of the Susquehanna bridge and then she drove us up to the AT trailhead at PA 325. We each took photos, it turns out to be exactly the same spot where we took photos last year. We exchanged hugs and wished her the best with her medical challenges. Given our propensity to hike this trail, there is a reasonable probability that we will do it again, and we will call on her again if we do. She is a super lady and a true trail angel.We had almost a 16 mile hike SoBo today and the weather was not cooperating very well. It was raining lightly when we started and that continued as we climbed up the Peters Mountain ridge. It’s not a very high ridge, around 1300 ft., but it’s very long and we spent the next 5 hours hiking in a more or less straight line along the ridge. The rain was variable, most of the time it was light or just tree rain. A few times it really rained hard, so we got wet. The temp hovered in the mid-40s with a chilly breeze, so it was not pleasant. And of course, we’re in PA, so there were rocks of all sizes. We finished hours ago and my feet still hurt. Often the trail was just below the crest of the ridge, but periodically it moved yup to the top and gave us a chance to dance through some serious rocks. I’ve only included three photos, one with Mary, one of another hiker and one of the rocks. I know that rock photos are pretty boring and the raindrops on the camera lens blurs, so one is enough. We made pretty good time in the first two-thirds of the hike, until we got closer to Duncannon and we spent most of the time on the rock strewn crest line. Other than the weather, today was fun. We had a chance to hike together and we went SoBo, so we saw more hikers since most are heading northbound. I can’t remember all the trail names, but I met Tow Sack, Has Been, Orange Crush (photo included), Stumbling Joe and Marshall (NTN). Everyone was upbeat about the hike, can’t do much about the weather.We also learned today that Bean Dip and Mama Bean are back on the trail. They started at Harpers Ferry and are moving north. We’re probably about a week ahead of them. Plus we heard from Hudson and Big Lu at Bearded Woods and we hope to be there in the near future. My only real complaint about the trail today is the proliferation of poison ivy. We’re several weeks ahead of when we hiked through this area the last 2 years, and the ivy is just emerging. But it’s clear to see that it’s getting worse. I saw some vines that were nearly 2 in. thick. We’ve talked to maintainers about the ivy and they say there’s nothing they can do since it’s not an invasive species. But Princess and I both had problems with it last year even though we took precautions to avoid it. We wash our boots and poles with Dawn. So, a warning to those who will be hiking through here soon - be very careful and do your best to avoid the plants.","Duncannon, north end of Susquehanna Bridge

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530692,"I failed to mention yesterday that after leaving Duncannon we moved on to Pine Grove and we’re staying at the Hampton Inn for several days while we hike the AT sections in this area. We’ve stayed here before and it’s good for us: clean, laundry, wifi, tub, roomy, quiet, etc. There is a diner across the street which is fine, but there’s also a good Irish pub a couple of miles away. After a couple of days of hiking together, today we were back to key swapping. The section today was 16 miles with no reasonable vehicle access anywhere along the trail. So I dropped Princess off at Swatara Gap (the northern end) and then I drove around to where we finished yesterday and parked the car. Then I started hiking NoBo. I met her a couple of miles before I reached the mid-point of the section since she was hiking while I was still driving.The weather was vastly improved over yesterday, the rains quit last night and the temp was in the mid-40s when we started. The sun almost poked through several times and it managed to warm to the upper 50s later in the afternoon. Unfortunately, the improvement is short-lived. The probability of rain is 100% tomorrow and nearly as high on Monday and Tuesday. So it will be a wet week. As long as the temps don’t drop much below 50, it’s not too bad, just unpleasant. I didn’t see many thru-hikers today since I was going NoBo. I only passed one - Smudgey Cheeks. He said he got his name when he was trying to light a campfire by blowing on it. He appeared to be a strong hiker and kept a pretty good pace considering he had a large backpack. I did pass a large group of boy scouts later in the hike, two dozen or more. A quarter mile later I met their scoutmasters trying to catch up with them. I also encountered a group of adults, perhaps a dozen in the Bausch Gap area. And of course, Princess passed by mid-way through the 6-hour hike. I didn’t see many hikers, but the area was full of hunters. I didn’t count, but there were 50 or more trucks parked along the road between the end points of this section. Almost the entire area is under the jurisdiction of the PA Gaming Commission and today was the first day of turkey season. While I was pulling on my hiking boots in the parking lot, a hunter parked his truck and headed up the trail. Princess saw 2 hunters walking along the AT. She said they looked surprised when she told them they were on the AT. I think their only concern about hikers was that they would scare off the turkeys. I heard plenty of gunfire. The trail is in good shape and well marked. Starting at the south end, I had a long uphill to the high point for the day, around 1600 ft, then a long walk along an old forest roadbed. Eventually the trail descended slowly to Rausch Gap. The hike down to the gap was pleasant and the last part followed Rausch Creek through a very nice area. I’ve included a photo of a sign posted at the gap that tells the story of a village that once stood here. After the gap, there was a climb up to Second Mountain and then a descent to Swatara Gap. Most of the hike was pretty easy, with only a few rocky sections. Perhaps the most interesting part of the hike was at the end where the AT provides a tree trunk across a small stream. The trunk is pretty big, so it’s not a big challenge - but it’s fun and it’s different. Princess had already retrieved our car and driven back to pick me up, and she got a pic of me crossing the log.","PA 325

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530881,"The rain started last evening and continued all night. By daybreak it was 45 deg with a light drizzle and there were lots of puddles. Not a pleasant day for hiking, but we were prepared and had everything in Ziplocs. FYI, my iPhone will respond to touch even when it’s inside 2 Ziploc bags - but not when I’m wearing gloves. That’s helpful when it’s wet and I don’t want to unseal the Ziplocs (except I do have a pair of light glove liners with special fingertip material that enables iPhone touch - don’t wear them often).Today’s section didn’t have any intermediate road crossings, so we did one end-to-end key swap. I dropped Princess off at the north end and she hiked SoBo, then I drove around to the other end and set out NoBo. After a small up and down, I started a fairly sharp climb, so I warmed up quickly. I met 2 hikers as I climbed, and except for Princess they were the only other people I saw on the trail today. The elevation profile in AWOL’s AT Guide showed only little wiggles after my first climb and that was accurate, no more serious climbing.As usual, Princess had a head start so she met me before I reached the midpoint. It was raining a bit and the wind had picked up. She really tried to convince me to turn around and go back with her. She said there was a really nasty section of tough rocks that was wet and mossy and very slippery. She said it was uphill for her, so downhill for me and she was convinced that I would slip and break something. Strangely, I couldn’t remember any nasty rocks on this section, so I overrode her veto and pushed on (much to her irritation). After about a mile or so, I ran into the rocks and finally remembered it. It wasn’t a long section, but it was quite a jumble and it was slippery. I took it very slowly and fortunately it wasn’t too long. Sometimes, when I get into the middle of a rock field I have a hard time finding the next blaze, and when the rock field is extensive there may be several potential paths. That wasn’t the case today, it was well marked. Also, the rocks today were angular and it wasn’t too hard to find places to brace my foot against another rock so that it wouldn’t slip. I’ve included a photo. Some of the PA rock fields have a lot of large rounded boulders and you need to step up on top of them - I just hope it’s a dry day when I get to those. There were a few more annoying rocks in the trail, but eventually it merged into an old roadbed and I was able to keep a really good pace for the remainder. Later, Princess said that she saw a lot of familiar hikers after she passed me. They probably stayed at Rausch Gap last night. Today our ponchos worked well. The rain was light and intermittent, but there was always a mist in the air so there was continuous tree rain. As of now, the forecast shows rain every day for the next week. But the temps don’t go below the high-40s, so it should be manageable. We’re here in Pine Grove through tomorrow, then on to Hamburg.","Swatara Gap, PA 72

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531036,"Some days are better than others. We got off to a pretty good start this morning. It wasn’t raining, but there was a mist in the air and fog as we approached the trailheads. I dropped Princess off at PA 183 so that she could go SoBo and I drove the car back to where we finished yesterday (PA 645) and started NoBo from there. I think I was on or near the crest of the ridge for most of my hike, but it was hard to tell since the visibility was so poor. Several points had signs suggesting views, but no views today. I wasn’t really raining, but we both donned our ponchos to fend off the tree rain and keep us a little warmer. The hike was pretty easy, not much climb or descent but a lot of rocks. There were several rock/boulder fields that slowed us down, but they were navigable even with wet, slippery rocks. The rock fields can look pretty menacing as you approach them, but so far it hasn’t been hard to find foot placements without taking a chance on a rounded or mossy rock. That may change in a few days. I hadn’t seen any other hikers before I met Princess near the midway point. As we were talking, Sixty and Tenderfoot went by moving pretty fast. After that, I passed a group of 3 and then 2 hikers that Princess knows as the “brothers”. I stumbled as I was passing them, which was pretty embarrassing, (one hand down, but not a total crash) and I reshaped one of my aluminum hiking poles. I was able to bend it almost back, so now I have 2 bent poles. IMHO [in my humble opinion], carbon fiber poles aren’t worth it to me. The material is great in tension and compression, but it doesn’t take much lateral force to snap them. After I went through 3 sets of CF poles (Leki & REI), an innkeeper took pity on me and gave me a pair of aluminum ski poles. They’re a little heavier, but when they get bent I just bend them back. They don’t collapse (retract), but my carbon pole locks never worked very well anyway. The pole mfgrs tout their replacement warranties, but actually getting them replaced takes time, I didn’t find many outfitters that would do it, they suggested mailing them back to the mfgr. On the flip side, Princess has been perfectly happy with her Black Diamonds and the locks still work fine. And I have been able to replace worn pole tips with boiling water.So much for gear talk. Our big challenge today came at the end, after the hike. It says in our ISO process manual that we both carry car keys. So we don’t actually have to “swap keys” when we pass (that way it isn’t critical if one of us wanders off trail and we miss each other). Except that today one of us left their key in a jacket rather than putting the key in their pack, and they left the jacket in the car. And that jacket got locked in the car at one end of the trail. And we failed to do a “key check” when we passed each other midway along the trail. So when one of us got to the car at the end of the hike, it was locked and there was no way to get in. The only key that wasn’t in the car was 11.3 miles away with the other hiker at the other end of today’s section. A dilemma.That was the worst part of the day. From then on, things improved. Fortunately, we had cell phone service. We were able to contact a shuttle service in the area, and within 30 minutes the shuttle driver picked up the hiker with the key and drove them back to the hiker with a car, but no key. The problem was solved within a hour and the shuttle fee was very reasonable. I don’t think this will happen again.    That’s enough excitement for one day. Tonight we’re packing up and tomorrow morning we’ll say goodbye to Pine Grove. It warmed up nicely this afternoon and the sun poked out, but it looks like 4 days of rain until Saturday with temps ranging between 50 and 60. Uncomfortable, but tolerable. Too bad we have so many rocks in the next few days","PA 645

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531243,"Damn, the Caps couldn’t pull it out last night. Seems like the same story every year. Oh well, we won’t give away our jerseys yet. As far as the trail goes, today was one of those “put in the miles” days. There were very few noteworthy things along the trail. And it was chilly and raining at the outset. The most memorable event for me was the last mile, coming into Port Clinton. The rain had stopped and there were even some lighter spots in the sky. The trail was mostly dry. After 14 miles of rocks, mud and wet laurel, I could smell the barn. The trail started sloping down, more and more. Eventually, I was creeping along one step down at a time. The trail turned into a series of steep stone steps with a lot of gravel in between. It was not fun and I was really relieved when I finally got to the bottom.The trail head at Port Clinton is interesting. The bottom of the descent ends up in a rail yard. There are 3 or 4 sets of tracks to cross, and they appear to be active. I think it’s primarily a switching yard, and I could hear rail cars moving around. Anyway, I got across as quickly as I could. Princess got the voice output working on my iRunner app today. I hiked by myself today and it helps a lot to know how far I’ve gone. And Princess didn’t lock the keys in the car and she picked me up on time, so life is good. We’re staying in Hamburg and there’s a pub connected to our Microtel. And Tampa Bay is our second favorite hockey team - we got to suck a little beer from the Calder Cup when Tyler Johnson and Alex Killorn helped Norfolk win it several years ago.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531428,"Another 15 miler for us. We’re not doing as many miles/day as last year, but we’re trying to get some in every day. About half of today’s hike was a road walk. I should show a pic of a “road walk”, I’m using the term to describe what appear to be forest service roads (although they may be there for other purposes - like water districts). They are cleared paths (no trees), wide enough to drive through, but only if you have a rugged 4WD. The grades may vary, but generally you don’t have to worry about roots or protruding rocks. We had 5 miles of a road walk through a graded path that was very clear. It’s nice at first and I like the opportunity to look at the surroundings, but after an hour and a half it becomes tiring. But that was only half of the hike. The middle part was 3 miles of pretty rugged rocks including the “Pulpit”. In past years, I’ve seen a lot of local hikers around the Pulpit, but this year I was alone. However, any potential views were totally obscured by mist. Also, another day of starting in rain. We’re stuck in the middle of a stalled system and every day seems like Groundhog Day. The rain slowed for me after an hour or so, but was still intermittent so I wore my poncho the whole way. Besides Princess, I only saw one other hiker, so things were pretty quiet. Except that I heard road noise from a parallel highway for at least 5 miles along the trail. It sort of defeats the image of hiking through the deep woods.After Princess picked me up at Hawk Mtn. Rd., we headed down to Cabella’s in Hamburg, near our motel. I decided to pick up some permethrin-treated pants and shirt. I have a spray bottle of permethrin, but I think the pre-treated clothes are better. The ticks are certainly out. Princess found one on her a couple of days ago after she sat briefly on a log. Also, we’ll be running into fly season soon and we need all the help we can get.Tomorrow we’re going to mess with the schedule. Instead of moving on to the last few sections in PA (the worst), we’re jumping ahead to Delaware Water Gap. We have really enjoyed the jazz sessions at the Deer Head Inn and we’re going to stay there a couple of days. Their jazz club is only open Thurs-Sat, and we were able to get reservations on Thursday and Friday. So we’re skipping ahead to there and we’ll do a short hike into the Water Gap tomorrow, stay at the Deer Head tomorrow and Friday, and then come back to finish PA.","Port Clinton

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531540,"Today we vacated the Microtel at Hamburg, PA and headed east in the car. As I explained yesterday, we’re jumping ahead so that we can stay at the Deers Head Inn in Delaware Water Gap (DWG) when the house jazz club is open. So we slept in several hours late, packed up and drove to the AT trailhead where Princess hopped out and headed NoBo toward DWG. Then I drove on to the Deers Head, parked the car and headed SoBo on the trail (the AT goes right alongside the Deers Head as it passes through DWG). Given the trail access roads, we decided to do a short hike today - only 7 miles, rather than a much longer hike. The hike was great, there were some showers overnight, but the morning was rain free. The 2 1/2-mile section of the AT that drops down from Mt. Minsi to DWG is one of our favorite hikes. It has a lot of variety, great overlooks and some interesting formations. Today was the first time that I’ve done it SoBo, so I climbed from DWG up to Mt. Minsi. I think I like it downhill better than uphill. I saw a few section and day hikers and several thru-hikers doing flip-flops. The flip-floppers I saw today are moving pretty fast, they likely left Harpers Ferry a day or so before us (the Flip-Flop Festival in Harpers Ferry) and now they’re about 4 days ahead of us (since we jumped ahead 4 days).Mt. Minsi is sort of underwhelming. There’s a sign about 2 feet high alongside the trail that announces the summit, and about 30 feet away there’s a met station. The summit is relatively flat and covered with trees, and I didn’t see any indication of views from the trail. From Mt. Minsi, the AT heads southwest along a wide, grassy old roadbed. I assume the road once served a facility on Mt. Minsi. The AT roadwork continues for about 2 miles before it drops off the ridge into the trees, and the last couple of miles to PA 611 are rolling hills through the woods with intermittent rocks. Both Princess & I were able to move through it pretty quickly.After Princess picked me up at the end of our hike, we headed back to DWG. We checked into the Deers Head Inn (we called a week ago and were only able to get a room for Thurs & Fri) and climbed up to our 4th floor room. The Inn is pretty old and parts of it reflect it’s heritage. But the rooms are clean and updated, and have everything that we need. And the halls are filled with photos & posters & memorabilia of jazz artists who have performed here over the years. Tonight we’re headed to the jazz club. It’s touted as the oldest, continuously running jazz club in the US. We stayed here the first 2 times we did the AT, but the first year we didn’t realize the club was only open on weekends. So last year we arranged to be here when the club was open and we really enjoyed it. So we’re headed there in a couple of hours for dinner and really looking forward to it.","Fox Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531756,"Today was a day for the ducks. Wettest day we've had in a long time. I shouldn't dwell on it, nobody's fault, but it was hard to think about anything else. Our ponchos worked fine -- my boots were the issue. They are advertised as waterproof, but after 5 hours of rain, they fill with water and the waterproofing does a better job of keeping the water in than it does at keeping the water out. OK, that's enough about rain. We passed by the Mohican Outdoor Center, Sunfish Pond and a beautiful stream that was flowing full with all the rain and cascading along the trail. There are cairn fields along the trail and I took a photo of one. There were several recent blowdowns along Sunfish Pond that made the trail evenl more challenging. The highlights today were off the trail. Our first stop was the Village Farmer and Bakery in DWG. We love their pot pies for lunch and top it off with strawberry-rhubarb pie and ice cream. The Sycamore Grille is a favorite haunt, but our go-to stop is the Deer Head Inn. We rearranged our hiking schedule to stay at the Inn on a weekend when their jazz club is open. Last night was jam night and we heard a lot of new performers. Tonight we heard a featured group, the Davey Lance trio and we really enjoyed it. The Inn is a fascinating place with lots of history. It's one of the longest, continuously running jazz clubs in the US. Great dinners, my salmon was top notch and the chowder done with ginger was awesome. And the rooms are comfortable, clean and up-to-date. Best of all, the staff remembered our trail names from last year.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532034,"Some of you may know that we jumped ahead by about 4 days to Delaware Water Gap, and we hiked from there for the past two days. The reason is that we like the jazz at the Deer Head Inn and the jazz club is only open Thurs, Fri and Sat. So we drove to DWG and stayed at the Deer Head to enjoy the music on Thurs & Fri. We had a great time at the Inn and hiked the AT sections just south of DWG and just north of DWG. We would have stayed another night, but the Inn was fully booked on Sat. We may come back for one more evening next week to catch the Thurs nite jazz jam.    So today (Sat) we checked out of the Deer Head and drove south to begin hiking the sections of trail that we jumped over. Today we did a key swap between Hawk Mountain Road (where we stopped on Wed) and Blue Mountain Summit. After we finished we checked into a room at the Blue Mountain Summit B&B. This makes the third year that we’ve stayed here. The B&B has three rooms and offers camping and some outdoor facilities for hikers. The restaurant is very good, quite a few hikers stop by for lunch and their dinner menu is excellent. Plus we enjoy Ken, the owner and bartender. Today was a special day for Ken, his son Benjamin graduated from Penn State and he had a celebration at the inn for friends and family. Fortunately for us, the kitchen and bar stayed open. And this time, we got the room with the jacuzzi. Life on the AT is good.Today’s hike was almost 12 miles, and at least a third of it was an easy walk through a woods road. However, that was mixed in with several stretches of really tough rocks - more like boulders. They weren’t desperately difficult, but it was slow going. Princess hiked NoBo today and had the hardest climb, several miles of steady uphill.Tonight we’re having dinner here at the Blue Mountain and plan to watch the Caps play. They’ve reached the desperation point, down 1-3 to the Penguins.","Hawk Mountain Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532074,"Today was the second day of our PA makeup hikes. We’re covering the sections of trail that we skipped over in order to enjoy the Deer Head Inn and jazz last week. We checked out of the Blue Mountain Summit B&B a little later that we planned this morning. When the alarm went off at 5:30 am, we could hear the rain pelting on the roof. The forecast said that the chance of rain should essentially vanish by around 8, so we went back to sleep. And when we woke again around 7, the rain was over. We divided today’s hike into 3 key swaps. I’ve explained the process before, so I won’t bore you with details (except that we used Bake Oven Knob Road and Ashfield Road to access the AT at intermediate points). We had 3 tough sections today: Knife Edge, Bear Rocks and Bake Oven Knob. Knife Edge is a little intimidating. I’ve done it twice before, but this was the first time by myself. It’s a narrow crest of angled slabs of rock with steep drops on both sides. It’s not very wide and the slabs are not continuous, so I had to pick a path along the crest and switch from one side to the other. I’ve included a photo of the crest, and the views of the valley were dramatic. There was a strong crosswind and that was a little disconcerting when I had to move from one slab to another. Also, the descent from the crest at the north end was challenging, but I remembered the direction the trail took so I didn’t have to search for blazes. Shortly after descending the knife edge, the trail leads into Bear Rocks. I’m not sure exactly where this feature starts since the trail is loaded with so many rocks - however, there is a point where the rocks are much bigger and more difficult to maneuver through. Fortunately, the rocks had mostly dried by the time I arrived so I was able to hop across the larger rocks and move through them more quickly.Bake Oven Knob was as difficult for me as Knife Edge, mostly because it seemed more difficult to find the blazes. It’s mostly a boulder scramble across a knob, so there isn’t a specific path through the boulders. A group of 4 hikers were 30 or 40 yards behind me and they became skeptical that I was still on trail. They had started to head in a different direction when I spotted a clear blaze in front of me and I think they got back on course. I think my pace across the knob was about the slowest I’ve done so far this year. The descent into Lehigh Gap wasn’t as steep as other gaps in the area, a longer gradual descent with a shelter in the middle. When we both finished, we headed for the Filbert B&B in Danielsville. The Filbert is another of favorite spots and this is our third visit. Kathy runs the Filbert with help from Sherry and we really like the place. Kathy is willing to make breakfast for us as early as we want and she shuttles to and from the trail. Tomorrow we’ve asked her to lead us in her car to our end point, where we’ll park our car, and then she’ll drive us to our starting point. That way we can hike together and we don’t have to worry about getting to the end point at a specific pre-determined time to meet her. We just hike to our car and then drive back to the B&B. Tonight we had a good dinner at the Covered Bridge Inn and now we’re ready to go tomorrow. The first thing we’ll tackle is the steep climb out of Lehigh Gap to the Superfund Site. So I’m off to get some rest.","Blue Mountain Summit, PA 309

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532242,"We got a great weather day and we needed it for the rock climb up to the Superfund Site above Lehigh Gap. Kathy at the Filbert B&B started us off right with a full breakfast feast including ham and a cheese omelet and lots of associated goodies. After plenty of coffee, we followed Kathy in our car up to the Smith Gap AT crossing (our finishing point today) and parked our car there. Then she drove us back to our starting point at Lehigh Gap. The first item on our to-do list was to climb the roughly 950 ft of rocks above the gap. Actually the first part of the climb is a long series of rock steps. It took us about 45 min to cover the first mile up [to just beyond] the south end of the Palmerton Superfund Site. Mostly I try to look up rather than down, but I did stop to take a few more photos this time. Princess led the way and I think we did it faster this year than we have in the past. And it seemed to both of us that there are twice as many blazes marking the way up than in the past 2 years. This is definitely a memorable climb.I talked about the superfund site last year. A large area at the summit was contaminated as a result of zinc smelting and is now off limits. The AT skirts around the site for almost 3 miles. Two years ago this section of trail was a narrow path through tall grass that was loaded with ticks. Since then the path has been improved and the grass has been cut back most of the way. Near the end of the detour, the trail passes through a rocky section and then a wooded section before emerging at a power line that marks the north end of the site. There are a lot of boulders below the power lines and the AT zigzags across them. There are several turns in the boulders and fortunately the blazes have been improved, but hikers still need to beware to exit the boulder field at the point marked with blazes. There are still a lot of rocks as the trail winds around for a mile or so until it crosses Little Gap Road. Overall, we think the superfund site looks significantly better than it did 2 years ago. The growth along the trail is much higher and the area looks greener to us than before.Little Gap shows a small dip in the AWOL elevation curve, but that translates into a tough little climb through a boulder field. If the hiker looks closely, there is an almost continuous set of rock steps most of the way. Occasionally you need to improvise, but it’s not as hard as it first appears - just long and tiring. The rest of the trail to Smith Gap is a relatively easy walk in the woods, with the customary PA rocks sprinkled throughout.After the hike we drove in to Palmerton to find a lunch spot and ended up at Balch’s Soup Salad and More. It was a good spot for lunch and I topped it off with a sundae at Claude’s Creamery on the main drag in Palmerton. Later when we went out hunting for dinner, we learned that Monday night is the night off for almost all the restaurants in the area. We did manage to find an Italian restaurant in Walnutport that was OK. Also, FYI, many restaurants in PA don’t have licenses to sell alcohol, but in some cases they have no objection if you bring your own. I suggest that you call ahead to check on a restaurant’s policy if you want to do this.","Superfund trailhead, Lehigh River North

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532431,"Part of our philosophy this year is to slow down a bit and not push too hard. Last year we were moving more like 15 to 20+ miles a day. We took zeros, but we were having more physical issues. Now, we’re doing shorter distances which in turn gives us more rest time each day. And since we plan to hike the Virginia AT after we do the JMT in CA, we’ve actually extended our AT hike into October/November, so we have more time end-to-end. Last year we would have combined today and tomorrow into one 16.6 mile day, instead of breaking it into 2 days (like we’re doing this year). But we also have an ulterior motive, we plan to check back into the Deer Head Inn in Delaware Water Gap and stay over on Thursday to hear the Jazz Jam night. And we’re hoping that Kathy and Sherry from the Filbert B&B will join us there.So, about today’s hike. It was fine, but nondescript. There were really no unusual features, only a power line and several views of the adjacent valleys. There were a few short sections without rocks, but mostly it was rocks all the way. Not the boulders, just the numerous, onerous, small, pointy ones that you can’t avoid - like walking on a bed of really big nails. We did a single key swap and I started SoBo with the climb up from Wind Gap. It was really easy compared to yesterday’s climb up from Lehigh Gap. It was overcast today and much cooler than yesterday, although still quite comfortable for hiking (actually almost perfect). Without the sun, we didn’t get many flies, and the trail was dry. It did start to sprinkle just a little for the last 2 miles of my hike and just began to turn into a rain when I reached Smith Gap where Princess was waiting. I never needed my poncho.I met only 2 hikers on the trail today, Crash and Holcomb. Holcomb is also on this blog site (TrailJournals), so I read a little about him. He started the AT last year, but had some tough luck and bad weather. He’s back at it again this year and seems to be doing much better, putting in some major miles too!! It appears that he will be in Delaware Water Gap when we are back there, so I may see him again.The highlight of the day was lunch at Joey B’s in Palmerton. It got really good ratings on Yelp, so we decided to try it out. Possibly one of the best beer menus that I’ve seen, a huge selection of IPAs. And our meals were terrific. I had the “flight of soups” (taco soup, lobster bisque, kale & watercress, shrimp chowder, I think), and Princess had the Rachel. We highly recommend it. And tonight we had a really good Italian dinner at A Ca Mia's in Walnutport.","Smith Gap Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532769,"OK, I’m a little toasted tonight. I should have written this earlier, but now we’re have a fun time at the Sycamore Grille in Delaware Water Gap and I need to get to bed soon. Today’s hike was pretty easy, just 8.5 miles and only two notable sections. The first was a climb up from Wind Gap that took a while, but I remembered doing this 2 years ago with Princess & Pintsize. Boss dropped Pint off at the Wind Gap parking lot just as we were starting and we headed up the hill with Pint. The thing that I remember is that I needed a bio-break about halfway up the climb and there just wasn’t any reasonable place along the narrow trail.Enough of that, the other memorable place was Wolf Rocks. Wolf Rocks is a narrow crest of rocks along a ridge that suddenly pops up in the forest. after a few boulders, the trail heads up over some large rocks with a long drop on one side and not too much maneuvering space on the other side. The best path is to rock hop along the crest. Since I’ve done it twice before and today was dry, it wasn’t a big deal to me. But it still slows you down. We did a key swap today after we checked out of the Filbert B&B in Danielsville and we had to say goodbye to Kathy & Sherry. It’s always tough to leave since we have such a good time. We may see them at the Delaware Water Gap, they may join us for the jazz jam on Thursday - we hope so. So next, I drove Princess to Fox Gap and she hiked SoBo today. Then I drove back to Wind Gap and hiked NoBo. In a couple hours, I met Princess and then saw several SoBo hikers. I also surprised a bear along the way. Kind of a medium-sized critter, I think I surprised it about 20 or 30 yards ahead of me. I fumbled for my camera, but it took off running down the trail and I never had a chance for a photo. It continued to run until I couldn’t see it anymore. Beautiful glossy black fur. The only bad news was that it headed in the same direction that I was going. So I turned on my iTunes music loud and hiked on. Fortunately, I didn’t see it anymore.Not long after that, Marshall caught up with me while I was talking with a couple of SoBo hikers. And we hiked the rest of the section together. We had a good conversation and a pleasant hike. We did Wolf Rocks together and it was the easiest time I’ve ever had going through those rocks. Several miles later we popped out onto the parking area at Fox Gap where Princess was waiting and I climbed into the car, while Marshall continued on to Delaware Water Gap.Princess and I had lunch at the Apple Pie Bakery (aka the Farmer’s Bakery) and moved back into the Deer Head Inn. We took a nap and then later headed down the street to the Sycamore Grille for dinner. We saw Marshall, Snipe and Holcomb there and had a great time, eventually closing the bar (they close early here in DWG). So now we’re back in the room, we’ve had a great night out with friends, and it’s time to get ready for tomorrow’s hike. Goodnight Mrs. Calabash, where ever you are.","Wind Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532919,"We got a shuttle today so we were able to hike together. We followed Kenny to Millbrook-Blairstown Rd. and then he drove us to Cluver Gap and we hiked SoBo from there. Its interesting how we have done these sections before and we don’t remember most of the terrain. I remember bits ad pieces, but not most of the trail. For example, much of the hike today was a “road walk” (not really a road, but what’s left of a previous forest road). There was one unique feature when we encountered a “cliff” that we had to descend, but it wasn’t a big issue. Much of it was ridge-walking across smooth slanted rocks and we were appreciative that it was dry today. We also went past a beaver pond, where we could see the beaver hut and the results of beaver activity, but the pond looked pretty stagnant and I’m not sure the beavers are still active here. We did see a snake swimming across the pond and I thing it was a water snake, nothing sinister.Today was a relatively short hike (14.5 mi) and didn’t take long, we were finished shortly after lunch. We headed straight back into Delaware Water Gap and ate at the Farmers Bakery. We split a bacon-lettuce-avocado-tomato sandwich and I finished it off with some chocolate-mint ice cream. This is a great town.We prepped for tomorrow and then took a nap. For the evening, we headed downstairs to the Thursday night Jazz Jam Session and we were not disappointed. My dinner was an almond-crusted salmon and the soup special and I loved it. As a special treat, Kathy ad Sherry from the Filbert B&B in Danielsville joined us and we had a terrific time. We exchanged all sorts of trail stories and learned a lot about local lore and all of a sudden the evening was late. One of the best attributes of the trail is meeting people that you really like and enjoy, and spending time with them. It draws you into coming back.We did meet lots of hikers on the trail today since we were headed SoBo, most I can’t remember. But we saw Orange Crush again and talked with her. And we met Chafe. Plus at least a dozen others that I expect we’ll see further along the trail.Now it’s late and I can still hear the jazz drifting up from the club downstairs. I wish I were there, but I know that I have to get up early in the AM and head out for a “double key swap” day tomorrow. So good night to all, life is good on the trail.","Millbrook-Blairsville Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533051,"Another day in paradise - well, actually today was a little less than perfect. We had a constant threat of rain that was predicted for mid-morning and we hoped we could finish before it materialized. Up early as usual and we vacated the Deer Head Inn and were on the road by about 6:00 am. [Challenging considering last night’s revelry with Kathy & Sherry in the Deer Head Jazz Club.] We had a long drive to the point where we finished yesterday, and since we did a “key swap” we had to drive even further to an access point along the trail. For the first time, the approach road didn’t actually go all the way to the trail, so Princess had to hike about a quarter mile from the end of the access road up a side trail to the AT. She hiked SoBo from there and I went back to our starting point for today’s section, parked the car in an AT parking area and headed NoBo. This was a departure for us since I had not set eyes on the point where the access trail joined the AT (where Princess had started hiking SoBo). When I met Princess midway on the section, she had to give me a description of how to recognize the side trail where she got on the AT. There wasn’t a sign for the side trail, but she took iPhone pictures and told me exactly how far it was from the Pavilion (a landmark on the AT). Her description was perfect and I had no trouble finding the side trail, and when I headed down that trail, it took me directly to where Princess was waiting in the car for me. I’m providing the details only because it illustrates one of the potential problems with the “key swap” strategy, namely when one of the end points is an access trail rather than a paved road crossing. This hasn’t happened before, but it may be more frequent as we hike further north and there are fewer roads crossing the actual AT.I should mention a couple of electronic aids we use that help us make this work. (1) We both carry iPhones and since we stay off trail every night, we can keep them charged up. We both have the iRunner app and it has a “outdoor hike” option that gives us the exact distance we’ve traveled as well as our pace. So she was able to tell me exactly how far it was from the Pavilion landmark to the side access trail. This app apparently uses GPS, because it runs with the phone in ‘airplane’ mode. (2) I installed an app on my iPhone called “Guthook’s Hiking Guide” and I bought a full set of maps for the AT. This app will provide me with my exact location on a map of the AT. I can use a finger spread to zoom in on my location and literally tell if I’m on the trail, or 10 or 15 feet off the trail. And if I’m off the trail, I can rotate the phone until it points to where the AT actually is. It also operates in ‘airplane’ mode, and I can turn the GPS locator on or off to conserve even more power. And the Guthook map of the trail includes all the road crossings, trail crossings, water opportunities, shelters, landmarks, etc. along the trail. Essentially most of the same markers as the AWOL AT Guide, plus a few more. And I can tap on a feature that’s ahead of me (or behind me) on the trail and it will tell me the exact distance to that feature from my current position. The app has other features as well (like elevation profile), but if you’re interested you can read about those in the app store. I learned about it last year from WyeKnot, a thru-hiker who was legally blind and had problems staying on the trail. When he got off trail, he used it to find his way back to the AT. (3) Both of us also have an electronic version of the current AWOL AT Guide on our iPhones that’s available from Dave Miller. It has GPS coordinates of (almost) all the parking spots along the AT with hyperlinks so that we can instantly get a Google map of those spots (if we have cell coverage of course). We use it a lot to guide us when we’re driving to the trailheads since we can put the GPS coordinates into our car’s navigation system. (4) And FYI, I also carry the Delorme InReach communication system that uses the Iridium satellite system (doesn’t rely on cell towers, and can get access virtually anywhere). I can send emails from it, but mostly I carry it for emergencies since it has a “911” feature - that I hope never to use. The Machine gave me the details on this in 2014. Sorry about all of that, but I thought it might help some hikers somewhere along the way.So: what happened today? Princess stayed dry, I dropped her off at an intermediate point and she hiked NoBo to the final end point, while I drove around to the end point and hiked SoBo. So she got finished earlier than I did and jumped into the car at the end point and drove back to the intermediate point to pick me up. So I was out there a little longer and started catching some light rain, but never enough to put on my poncho - so it turned out fine. Later, after we were checked into the High Point Mountain Motel, the rain started in earnest and it got wet. But now it’s nearly 9:00 and the rain is over. There is rain scheduled for later tomorrow, so we hope to beat it again.The hike today was not too difficult, although there were a few challenging spots and still quite a few rocks to slow us a bit. We passed the Culver fire tower near the southern end of the section (with a picnic table at the bottom). And there was a climb up Sunrise Mountain that has a magnificent stone pavilion at the summit (very large with benches all around). Now I’ve visited the Pavilion 3 times, the first time it was pouring rain, today it was socked in with clouds (no views), and I can’t remember the other visit so I guess it wasn’t memorable either. But I’m told that the views are spectacular when weather permits. Last year I included a picture of the Pavilion and described it - so you could click on our 2015 AT blog (on the sidebar) and look for June 06, 2015. I’ve heard that there’s a somewhat morbid element of the history too, but I won’t go there.The trail got pretty rocky near the northern end as we closed in on the High Point State Park HQ. There was a steep, but thankfully very short cliff to conquer and a couple of steep and rocky slopes. The Park HQ building is a very large and impressive stone structure. I went in to ask about leaving my car in their parking lot, but I was told no and that I had to use the AT parking lot a 0.2 mile down the road and take a quarter mile blue blaze trail to the AT. So this time the roles were reversed and I had to tell Princess how to spot the side trail to the parking lot when she got to the end of her hike. The good news was that the trail had a name and a sign, so it was easier.This afternoon after our hike, we took advantage of the car and drove to Milford, PA for lunch. We found a very nice restaurant we’d highly recommend - The Waterwheel Cafe, and a deli called Fretta’s Italian Food Specialties that had all sorts of delicious goodies, but no place to sit inside. We managed to buy a lot anyway, so we’re well stocked for dinner tonight and tomorrow, as well as breakfast. I like slack packing with a car.","Culvers Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533202,"We had some good luck again today dodging the rain (and we made it past Friday the 13th without incident). There were still some puddles when we woke up, but by the time we ate and Ron drove us to the trail (about 6:30) the roads were mostly dry. There was fog in lower areas that burned off quickly as the sun climbed higher. The rain prediction shifted overnight to later in the day, so we were quite comfy in the 50’s and 60’s for the hike.We got a shuttle ride today so that we could hike together and we left our car enroute at the AT lot near the High Point State Park HQ, then Ron drove us on to our end-point at the Liberty Corners Road crossing. We hiked SoBo today, but I’ve decided for consistency to list the starting and destination points in this blog as if we always head NoBo. I’ll describe how we actually do it (NoBo, SoBo or sub-section) in the daily description. If I can find time, I’ll go back and update the previous entries. Our hike today started on a very long boardwalk through a wooded area. The boards were still wet and very slick from yesterday’s rain, making it a very slow and treacherous, but we made it through without incident. We emerged from the woods onto the Wallkill Reserve. (I’m not sure if the woods is part of the reserve.) It appears to be a large, rectangular, marshy wildlife reserve and we hiked around part of the perimeter. I think it’s a big attraction for birders and we saw and heard birds that we haven’t seen before as well as deer. The mist had condensed on every spider web, making them dramatically highlighting them and showing hundreds and hundreds in every direction. The trail is actually a roadbed around the marsh and the grass is sill low, so we didn’t get as soaked as we have in past years.   From there, we wound around through a maze of meadows, fields, fence lines, ponds, woods and more marsh for several hours. I think we crossed between two ridges The sun warmed us up nicely and dried out most of the trail. Eventually we reached the ridge where High Point Park is located and started a more aggressive climb with switchbacks and a few boulder sections. The AT passes an observation platform that provides a nearly 360 deg view of the surroundings, including a good look at the High Point tower that is about 0.3 miles on a side trail. The tower marks the highest point in NJ. We’ve never actually taken the side trail to the monument, but I’ve included a photo from the platform. Apparently this is a popular area and there were quite a few park visitors. The AWOL Guide indicates that there are concessions and a beach (?) located close by, although the concessions don’t open until Memorial Day. About a mile later we reached the park HQ and our car. The High Point Country Inn where we’re staying is about 1 1/2 miles from the HQ. The High Point Inn is another of our regular stops and we enjoy coming back to see Ron, who manages the motel and does the shuttling, and his dog Murph. They have been working on upgrading the rooms, repainting, and we see improvements every year. It has the features we look for - clean, refrigerator, microwave, wifi, laundry, shuttle, tub, etc. No walkable restaurants, but several that will deliver. And the landscaping is impressive. After cleaning up, we headed back to the Waterwheel Care in Milford again for lunch. We were earlier today than yesterday and the cafe was packed with patrons. We also picked up some dinners from Fretta’s for later and a few supplies.The forecast suggests a cold front moving through, possibly more rain tonight and temp dipping down to near 40 tonight and into the 30’s tomorrow night. That should be good hiking weather and after tonight, no rain until midweek. More key swapping tomorrow, so we’ll both be hiking solo.","High Point, NJ 23

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533364,"I’m not sure how today’s climb relates to Led Zeppelin, but the toughest climb of the day up the south side of Wawayanda Mtn is known as the “stairway to heaven”. The climb is almost 1,000 ft and much of the upper part is up and across a boulder cascade. The path through the boulders includes numerous rock steps. Today was a key swap day for us and Princess elected to take the climb, leaving me to descend the stairway. Climbing takes more energy, but I find descending to be nerve-wracking and hard on the knees. What goes up must come down, so I guess it evens out in the end. We checked out of High Point Mountain Inn and said goodbye to Ron and Murph. We enjoyed our stay as usual. We did 3 keys swaps today to break up the distance and get a little rest along the way. Today was Sunday, so there were a lot of local hikers on the trail, especially around Pochuck Creek and Wawayanda Mountain. We expected the trail to be busier even with an early start, and we were concerned about being able to get parking at the trailheads. Some of the AT trailheads have large parking areas to accommodate local hikers, but others have only a few spaces and quickly fill up on weekends. We only had a problem at one trailhead, Barrett Road, where the cleared area was already filled. But there was some additional grassy area and I was able to squeeze in - later several more found room as well. Barrett Road was actually double trouble because it’s a very narrow, curvy, steep climb with a lot of high-speed traffic. A sign at the bottom warned that the road was designed in the horse and carriage days, and cautioned drivers to take it slow (posted 25 mph) and enjoy the ride. No one I saw was even close to 25 mph. Anyway, we made it safely and squeezed into the postage stamp parking lot. The lot between Wawayanda and Pochuck Creek, on the other hand, had space for maybe 2 dozen cars or more - and it was busy.Today’s weather was good for hiking, but not much else. It started in the high 30’s and climbed into the lower 50’s with a stiff breeze. We also had some sprinkles of rain through the morning even though it was forecast to be rain-free. There are frost warnings out tonight, although it could climb into the 60’s by tomorrow afternoon. We need some good weather tomorrow since we have a tough hiking day. The elevation profile is pretty flat, but we know from experience that the terrain is not easy. There were several highlights today - the stairway up Wawayanda is certainly noteworthy. I took a number of photos and they look like other rock photos, I guess you just have to be there. The Pochuck Creek area is different. There is an elevated boardwalk that zigzags over the swamp for nearly a mile with built-in benches at intervals. There is a small island of trees partway across, and an impressive suspension bridge over the creek itself. The police were out and set up cones for a roadside parking area to accommodate the weekend visitors who came out to hike across the swamp. It was busy. Otherwise, there was considerable variation in the terrain and a number of hikers I passed commented on how much they enjoyed the trail. After the hike, we headed into Greenwood Lake, NY where we’ll stay at Anton’s on the Lake for several days. We’ve stayed here before, it’s comfortable and convenient with restaurants, groceries, bars, laundry and shuttling. And I had a really good shepherds pie at Murphy’s.","Liberty Corners Road

And it’s a good thing since we had some challenges ahead of us. We remembered parts of this section from previous years, we hiked it SoBo in 2014 and NoBo in 2015. There are a number of memorable features including the NJ-NY border, the highest point on the AT in NY, a rock climb with an anchored ladder, and a series of exposed rock ridge lines including the eastern Pinnacle and Cat Rocks. The mileage isn’t excessive, but the terrain is daunting.But one of the neatest events occurred early in the hike along a relatively flat section of trail. As we passed a small isolated pond, Princess noticed that there were 2 swans in the middle. We stopped for a moment, the swans were somewhat hidden by the brush around the pond, but eventually we saw that there were also 2 cygnets with them. I managed several shots with my zoom and if you look closely, you can just make out the small ones. It was a great moment for us. The trail circled around the end of the pond, but they were only visible from the initial point where we saw them.Not long after that we started a climb towards the ridge line and the hiking got tougher. It was a narrow ridge somewhat like the Knife Edge and Wolf Rocks in PA, but the rocks here are different. In many sections they are smoother and more rounded. We were lucky that they were dry and our boots got good traction on the sloping rocks. I’ve included more pics than usual. The state border line was painted on the rocks, with a survey marker in the middle. There wasn’t any sign at the highest point, Prospect Rock, but we assumed that the American flag that was flying in a stiff breeze identified the landmark. Several times we climbed to the ridge and walked the rocks, then dropped down a bit, and eventually climbed back up for another ridge walk. One of the climbs went up a very steep rocky slope and the trail led us into a sort of chimney opening with very steep walls. and blazes painted at the top. I remembered it from previous years when there was an aluminum ladder bolted to one wall as a climbing aid. This year the ladder was replaced with a series of rebar steps that led up a wall. From there the hiker can scale the rest of the way up to the ridge line.The ridges included features called the Eastern Pinnacles and Cat Rocks. Princess loves climbing these rocks and insists on taking the lead. That gives me a chance to take some photos and an excuse for lagging behind. In truth, she moves through the big rocks a lot faster than I and actually enjoys them. Cat Rocks is the hardest for me. It’s difficult to get up to the top, but it’s not very long. The last couple of huge rock formations are big and nearly flat on top with steep drops on all sides. For me, the most difficult part is getting down the NoBo end of the last rock. Others may find a different path down, but we inch down several small ledges and hang on to some crevices and edges with our fingers. The climbs look wicked when I look up, but I think the descents look worse from above.Cat Rocks was a mile or two from the end of our section, and when we finished we texted our shuttle driver, Matt Anton. We drove ourselves out to our starting point this morning and left our car there, and Matt picked us up at the end and drove us back to our car. We knew this section has some challenges, so we wanted to hike it together. Tomorrow we will probably go back to a key swap approach. The worst part of my day was this evening, when I spilled just a little bit of IPA on my computer keyboard. I mopped it up quickly, but 5 or 10 minutes later, it started acting up and reached a point where I really can’t use it - although it looks normal. So I’m back to my iPhone. I tried it again a few hours later and it was a little better, but still not back to normal. Fingers crossed.","Warwick Turnpike

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533707,"This entry will be short. I have a lot to say, but it’s late and my computer is still giving me problems. I can read and manipulate files, but several of my keyboard keys don’t work. Too bad, since today was a really interesting day: a lot of difficult ups and downs. None of them are noteworthy in terms of elevation, they hardly show up on the profile. But they are steep and involve a lot of boulder jumbles. We did a key swap today, and the hardest climb for me was near the start of the hike. I took some pics, but there is no way to capture how steep these inclines really are. Much of the time my hiking poles were useless and got in the way. In addition to the difficulty, these climbs are tiring and the cumulative effect makes it harder and harder to keep moving forward and up. I passed Holcomb and Crash just as they were turning into a shelter and I’m curious what Holcomb has to say about the day’s work.Several of today’s features have names, notably The Lemon Squeezer, Arden Mountain and Fingerboard Mountain. I’ve talked about the Squeezer the last 2 years and not much has changed, it’s still a narrow passage. Arden Mountain is a long hike up a stiff incline that doesn’t seem to end, but there’s not much to see when it finally does. I assume that Fingerboard Mountain gets it’s name from the distinctive rocks at the top. They’re long and sometimes narrow, and usually relatively flat. One section that doesn’t get much press is the precipitous descent from Buchanan Mountain down to East Mombasha Road. The first time I encountered this I wasn’t sure I would make it down safely. Now, I know that it’s doable, but it’s still gives me pause. After the hike, we had a busy afternoon. We’re planning a key swap tomorrow, so we drove ahead to make sure we know where the parking areas are located. Then we did some laundry, got some groceries, stopped by CVS, had dinner at Murphy’s, and then started prepping for the next hike. I think I forgot to mention that Princess saw a bear yesterday. She was forewarned by 2 passing hikers that they had just seen a bear, and sure enough she also saw it not long after. She said it was off to the side of the trail and disappeared quickly. Today was less exciting, just the usual dozens of chipmunks. I’m headed for sleep now, just as soon as I get this posted.","Lakes Road
",Arden Valley Road,"May 17, Tue",13.90
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533811,"We planned a key swap today and we decided to split it into 2 sections. Our start point was the trail crossing at Arden Valley Road where we finished hiking yesterday. There’s not much space here for parking, so we planned to leave the car at an intermediate point, the parking area near the trail crossing at Seven Lakes Drive (Seven Lakes Dr crosses the AT twice and we used the Seven Lakes Dr parking area near the AT mile 1398.0). The AWOL AT Guide doesn’t identify a parking area at that road crossing, but we had a map that did and when we checked it out we found off-road space for maybe a half dozen cars. The parking area is identified as 1777 Trail Parking and that trail passes through the parking area, then joins the AT in about 0.1 mile. The spur trail is marked as the 1777 Trail, not a blue blaze.Everything went peachy, I dropped Princess at the Arden Valley Road and she started NoBo from there. I drove on to the Seven Lakes Drive parking area and headed up the 1777 trail. I took a photo of the point where the spur trail joined the AT for Princess since she hadn’t actually walked up the trail. Then I started down the trail going SoBo. All was fine for a few hundred yards, then the AT split from the 1777 trail and I didn’t realize it. The AT blazes are white and the 1777 blazes are white with an “F” in the blaze. It was rocky and I was watching where I stepped, and I didn’t realize my mistake until I had gone about a half mile (pretty far). So I stopped and hauled out Guthook’s Hiking Guide and sure enough I was nowhere near the AT. So I backtracked and found my mistake, but it cost me a mile of extra hiking and I was badly behind schedule. We know each other’s hiking pace and we can figure out about where we should meet when we’re doing the swap. Princess was worried when I was late. Eventually we met and decided to end the day when we finished the first 9 mile section. Both of us were tired from yesterday’s hiking and the second portion of our swap was a 4 1/2 mile section up and over Bear Mountain. It seemed a shame to waste a perfectly good hiking weather, but we needed the rest and we have to move on to a new motel tomorrow. So when I met Princess in the car back at Arden Valley Road, we quit hiking and drove back to Greenwood Lakes. So she hiked 9.2 (AT) miles and I hiked about 10.2. Needless to say, I’m watching the blazes much more closely now.The trail highlights today were Black Mountain, crossing Palisades Parkway and West Mountain. The mountains provided some great views of the Hudson River valley, the trees are leafed out now and everything looks lush and green. And for the first time in 3 years, I could see the New York City skyline from Black Mountain. It was hazy in the distance, but I could clearly see individual skyscrapers. Palisades Parkway was a different kind of experience. The traffic into NYC was fierce and I stood in the median a long time before I finally got a comfortable opening. I’m always surprised that the ATC was able to get authorization for an unaided pedestrian crossing at grade. This was also the first year that we haven’t seen a rattlesnake in this area. In 2014 a snake was under a bush alongside the trail just a few yards off the parkway, and last year we saw one out in the open just a little distance up West Mountain. Today started off too cold for them to be out and moving, but the temp climbed above 60 by mid-day and that’s in their comfort zone. I certainly don’t miss finding one this year and I hope it stays that way.","Arden Valley Road
",Seven Lakes Drive,"May 18, Wed",9.20
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534041,"I did a better job of following the trail today, no extra non-AT miles. We had a beautiful day for hiking, moderate temperature, light wind, dry. We did a key swap between Seven Lakes Drive where we quit yesterday and the Appalachian Trail Market. Initially we planned a shorter day and we were going to stop at Manitou Road, but we felt good and decided to do a few more. I did the NoBo leg so I climbed Bear Mountain first and it seemed a lot easier than I remember. The tower and the public facilities at the top looked considerably better than they did last year, I guess the maintenance budget went up. There is a change in the AT on the north side of the mountain. The last two years, the lower section of the trail has been under construction, but this year it was open and they did a fantastic job. The engineering on this whole section of the trail is amazing, I counted over 800 stone steps, but I think I lost track of which hundred I was on - so there may be a hundred more or a hundred less. None-the-less, the steps are incredible, they wind in and around the in-situ boulders and contours. There are placards along the way and a special exhibit at the bottom that explain how the steps are created and set in place, an incredible amount of manual labor with very special techniques.At the bottom of the mountain, there is a nice public recreational area wrapped around Hessian Lake and the AT passes right by the lakeshore. Then the AT veers off, passes through a tunnel under the (busy) US 9, and winds through the Trailside Museum. Today we learned that the museum doesn’t open until 10:00, so both Princess and I had to take the blue blaze trail around the outside of the museum, apparently it doesn’t get a lot of use and is considerably overgrown. I’d recommend that hikers time their hike to go through the museum when it’s open. For the sake of any maintainers who might read this, Princess (going southbound) saw no indication that the museum (and the AT) was closed when she went through at about 8:30 AM, until someone ran out to tell her that she shouldn’t be in the museum and that she had to go back and take the blue blaze trail. I was NoBo and when I went through the tunnel, that info was posted on the wall and I knew that I had to take the blue blaze [but I still had to step over a chain to take the blue blaze].Then we got the great experience of walking across the Bear Mountain suspension bridge over the Hudson River. I’ve never been a fan of bridges and heights, but I guess I’m outgrowing that and it doesn’t bother me so much now. I took some pics on the way across, but they look the same as those I took last year. On the north side of the bridge, the trail follows the road for a bit, then heads up a fairly steep slope. There’s a blue blaze at the top to “Anthony’s Nose”, but I’ve never gone there (0.6 mile). We finished at the Appalachian Market, a very busy market/deli at the intersection of two roads and the trail. It has great sandwiches and good roadstop food, but not a good hiker resupply stop. From there we headed to Cold Spring where we have reservations at the Pig Hill B&B (what a name). This is our first time here, and we really like Cold Spring. I’m writing this outside the Cup-O-Ccino Cafe, after a latte and a couple of local IPA’s. It’s a nice town and really lively today since it’s graduation weekend at West Point. The Academy is across the Hudson, and it seems all accommodations within a 30-mile radius are fully booked. We were lucky to get into the Pig, but we like it. Too bad we leave too early for breakfast, but Dave says he’ll be up and have coffee and a sandwich for us. We’re looking forward to a great dinner at The Depot. Interesting story on The Depot. As we were sitting outside the coffee shop a couple of hours ago, Princess happened to start a conversation with a couple sitting on a bench across the sidewalk. She asked if the man’s ice cream was good and he said absolutely. We talked a bit, we told them that we are hiking the AT, they were interested and before he left, the man suggested that we look him up on the web (George Martin) - he said he knows a lot about walking. We did, and it turns out that he was a defensive end for the NY Giants and after he retired from the Giants, he walked 3,000 miles across the US to raise money for the 911 survivors. A really nice man and he suggested that The Depot is a great place for dinner, so we plan to try it out.","Seven Lakes Drive

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534241,"Yet another super day. We tried to be quiet as we left the Pig Hill B&B around 6 this morning, but the squeaky floors made it hard. I think we woke up Dave, the innkeeper. We really liked our visit here and vowed to return when we can.We did more key swaps today, three in fact and got all the way from the Appalachian Market to the end of Canopus Lake. It was absolutely gorgeous weather, but it warmed up quickly and I worked up a damn good sweat by the end of the morning. I picked up premethrin treated shirt and pants at Cabella’s when we passed through Hamburg, PA and I’ve started wearing them as the days have grown warmer and the ticks are more likely to be active. I also have some premethrin spray for the rest of my gear. Ending up with Lyme for 2 years in a row (on the AT) has taught me that you can’t be too careful. And I keep hearing about chronic Lyme even though many organizations argue that it doesn’t exist. For those of you who are interested, I have a reference on Lyme “persister” cells that you may find interesting. And we carry doxy, but in many cases, the bulls-eye doesn’t appear so you may not know that you have Lyme until more serious symptoms manifest. Anyway, it turned into a very warm day and the long-sleeve shirt and long pants make it downright hot. The warm weather also brings out another threat - rattlesnakes. Princess has learned that the snakes like to start moving around when the temp reaches about 60 deg. They are especially fond of sunning themselves on rocks until the temp gets to around 80 deg, when they start to look for shade - often between the rocks. We talked about it before the hike today, and about an hour into the hike I turned a corner and there was a 3 to 4 foot snake stretched out in the trail. A black snake fortunately, and it slowly moved off-trail. Princess also saw several garter snakes coming from the other direction. All in all, it was a very pleasant hike. The terrain was varied, lots of twisting and turning and ups and downs. A nice waterfall, some plankwalks, and a nice flat stretch near Canopus Lake. Mostly we saw thru-hikers along the trail, the day hikers will turn out for the weekend, but I don’t think Fahnestock Park has officially opened yet. Today we moved from Cold Spring to Le Chambord in Hopewell Junction. We’ve had a hard time finding accommodations this weekend since it’s graduation time at West Point and virtually everything within a 30-mile radius is booked up. Princess contacted Martin, who shuttled us around this area last year and asked for suggestions. He was a great help and eventually we found a place here in Hopewell. We asked Martin and his wife, Donna to join us for dinner here tonight and we had a great evening with them. They are both hikers and active in maintaining the AT in this area. Martin has been responsible for a shelter and this year he’s a supervisor for the section of trail from here to CT. One of the best features of doing the AT the way we are is the opportunity to meet trail supporters like Martin and Donna. I think almost everyone who hikes the trail gains a real appreciation for the volunteer community who keep the trail in shape and improve it every year. Hats off to them. So now, we’re taking 2 days off (zeros) to visit in NYC and we won’t be back on the trail until Monday. I’m going to take a breather from the blog until then. Enjoy the weekend.","US 9, Appalachian Market

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534624,"We drove into NYC and had 2 terrific zero days visiting Chelsea & Jason, and grandkids, Logan & Avery. Logan is about 3 1/2 and Avery is sneaking up on her first b’day. Logan is a continuous motion machine and Avery is testing out her legs getting ready for that first big step. It’s the first time we’ve seen them since we started hiking and they’ve changed a lot. We hope to stop by again in early August when we’ve finished the northern end of the AT and before we head west for the JMT.When we drove back from NYC on Sunday, we relocated to the Quality Inn in Fishkill, NY and we plan to be here for 3 days. It’s clean and has about everything we need except laundry and a tub. There’s a laundromat about a half mile away and just beyond that, a Starbucks. Last night we tried out the I-84 Diner that’s adjacent to the Inn and were pleasantly surprised. The menu is very ambitious and it has a bar with decent IPA, our dinners were very good - it’s not a fine dining experience, but after all, it’s a 24-hr diner. I’m comfortable with rating it the best diner I’ve seen and I plan to go back. There’s also an ice cream stand at the end of the Quality driveway and the parking lot has been full, so it’s on my bucket list also. What about the hiking today? We messed with the sequence again today. We skipped one day ahead and did the segment from NY 52 (Stormville) to NY 22 (Wingdale). We’ll do the segment that we skipped tomorrow, there’s a good chance that we’ll get some rain and it’s shorter and might be a little easier (or not). So tomorrow will be NY 301 (Canopus Lake) to NY 52. We did manage to miss the rain today, there was a brief shower after we were back at the Quality Inn (I left my boots out to dry and they ended up more wet). We did a double key swap (separated the day’s section into 2 approx equal sections and did a key swap on each). It takes a little longer to do a double or triple key swap, but we like it for several reasons. We get to see each other more often and we get a little more time for rest & water. There’s not too much to report on the hike itself, mostly a walk in the woods with a couple of hills and many short ups and downs. There is a long boardwalk over a marshy area just before reaching the railroad tracks at the north end (NY 22). Midway along the boardwalk, it widens a bit and there are 2 Adirondack chairs. The chair facing north has “Georgia” written on the back, and the other chair facing south has “Maine”. There is a train stop at the AT crossing point just short of NY 22. I’ve never used it, and I don’t know what the schedule is, but it’s the Metro line into NYC. There is also plenty of parking on NY 22 at the north end. There are about 4 spaces close to the train stop platform, and there are parking areas just a short distance to the west of the NY 22 - AT crossing on both sides of the road. Several hikers are staying at the Duchess Motor Inn that is much further west and a very long walk from the AT. If the manager is available, he will pick up and drop hikers at the AT crossing. We’ve stayed at the Duchess the last 2 years, but now that we have a car we can get to more full-service motels. We passed Nuclear Lake today, a quiet lake in a peaceful setting in the woods. There were “No Camping” signs prominently displayed around the lake. I saw a couple who had pitched their tent across the lake from the trail. As I was climbing away from the lake I passed a lady who was on her way to suggest that they need to leave. I’m not sure why camping is restricted, I should have asked her. There seemed to be ample camp sites. When Princess passed me on the second segment she said she heard a rattlesnake alongside the trail as she passed. It was warm today, mid-60’s into the 70’s, so it was no surprise that they were moving around. She told me where, but I heard nothing when I passed through the area over an hour later. Tomorrow is expected to be about the same temps as today, however the remainder of the week is predicted to be in the mid-80’s, about 10 deg warmer than today. A final note, we passed the Dover Oak today, the largest oak tree on the AT with a 20ft 4in girth and over 300 years old.","NY 52 (Stormville)

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534785,"We expected a rainy day today and we mentally prepared. No surprise when we woke up to see rain puddles in the parking lot, so we slept in for another hour. It was still raining, but we felt better. We juggled the section order so that we had a shorter section today, figuring that less time in the rain was better. As often the case, the rain was very light and spotty. After an hour or so, we didn’t need a poncho. It was still damp and there was tree rain, but not enough to really wet us down. There was actually some sun during our last section.Today’s hike was a key swap for us and we broke the whole distance into 2 pieces. We initially planned to divide the sections at Hortontown Rd., where the RPH Shelter is located and where AWOL’s AT Guide shows a parking area. But we learned that the parking area has been closed (the local authorities have used big boulders to block any chance of parking anywhere close to the trailhead). The story we heard is that local youth were doing things they shouldn’t in the area (likely involving drugs), so they erased any parking opportunities along the road near the trail. Instead, we used the Long Hill Road AT trailhead. The AT Guide doesn’t identify a parking area there or provide GPS coordinates. But there is limited space for a couple of cars and it’s not hard to find at the top of the hill. The road turns to gravel near the top, but it’s in pretty good shape and we had no trouble getting there with our Prius.I enjoyed the hike, the trail is in good shape and provides a lot of variety. The section around Canopus Lake does a lot of short ups and downs, and many are over rocks. The trail is well above the lake near the ridgeline, so the only good view of the lake is from a view point near the northern end. From there, the trail heads up Shenandoah Mountain and there is a notable 911 Memorial Flag painted on the rock at the top of this mountain. After that the trail begins losing elevation and there is a rapid descent into the RPH shelter. North of the shelter, the trail climbs and follows a ridgeline for about 3 miles. There is a short descent to a road and then eventually to NY 52 about 2 miles later. I hiked with Geezer Hiker for a while this morning, I think he’s doing sections and he said he has done over 1300 miles of the AT. I didn’t see many other hikers but I did see 3 trail runners, they were moving pretty fast over rocky terrain - looked dangerous to me. I’ve included a pic of the 911 memorial painting, a view of Canopus Lake and a shot of the RPH Shelter privy. The privy is located on the opposite side of the trail from the shelter, so the trail to the privy crosses the AT. The whole area is relatively low and wet, so the AT is a plank walk and the plank walk to the privy crosses the AT as shown.","NY 301, Canopus Lake

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534981,"We did a short, hot hike today from the AT Railroad Station near Wingdale, NY to Bulls Bridge Road near Kent, CT. It was cool when we started, but climbed quickly from the 50s to the 80s by the time we finished and it’s currently 91. Summertime has arrived with a vengeance.We cleared out of the Quality Inn in Fishkill, NY and we’ve moved camp to the Fife & Drum in Kent. We stayed here in 2014, then we tried the Cooper B&B in 2015 (which is a couple of miles outside town) since they will shuttle. The Fife & Drum Restaurant is a favorite of ours and we don’t need a shuttle this year, so we decided to return there. Kent is a cute little town, with a number of nice shops on the main street. But it doesn’t have a reputation as a trail-friendly town, and I’m not sure it wants that. I’ve heard there’s plenty of money in the area, and some hikers are not very respectful of property. I know that the laundromat in town has had some bad experiences with hikers. However, I’ve also heard recently that hikers have been able to find some campsites in town, so maybe things are improving. Anyway, we’ve always like it here.Today was a double key swap day. The first segment was from NY 22 (Wingdale) to CT 55, so the second was from CT 55 to Bulls Bridge Road. Both NY 22 and CT 55 have off-road parking areas (as opposed to road-side parking on the berm or a pullout). Bulls Bridge Road has a road-side area at the AT trailhead with space for 3 or 4 cars. It’s not designated as a parking area, but it appears that hikers and fishermen use it and there are no signs that prohibit parking. There is a day parking area on the other side of Bulls Bridge, but that’s much farther away from the AT.We both enjoyed the hike today a lot in spite of the heat. The woods was pretty, the trail was well-maintained, lots of twists and turns and small challenges along the way. There were plank-walks, meadows & pastures, stiles, lots of small streams, sharp ups & downs, a walk along the Housatonic River with lots of rapids, and Bulls Bridge is a covered, one-lane bridge that is very close to our end point today. We also passed by Wiley Shelter that’s maintained by Martin, a friend we had dinner with several days ago (I included a photo on Friday of Martin and his wife Donna who helps with the maintenance). The shelter is really nice with a mortared fire pit, several tent platforms, a separate campfire site and a library. The “take a book, leave a book” library is on a post. And it also has a set of pots & pans on the side of the shelter. At the southern end of the hike, near Wingdale, there is a wooden water tower in a field that is very picturesque. So we had a great hike today in spite of the heat. We’re staying here in Kent for 2 nights, then moving on. And it looks like we’ll be joined by a couple of other hikers in a few days. We’re working on arrangements for that now. It’s hard to get connected with other folk’s schedules, but if it works out it’s a lot of fun sharing the experience. More on that later.","NY 22 (Wingdale)

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535122,"Another short section today from Bulls Bridge to Skiff Mountain Road. In the past, we’ve always finished hiking at CT 341 which goes directly into Kent 0.8 mi east. Having a car changes some things. Bulls Bridge Rd to 341 is pretty short and we wanted to extend today’s hike to reduce the mileage on tomorrow’s hike. It would have been great to add 4 to 6 miles past 341, but the access roads to get to those points on the trail require a more rugged vehicle. So we settled for Skiff Mountain Road which added 2.7 miles.Today was hot and humid. We did a double key swap again today (we find an intermediate road crossing where we can break the day’s section into 2 subsections and thus do 2 key swaps). We used CT 341 as the intermediate point. Both Princess and I had steep climbs at the start of the first (longer) section. By the time that we met in the first section, we were glad that we didn’t plan many more miles today. There was a pretty good breeze on the mountain that helped cool us a little, but it was well into the 80s when we finished (and after the hike it peaked over 90 in Kent) and very humid. We both drank a lot of water and I downed 2 bottles of water when she picked me up at the intermediate point.The hike today was nice, it seems like an old forest with big old trees, but there weren’t many features. A lot of sharp ups and downs without many flat spaces in between. There were a couple of openings in the woods that offered good vistas across the adjacent valleys, but no remarkable landmarks. The most interesting aspect of the hike is that we passed from NY into CT. Both Princess and I felt that the trail markings (blazes) could be improved in this section. At one point, I got off trail and resorted to Guthook to help get me going again in the correct direction. Blazes can be hard to spot early in the morning when the sun is at a low angle, especially if they’re old and faded.The blaze discussion is interesting, particularly since I just read that a number of documents relating to the disappearance of Geraldine Largay from the AT in Maine in 2014 were just released. They suggest that she was alive for 26 days after she disappeared, and well after the authorities had given up the search. So far, Guthook has done a remarkable job of telling me how to get back to the trail when I’m uncertain.","Bulls Bridge Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535438,"We did a double key swap today, starting at Skiff Mountain Road and ending at West Cornwall Road with an intermediate point at CT 4. The first leg was almost twice the length of the second, but it was the best we could do with the available trail crossings. The biggest issue of the day was the heat and humidity. By the time that I finished the first piece of the section, I looked like I just got out of a swimming pool, I was soaking wet. Today I did the first subsection SoBo and then the second section NoBo. I started off with a moderate climb and descent that took about 2 miles, then I had a long flat walk along the Housatonic River. Long, like 4 or 5 miles. It was pleasant, the river is very wide and scenic, but it was a long walk and it was getting hotter . I saw fishermen along the trail, but not many hikers. I also passed Princess and she warned me about the last 2 miles of this subsection, a difficult climb up St. Johns Ledges. Both of the last 2 years, I’ve done this part NoBo, meaning that I descended St. Johns ledges. This was the first time that I climbed it, and it was a bear. Very steep and a lot of big rocks. But all in all, I would probably prefer to climb it rather than descend it. Nonetheless, I was wasted when I reached the top, soaking wet and worn out. My remaining challenge was a climb up Caleb’s Peak and fortunately it was a lot easier.The second half of the day I did NoBo, starting at CT 4. This part starts immediately with a descent and crossing of Guinea Brook. The trail descriptions suggest that the rock hop across the brook is not safe, that many of the rocks are submerged and that hikers should look for a place to ford the brook. There is also a high water bypass trail for hikers who don’t want to risk the rock hop. The bypass trail is a mile long, compared to 0.2 mile across the brook. So I elected to test the rock crossing. It wasn’t that bad, a couple of rocks were under water, but they weren’t slippery and I made it across OK. Then I started climbing and it seemed that I climbed for an hour. Our second subsection was only about 5 miles long, but it seemed a lot longer. I was drinking water like crazy and sweating it all out. There was a long tricky down, but it wasn’t as bad as the ledges and I took it pretty slow. We both enjoyed the hike. There was a lot of variety in the terrain and plenty of challenging sections. We both agree that these CT trails are very pretty. At the end of the hike, Princess was waiting with the car at West Cornwall Road and we headed straight for the Bearded Woods Bunk & Dine. I’ve talked about this place before and we really love staying here. Every time it’s a new and better experience. We’ve been telling hikers we get to know along the trail about it, and several of them followed up and are here with us tonight. It’s pretty much everything a hiker could want. Meticulously clean, hot showers, laundry, breakfast & dinner included, free shuttle rides to nearby trail crossings, and the host & hostess love talking about the trail. Hudson and Big Lu have hiked (Hudson has done the trail 2 times) and they are a font of knowledge about the trail. Big Lu is a terrific cook and they eat with the hikers and join in the conversation. We plan to stay here 3 nights. We had a great dinner and now it’s time to sleep. I’ll try to post this tomorrow. Good-night.","Skiff Mountain Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535744,"Beastly hot is the only way to describe it, the heat wave seems endless and each day the humidity seems to grow. Good news for us, we get to hike together for several days while we’re staying at Bearded Woods. Today, Hudson shuttled us to West Cornwall Road (where we finished yesterday) and we hiked NoBo into Salisbury, CT. Everyone at Bearded Woods knew it was going to be hot, so Hudson & Big Lu accommodated us and put out breakfast early. Speaking of breakfast, it was awesome. Two egg & cheese casseroles, very fluffy - essentially souffles, one with ham and the second with turkey. What a way to start our hike. Our start was a moderate uphill, including a squeeze through a cracked boulder reminiscent of the NY Lemon Squeezer. From that point the hike was a nice trail, up, down, around and through woods and generally along Sharon Mountain. There was a view across the valley from a hang glider point, and we were treated to the engine noise from a race track for quite a while. After passing by Belter’s Bump, we dropped down quickly to the valley level for a long, mostly level walk into Falls Village. We skirted along the Housatonic River much of the way into town, including a very pretty park on the river. We encountered a hiker who was jogging toward us, asking if we had met a hiking group of 20 or so (we hadn’t) and it turned out he had gone in the wrong direction from Falls Village. So he headed back (running) the other direction. Not long after that we left the park, went past a power station and crossed the Housatonic again on a brand new bridge. This was noteworthy to us since last year when we did this section, the old bridge was just being removed and we had to do a 3-mile road walk on some narrow roads to bypass the out-of-service bridge. So this year we got to use the brand new, Iron Bridge. The trail continued upstream along the river a short distance to a very pretty falls.At this point, I was struggling with the heat and humidity. There were some flat rocks near the falls and I had to sit a spell, drank a couple of bottles of water and had a protein bar. I was sweating profusely and Princess thought I should call Bearded Woods for a shuttle back. After sitting a while, I decided to press on even though we still had about 5 miles to go and a mountain to cross. So we started a long climb up Prospect Mountain. Not too far up the trail, we stopped at a small spring and Princess filtered several bottles of water. I think I drank almost 2 bottles. It was cold and refreshing and I felt considerably better. From there, it was still well over a mile to the top of Prospect. As we were partway up the climb, we met a large group of day hikers headed toward us and in the middle of the group was the man we met on the other side of Falls Village going the wrong way. Apparently he had caught up with his hiking club group and was hiking back into Falls Village with them. I was running out of gas as we reached the top. Once over the top, we had a couple of smaller bumps to cross, but it was mostly a slow downhill with a couple of bumps to cross. One interesting feature we passed was a tall rock known as the Giant’s Thumb (photo included). The last item worth noting was a sharp downhill to US 44. The trail was a steep downhill carved into a steep mountainside with a lot of rock steps and even a wood ladder. Once we hiked downtown into Salisbury, Hudson picked us up and wicked us back to Bearded Woods. It looks like another hot day tomorrow, so I’m laying off the beer tonight and hydrating as much as possible with added electrolytes. The trail tomorrow is much tougher, so we’re carrying more water. Big Lu’s dinner creation was barbecue chicken on the grill, with baked beans, corn on the cob, potato salad and corned bread. Plus strawberry shortcake for dessert. So good.","West Cornwall Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535745,"An early start was a priority for us today, but as it turned out we weren’t as successful as we desired and it was 7:30 when we set out. We wanted to hike together and SoBo was our preferred direction for this section, so we needed to leave our car at the end point near Salisbury. After breakfast we drove to our end point and parked, and Hudson (from Bearded Woods) met us there a few minutes later after he dropped off other hikers. Then we drove with him to our starting point at Guilder Pond. The day turned out to be a carbon copy of yesterday weather-wise. It was already 80 when we started and climbed as the sun got higher. We started out going uphill, but the good news was that we started at about 2,000 ft, so our first climb was only 500 ft. It was a sharp climb, but it seemed very quick since it was only 0.7 mi long. We got a quick photo with the summit sign and then headed down a descent that was a bit steeper than the climb. Then abruptly the trail headed up again on Mt. Race. This mountain was a broader peak than Mt. Everett and it took longer to cross. Then we had a long, gradual downhill for a couple of miles and the trail didn’t start up again for another mile and a half. At the low point, there was a stunning ravine with a stream flowing down over large mossy rocks, and some swimming holes that hot hikers were   advantage of. Then the trail headed up a steep ledge along the ravine and eventually turned away up to head up Bear Mountain. Bear Mountain wasn’t the highest peak of the day, but it was the longest climb for us and we passed some hikers that we knew (going NoBo) who warned us about the difficulty of the climb up Bear. As we got near the top we agreed with them. We stowed our hiking poles in favor of using our hands and it was slow going as we picked up way carefully up the rocks. The steep part of the climb was longer than I remembered and I was rapidly getting exhausted. The last few hundred feet were really tough for me and I had to stop to catch my breath and a drink near the top. I must say, I was amazed at the number of people who were doing the trail. It was Sunday on Memorial Day weekend, so there were dozens of hikers out for a day’s hike. We eventually determined that there was a side trail that many had used that provided closer access to the mountain than either of our end points. As we were climbing, a family passed us with two children that looked to be 7 or 8. They were ahead of their parents and seemed to be having a great time.The remainder of the trail for us, from the Bear Mountain rock observation tower back into Salisbury was mostly downhill, with only a couple of small bumps. But we still had 6 miles or so to go and I was having big trouble with the heat. We had plenty of water, so I kept drinking and slowed down considerably - but it was a long, unpleasant grind. The trail was in great shape so except for a few hitches like Lion’s Head, I was able to keep on. We did resolve to take a day off tomorrow (Monday - Memorial Day). Our next challenge is Jug End which is where we start next (just past Guilder Pond) - a tough downhill. If we’re lucky, it will be dry.","Salisbury, CT

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535980,"Yesterday we took a zero at Bearded Woods. I think that’s our first zero in over a month and it felt great. I can’t think of a better place to zero, we slept in late, had a lunch in Salisbury, and generally relaxed all afternoon. I really needed to catch up on rest and take a break from hiking. We haven’t been doing as many miles per day as we did the past two years, but we haven’t been taking zeros - so we’ve been steadily moving forward at about the same pace as in the past. We’re getting ready to make another big adjustment in our hiking schedule later this week. The next 2 or 3 days we’ll continue to hike up through Massachusetts, Then we’re going to jump forward to Hanover, NH. We have an opportunity to join forces with One More, a hiker that we met last year at Bearded Woods. He is in the process of doing the last piece of an AT section hike. He is currently hiking in Vermont and we’re going to meet him in Hanover at the line between Vermont and New Hampshire. Our revised plan is to hike with him through the rest of the AT up to Mt. Katahdin. Plus there’s more, a former work colleague of Princess’ is also going to join us for a period of time. So instead of 2 of us, there will be 4. And we’ll have more vehicles, so it will be easier to coordinate slack packing. No one will have to hike alone (this helps tremendously in the White Mountains) and we can preposition a vehicle at the end of the hike so that everyone can hike together if desired. We still plan to slack all the way, and we have reservations at 3 of the AMC huts in the Whites as intermediate points. So it should be a great adventure. I’ll flesh in the details as we get closer.So today we finally got back to good hiking weather. It was in the 60’s when we started and slowly climbed up to the low 80s in the afternoon - most important, the high humidity was gone. We still had some tough hiking, we had to cross Jug End Mountain at the end of the taconic ridge in CT. We remembered that it was tough, but we didn’t remember how tough it really was. We were already at elevation at the starting trailhead and the biggest challenge was really the series of sharp descents as we came down from Jug End to the valley. The rocks were still damp from overnight rain when we started, but they dried quickly and we had good footing on the way down. We followed Hudson from Bearded Woods in our car out to our first intermediate point at Jug End Road, only about 4 trail miles from our starting point. Then we joined Hudson and he drove us to our starting point at Guilder Pond. We said our goodbyes to him, since we are leaving Bearded Woods and moving on. Then we headed NoBo together back toward our car. We took it slowly and carefully and met Arizona, a thru-hiker along the way. Our next section took us from Jug End Road to Boardman St. This section was mostly flat - farmland, meadows and bogs. Princess did it NoBo and I did it SoBo. We had a number of plank walks and a lot of roots and mud along the way. We did encounter a crew working on a section of bridge through the bog. They had set up some temporary planks for hikers to walk through. It looked like pretty hard, hot, sweaty, demanding work and we thanked them for keeping the trail in such good shape. I took a photo of them and it’s included. It's a good illustration of how much effort it takes to maintain the entire AT. I noticed a lot more synthetic wood in the plank walks than I’ve seen before. I’m sure it will hold up better than natural wood, but it’s probably much more expensive. I also noticed that I had much better traction on the synthetic surface, wood can be very slick when wet. We also passed the Shea Rebellion stone monument.Our last section climbed back up into the hills. Once again, I did it SoBo and Princess did it NoBo. Neither of us remembered this section very well and it had it’s challenges. The trail marking turned out to be a problem in several places. The blazes were inconsistent, some were very old and faded and others were difficult to find. At one turn in the trail, the blazes actually indicated a turn in the wrong direction. Princess had the hardest time. At one point, as the trail wound around past an overlook point, she ended up going in a circle. And she wasn’t the only one - a man going in the same direction had the same problem. Fortunately, he had Guthook and between the two of them, they eventually got back on track. It was a fun section of trail with some interesting challenges and it took me longer than I expected. Ice Gulch near Tom Leonard Shelter was impressive. So tonight we’re at Jess Treat’s in Sheffield, MA. This is the third time that we’ve stayed here, we have some good memories and it feels good to be back. We know the Sheffield/Great Barrington area pretty well now and where to go to get things. We contacted Marshall (a thru-hiker I’ve mentioned before) who we knew is staying in town and he joined us for dinner at the Barrington Brewery. We probably won’t see him any more since we’re jumping forward. Princess tried hard to talk him into joining us for the Whites, but he graciously declined, in favor of keeping his own pace. It’s already hiker midnight and time for sleep, we have a long section tomorrow.","Guilder Pond

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536153,"Today seemed like a very long day, and in fact it was. We used the key swap strategy with only one intermediate point and the first segment was about 11 miles. That’s an unusually long stretch for us so that made it seem longer than it was. I’m not sure if it was the terrain or what, but I was moving pretty slowly and barely did 2 1/2 mph - a draggy day. I can average close to 3 on simple terrain, but throw in rocks, roots, steep ups and downs, and I slow down a lot. But the terrain was interesting, it changed continuously and there were some very pretty spots. I did the long segment NoBo and didn’t see very many other hikers, so I really had that sense of being ALONE in the forest, listening to the birds and chipmunks rustling in the leaves. It’s a really unique feeling. I have lots of time to think about random things. And I’ve found that every day a different song pops into my head and I spend a boatload of time singing it over and over in my mind trying to come up with a full chorus of the lyrics. Sometimes I worry that I’ll concentrate so hard on a particular thought or song that I’ll lose focus on where I’m putting my feet - and suffer disastrous consequences.The “Ledges” was a highlight today. After climbing a bit, I found myself walking along the edge of a dropoff, not a cliff exactly (there were some trees below), but close. And at one point, there was a great view of the adjacent ridges and valleys. Now that the trees are fully leafed there aren’t as many views as earlier in the year, so it’s a premium moment when a real vista opens up. Another highlight today was Cobble Hill near Tyringham, MA. For some reason, I don’t remember this area from previous years, so it seemed new to me. It seemed like an older forest and the trail was very well-maintained. There was a side-trail to the summit that I almost took, but decided that I needed to press on since Princess was waiting (don’t keep a princess waiting). There were also several very picturesque ponds. They seemed very isolated and still, and the sky reflections in the water were so stunning that it was hard to break off and get back to hiking.The second segment of our key swap was much shorter, thankfully and we headed back to Jess Treat’s in Sheffield for a second night. We’re moving on tomorrow, so we had dinner with Jess at Cafe Adam in Great Barrington. We learned that it’s a third location for a very good restaurant and we enjoyed some interesting and unique dinners, as well as a good pinot noir. Not inexpensive, but a definitely worth it. We really like Jess and enjoy having the opportunity to spend a little time with her. Two years ago when we first descended on her, I was just starting my recovery from Lyme and she was great. I zeroed here for 4 or 5 days. She was really sensitive to my issues and helped me get by. As usual, it’s great to see her and we’re glad that she’s doing well.We’ve decided to do a short hike tomorrow and then move on to Norwich, VT where we’ll meet up with One More at the Norwich Inn. One More has been hiking in VT and is going to join us for the rest of the way to Katahdin. Another friend from back home in VA is also going to join us for a week. He’s going to join us for the John Muir Trail in September and he’s trying to get ready for that. No better place than the Whites for that. So after the hike tomorrow, we’re headed for the notorious New Hampshire mountains. Even though I’ve been there a couple of times before, there’s still that level of anxiety about how difficult they are. But for the time being, I’m anticipating the brewpub at the Norwich Inn, one of my favorite spots. It’s a chance to add to my growing repertoire on Untappd. PS: I did meet one interesting hiker today just after I started this morning. She was very friendly and outgoing and announced that her name was Gypsy. She said that she had a travel camper and she was in the process of doing 1 mile of the AT in every state that it passes through. She said she had just started hiking from a pond a few minutes up the trail (Benedict Pond I believe) and that she planned to go back and have a swim there before moving on. A new slant on AT hiking that I haven’t heard of before.","MA 23

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536281,"While yesterday was a long day, today seemed like it was over almost as soon as we got going. Since we’re headed for Norwich, VT later today, we decided to just do a short hike. Starting from yesterday’s end point, our options (based on crossing roads) were either 4 miles or 15 miles, so we chose the shorter hike. Although it seemed a shame to waste a perfectly good weather day on just 4.3 miles. And it was perfect, low 60s with no rain. We did a key swap and I dropped Princess off at our finish point (a large parking lot just a few feet from the US 20 trailhead) and she started SoBo. Then I drove back to where we stopped yesterday, parked the car and started hiking NoBo. The auto route between the end points included a 3-mile stretch of a very narrow, hilly, curvy gravel road that was actually one-lane in places so the drive back and forth was almost as tough as the trail. Anyway, the short piece of trail that we did do was mostly unremarkable, except for the ponds. The most impressive was Upper Goose Pond, a large pond that was much longer than it was wide. It was surrounded by forest and quite beautiful. I took a photo, but it doesn’t do it justice - I couldn’t find a good vantage point. The AT passes around one side of the pond and then heads up a ridge. There is a cabin that provides bunks for hikers and other amenities, with swimming and canoeing available. The location seems very remote, but in fact I think it was not far from the MA Turnpike and US 20. I’ve never visited the cabin, but I think it’s a destination for many thru-hikers. As I passed over the ridge and headed down the steep hill to the road, I passed at least a dozen older hikers. It appeared to be a hiking club and I asked one of the hikers how young someone had to be to join them. He laughed and said that some of them were in their eighties and that the youngest is 55. He said the oldest member of the club is 90, but he only shows up for parties. They were moving up a pretty steep hill and doing quite well, I hope I can do as well when I’m young enough to join.As I passed the pond, I came across an old stone chimney and a nearby stone with an engraved plaque. The plaque indicated that a club once stood near this point (incorporated in 1909), dedicated to good fellowship and fond memories. In 1981 the club conveyed its lands to the National Park Service and provided a gift to assure that the lands would remain a wilderness preserve. We said goodbye to Jess Treat this morning and after our hike we headed north to Norwich, VT. It’s located just across the state border from Hanover, NH. We checked into the Norwich Inn, yet another favorite of ours from past years, and linked up with One More who arrived just a few minutes after us. One More is from SC and we met him at the Bearded Woods last year. He attracted a lot of attention last year because of his companion, Jazz. Jazz is a 3-time national champion dog (I’ll provide the categories later to be sure that I get them correct), and clearly the most perfectly-behaved dog that I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately Jazz is recuperating from recent back surgery and isn’t on the trail this year. I’ve mentioned it before, but One More is hiking this year to finish the last section of his AT hike, and we’re going to join him for the rest of the way through NH and ME. It works for both of us since he has a vehicle (a little more rugged than our Prius), so now we have more flexibility to stage our vehicles. And he has no problem with slack packing. So it works out well for all. More than anything, he seems like a great guy and quite compatible with us. We spent the afternoon with him here at Jasper Murdoch’s Alehouse in the Norwich Inn and had an early dinner. We have another hiker from VA joining us on Monday for a week, and One More expects a nephew to join in for the 100-mile wilderness. So we’re pretty excited about the upcoming hikes. It will be even better if Spartacus and Focus can find time to join in for a bit as well. You can meet some really great people out here.","Goose Pond Road
",US 20,"Jun 02, Thu",4.30
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536411,"Today we started with a new state and a new hiking partner - One More. Now our team has 2 vehicles, so we can explore more support strategies. After a hearty breakfast this morning at our home base (the Norwich Inn), we set out in One More’s Highlander for the end point of our hiking section today - the trailhead at Three Mile Road in NH. Three Mile Road is a gravel road, but it’s well graded and hard packed and almost better than some paved roads around here. There was a small off road clearing at the trailhead with enough room to park 3 vehicles. So we started all our electronics and headed back SoBo toward Norwich. We had a comfortable hike with no remarkable events and about 3 and a half hours later we were back in Hanover, NH, just across the river from Norwich. I don’t have much to say about the hike. The trail is in good shape and marked well enough. We had a couple of short ups and one significant descent near the end. At one point, One More pointed to a plastic tube that ran between a number of trees alongside the trail, about 3 or 4 feet off the ground. It was attached to the trees and he said it’s part of a system of collecting maple sap for syrup production. I don’t remember seeing it before, but I may not have noticed it. Sometime later, Princess drew our attention to the stand of trees that we were passing through, perhaps 2 or 3 acres of them. They were very tall pines, with only short stubby branches most of the way up to their top. The branches at the top appeared to be green with pine needles, but the lower branches were barren and almost seemed dead. We speculated that the trees may be under attack by a pest or malady that is moving up the trees. We also observed that the trees were in regular rows, apparently all planted at the same time a number of years ago. It’s possible that this is some specific type of pine that grows this way. It was just very unusual. The downhill section late in the hike was steep, but there were enough rocks to provide footholds and even a few rock steps. The trees in this area were older pines with a thick layer of pine straw on the ground and virtually no undergrowth below the trees. When we finally emerged from the woods, we were at the edge of Hanover and came out into the Dartmouth athletic fields. The remainder of the hike was a road walk through the center of Hanover, past one entrance to Dartmouth, down a hill to the Connecticut River, across the river - which is the state border between NH and VT, and then up the hill to Norwich and our end point, the Norwich Inn. We followed the AT all the way up to the last block before the Inn, when the AT turns to go down Elm Street and on into the VT woods. While we were going through Hanover, we decided to stop at Molly’s Restaurant on Main Street and have lunch and a beverage. It was very comfortable, the town was bustling and the restaurant was busy, but we found a nice table outdoors in the back and had a pleasant lunch. A very civilized way to enjoy a hike. Afterwards, we walked down over the river and took the necessary photos at the middle of the bridge beside the border marker. Now we’ve finished our customary chores, washed the clothes, and have our slack packs ready for tomorrow. We had great weather today, cool at the start and gradually warming to the low 80s. The weather tomorrow should be much the same, but there is a likelihood of rain on Sunday with much cooler temps. Tonight is our last night here at the Norwich Inn and we plan to move to Dowd’s on Saturday. We have the option of shifting the order of the next couple of hikes, and we may do a more challenging hike tomorrow when the chance of rain is low. Weather will become a more important factor as we move into the Whites later this week.","Main St., Norwich, VT
",Three Mile Road,"Jun 03, Fri",9.80
Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536629,"We had a great day today, good weather, good hike, all is well. I mentioned in yesterday’s notes that we might change the order of hikes this week due to weather predictions, and we decided to do that. So today, we skipped over a relatively easy section and did a longer hike over two mountains while the weather was good. We think it was a good adjustment, the weather was ideal and it was a tougher hike. But it would have been much more difficult in the rain. The major targets today were Smart Mountain and Mt. Cube. We’ve done these peaks twice before and both times NoBo, but this time we decided to hike SoBo. In retrospect, that may not have been the best choice, both have steep downhill sections on the southern sides and we usually prefer to go uphill on steep sections. Regardless, we drove both vehicles to our endpoint at Grafton Turnpike and then drove with One More to our starting point at NH 25A. We left his vehicle there and headed southbound up Mt. Cube. Both Cube and Smart Mountain were very long, mostly steady climbs. Cube was about 3 miles up and Smart was over 4 miles for us. That’s a pretty long time to be doing nothing but climbing. We know there will be climbs later this week that will be higher and tougher, but we had to work at it. The downhills were more challenging - steep and some were wet. We all managed to slip at some point. The trees opened up for some good views along the way and I took some photos. We met Quaker as we started down from Mt. Cube. Both Princess and I remembered him from sometime in the past 2 years, and he also thought he remembered us. He says he plans to go all the way this year, so this will be his last section. He wished us well and gave us a blessing before we moved on. We also met Wolfman, Rambo, Mad Dog and Bones later in the hike. We encountered a number of section hikers as well and the trail was quite active. One couple we met had a very small, cute puppy. We asked how old it was and they said 5 months. Later, One More said that 5 months was too young to bring a puppy on a long hike, that their bones aren’t fully formed that early. Next time we’ll have to find a way to tactfully advise the owners of the problem without offending them. So, now the forecast for tomorrow is 100% probability of rain in this area, and we’re expecting to get wet. At least we have saved a shorter, easier hike for tomorrow, so we won’t be miserable for quite as long. We’ll do the stretch from Three Mile Road to Grafton Turnpike. If we can get an early enough start, we could finish as early as noon. The fun never ends on the AT.After our hike we checked into Dowd’s Country Inn in Lyme, NH. We stayed here last year and it was great. This year we have a larger room to include One More and Howie, when he arrives tomorrow. We had dinner at Stella’s, just a few feet down the road from Dowd’s and it was really good. Stella’s is Italian and our dinners were spot on. Now it’s late and time to turn in. I’ve had 2 really good IPAs tonight and I’m sure I’ll have no trouble sleeping.","Grafton Turnpike

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536740,"The weather weenies said it would rain today. It was still dry when we woke up and we had hopes that it would stay that way. Anticipating rain, we rearranged our schedule so that we had a shorter, easier hike today instead of a longer hike with steep climbs and rocks. We decided to hike NoBo, so we pre-positioned One More’s Highlander at the end point on Grafton Turnpike and then drove back to Three Mile Road, our starting point. Still no rain. We set out just before 8:00 am and our first target was Moose Mountain, 2290 ft elevation. The climb started after less than a quarter mile and continued for a mile and a half, all the was to the top of the south peak of the mountain. It started as a gradual slope, but quickly changed to a moderately steep slope the rest of the way up. And somewhere along the climb, the rain started. It rained for most of the remainder of our hike, mostly a drizzle, occasionally heavier, but it hardly ever stopped. The trail must have been very dry, it absorbed a lot of the water and we continued to have good footing until much later in the hike when we made the final descent. Moose Mountain had 2 peaks (north & south), both about the same elevation with a saddle in between. After the second peak we started a descent and we were worried that it would have a lot of large, smooth rock faces that would be very slick when wet. The descent did have some tough spots, but we were able to pick our way around the wet rocks. After dropping to less than 1,000 ft, we started another long fairly steep climb to the Holts Ledge area. The peak didn’t have a name in AWOL’s book and shortly after we went over the top we reached the ledges. It appeared that the AT paralleled the ledge drop-off and there was a screen of bushes that blocked the view. At several places there was a side trail to the edge of the ledge and it was only a few yards away. Unfortunately, the clouds & mist prevented any views and I only took one photo of a mountaintop sign. The last descent was wet and slippery, I managed to fall once (actually twice). It was a good hike, albeit wet - but I was happy to see the car at the end of the trek.Tonight is our last night here at Dowds, so we’re starting the packing process. If we do it right, all we have left to do in the morning is to put on our hiking gear and head out. We’re too early for breakfast here, so we picked up sandwiches for the morning. We just got a nice tour of the new tavern that the Dowds family is building on to the complex. It looks absolutely beautiful with incredible woodwork and several dozen British custom-built hand pump taps. Too bad that we’re about a month too early to sample. But who knows, we may be back next year?Howie arrived earlier this afternoon and he’s settled in with us. Tomorrow is Mt. Moosilauke, a really tough hike. Too bad that Howie’s first hike is a big one, but the weather has dictated it. It is what it is. 
PS: Howie's trail name is Greatness.","Three Mile Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537032,"The game is called “Dodge the Weather.” We expected that it would rain yesterday (correct, it did rain a lot), so we switched the hike sequence. We did a shorter, easier hike yesterday in the rain. Today was predicted to be a much better day with no rain and warm temperatures (also correct). So we moved things around a bit and did Mt. Moosilauke today, a more difficult, demanding hike. It was unfortunate because Greatness (previously known as Howie), a former work colleague of Princess joined us today for a week and we started him off with a tough hike. Now we’re trying to figure out how to fit Kinsman into the weather forecast. Kinsman is also a hard climb and longer than today with some exposed peaks. And the weather tomorrow is expected to rain with some chance of thunderstorms. So now we’re planning to pick up Rt. 25A to Rt. 25, a shorter, less difficult hike at lower elevations. Then we’ll figure out what the next step will be. We checked out of Dowds early this morning. The Dowd family is very nice and we hope to come back by this way in the future. The tavern they are building should be open in a month and it looks beautiful. Now with Greatness onboard, we have an three vehicles. We decided to hike Moosilauke SoBo, the same way we have done it the last two years. The AT on the northern face of the mountain is much steeper than the southern side and we prefer to climb the steeper face rather than descend it. Hudson at Bearded Woods suggested this two years ago and we agree. So we all drove to the trailhead at the southern end, we left 2 cars there, and piled into One More’s vehicle for the drive around to the northern trailhead. Once there, we started up the Beaver Brook Trail. In the general area of the White Mountains, there are many trails and the AT runs along a number of the local trails as it passes through the region. The AT is not always marked or identified and hikers need to know the local names of the trails that it follows. Today, we started on the Beaver Brook trail, then switched to the Glencliff Trail, then to the Town Line Trail, the Wachipauka Pond Trail, and finally to the Ore Hill Trail that led to the southern end of our day hike. Mt. Moosilauke was tough as always, but absolutely beautiful. The climb up the northside follows a cascading stream. The rains yesterday afternoon and evening were very heavy and the streams were running quite full, so the waterfalls were gorgeous. We stopped from time to time to take photos, but the trail was so challenging that we had to focus mostly on the climb and it seemed endless. This is the third time that Princess and I have done it and we can see changes in the trail each year. It seemed to us that there are more wooden steps bolted into the rock than in the past, and also more “intermediate” steps positioned to break up some of the high rock steps into 2 shorter steps. We’re not sure if the latter is true, but it seems that way. The climb took us about 3 hours to get up and over the top. If you’re hiking northbound this is the first time above the treelike and the views are amazing. We took the obligatory photos are the summit sign and then hurried down below treeline, the wind was ferocious at the top and we were wet from the rigors of the hike, so we were freezing. Once we were back into the pine trees we warmed up again and the descent captured our attention. The descent isn’t as steep as the climb, but it’s harder and longer than the descents we’ve had up to this point. Eventually the slope leveled out and we finished with a crossing of the Oliverian Brook.At the end, Princess and Greatness headed to North Woodstock to check in at the Woodstock Inn, while One More and I went back to the northern trailhead to recover his vehicle and then we drove on to N.Woodstock as well. Greatness did well today, he did a couple of practice hikes in Georgia with Ranger and he was ready to go. But all of us are feeling beat from the Moosilauke hike. So we’ll likely go for an easier hike tomorrow and hope the weather improves later in the week.","NH 25

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537219,"I think we’re having too much fun. Princess, Greatness & I are sitting here in our room at the Woodstock Inn laying out our plans for the next several days. It’s pretty complex. Tomorrow is simple, we’re going to do a zero day here in North Woodstock. Earlier it looked like rain would be a problem, that may not be the case, but we have already booked one more night here at the Inn. So we won’t hike until Thursday and then we have a tough one. On Thursday, we’re starting at Franconia Notch, crossing Mt. Lafayette and Mt. Garfield, then stay over at the Galehead Hut. Then Friday we cross South Twin Mountain, Mt. Guyot and eventually stay at the AMC Highland Center. So we have a lot of planning to do and arrangements to work out for our cars. So even though tomorrow is a zero, we have a lot of work to do.The probability of rain was 100% today, so we planned a short and easy hike and it started raining while we were loading the cars this morning. We did a section that we skipped a couple of days ago in order to get good weather for Mt. Moosilauke. We went from NH 25A to NH 25, crossing Ore Hill and Mt. Mist. There were virtually no significant highlights, Greatness and One More took one photo of a blue-blaze view point and I didn’t take any photos at all. The whole hike was in the woods with a lot of stream crossings, plank and puncheon walks, roots and mud.It doesn’t sound good, but overall it was a nice walk. There were a few sprinkles of rain as we drove to the trail, but they stopped and it didn’t start raining again until we reached the cars at the end point of our hike - so we stayed dry. The sun actually came out several times and the temp was cool and very pleasant, although I did get a number of but bites. One More’s internet research suggested that blue shirts attract insects, so I wore grey today and I can report that it didn’t help. I just hope this weather continues for the rest of the week. There was one interesting event that occurred as we were driving to our starting point, but you’ll have to ask one of us about it.We made it back to the Inn by mid-afternoon and of course, that’s when the rains showed up. They were spotty and most of the rest of the day was quite nice here in North Woodstock. We had a good outdoor dinner at the Inn, I got a free growler of Woodstock Brewery IPA and we exchanged stories this evening.All for now.","NH 25A

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539890,"Sorry for the long delay in posting. A lot has happened since my last posting on June 7. Last night we stayed at the White Mountains Lodge and Hostel in Gorham, NH. Saturday I hiked the AT section from Mt. Washington to Pinkham. In my opinion, this is clearly one of the 5 hardest sections on the AT and perhaps one of the 3 hardest. I’ll provide some description of it a little later. But first I want to fill you in on what we’ve been doing for the past couple of weeks. Most of you have heard of our narrow escape on Mt. Lafayette and we appreciate your thoughts and notes to us. We owe a great deal to Wolfman who found us and saved us from a life-threatening situation, and to the Pemigewasset Search And Rescue team led by the NH Fish & Game Department as well as volunteers from other groups who got us down to treelike and then off the mountain. We’re still working on a summary of those events that I’ll share when finished.After the Lafayette experience, we took several days off and supported Wolfman through the White Mountains and into Maine. He’s now in Rangely and doing well. We were incredibly fortunate that he came along. We’ve learned that he’s very thoughtful and deliberate, but when he discovered us in trouble on the mountain he acted quickly, decisively and effectively. And we’ve continued to hike and support One More. He has a vehicle and we have been able to use both cars to advantage.We have jumped around a bit. After our rescue, we went back to North Woodstock for a night, then on to the AMC Highland Center for a night where we rejoined One More and Greatness who hiked in from Galehead Hut that day. From there we moved on to the White Mountains hostel in Gorham. One More started hiking again with a section from Gorham to Gentian Pond and then he did the Wildcats north of Pinkham Notch. But the weather was shaky in the Whites, so we decided to move on to The Cabin in East Andover, ME and Princess and One More did the Mahoosuc Notch section to Grafton Notch. I joined him for a section north of Grafton Notch and then we hiked the section south of the Mahoosuc Notch to Gentian Pond. The weather in the Whites cleared up this weekend, so I hiked with One More from Mt. Washington across and down Madison. That is one nasty hike, we had terrific weather on Sat - I can’t imagine doing it in foul weather. One More did the Presidential ridge from Washington to Crawford today. The winds this morning were higher and more gusty than Sat with less visibility, so I decided not to join him. It’s a little disappointing since this is one of the most awesome hikes on the trail, but not in very windy weather. We picked him up later when he got to the notch.As I mentioned, we stayed at the White Mountains hostel in Gorham. Marni owns and runs it, and it’s a must stay on the AT in my opinion. You can’t miss it, the AT runs right past the front of the hostel. Marni bought it and set it up several years ago when her son thru-hiked the AT so that he would have a place to stay when he passed through Gorham. Marni is the life of the place, but she has a lot of good help, keeps the hostel extremely clean, shuttles to the trailheads and makes running a hostel look easy. She spends time with the hikers and stays in touch with conditions on the trail. She can get you through the northern end of the Whites and through to Maine. Check our the “White Mountains Lodge and Hostel” on Facebook to get an idea of what all’s there. Later this afternoon, we headed back to The Cabin where we left our car (we’ve been using One More’s Highlander). The Cabin is one of our favorite places on the trail. Honey and Bear are terrific folks with an unlimited repertoire of trail stories. Honey reminisces about hiking up Mt. Washington years ago in sneakers by moonlight. Their cabin is full of memorabilia from previous hiking guests and their walls are full of photos of them at the Cabin with legends of the trail like Earl Schaffer, Baltimore Jack, Seiko, etc. They have been wonderful to us and have helped us get through the AT sections around the Mahoosuc Notch area (cited by the AT Guide as either the most difficult or the most fun mile on the AT). They seem to know every inch of the trails up here in New England and they’ve spent years helping maintain the trails. While we’re hiking from The Cabin, Bear tasks us to carry TP sealed in coffee cans to resupply the privies (to discourage mice, etc.) and to inventory log books, pens, etc. While we were staying there last week, Lester Kenway, President of the Maine AT Club was also there and gave us some insight on the work of the MATC. Another guest was Seiko, who has hiked the AT 13 times. He made a superb strawberry cheesecake for us this evening. A major attraction of staying there is that they can slack hikers all the way from Gorham to Rangely.When it comes to hostels, our favorites up here are the Bearded Woods in CT, Green Mountain in VT, White Mountains in NH, and the Farmhouse and The Cabin in ME. That’s not to say these are the only good ones, but they are on our short list in the northeast.What about the hiking? Once we recovered from the shock of our Lafayette experience (we’re still waiting to get feeling back in our fingers but Princess’ cuts and bruises have cleared up), we have been tentative about returning to the trail. Princess did the Mahoosuc Notch again because she thought it was fun and I did the descent from Madison to remind me how tough the AT can be. And we have had some great experiences in the past 2+ weeks. We’ve seen a lot of moose and several bears. We saw a big bull moose on Rt. 2 just outside Gorham this morning and we have a video of a moose with twin calves crossing the road at Crawford Notch while we were waiting for Wolfman to finish a section. Princess has a video of a grouse taking a dust bath that she took coming down the auto road from Mt. Washington. And we’ve had a stretch of really good weather. I’ll include some of the photos I’ve been taking.So tonight, we’re helping One More plan the rest of his hike to Katahdin and we’ll head home after dropping him off at the trail head and taking his car onto the end point of his hike. We will not complete our 3rd AT thru-hike attempt this year but instead we’ll get ready for our John Muir Trail hike starting in September. Afterwards, we do plan to cover some of the Virginia and Smokey Mountain sections that we missed earlier this year, and we’re hoping that several of our friends will join us on some of those hikes.","Mt.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551201,"We’re back from CA and 2016 is not over yet, so we’re headed south to finish the sections of the Appalachian Trail that we missed earlier this year. We decided to start back by doing the section through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). It’s probably not the best place to rebuild our trail legs, with lots of long, steep climbs and tough terrain, but there are several mountaintops over 6,000 ft and if we wait much later in the year we can expect snow and ice. So we agreed to get it out of the way as early as possible and this time the weather was our friend.We plan to pursue the same “slack-pack” philosophy as before, but the Smokies are the one section of the trail that we can’t slack pack – we have to backpack and camp in the woods. There is really only one reasonable road (441) that crosses the trail at Newfound Gap, so most of this part of the AT is inaccessible by vehicle. We divided the total distance through the park into a ‘southern’ section from Fontana Dam to Newfound Gap, and a ‘northern’ section from Newfound Gap to Davenport Gap. We decided to split the northern section into two 1-day hikes with one overnight stay, and the southern section into three 1-day hikes. So we had to dust off our backpacks and break out the tent, sleeping bags, pads, etc. in preparation for 3 overnights along the trail. We left Norfolk on Oct. 14 and headed for Princess’ brother’s house in Blue Ridge, GA. He graciously loaned us his car so that we could pre-position his car at the end point of each section and avoid the need for additional transportation. We stayed overnight at his house, and left the next morning with both cars. After parking his car at the end of the first section, we drove back to a motel in Sylva, NC. This turned out to be the peak weekend for fall-foliage and the motels were slammed. We drove up the mountain early on October 16, parked our car at Newfound Gap, strapped on our heavy backpacks loaded with 2 days of food, and headed up the mountain. Newfound Gap is actually on the TN/NC border. The weather forecast for the week was warm temperatures (50’s to 70’s) with very little chance of rain – excellent hiking weather. Since we started on Sunday, the parking lot and the trail were very busy. Initially we encountered many day hikers who planned to hike up the trail for a few hours and then return back to their car. As we progressed further from the gap, we met more long-distance hikers who planned to stay out on the trail. GSMNP requires that any AT hikers who plan to camp in the park overnight along the trail must secure a permit and reserve space in specific shelters for specific days. GSMNP does set aside 4 spaces in each shelter for AT thru-hikers (1st come, 1st serve) since their schedules are uncertain and if the shelter is full where they stop they are allowed to set up their tent in the vicinity of that shelter. So hiking through GSMNP does require some planning and preparation. Fortunately, we were able to find space in shelters for all 3 nights we spent in the park. But in hindsight, I might have preferred to stay in our tent – more on that later.Even though we’ve done this trail twice before, it’s surprising how little we remember. There are certain spots, certain views or features that suddenly strike a bell, but most of the trail seems like a new day. And of course it changes from year-to-year and depends on the season, so we still enjoy it. We started out with about a 1,000 foot climb from the parking lot and much of it was through mist and clouds. There were a few scrambles over rocks, but it’s not hard and the trail is clean, well-travelled, and in good shape. Eventually the clouds cleared somewhat and revealed some longer-range views. October is a great time here, the mountains are multi-colored and cloud shadows playing across the mountain contours is incredibly dramatic. I took a few photos, but it’s really hard to capture how awesome it is.This is the first time we’ve carried our loaded backpacks in quite some time, so we were grateful when we finally reached our target – TriCorner Shelter after about 15 miles of hiking. This shelter is adjacent to the AT (some are further off the trail and we try to avoid those). It’s not a large shelter, but it’s comfortable and we’ve been here before. There was a good trickle of water emerging from a rusty pipe and a relatively new privy. There were also plenty of bear cables (lots of bears in the Smokies, so you have to pack your food, cooking utensils, anything aromatic, etc. in a bag, and hoist it up on a cable that passes over a pulley an appropriate distance above the ground). Even cooking is not permitted in the shelters to avoid any odors that might attract bears into the shelters. The shelters are 3-sided structures, open or with maybe a tarp on the 4th side, so there’s nothing to stop a bear from coming in if they want to. The GSMNP shelters are stone masonry structures with tin roofs, dirt floors, wooden platforms for sleeping (usually multi-level), and often with a fireplace built into one wall. On the positive side, they keep you and your stuff dry if it rains, but they can be very noisy (hikers come in at all hours and snore), dusty, and lots of rodents also live there. Most people become accustomed to the drawbacks after a few days or weeks, but we were re-starting so we had a hard time sleeping.","Newfound Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551204,"You could likely tell that we’re not enthusiastic about staying in trail shelters. It usually takes several hours for everyone to get settled, cook, eat and ready for bed, so it doesn’t get quiet until 9 or 10pm. Same in the morning. Early risers may wake and start packing as early as 5, while others may try to sleep for several more hours. Once someone wakes up and starts cooking breakfast and packing, it never really gets quiet again. Today we got a reasonably early start, but I never move fast in the morning so we probably didn’t get leave the shelte until 7:30 or 8. We did have motivation since we were finishing the northern section of the park and heading to a motel the day’s hike.The weather was just a little warmer and a little clearer than the previous day, so hiking was more comfortable. We had some uphills, but the latter part of the hike was a very-long and relatively steep downhill. Generally speaking, I don’t like long uphills. It’s tough cardio exercise and I really get winded and slow down. But Princess would rather go uphill than downhill and at the end of the day I agreed with her. I think our final descent was over 3,000 feet, a lot of it over rocks and it was painful. The constant hammering is hard on knees and hips, but I think my toes suffered the most and I’m going to lose a big toenail as a result. As before, there were some very dramatic views from the peaks and the trail was in great shape. Lots of reds and yellows in the trees and when the sun came out the landscape was ablaze. Some leaves have fallen, but many are still on the trees and the color of light passing through the canopy changed as we passed through groves of different types of trees. And the fragrance of pines at the higher altitudes is fantastic. It’s quite an experience.This was one of our longer days of hiking and we were grateful when we finally spotted the car at the end and had a chance to pull off our boots. It was a long drive back to Newfound Gap where we picked up our car and then headed to the south end of GSMNP to pre-position a vehicle at Fontana Dam where we would finally finish the trek through the Smokies after 3 more days of hiking. But before anymore hiking, we had one evening in a motel to shower, wash clothes, pick up some fresh supplies and get a good night’s sleep in a bed before starting back on the trail the next morning.","TriCorner Shelter

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551206,"Today was the beginning of the southern section of our hike through GSMNP. We spent last night in a nice motel in Bryson, NC and got organized for 3 day hikes, including 2 overnights at shelters. The biggest issue we have, by far, is the water situation on the trail. The southern portion of the GSMNP trail has been in drought conditions for several years and this year it’s been very severe. When we applied for the GSMNP hiking permit, the website identified a number of shelters where the water source has completely dried up and no water is available. We usually carry enough water for the hike, but we rely on the shelter water sources for cooking water for dinner and breakfast and to refill our bottles for the next day’s hike.So, for the last several days we’ve been quizzing hikers who we encounter on the trail about their experiences with water on the southern sections. We’ve heard consistently that several of the usual sources have dried up, but we’ve also learned that some secondary sources have been located. These may be no more than a puddle in a wet spot, but as long as we can dip out enough water to fill a couple of bottles, we can get by.Today wasn’t our longest hike, but the challenge was to get across Clingman’s Dome – the highest point on the AT (6,700 ft). And before we got to Clingman’s we had to cross Mt. Collins. Collins isn’t quite as high, but still a tough climb and then a pretty steep descent. Once past Collins, we immediately started up Clingman’s. The weather was cool and mostly cloudy when we started at Newfound Gap, but as we crossed Collins and headed up Clingman’s the fog and mist closed in and the long-range vistas disappeared. When we finally made it to the observation tower at the top, it was damp and chilly. We stopped to eat a bite and moved on quickly to stay warm. There is a road to the top with a parking lot, and shuttles and tours run from Gatlinburg. The weather forecast called for sunny skies and the area at the top was swarming with visitors – all disappointed that they couldn’t see past a few hundred feet. It was breezy at the top and we headed down as quickly as we could move. Our target end point for the day was Silers Bald Shelter and we were relieved when we finally spotted it. One other couple was there when we arrived, so we were assured of space inside the shelter. But they quickly told us that there was no water at the shelter – despite the fact that other hikers we met told us there was water there. The couple said they had just returned from hiking to another shelter to get water and carry it back! Princess wasn’t convinced, so she headed down the hill toward where the water used to be. There was one rusty pipe, quite dry and then a little further down the hill another rusty pipe – also dry as a bone. But the ground around the area was damp so she went further. Eventually she found a trickle of water over a rock so she scraped out a depression, waited on it to fill with water and settle, and started dipping water out of the hole with a cup. The flow was steady enough that within 30 to 45 min she was able to fill and filter enough water for our needs. Through the course of the evening a number of other hikers came in and all were able to get sufficient water. The shelter was advertised to hold 16, but more could squeeze in and it was a busy night. We made some new friends, and then turned in early around 7. The noise didn’t subside until about 10 and then the snoring started. One of the hikers had a claxon alarm on his phone that went off at 5 am. Several started packing and cooking, so we decided to do the same. We weren’t sleeping that well anyway and we had a long day ahead of us with more quests for water.","Newfound Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551207,"As I described previously, the shelter was not conducive to sleeping and when 2 other hikers rose and started packing, we did the same. Since we were about an hour earlier than usual, it was still dark when we started hiking. We haven’t had much experience with night-hiking, but it went pretty well. The trail was relatively benign in the area and our night-lights were adequate to spot roots and rocks. It also helped that we were following another night hiker who seemed to have no problem with the darkness. We could see the horizon after 30 min and after an hour we didn’t need our head-lamps at all. Much of the first half of the hike was downhill. The weather was a bit warmer than yesterday and scattered clouds provided a beautiful day for hiking. We stopped at Derrick Knob shelter to fill up our bottles in case water got scarce down the trail. We met 3 section hikers from New Jersey last night at the shelter who were pretty much keeping pace with us and we leapfrogged them several times. They were headed to the same shelter we were targeting.The high point for the day was Thunderhead Mountain and Rocky Top. Rocky Top in particular provided some spectacular views. A number of hikers were resting on Rocky Top, having a bite and enjoying the scenery. We took some photos, but didn’t stay long. We passed Spence Field Shelter on the way down. We heard there might be water there, but way off the trail and sketchy at best, so we didn’t stop. About 3 miles further we made it to Russell Field Shelter and were the first ones there. This shelter had a decent water source – a small pool, but large enough to provide adequate water for the shelter crowd. It was 0.2 mile downhill, so it was important to get enough water for the evening and next day’s hike in one trip. This shelter ended up being the most crowded of all that we used. We chose the lower platform again (important when you might have to get up during the night). Several late arrivals filled it to capacity. There were several SoBo thru-hikers in the crowd and they traded stories until about 9. Then things settled down and I slept better than previous nights.","Silers Bald Shelter

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551209,"Our 3 new friends rose early (5 am) with the loud alarm again and we climbed out and packed up at the same time. I was surprised to see several tents set up in front of the shelter, so it was a busy place. Breakfast went smoothly and we set off in the dark again. Today was our last day in the Smokies and except for a couple of climbs most of the trail was downhill into Fontana Dam. This was the first time that we did this section southbound. There are several unique features that we recognized in spite of the fact that we were going in the opposite direction. One of these is a short stretch, maybe 30 yards of ridged stone – possibly shale – and the trail seems to be notched out of the stone. Another landmark is a jumble of stone nicknamed “The Throne” that seems to form a seat. The first year we hiked we missed this entirely. This time we took pics of both of us sitting in it. Otherwise most of my photos are woods photos. The sun was bright and the light streaming through the trees was spectacular. The trees are changing colors and everything seemed to be more vivid in the light, the reds in particular. Yesterday we got our first long-range view of Fontana Lake from Rocky Top. Now as we began the long descent we began to get glimpses of the lake through the trees and finally it was in front of us as we emerged from GSMNP. Cloud shadows were playing along the shores emphasizing the contours of the slopes down to the water. The long-term drought was evident by the water level in the lake. There is a wide band of dry stone and soil between the edge of the forest and the water all around the lake. A small island near the dam looks like a small group of trees sitting on a pedestal sticking up out of the water. After we retrieved both cars, we drove back to Blue Ridge, GA and spent the night there. We decided to take a zero day, sleep late, rearrange our gear and then make the long drive back up the trail to Erwin, TN. This is the point we reached last spring when we decided to jump ahead to West VA. We plan to stay with Peggy and Mike at Cantarrosa Farm. We’ve stayed with them several times and absolutely love it. It’s a great place to stay in a beautiful setting with lots of amenities.","Russell Field Shelter

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551211,"The forecast today was colder than we’ve been accustomed to, so we slept in a bit before we headed out from Cantarrosa Farm to the trailhead. Our plan was to park our car at the Indian Gap trailhead and hike back to Erwin from there. It was definitely cooler and I had to make some glove adjustments to keep my fingers warm. The trail was in excellent shape. Although there wasn’t as much sun, I still enjoyed all the color along the trail. This section of trail is mostly downhill into Erwin and passes through some extensive rhododendron groves. And there is actually some water in the streams, a definite change from the situation in GSMNP. About the only significant landmark was Curley Maple Gap Shelter that is located directly on the AT. It’s a very inviting shelter and we remembered seeing Mobley there last year. The long downhill was hard on the feet until it leveled out as it reached the Nolichucky River. The AT narrows and climbs a little along a steep hillside as it parallels the river on the way into Erwin. Eventually the trail drops back down, crosses a railroad and then follows along the riverbank. We called Mike for a shuttle back to our car at Indian Gap and on the way we asked him to take us just a bit further on a gravel road to a point on the AT called Beauty Spot. We still had some energy and hiking back from Beauty Spot trimmed about 4 miles from tomorrow’s hike. There was a small parking area just below Beauty Spot where he dropped us off. Beauty Spot is a grassy knoll above the parking lot with some great views and a small group of hikers was setting off from there. I didn’t linger long since the wind was gusty and it was much colder on the exposed knoll than we had just experienced down near Erwin. So we moved quickly and made short work of the 4 miles back to our car. As we dropped below the knoll, the ridge blocked much of the wind so it wasn’t that unpleasant.","Beauty Spot

We did a key swap today where Princess dropped me off at Iron Mountain Gap and I hiked back to Beauty Spot where she left the car. Then I drove back to Iron Mountain Gap and picked her up after she finished her hike.I got an early start just a daybreak. I was prepared for cold conditions, but I warmed up quickly and shed clothes rather than adding layers. I had a long, steady climb through mostly open woods areas. I still enjoy all the color in the foliage and it makes for a very pleasant hike. There were a few openings in the trees that afforded good longer range views and I tried to capture those. The biggest climb of the day was Unaka Mountain, 5,180 ft at the top. It was at the end of the hike and I could see the mountain looming over me as I approached. The AT Guide noted that there is a “dense spruce forest” at the top and it was very apparent as I got close – a layer of green across the top and above the fall colors of the deciduous trees below. The forests on high mountains typically shift to evergreen trees at higher altitudes. In the southern states it often occurs around 5,000 ft., while in the northeast the transition is at lower altitudes because of the colder conditions. I saw several groves of evergreens as I climbed toward the top, but when I got near the top and into the spruce it was dramatically different. It was definitely a dense forest and there was virtually no undergrowth, just a layer of brown needles across the smooth forest floor. And there was very little debris on the ground, I don’t remember seeing any fallen trees although some must have been there. It was very quiet as I walked through, almost surreal. All too soon it was over and I walked back into a more traditional woods. Not long after I met a younger fellow hiking with his young son up towards the top. One of my standard greetings is “hi there, how are you doing?” to which he replied (with a British accent) “having the time of my life”. I commented that he was very near the spruce forest and he replied that he was from Maine where you didn’t have to climb 5,000 ft to find them. That’s true in my experience, one of the reasons that I really like hiking in Maine.We headed back to Cantarrosa Farm for our last evening there. Peggy has been away since we arrived and is due back today, so we’re looking forward to talking with her before we move on. She’s an avid hiker and we hope that she will be able to join us at some point in the near future in Virginia.","Iron Mountain Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551213,"We were packed and up early to get a head start on the hike. We have a toughie today with climbs over Little Rock Knob and over Roan Mountain. Princess dropped me off at Iron Mountain Gap and then she headed north to Carver Gap to hike south for a key swap.I started just after sunrise. Initially I had a lot of smaller ups and downs. Along the way, I passed the turnoff to the Greasy Creek Hostel. We stayed there the first time we did the AT and I remember trying to navigate down the hill to the hostel in the rain. That intersection on the trail is still a little confusing and I had to be careful to stay on the AT. Not long after the Greasy Creek turnoff I started up the hill to Little Rock Knob. I knew it would be a 2 to 3 mile climb and get steeper near the top. I’ve found that counting my paces helps me keep focused on the climb and it worked pretty well. Near the top the open woods gives way to a rhodo grove with lots more rocks in the path. I also began to notice that the wind was loud and gusty, and the rhodos provided some protection from the wind. There was one opening near the top with a good view, but mostly the trail was closed in. After the rocky knob at the top, the trail started abruptly down. I hadn’t seen anyone up to that point, but I passed a number of hikers climbed the other side as I descended. Most appeared to be day hikers hiking up to the knob. My descent ended at Hughes Gap and the trail turned abruptly uphill toward Roan Mountain. My previous climb was about 1,000 ft while the ascent up Roan Mountain was over twice that climb and over 4 miles long. It’s an arduous climb with a false summit about half-way up that raises false expectations. Lots of high log steps that are tough on knees. The peak is over 6,000 ft, so the woods at the top is another beautiful evergreen forest. I learned later from Dave at Mountain Harbour that these are Frasier firs. And the Roan High Knob Shelter at the top is the highest shelter on the AT. And it can be very cold. Just beyond the shelter the trail turns down and drops about 650 ft to Carver’s Gap, the end of the day’s hike.After picking up Princess, we headed down the hill to Mountain Harbour B&B & Hostel. This is the 3rd time we’ve stayed here. We like to get a room in the B&B, but the hostel is quite busy as well. The Mountain Harbour breakfasts are terrific, one of the main reasons that we stay here.","Iron Mountain Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551215,"Breakfast at Mountain Harbour is always at 8 am. Our preference is to be on the trail by 7 or 7:30, but we’ve learned that their breakfasts are not to be missed. Last evening we met Teri and Cliff from Texas and they joined us for dinner at Dairyland in Roan Mountain. They plan to stay here for several days so we’ll likely see more of them. The breakfast was great. Dave has taken over breakfast preparation from Mary (with Shannon’s help) and he has Mary’s recipes. Dave shuttled us up to Carver’s Gap to pick up where we left off yesterday. Yesterday, the wind was fierce at the gap and we needed our Thermoball jackets. But things changed overnight – the temp was pleasantly cool and there was virtually no wind. The hike today took us over a number of big balds and our experience over the past 2 years is that it’s a cold windy misty hike. The first year the wind gusts were nearly strong enough to blow us over. Today was vastly different. Initially we crossed Round Bald, Jane’s Bald and climbed most of the way up Grassy Ridge Bald. The weather was perfect, the views were incredible and hikers were picnicking at the tops. Then we had nearly 4 miles of descent to Yellow Mountain Gap where the Overmountain Shelter is located just off the trail. We have stayed there in the past, the shelter is a repurposed barn. After passing The Barn, we had a long arduous uphill trudge to the top of Little Hump Mountain (elev. 5,459 ft). Again, the views were amazing and the weather was fabulous. As we came off the top of Little Hump we entered a grove of trees and when we emerged we saw our next challenge: Hump Mountain. The summit of Hump is only 637 ft above the gap between the two humps, but it’s a very steep steady climb with a couple of false summits that tend to be a bit discouraging. As Princess and I climbed, we passed a hiker who was really struggling under a full backpack. I felt sorry for him, slack-packing is so much better. When we finally made it to the top we found a couple having lunch with their 2 dogs. The remaining 5+ miles of the hike were downhill to just under 2,900 ft. Along the way we crossed the NC/TN for the last time I believe. At the end of the descent we crossed US19E just a quarter mile from our hostel. We finished the hike on the high side of 2 ½ mph and felt pretty good about it. Not as fast as the kids, but still moving reasonably well.","Carver’s Gap

We started from there and hiked southbound back to the hostel. It was another picture perfect day and we really enjoyed the hike. The terrain changed a lot over the course of the hike and there were a lot of landmarks and sights. We remembered some parts of the hike, like the walk along the Elk River and past the cemetery and through endless rhododendron groves. But other portions seemed entirely new – like a walk across a grassy ridge with really long views on both sides. This is a great time of year to hike with a full spectrum of autumn colors.This was a shorter hike, just over 10 miles and we finished about 1:30 back at the hostel. We had everything packed and loaded in our car and we headed out to our next layover point at Black Bear Resort. This involved driving along US19E into Hampton, TN and then taking a curvy, twisty narrow (but paved) road up the mountain to the resort. We’re in a cottage, but it’s considerably more remote and rustic than our last B&B. I think most of the patrons are hikers and fishermen and the facility closes for the winter after this weekend. But it has all the necessary amenities (except TV and WiFi). We’ll be here for 2 nights before we move on to Damascus, VA.","Walnut Mountain Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551218,"The cottage here at Black Bear has worked out just fine. The last 2 years we’ve stayed in one of their cabins and they are pretty spartan. The cottage is quite nice, a living area, bedroom and bath with a small kitchen area with fridge, micro and toaster oven. There is a TV, but it’s only good for DVDs. Carl provided a shuttle ride for us at 7 this morning and he took us to Walnut Mountain Rd. We started there yesterday, but today we headed north on the AT. Carl retired from the Army earlier this year and was hiking the AT with his 2 sons. They planned to do a flip-flop and hiked the southern section from Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry. But shortly after they started the northern section his younger son developed a foot problem and they had to stop. Long story, but they’re helping the owners of the resort for several months until Carl’s wife (also in the Army) finishes her tour in El Paso and the family can reconnect. Carl is a super guy and he and his sons are having a great adventure.It was light by the time we reached the trailhead and a beautiful morning, perhaps even a little warmer than yesterday. There weren’t as many landmarks or features on the trail as in previous sections. The first half was over and around a number of small hills with many rhododendron groves. The latter half included several climbs. None were very long, but they had steep sections. The weather forecast predicted a good start to the day, but with increasing clouds and a chance of rain that increased in the afternoon. The prediction was accurate. We started to feel the first few drops of rain when we still had 5 miles to go. Out came the ponchos and we pushed on – a little faster. It never really rained hard and at times it stopped completely. But eventually it did wet the trail making roots & rocks & leaves more slippery. Almost all of the end of the hike was downhill and the wet conditions made us more cautious and slowed us down. But we emerged without any falls. The Black Bear where we’re staying is about a half mile east of the AT on a rather narrow road. It wasn’t really raining when we came out on the road and started walking, but a very nice gentleman driving a pickup came by and offered us a ride in the back. We gladly accepted, it certainly beat more walking. This is our last night here at Black Bear, so we’ll pack the car and move on after our hike tomorrow.","Walnut Mountain Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551221,"Another moving day. We had everything ready to go and met Carl outside for our shuttle at 7 am. We didn’t have cell service or WiFi, but Carl reported that the rain was over and we had a nice hiking day on tap. He was right, the day was absolutely splendid. Good news since we were going to hike through a beautiful section of the AT. I drove our car to the end point for today and parked it there, then Carl drove both of us to our starting trailhead. Here’s an overview of the route. We started at Wilbur Dam Road with a quick climb to a rocky knob that overlooks Watauga Lake (the sun was just coming up), followed by a rapid descent to a service road. After a 0.4 mile walk along the road, we crossed the Wilbur earthen dam that creates the lake. For the next 3 miles the AT weaved around the periphery of the lake, sometimes rising well above the lake then dipping down to the beach level. Along the way we passed the Watauga Lake Shelter. This shelter was closed several years ago due to bear activity in the area. It was reopened this spring, but the bears came back and the shelter was again closed and no camping is permitted in the area. We’ve heard rumors that it may be closed permanently. Eventually we wound around the lake to a recreational area with a large sandy beach and a variety of park amenities. At this point we crossed a busy road and started a 3-mile steady climb to the top of Pond Flats, followed by a long steady descent about the same distance. At this point we had about 3 miles left in the hike. But it was an interesting 3 miles. The descent from Pond Flats took us to the banks of Laurel Fork creek and we hiked along the creek upstream to Laurel Falls. The creek is relatively wide and cascades down a rocky course. The AT crosses the stream several times. At one point the AT diverges from the stream and climbs the side of the canyon up toward the Laurel Fork Shelter. The trail goes across some interesting rock outcroppings and offers bird’s eye views of the stream below. Then it drops quickly back to the side of the creek. Now the trail gets closer to the water’s edge and finally seems to disappear around a large rock formation. But in fact it curves around the rock on a narrow ledge not far above the water level. Once around the rock the trail starts to climb over a rock scramble that ends a hundred yards later with a terrific view of Laurel Falls. This year the falls is diminished from previous years because of the drought in the area, but it’s still beautiful. A side trail leads around to the base of the falls where swimming is permitted, but there is a dangerous whirlpool close to the falls. If you don’t take the side trail, the only other route is up a steep rocky incline. It’s not really a rock scramble since there is a path of rock steps that leads all the way to the top. But it’s a very long and tiring climb. I would hazard a guess that it may be 300 feet or more. Fortunately we have slack packs instead of heavy backpacks. The trail continues to climb, but less aggressively. Then it passes through several notches, skirts along a rock wall and crosses another creek on a high footbridge. Once across the footbridge, the trail levels off and a half-mile later pops out on Dennis Cove Road (where our car was parked). All-in-all it’s a unique section of trail, with really interesting sights and terrain and we had gorgeous weather. What could be better?(A side note for John S. and Pete S.: the last photo shows Princess with orange draped over her slack pack. It may look suspiciously like UT gear, but it’s all that we could find to hopefully alert hunters with itchy trigger fingers. At least it’s good for something.) After our hike, we drove to Butler, TN and the Iron Mountain B&B where we’ll spend the night. We haven’t stayed here before, but it’s very nice. A spacious home, built to be a B&B with outdoor decks and terrific long range views of the mountains. A short distance down the driveway is a trail that leads directly up the mountain to the AT.","Watauga Dam Rd.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551222,"Yet another incredible hiking day weather-wise. We got an early start with a fine breakfast from our host at the Iron Mountain Inn. Vicki was willing to get up in the middle of the night to fix omelets for us with roasted potatoes, sausage, fruit, homemade pumpkin donuts, fresh tomatoes, coffee and juice. The only problem with this is that I eat too much and pay for it on the first hill. Vicki was also our shuttle driver and we headed out right after breakfast so she could get back in time to fix breakfast for her other guests. We followed her in our car to our end point – the parking lot at the TN 91 trailhead. It’s right on a major road with a lot of traffic and quite a few hikers passing through. Then we climbed in Vicki’s car and she drove us to our starting trailhead on Wilbur Dam Road. Today’s hike was entirely on Iron Mountain. This mountain is really a ridge and our 16-mile hike covered most of that ridge. Most of the first half of the hike was a climb to the highest point, so much of that was gradual. But the first mile or so was a rigorous, steady climb. Even some of the switchbacks were steep. After that, it was a ridge walk. A meandering Watauga Lake was on our right for several hours, but eventually it receded into the distance. There were some good viewpoints along the ridge, but the sun was very bright in the east and precluded any good photos. Occasionally there were some decent vistas on our left to the east. We passed 2 shelters along the way, but we didn’t see any hikers until the last 5 miles or so. We saw a couple of ATV’s cross the trail ahead of us, the drivers appeared to be hunters. A little later we heard a loud sneeze, but we couldn’t locate the direction and never saw anyone. About then I wished we had a little more orange on. Overall, it was a long hike without much excitement. We hopped in the car and headed for Damascus, but found out that our reservations had been messed up. So we made a quick call and headed back to the Iron Mountain Inn where we were last night. It’s actually a little closer to our starting point tomorrow. And it appears that the weather will continue to shine on us.","Dennis Cove Rd.

Vicki had another breakfast slate ready at 7 and we enjoyed French toast (sourdough) with maple syrup, a banana dish that was like a foster sauce with blueberries, and Smithfield bacon. Yum. I took a short break from breakfast to shoot some pics of the sunrise. The Iron Mountain B&B is in an absolutely beautiful Tennessee mountain setting. It’s at the foot of Iron Mountain with the AT running the length of the ridge above the Inn, the rear of the house faces roughly east toward the flank of Doe Mountain, and the side of the house has a dramatic long-range view of Pond Mountain. The house has a deck running around 3 sides with tables, chairs, hammock, etc. The sun was rising over Doe Mountain, but the clouds to the south and west had a pink cast. I got a couple of shots – then back to breakfast.Our hike today was a long one, but no really hard climbs and a long descent into Damascus, VA. There were a couple of interesting features. At the south end (TN 91) there is a half-mile of handicap-accessible trail, the only place along the trail that we’ve seen. It extends across a meadow area. At another point an old shelter just off the trail has been out of use for some time, but it appears to have a new floor and could be functional – but drafty. At another point, something ahead caught my attention and I realized a deer was standing in the trail just ahead of me. I started whistling and the doe just stood there. I took one photo and then started walking toward her & whistling. A half dozen steps later I took another shot and she still stood there watching me. Finally she just turned to the side and walked off the trail. And near the north end of the hike we crossed the state border from Tennessee into Virginia. Good to be in our home state again. The weather today was great again and Damascus was really busy as we came in. Most of the visitors were bikers rather than hikers. The Virginia Creeper trail goes through Damascus and there were bicycles everywhere. We headed straight for The Lazy Fox, where we stay every time we come close to this part of VA.

Miss Ginny had a full house the last couple of days, but today it was just us and one other couple, Terry and Cathy. But she still put out a great breakfast. Terry and Cathy planned a Mt. Rogers bike ride today.We got a late start which made for a very long day. The weather was fine, some clouds that kept the temps down and no rain. The first part of today’s hike had a few interesting features, but the last part was largely a wood’s walk.The start was just down from Whitetop Mountain. We remember from last year that Coffee Grounds had his tent set up in the parking lot adjacent to the access road. From that point the trail went down through a hawthorn grove and then back up through a grassy meadow to Buzzard Rock. Buzzard Rock is an interesting outcropping with a great vista. Just beyond the rocks I met a couple headed north and struggling under large backpacks. They started at Springer and will try to get as far north as possible – they would like to get to Harpers Ferry. They also realize that’s probably not likely, but they hope to begin next spring where they stop this year and finish their thru-hike next year. From Buzzard Rock there is a long stretch of downhill, almost four miles before the slope changes to uphill. There are actually a couple of significant uphill climbs, but each time after the climb there is a downhill that goes further down than before. Eventually the trail levels out just above 2,000 ft. and then goes up over to almost 3,000 ft before the final descent into Damascus. There are several places where the AT merges with the Virginia Creeper Trail for a short stretch. The first time, both trails use the Hassinger Bridge and are stay together for short distance south of the bridge. The next time, I believe it’s because an AT bridge washed out and the AT detour takes advantage of the Creeper Trail as it bypasses the missing bridge. Finally, the AT joins the Creeper Trail as they both head into Damascus. Even though it was a weekday, there were still plenty of bicycles flowing along the Creeper Trail. A number of bike rentals and shuttlers have set up shop in Damascus and specialize in taking bikers up to Mt. Rogers so they can ride downhill back into town. Damascus was busier than we have seen it before.","Whitetop Mountain

And we managed to get out a little sooner. Today was a northbound hike from Whitetop north through the Grayson Highlands to the Fox Creek crossing (VA 603).Today was one of the more interesting hikes to us because of the unique character of the Highlands area. Much of it is above 5,000 ft. so it has somewhat of an alpine environment. Much of it is grassy bald areas, with scattered rock outcrops and occasional wild ponies. There is also a side trail to Mt. Rogers, the highest point in VA – although we’ve never taken it. The trail passes through several of the rocky outcroppings and although short, these can be challenging. One actually passes through Fatman’s Squeeze, a cavelike feature with a small passage (there is a short bypass trail). Then the trail passes into the Grayson Highlands State Park for about 3 miles. From this point on there is a potential or seeing the wild ponies and we saw several of them. I’ve included some photos. Princess took the best pics, the ponies wouldn’t raise their head for me. Much of the highlands is grassy meadows with a number of trails passing through. This is the first time that we’ve had comfortable weather. Last year it was raining and miserable and the year before it was cold and windy. So we enjoyed this transit much more than before. I remembered a lot of the highland area, particularly the shelter area where we camped the first year we came through. I did meet one thru-hiker today, Caddyshack who started in mid-June. He was hiking alone and seemed to be enjoying himself. Good news, he is an Alabama fan. Beyond the shelter there are more meadows and ponies and an area called the “Scales” which was apparently a livestock corral. Beyond that the trail starts to climb and heads toward Pine Mountain. The climb continues until the trail passes through 2 stiles, then starts a long descent through woods to Fox Creek, the end of our day’s section.","Whitetop Mountain

Much of it was through woods with few views. Many of the leaves have already fallen giving the trail a thick layer of leaves that was occasionally slick. It’s hard to see the rocks and roots under the leaves. We did see maybe a half dozen hikers and 4 or 5 appeared to be SoBo thru-hikers. One said she started in mid-July. They have about 500 miles left. We wished them good weather. The end of the hike was a crossing of a fork of the Holston River. We headed back to Damascus for one last night at The Lazy Fox.

But all too soon it was Sunday and we headed out of DC before daybreak to get a reasonably early start.

We hoped for bright fall colors in the landscape at SNP, but it seems that dry conditions have led to less vivid colors and more browns. Nonetheless, the scenery was impressive. At the same time, the crowds were impressive too. OK, the real highlight of the day was meeting Big Lu and Hopper on the trail! (the feature photo)! Big Lu took some time off and joined Hopper to hike some of the SNP. I was coming down a small hill and saw the two of them heading toward me. I did a double take and said holy XXXX, it’s Big Lu. It was great seeing them again. Big Lu was really enjoying the hike. We talked briefly about the John Muir Trail experience where Hudson joined us in California. She said he had a great time, and I believe he did. He was so excited about being able to hike the JMT. Unfortunately, both Hopper and Big Lu were heading out as soon as they finished at Compton Gap. That will be well before they reach Princess. So we weren’t able to connect with them after the hike. Hopper was taking off directly to visit family and Big Lu was headed directly back to CT.

This time it was empty.I approached Mary’s Rock from the south and it was good to finally get there after a long climb. For the first time, I took the side trail up to Mary’s Rock. Several families got there ahead of me and the last scramble up the rock was crowded with youngsters, so I took some photos at the Shenandoah Valley view point and headed back down. The AT was very crowded with hikers up to the rock even though it was Monday (lots of kids weren’t in school) and I even passed several groups on the way down. Nice to see so many hikers out. After a couple of road crossings (211 and Skyline) at Thornton Cap, it was a long chug up Pass Mountain. This is mostly a woods climb without many features along the way.

More key swapping today with several places to park along Skyline Drive. We’re pretty familiar with this section and lots of places looked familiar as we passed through them.

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551468,"Today was far nicer than yesterday: sunny and dry, but cooler. We had a great breakfast at the Stonewall Jackson Inn – I loved the eggs Benedict and the potatoes with sautéed veggies were outstanding. It was a good start to a good day. It felt cold at the start of the hike, low 40’s with some wind at the tops. We started out with our Zpack windbreakers. But they weren’t necessary after the first climb and especially on the sunny sides of the hills. An early feature today was the rockfall (skree) in the Blackrock area. I remember this section from previous years. Last year there were more visitors here and it appears that the maintainers have added more pebbles to smooth the trail. There were a few souls out on the trail today, more as the morning wore on and nearer to the Rockfish Gap end of the trail. There were 4 day hikers sitting on a log having lunch and enjoying the park. We probably met 15 along the way, but only a few were backpacking and most were heading north.There were plenty of sights along the rest of the trail that I remembered. A long climb up Calf and Little Calf mountains, then down and back up Bears Den Mountain. The antennae on top of Bears Den were easy to see from Little Calf, but it was a short but tough uphill trek to get to them. One unmistakable feature at the top are the 4 “tractor seats” mounted near the antenna site. The last section of the hike from a Skyline Drive crossing, over a stile, up a steep hill and over to the south end of the park was much longer than I remembered. I think this is the 4th time I’ve done this section. It’s not terribly hard, but there are a lot of rocks and I was ready for the end long before I got to it. We’ve decided to take a break and head back to Washington, DC for a couple of days. We plan to return, but not sure just where or when or which direction.","Browns Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551495,"We’re back on the trail again after 5 days of mostly relaxation in Washington, DC. We saw a couple of movies: Arrival – which was OK, but seems like an update of Close Encounters of 3rd Kind; and Inferno – that we liked much more, fast-paced, action-oriented, puzzle-solving like the other Dan Brown creations. OK, back to the hiking.We wrapped up Shenandoah last week and now we decided to move south. We considered doing the sections north of Shenandoah to Harpers Ferry, but we’re having TG in Alabama and it seemed to make sense to work on the southern connection. We decided to pick up where we left off at Rockfish Gap. These sections are becoming familiar territory to us. Counting the practice hikes we did back in 2013, this makes the 4th time in 4 years that we’ve done pieces of the AT north and south of Rockfish Gap. We’re still doing it with one car, so we have to find places where a reasonable road crosses the AT with decent parking accommodations. The Skyline Drive in Shenandoah and the Blue Ridge Parkway offer plenty of options, since the AT crosses these roads often. Today we started early, leaving DC about 6 am and heading straight for the AT. Our general flow today was north, so starting at Reeds Gap, the first several miles were sprinkled with some rocks, but generally benign. Then the trail opened up to several good views of the valley: Rock Point Overlook and then Cedar Cliffs. From there the trail crossed the parkway and started a 3-mile climb up Humpback Mountain. The pitch varied, with several smaller peaks along the way, and the steeper climbs were usually rocky. At one point near the top of Humpback the AT opened up and crossed a rock outcrop with good views to the south. The Priest was visible in the distance and the guide suggested that Wintergreen ski areas were also visible – but the sun was too bright to make them out clearly. After crossing Humpback, the trail began a long (3.5 mile) descent. The upper sections near the summit were quite rocky and the heavy layer of fallen leaves made them slippery. The last several miles of descent were more moderate with plenty of switchbacks. North of Humpback the trail climbed a bit and then continued the descent down to Wolfe shelter. This shelter is memorable, there is a stream in front of the shelter with a stone bench. I’ve taken several photos here before and one year we met the shelter maintainer, a very nice fellow. This time we didn’t see anyone in the shelter and the water level in the stream was much lower than before. Beyond the shelter there is a climb and then about 3 miles to Rockfish Gap. The only notable feature is the remnants of a house – a chimney and pieces of a foundation. The weather was very cooperative today. We started in the low 40’s with some wind on the northwest sides and plenty of sunshine. The conditions are predicted to hold until the weekend when a cold front moves through with some rain and winds, and temps dipping into the low 30’s and even lower at higher elevations. We are considering taking a zero when the front & rain pass through and perhaps heading south to start our TG break.","Reeds Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551712,"We had a very pleasant evening yesterday in Waynesboro, VA. We are staying again at the Tree Streets Inn (3rd year). It’s very comfortable and everything we need is close-by. Plus our favorite restaurant in town, The Green Leaf, is an easy walk. As an added bonus, the TV at the Inn carried the Caps game (vs. the Penguins), and the Caps won by a resounding 7-1. It was a home game, wish we were there (sort of).I was especially looking forward to the hike today. We recently joined (long overdue) the local hiking club in Norfolk, the Tidewater Appalachian Trail Club and the TATC has responsibility for maintaining the section of the trail that we hiked today – namely the Three Ridges section. It’s a challenging section. At the last meeting when I signed up to the TATC, they were planning and organizing their autumn outing to do trail maintenance – a big job. So, today I had the benefit of their efforts on the Three Ridges trail.I’ve done this section twice before, but this time southbound rather than NoBo. Starting from Reeds Gap, the first climb was up Meadows Mountain. It’s not a long climb, but it’s a good warm-up on a cool morning. Then after a brief downhill respite, Maupin Shelter appeared in a gap. I took advantage of the privy. There were 2 hikers at the shelter, but we continued on and the long uphill climb started. The climb to the highest point was about 1200 ft in about 3 miles. It was a struggle and I needed a protein bar and plenty of water to make it to the top.While the uphill was tough, the downhill beyond the peak was even more challenging. In my opinion, this is where hiking poles are most helpful, they help cushion some of the shock from big steps down and maintain balance across loose gravel and slick leaves on rocks. Overall the trail was in great shape, plenty of blazes on the uphill side. But not so many going down on the south side. There was a little trouble following the trail near a flat spot just down from the top where others had camped before. I pulled out Guthook to be sure of the trail. Good news, there were plenty of switchbacks on the upper section. Staying on the trail wasn’t a problem since there weren’t any other options (but very few blazes). After the initial switchbacks, the trail tracked along the ridge for some distance and there were several overlook opportunities. A backpacker was resting near the top of the second ridge (Chimney Rock I believe) and he was headed NoBo. He said he saw a bear with 2 cubs early in the climb, but they ran quickly away and he doubted that they would still be there. Fortunately they weren’t.Harpers Creek Shelter was a little further down, and then after a climb the intersection with the Mau-Har trail (short for Maupin and Harper I think). This trail was created by the TATC and provides a loop trail across the Three Ridges with a return path that leads hikers along Campbell Creek and access to numerous waterfalls. A quick Google search suggests that this loop is one of the most popular Virginia hikes. The lower third of the descent was less daunting with an easier grade than above, just long. And there were a number of gunshots that didn’t sound very far away, Three Ridges is a wilderness area and I didn’t realize that hunting was allowed. The Tye River suspension bridge signaled the end of the downhill none too soon for me. An angler on the bridge was lamenting the low water level in the river and the rocks were more prominent than before.The Tye River is at the bottom of the gap between Three Ridges and the Priest. Last year we thought the Priest climb was easier than expected, but this time the opposite was true. It’s not terribly steep, just endless. There aren’t many features along the way, although there is one outlook on the upper slope that offers a good view. And the top is anticlimactic, the trail just flattens out through an open woods.After that it was a trudge down and then up to Spy Rock. We never really reached Spy Rock, it’s a blue blaze. We turned downhill on the old Fish Hatchery Road down to the parking area at the fish hatchery. Our resting point for the evening is at 502 South Main B&B in Lexington, Va. This is a favorite spot of ours and we’ve stayed here a number of times, both on and off the trail. It’s a beautiful home just a few blocks from downtown. Lexington is the home of Virginia Military Institute and also William & Lee University, and we’ve found a number of spots that we really enjoy. It feels good to be back with Mary Stuart and Russ.","Reeds Gap

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551786,"We had a good breakfast start at 502 S. Main and the weather was really good. The temp in Lexington was chilly in the 30’s, but the temp climbed as we drove up to the BRP and was into the mid-40’s when we made it to the trail. It was a great start, but the first part of the hike was not very dramatic. While there were a few good views of the Priest behind us, much of the trail was up and down through the woods. Some appealing spots near streams, otherwise a long walk.After Salt Log Gap, the trail started changing character. It opened out to meadows and balds with some good long-range views. With the good weather the meadows were really fun. Tar Jacket ridge provided a good view to the east. A hiker was reclining there and writing on a pad. She was self-absorbed and ignored our greeting as we passed. Beyond the ridge the AT turned down toward Hog Camp Gap. I distinctly remember this open area, plenty of good campsites with nice shade trees. A gravel road, USFS 48 crossed this gap and provides good access. Two hikers had driven up and were preparing to set off northbound as I crossed the road.The remaining challenge was climbing up and across Bald Knob. This climb was a bit sharper than the previous hills and the top was more like a rocky knob, I couldn’t identify the bald. The downhill to US 60 was pretty steep, dropping about 2,000 feet in a little less than 2 miles. There were several good views to the west from rock outcrops along the way.After the hike, we headed back to 502 S. Main for another evening in Lexington.","Fish Hatchery Road

Rocketman & Princess,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551787,"We have been watching the weather closely all week. A strong cold front is crossing the country and has been predicted to bring some rain and colder temps starting today. But the arrival of the front on our piece of the AT was pushed back somewhat, so our starting conditions were very mild and the temp didn’t start to fall until after midday. We were apprehensive about high and gusty winds at elevation potentially reaching 45 mph with gusts of 55 or higher. South of US 60 the trail descends and follows along Brown Mountain Creek for a while. There is an interesting section along the creek with some benches and signs that describe the origins of a number of stone foundations in the area. This was a community of freed slaves that lived as sharecroppers here until the early 1920’s when the Forest Service bought the land. There are several substantial footbridges as the trail crosses and recrosses the creek. The trail is relatively level for several miles and it passes by Peddlar Lake. It’s interesting that we didn’t remember seeing this lake when we hiked this section the past 2 years. Perhaps because we hiked it northbound instead? Eventually the trail reaches the Peddlar River suspension bridge and Reservoir Road. We do have memories of camping along the road very close to here. Beyond the road the trail begins a 1200 foot climb up Rice Mountain, then goes through some ups and downs for several miles and finally starts another 1200 foot climb to the top of Bluff Mountain. It crosses Punchbowl Mountain partway up to Bluff. There is a Punchbowl Shelter just off the trail, but I didn’t stop. The top of Bluff still has the foundation of a long-gone fire tower and enjoys a dramatic view of the valley to the west. Just a few feet from the top there is a small plaque marking the exact point where the body of a 4 yr and 11 mo-old girl was eventually found after she strayed away from her school 7 miles from this spot.After crossing Bluff Moountain, the trail descends a bit, and then after 4 miles or so of ups and downs it crosses Big Rocky Row. Then the trail starts a sharp, rocky downhill. Parts of it cross a ridge and a bump (Little Rocky Row?). Altogether the change in elevation is about 2,300 feet – a significant drop in under 4 miles. The upper parts of the descent have some interesting sections along a rockface. And along the way there are really dramatic views of the James River as it winds through the mountains from the west to the east. Perhaps the most memorable feature of the hike was the winds. Predictions of high, gusty winds in the afternoon were accurate. I don’t know the exact speeds, but I was very nervous about the trees as they swayed back and forth in the gusts. I never saw or heard any blowdowns, but leaves and some small branches were flying around. The last section of trail followed along a stream leading into the James River. The AT crossed the stream several times on very sturdy footbridges. At points the stream was in a small gorge and the rock walls provided some impressive photos. At last, the trail came out at the James River Footbridge (the longest footbridge on the AT). We’ve decided to take a break from hiking for the Thanksgiving holidays. We’ll head down to Blue Ridge, GA for a couple of days to visit Ranger and his wife. Then drive over to Alabama to have TG with Princess’ relatives. If the weather cooperates we may do some hiking on the AT in GA after the holidays with Ranger and a friend of his.","US 60/Lexington Turnpike
