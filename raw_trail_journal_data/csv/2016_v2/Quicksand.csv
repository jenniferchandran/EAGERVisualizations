Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516110,"In March 2015, I decided to attempt a thru-hike in 2016. Since then I have been doing small overnight or multi-day backpacking trips on the AT in Georgia and North Carolina to get conditioned for the upcoming hike. I figured what better place to train for my thru-hike than the AT itself, and since I reside in Atlanta it's not that far of a drive. My last trip I hiked the section between the NOC and Fontana Dam. This section is by far the hardest section I've done so far! The almost 8 miles up to Cheoah Bald is rough to say the least. The views from the Jump up are amazing and when you get to the bald it's so hard to leave! I wanted to stay and camp there, but I'm training so 8 miles isn't going to cut it. When I finally got to ""Jacob's Ladder"" I was already feeling pretty spent. All the hype I've heard about this section is true! Jacob's Ladder is no joke, and half way up I told myself I'm camping at Brown Fork Gap Shelter tonight. I'm done! After hiking almost 16 miles I camped at the shelter with two other section hikers that night. The next day I hiked the remainder 13.2 miles to the Fontana Dam visitor center. All and all it was a tough hike but my favorite so far.",,Fontana Dam,"Sep 28, Mon",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516534,"I just finished a 3/2 from Stecoah Gap to Winding stair Gap NC yesterday. We got our first cold snap since last spring and it was chilly! I started at Stecoah gap on Saturday at around 10am and climbed to the top of Cheoah Bald to the most beautiful setting. The sun was out in full and the Autumn colors were glowing off the mountainsides! Once again I did not want to leave. On my way down from the bald I must have past at least a dozen hikers who were planning to camp on the Bald. I ended up camping in a cool little stealth spot 2 miles from the NOC. My plan was to get into the NOC early and have breakfast there.I got up early and was in the NOC in no time. I decided not to have breakfast there and instead bought some junk food at the little convenience store. I wanted to hike to Wayah Bald that day and camp on the top. The only problem with that was that it was 17.4 miles away and I had already hiked 2 miles. I decided to go for it even though it looked really hard on the map. The almost 7 mile climb to Wesser Bald was grueling. There is this great up and down ridge walk once you get past the Jump off views. On the top of Wesser Bald is an old rickety observation tower. As I climbed to the top I thought to myself ""I hope this is safe"". When I saw the family of twenty on the top I was reassured of the tower's sturdiness! I must have passed, and I'm not exaggerating, at least 40 people while dropping down into Telico Gap! I counted one group that had 19 people altogether. The tower's sturdiness was definitely going to get tested today! I have a problem with big groups on the trail but that is another story.By the time I got to Cold Spring Shelter it was almost 5pm I felt like I had been climbing all day long. With my slowed pace due to the hard climb and all the people I met and chatted with, I decided to stop for the day and camp up on the ridge near the shelter. The camp spot had a great view of Franklin(I think it was Franklin). I still had light until 7pm but I was beat plus I wanted to have a fire that night. I knew it was going to get cold. I had only hiked 11.7 miles out of the 17.4 I had planned.",,View Entry,"Oct 13, Tue",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516545,"It got cold last night. My sleeping pad is not insulated and the cold was creeping through it, but my Marmot Sawtooth bag kept me cozy. I woke up at 7a.m. with the sun and was packed up and on the trail by 8a.m.The hike out was fairly easy until the climb up to Wayah Bald, but even that wasn't too bad. On the top of the bald is a cool looking tower with a dungeon in the bottom of it. It's not really a dungeon but it reminds me of one. I was craving candy all morning and wishing I had bought more at the NOC. I met these two couples on the top and had been talking to them for a while. When I was about to leave one of the ladies asked me if I wanted some candy. Since I had been craving candy all morning I smiled big and said ""yes, that would be great!"" I felt like a kid on Halloween. With my sugar rush I hiked on to Wayah Gap. The climb out of Wayah Gap up to Siler Bald is a nice little workout. There is a picnic area with parking up a little ways from Wayah Gap. From there you can leave your car and hike up to the bald. This is a popular place for day hikers and once you get to the top of Siler Bald you know why immediately! I have only hiked sections from Springer Mt. to Fontana dam so far and Siler Bald is my favorite spot. On the summit the view is almost 360 degrees except for a small clump of trees and absolutely epic! There is also this intense serenity you get as you take in the view. I did not want to leave.The hike down to Winding Stair Gap was easy and uneventful. I finished the 15.8 mile hike back to my car and headed back to the ATL.",,ColdSpring Shelter>WindingStair Gap/day3,"Oct 20, Tue",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517049,"I have had a busy last few weeks. I got married to my long time girlfriend Christina on October 30. We spent our honeymoon in Chattanooga, TN and had a blast! I got sick on the last day there and was down and out for the next few days after. I am back to feeling healthy and am ready to get back to obsessing over my future thru-hike. I pretty much have all my gear figured out but I'm sure I will make a few changes here and there. I have not been able to do any on trail training for a few weeks now because of all of the above mentioned. I did go trail running yesterday and I felt great considering I have been sick. I am planning to do a overnight this weekend. I wish I could get out longer but I need to work as much as possible to have money saved. I will have time off around the holidays and plan on doing multi-day treks then. The trail running seems to really keep me conditioned so I will intensify them coming up. The whole mental game really can only be tested when I start the hike so I will just try and remain as positive as can be until then.   ",,View Entry,"Nov 08, Sun",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517493,"This weekend I did an overnight trainer in North Carolina on the AT. I did a out and back starting at Deep gap and ending at Albert Mt. I arrived at Deep gap around 8am and it was freezing. All the way up Standing Indian Mt, my fingers were numb. I passed a middle aged couple finishing up their flip-flop thru-hike and going down the mountain I met four SOBOs. Meeting these SOBOs and seeing the gleam in their eyes was all I needed to know about how their thru-hike had affected them. They were almost done and they did not want it to end. A shout out to Houdini, Frostbite, Coin Toss, and Taco! This section of the AT is not that difficult except for all the roots and rocks. I ended up hiking 15 miles to the spot were I was going to camp. I got there a little early so I pitched my tent and threw my gear inside. The camp spot is at the base of Albert Mt so I decided to run to the top free of my pack. Once I got to the top and back down to my camp spot I decided I wanted to have a fire since I knew it was going to get cold. The fire ring was up next to a big boulder. Once I got the fire blazing the heat radiated off the boulder and back into my tent that was pitched about 12 feet from the fire. Needless to say I was warm and cozy all night. My camp spot also had a great view looking down on Franklin and I knew the sunrise was going to be epic, and it was!The next day I hiked back to Deep gap were I had come from the day before. I prefer to do straight sections but sometimes I have to settle on out and backs. On my way back I passed a big group of Korean hikers. I think They thought I was a SOBO coming from Maine because they all wanted to take their picture with me. I tried to tell them I wasn't but they didn't understand so I just posed with them and let them take their pictures. Every time I do these little overnight or multi-day trainers I never want to go back home. I think I will get along just fine on my up coming thru-hike and I know I'm perfectly fine being solo. I love hiking with others but I am just as comfortable by my lonesome.",,Deep gap<>Albert Mt,"Nov 17, Tue",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517622,"This weekend I did another out and back overnighter. I started out at Unicoi Gap and camped at Wolf Laurel Top and hiked back out to Unicoi Gap In North Georgia the next day. If your looking for solitude this is a good section to hike. From Unicoi Gap to Hog pen Gap(14 miles)there are no roads(therefore no parking) which means no day hikers. I met one south bounder(Hey, Gravity),one slack packer, and one other backpacker. This section has some great ridge runs on it and feels remote even though its really not. I ended up camping at Wolf Laurel Top which is a popular spot to camp because of the beautiful view. The night was cold(got down to 21 degrees)and windy but I stayed warm and cozy. All together the hike was 35.2(17.6 miles long one way). The good thing about doing an out and back is you are committed to hike the same amount of miles back the next day as you did the first day. The sunrise was beautiful and the next day back was cold and windy but nice. I plan on doing a 4/3 over the Thanksgiving holiday. All the south bounders tell me I should do a south bound hike and I have to admit I'm starting to seriously consider it, hmmmm...",,Unicoi Gap<>Wolf Laurel Top,"Nov 22, Sun",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517802,This Thanksgiving I hiked a 3/2 from Dicks Creek Gap to Wayah Gap. From Dicks Creek Gap to Muskrat Creek Shelter is an 11 mile climb. The first 9 miles to the GA/NC(Bly Gap) isn't that bad but is still mostly all uphill. Once you get into NC the next 2 miles to the shelter are near vertical straight-up climbing. I ended up camping at the Standing Indian Mountain camping area near the shelter. It was a hard 16.7 mile day. Being that it was Thanksgiving day I saw hardly a soul. I camped next to a stream that soothed me to sleep. The next day I was out hiking around 8:30. It still takes me over an hour to pack camp and leave but I am never in a rush in the morning(my favorite time on the trail). My day started with a tough climb up Standing Indian Mountain. The only people I saw the first 14 miles were SOBOs. Most of them were in a hurry. I did end up chatting with this cool SOBO named Fire Man(he had a fire every night). It wasn't until I got to Albert mountain that I started seeing a lot of people(You can drive up and hike a half mile to the top). When I got to the top there were a few families there with huge amounts of heavy gear setting up camp at 2:30(no comment). I ended up hiking until dark and stealth camped at a spot a mile before Rock Gap Shelter. I had a nice fire and heard strange animal noises all night. At one point in the middle of the night I heard what sounded like an elephant blowing its nose. I'm not making this up. If anyone knows what that might have been please let me know.I woke up that next morning to a flooded tent. My mouth piece on my water bladder was leaking all night and filled up the bottom of my tent. No worries. I packed up camp quickly and headed for Rock Gap Shelter. While I was at the shelter I boiled some water for coffee. As I sat there and sipped on my coffee I noticed my Fosters can pot was leaking. No worries. Since I only had 11 miles to hike that day I strolled along and enjoyed the beautiful day. I decided to take the Siler Bald Shelter loop since I had never checked it out before. Siler Bald Shelter is old but it is the grounds of this shelter that makes this place an oasis. The climb from the shelter to the AT is grueling! It is basically a near vertical washed out ATV trail. Once I got to the top of Siler Bald(my special place) I hung out for a while and had nice conversations with the people there. I met another WBTH(wanna be thru-hiker) up top and he too was training for his upcoming thru-hike. after a while I raced down the mountain to Wayah Gap where I met my ride. What a great holiday weekend!,,Dicks Creek Gap>Wayah Gap,"Nov 29, Sun",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518298,"2016 is going to be a very eventful year for me indeed. Not only am I going to attempt a thru-hike but also my wife told me that she is pregnant and the baby is due in July of 2016. If everything works out right this will be my first child. Of course I am still going to do my thru-hike. My wife will just have to fend for herself(JUST KIDDING).  We both knew this might happen so we agreed that the thru-hike would still be a go. She has lots of friends and family so it should be all good(easy for me to say).Some people might frown on this and their opinion would be that I should stay home with her. I would say to them you are entitled to your opinion. The plan is that I will leave the trail for a couple of weeks near when she is due and then return and finish.   The only change I think I am going to make is leaving a little earlier(March 6). In Georgia we have been having a very mild fall. With this being a El Nino year I am a little worried about the late winter/early spring being colder, wetter, and longer. The cold doesn't bother me that much but the cold plus rain does! Let's not even talk about compounding it all with wind. I know I can just get off the trail but what's the point on leaving early. Who really knows for sure anyway. Predicting weather that far in the future is like getting into God's head(If God even has a head). Anyways, I think early March should be less crowded but trying to predict that is like...well you get the picture.   ",,"A THRU-HIKE,A BABY,AND EL NINO","Dec 11, Fri",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518578,"I have come to the realization that this adventure of mine coming up is important only to me. This huge deal that I have been working out for over a year is important only to me. All the pain and sweat from the intense workouts I was doing even when my mind was constantly telling me to stop. All the hours of research on equipment and planning both in the office and on the field. All the stuffed together weeks of working long hours and using my time off to hump up and down mountains only to sleep in a tent at the days end. All the anticipation, nervousness, highs, lows, and doubts about this thru-hike of mine are important only to me.  I'm not crying or looking for sympathy even though when this realization first came to me that's what I wanted. I'm writing this down as a declaration of acceptance. I started this journal so my family and friends could look me up(because what I was doing was such a huge deal)and follow me on my big adventure. None of my family or friends have looked me up once. At first this hurt me but when I looked closer I came to realize that of course this is only important to me. This is how it should be. This thru-hike attempt of mine is the most important thing in my life right now. All the time I have put into this is the most self serving(selfish)thing I have ever done. This thru-hike should and is only important to me. I guess what I'm trying to say is I felt like my family and friends should see it as important and big as I do. The truth is I can't expect them to view it the way I do or even really understand it. Even though I am probably the only one who reads my journal(except for a few of the class of 2016)that's ok. I am now writing this journal for myself. In the years ahead I might want to go back and read it.",,Important only to me,"Dec 21, Mon",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518794,"I am leaving tomorrow to Springer. I am going to do a 5 day test run from Springer to Dicks Creek Gap( the last road before the NC/GA border). It is a 69.6 mile stretch. I have hiked this section before but it has been over a year. I want to be familiar with the trail for my first couple of weeks of my thru-hike. It will be crowded(especially in Georgia) and I want to know exactly where the best places for water and camping are ahead of time. I spent the summer and fall hiking sections from Dicks Creek Gap to Fontana Dam so I am really familiar with that stretch already and have noted interest points on my guides. I am going to carry all the equipment I will be using on my thru-hike. My pack weight with 5 days of food and a liter and a half of water is at 27 lbs.(not bad). It is supposed to rain 2 out of the 5 days so I will get a good mix of the elements. Also it will start out real mild(70 degrees) on Tuesday and cool down significantly by Friday for a high of 45 degrees(27 for the low).  I have hiked sections of North GA during the holiday breaks before and there is always a good bit of backpackers out so I should have some company. Some of my friends have commented to me that since I am already hiking this section I should just start where I finish in March. I have thought about this and to me it doesn't sit well and plus I would miss all the excited energy in Georgia in March. I am not hiking the approach trail this time or on my thru-hike. The reason for this is because it is not the AT. I have hiked it before and it is blazed in blue and there is nothing to see. I just don't see the point in it when you can drive to Big Stamp Gap and slack pack a mile up to Springer and back down. I also feel that if someone feels that the approach trail should be a part of their thru-hike they should do it by all means. I am a true believer in the ""hike your own hike"" philosophy. Anyways, I will write in my journal about the trip when I get back. Happy New Year!",,Springer>Dicks Creek Gap/ test run,"Dec 28, Mon",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518996,"So I am back from my five day trip. On Tuesday the 29th I started from Springer at 7am. The day was lovely and mild and I felt so alive. When I got to Gooch Mountain Shelter I met a hiker named Matt who had started his thru-hike the previous Sunday. I decided to press on since the shelter was full and there were more hikers I had passed on their way. I ended up camping at a overlook about 2 miles from Woody Gap. I was trying to pace myself but with my excitement I ended up hiking 20 miles my first day(too far, too fast). I awoke Wednesday morning wide eyed at 7am. ""It has stopped raining"",I said out loud. I got up and started packing up my gear as fast as I could before the rain started back up. I was just taking down my tent when the rain started. The 2 mile hike to Woody Gap is on the side of a mountain. As I left camp and started hiking the sky grew dark and a hard rain started with lightning striking all around me and above me. There was no were to go but forward. It was a little unnerving. Hiking during a lightning storm checked off. When I got to Woody Gap the lightning had stopped but the rain increased. I ate a breakfast of 2 oatmeal pies, a kit-kat, and a snicker bar under the awning. I was going to seek refuge from the rain in the restrooms but the smell was so bad. I'm just not there yet. Even though it was in the mid 60s the rain and wind was cold and every time I stopped hiking I started to shiver. When I got to the top of Preacher's Rock the rain stopped and the sun came out. This was not to last very long. After about a half hour the fog came in thick and the rain started back up. After a hour it was a steady hard rain. I could hardly hear my headphones over the rain beating against my jacket. The hike up to Blood Mountain was like hiking through a raging downhill stream. I thought lots of happy thoughts during this stage of the hike. "" At least I'm not at work...At least I'm not at work...etc."". When I got to Blood Mountain Shelter it was flooded and the ceiling was leaking but at least it was mostly dry. I called down to Mountain Crossings to reserve a bunk at the hostel. ""I'm sorry"", said the guy at Mountain Crossings "" The hostel is closed for renovation."" Right about then Matt, the thru-hiker, came into the shelter and I told him the bad news. We both decided to hike down to Neel Gap and try to get into Blairsville to get a room to get out of the rain. We ended up getting rooms at the Seasonal Inn(I highly recommend) and had a warm, dry evening. On Thursday morning I hitched back to Neel Gap. The guy who picked me up was named Jodie and was one of the nicest people I have ever met. He told me how he had died for 21 minutes and had this after life experience. I was blown away by his story and I could tell he was telling the truth. Thanks Jodie! You are good people! Jodie dropped me off at Neel Gap and from there I hiked to Low Gap Shelter. When I arrived I smiled as I saw others that were going to be staying there. It was New Years Eve and I was looking for company and good company I found! There were 5 of us and then Matt(the thru-hiker) and Struggle Bear(his hiking partner) showed up. We all had great conversations and laughs around a warm camp fire. I met this couple section hiking from Atlanta. Spearman and Phoenix were two of the coolest and unique people I have ever met. Hey guys, it was a great New Years Eve! In the morning we all packed up our gear with numb fingers and went our way freezing all the way. The temps had dropped big time. The next two days were cold and it got below freezing both nights. I have to be honest and tell everyone who is starting a upcoming thru-hike(and who are not familiar with the AT) that the trail through Georgia is rough and tough. I am in good shape and I struggled a good bit. I finished at Dicks Creek Gap(the last road before the NC/GA border)having hiked 70 miles in 5 days and my legs were throbbing. The main thing that I learned was to pack more food. All my gear was flawless. Thanks for all the good advice Bamboops(Andrew)!I met and had conversations with a few past thru-hikers along my trip and explained to them what I was doing. All of them said that if they were me they would call the section bagged and start at Dicks Creek Gap in March. They also pointed out that I would be able to move ahead of the ""zoo"" in Georgia. The section was hard and I worked hard to complete it. In a way I do feel like I own it. I guess the only reason I wouldn't start at Dicks Creek Gap is because I would care what others would think. I wish I didn't care what others thought of me. It would be nice in a way to not have to deal with all the partying that goes on in Georgia in March. I'm asking for others input on this matter if anyone cares to reply. Happy New Year!   ",,First Five Days in Georgia,"Jan 03, Sun",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519772,"I feel like I have been stuck in a time vortex since the New Year. Time has definitely slowed down for me. The anticipation for my upcoming hike is overwhelming at times. I find it hard to concentrate on anything for long periods of time with out daydreaming about my hike. Even my sleep has been affected. I lay in bed thinking about the hike until late at night. When I do fall asleep I dream of scenarios of being on my thru-hike. I still have 55 days until my departure. If it is this bad now how bad is it going to be in 2 weeks. 1 week!Since my 5 day trek during the holidays I have been trying to gain weight like crazy. The biggest thing I noticed during that hike was how much weight I lost in such a short time. I also noticed that when I came back home my body devoured calories for 3 or 4 days after. I have never tried to fatten up in my life. In fact I have always tried my best to avoid it. So I have been eating anything I feel like anytime I want. My belt fits a little tighter and my shirts are starting to snug on my stomach. I hardly ever weigh myself and have always gauged my weight on how my clothes fit. So I can't exactly say how much weight I have gained. I have been training hard trail running and step climbing so gaining the weight has not been as easy as I thought it would be. Hopefully by March 12 I will have a nice layer of fat for my body to snack on. I am not planning on doing any more training on the AT.I might do a over night or two on the Benton Mackaye or Duncan Ridge trails but I'm not sure. Right now I just want to be at home and spend as much time with my wife as possible before I leave. I am going to miss her most of all and that could be my Kryptonite. Mind over matter will have to be well practiced. I finally got to meet my past thru-hiker advisor in person last night. We had dinner and talked about his thru-hike. I sat there and listened in awe. I could have talked and asked questions with him all night! Thanks Bamboops(Andrew)!In ending this journal entry I would like to acknowledge the late and great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tomorrow is MLK day and I would like to ask everyone to live that day in his honor. In my opinion Martin Luther King Jr. is a saint. His spirit, light and love lives on and can never be put out. God bless.   ",,Limbo,"Jan 17, Sun",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520492,I have been meaning to write this in my journal for some time now but I keep forgetting to include it. Since there is only about a month until I leave to Amicalola Falls to start my hike I figured I should do it now while I am thinking about it. If any one planning a thru hike is arriving into Atlanta and needs a free ride to Amicalola Falls on March 3rd I can give you one. My wife is driving me up from Atlanta on that day and we have room for 3 more people. If you are interested just contact me on my guestbook.

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520696,"Six years ago my wife and I went to Amicalola Falls to go day hiking. I remember seeing hikers with big packs hanging out near the falls. By then I had read a couple of AT thru-hike books and knew that these hikers were getting ready to start their thru-hikes. I remember watching them with envy thinking to myself ""how cool would it be to be them right now"". Back then I dreamed of thru-hiking the AT one day but if I was to be honest I would of had to tell you it would probably never happen. In 30 days I will be in Amicalola Falls getting ready to start my thru-hike. It seems unreal to even type that sentence out but that dream 6 years ago will be a reality March 4. I stated in a early journal entry that I was considering starting off in March at Dicks Creek Gap where I left off in January. I appreciate every one who gave me some input on my consideration. After talking with a couple of past thru-hikers(who never told me what to do but instead gave me their perspective) I decided to start from the beginning. Thanks Subman and Bamboops. I also stated that I was not going to hike the approach trail. That has changed. On March 3rd my wife and I are going to stay at the Amicalola Lodge and I will begin my thru-hike the next day on the approach trail.  This is to big of a deal to me not to get the best of the experience. I want to be that thru-hiker hopeful that I envied that day 6 years ago. I want to start at Amicalola Falls. I want to see that first white blaze on top of Springer and pass every white blaze from there on out. 
I originally was going to leave on March 20th but changed my date because of my wife's pregnancy. Unfortunately us having a child is not meant to be for now. I guess in a way it is for the best even though it saddens us. Even though my wife is a strong, independent person and was ok with me leaving I had reservations about it. Also when I would tell people about the pregnancy and my hike I would get sideways looks from them. I even got a snide, passive aggressive comment in my guest book. I should have listened to that voice in my head that said ""If you share this they will judge you"" but like I have written before everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I know I am.

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521505,"I have decided to start on February 26th. It looks like a good window and has not changed much(forecast) in a week. Right now it is forecasting snowfall on the day I arrive at Amicalola Falls. I would love for there to be snow on the trail on my start date. I also love the idea of hiking in Virginia during the height of spring. I have hiked in Georgia and North Carolina during all the seasons. For some reason I have always enjoyed the winter the best. I think mostly because of the views through the trees and the solitude. So for those reasons and lots more I am happy to be leaving at the near end of winter. This hike of mine would not be possible without the love and support of my beautiful wife Christina. Ever since the day I met her my life has improved dramatically. She has been such a important instrument during this last year of preparation. While I am out on the trail she will be taking care of drop packages, some reservations, helping me with updates on my journal, and handling all the responsibilities back home. For these and lots of other reasons my thru-hike would not be possible without her help. I probably will never be able to thank her enough for all she does. She is the greatest person I have ever known and I will miss her dearly. I will do a update on the 25th at the Falls and once out on the trail update everyday or so.

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521825,We arrived at Amicalola Falls lodge around noon and our room wasn't ready yet. Check in was at 4:00 but we thought we would see if we could get in early. No luck. We decided to hike the approach trail up to the lodge to kill time. The falls were beautiful and there was hardly anyone out. It had snowed earlier and there was snow on the ground and when we got into our room the porch was covered in snow. The room is really nice and the view is incredible! We ate at the diner in the lodge and the food was delicious. This seems like a dream to me. It is finally here. I start on the approach trail in the morning. I am going to try to hike to the pavilion and old cemetery and camp around there. That would be about 14 miles. If not there than I will settle on the Long Creek Falls area. I can't wait to start but also want to savor every moment of my last night with my wife for a little while.,,Amicalola Falls,"Feb 25, Thu",0
Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522079,"This entry covers 3 days and miles don't include the approach trail. I started the approach trail on February 26th. Within the 2nd mile I found my first hiking partner Shrink. We hiked up to Springer Mt. and when we got to the top the trees were covered in snow. The sun was coming out so all the snow was falling to the ground. We hiked on to Stover Creek shelter where we would camp for the night. When we got to the shelter there were at least 20 people there and most of them were thru hikers. No one was sleeping in the shelter (guess why.)
The next morning two people called it quits. They both said they were not cut out to be long distance hikers and it was only the 2nd day. We packed up and planned to hike to Gooch Mountain shelter. When we arrived at Cooper Gap (I think) Trail magic was waiting! Courtesy and his wife and children were there with hot dogs, chips, fresh and hot coffee! Thanks so much Courtesy and Becky! When we got to the shelter it was full so we hiked on to Gooch Gap and camped. The night was full of laughter and excitement.
We woke up today and hiked the notorious Woody Gap to Neel Gap section. Be warned, it's tough! I lost the people I was hiking with and ended up splitting a cabin with two thru hikers that I had not met before. We are in a warm cabin with TV and heat and none of us really know each other. From my experience so far on the trail, that will all change in a half hour!","Springer Mountain

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522189,So after a comfortable night in the cabin I hiked out of Neel Gap with my two new hiking partners J Fry and Micky. On my way out I met Will and Roadrunner. They are flying through the trail so I may not see them again. I'm a little bit faster than my new friends so I pull ahead and start leap frogging two marathon runners who are thru-hiking. We start to talk and eat lunch on Cowrock Mountain and I decide I am up for a challenge so I hike to Low Gap shelter with the two marathon runners. These guys were fast and they really pushed me. It was fun but I knew I did not want to keep that fast of a pace. J Fry and Micky pull into the gap and talk me into hiking farther. We wanted to get as close to Unicoi Gap as possible for there was a storm coming tonight and we wanted to hitch into Hiawassee. We ended up camping in this awesome camp spot that was opened up to the sky. We had a fire and the stars were shining brightly. I decided to pull my sleeping pad out and listen to some music and star gaze. I saw six shooting stars with in an hour. To everyone about to do a thru-hike - every thing they say about it is true. It is truly an amazing experience and this was only day four. When we got into Unicoi there was trail magic waiting! The lady who was doing the magic decided to drive us to the Holiday Inn in Hiawassee. We are relaxing in a comfortable room and about to go soak in the Jacuzzi. Tonight we are going to eat at a buffet. Life is good.,"Neel Gap

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522552,"Day6: We did not get on the trail until noon. Our checkout from the Holiday Inn Express (great place) was at 11:00 so we took full advantage of the late morning. We had to go to the Dollar General to resupply because we were too busy yesterday evening soaking in the Jacuzzi (I know I've really been roughing it). On the way out of Hiawassee we met a group of thru hikers and asked if we could share their shuttle. It cost us 8 dollars but it was late and who knows how long it would of taken us to hitch out. We got dropped off at Unicoi Gap, and our first big climb started right away. We climbed up Rock Mountain and down it and back up, then further up to the old cheese(cake-yum)factory site. Then up one more time to the base of Trey Mt...A lot of ups to only one down. Oh yea and when you get to Trey mountain you go back up for a long time, but that's what hiking's about though, right?  When I got to Trey Mountain shelter I met a bunch of cool younger thru hikers. I'm 43 which is young to a lot of people, but old to others, in this case I was probably their parents age. Lucky for me I'm somewhat immature and have a childish sense of humor so I get along well most younger people. Later, I met this girl, Emily, who was wearing a yellow and dark blue hat. She hikes fast so she looked like a bumble bee floating up the mountain. I mentioned that to her, and I think she likes the name so maybe it will be her trail name. It's fun being a part of people's trail name origin stories, I didn't know how much I would enjoy this part of the adventure. We all ended up camping At Steeltrap gap because it was getting late and because it sounded cool. I did not see any steel traps (probably just as well) but I did not look that hard. We had a fire and retired to our tents around 9:30. It was another fine day on the trail. Day7: We got up the next morning at 6:30 and were on the trail by 7. We had 9 miles to hike and it was supposed to sleet around 2 pm. All of us decided to hike fast to the Top of Georgia Hostel to get out of the cold wet weather. There were 2-3 inches of snow on the ground and more on the way so it was a good idea to duck in the hostel tonight. There are a lot of thru hikers here tonight and the atmosphere is really nice. I went into town and ate two half pound burgers, a large fry, a large onion ring, and a bunch of cokes at Hardee's. I plan to hike out early to get to Muskrat Creek shelter. There will be snow on the trail and the sun will be shining. Awesome! I will be leaving Georgia tomorrow and I have to say she was good to me. I will miss her but I will be back.","Unicoi Gap

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522786,"Day 8: After our stay at top of Georgia we were ready to get out of there, some things were good, but they closed the rec/common areas around 7pm which meant for a long evening crammed into a bunkhouse. Simply staying open a little later would provide much improvement. We get dropped off at Dick's Creek Gap in the bitter cold, and we all decide to hike to Bly gap and meet there. As I make my way to Bly Gap I run into Mud Puppy. He is also a trail runner so our paces match each other. We see snow everywhere along the trail as we are hiking. Lots of shoe skiing being done on the downs. We reach the GA/NC border and queue in line for photos. We get to Bly gap, and by 5 there are at least 15 tents up. We have a fire, and sit and talk until 9 when we all go to our tents for the night. Day 9 I wake up from another cold and restless night's sleep. I need to get a liner for my bag. I guess this Florida boy has thin blood. We hang out late in the morning until 9:45 before we decide to get moving. I hike out with Mud Puppy and we decide to join and become Team Quick Puppy because Mud Sand sounds too weird. He becomes my third hiking partner so far! We hike once again in snow. The surroundings are gorgeous and tranquil. We hike up and over Standing Indian Mountain and into Beech Gap where we tent with 4 other thru hikers. I have been leap frogging this couple from Switzerland. Their names are Bowler and Pinky Toe and I like them immediately. We all decide to team up and hike together. We make plans to hike 15 1/2 miles the next day so we can get close to Winding Stair Gap to get into Franklin early. We have a fire that night but it starts to sleet so we all go into our tents for the night. DAY 10 we hike out of Beech Gap as 4. Team Quick Puppy and Team Switzerland has united. We are working on a name but nothing as the right ring to it. We hike a long 15.4 to Rock Gap where we decide to camp. It has a big yellow sign that says No Camping but we are thru hikers and we don't believe in big yellow signs that say anything :-) We will have an easy 4 mile hike to Winding Stair Gap tomorrow where we will take the 9am shuttle to Candy Land.","Dick's Creek Gap

We hiked the 4 miles to Winding Stair Gap to catch our 9am shuttle to the Budget Inn. It took a full hour of hiking before I had feeling in my fingers. These cold mornings have been brutal. When we got into town we went straight for the Kountry Kitchen and ate enough food for a football team. After brunch we go back to our rooms to do chores. Even in town you never get to fully relax. We all go to eat dinner and I get fried oysters. So good! After dinner we all go to the Lazy Hiker and relax by the fire and talk and laugh.

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523252,"I awake at 8:00 am in a bed at the budget inn in Franklin. I instantly feel the effects of all the food I ate the day before. I have a major food hang over and I don't want to go anywhere. I debate whether I should take a zero or not and decide on the latter. We get shuttled in to Winding Stair Gap and hike to the top of Siler Bald and hang out for over an hour admiring the 360 view. We then hike down to the Wayah Gap picnic area and camp for the night. There are about 12 of us there tonight. At around 9:00 I discover my Kindle is not working. I think the frigid nights ruined it. I decide to just go to sleep. As I lie down my air pad blows 2 seams and it bubbles out making it useless to sleep on. I get out of my tent and push a bunch of leaves under my tent for padding, and sleep well considering. The night was wonderful despite mishaps. The weather was mild and everyone got a great nights rest. It is a lot easier to sleep in a refrigerator than a freezer!The next day, I decided to hike ahead of the group to get to the NOC to purchase a new pad. The only problem with this is that the NOC is 21.7 miles away. I put it in high gear and fly up the trail. I go through 2 trail magic setups not having time to stop. I get to Wesser Bald and have to climb to the observation deck and check out the view. I'm willing to miss trail magic but not the views. I hike all day and by 5:45 I get to the Rufus Morgan Shelter. It is still a mile to the NOC but I knew the outfitter was closed already. After hiking 20.7 miles of tough terrain I was tired. I decided to make a huge leaf pile and plop my tent down on it. I ate then I went up to the shelter and hung out with a group of young thru hikers that I had seen on and off. The weather was mild again and the leaf bed was not that bad. I slept like a baby.","Winding Stair Gap / Franklin

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523345,"March 10 I take my time packing up in the morning considering the NOC doesn't open until 8am and I am only a mile away. I get into town and eat a nice breakfast and drink hot coffee. I am meeting my wife on Saturday (today is Thursday)and I am staying put until then. Since I got into the NOC earlier than expected I will be taking a 1 mile nero and 2 zeros. I don't need this much time off but I want to see my wife badly. I got a 2 bunk cabin with Mud Puppy and the rest of the group gets an 8 person cabin. The bunks are rustic, but I like them. They remind me of summer camp back when I was a kid. I shower for about 45 minutes. Then I meet the group for dinner. By now we all have huge appetites and can eat massive amounts of food. After dinner we all hang out on the porch until about 10:30 when we go back to our rooms to sleep. I sleep incredibly well this night now that I am not relying on leaves as my source of comfort.March 11 I wake up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Today will be my first official zero and marks 2 weeks on the trail. When I tell you it feels more like 2 months, I'm not exaggerating. Time does a weird thing on the trail that is hard to explain. Even though the days go by quickly, events seem so far apart. Like I said, it is hard to explain. I eat breakfast and drink 5 cups of coffee with lots of sugar and creamer. Back home I always drank my coffee black and didn't like to drink calories. Things have changed! Every cup of coffee is like a sweet caffeinated dessert. Delicious! I have also tried every Fanta flavor and countless combinations of flavors. I highly recommend 1 part pineapple and 1 part strawberry with a splash of grape. After breakfast I go to the outfitter to pickup a package, a new air pad and register for the Smokies. The rest of the day is spent lounging by the river soaking my feet in the cold water. The NOC is a great place to take a zero. The place has great energy and the summer camp feel which reminds me of being a kid with no worries in the world. The whole day is sunny and in the low 70's. Is this really March? I go through phases where I feel like I am dreaming. This lifestyle is intoxicating and I think I am becoming addicted to it. We stay up late and sleep well.March 12 I awake today excited because I am going to see my wife and spend the whole day and night with her. When she arrives, I introduce her to everyone and we hang out by the river talking. There is trail magic going on and new thru-hiker faces keep coming down the mountain. Everyone keeps talking about the horde and how they want to get ahead of it. I guess a lot of people started this past weekend and it is referred to by hikers ahead as the horde-like a zombie horde from the Walking Dead :-) To me it just seems like spurts of hikers here and there.  My wife and I drive to our hotel room and hang out and have a great time! We decide that I will slack pack from the NOC to Yellow Creek Mountain Road tomorrow where my wife will meet me with my pack. This will be a 21 mile day including the climb up to Cheoah Bald and Jacob's Ladder. With all the rest and without my pack I should be able to pull it off. We will see.","Rufus Morgan Shelter

I have been hiking with a group of 9 since leaving Fontana. I never thought I would be in such a big group but it has been fun. We don't all hike together throughout the day, we usually hike in pairs or solo and meet up at views and at camp each evening. I have met so many wonderful people along the trail.  I still have not seen the thru-hiker horde yet. Instead I have been in the middle of the spring break section hiker horde. They stick out like healthy thumbs in the midst of the thru-hikers. I plan on hiking out on Sunday and there is a chance of snow. As has been mentioned by many previous hikers, Gatlinburg has been a shock to the system, so I'm fine with moving on and taking a chance with the snowy weather. I'm looking forward to the rest of the Smokies and making my way to Hot Springs next weekend.","NOC

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524569,Sunday 03/20/16 (Day 24) We left Gatlinburg and headed back to Newfound Gap. As we drove to higher elevations frozen fog began to appear. When we got to the top it was like a winter wonderland. I kissed my wife goodbye and hiked up 10.3 milestone Pecks Corner shelter. Halfway through the hike it began sleeting and visibility was about 10 feet. There were no views on Charlies Bunion for it was in a cloud. The shelter that night was full to the brim and the temp was dropping fast. We woke up the next day to 4-6 inches of fresh powder on the trail. The temperature dropped to 9 degrees that night and the morning was bitter cold.  Monday 03/21/16 (Day 25) A few hikers zeroed in the shelter because the snow was so thick. Most of us opted to go for it and hike 12.6 miles to Cosby knob shelter. We all agreed it was the hardest 12 miles so far. I felt like I was hiking up and down massive sand dunes. The only thing that was keeping me warm was constant motion. When we came to views it was like a alpine winter wonderland on the top and green down below. The incredible views were the only thing keeping my spirits up. We finally got to the shelter and ate then jumped into our sleeping bags.  Tuesday 03/22/16 (Day 26) We woke up the next morning early and hiked out. We hiked through Davenport gap and were out of the Smokies. The Smokies were the best hiking so far but the rules and regulations get suffocating after a while. We stopped in at Standing Bear hostel and resupplied and relaxed. I really liked Standing Bear Hostel and the vibe was good. I highly recommend stopping in or staying the night. I would have stayed but it was still early so we hiked up 2 miles to a camp spot were we are staying for the night. We are happy tonight and not freezing.

Quicksand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525111,"03/24/2016 (Day 28) - I made it into Hot Springs around one in the afternoon on Thursday. This was a major milestone for me. Up until now, I have focused on hiking to Hot Springs as my goal (taking the AT in small pieces to make it less overwhelming), and now I'm here! When I arrived I got a bunk at the Laughing Heart Hostel. Once I dropped my gear on my bunk it was off to go eat town food. I'm at the point now where town food takes priority over everything else. Even though I was sweaty, smelly, and had dirty clothes on, I had to go eat before showering. Hot Springs is a nice little town. It has a few restaurants and they all were good. Through no fault of the hostel, I slept terribly that night due to a drunk, snoring hiker in the bunkroom. I told myself from now on if at all possible I will get private rooms.  The next day, Friday 03/25/2016 (Day 29), I moved into a private room at the hostel. We all went down to the river where Handles (a thru hiker) was cooking hamburgers and hotdogs for the hikers with his parents. We ate by the river and lounged around all day. That night I slept like a baby in my private room. Laughing Heart Hostel is my favorite hostel so far. The managers Tye and Solo are the best and they are so laid back.  Saturday 03/26/2016 (Day 30) - I did not want to leave the hostel or the town and I seriously considered taking another zero but decided that would not be a good idea. Most of the hikers I had been hiking on and off with were still in Hot Springs when I left with Unicorn.  Sunday 03/27/2016 (Day 31) - I have been hiking with Unicorn for a few days now so I may have a new hiking partner. (Mud puppy left the trail in Hot Springs to go back to work - He only had a month to hike). We camped at Deep Gap last night and we both slept well. We woke up this morning and hiked 24 miles to Hikers Paradise hostel. This is a new hostel and Unicorn & I have it all to ourselves. It is a cool place and the owner is super nice.

The hostel itself is a small place.Jerry the owner says ""it is a work in progress""and in my opinion he is off to a great start. He has good food resupply, everything a hiker might need. Also he has frozen food(burgers, pizza,breakfast)and plenty of cold drinks(no alcohol)a thirsty hiker would want. The bunks were comfy and the pillows new and fluffy. I slept with blacky the cat(the hostel mascot) all night. It made me miss my cats a lot. Hey J Mac and Chili! Jerry is one of the coolest people i have met so far and his young son is hilarious. If you are into small,humble, feel at home hostels you should check it out.I hiked out the next morning with Unicorn. We were hiking good and steady but i was feeling worn down. The last couple of days i have not been feeling myself. We hiked about 13 miles to Low Gap to camp. We had a big fire because it was freezing and retired to our tents around 9 pm. i awoke in the middle of the night to Unicorn throwing up. This continued all night long and i felt so bad for him. In the morning all he was doing was dry heaving because there was nothing left to come out. I kept asking him if he was ok but there was nothing i could do for him and we were in the middle of the woods. In the morning i hiked back to Sams Gap with him. He needed to get help and going back was the quickest route. He told me to go on but there was no way i was going to leave him alone in his condition. Even though we have only known each other for a couple of weeks Unicorn has become a good friend of mine. It does not take long to form brother-like bonds with other hikers. When we got back to the gap i called Uncle Johnny and let him know what was going on. He got us a ride to Erwin so Unicorn can get help and rest in a motel room. It turns out he has norovirus. He is the fifth hiker that i know personally that has caught the virus. I dont know if i have it but it is extremely contagious and i have been hiking with Unicorn for the last few days.I am going to zero here for a day or two just in case because i do not want to be in the woods if it comes on. I have been stressed out about this decision because lately we have been crushing the miles to get ahead. To be honest i am tired of rushing and i am going back to taking my time.

Unicorn recovered and he, Alpha, and I got back on the trail after a couple of zeros in Erwin. The first day out was nice and went smoothly. The second day out we were all supposed to meet at Roan High Knob Shelter to camp. The day was cold and windy and I was hiking fast. Some days it's so cold that all I can do to stay warm is to hike fast and non stop. When I got to the top of Roan Mountain I was surprised at the ease it took. I had heard so much hype about it. I arrived at the shelter at around 3pm and my fingers were already numbing from the cold. I wrote in the journal to everyone that I was pushing on to lower elevations. After climbing down Roan Mountain I had a series of balds to climb. The wind was so strong that it was blowing me off the trail. I ended up hiking 25 miles to Overmountain Shelter where I camped for the night.  The shelter was full so I pitched my tent. This was a bad idea. All night the wind pushed my tent on top of me and I feared my tent poles were going to snap. I hardly slept all night due to this. The next morning the wind was blowing even harder and it was bitter cold. I have a Nemo 1 person Hornet tent. This tent is super durable. It held up to 50 mile per hour gusts and has been an all around great tent. I highly recommend it especially for a thru hike. I packed up camp as best as I could considering how windy and cold it was and the lack of feeling in my fingers. I had 5 miles of high balds to climb and it was going to be brutal. The next 2 hours was hell on earth surrounded by gorgeous views that could not be admired. I hiked fast all day until I got to a nice little camp by a stream where I slept like a baby. The days continued to be cold and windy while I got closer and closer to Damascus. Wednesday the 6th we decided to hike 31 miles from the shelter to a camp spot a mile and a half from Damascus. The wind and cold was still pestering and the day was long and tiring. We made it to the camp spot in eleven hours.
