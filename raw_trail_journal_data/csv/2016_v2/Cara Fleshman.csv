Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516405,"My decision to hike the At came spontaneously after watching A walk in the woods. Previously, I had read numerous books, watched trail logs, and stalked white blaze for a few years always telling myself I was too lazy to attempt a long distance hike. A walk in the woods inspired me because It made it consider being one of those blue blazers, or a section hiker. I do not have half a year or more to dedicate to hiking the full AT. I do, however, have summers. I am graduating from one college this fall, and starting another college this semester that gets me a trade vs a degree in Veterinary tech. I walked out of the movie theater thinking, ""I could do a section hike. A long section hike. I could do it over this summer, and than try for the other sections in the following years. Tax money could fund my trip as well as savings. I need this. I need to do something major in my life that I can brag about in my old age.""and so...I decided to hike from Damascus to Pawlings, Ny. My best friend lives in NYC and can pick me up at the end. Damascus has the wild horses I have always wanted to see. Harper's Ferry is in-between it all where my parents could meet up with me .",,View Entry,"Oct 27, Tue",0

Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516855,"I am now dreaming about the AT. Strange, right? I think it has to do with my constant addictions to information. I have a sort of ocd that comes and goes. I fixate on certain things, learn all I can, and than in a few months...move on. I have done this with animals. I have done this with painting. I even fixated on living in a RV, and decorating/remodeling.Sometimes it is good, other times I regret it since it usually involves spending a lot of money. I don't know if backpacking is another one of my addictions. The sport is not new to me, but the dreaming thing has gotten me a little concerned.The addiction side of me argues over everything while the money conscious side reminds me of my bills. I argue that I don't need to buy my gear this early, and yet the other side of me argues that I should buy a chunk of gear each month so I can fine-tune it in the left over months. I want to buy it now and play with it. I hate waiting for may. Maybe I need to go on a small camping trip in my back yard to try and get some of this out of my system.

Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517299,"The weather is sure turning cold, makes me glad I am not starting my section hike until may. I am not a cold person.
So, I have to take my hiking shoes back. I tried them on at the rei store, liked them, wore than around, came home, and immediately felt like something was wrong. The shoe's felt funny without thick socks. I could feel all the little seams, and the tongue annoyed me.I ignored it however. I figured I would just hike with thick socks and be okay. The first hike in them was on some local hilly trails. I only hiked about a mile or so because we were all feeling pretty lazy. The shoes felt...okay at first...and than they felt pretty good in the end. I figured the more I walk in them, the more I would get use to the sensation of good shoes.I am frugal when it comes to shoes. All of my shoes are flat, poor fitting, etc that I have grown into. I just deal with the pain and it makes my feet stronger. Yet, I know this is not a good technique for hiking.
I wore the shoes again on a longer 4 mile hike with some slippery rocks, steps, hills, etc. It was the deciding factor for me. On my right foot, I felt the sensation of a toe dislocating. It makes my last two toe digits ache. I only feel this in certain shoes and I am not sure what causes the pain. The toes/foot also goes numb because of the sensation. My only theory for the pain (not horrible, but bothersome) is that my second toe closest to the pinky is put under weird pressure because of a too narrow shoe. The toe has a slight claw appearance and when not allowed to spread out..pushes upward instead out as I walk.

Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517504,"What will you be leaving home during your journey?Children, Parents, Pets...Family Events, A soft bed, Showers...I will be leaving adventures with my best friends. I routinely take trips to NYC to visit Judy for concerts, spa trips, explorations of the city. I will also be leaving behind my weekly hiking partner, concert goer, and other best friend, Rebecca. We do so much during the summer time, and I will be missing all of it just to ""walk"" in the woods. Beach trips, Amusement Parks, Concerts, and other events that usually require two to three weeks of work to afford.My parent's will be in charge of babysitting my future, very unhappy dog, simba. He has been my dogie best friend for the past nine years, and hiking partner for many awesome backpacking trips. Unfortunately, age caught up with him, and he had to be retired from anything over 3 miles just this year.I am unsure how he will take me being gone for so long. He is very attached to me. I may have to get my best friend to take him for a hike for me with his dog pal just to keep him from getting too depressed.My other pets will be dispersed over friends and family to keep them happy. My three ferrets will be at a friends place. Cat's will be cared for by my parents. The newest addition, ginger the rabbit, has yet to find a temp home while I am away. When you decide to take these sort of trips, you never really consider what you will be leaving that has become almost a family ritual. A group trip to tangier island with everyone from the family. Weekend drives up to the city for dinner, and a movie. Things that you will miss, Things that make you jealous and home sick.My way of helping me look forward is to remind myself of what I am doing. I will be hiking a trail that is famous for being long and tough. Trail towns will be explored. Traditions along the trail attempted. My own adventure of a life time will be attempted making up for my loss in traditional fun. I also remind myself that there will also be next summer. I need to step out of my comfort zone and do something for myself, completely for myself.

Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517505,"I have received a lot of crap about bringing a dog since I first mentioned the idea. People say it takes away from nature. A dog scares animals away with it's predatory scent. Money is also the next big thing. A dog cost's 2x as much.What they don't say is how a dog keeps you company when you are out there alone. They don't tell you that a dog, while sometimes bothersome, can cheer you up on a long hellish hike by doing something completely goofy. It's been proven that stroking a animal will lower your stress levels. Go in head and try to stroke a bear. See where that will leave you.I choose to bring my hiking dog because I have never not been with a dog. I love the goofy grin they give you when you prepare to start your hike in the morning. I don't care when they get dirty. I don't care that I have to carry extra food and water just for my dog. I don't care that I have to spend some more money for lodging. For me, the trip is just funner with a dog.A little about the dog I will/might be hiking with:Name: LettieAge: Just under a year, too be a year before hike.Breed: Chihuahua + Weener dog = ChiweenieLettie is the coolest little hiker dog I have seen in a while. Even from a young age, she kept up with the larger dogs. Tiny legs never failed her as she ran along side simba during our weekly hike trips. She had stamina that surprises most people.The only reason why I am only 90% sure I will bring her is because she hasn't completely proven herself yet. I want to take her on a three day backpacking trip to test her out before leaving with her for the At. She needs to have a look over by the vet before hand also to check for knee displasia, etc. I leave that 10% open for the last few days of prep when I feel certain she is trail hardy.",,No where,"Nov 17, Tue",0
Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517882,"Hey guys, A few updates and concerns.My hike may or may not change in distance due to some huge events that had opened up on my door step.  - First: My best friend is graduating in July. She said, I quote, ""I will kill you if you do not show up for my graduation."" - Second: My big sister is pregnant! It's almost a miracle since she has a history of problems. She is due around July as well.I think I may cut my hike short just to be able to make it to both events. How does Damascus to Harper Ferry sound? It is still a large distance. I will just have to hike more during the other sections. Harper's - Katadin. Damascus - Springer.This is the reason why my dates are so loose right at this moment. I can't confirm my leave date until I find out my end of spring semester date. I do know I am leaving the beginning of may, end of April with trail days being the latest. Though, I will not be upset if I have to start my hike during trail days. What a awesome beginning, right?Money Wise: I am going to use my tax return to fund the whole trip, and also save along the months to the event. I usually get about $1000+ which is more than enough for my hike + home expenses covered during my time away.On to the Concerns: I have received numerous emails about bringing lettie along my hike. I just wanted to address them in a public manner. Most of the concerns were of bad dog behavior interrupting the hike of others. I would not hike long distance with a dog if I thought they would disrupt other people's hikes. None of my dogs have ever been the run-away type. I have never had issues with dogs chasing wild animals. Lettie is still in training, so her future is questionable. I need to work on snake avoidance, and perfect recall when off leash.  I wish my oldest dog, simba, could of been the one to come with me. He's perfect. He doesn't chase, mane, or follow wild life. He naturally avoids snakes, and lets me know by stopping by the snake. He also has perfect recall.    The best thing about him; He loves to hike even when it hurts him. You see, simba has knee displasia. He can't hike more a few miles before I have to pull him back knowing the further he goes the more pain he will be in tomorrow. In his younger days, he could go twenty plus miles a day before showing signs of being tired. Hell, he out hiked me during my highest moments in life.Despite his pain, and his issues, I still take him hiking every Sunday at the local trails. We always max out at three to four miles, but he is always excited too go.Lettie is a small version of simba. She is excited for each hike. I have taken her as far as seven miles, and she was reering to go still when we stopped. I just can no take her on too many extreme terrain hikes until she is around a year of age (march). This is when he bones stop growing, and I will avoid damaging her growth. I will have a back up plan if she does not work out on the trail. A way for her to get off the trail kind of thing.Anyway, ttylCara",,View Entry,"Nov 18, Wed",0

Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518566,"Hey guys,Guess who's a graduate from college?!?!?! This girl...Woot Woot. I graduated last Thursday with my Associates. I also finally got to figure out some updates for my section hike. The reason why I have been iffy on mileage, dates, etc is because I was unsure if I would have to take spring classes or not. During this semester, I dual enrolled to finish college, and continue with my vet tech degree. My math class, the one I needed to graduate, nearly kicked my ass. I wasn't sure if I was going to pass it, or have to retake it during the spring semester. I also was in a battle to find a internship for my vet tech class for the spring.Fortunately, I did pass my math class, and do not have to take a spring semester at germanna. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a internship for my vet tech school, and can not take spring classes without a internship. So my school is put on hold till august. It opens up my schedule for my section hike. I, for a moment, almost planned to hike from springer to harpers. Than I remembered I don't particular like the cold. :-PMy plan for the next few months pre-hike: Work on finding internship, Shadow a Vet for a few hours, Send in application for another vet tech college to see what happens (Since this one sucks so much), Work as much as possible to save money for hike, continue to refine my gear, and plan my hike.As far as hike information goes, I have officially planned to hike from Damascus to Harper's ferry. My date is May 1st. That way I will be a little ahead of the trail days group.Cheers till the next installment.",,Home,"Dec 20, Sun",0
Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518684,"Hey Guys.Does anyone else feel like the time is going by too fast, your not getting things done fast enough, and than you realize your actually a little early in the planning department?I feel like I am wasting time doing odd ball things and yet it's not even January yet.A few things to address; My reasoning to bring Lettie is starting to lean towards the ""no"" side. I am about 30%. Yes, 70% no. The reason? The logistics of being in town, not the actual hiking. Every time I take her out, she is great. She is a fast learner. For being such a small dog, she has a lot of stamina to keep up with the big dogs. Right now, I am walking about 3 miles a day, rain or shine, with one day off a week. It is not much, but it is the type of constant walking experience she needs for me to further pin point if I will bring her or not.Plus; someone said I would be carrying her most of the time, that's the point of a small dog. I am balancing out stamina vs mobility.The reason why I am leaning more towards not bringing her is because of my last trip to nyc. She went on subways, dog parks,'walks along concert side walks with a highway full of cars speeding by. While she did do good, I found that she almost curled into herself from being so overwhelmed with people. Lettie is a nature dog. People? She shies away from anyone she doesn't know. Dogs? She gives them a wide birth. Nothing aggressive, but all things that aren't perfect. Meanwhile, she will sell her soul to the devil to be with you once she trusts a person. She is a character all in herself.I am unsure how she would react to being tied to my pack and left at a food lion door step while I went in to gather food.So while she is one bad ass hiker on the trail, the logistics of being in towns makes me hesitate on bringing her. We shall see! Maybe with all this warm weather, I will take a longer walk to the grocery store and see how she reacts to bring tied to a pack/pole/etc. The photo at the top of the entry is from our recent hike. She snapped her collar break away system a handful of times, and Came back once called like a champ even during one moment when she started to run circles around us.The big dog is my boy, simba. He is the type of dog everyone loves. He use to hike miles upon miles with me in his younger days. The energy in that dog is amazing even today with his knees being so messed up. I had to retire him this spring to a meager three mile tops per hike. He has knee displasia that cripples him when off medication. I wish he was healthy. He would be the dog to make the AT.

Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520106,"Hey Everybody.Things have been busy so far this January. I am nearly done with getting my gear ready. There are only a few odd pieces that need to be added, or worked on left. My base weight is hovering around 10 lbs but is going to grow one or two pounds with the left over item decisions. Still, 10-12 pounds as a base weight isn't so bad. I can probably get even lower in full summer by replacing my bag with a silk liner.I will post a chart of my gear for those that are interested in what I am bringing on hike.------On other news, we got hit head on with this snow storm. I believe the total snow is just under two feet. The snow drifts are ridiculously high. Friday evening, my father and I had to go out and get the snow off the top of our canvas car ports. The car ports cover my fathers classic car collection and can not support a lot of snow. We had to lift the roof sections from the inside until the snow fell off ether side.Saturday evening, despite clearing the roofs of snow the day before, we lost one car port. In order to rebuild it/damage check, we have to wait for the snow to melt. The other eight car ports are all leaning due to the heavy snow piling to each side of the port. One drift is about five feet high before we cleared the roof a second time. I had to go along the sides and try to clear the snow drifts to lessen the stress to the car ports.My boat is okay. I choose to sleep in the house the last few days due to the snow. It was up to my knees Saturday morning when I was busy clearing a path to the boat on the dock. Fun!!! Not. I nearly fell off and ended up catching myself on my little Buddha statue that was hidden in the snow. I thanked him for saving me from one cold dip in the Potomac river.I was doing a decent exercise routine until the snow to help work on body weight. I gained twenty pounds over Christmas and can't seem to shake some new bad habits. Work doesn't help. I have a habit of getting something sweet along side my nightly coffee before work. Not only is it a diet bummer, it doesn't help that it is expensive. One Coffee: $1.40.A Sweet Treat: $2.00Now multiply that by four times per week. I work for tips and right now tips are crap. My paycheck was even worse than December despite working more hours.I am waiting for my tax forms from work to come in so I can see what I will have to put towards my hike. Last year, I ended up with over a thousand. I am hoping I will close to that amount so I can have a nice little cushion for my hike on top of savings from work.Savings...Ha. I know once I get done with gear picks I will be able to put money away. Right now I am just barely paying the bills and work on gear before I am near broke until the next pay check.But it is all good! I picked up some extra days at work, and am going to see about closing shifts for even more hours. I have too since I have a hand full of trips coming up. My best freind is coming down from NYC next week and we plan to take the train into dc for some site seeing. In April, I am going to the Mahaa spring hang in pa. Nether trips are expensive, but I need to save money for before my trip and afterward. My work will take me back when I go back, but I don't want to start again broke encase something happens.On top of everything! Four cats need rabies shots by February. It won't be expensive...40-50 bucks total...just unexpected.ToodlesCara",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Sat",0
Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520843,"Back when I first wrote in this journal, I made a page describing why I wanted to hike the trail. My meaning was simple, I needed to challenge myself beyond my usual standards. The meanings of my need to hike have grown since the starting of this journal, and my process of pre-pairing for my hike.As it stands...Last fall, I graduated college after three years with a associates degree in general studies. The feat was nothing big according to the amount of studies is provided. Just about anyone can graduate college with some sort of degree, and I was just another fish in the sea with a college education.My plans for after college was to continue my education in a Vet Tech field. I have one fourth of the degree done, but need to secure a spot at as a intern at a vet office. My plans to get a spot before this spring fell through when no one I called, visited, and interviewed had a spot for a vet tech student.With much frustration, and anger, I had to skip this spring semester of college because I can not continue without a placement for the program. I hate missing college. It makes me feel like a failure in life when I am just trying to get a foot hold in it. My age matters to me; I am 25 going on 26. I do not want to be that thirty year old still trying to get a good bill paying job.On the other spectrum, I find myself in a pickle. I want to help animals, and I always did have a compassion for their well-being. However, the vets that I have shadowed behind in my process to try and get a foot in the door seemed to only focus on money. Everything. The tech's were harsh. Animals were just animals.This felt wrong. I was the only one there that was eager to see the next patient. It was just a job for them. I already have a ""just another job"". After coming home, and letting everything sink in, I considered maybe the vet tech thing was the wrong position. Yet, I feel lost at what else to do. I could become a biologist and try to work at a zoo. My college grades and GPA are crap. No four year would accept me. I barely passed my first college.So my options are limited. The easier option would be to keep trying to get into the vet tech thing, and hope to get hired by a office that isn't just a money making machine. Animal's shouldn't be treated that way. In my eyes, we are all animals. Some are just smarter than others. I have spent the last month soul searching, and trying not to feel sorry for myself. I keep going over different careers, different needs, and just over all wants that might trigger that deep drive to do a certain thing. Because of this vet tech issue, I feel unsure about everything I do. Do I want to just become a vet tech? Or, a biologist? Maybe, a social worker like my best freind. I always loved English; maybe a English major of some sort. Urgh...The hike offers a escape from outside influences that might harbor my soul searching. While it may seem like I am escaping, I am simply trying to put myself in a position where I have to spend time by myself. I have to trust my body, my mind, my skills. The mental aspect of a long distance hike intrigues me to want to hike even if it means missing out of family events, friendly gatherings, etc. I need to pause and think instead of just swapping majors for the next thing. This hike is the only thing that I know could be the answer to my issues. Which is why my hike has no ending point..or at least many possible points. I may stop at harpers ferry, or maybe pawlings NY. Perhaps even Katadin if I feel driven by the environment around me.I would be missing a lot this summer. Friends, Family, Pets. My sister is having a baby in July. Everyone around me is planning all these summer events. sure, I could not hike and just keep working to go on these events. Nothing, however, would give me the same mental aspect as the ""hike"".So...that is my reason too hike.",,Home,"Feb 07, Sun",0

I have firmly decided to hike up to pawlings, new York as my lowest spot to stop. Pawlings was my original ending location due to my best freind living in nyc. A lot of planning, thoughts, and time has passed since I first planned this trip. I almost forgot about my initial ending point. It feels ""right"". If I hike up to pawlings and consider hiking further, I will obviously push forward to katadin. It also depends on funds.Another thing: I have decided that I will probably not go to college in the fall. I have no idea what I want to do so there is obviously no point in me starting something that I don't know yet.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Sun",0

Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523255,"Strange how things change during the planning phase of a LD Hike. Originally, I was going to graduate in the fall, and continue my Vet Tech degree along the spring time. My hike would of been during the summer with my ending around pawlings, ny being the time I would have to return home for the fall semester. Now?I didn't get to go to classes this spring because I could not find a intern spot for my college. In order to continue classes for my program, I would of needed to find a position as a potential vet tech. I spent months calling, chasing emails/phones, shadowing, and a few interviews only for things to come to a stand still. I have all but given up in continuing my program due to my frustration over the ordeal. In the end, I started to question whether I even wanted to be a vet tech when everything seemed to detour me from the path for so long. Was this my real goal in life? I love working with animals, but I hated how money driven everything was about the position.So..My hike changed. I went from hiking for the experience to hiking to learn about myself. Some things have changed. I was accepted in to a college in VA Beach. It doesn't really have a degree that I am extremely interested in, but it does have things that interest me. I also have scholarships up the A$$ at this college that make the tuition pretty enticing. It would require me to change jobs, and move which is a big ordeal short notice right off the bat from a LD Hike.I am not sure what I want to do. Maybe, I will let the trail tell me, or maybe the trail is just the platform for my brain to start just listening to itself and not the influences around it.",,View Entry,"Mar 12, Sat",0
Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526733,"Hey guys!I am still here, don't worry. I just sorta fell off the wagon for a moment there when it came to posting. I also sucked at fitness. While I have done a few day hikes, one short 3 miles backpacking trip, I haven't really done much in regards to exercise. And don't let me start on my eating habits!Anyway, I am leaving the second Friday in May for Damascus. My mother and sister volunteered to drive me down. Woot! I have all my gear save for a few loose ends. Other than that, nothing's been happening. I am just waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, and more waiting. While I work...work....work...and more work. On the plus side, may is busy for me. I have a day trip to dc this Sunday to paint the cherry blossoms. The next weekend is the annual group hang in pa with my best friend. The weekend after that, my sisters baby shower. And than I leave!So I have a few weeks to get on the band wagon with exercises, eating, and my yoga.",,fell off the wagon,"Apr 06, Wed",0
Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527520,"http://www.hikingupward.com/SNP/WhiteOakCedarRun/This post is going to be backward since I am posting nearly a week after my next discussion!Last weekend was pretty chaotic. I fell ill mid-week with what I thought was just a really bad case of the allergies. Upon plenty of medication later, I realized I was sick. I ended up taking off Thursday (thought I had really bad allergies so I took a crap load of medication), worked a miserable Friday (too which I do not remember because of said medication dosages), and took off Saturday.Than I went hiking Sunday! Just because I had a serve sinus infection, heavy cough, and head ache, I wasn't going to miss my day hike with my best friends. This was the last hike with them before I leave in may. At this point, I was actually ""better"" than say Friday but not 100% better.The hike went well...I only half died.No seriously. While hiking cleared my sinuses right the heck up, I felt so weak on the entire hike. I am sure it was only because of the sinus infection and being unable to really heal from the whole mess of sickness. Monday? I could barely walk. I apparently over used the top muscles in my thighs on the descending steps along the cedar run section of that trail. But At least I could breath!!!I did enjoy my hike. I feel ready and strong. I think the thigh overuse was a fluke since I had never had such a pain before in my life, and I was still a recovering medication Addict for the week I was Ill. My feet did not hurt at all during the hike, or afterward which is in my mind a plus over every other hike I have done in the past. I always seem to have foot pain. Leg pain was a new thing to me.My next hike will be next weekend I hope. Maybe. I want to attempt emerald pond again since it was the hike that kicked my royal arse the last time I hiked it. Trust me. STEEP incline in sandles right in the middle of bug season equals a very sore, upset me. I had not been ready when I attempted this hike last year.Check it out, and look at the little map with incline to see what I mean about steepness: http://www.hikingupward.com/GWNF/EmeraldPond/",,Pre-Hike White Oak Canyon.,"Apr 11, Mon",0

Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528659,"Hey guys,Apparently my mother found my journal, HI Mom!Okay, so I had off sunday-monday and wanted to do something to help stretch my legs. I had been cooped in the house for far too long. So, I woke up early sunday morning, and drove out to a trail that had previously kicked my sorry but.The story behind emerald pond: I hiked up the trail with a pack that must of weighed over 30lbs. It was full summer, hot, humid, and I was feeling it. I also wore sandals for my hike. Well, I get to the top after a hellish climb. I had just sat my pack down to take a breather, and relax when a atv comes up the road that I would be heading next. It was a park ranger, whom proceeded to tell me that they were closing the trail due to aggressive bear activity.I had just flippin climbed the mountain, and couldn't even get a break before having to go back down. Darn it!So back down the mountain I go, and in to my car I drive. My feet felt like someone was stabbing me with a red hot poker. My knees ached from the decent. I was muddy, stinky, and declined a cool dip in to a pond.This time around, I had a different sort of ending: I hiked, and conquered that mountain. I tamed that wild beast all in one day wearing a full pack on fully expecting me to want to stop for the night before the pond.Nope. I kept going when I saw I had plenty of light left. Muwahahaha. I ended up doing the full 8 miles with a pack on at a very brisk mock 5 hiking speed. It was pretty exhilarating. I felt awesome.Best part about the hike, I felt great the day after as well. Hardly any pain from the crazy accent/decent save for just stiff muscles that needed stretching in the morning.Another awesome note: Lettie may be back on for the trip. She kept up with me on this hike, and seemed to prove her place along the trail. We got a few up beat comments on how little she was while also keeping up with my head long pace. I put speed walkers to shame. We did close to 4 miles in little more than an hour.",,Pre-Hike: Feeling Strong!,"Apr 19, Tue",0
Cara Fleshman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529919,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_h4CpX4Jr4This weekend was fun! I asked off work Friday-Monday in order to kinda of relax and learn more about hammocks. While I can't say that I learned more, I did relax, eat, spend time with Friends, and just in general have fun. I did learn that I need to cut back on coffee. One day without my usual pm cup of joe and I can't think, talk, or walk straight. I also did not know that I gained weight until watching a video of myself walking around. Two or so week left before I leave! Time to wean myself off coffee.",,Mahha Spring Hammock Hang,"Apr 26, Tue",0
