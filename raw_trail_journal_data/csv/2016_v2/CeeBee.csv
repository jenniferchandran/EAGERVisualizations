CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520214,"I am walking the AT with my friend Ellie, Hummingbird in 2017. We will celebrate our 64th birthdays in August on the trail.Backpacking is totally new to me but I am lucky because Ellie walked a good chunk of the trail in 2014 and has been able to answer all the questions a novice has. She took a bad fall and had to leave the trail, but the trail never left her. When she started talking about going back I knew I had to go with her. I am looking forward to this new adventure.",,The Beginning,"Jan 26, Tue",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520217,"I have a lot to learn. I've been reading books, and trail journals to glean information where I can. Ellie has been very helpful answering endless questions like what kind of sleeping bag, what will I eat, should I get a stove, how heavy is too heavy.But there has been one thing at the forefront, I have had a life-long paralyzing fear of snakes. National Geographic magazines were a favorite but I had to be cautious. I would carefully peel back a page and peek to see if there was a snake on the page. You can imagine it took awhile to get through the magazine the first time. If there was a snake my heart rate jumped and the magazine went flying across the room.So obviously this is something I have to work on. Ever since Ellie mentioned the AT and I invited myself on her hike, I have had a mind change. I am now able to look at snakes in a book and even watch them on TV. I have more work to do but I am so happy to have made some progress. My goal for the future is to visit the St Louis Zoo reptile house. I need to be able to identify the snakes I see.I'm told snakes want to get out of the way as much as I want them out of the way. My plan is to give them a wide berth and walk on. I'm sure the heart rate will be elevated but I'm determined to overcome this fear and enjoy the trail.",,Fears,"Jan 26, Tue",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520221,"Because I am new to backpacking I have to buy everything. Thank goodness I have some time to get things organized. I did get my tent for Christmas, a Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 Mtn Glo. I love the lights, they are nice and soft so won't be blinding people at night. I have ordered an Enlightened Equipment quilt, a beautiful yellow and pink! I am a restless sleeper so the quilt sounded like the best for me. I ordered and have sent back one air pad, the next one is on its way from REI. The first one was way too long, I am 5'7"" and just didn't need the 78"" model. I have been told that the air pads can be noisy so I have been reading reviews hoping to find a quiet one. I ordered an ExPed SynMat Hyperlite so hopefully that will be OK.The backpack is a total mystery to me. We have a small outdoor store here in Columbia MO so tried on two packs but neither one was comfortable. Will have to make a trip to KC or St Louis REI to try on different brands. I have been collecting other pieces of equipment, Jetboil MiniMo, a leatherman tool, darn tough socks, and wool undies. There are so many little things to add to the pack. Ellie keeps me mindful of pack weight. So any and all comments on gear selection would be helpful.",,Gear Gear Gear,"Jan 26, Tue",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520251,I've been trying to find my trail name. Nothing seemed to feel right. I decided to go with my initials. So this might change but I should be able to remember who I am at the end of a long hiking day.,,Whats in a name,"Jan 26, Tue",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523544,"Today was a big day for me. It was the first day to hike with a pack. It was only 7 lbs. and only 3 miles but it is a start. My husband, Rod, and I found a trail in town with a nice hill to practice on. Last week we did an 8 mile day with no problems. I have been walking 3-5 miles most days and will continue to do so. My walks are usually on the treadmill so it has been nice being outside and enjoying the great weather. I want to thank Rod for all his support and walking with me. I have been reading the class of 2016 trail journals. There is so much to learn from them. I am filling notebooks with all kinds of great tips. Best of luck to all of you.",,Big Day,"Mar 14, Mon",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525290,"My calendar count down says 365 days to go. I'm hoping this year will fly by. I have so much to do and so much to learn. Hummingbird Ellie is coming to Missouri next month so we can hike together and get to know our gear a little better.I have made decisions on the big three. I have the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 tent, an Enlightened Equipment 30 degree quilt, and just a couple of days ago my pack arrived, a Zpack Arc Haul Zip. Wore it today on a short 3.5 mile hike with 13 lbs. I am very happy with it. Now will have to decide on clothes. There are so many choices and so many variables with the weather. I have appreciated all the advise given and enjoy reading the journals. I'll be paying more attention to those leaving in the next couple of days, so I can get an idea of their weather conditions.To the class of 2017, our time will get here and to those out on the trail all the best. Be safe.   ",,365,"Mar 29, Tue",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543128,"I have been wanting to sit down and write in this journal for a long time, writing is not really my thing but I want a record of our journey. Ellie, Hummingbird, and I will be on the trail in 250 days! I have most of my gear and have been walking and trying to find hills to climb here in Columbia. Not much walking going on the last couple of weeks it is just too hot. I really feel for those out on the trail now with the heat we have had this year.I am second guessing on some of my choices of equipment. Ellie tells me this is normal and not to worry about it too much. The one big thing I am thinking over is my choice in tent. I have the BA Copper Spur 2, but ordered a Zpack duplex with flex tent poles. The Zpack arrived in the mail this week and my first reaction was you can see through it. I am trying to decide if I want to keep this one or send it back and try the camo version. But then I can also just go back to the Copper Spur. If you have either one would like to hear your opinion on why one would be better than the other.My husband has agreed to take me to Springer Mountain and walk the approach trail then on to Neals Gap in Sept. We will plan on about 8 miles a day and see how we do. This will give me an idea of what I am getting into and how much harder I need to prepare physically. All the journals and Ellie have said that the only way to prepare for the trail is to walk the trail. It will also be a good opportunity to check out gear and see what works and what doesn't.I have enjoyed reading journals, it is a daily pleasure. You start feeling like you know these people, I can't wait to be out there myself. All the best to those on the trail stay safe and enjoy the journey.",,250 Days to go,"Jul 22, Fri",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549571,"Last week we started my first shakedown hike. My husband Rod, Willow and her husband Carl met in Dahlonega at the Hiker Hostel. We spent 2 nights there and had a great time. Willow and Carl stayed in one of the private rooms in the main house, Rod and I stayed in one of the container rooms. If you get a chance to stay there I highly recommend it. Very clean and the breakfast is great.On the 20th we started up the trail to the Len Foote Hike Inn. We left above the falls so didn't do the steps. It was a 4.6 mile hike and was great. We all enjoyed the Hike Inn. Bill our host was very entertaining and gave us a history of the Inn and a program after dinner about Southern Utah and the Grand Canyon area. The dinner and breakfast at the Inn was very good.On the 21st we hiked out to the approach trail and on to Springer Mountain. I'm not sure what I was expecting but we got pictures and set out for Stover Creek. Springer has unreliable water this year so we had to hike to the water. We set up camp at Stover Creek and settled down for the night. The art of setting up camp and taking down in the morning is something that has to be learned. It took us more time to do both chores, so I'm hoping after time and repetition it will become faster. Some of the firsts, first night in the tent, first time to use the Jetboil, first time pooping in the woods, first time with 30 lbs in pack, first fall, first time filtering water, first time using the headlamp, but the really big first was the first white blaze. Most firsts were successful others not. The next day we hiked to Hawk Mountain Shelter. We thought that we might stay at Hawk Mountain Campground but decided to do the .7 mile to the Shelter. The campground has a 2300' down to the water. At the turnoff to the Shelter Rod and I misread the sign and continued down the trail. After about 1/4 mile I pulled out Guthook and realized we had missed it, I hollered at Rod we need to turn around but he thought he could find another way, long story short, I turned around and then we waited for a couple of hours for Rod to retrace his steps. Overall he walked a couple of extra hard miles.By Thursday I started having problems eating. I was so excited about trying some of the hiker foods I had read about in TJ, but my stomach just wanted something very bland. When I start next year I will have instant soup and jello to start out with. My body was rebelling and it was time to get off the mountain. We made it to Cooper Gap and then called the Hiker Hostel for rescue. They were very kind to rearrange things in their day to come and get us.I have learned so many things from this short hike. Pack weight cannot be stressed enough. My boots and pack are great! Food can be an issue. There are lots of bugs and spiders but not many birds on the trail. I can't imagine how bad the rocks are in Penn, the rocks and roots in GA are pretty bad. I will be doing about 1 mile an hour to start. I need to lose some weight. This hike will be physically hard, but I can do it. We missed Hummingbird. She has the experience and would have known what to do when we were scratching our heads and wondering what was the right thing to do. I guess there are just some things you have to learn on your own. I have to thank my husband for all his support and encouragement. He never once complained and is already planning the trip back to GA in March. I can't wait.",,Lots of firsts,"Sep 26, Mon",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551528,"Hummingbird Ellie has decided to hike in 2018 so I will be doing my hike solo. I'm sure that I will meet people on the trail but it will be a different hike for me. I was relying on Ellie for her experience on the trail and now I have to make all decisions on my own. I'm thinking that is a good thing. First change, I'll be leaving 18 March. I want to give myself plenty of time to go slow and enjoy the experience.I've been ""plotting"" my course through Georgia. My husband will stay in the area for the first 10 days so I will have an opportunity to make sure that my pack has what it needs and I am doing OK. I will have a couple of opportunities for slack-packing and also figuring out what to eat on the trail.I have slept in my tent in the backyard a couple of cooler nights to see how efficient my quilt was. I needed a warmer quilt so have ordered a Zpack 10 degree quilt. It will be here tomorrow, just in time for some 20 degree weather. I would much rather plan for the worst and then be surprised by the good weather we will have next year, wishful thinking on my part.I'm still working on my clothes. I understand the layering idea, just not sure how to pull it off. We have had 70-80 degree weather this week, but tomorrow it will be in the 40's for a high. I'm hoping to test my layering in the cooler weather on my walks around Columbia.Another concern is the fire raging in GA and NC. Just to be on the safe side I will also plot a course from Harpers Ferry in case a flip-flop would be better for next year. So many decisions to be made, but I still have some time to decide.",,So many changes,"Nov 17, Thu",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553216,"The time is rolling down. I'm excited, anxious, scared, haven't slept much but can't wait for this adventure to start. We are having the typical Missouri winter weather, snow one day, high wind the next, 69 degrees and the next day a high of 33, I have been walking in all of it. I am wearing my pack with about 20lbs of weight, so hoping that by the time I get on the trail I won't embarrass myself.I love my backpack and boots. I think I have a good handle on the winter layers and will be taking my stove so I can have hot chocolate in the AM. I'll probably send the stove home after it warms up. I'm hoping to have my pack in the 26-28lb range for the winter and 25lbs for the summer. So things are progressing. It looks like I will be starting out by myself but will be joined by Willow around the end of March. Rod and I have reservations at Amicalola Falls for 2 nights and then Rod will move on to one of the cabins at Blood Mountain for the next week. He will then have a couple of days in Helen before he returns to MO. By that time I should have a good idea of what I'll keep in my pack and send the rest home with him.All the best to everyone hiking this year, I hope to meet as many of you as possible.",,64 Days to go,"Jan 12, Thu",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553847,"I know I'm not a thru hiker yet. The other day as I was walking up my little practice hill I saw 3 quarters, I bent over, picked them up and put them in my pocket. Then I was eating my favorite Caveman bar, the one with coconut, and dropped it. I picked it up, rubbed off the dirt and...put it in my garbage bag. I am doing what I can to prepare for this hike. There is a trail nearby that I walk frequently. Today I stopped at the top of the hill and sat on the bench to rest. I realized that it was 30° and snowing but I was comfortable, warm and very happy to be out. I walked 8.5 miles today with 18lbs in my pack. The terrain is very easy here in Columbia so I know I will have my work cut out for me when I get to GA.When can you call yourself a thru hiker? Only after you have finished your hike from GA to ME? I'm thinking that when you leave your quarters on the window sill of the convenience store because they are too heavy to carry and you pick up that Caveman bar and eat it dirt and all, that you might be able to start calling yourself a thru hiker.50 days before I start.",,Not a thru hiker yet,"Jan 26, Thu",0
CeeBee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556666,"Today my countdown clock said 1 day! We left Columbia after noon, had a dental appointment, and drove to Clarksville TN. Hoping to get to Amicalola around 1 tomorrow. That will give me plenty of time to walk the stairs. Then on Saturday I'll start the trail. I'm so excited, but also scared. I know there will be plenty of people on the trail so I shouldn't worry. My pack is in the 26lb range, I'll weigh it at check-in and get the official weight. I'm figuring to just take it slow and steady. These first couple of weeks I'm planning on 8 mile days. I might slackpack from Woody Gap to Neel Gap but will make that decision on the day. I'm so thankful that my husband is willing to sit around for a couple of weeks while I get my pack dialed in and a handle on everything. I am a very lucky woman to have this man in my life. We will celebrate our 45 wedding anniversary in September. Where does the time go. Our daughter is home with our sick cat and handling everything so we don't have to worry about things. Thank you Sally I love you very much. I'm having a hard time realizing the time is here. I will miss Hummingbird Ellie. I wish she was going but I have named my pack Hummer, Rod says that way I will always have a friend with me. Ellie I know you will be following, but I still miss you.",,Almost there,"Mar 16, Thu",0
