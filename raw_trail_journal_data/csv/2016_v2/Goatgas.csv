Goatgas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521740,"I arrived on the 22 of February at Amicalola Lodge with plans to start on the 24th. This will give me time to do the approach trail and dreaded stairs at the falls, and make any last minute adjustments. Its reasonably warm(50ish) but bad weather is expected. How bad is unknown at the moment. so wed is still the plan.","Amicalola approach trail

Goatgas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521759,"walked the approach trail/stairs in the park to get that out of the way while waiting for bad weather that's approaching. I was worried my left knee would give me a problem having wrenched it last month while hiking on a trail that feral hogs had tore up, I was happy to complete that ""test"" with no problems. I'm warm and safe at the lodge and look forward to tomorrow morning to start my hike even though its now lightly snowing. next stop springer mountain.","Amicalola park
