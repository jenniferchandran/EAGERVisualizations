Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517957,"WOW! My first journal entry. I have been waiting 12 years for this moment. The kids are off to college. I am retired and my wife has given me the GO. After reading hundreds of journals, dozens of books and watching about every dvd or youtube video out there the time has come to get out and hike the trail.First I would like to thank Leif and everyone at trail journals. Without this site being available I'm not sure this hike would have happened. Thousands of hours living thru all the hikers who have attempted the Appalachian Trail has inspired me to do the same. While I hope this journal is entertaining, informative, and exciting my main goal will be to keep an accurate account of my adventures. I will keep a daily account of my expenses and once a week devote a paragraph to tips from the trail. It would be an honor to have hikers look back and someday say that they learned a lot from my postings. Waiting for April 1st",,Springer Mt.,"Dec 01, Tue",0
Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517960,Just for the record. The longest hike I've ever done is 6 miles with a 12 pound pack. Started to do some 3 mile training hikes. Not sure how everybody does 15-20 miles a day. This should be interesting! Have a few friends betting against a successful thru-hike. I'll take on all bets. This is the start of my gear. YOU can click on any of the pictures of the day and they will become full page.,,Springer Mt.,"Dec 03, Thu",0
Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518552,"OK. I'm still getting my gear togeather and I am not going to bore you with a lenghtly pack list. You will be able to view everything that's in my pack if you click to gear list. I'm starting to understand why it seems everybody waits until the last minute. THEY DON'T! It takes so much planning, shopping, comparing, but it will all be worth it if you have the right gear.   My thoughts on the three most important factors to a successful thru-hike are (1)Packweight. (2)Packweight (3)Packweight. Some hikers might say mental toughness, get in shape, attitude. Guess what! That all falls into place if you can shave 20 lbs off your back for the 2180 mile trip. Shooting for a 15 lb pack and 7-10 lbs of food.   I will never forget my first encounter with a thru hiker. It was years before I realized what I saw.. I was doing an easy 3 mile hike when this person approached me with a huge pack. His socks were hanging off his hiking poles and he smelled really bad. I laughed as he passed by me thinking, who does this guy think he is. Crazy dude is only a mile from the road. He doesn't need all that stuff. (Ya, my first thru). When I realized what I saw, the idea of hiking a trail that goes on forever stayed in my head for the next 15 years.    So now at 55 years old I'm going to quote the movie Shawshank Redemption.

My concerns of freezing to death in the smokies are all coming back to me. Lyme disease and cold weather are my 2 biggest fears. I will be treating my clothes with permethrin after the first month to fend off the nastys on the trail and I'm spending a little extra on the right clothing.    When I asked a thru-hiker this summer what was the hardest part of the trek he told me it was his wife calling every week with a different problem at home (lawn mower won't start, water leak, broken dryer, etc.) So I'm setting up a list of everybody for my wife to call in case of a problem and a second number for back-up.                     3 things to avoid on the trail    No slackpacking (hiking without a full pack)    No sleeping in shelters (tent, hostel, motel to avoid norovirus)    Quitting (its not an option)                      3 things to do on the trail    Hike every mile from GA-ME       Have a really great time throughout my journey    Return a happier and better person (if that's possible, ha ha)My next post will be Feburary 1.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521181,"The last month has flown by. Disney, Mexico, Belize, and Honduras. I need a vacation from the vacations. It is time to get in shape for this hike! For the readers who are not quite familiar with the trail I have a few numbers and some information for you. Here we go.    5,000,000 steps from Georgia to Maine.    2180 miles long    260 shelters along the way    14 states of hiking    After consulting with the expert (my wife, 30 years with the Post Office) I have decided to not send any mail drops to myself. Not only is it not cost effective but the countless stories from hikers of getting sick of the food they prepared or waiting in town an extra day for their package to arrive is enough to persuade me to pick up my food every 2-3 days along the trail. For the record, no one has ever starved to death Thru-Hiking the Appalachian Trail. There might be one large package with a new resupply of gear, clothes, and whatever else breaks down along the way. Hopefully this package won't be needed until the halfway point at Harpers Ferry.    I'm hoping lots of friends will sign the guest book on the left column of this site. It is very easy and a few words of encouragement can go a long way when you are away from home for this long. Whenever possible I will try to post twice daily. Once around noon during a break and then again before bed. Have heard that it is sometimes difficult to type a lengthy journal at night due to exhaustion.    My next post will be at the end of March.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524360,It is crunch time. Still have a few items to buy. Starting to stress out and I usually don't stress about anything. Did a shakedown hike in the woods last week and learned a few things. My can stove does not have enough ventilation in the side so the flame get's smothered out when I put my cup on it. Always check the batteries in your head lamp. Also need a small pad under my boney butt when I sleep.    My training has been going well. No matter what tasks I have for the day 2+ hours have been put aside for hiking. Am up to 7 miles a day with a full pack. Usually hiking 3 consecutive days before taking a zero seems to be working. Don't want to over train before the trip.    The above picture was taken two years ago at Chet's hostel in Lincoln NH. I made the 80 mile drive to do some trail magic and pick the brains of as many thru-hikers as I could. Chet's an awesome guy who fills his garage every season with thrus. A small donation or a brief work for stay is more than enough for this very generous man. Chet is not in any hiking books and goes by word of mouth only. Right in the center of this small White Mountain town you have easy access to EVERYTHING u need. He has become a friend and I can't wait to see him when hiking thru NH this year.  Just another day dreaming of the Appalachian Trail! Hearing of hikers starting with way too much food.

Our train broke down so we had to transfer. At the next stop the police stopped the train for an assault. Then When we finally arrived at the hiker hostel I realized I did not bring my credit card with me. Oh ya, also left a pair of readers on the plane. Got to stay focused, just too excited. Guess who got the fire started tonight right after the downpour. TERODACTYLE!Met a great bunch of hikers tonight. The owners states that the numbers are up 40% from last year.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525896,Woke up to a great breakfast. Met so many interesting people last night. Everybody arrived on Springer around 10am. No rain but very foggy. Unfortunately I arrived without my hiking poles. Left them in the van and realized it as they were driving off. Thank God for cell phones. They are going to meet me tomorrow at a road crossing. This is the biggest rookie mistake out here during the first week.    Ran into my first trail magic around 2 this afternoon. Plenty of tasty snacks. I am carrying 1.5 days of food. Everybody seems jealous of my pack. Had the lowest packweight out of the 24 hikers today. 22 lbs with food and water!!

They have wifi.    I now know first hand about hiking out of a gap. After packing up the tent there was a 700ft stright up hike. Had to peel off a few layers. Met these 3 guys from Mass. And hiked with them for a few miles before they left me in the dust.    This afternoon met a guy from Hawaii. A marine biologist. Learned a lot,and was so interesting.

It was delish. Soon after 8 of us boarded the free shuttle back to the trail. We ended up right back at the trail magic bus. A second breakfast in one hour. Speaking of food, there has been so much food in the hiker boxes u could have had almost carried nothing the first 3 days. Am at blood Mt. Shelter right now. It's Awesome.    Just did another 3.5mi to Neels gap. This place is beautiful. Still can't believe I am here. I've seen this place so many times in videos and books. Trying to cook for the first time with my can stove. Scored big time in the hiker box at Woody gap. Hiker boxes are at every hostel full of discarded food items and other trail items.

The 10 or 11 mile days seem to be working pretty good for the first week. I plan on increasing mileage in a few more days. Was having trouble with my homemade stove. Negotiator @ Mustard seed had an extra pocket rocket stove with too much fuel. So I am the proud owner of a new stove. They would not take a penny for this $35 new stove. Such nice people. My can stove went right into the trash.    Was the first one up but the last one out of the hostel this morning. Had some decent scrambled eggs and bacon complements of the free hikers box. They weren't bad but would not pay 9 dollars for these pre-dried food packages. Toughest day yet of hiking. A lot of straight up @ downs, thru 2 wilderness areas.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526501,"Just want to say thank you everybody for signing the guest book. I finally got a chance to check it last night and it really meant a lot to me. It was a long day of hiking and 95% of it was alone. So nice to know so many people back home are pulling for you. A lot of the hikers out here are not as lucky.    Cold Cold Cold last night. I did not wear enough cloths to bed so after 3am the tent was pretty frosty.Heading for the top of Georgia hostel a.m. Will be checking in tonight.    After packing up a cold wet tent Seadog and I we're on our way. Looks like I'll have some company on today's hike. The first 3 miles this morning flew by. The terrain was mostly flat with soft sand, a nice break. The miles seem to go by so much quicker when you have somebody with you. After stopping for lunch we proceeded to do the last four miles in about 1 hour anticipating getting to the newest and supposedly nicest hostel on the trail. I got to the parking lot around 1 o'clock and called the shuttle to pick me up. There was two different people set up with Trail Magic. The picture you see above is two newly retired firefighters who are also dreaming of doing the trail soon. The 10 miles covered today seem twice as easy as yesterday and I have decided tomorrow to bump up the mileage to about 12 to 14 miles a day. Once settled in the hostel 4 of us got a free shuttle to town and did resupply for the next three days. It's official, I'm a thru hiker going through the grocery store trying to find food that will last me for 3 days with no refrigerator or microwave. It's harder than I thought. We had a 2hr time limit in town and decided to go to an all-you-can-eat buffet. We were then going to go across the street for a beer or two. We were all so full from the buffet, there was no room for beer. What is happening to me?? No beer, too full of food!!

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526628,"It was nice and warm in the hostel but got very little sleep. In 27yrs bunking with up to 12 firemen a night I have never heard such snoring in my whole life. There was a large man handing out ear plugs which was a nice gesture but it only helped a little. In the morning he asked everybody if they slept well. Nobody was saying anything so as usual I ended up saying what everyone wanted to.. "" Thank u for the plugs but it sounded like you were getting murdered last night""  Grunting, snorting, talking, coughing and very load snoring. The next 3 nights will be in the woods. As soon as I get through the Smokey Mountain National Forest and it warms up there will be no more hostels unless heavy rain is in the forecast. Hope I have enough food for the 40mi trek!        Today's hike out of town was once again straight up for the first mile. This will probably be the norm for the rest of the hike. After mile one I stopped at a small brook and the boots and socks came off to dunk my feet for break. At first the other hikers thought I was crazy but I have convinced a few to do the same and they are raving. You literally float for the following mile your feet feel so good. The geography mimics that of New Hampshire. Rocks, roots, steep climbs and beautiful views. Georgia is surprisingly nice.    After covering my face and neck with sunscreen this morning the next 9 miles proceeded to be in the clouds. It figures it never got over 50 degrees and the Sun never came out. The winter hat and gloves stayed on all day. I am now descending into my final destination of deep gap shelter.

Was feeling warm, dry and fit. At Midnight I woke up to a blinding flash. Right ater the second flash came the thunder, followed by 2hrs of pouring rain. My tent did not fair so well. In the morning I awoke to find a foot of mud up all 4 sides of my tent. Everything got wet except my sleeping bag because of the 2 inch pad under it. Then I proceeded to lower my food bag hanging 20 feet in the air off steel bear cables. Out of the 8 different bags hanging some super mouse got into one of them. MINE! Had eaten thru my food bag, thru the ziplock bags and had a party with my $7 bag of Cashews and some of my other food. Everything is a big mess.    New plan for the day. Seadog @ I just hiked 3.5 to the top of Georiga Hostel. Dry everthing out, buy some more food, take a couple of showers and get a big day in tomorrow. If u can't adjust to things out here, your done.

Once again that climb out of town was straight up but it was longer than the last few. The terrain is very soft no rocks or roots. I feel good and I'm going to press on because I'm really feeling guilty about only doing three and a half miles yesterday.    Once I crossed into North Carolina the trail went directly up in the air. For those of u back in N.H. I'm talking tuckerman's, Mt. Washington up. This was definitely the hardest hiking day so far. It started to snow 3 different times today. Someone tell Mother nature to turn up the thermostat. Imagine coming all the way down south to hike in the snow. I still managed to take off my shoes and socks and put my feet in a small stream for the eighth day in a row. Between doing that and going very slow up and down hills my feet look and feel better than most. This includes all the young people.

Woke up last night to hamstring cramps and then the uncontrollable shivering around 5 o'clock a.m. I knew then I was getting into trouble. Have never been so cold in my entire life. When I finally exited my tent it was apparent that everyone else felt the same. After many hikers looked at the forecast for tonight which was colder and windier than last night, many are making the same decision. No way am I staying in my tent tonight.      Decided to come into town and stay at the famous Ron Havens Budget Inn. This was a very good decision. There are about 50 hikers here tonight and there's no way I could have survived another night in the Woods. I'm serious, it was the coldest I've ever been in my life.

Was my first bed in 10 days so at 8:45 p.m. I lay down for a little 12 hour nap.    Everyone had to wait for the noon bus out of town this morning so we could get back to the trail. The first few miles where a nice gradual incline to the top of Standing Indian. At 5420 feet the views were spectacular. I was then spoiled with seven continuous miles of smooth slightly downhill terrain. If only the entire Trail could be like that. I was hiking at a slightly faster pace then usual and managed to reach Carter gap by Five o'clock. While signing the register and looking for a place to set up my tent in a very crowded shelter the Sun broke through the clouds and I decided that was a sign to move on. With plenty of daylight left I decided to hike on another 3 and a half miles to Betty Creek Gap. It's a few rustic campground sites and there is only myself and three other women here tonight.

Slept very well and was the warmest night I've had in my sleeping bag.    It's now 9 o'clock a.m. and everybody is exiting the shelter. All the guys are packing up their soaking wet tents and equipment. No thank you. I am anticipating another long day of hiking on the trail. We are getting into more remote areas. So phone service is becoming difficult. If I don't Journal it's only because I'm not able to. Time to hit the trail.    As expected after the rains last night the trail is muddy this morning which makes for slow going. It's almost an equalizer with the other hikers because I go slow anyways. This is probably why I haven't fallen yet. There's a heavy mist in the air and most of the mountain tops this morning are covered in clouds.    Have seen a few hikers today scattered along the trail at stealth sites. These seem to pop up every three or four miles and are really cool. Usually a small fire ring and enough flat ground for one or two tents. I plan on using a lot of these this summer but right now I am not 100% comfortable with sleeping in the woods all alone. On cloudy nights with no moon or stars it is pitch black out. No light pollution here. At the designated shelters at least there's safety in numbers. I'm sure the Bears would save me for dessert and eat somebody else first with some meat on them.

After about 3 miles of elevation I came to a camping spot where for the first time on the trail I felt a little out of place. The entire gang consisted of the 30 and under group. But I recognized a couple of the kids and they asked me if I wanted to join them in the middle of their ""safety meeting"". I declined and let them have their fun. For the most part there have been more people my age than originally thought. The picture you see above this morning is only halfway up the mountain. That was the river I was on yesterday afternoon.

Unfortunately I can only post one a day with the blog. I'm now arriving at my first shelter of the day and I'm going to have breakfast. Hopefully I have phone service tonight in my tent so I can let you know how the day went. Being the first one out of camp feels good but it also means your going to get a face full of spider webs. They call it silk blazing out here (ha,ha). Amazing how busy the forest gets after dark.     It was another hard afternoon of straight up and downs over three mountains. Around 5 o'clock this afternoon I'd realized I was completely out of water and not much food left for my day and a half Trek into next resupply. As I rounded a bend I bumped into a couple around 70 years old with their dog who are attempting to thru hike. They too were completely out of water and looked more concerned than I was.  I told them there was a gap with water about a mile-and-a-half ahead that they hadn't seen in their guide. With all the trail magic I've been receiving lately I hope that there would be something in the parking lot but they were not as optimistic as I was. A while later hearing the traffic below I made out two picnic tables with bright colors on the tops of them.This did not look like your typical hiking gear. As I descended towards the tables I realized it was bananas, apples and cases of water. Perfectly timed Trail magic once again. After three of the bananas. one apple and two bottles of water Iv'e now been rejuvenated and hopefully can make it another 4.6 miles before dark. The power of positive thinking comes thru again.Another great day on the Appalachian Trail. Goodnight.

It was so slow going and soon realized I would not make it to the next shelter for the night. So once I completed Jacob's Ladder I stopped at the top of Tekoa Mountain and quickly made camp before it got dark. Cooked a quick meal and settled in for the night. Decided to check my phone and I got the double bonus. Internet and phone service, a rarity on the trail. It was great to talk to familiar voices back home and do some maintenance on the computer.    The picture today is of me filtering water. The best source seems to be from the side of a mountain or from the ground. I was very concerned when I came out here listening to all the stories of people getting sick but my Sawyer filter has done me right. That blue bag you see contains about a half a gallon of water. I then put a cigar size filter on top of that and pour it directly into my bottles, instant clean water. Most of the hikers out here have the same system. A few others have a bladder system but I'm not crazy about carrying a half a gallon of water on my chest or back.

I let them know in New Hampshire if the water is in a liquid form and not frozen, it's not too cold to go in. They all watched as I submerged under water for a brief moment. O.K. it was pretty cold!   This is such a neat little town. The waitress at the bar and grill last night is also the mayor. Population of Fontana equals 17. We managed to squeeze 7 hikers into our Bungalow last night. In the morning went down to the General Store to resupply for the Smokies and I ate two breakfasts. The shuttle then dropped us off where we picked it up last night and once again off to hike the trail. After the first mile I found myself 30 yards from the shores of Lake Fontana, so for the second time in two days off came all the clothes for lack of anyone being around and into the lake I went.    I guess you have to be careful what you wish for. I am no longer worried about being cold. Drank twice as much water as usual and sweat a lot today. The bugs are also out in full force and most of us including myself are not carrying any spray as of yet. Only 1 mile left to the campground right now and I'm about to climb another Tower at the top of door knob. 35% of the hikers will have dropped out after next week and it seems like everyone is now concerned about the Smokies.    The tip of the day will be to always ask any shuttle driver exactly how much they're charging for the ride. This woman from Canada has been ripped off twice and charged $25 for a 15-minute ride when she tried to exit a van.The same woman this morning asked how come nobody slept with her in the Queen bed last night..Us four guys decided to let her have the bed but I'm finding out here, everybody doubles up on every bed on the trail. I would have been happy to not sleep on the floor if I knew that.

After the first few miles of easy terrain, some movement caught my eye. There was a deer about 50 feet away right on the trail. Then I look to my left and noticed a much largher doe about 25 feet away. As the deer on the trail bound into the woods the larger one just stared at me for about a minute. He's in the upper left corner of the picture above .     For the third day in a row there's not a cloud in the sky. I'm hoping that the 1800 bears in this park can get along with the 1800 thru hikers on this beautiful day     After finishing up breakfast at the first shelter Ranger Bill asked me for my Smokies permit and I was lucky enough to have it handy. Just then a thru hiker was walking into the shelter. We started talking and decided that we have about the same hiking pace so after he quickly ate a snack we headed north together. Very interesting man with the trail name of Costa Rica. One guess where he's from. This guy's 67 years old and in better shape than me. The next 7 hours flew by as I listened to his stories of traveling around the world and I kept him amused with a few firefighter stories of my own. We were about 6 miles from Derrick knob shelter our final destination and figured we would arrive in good shape and early. As soon as we commented that the terrain was great it got hard. I mean crazy hard. So it took us over 3 hrs to go last 6 miles. Very tired, long day.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528576,After a very restful 10 hours of sleep I was pleased to wake up to warmer temperatures. Also was expecting to be sore from yesterday's 17 miles but instead woke up regenerated. I'm really excited about packing up my tent and backpack when it's not sub freezing outside.     I'm cutting my food supply a little too close for comfort. And after a small Breakfast & snack found myself completely out of food. I wasn't planning to carry 8 days of food through the Smokies anyway but had to do the last 9 miles this morning with an empty Food Bag. Seeing Clingmans Dome around 1 p.m. today was the best site I've seen so far. Very hungry and running out of energy so  the thought of going into Gatlinburg today and getting a hotel with a few hikers was the only thing keeping me hiking up the mountain. The trail also completely changed about 1 mile from the top of Clingmans and the spruce Firs smelled exactly like home. The trail also got very shady from the dense forest which was a treat from the now hot sun. Many hikers are now getting sunburned. I thought I was fine until I looked in the mirror at the top of Clingmans Dome ( Highest Point on the AT @ 6644ft). My face looks like a tomato.    After calling for a shuttle with no luck my only option was to hitchhike down the auto road from Clingmans Dome. Many cars drove by me the first 15 minutes and I was starting to Wonder how I was going to get into town from 15 miles away. Finally a couple from Canada in their traveling van pulled over and asked if I needed a ride. Success!  My first hitch on the trail. Halfway to town the driver spotted what looked like another thru-hiker and asked him if he needed a ride. The hikers name was Strider. As you can tell the hiker bond is strong out here and tonight Terodactyle and Strider a 56 year old veteran from Alabama are sharing a Motel in Gatlinburg. This is a road trip of a lifetime. You just don't know what the next day will bring.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528818,"I now fully understand the vortex when going into a trail town. This is just what the doctor ordered. The definition of a zero-day is no miles hiked on the Appalachian Trail. After looking at one of my written journals I realized 18 days in a row without rest was longer than most of the people out here. First up on the agenda was an all-you-can-eat buffet. I went for seconds and thirds and was still hungry. I know I'm losing weight but I'm doing everything I can to maintain. For the first time I really did feel homeless today as I left the major supermarket and ate my hot lunch in the  parking spot with many locals walking by acknowledging that I was a thru hiker. I have to admit I wouldn't mind staying in this town for a week with my feet up eating and drinking but the mountains call.     Immediately after finishing my lunch I was dreading the wait for the Town Trolley to bring me 4 miles back to the motel. I decided to pass the time by making some phone calls which included Miss Janet. She is a trail icon that used to own a hostel in Erwin Tennessee and has spent the last three years following the herd from Georgia to Maine doing Trail magic. She answered the phone and was delighted to hear my voice and asked where I was. When I told her Gatlinburg Tennessee she said we're in Gatlinburg and I then proceeded to tell her at the supermarket and she replied that she was a quarter mile down the road. What are the odds of that? So in her own words she said "" honey I'll be there in one minute"". It was nice to see her and a little emotional. She couldn't believe after all these years I was finally one of the hikers instead of a trail angel. Time to get a good night's rest for a long day of hiking tomorrow. It's hard because there are about 35 thru-hikers at this Motel and a lot of them are taking zeros themselves.    Hope that all 0 days are as fun and fulfilling as this one.

After two cups of coffee 3 Donuts 3 bananas and anything else I could get a hold of I was ready to head back into the woods.    No hitchhiking today because there was a $5 shuttle that would bring you all the way back to Clingmans Dome. The van had to drop off the other hikers at a different destination first so I was the last one to get to the trail. Even with the late 12 o'clock start I made good time with my fresh legs. Briefly coming out of the woods at the 7-mile Mark today were spruce and evergreen trees that had a strong smell of Christmas back home. Just then in the parking lot I noticed a man with a white van setting up Trail Magic. With 50 hot dogs and a case of beer he made a lot of friends fast. I'm now at Ice Water Shelter with about 20 hikers. I'm opting to stay in the shelter once again where it is much warmer. The park has hung heavy tarps in front so it is totally enclosed. This also saves a lot of time in the morning with no breakdown of your tent to get ready.

Even though I estimate the wind at around 40mph it's not affecting me in the least because I'm on the west side of the ridge. The Food Bag on my back for the next three days has a lot of treats I'm looking forward to. Was getting sick of eating the tuna and salmon packets along with rice and pasta. So in town yesterday I picked up dehydrated chili and vegetable soups. With about triple the amount of lunch snacks I usually carry. Right now I have with me a dozen Slim Jims. Numerous Cliff bars, packets of pepperoni, and the always-present jar of Skippy peanut butter which is eaten by the spoonful like all the other hikers.    On a different note I was surprised at the intelligence level of the people I'm meeting out here. Not sure what I was expecting but a lot of the older hikers have either lived in another country for an extended period of time or have traveled the world . I have very little to interject in a lot of their conversations, for a lack of knowledge on the subject. But it's very interesting and I sit and listen and ask questions.  A lot of the younger hikers seem to be going to, or have graduated from Ivy League colleges. It's interesting to listen to them and their perspective on different things. When I don't agree with their theories or ideas I just keep it to myself.    Okay back to the trail. While bloging this I've had about 8 people go by me from this morning so it's time to Huff it to the shelter and have lunch with the gang. My 45-minute Head Start has disappeared as everyone has caught up to me.    The last six miles of the trail today was tough but went along quickly because I spend it talking to a doctor from Maine. It was a nice change from hiking the first 6 hours today completely alone. Just arrived at Crosby knob shelter and it is packed.

I was told right at 7 o'clock that the section hiker with a paid permit just walked in and I could not sleep in the shelter. So I set up my tent on a very uneven slope and the minute I finished the task it rained for the next 8 hours. After packing up a wet tent in the morning and setting off for Standing Bear shelter 10 miles away things got a lot worse. Somehow within the first two miles I lost one of my flip-flops. I ended up falling twice today on wet rocks. Surprisingly both times I was stopped on the trail and was not hiking when I fell.    Just when I thought I was getting close to Standing Bear I took a wrong turn and went a mile and a half extra in the pouring rain. My poncho was also ripped to shreds and looked like I had been attacked by a bear. Finally arrived at Standing Bear Farm very cold, wet and tired. A few hikers commented that I looked pretty bad and one guy came over and jokingly gave me a hug and a beer. Then it was time to make a beeline for a hot shower. To my surprise the pack cover I had found in a hiker box a few weeks back worked out very well and most of my clothes and sleeping bag were dry. Hooray. This is a very unique community and they are self-sufficient with running water, electricity, generators and all kinds of contraptions hooked up to sustain them.    Good company tonight.

Between the peak of thru-hikers and a raging forest fire burning thousands of Acres the town is in a frenzy. Talk to many firefighters which I don't have much in common with because they are forest rangers. But it's still very interesting and they had a lot of questions for me about fighting structural fires in the city.    There was also a crazy incident yesterday morning in which the largest store in town closed and the owner decided to empty all the alcohol in the store dumpster. At 9 in the morning the first thru-hiker discovered this and the next thing you know 200 cases of assorted expensive beers were dispersed throughout the town. The thru-hikers attacked that dumpster like an army of ants. It took until the end of the day before the store owner realized what was happening and padlocked the entire dumpster. Too late!! 250 thru hikers didn't spend a dime on beer this week. and I got my 2 cases of Budweiser.    So for the second night in a row I am staying on a beautiful campsite directly on the French Broad River in Hot Springs.

When I look down both legs were very swollen from my knee to my ankles. There was so much fluid on the top of my shins that I could depress my finger about three quarters of an inch and the indentation would stay in my leg for a minute. All the hikers were rolling their eyes and asking me to do it over and over saying how cool it was. Out of the 20 different diagnosis I got in town, one guy told me that I probably had congestive heart failure. He was serious. Really wasn't amusing to me. Maybe it could be I was doing too many miles while eating very salty foods and not hydrating enough.

Offering a ride back and only having to hike extra half-mile was all I needed. One minute into the walk towards the Hostel and there was a umbrella with a cooler under it. Yeah.

Each orange and egg had a little verse from the Bible but that's how it is with most trail magic down here.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530600,"Another very crowded shelter last night but good music and good stories around the campfire.    After one month completed on the trail I figured I'd explain a few things about how the whole system actually works. Let's start with the hostels. There are over 100 hiker hostels on the trail and these bunkhouses mainly consist of additions to people's houses, garages or even above stores and restaurants. They can be very rustic with nothing but a piece of plywood to sleep on and a shower for $6 or as elaborate as a full kitchen with many bathrooms and Wi-Fi for $30. The Proprietors of these establishments are often times more interesting than the hostels themselves. Quite the characters.      There are over 250 shelters spaced six to 12 miles apart all along the trail. All of them are 3 sided Log Cabin construction and usually sleep anywhere from 8 - 14 people. You will find two other separate trails from every shelter. One will usually head straight down a hill to a reliable water source. The other Trail will go around a Bend for your privy. The privies are usually also three-sided and when you're sitting down you're looking out directly in the woods. If someone were to approach they would see you at the knees and shoulders.    You can also find hiker boxes which are nothing more than a laundry basket or a cardboard box filled with discarded items from the hikers that have passed through the establishments along the trail. Pretty much every motel, hotel, or hostel and any destination that caters to hikers has one or more of these boxes. When getting into town most of the kids are so excited to see food or a place to stay they don't think of asking right away. The very first thing I always do is ask do you have a hiker box? I have gotten many quality items out of these along the way. It's so much fun digging through the boxes. It's like going through a lost and found but you're not doing anything wrong by taking whatever you want.    That companion which you see for the picture of the day is pretty much the Bible out here. Every single thing I mentioned and ten times more is in that book. Elevation, 500 water sources, maps of every little town. Even if you never plan to hike the Appalachian Trail this is a must buy book. I have literally read through this 2 dozen times just dreaming about being out here someday.","Hogback Ridge shelter

The other hiker (Slow-Jam) is from Kansas City. On the way to the Super 8 for the night. Miss Janet invited us to a birthday party for her daughter. One hour later 31 hikers invaded a Mexican restaurant including myself.    At 10:00am the next morning Miss Janet picked the 4 of us up and brought us to Spyvie Gap where we ended yesterday.

Drop us off and 10 of us would then hike back to Erwin Tennessee where tonight she put us all up for free at her daughter's house. Then bring us back to the trail tomorrow and send us on our way. Just too good of an offer to refuse and especially when we're anticipating heavy rain this afternoon and tonight. So it's 12 noon right now and I'm at the top of a mountain getting a little bit of service but I probably won't be able to check in until late tonight. I still have 15 miles to go and I'm hoping I can get done before sunset.     With the sound of thunder all around during the day I was counting my lucky stars for not a drop of rain fell. When the 10 of us got dropped off, a group of the young hikers took off like rabbits and a few of the older guys hung way back so once again I hiked most of the day by myself. The terrain today was very diverse and at one point thousands of red spruce at the top of a mountain once again reminded me of back home.
 It's now 7 o'clock and I wasn't sure how much further I had to go. I knew there would be no showers or way to clean up tonight so I took everything off and once again jumped in an ice-cold Brook. If I only had a crystal ball I never would have made that decision. Because as soon as I got out of the water the rains came down hard. In the 25 minutes it took me to do that last mile, everything I have is soaking wet including my sneakers. When I got to the parking lot and saw Miss Janet waiting it took the edge off a long day of hiking. She explained that most of the hikers finished two hours ago and everyone was waiting for myself and a few other people. Looking back on the day, it was my first and very last time of slack-packing. I did carry my entire backpack but going South just didn't feel right. Never again!! By 8 o'clock that night we were all at her daughter's house. With a very quick change of clothes were off to an all you can eat Chinese buffet. We arrived 35 minutes before closing but Miss Janet has lived in this town her entire life. She has been to all these places hundreds of times so they let us stay 40 minutes after closing. We ate everything they had.

Snapped a few quick pictures and started moving down the mountain to warm up. Dropping a few thousand feet in elevation made all the difference in the world. It was entertaining to watch everyone take all their winter gear off once the Sun splashed through the clouds.    I always start to worry if they'll be room at my final destination of the day when I have a bunch of hikers pass me. Luckily today's shelter is the largest on the AT and Overlook Mountain shelter holds up to 30 people. The barn is now full and there are another 20 people tenting. Quite the crowd tonight. With all the rain we've had the past few days water sources are abundant. The downside of this is the trail is sometimes muddy or is actually two to three inches deep in running water. I still refuse to just run through the mud and water and do everything I can to go around it or rock hop. A big benefit of this is not only dry feet at the end of the day but my trail runner shoes seem to be holding up much better than most.    The weather forecast for late tonight and tomorrow morning is freezing rain and snow showers. But I have a roof over my head and it's a quick 9 miles tomorrow to a hostel in town. That decision will be made tomorrow afternoon when I find out if I've been hiking in freezing rain all day. I know I've mentioned this before but we crossed through three parking lots today with trail magic at 2 of them. Sometimes it happens too often to mention. I hope this good luck last's the entire Trail but it just seems too good to be true.    Another great day on the Appalachian Trail.," Clyde Smith Sheltet

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531528,"I still think I made the right decision by sending my winter gear home but today was the coldest day of hiking I have endured. Being the first one out of Over Mountain shelter out of 50 hikers proved to be a big disadvantage. Ten minutes into my hike I came out of the woods and for the next few hours I went over a long mountain ridge with no protection. 35 to 45 mile an hour winds and Rime ice accumulating on my entire left side of my body was very scary. Not to mention the visibility was about 10 feet. I had to focus and be sure that I would not take a wrong turn for it could be disastrous. There were many times when I was walking completely sideways at a snail's pace so the wind would be at my back and give me a break from the cold. If I haven't mentioned it before the cold is my kryptonite.    I reached deep down inside today and remembered my 4 years of high school as a cross country runner in New Hampshire. As long as I kept moving I would not freeze to death. I equated the day to your boss saying it's Friday and you only have to work until noon. So I pictured a half day of hiking with only having to do 10 miles and I could  get out of work by 12 o'clock. That frame of mind got me to the road by 11:40. I felt bad for Bungie who was about a mile behind me. I talked her into leaving early also and she told me she literally cried for an hour getting over the top of the Mt. today. As usual dropping a few thousand feet in elevation and being on the down slope side of the mountain made it warm and comfortable for the second part of the hike. Everyone in this area is hiking through record cold and rain right now. I can't count how many times I've seen footprints sliding completely off the trail which to me spells sprained ankles or worse.    From lack of experience I realized quickly I'm not good at hitchhiking. It was only three tenths of a mile to the hostel and I would have been better off walking. We are now staying at the Shady Inn for $20 a person with all the fixin's.    So it's the perfect crew tonight Including Giggle Fritz, PBR, Bungie and Grizzly. These hikers are also part of a group that I have been leapfrogging for weeks.    I have just started reading through the last 3 weeks of my guest book. Got very emotional. Thank you everybody from back home. There are so many hikers out here who have nothing to go home too. It means a lot to me and I'm not exaggerating when I say this is probably the hardest thing I've ever done physically and mentally in my lifetime. This is not a 5K, it's not a marathon, it's a half a year of being awayfrom my wife and my family and friends. Not an easy task. 2180 miles of the Appalachian Trail.","Overmountain shelter

Just didn't realize it would be that emotional. For some reason I focused on my grandfather and father in law today. I was mesmerised as a teenager listening to the escapades of my grandfather in World War II. I immediately realized there was no BS in his stories and that he was quite the sergeant of his platoon. Then there was Don V. I considered him one of my closest friends for the last 20 years as well as the best father-in-law on the planet. Thank you Frank Dubisz and Donald Vigneault. So many great memories and the sacrifices both of you made for our country. R.I.P. How could I even think of quitting because of a little bad weather, or a few aches and pains.

I really don't see the point in hiking 15 miles the rest of the day soaking wet like that. Not too smart. Anyway, time to jump in! After that I got very relaxed. I was so tired I could not keep my eyes open. So for the first time on the trail I laid out my ground cover and took a 30-minute nap. It lifted my energy level a bit but it was still a very long day.

Everybody that had set up their tents were getting soaked. Too tired to eat supper and fell asleep in a few minutes.    Woke up fresh this morning and got out of camp fast. The plan was to hike 6 miles to a small resupply store. This first section of trail had been burned pretty bad. Didn't even hear about this fire. As usual morning miles seem to fly by and I was out to the road in no time. Then I spotted a sign on a tree. Yes! Trail Magic ahead. It was biskets and gravy for breakfast with tons of snacks and drinks. I am now at the country store buying food, charging my phone and doing a little wash. Trying to make this a very fast and productive stop.    So the fast and productive stop idea went completely out the window. I said before I started this trail that I would not get sucked into town or staying at Trail Magic locations. But when I walked back from the Country Store the three hikers I had been eating with turned into 23. There was so much to catch up on with people I haven't seen in weeks. Every hour the family that was putting on the picnic came out with new dishes. So there I sat in a lawn chair eating and socializing all afternoon.    By nightfall the hiker crowd swelled to around 40.

Must keep reminding myself that there is no schedule and take everyday as it comes. Everybody was joking today that whenever they make plans the day usually changes them. I am no exception. A one-hour stop at the lake turned into 4 hours but we all have the same problem today. Everybody must hike another eight miles this afternoon for there is Extreme bear activity at the shelter two miles ahead and no one is allowed to stay.

Bird seed, a 19 year old thru hiker from Michigan walked by me and said she was going to continue to night hike to the next shelter. 10 minutes later a young couple now in total darkness stated that they also we're going to try to hike 3 more miles to the next shelter. Shortly after they left my campsite with my fire still going I saw two headlights approaching at a rapid pace.

The first obstacle was getting through the two hundred head of cattle. I was very uneasy as I literally had to walk around some of these animals on the trail while they stared at me with those big cow-eyes. Well I guess that was enough to throw me off for I didn't see the white blaze after closing the gate and did a one mile circle around the perimeter of the farm following the fence. In a half an hour I was back in the same exact spot where I started. Not good. So I could see the party and hear everybody whooping it up. Time to make a decision, just go back to the party or try to make it to the shelter. Long story short I ended up doing my first night hike. It wasn't that bad knowing that I didn't have too far to go. To my surprise when I arrived there were only two hikers sleeping in the shelter. Perfect. I threw down my ground cloth, blew up my sleeping pad and was in my sleeping bag in 2 minutes.    Once again this turned out to be a very good decision. Around 4 in the morning the skies opened up and it rained hard for 2 hours. It was just so nice to be under in a shelter while the rain pounded on the metal roof. Everyone's Pace Quicken today as we are headed into Damascus Virginia. A few old hiking buddies caught up to me and the time flew by as I talked with them for hours while hiking. Damascus is the friendliest Trail town on the entire At and I'll explain tomorrow what trail days is all about. I have just secured three nights at the woodchuck hostel with two of the hikers from Massachusetts. At $45 apiece for three nights and all you can eat breakfast every morning I am very happy because this town is completely sold out and everyone is scrambling to try to find a place to stay this weekend. Some are paying close to $200 for a bed and breakfast.    Most of the plans I've made so far on this trip never turn out. But this one is important. I am getting shuttled 31 miles past Damascus tomorrow with many other hikers. I will still be carrying my full pack and then take the next one and a half days to hike back to Damascus by Friday noon for the weekend festivities.

After pointing out his mistake it took us another half hour to finally get to our destination..    The first four miles of the hike was spectacular. Hiking through the Graceland Highlands with the wild ponies was a change of scenery from your regular trail. At different times throughout the day I stated out loud that I was concerned about making the 22 miles before dark.

When I arrived as soon as I asked if there was room in the shelter a few people spoke up and said no. There was obviously room for two more hikers if you slept perpendicular at the edge of the shelter. I later found out that before my arrival one of my friends had just made a woman take down her tent that she had set up inside the shelter. She was reluctant to do so until he explained to her 3 times that this is an 8-person shelter and she was taking up 4 spots. Once I learned of this I no longer asked if there was available space and around 10 o'clock just put down  my sleeping bag and went to bed in the shelter. No one objected.

So I was on the trail hiking at 6:30 a.m. going as fast as I could on the straightaways and actually doing a slow jog on down hills if the terrain allowed.    Nobody should judge how much hiking you've done in a day by how many miles you've gone out here. Today's 19 miles was probably the equivalent of 12 hard miles. It was the loveliest terrain we've seen and I had 11 plus miles in by noon.

There seems to be a large number of foreigners in this particular hiking bubble. Time to have a few cocktails and watch a movie. About 20 are all meeting in one room to watch Hot Tub Time Machine.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534575,"Wow. Once again I'm overwhelmed at everybody following my journal and signing the guestbook. A quick shout out to everybody at Eversource, Chantilly's, The Firehouse, and so many others around the country. This Trail journals site was the single largest motivator for me to hike the Appalachian Trail. For 15 years I've been reading everyone's Journal. I would get home from work and spend two-and-a-half to three hours and read one Journal a night. Like everyone else out there following me, I would sit in the comfort of my home and dream about 1 day hiking cross-country.I want to again thank my wife for making this possible by supporting this adventure 100% And motivating me to get out there and do this now while I'm still healthy enough to enjoy it. I still wake up in amazement every morning when to my surprise I do not have one sore muscle. I thought after 20-mile days I would wake up creaking and cracking but the slow methodical pace seems to be working. I was just asked to zero in town today and stay with Grizzly and PBR. It's so tempting but this happens often in town and I just want to save those rest days for when they are really needed. I feel good and I'm ready to go, so it's off to the woods for the next 5 days. Today's goal is a 21 mile hike to a zip line that crosses a large river to the Captains place where this man will let you camp at his house for free.    The first 10 miles flew by today which was a good thing since we didn't get on the trail until noon. There's 5 of us hiking together this afternoon and we had a quick lunch at the 10-mile shelter before moving on. It looked like it was going to be a perfect day when all of a sudden the terrain got rocky for a while and then a surprise shower. We all stopped and put on our packcovers and our ponchos only to have it stop raining within 15 minutes. Now there are beautiful blue skies above. It rained just enough to make everything slick and I'm slowing my pace for the rest of the day as the others are pushing ahead. There's only five and a half miles left to the Captain's House and its 5:30 so I'm no longer worried about hiking in the dark the last two miles are all downhill according to my book and the elevation graphs.","Pearisberg Virginia

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534731,"Made it to Captains well before dusk . While everyone was trying to figure out how to run the zip line across the river I decided to take matters into my own hands and just jump in and swim across. Some of hikers near the fire on the other side started to yell as they thought I fell in by mistake. This place is awesome. The gentleman has a perfect setup for multiple hikers and does not charge anybody for anything including a refrigerator stocked with soda.    So I had breakfast in a sauna this morning. At 140 degrees I was the only one that chose this option and it was great. The sauna is out on his screened porch overlooking the river. I overheard a few of the hikers this morning saying that terodactyle is crazy. I guess I'm getting a little bit of a reputation out here but it's a good one. Waking up every morning being able to do anything you want, when you want and how you want it is very liberating and I'm looking forward to a fun summer. Time to hit the trail, we're shooting for 22 miles today.    The first five miles this morning were extremely tough with the mud and rocks. Our plans of 22 miles vanished instantly. It took everybody almost 5 hours to go 6 miles. It didn't help that Mother Nature has finally cranked up the thermostat and we were hiking in the mid-eighties by noon. Personally I still say bring on the heat, it's better than freezing to death. I couldn't seem to get my energy level up at all today and was very tired throughout most of the afternoon. It seemed to take forever to finally arrive at Laurel Creek shelter with 17 miles done for the day.    Today I crossed a very large 6-foot black snake on the trail (should have taken a picture) and three different rabbits one which I actually had to shoo away off the trail as he just brazenly stared at me. Just helped build a big fire but I'm too tired to enjoy all of it, off to sleep.","Captains place

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534946,"Woke up this morning to the birthday plan that some of the hikers had made for me. We all decided that we would not spend more than 3 hours trying to get into town, get picnic supplies for tonight and get back on the trail.    After two easy miles of strolling through cow pastures we came to the road crossing. We put 22 year old (M) formerly known as Jetson on point. She stuck her thumb out and the very first car that passed by pulled over and gave us a ride directly to the store in town. It gets better. We thanked the gentleman and as I was about to open the door to the grocery store two other locals started asking us questions about the trail. I ended the conversation with, how hard it was going to be to getting a hitch back to the Appalachian Trail 7 miles down the road? He then told me he would go home and get his van and be back in 10 minutes. It gets better. So we thanked him and are now buying hotdogs, beer and everything else we need. As we waited that last two minutes in the parking lot another person came up with a handful of Dr. Peppers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. A lot of these small towns near the trail really treat you like a celebrity. I understand it because doing Trail magic years ago I was in awe and treated other hikers like celebrities also. After what has to be a 14 mile round trip record time into town and back to trail we came across a large river 1 mile into the woods. I immediately started taking off my sneakers and jumped in. This time everyone else followed including (M) who decided to take off nothing and jump in with her skirt, blouse, shirt and everything else. Pretty funny! So much has happened today and it's not noon time. I'm very grateful that this group of hikers talked me into this birthday. Looking forward to a fun afternoon with Chuckles, (M) , Curly and the rest of the Gang .    The afternoon terrain was very tough going. The extra 10 pounds felt like 100. It was all worth it though when we arrived at the shelter. Felt a little bad because we did not have enough for all the other arriving hikers. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday on the trail.    The oak tree in the picture above is estimated to be three hundred years old. I joked with everybody about how the wood from that tree could heat my house up north for 10 yrs. Until tomorrow.","Laurel Creek shelter

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535161,Was a little sluggish getting out of camp this morning. Too much fun at my birthday in the woods. The beginning of today's hike was extremely easy. It still amazes me how you can get to the top of a mountain or cross a street and the terrain completely changes. Everybody around the shelter last night was talking about four Pines hostel. I have seen this hostel in videos and I've heard a lot about it. So once again plans changed and I am here tonight with about 40 hikers. Everybody is throwing as much  firewood as they can on a giant tree stump. This thing is almost 5 feet across.    Near the end of our hike today we came across dragon's tooth. It is a rock outcrop with great 360 degree views. I was one of a few hikers that refused to go to the very top like PBR is in the picture. A foot-and-a-half either way is a 200-foot sheer cliff. Since retiring from the fire department I make it a rule to stay on the ground. I would hate to have gone my whole career as a fireman and then die falling off something like this.    With only doing 17 miles today we now have to do a marathon tomorrow. Curly and M have invited 5 of us to her bosses house in Roanoke which means we have to be at the road crossing at 6 o'clock and have done 26 miles. So I'm planning a very early evening and hopefully I'm on the trail by 5:30 a.m. Another very exciting and fun day on the Appalachian Trail.,"Niday shelter

It's going to be a long day!    As usual the morning miles flew by. The early start worked out perfect because with a one and a half hour Head Start Grizzly and PBR caught up to me at McAfee knob. After taking pictures our next stop was Tinker cliffs. Some of the best views on the entire Trail. This was a big surprise to me today. In the afternoon we all melted like snowmen. We couldn't keep up with water intake as there were not sufficient streams on the trail. I don't really remember the last four miles of the hike today as I was sleepwalking in a pool of sweat.    As all 5 of us (PBR,Grizz,Curley,Jetson and myself) emerged from the woods together. Our ride was there waiting for us. As a former thru-hiker this woman knew exactly what we wanted and had a cooler of ice-cold Gatorade waiting in the car. We are now all showered and full from the barbecue they cooked us on their back deck.

I believe I love rest days more than hiking days.    After going to the grocery store for resupply for the next 5 days of food. We came back to the motel and laid out by my first pool of the summer.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535575,"There seems to be a pattern developing when you take a zero mileage Town day. After eating breakfast and contemplating mileage three of us decided that we could get a lot done if we stayed in town again. So I will now run down a typical agenda for a zero-day.    Immediately after breakfast I walked down to the front desk and let everyone know I was looking to get to Walmart 5 miles away. It didn't take long for someone to offer me a lift. Perfect! After 2 months my Dr. Scholl's extra gel pads needed to be replaced. Not that I was having any foot problems but the present ones were pretty nasty. Then it's off to the grocery store. Not to forget the zip lock bags because everything you buy is opened and put in zip locks to save space in your food bag. Most hikers will then empty every single item from their backpack to inspect, clean and reorganize their pack after living out of it for a week.    The ride back this afternoon from Walmart turned into a big adventure. As I mentioned I am not good at hitchhiking. 45 minutes on the highway and not one person even slowed down. I then walked up to a fire station and my luck changed. Initially they stated they could not give me a ride to the hotel for liability and department policy reasons. But after 20 minutes and 2 cups of coffee one of the guys told me to jump in his car and he would bring me back. This was clutch as once again it began to rain. It would have been the worst zero ever walking 5 miles on the highway in the rain. Thanks guys!!!    We invited a handful of hikers to come over and barbecue for supper. Our resident chef decided to cook steaks on the grill. It was fun but I was tired and right after I ate decided to let the young kids stay up and party, while I went to bed.","Daleville Virginia

Eggs and toast two coffees 3 OJ's and two milks later it's on off to the woods. Feel very rested this morning.    I forgot to mention the other day that the trail passed right by the audie-Murphy Monument. Murphy was the most decorated American soldier of World War II. It was on a beautiful outlook off the trail and was interesting to see how many veterans have left their dog tags at the site. The climb out of town wasn't too bad this morning with the sun trying to break through the fog. I'm rooting for the fog because the next three days are supposed to be really hot.    This has to be a concentrated section of the trail. I have never seen so many shelters. They are built every 5 to 6 miles apart. I have stopped at two shelters already but refrain from having a full lunch. Instead I will just snack until supper time. Eating a lot of the same foods for the last two months has got tiring so I changed up the grocery list yesterday in town. Went to the deli first so I could pick out a thick ham and turkey grinder for today. Instead of being one hundred percent healthy I am now going to treat myself to the same snacks a lot of the other hikers have. It's definitely more enjoyable chewing on Skittles and Good and Plenty when you're hiking 12 hours a day. There are only a few Power Bars that I enjoy. My favorite being Gatorade protein bar with vanilla yogurt on top. Okay all this talk is making me hungry. Time to hike on, just needed a break from the baking sun.    It's now 5 o'clock in the afternoon and I've hiked a quarter mile off the trail to Bobbets Gap shelter. Two older thru-hikers who I have not met yet could not finish all the food they packed in and asked me if I wanted a steak burrito. Yes! This not only is delicious but saves me so much time from boiling water with my stove and cooking supper. So I'm taking advantage of the situation and thanked them again before I quickly went on my way. After 19 miles I still feel good and I think I'll just keep hiking until dark or I come across a real nice stealth tent site.    Didn't have a clue that I would be hiking alongside the Blue Ridge Parkway today. What a beautiful section. The trail seem to be crisscrossing over the road every mile or so. Being Memorial Day weekend the parkway is loaded with campers and motorcycles.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535823,"When I reached Cove Mountain shelter last night I was the only one there. This is one of the very few stops where there is no water available. That explains why this shelter is empty. While trying to map out tomorrow's agenda I kept killing these large black carpenter ants. The more I looked around the shelter the worse it got. Really nasty looking spiders everywhere. Then I started noticing the giant cockroaches once it got dark. This shelter is completely taken over by every kind of insect out here. No way I'm sleeping in here, I'll take my chances in my tent with the rain. So I packed up everything with my headlamp on in the dark and set up my tent outside. After listening to thunder for quite some time I fell asleep and to my surprise the rain never showed up over this area.    Started to head down the trail around 7:30 this morning and realized instantly that I did not have my Sawyer water filter with me. Not good. I had left it yesterday at that shelter five miles back. I also have zero water with me at the moment. There's nothing I can do right now but start walking towards a water source. It figures the first time I might have to drink water directly from the stream is in one of the worst places so far on the trail. With low elevation and lots of people around I don't really don't want to take the chance. A few miles down the trail I caught up to a thru hiker named Pirate who I barely know. We hiked together for the next mile and at the stream he filtered two 20 ounce bottles of water for me. I thanked him for the temporary fix then proceeded to jump in the Stream. My whole outlook on the day changed once I got clean and cooled off with something to drink. I had a quarter mile stretch of road work before going back into the woods but I only took ten steps in a pickup truck full of thru-hikers pulled over and asked me if I needed a ride to a campground 1 mile away. Perfect. I'm now sitting at their pool with a full breakfast. The bad news is they don't sell water filters here. My plan is to stop at a big swimming hole a half-mile down the trail. I'm sure they'll be plenty of thru-hikers there since it should be about noon when I arrive. I will just have to find someone to hike with the rest of the day and night so I can bum water off them. What a rollercoaster of emotions the first half of this day. I just had to say out loud this morning Dan, you have got to roll with the punches or you're not going to make it out here. My entire plan of doing 19 - 24 miles is completely out the window today but I guess I have to be good with it.    The search for a water filtering system did not go well today. Very stressful. I also seem to have lost all the thru-hikers I know and have been hiking alone for the good part of two days. Luckily I came across a couple of day hikers and they either filtered water for me at a shelter or outright gave me Gatorade.

Embarrassed but extremely relieved that I am once again 100% self-sufficient out here and hoping to catch up to Curley and M in a few days with some big miles. My double-walled Sea to Summit tent has treated me well so far. The one and a half inch inflatable Sea to Summit mattress also saved my butt during the cold weather but is now actually a little overkill for the summer season.    Packed up quickly today as the bugs are out in full force. Signs of summer in the Appalachian Mountains are everywhere and the shelters are now empty. The last journals you read in the shelter logs are mostly saying that the hikers are getting eaten up alive. It will be tenting for most of the trip from here on in for me.    I learned the answer to a new equation today. Hiking 25, 19 and 22 miles consecutively equals shin splints. They hurt. Very frustrating because I wake up in the morning and would have no problem hiking 14 hours a day doing 30 miles. I'm still so excited to get on the trail but the 55 year old body has other ideas. So after a quick 15 miles today I am now in Glasgow. This is a really neat shelter in the middle of town, completely free of charge. A large dinosaur in town represents the town that time forgot. They are doing everything they can to attract hiker money into the area.    Tomorrow's picture will be of me walking over the James River Footbridge. It's the longest bridge on the Appalachian Trail at 400 feet and a must to jump off of when hiking the AT. It took me a few minutes to climb over the railing and jump the 30 feet into the river but how could I not? Terodactyle has jumped into just about every body of water available. Like they say, when in Rome. So I took the leap.    Staying tonight with a group of hikers with a big German Shepherd who we came across this afternoon. They all got their food bags ripped to shreds and eaten by two large bears last night. As they threw rocks and yelled at the bears the response was with a look of you better cut it ""were bears"". And the German Shepherd did not even bark at them once. They were all in town now resupplying food and buying new bear bags. It was a pretty amazing story and we all believe every bit of it. They left their food bags hanging in shreds at the campsite to show everyone coming by what happened.    Going to sign off for the evening as it's 6:30 and I have to help everyone gather firewood.

Played a couple games of chess with Pirate but after 30 years I'm pretty rusty so he beat me with ease.    Getting a late start out of town. 3000 feet straight up with the shin splints so I doubt I'll make it to the 20-mile shelter. Just going to go slow and see how far I can get today. Hoping the ibuprofen will work.    The afternoon sun was brutal going up the 3000 foot climb out of town. Was leapfrogging with five other hikers and we all were stopping every 10 or 15 minutes for a break. Everyone ran out of water before we even reached the summit. When we got to the top there is a plaque in the exact spot where a little boy was found. A four-and-a-half-year-old who wandered away from school in November and his body was found in April on the top of the mountain when the snow melted. Poor Oddie. With a new supply of water and six miles of ridge walk this was probably the highlight of the day. Off in the distance you could hear a slight rumble of thunder. It teased me for about 2 hours and then the skies opened up. I might as well have dunked my sneakers and socks in the river along with most of my other clothes. The trail instantly turned to a muddy river until I finally reach the shelter. The last spot was just taken by a 19 year old from California but when I arrived she insisted we could make room or she would just set her tent up in the wet woods. She ended up with some friends and let me have the spot.

The only thing that made it a little more tolerable than yesterday was we left early in the morning and were on the Shady Side of the Mountain. Had two Ibuprofen with breakfast and was hoping for the best. Once again this small injury seems to have completely disappeared and felt no shin splints whatsoever for at least the first 15 miles. The last seven miles of the day there was a slight annoyance but I feel confident that I didn't do too much damage to that leg.    Started receiving texts in the late morning from Bungie. Hiked with her and the gang off and on for about a month. She is now off the trail for good but wanted to know if she could drop a cooler of Trail magic for us and if we needed anything special. I jokingly let her know that I was in dire need of some dry socks because everything we have right now is soaking wet. Lo and behold 14 miles into our hike today was a red cooler at the base of the trail with a pair of wool socks in the side pocket. Unbelievable!

I'm shaking sleeping bags and Tents but no one is moving. So I left Camp a little after 5:30 by myself with everyone else snoring away. This morning's hike is reminding me of flying in an airplane. Hiking Above the Clouds looking down on a puffy white blanket. It's so beautiful up here at top Priest Mountain but I was brought back to reality by the handwritten note you see duct taped to the Rock. Being medivac out of the woods from a copperhead or rattlesnake bite is not on my list of things to do this summer.    The 3000 foot climb for the third day in a row proved to be the hardest yet. This was definitely the steepest Mountain I'd climbed to date. It was all rocks and roots and extremely slow and I guess I was going less than 1 mile per hour. What made it worse was there was unavoidable 2 feet high grass completely covering the trail smothered by poison ivy. Every time I contemplated stopping and putting on full pants more grass and poison ivy would show up. I've only got a very few spots and I consider myself lucky looking at the other hikers legs which are really bad.    Being one mile from Route 661 I felt confident that I could do 10 more miles and get to that last shelter. But when I emerged from of the woods I saw three of my fellow hikers and they were waiting for me. The Devils Backbone Brewery caters towards hikers with free showers, free camping and discounts on everything. Change of plans.    After a few hours of having a great time and meeting up with about a dozen fellow hikers I feel better about not trying to push for the 29 miles. Then comes the bad news. This Resort specifically made a place for us about a quarter of a mile out in the woods where we could camp but as soon as we walked out there at 8 p.m.it started raining really hard. So no fire and as I'm blogging a flash flood alert just came across for this county. The water is starting to come into my tent on both sides and for the first time I'm using my super absorbent camp towel to try to fend off the moisture.

So we are going to get a shuttle into Waynesboro and hike tomorrow when the weather is good. A smart decision.    Was a very productive Zero day. First trip was to the Outfitters. I needed two pairs of socks. 850 miles and they are at the end of their useful life. I was also down to four original tent Stakes so I bought four more that I needed badly. I do not have a free-standing tent which means it's critical to have eight stakes to set it up. I was using sticks and anything else I could find which wasn't working well. Next stop was the all you can eat Chinese buffet. I went back for seconds and thirds. I had immediately jumped in the pool when we arrived at the hotel but now it was time for a shower with real soap.

There is supposed to be a long stretch of beautiful weather and today is a great start. On the trail by 9:15. It appears after three straight days of 3 - 4000 foot climbs straight up the terrain will be level all week. It's nice to have some encouraging mileage into Harpers Ferry next week which is the halfway point. Yeah, I can't believe we're all starting to talk about getting halfway done.    If every day of hiking was like this there'd be a lot more people out on the trail. 20 miles flew by and the wildlife was abundant. 6 miles in Otter and Stretch right in front of me had just run back to tell me they saw a bear. I missed that one but two miles further was what looked like a one or two year old bear. He stared at me from about 40 feet just long enough for me to get my camera out. As I waited for the camera to charge the bear strolled into the woods before I could get a shot off. Next up was a 6-foot black snake that I almost stepped on. It scared me a lot more than the Bears did today. I could tell it had been lying across the trail for a while because you could see how everybody was walking around it by the leaves in the woods.    Manage to find a beautiful stream about 4 feet deep which sufficed as an afternoon bath. At the very end of our hike there is actually a list of Trail angels in this town that will come and pick you up or bring you back to the trail for free. Within three minutes I had a ride and asked to get dropped off at the grocery store as I will need 5 days of food to get through Shenandoah National Park. This whole thru-hike experience can be summed up by one incident today as I was walking through this little town of Waynesboro Virginia with all my groceries.

He seemed a bit jealous as he was soaking wet.    It's now 7:30 p.m. and as much as I would love to keep hiking it is starting to get dark. I was not looking forward to stealth camping by myself again as I'm still not comfortable being completely alone at night. Just as all these thoughts were going through my head I spotted two tents set up off the trail in the woods. I was so happy to hear that one word from them, as they called out. Terodactyle! They were the first hikers I've seen all day and at the perfect time. So now I have Bougi and Sailor Jerry to keep me company tonight. The bears will have to eat all three of us. And I think I can outrun these two hikers ( haha ).","Devil's Backbone to Waynesboro

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537369,"I knew it was going to be a long day. But the weather is perfect and the trail conditions are great so my goal was to catch up to my crew. Now that were in  Shenandoah National Park you have to take the good with the bad. The good is that there are a lot of deer, bear and the terrain is easier. The bad is that there are a lot of people, cars and ticks. Some could say there aren't many people and cars but I'm used to seeing no one.     When I came across the three bears today, the two little cubs ran right up a tree and then right back down before going away with mom. Later on in the day I practically had to shoe a large buck that was on the trail 10 feet in front of me. The trail circles around large campgrounds in the park. Sometimes you will come within 20 feet these people's campsites. It's strange to be walking by all these families. I can tell they have no idea who we are and what we are doing. I don't believe they even know they are on the Appalachian Trail itself. Even though the terrain was not steep today, 30 miles is 30 miles and I am dog tired!","Stealth camping

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537427,Woke up this morning and started to put on my long pants to fend off the ticks. Immediately my knees asked me to not do another 30 mile day for a little while. So I agreed with them. Then spent over 1 frustrating hour to login my 5-minute journal entry for yesterday. Service is horrible in this National Park. Please be patient with my entries sometimes the voice activation device does not work properly and the words come out jumbled or misspelled and I can't get service back to edit my journal.    Hiked the first few miles with Pebbles until she pulled away from me. Caught up with IPA around Mile 10 as he was eating a sandwich on the trail. Asked him what he was doing because Slow Jam mentioned his uncle would be at Mile 11 with hot dogs and Trail Magic. IPA stopped eating immediately and we beat feet for the campground. Sure enough one of the first things we saw when we took this side Trail was Slow Jam and his uncle cooking. After a warm-up of two hot dogs some watermelon and snacks we then went directly to the camp store across the street and ate again. For only the second time on the trail I am completely full have no room for anything. Today at mile 20 is the visitor center where they're promising Blackberry milkshakes and giant cheeseburgers. Maybe I'll be back over 140 pounds by the end of the day ( haha ).    It figures that it's now 3 o'clock in the afternoon and I have not come across any grass for the first time in 2 days. So much for wearing the long pants today. Also forgot to mention yesterday that I have crossed the 900 mile marker.,"Hi Top Mountain shelter

We no longer even point out the deer to each other as they are so abundant around this park it's like seeing someone's dog.    Took a nice little nap today on the trail. With all the sun I'm getting and some beers around the fire last night I'm completely drained today. Wish I could sleep here all day but I have another 12 miles to go to catch up to the gang.    It's another beautiful hiking day. I would say perfect but as soon as you stop on the trail the black flies start to swarm. With 6 miles left to the shelter I'm thinking about a smoky fire, long sleeve shirt and bug spray for the night. If that doesn't work I will have to retreat to my tent very early.    As is usually the case the last six miles of the day were the hardest. The hot temperatures and afternoon sun started to take its toll on everyone. Surprisingly when I arrived at the shelter there were no bugs and four women who had been out on a one-week Retreat had tons of food left over which we eagerly accepted.","Rock Spring Hut

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537801,"The first 7 miles today was hiked with purpose. This Camp store in the park was only one tenth of a mile off the trail. The entire game plan for the morning was to stop at the store for Blackberry shakes and cheeseburgers. It wasn't nearly enough to satisfy my Hunger so after having that for breakfast I followed it up with a banana, a milk with Carnation Instant Breakfast and a gigantic Danish roll. I was still hungry but the prices are outrageous at these stores in the national parks so we figured we would try to eat some of our own food. Shortly down the trail I came across a young couple from Sweden doing Trail Magic. It was round two and I ate and drank everything they offered me period for the first time ever on the trail it's 12 noon and I believe I am completely full. It feels good.     The Good Fortune I received the first half of the day took a 180 degree turn in the second half of the day. Although the mountains were smaller today they mostly face the sun and it was very hot. I then got information from two different elderly couples that stayed at the shelter we all plan on sleeping at tonight that there is no water. Many streams have turned into a trickle or nothing at all. We are all loving the fact that it hasn't rained on us in some time but we're paying for it at the water sources. I am heading down to the shelter now and I'm sure some of my friends in front of me did not get that information. I hope they didn't arrive at the shelter dry or it's going to be a long night.      The picture you see today was of a horse stable literally 10 feet from the trail.

I had packed in 18 hot dogs from the store at lunch. They were a nice night cap after we ate our regular supper and worth the extra weight for the last 12 miles of the day     As we left the shelter this morning everyone decided that we would go into Front Royal after an easy 3-mile downhill hike. Saying goodbye to Shenandoah National Park this morning was with mixed feelings. The Abundant wildlife and the trail magic was fantastic but the amount of people in the park made it feel like you weren't actually on the thru-hike.This morning a new town record was set as we got a ride within 1 minute, ate breakfast and were back out on the trail in under an hour and a half. A truly perfect town stop where I can still do 20 miles today. Today's picture is a bog Bridge in the middle of the dry dusty tundra we are walking on. I went to wash up at a stream yesterday and realized my entire body turn to mud wherever I got it wet. We are covered in dust. If it doesn't get too hot this afternoon I'm going to hike right up until nightfall. The next shelter 5 miles ahead has a solar power shower, the only one of its kind on the trail and I'm looking forward to a noon wash up.    Okay the solar powered shower was out of service so the stop there was brief. It seems like everybody in our group was picking a different destination today including myself who decided to stealth Camp alone for the 4th time on the trail.

The trail was much harder than expected. We hit the famous 13 Mile stretch called the roller coaster. Nine straight up and downs of about 400 feet each. I was really exhausted when I arrived at the Bear's Den. I was immediately informed that nothing was open until 5 accept the showers. So I charged the phone while taking a shower and spread out all my gear to dry in the afternoon sun. A few of my friends just arrived and they want to head back out and do another five or six miles. I think it's a great idea. I feel energized and cooled off so I will not be staying here tonight.  Heading back out and hiking until dusk. That way I am sure to get into Harpers Ferry tomorrow and have my picture taken at the ATC which is the unofficial halfway point of this journey. Unbelievable to think I will be there tomorrow. I thought it would be a more emotional moment when I walked by a 1000 Mile Marker today but it was on a very steep incline of the roller coaster and I was exhausted. Didn't even take a picture which I now regret but needless to say it's done. 1000 miles under my belt. Feel pretty good about it.    The other large number for the day you will notice in the left-hand column of the homepage. Over 50,000 views since I stepped on the trail. Thanks once again for all your words of encouragement and support as well as just following me along on this trip.

She looks pretty beat up at the moment. Fell face-first today. Also bruised both shins pretty badly and ripped her shoes to shreds. Thank God we're all going into Harpers Ferry tomorrow. She's going to need a new set of hiking shoes and a couple days of quality rest.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538076,"Slept like a baby last night. Woke up this morning and packed up quickly as we usually do when there's a town to look forward to. The first 10 miles flew by today as all I could think about was resting my legs and staying in Harpers Ferry for a couple of days. There were very few streams today that we could get water from and at mile marker 11 the shelter was the last water stop until we got into town. It just so happened that it was a quarter-mile straight down on a side trail with a trickle of water and then a quarter-mile straight back up. It was literally the hardest half-mile of the entire day. Pebbles had caught up to me at that shelter and mentioned that she felt very tired today. I immediately put two and two together and mention to her that that could be a sign of a concussion. She didn't even realize at the time that she had a huge three-inch gash on her forehead from her fall yesterday. Not many mirrors out here in the forest. As advertised the last seven miles into Harpers Ferry was fairly easy and mostly downhill.    I walked into the Appalachian Trail Conservatory and immediately got my picture taken and signed in. I am thru-hiker 699. It was so neat to look through their photo album and see the hikers I know who are in front of me. As soon as I finished up at the ATC Otter immediately picked up the five of us for a quick shuttle to his house. This place is beautiful. His mom came out with every different kind of vegetable you could imagine as a warm-up to the barbecue that followed. Truly heaven and a much-needed rest. I'm clean, I'm full and we are all staying downstairs for a couple of days with a 80 inch flat screen and everything else you need at our fingertips. I have to mention when the woman at the front desk of the AT Center ask me to sign in and if I was a thru hiker. I turned and held up a finger to motion, wait a minute. Yes, I am a thru-hiker. Got very emotional signing in to the halfway point of this hike. Wow, this ranger just called me a thru-hiker.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538253,"It's difficult to fathom that this trip is half over and I've hiked all those miles. Looking at the next few hundred miles of the trail it is almost completely flat but the equalizer is that it's loaded with sharp jagged rocks. I have decided to wait for my new hiking shoes from my wife until I get through the rockiest portion. I will just try to stretch these existing shoes out the next two weeks until they are completely trashed.    I would like to do a few things different on the second half of this journey. Among those I would like to stay in the woods longer and do less town stays. That means a heavier pack with more food but the lack of steep inclines and declines I don't think an extra 5 pounds will make that much of a difference.    My backpack seems to be getting even smaller and lighter as I am still getting rid of more clothes. Feeling extremely comfortable out here in the woods and actually prefer to hike alone most of the day. There are a lot less hikers out here now and the last four shelters have been virtually empty. It's going to be a completely different scenario than the first two and a half months out here.    When I checked into Harpers Ferry headquarters yesterday not only was it emotional but so exciting to see faces that I have not had contact with since the beginning of the trail. One girl came up and gave me a big hug though it took me a while to figure out where I remembered her from. She is also in the original picture on day one of me starting on Springer Mountain. Although a lot of these hiking days have run into each other and I can't remember every day I will never forget that first day climbing up Springer Mountain and looking at the plaque.    This has also been one of the most relaxing 0 days I've taken. No parties or running around town. Just eating, watching TV and resting the legs for the second half of the hike. I finally drew blood for the first time yesterday when in a rush to get here scratched up my right leg pretty good. I still consider myself so lucky to have no poison ivy, no mosquito bite scars, no blisters no sunburn, you get the picture no nothing.

I wish the whole day of hiking could always be like the first few hours. Odie and I left together and 3 miles into the hike stopped to use the bathroom at a state park. A couple out for a day hike ended up giving us their leftover food from breakfast. We immediately ate it right in front of them. This seemed to be the theme for the day. It got hot quickly today and the water sources were few and far between. Everyone was complaining that they were out of water. I used mine very wisely    Plans changed multiple times today as I tried to text a bunch of the gang. I did manage to get a quick swim in under a bridge. You have to take everything off now or the wet shorts will cause irritation. After going back and forth with multiple hikers and trying to step up with the pics with little water I was completely exhausted when I reach the final state park around 6 o'clock. The trail today was either very easy or extremely hard rock climbing. It just kept jumping back and forth and you never knew what you were going to get around the next corner. I was pleasantly surprised that two of my friends were waiting for me at the State Park and we immediately jumped in the river followed by a quick trip to the store for ice cream and hot dogs.

With only one other hiker choosing this option I thought it would be fine. After 2 hours of almost going deaf,I grabbed all my sleeping equipment and set up under the picnic table. Slept great after that. You can sleep just about anywhere as long as you have that 2 inch inflatable sleeping pad. 5:45 am, time to beat the heat.    Once again all of today's miles were State Park family friendly. Mostly level, extra wide, no rocks and no roots. Pretty much a golf cart path for most of the 18 miles. This allowed Wicks, Pebbles and myself to easily get to our beach destination by 1 o clock. Pine furnace State Park also happens to be the place for the famous half gallon challenge. The trail literally goes right by the store and the beach. The goal is to eat a half a gallon of ice cream in half an hour. For the last few days I was getting myself psyched up for this but old age and good judgment took over and when I got to the store I knew that buying a large hiker Burger with all the fixin's and a side of fruit salad was a much better choice than a half a gallon of sugar. Took some ribbing from the other hikers who all ate the ice cream but I need protein.    Could not ask for a more perfect day on the Appalachian Trail.

It concerned all of us because we were low on water and according to the guidebook the next source is 5 miles up the trail. For the first time that I know of the book was completely wrong and that was a good thing. 300 yards after starting to hike this morning I came across a brook with a nice flow, similar to a faucet on full blast. I drank one liter and filled my two bottles as a few other hikers caught up to me and did the same.    Early on in the morning I started to hear a very faint rumble of thunder. As time went by it of course got louder and louder. Finally the day turned to night and I almost needed my headlamp to continue in the already dark thick forest. Luckily I missed most of the hail and the real heavy stuff. Within a few minutes it stopped raining for the rest of the day. Easy terrain again allowed us to get into Boiling Springs by 2 in the afternoon. This was definitely the hottest day on the trail and reach 93 degrees as we found our way to a gas station for Gatorade. We were talking about trying to hike another ten miles to make sure we could get to Duncannon tomorrow when a woman overheard us on the porch and said ""I just opened a hostile today you should stay at my place"". We all believe it is her first day open as she is only charging $10 a person for a bed, shower and all the hot dogs and eggs you can eat. Don't really see how she's making any money. But this was too good to pass up. We figured we'd push our luck and ask her a big favor so the hikers voted me to do the talking. I asked her if it would be possible if we hike out of town this afternoon another six miles and then she would pick us up at the road crossing and bring us back to her hostel. She agreed. First we had to run across the street as everybody was starving. Long story short, the pizza place gave us a large free pizza because they said they made a mistake out back.    The last 6 miles today was a piece of cake. All cornfield hiking. Such a different environment than we're used to. The first ten miles out of town tomorrow will be all the same. I'm now at the hostile with this woman and her husband and it is probably the best deal we've come across so far. Super friendly very nice house and so inexpensive.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539178,"A quick note to start today off. ""The hostel"" we stayed at last night in Boiling Springs is a must-stop. It was one of the friendliest, nicest and most inexpensive hostel we've stayed at. Our gracious host took us all back to the trail at 7:30 this morning. Those extra six miles we did last night were crucial because the trail had some surprises for us today. We were lulled into a false sense of security as the first 10 miles were all cow pastures and level, easy hiking. But I rarely look at my guidebook before I head out and today I should have. There was a special note in there with a six mile stretch of all rocks. This section was slow-going an extremely rough on the feet. These rocks are sharp and angled at every direction. I'm so glad I still have my original shoes on. They will be changed out in 2 days. I would have hated to put on my new hiking shoes and ruin them out of the gate.    The goal for the day has been accomplished and we made it to Duncannon Pennsylvania exactly at 5 o'clock when the Lutheran Church opened their doors for an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner. This also came with unlimited fruit and salad. Some of the hikers thanked me for letting them know about this free feast. More and more people on the trail are asking me about what is coming up next or for advice. Looks like 15 years of planning this hike is paying off for me and whoever is in my vicinity.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539304,"I will be posting a lengthy Journal sometime this afternoon durning my zero day in Duncannon. Among other subjects I will cover gear, my thoughts on the trail and tips on hiking.    Question number 1. Do you really need hiking poles? The answer is YES! This is not an opinion. This is a fact. Crossing 300 streams and rivers. Hundreds of steep mountains up and down not to mention you have two weapons in your hand for defense. 95% of the hikers have poles. The other 5% have taken very nasty falls and are working their legs twice as hard as everyone else.    Question number 2. Have you seen any rattlesnakes? No but many of my fellow hikers have seen more than one and it makes me nervous because I opted to not bring a rattlesnake kit.    Question number 3. How do you keep a charge on your phone? Everyone who's carrying solar panels for their phone are complaining. We are mostly in a canopy of tall trees similar to the Amazon. It does not allow enough sunlight to charge the phone. Basically you use your service very conservatively and we throw our phones into any outlet we can anytime,anywhere. The other day everyone picked an exit sign in a restaurant that had an outlet and we had our phones hanging from there. Adapt and overcome, roll with the punches, it's the only way to make it from Georgia to Maine.    Question number 4. How do I Journal so often? There is a lot of time and effort put into the very short Journal that you read each day. Often it's on my third or fourth try that I can get service and actually blog. I would love to make every Journal 5 times as long and much more informative but there are not enough hours in the day. I never thought in a million years I would look forward to going to sleep as soon as the sun sets but that's reality out here. In the fall when I'm back home I will go through every single journal and add information that I remember from the trail, fix punctuation and spelling and try to make this a memorable blog.    So after coffee and a ride to the grocery store to resupply our host dropped us back off in Duncannon we're Pebbles and Stretch we're anxious to get back to the trail. I had no intention of leaving today as now my knees are bothering me especially when I sleep. Solution. A 24-hour day of rest,ibuprofen and hike slower. Have to slow down!

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539476,"Getting a late start out of town this morning. 8:30 a.m. and it's time for a quick coffee before I hit the trail. My backpack is the heaviest it's ever been with all the goodies everyone sent me in the mail. I'm also going to wear my original trail runners for another week before I put my new ones on. The rock's here are pretty bad and like I mentioned before I don't want to ruin my brand new salomon's.    Changed my mind as I was about to go out the door. There is no room to carry two pairs of sneakers so here we go with the new tires on. I immediately crossed the Susquehanna River this morning. It must have taken me ten minutes to walk over the bridge as this river is close to a quarter mile wide insome places. Pretty neat. The hiking today was slow. I'm tired, maybe had too much fun in Duncannon yesterday. The bug spray I got in one of my packages couldn't have come at a better time. I am using that as the black flies seem to be relentless the last few days. There seems to always be a few around your head starting around noon and lasting the entire day.It is still not bad enough yet to break out my bug net. And I believe if I don't use that net soon I will be tossing it. It's one of the very few pieces of equipment I've been carrying for a thousand miles and have not touched yet.    It seems now that I am past the halfway mark, have many more thoughts of finishing this trip and returning home. Trying to put that in the back of my mind as there is still a long way to go. Just going to look ahead to a warm, wet, fun, summer out here in the woods. Hiked all day alone yesterday as now my hiking buddies are either in back of me or in front of me. Question for the day.Do I speed up or slow down?

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539728,"This turned out to be one heck of a day. My initial goal was to just wake up early and hike as long as I could so I could get close to my buddies. But the more I hiked the more the adrenaline kicked in and I ended up with a very full day so here's the timelines.    4:40 a.m. got up for a very quick cup of coffee with hot chocolate and 2 honey buns.    5 a.m. sharp hiking on the trail.    10 o'clock a.m. it's warming up and I'm concerned about water. The streams here are all dark brown or orange and I was told that mining 100 years ago has contaminated a lot of the water sources. Just as I was about to give in and try to filter from one of these streams a day hiker approach. I used my best Yogi skills and with a little desperation asked him where I could find a good water source as I was out. He immediately reached into his small backpack and offered me a 24oz bottle of water. This was perfect, it also saved me that .7 miles round trip it would have taken to filter from the stream. Not to mention it probably would have clogged my Sawyer system.    10:30 a.m. I passed my first shelter and realize I've already got a dozen miles done, things are going well.    2 o'clock p.m. once again I'm running low on water with the midday sun and humidity really cranking up. As I was about to stop and look at my book for the next water source, out of nowhere there was a bright red cooler in the woods on the trail with a garbage bag next to it.  The suspense was killing me as I emptied all my garbage into a container and then checked the cooler. I was disappointed as it felt light and empty but when I opened the lid there was one root beer left on ice. This was probably some of the best trail magic I've had in a while because it was so unexpected and needed. Grabbed that can and off I went.    2:30 p.m. I looked off to the right of the trail and there was the first thru-hiker I've seen in a day and a half. The herd of hikers has thinned out and spread out and there is much more hiking alone during the day now. He had his guidebook open so I asked him exactly where I was and how far I had to go to get to the famous 501 shelter for pizza. It was only another 10 miles.That meant I had done 20 miles already.    6:30 p.m. arriving at the 501 shelter to find that my friends decided to go further. I was stunned but had to think quick on my feet. There was no time to order pizza if I was going to try to catch them so I ordered a sub on someone else's order and within 10 minutes the delivery person showed up. I still have some energy left so I grabbed my sub and ate it while I hiked. Another five miles would get me to the campground and be my longest day of the trip. But finally at the end of the day my good luck ran out and as the sunset and the rock's got bigger and harder I knew I was not going to make it before nightfall.    9 o'clock p.m. I'm guessing I had about another mile left but it was pitch-black and as I turned my headlamp on my light was dimming quickly. Probably the scariest moment I've had on the trail    9:15 p.m. I hear voices and I'm praying that the trail is heading towards them. Normally if it was just thru hikers in the woods I could walk right by their tents and never know as everyone would be fast asleep by now. But this was a local Campground and the trail was now heading towards them. I heard loud yelling and some fireworks.    9:30 p.m. I can see a fire .My head lamps out and I'm crawling at a snail's pace not to break an ankle on the rocks. Thank God there was a full moon and I could focus on the ground. Walked up to the fire as someone was shining a light on me and heard the best words of the day. ""Hey it's Terodactyle, how did you get here?"" Easy I just hiked 35 miles in the Rocky terrain of Pennsylvania on a really hot day. They couldn't believe it. Frankly neither can I and I don't ever want to do it again. I have to say I am not bragging but very proud of myself. Once again these people were treating us like celebrities and immediately handed me 2 bottles of water some baked potatoes and hot dogs. Was so happy I was about to cry. It was difficult but I fought back the tears because there were too many people around. A very long day on the Appalachian Trail. $10","Yellow Springs campsite 85/64

I was hoping that Rocksylvania was all hype but everybody's feet are getting beat up pretty bad and now I've joined the blister club with five little ones on my left foot. If I haven't mentioned it before I do have numbness in 3 of my toes and the top of my foot that has now persisted for weeks. I've heard of this happening before and it should subside one or two months after I'm done my hike. Also informed my group last night that I might be slowing down and doing less miles. Don't want to spend my entire summer pulling big days chasing people down the trail. This trip is half over and I've got to relax and take in everything I can.

Just when we were about to give in and start walking a gentleman pulled up in a beautiful pickup. The first thing I noticed when he got out of his truck was the .45 around his waist. He was an on-duty undercover policeman and was more than happy to give us a ride to the hotel.    Odie's dad showed up shortly after and he's a fireman in Pennsylvania about to retire so as you can imagine him and I have been chatting for quite a while.

It was great meeting new people and forgot to mention Odie's brother is a professional basketball player. He's a point guard over in Germany and makes a good living doing what he loves. Jake and his dad refused to let us pay for anything the entire 2 days. That included the hotel room for two nights and the tickets to Hershey Park.     The weather was great today and the hiking for the most part was really easy. Was in such a good mood and have a great plan for the next two days. An easy 17 miles to a four-sided shelters with bunk beds and a hot shower. Odie actually slowed down enough yesterday for me to keep up with him and I got to know him a little better. Pebbles would start the day 3 hours behind us as she had to wait for the Post Office to open at noon. Yes this post office in Port Clinton was only open half days. As the afternoon approached I got very excited about the shelter and picked up my hiking pace. Passed 5 hikers including Oddie. I was very close to the shelter figuring I would secure a bunk for sure. That's when the rest of the day took a turn for the worse. Not focusing and hiking as fast as I could I overshot the road I was supposed to turn down. Went another mile down hill into the woods before I stopped, look at my guide and realized my mistake. Very upset and figuring everyone I passed now had taken the remaining bunks I decided to hike on 8 more miles to the next shelter. Big mistake. As I cursed myself and Hiked angrily the next few miles I once again stopped to look at my book and realize the shelter was further than I thought. That's when the distant Thunder started. Hiked with a purpose, for next three and a half hours before I got to Allen Stone shelter. At one point a deer leaped out of the woods 3 feet from me and scared me to death. Don't think I ever walked in rain this heavy. Showed up at this very crowded and small shelter soaking wet. A very tough and disappointing finish to a day that was going so well.

The morning Sun was shining but it was only 6am. and my clothes were too wet and cold to put on. Thankfully I went to the laundry two days ago in town and had spares of everything. Early into my hike today I remembered a story that Oddie told me yesterday. It changed my whole perspective instantly and my attitude for the rest of the day. His last adventure was a bicycle trip across the country. He was 300 miles from finishing at the shores of California when he stopped at a hostel just outside of Las Vegas. After only being in the building a minute he returned to find EVERYTHING gone! Bicycle, tent, cloths, phone. He figured since he was in Las Vegas and had $200 left in his pocket he would double down or go home. He walked around back to the casino input a $5 chip down on his lucky number. The second $5 chip was a winner and he took that $180 combined with his original Money and went to a Walmart to buy an inexpensive bike and a $15 tent to finish his Trek. He Shrugged his shoulders at me and said ""no big deal"". So I missed a nice shelter and got wet last night. I'm hiking the Appalachian Trail and this should be no big deal.    With my friends 8 miles behind me I decided to push on to Palmerton, Pennsylvania where I noticed in the guidebook that Bert's steaks house will let you stay in their garage hostel for $10. It's much nicer than I thought it would be and the shower is a good one. They also had over a dozen hikers last night because of the rain and apparently they left me plenty of free beer. Today made up for yesterday.    Want to let everyone out there know that the Pennsylvania rocks are no hype. I was hoping that it would last a few days or maybe a week but we are almost 2 weeks in of extremely tough hiking and today I took my first real fall. Thought my ankle was a goner for a minute. One hour later because I have to look down at every step I smashed my head on a large tree branch. It almost knocked me out and I was feeling my upper and lower teeth to see if they were still all there. So my head, teeth and ankle are sore but I'm sitting in a clean garage all by myself having a cold one.    By the way, the picture you see above IS the trail.","Eckville Shelter

All in all I feel like I should be hiking today therefore with a late start I'm going to drag myself out of this beautiful town around noon time. I would love to come back to a lot of these places and spend multiple days in each one.     Okay. The day's plans have completely changed. Sassy and pharmacist just showed up and other hikers are on the way. I have decided to relax, rest my feet, ankle and head and enjoy this town today. Unfortunately one hour after the hikers arrival pharmacist sliced his thumb open with a knife deep enough to call for a hospital visit.

Found out this morning it is coming out of Palmerton. Halfway up this 500 foot pile of Boulders I came across a couple of thru-hikers a little older than me. The woman was frozen as they both had their packs off and we're trying to help each other over the rocks. I'm surprised that there's such a dangerous section here on the Appalachian Trail. Got to tell you I was a little more than nervous myself.    5 miles into my hike this morning I heard voices in the distance. As you know it means one of two things a parking lot or Trail Magic. It happened to be the latter. Two young men who hiked the trail last year and live nearby. It's now 1 o'clock and I've been here for hours.

One of the hikers with us was a nurse and when she took a look at it she said to me ""it's a good one"". Luckily after 5 minutes or so the blood stopped flowing but with no water anywhere and in the middle of the woods it wont be till noon tomorrow before I can clean this thing up.

There was nothing but a small 3-foot jersey barrier between you and the tractor trailers zipping by at 70 mph. Felt like the wind from the trucks was going to blow you over the side of the 100 foot tall structure. Lots of day hikers in this area.

The initial goal is to go 27 miles but with this heat it's unlikely. After the first five miles and not looking forward to this very long day, Otter caught up to Huskers and myself. Other hikers soon arrived and as usual when we congregate it's a great think tank and source of information. Someone mentioned that 2 more miles down the trail there is a restaurant one tenth of a mile down a side trail.    The dozen hikers arrived at the restaurant exactly as they opened. A sign on the front door said hikers enter through back gate and stay on deck. Pretty funny. This place is on a beautiful lake and it took me about 4 seconds to take everything off and jump in. About half of the hikers followed. A record quick lunch with a large cheeseburger and two waters that were consumed in 10 minutes and I was the first one back on the trail. It's the only way I can stay ahead of this group and try to get a long day of mileage in. It was a very refreshing break.    It's now 3 in the afternoon and we only have 9 miles left. Finally caught a break with the rain as it started to pour after lunch. I looked up and saw a sign on the tree that said shelter .01.

To kill time during the shower I had my second 2nd lunch within a 3 hour span.    This morning today's outlook wasn't that good but now it's turning into a very nice day as we are on top of a huge Pavilion taking one last rest before the nine mile push.

It has been just as hard as the Pennsylvania rocks and maybe even slower as we ascended and descended 4 different cliff like hills. today. Again I'm wondering how the older hikers behind me are going to get over this section as I had to throw my poles up the mountain and climb hand over foot over these boulders. It's now noon and there's no need to stop for lunch today as I'm quite satisfied with the magic I've had this morning.    It's starting to get dark now and reflecting back on today I was in an exceptionally good mood. I like hiking slower and taking my time. 4 Trail magic stops and one jump in the lake has put me 2 hours behind my hiking Buddies. But I don't mind waking up early and I will catch them in the morning. Still got my 20-plus miles in today as the cliffs magically disappeared this afternoon and the trail got match easier. Going to hike for one more hour and hopefully find a nice stealth site preferably with someone who has already started a fire. This is very hard to stumble across but I've got my fingers crossed.","Stealth camp site

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541803,"Felt much more comfortable last night stealth camping in the woods alone. But did not sleep well due to achy knees. Definitely going to take some ibuprofen tonight before bed. Those cliffs yesterday did a number on me. Made the 2-mile trek to Perkins Memorial Tower this morning by 6 a.m. Could have stayed up there all day. The views were spectacular with the contrast of a never-ending sea of forest and the skyline of New York City in the background. Something you don't see everyday. Don't think the pictures will capture it as the sky line was 35 miles away.    I'm now at the Trailside Zoo where the AT runs directly through it. Thru-hikers get free admission. Unfortunately the zoo does not open till 10 so I'm trying to kill time by eating ice cream from the vending machines. The bear cage exhibit is the lowest elevation point on the entire trail at 124'. Quite different than my first month on the trail where I was constantly between 5000 - 6000 feet.    It will probably be a relatively low mileage day as everyone has to go into town to resupply. Besides food I need to charge my phone and phone charger, batteries for my headlamp and fuel for my cooking stove. This town stop is a must. Plans are to stay at the free church hostel. I can only hope it's as nice as the one last week.    So after waiting 2 hours to go through the zoo it was a very disappointing 10 minute quick walk. Things got worse when I exited and took a wrong turn crossing the Hudson River which is the picture of the day. I realized when I got to the other side that I completely missed the side trail to town. It was a very long, hot hike for the next 3 hours until I came out of the woods to a deli. After a much-needed meal and small resupply I moved on 1 mile to the church hostel. It is not as nice as the others, In fact it's just the opposite. It has the least facilities to offer out of any hostel I've been to. But I'm here and it's hot and I'm staying put at 13 miles today.","Stealth camping before the zoo.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541982,"Started the day by hiking 1 mile back to the deli for breakfast. Probably never would have done that the first part of the hike but the extra calories and quality of food is worth doing an extra mile. Chocolate milk, bananas, egg's, sandwiches and chicken salad.    I tried not to get too excited but was very much looking forward to Clarence Fahnestock State Park. Halfway through the day came upon somebody's food bag on a rock directly in the middle of the trail. I figured it was one of three hikers that had gone ahead of me earlier. I kicked it into second gear and caught all three of them only to find out that the it was not any of theirs. Feel bad but if I don't catch the person by tomorrow I will start lightening the load by eating the food.    Arrived at the state park around 2 and bumped into numerous hikers that I have seen in the last few days. I'm now in my element walking around the beach jumping in and out of the water and eating at the concession stand. As you can see in my picture I'm officially homeless as I spread out all my gear clothing and food to dry out in the sun.    4 p.m. and the party's over. Time to pack up and do the last 5 miles to the shelter tonight. It's important for me to get a spot as there's an 80% chance of rain late night and tomorrow. Hope the weatherman is wrong as usual.

Had a little extra pep in my step as I was shooting for the Connecticut line today. Hiked with a new person this morning named ghost and we both left for the trail at 5 a.m. sharp. I thank him for slowing a little so we could talk for a few miles. By 8:30 in the morning we had covered six miles and decided to go to a New York Deli that was a half mile off trail. It was worth the trip.    A little after noon I came across a lake and decided to go for a swim. Didn't find out till after my dip that the signs all said Nuclear Lake. Should be interesting what I learn when I look this up later on tonight. As we left the lake I was with two other thru-hikers when I heard a very deep growling of a dog. I spun around to see the dog charging the other two hikers. It ended up sprinting right by them but they were very shaken and so was I. I'm sure we would have won the battle but someone could have lost a calf muscle in the process. Very scary.    At a road crossing around 4:30 this afternoon a sign said ""come to the flower shop, we love thru hikers"". It was only a hundred yards away so I went to investigate. This lovely lady started right in on her speech. There's a free shower out back although the water is very cold. And soda and juice in the refrigerator at a discount price. She also sold fuel canisters for our stoves which no one has been able to find for weeks. I'm so glad I went. I left there after doing all those things while my phone was charging and felt fresh and clean. But I knew I would not make the Connecticut line. Was just running out of gas this afternoon. Did the last 5 miles to Wiley shelter which made it an even marathon for the day. 26 miles in this heat isn't too bad. And I can't wait to see what Connecticut brings tomorrow. By the way the picture above was special to me. When I saw the sign on the shelter showing Mount Washington I couldn't believe it. Finally feels like I'm on my way home. Good!!!","RPH Shelter

For the second night in a row I woke up at midnight and had to spray myself down with deet. Then around 2 p.m. I felt the pitter-patter of four little feet scurrying on the top of my thigh. Took the silk liner and flung it up in the air to hear the little guy hit the side of the shelter and drop to the ground. No more mice and mosquitoes for me, it will be a little warmer in the tent but I'll be safe from the critters.    So the hikers have been dropping like flies. Saw two different girls throwing up from dehydration and heat exhaustion in the last couple days with many more not feeling well at all. The heat is taking its toll on everyone including myself. After hiking over 100 miles in the last 5 days from dawn till dusk the cumulative effect is starting to show. 12 - 13 hours a day of hiking in this heat is just too much. Got to find a good place to zero around water although the black flies are relentless and I'll be sure to have my tent set up with plenty of bug spray. For the second day in a row they never let up from 8 o'clock in the morning till 8 at night. Being buzzed like a deer in the woods. Very annoying. I've been lucky enough to not get them in my eyes yet.    The only thing that kept me going today was a large cup of coffee right off the trail and constant news back home that my son is doing extremely well with his college golf career this summer. I even contemplated flying home tonight to watch him tomorrow. My entire family has told me to stay out here and keep hiking but it's killing me that I might miss the greatest victory of his young career. The sacrifices you make when you commit to a five-month Expedition!! He is 12 hours away from being one of the youngest New Hampshire State amateur champions at 20 years old. If anyone out there would like to check it out just go on and nhga.com.

I knew I was completely exhausted from the last 4 days of doing 20-plus miles in the heat. Then I made a bad decision. I rushed. I sweat profusely. I didn't have fun and hiked as fast as I could through the 90-degree temperatures and humidity. Connecticut was supposed to be easy. But the first 10 miles today were straight up and straight down. Very discouraging. Halfway through the day as the trail took us on a perimeter run of a 2 mile cornfield. I ran into IPA who I have not seen in a month. It was a godsend as for the first time on the trail I had zero energy and my legs felt like they could go no further. His family showed up with Trail magic and they were shocked that I opted for two lemonades and two waters instead of beer.     After hiking through another Marathon today I arrived at Salisbury around 4 o'clock. Pbr's parents met us at the post office shortly afterwards. I immediately went to the grocery sore and got a chocolate milk, yogurt and a bananaThen I started feeling so sick I had to drop to the ground in front of these people I just met. I knew what was happening to me. Dehydration and exhaustion. How embarrassing to meet the people that are taking you into their home and in the first minutes of introduction causing a scene. Slow jam took a look at me and told me to stay down on the ground as my lips were turning white. Never had this happen to me before.

Can't imagine something like that charging as you would have no time and no defense against an angry bear.    Planned on 31 miles.

Pretty sure it's just lack of sleep with 14 hours of hiking and 6 hours of sleep a night I'm not getting enough rest. Did manage to jump in one pond and have a nice lunch by another.

The 3 miles flew by and I was amazed. It was everything I thought it would be and more. The extra half mile walk both ways was well worth it. I was greeted by a female caretaker who immediately asked me if I was hungry. My answer was, are you kidding? They still had leftover pancakes and coffee from this morning's breakfast. The caretaker was so nice and showed me around this beautiful cabin which sleeps 14 upstairs and a separate room for caretaker and guest. Unlike the White Mountains I can actually volunteer for a week every year and be the caretaker. It would be another dream come true so. Most of the volunteers are from out-of-state. I extracted as much information from her as possible and I'm pretty sure I could start doing it next year. They do ask you to come up one week in May or June for some training. The next three hours were spent rolling off the dock into the lake and then getting back on for some sun.    I've then ran into a young hiker who I had seen a few times in the last couple weeks. Christina had also lost her group after going to New York City with her mom for a few days. We hiked the afternoon together and she was also heading into the town of Dalton Mass tomorrow.

We were a few thousand feet up and that coupled with cold temperatures and a stiff breeze meant no mosquitoes. It worked out okay. This morning was a quick 3 miles uphill to the top of Mount Greylock. The highest point in Massachusetts. The Tower looks beautiful but right now is completely surrounded in scaffolding like the Statue of Liberty was. Arrived there one half hour before opening but after looking pitiful and walking by the window four or five times an employee let me in and gave me a free cup of coffee. Eventually my hiker companions showed up and we had a good but expensive breakfast.    The next seven miles were a gradual downhill and I figured I could catch up to my friends.    This is what I like about not dissecting the days map all the time. Came out of the woods and all of a sudden found myself on the 3rd Main Street in 24 hours. North Adams Massachusetts. Had absolutely no intention of doing anything in town and was about to cross the street and go right back into the woods when a Southbounder was approaching. Most of them started from Maine in late May or early June This is going to be happening for the next month. When southbound meets northbound there's a quick exchange of very important information about what you will be coming up on next. I asked what the scoop was in this town and he said right down the road Papa John's has half price off everything for hikers. Change of plans. Now sitting under a tree in the back of the parking lot with a cold beer and a half price cheeseburger pizza. Life is good. And I just contacted my friends ahead and told them I will still try to make it to the shelter but it will be around dusk. I don't feel too guilty as it is just after noon time and I have completed 12 miles.     Just after entering Vermont around 4 o'clock this afternoon. The trail turned into a jungle. It's amazing how each state is so different with Trail maintenance, shelters etc. It was starting to get dark and very obvious I would not make it to the next shelter once again. There was also no where to set up a camp. You could hardly even walk on the trail and see your feet. That's how thick the woods were for a few miles. Finally at 8:10 when I was starting to get worried a perfect stealth spot opened up. There was also copious amounts of dead branches around and I instantly made a big fire to keep the bugs at bay. Right after setting up my tent the young couple from the UK came walking by. They had their headlamps on and we're ready to do night hiking but when they saw my spot with available space they asked me if they could join. I was more than happy to have the company as I've been camping alone a lot lately. It's hilarious to hear these two people talk in such a strong accent.

The plan was to resupply enough to get us to Hanover New Hampshire.    Then as if someone waved a magic wand over our group great things started to happen to us in rapid succession. We were concerned about the five and a half miles hitch into town. Crossing the street to stick out our thumbs a gentleman waved us down and asked us if we wanted a ride into town. Bingo. But before we could get our packs in the trunk a State Park Ranger asked us if we knew about the trail magic party that was about to take place in that very lot at 11 o'clock. Put on by the Green Mountain Club these people had quite the set up. We figured we could get into town, get everything done and be back right at the beginning of the buffet. As we neared Walmart this gentleman told us of a huge discount store for hikers and without waiting for us to answer started driving us there. Discount was an understatement. Everything in the store was 90% off because it is just expired. We spent about $10 apiece on $100 worth of food. And before we could get out of town Slow Jam spotted $40 on the sidewalk. We were laughing and just waiting for something else to happen. We figured bags of money would just start falling out of the sky the way things were going. After an unbelievable lunch buffet we headed back into the woods to try to get the last 14 miles done.    I guess it all depends on how you look at things but are good luck was not over. We hiked the next 10 miles over some straight up and down mountains. Vermont does not believe in switchbacks. With only four miles left and walking directly by a shelter we stopped for a quick break. Being one that loves weather what happened next was unbelievable. We literally had our packs on ready to do the last 4.3 miles. Five other hikers left 10 minutes before us. Within 30 seconds the skies turned black and then we saw off in the distance funnel clouds and rotation. The packs came back off and within 5 minutes it started to rain and hail like most of us have never seen. This lasted for about an hour. You could not even talk to the person next to you as the hail hitting the roof was deafening. Needless to say nobody's going anywhere tonight and hopefully we will get an early start tomorrow.

By word of mouth we heard of a place called Linda's which is directly on the trail and serves supper and breakfast as well as letting hikers sleep in her garage. This is not in any of the books and she wants it that way as last year by just hikers talking about it she said she accommodated 1600 of them. I showed up to find slow jam and Christina waiting for me on the porch with fresh hot dogs chips and drinks. All you can eat with a 20 foot deep swimming hole across the street. How could this day get any better. I literally never touched any of my food after 7 a.m. this morning and I am going back out on the trail now at 6 p.m. with a full belly.    Another wicked pissah of a day on the Appalachian Trail.","Cabin @ Fire Tower

Then the elderly woman driving stopped right in the middle of the street. I thought she was going to offer me a ride when the passenger's window came down. Instead she leaned over and pointed at me and with a little hesitation said, ""Your Terodactyl"". When I asked her if we had ever met she stated no but I've been following you from the beginning of your journey. It gave me goosebumps. Can't believe these people are recognizing me from my journal pictures. There have been a few campfire conversations missed and some miles not gotten done because of the daily journaling. But when things like this happen it makes it all worthwhile. This journal will probably be my favorite souvenir.      Everyone in the hostel was up by 5:15. Very excited to enter New Hampsthire this morning. It's now 9:30 and we just crossed the bridge into New Hampshire. Yes I said New Hampshire Yahoo!!!    Hanover is an extremely hiker friendly town. There is a list of people in town who will take you into their homes free of charge. We have no intention of staying but we're going to take advantage of the town's hospitality. First stop was Lou's Bakery where we get to pick out any one item for free. Next was The Brick Pizza Barn where we get a slice of cheese pizza and a 20 ounce beer for free. The grocery store is conveniently located right on the trail as the AT makes it""s way through Main Street.    It was a rough climb out of town and I immediately lost my two hiking partners. Hiked alone the rest of the afternoon and right up until it was almost too dark to set up my tent. Pretty much all the streams and small brooks are completely dried up. 25 miles hiked.

I was on a mission to get done hiking as early as possible. Had a preview to what's coming up in the Whites as smart mountain and Mount Cube where no pushovers at 2000 feet apiece straight up. They were also extremely Rocky and rooty on the way up but much gentler on the way down.     So why all the big miles? Why the big push to New Hampshire?    For those of you who don't know me that well. My wife and I purchased a vacation condo in the heart of the White Mountains about 5 years ago. I have been doing Trail magic every summer when the thru-hikers come passing by in August and September. This was Monumental in gathering information for my thru-hike. But now I'm extremely excited that I can do trail magic for thru-hikers that I actually know. Hikers that I've spent months with. New friends. So after getting my 17 miles done by 2:30 this afternoon I was met on the trail by my wife who I have not seen in 4 months. You can imagine it was quite a long needed hug. Also want to thank Brenda and Jeff my in-laws for coming to meet me. The kids will be coming up tomorrow to see Dad and I will actually be with my whole family. Wow.     It was a coincidence that I also ran into Sailor Jerry and Bougi this afternoon who I hiked a lot with at the beginning of this trip. Perfect, as we are all now in an outdoor hot tub facing Loon Mountain. I am way ahead of schedule and tomorrow will be a big fat Zero as I hope to take in four different hikers that I have spent this trip with.

I still consider it a zero because I only did 5.1 miles today. Earlier I dropped off my guests and I was in a perfect position to get 5 miles done before breakfast and still consider giving my legs a rest.    So far this stop in Lincoln is turning out exactly like I hoped. As my friends and I went to the Price Chopper Shopping Center all of a sudden we were greeted by a stampede of hikers that we had not seen in months. Again very emotional. People were hugging, crying, screaming like crazy in front of the store. This is everything I've wished for for the last few weeks. I have actually made a hard copy of the guests that will be coming to my condo in the next few days. And literally have no room for anybody else till Friday night. I'm sure this will be the last time I see most of these people for the rest of my life so I'm going to cherish every moment and make it as enjoyable as I can for all of them. As much as I love hiking I am already anticipating the hikers that I will be spending the next 4 nights with. Treating them to some of the best trail magic they have seen this season.    Went next door for supper to Britney's Cafe. Inexpensive food and big fun. The gang seemed to like the place.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544475,"It was a late spring day 9 years ago when a young local from Lincoln New Hampshire was testing out equipment for his future thru-hike. Chet West was an avid outdoorsman that spent most of his time hiking, biking and snowboarding on the surrounding mountains. When he was not working at the large outfitter store in town you could find him waiting for his next call with the volunteer fire department.    Then one night when testing his new canister stove his life changed forever. It was a first-year stove and there was a major defect in the construction of it. The stove blew up in his face with fuel igniting his entire body. When the fire department finally arrived and found him collapsed on the front lawn they all looked at each other and thought the same thing. Are friend is not going to make it. Chet was flown to Mass General where he spent the next four months in an induced coma. His dad got five different calls in that time period stating to come down and say goodbye as they thought they were losing him for good. This guy never gave up. He beat all the odds. In numerous papers in New England they had dubbed him the Miracle Man.    When Chet finally regained consciousness he realized his past life was gone forever. With massive internal damage due to inhaling superheated gases among other things he was left legally blind, permanently damaged lungs, lost his gallbladder, and had burns to his throat with 45% of his body being skin grafted. Chet would be confined to a wheelchair the rest of his life.      So what is one to do? Give up, throw in the towel, quit. Not this young man. He took that fuel company settlement to purchase a very modest house. Then took part of his home and garaged and turned it into a thru hiker hostel. There would be no fees or charge for hikers to stay. He was just there to help those who needed it most. The Whites are some of the hardest terrain on the AT to resupply for food, shelter and find inexpensive housing. When my wife and I bought this little vacation condo up-north I immediately tracked down Chet. We had much in common and are interests in the Appalachian Trail made us instant friends. I never come up to the mountains without stopping by and visiting. We have been in constant contact the entire hike, as I call Chet every two weeks and give him updates from the trail. I can tell he hangs on every word like many others living vicariously through me. So when I'm having a rough day or should I say very rough start with the freezing temperatures in Georgia. One of my inspirations was Chet. So what else was I going to do? Give up, quit, throw in the towel. This guy would give anything to even attempt a thru-hike. What would my excuse be? That I'm too cold. That I miss the comfort of my bed or driving my truck, or my family that will be there the rest of my life once I get back. No way, not me, you couldn't drag me off this trail. I realize there's too many people out there that are physically or even mentally incapable of this cross-country journey and can only dream about something like this. I'm one of those lucky people who has the ability to conquer this expedition and with four hundred and fifty miles left I feel more confident than ever that I will end up at that sign on Mount Katahdin around Labor Day. Yes, I'm doing this for me. Some people say this hike is a selfish act. But I also have other reasons. I'm doing this for every Chet that is out there rooting for me and enjoying my journey as much as I am .     A day of relaxation and reflection on the Appalachian Trail.","Rest Day. / Trail Magic

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544885,"Looking at our hiking books there is a massive climb out of town this morning. 4000 feet of elevation mostly straight up. But either I'm in better shape than I thought or I was just very rested and the early-morning climb went much easier than expected . Was disappointed when I summited Mt.Moosilauke to find I was in thick clouds and heavy fog. There would be no views today. Also had to use the piles of rock caren's to stay on the trail. When you're above tree line these man-made piles of rocks every 50 yards are the only way to keep your bearings.    Then came the second half on the trail that everyone has been dreading. The steepest downhill on the entire AT for north bounders. As I descended the skies cleared up and the breeze increased which helped me get down the mountain. At some sections the information in the hiking book tells us the descent is steeper than the actual waterfall that we follow down the mountain. Rebar into the side of rocks and 6 x 6 wooden steps are drilled into this rock scramble. It was difficult for me to maneuver my way down and I can imagine almost impossible to do  on a rainy day. Have heard of more than one hiker falling already this year on this section of Trail. ** (found out a month later that Stretch fell in this section and it ended his hike. At least he will get a head start on law school)**    Once I survived the steep descent and was hiking my last mile to the Kinsman Notch parking lot a group of 9 young hikers approached. None of them had backpacks, hiking sticks and most were not even carrying a bottle of water. They started asking me questions about the section ahead and I explained to them that they had just picked probably the most difficult and steepest section of the entire Appalachian Trail. After a brief conversation and then telling me that most of them were beginners at hiking they all turned around and decided to pick a different Mountain. I think it was a very smart decision.    A great transition day of hiking. Looking forward to my first full day back tomorrow.","Glencliff Hostel

Very tough going for the first 10 miles and considerably dangerous at certain sections. Finally reaching the top of Mount Kinsman the views were spectacular. The only sign of civilization was the newly constructed condos in the town of Lincoln. The red dot in a sea of forest looked like a miniature version of the Mount Washington hotel. It's so nice to be back in my home state of New Hampshire. There were so many crystal clear deep pools of water to jump in it was hard to make a decision. After passing four or five of these Oasis I finally decided to get wet before lunch.    Later in the afternoon I arrived at the first hut in N.H. Lonesome Lake Hut is beautiful but the system in New Hampshire is not without controversy. As nice as the structures are they can be extremely expensive to stay in. Well out of a thru-hikers comfort zone. People from all over New England embark on a short day hike to spend $120 apiece to sleep in these wooden structures with no electricity or heat. Basically the same shelters that we have been sleeping in the entire journey for free. But there are enough cash customers to have these Hut's booked months in advance. The only way a thru hiker is able to occupy one of these is to do a work for stay. This might include washing dishes, helping with dinner or giving the paying guests a presentation on thru-hiking. Today's picture is of the lake in front of the hut.    The rain started shortly after I finished my hike today and I was very happy that I avoided getting wet. The days of zeros did not seem to help today as my legs and knees are very sore. Other hikers have told me that this would happen after a prolonged rest.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545002,"White Mountain miles are wicked tough Appalachian Trail miles. Started the morning at 1555 feet and by noon was at 5300 feet. Mount Lafayette might be one of my new favorite places in New England. Unbelievable views. Was listening to seasoned hikers compare it to the Alps. Immediately after summiting there were lookouts everywhere. I found one with sun shining through the canopy of trees and took an extra long lunch.    Even though I am a lifelong resident of New Hampshire I have never seen the White Mountains from this point of view. This Trail brings you deep into the Wilderness where very few have ventured. It's miles of extremely rough terrain boulder hopping and cliff climbing. Late in the afternoon I came to a section of the Whites which I never knew existed. Between two mountains were hundreds of Acres of small 2 foot trees that looked like waves in the ocean as the wind was whipping them. I thought I was in Scotland for a moment. Then for the first time in my life the wind actually blue me to the ground where my knee caught a rock. It hurt for a moment. Nice stinger.  As soon as the pain subsided I caught my other ankle between two rocks. The scenery was so spectacular I just wasn't paying attention. I had to stop and say to myself out loud ""focus on the trail. Dan"".    I was rushing to try to make Zealand Falls Hut before dark. It was going to be tight. As usual in my haste at the end of the day when I'm most tired and my head is down, I got lost. Before I realized my mistake and asked an oncoming hiker to confirm, I had gone almost a mile the wrong way. I was crushed! There's no way I'm going to make the hut now. So after yelling a few choice words I just chugged along until dark and pitched my tent about 2 miles from the hut.

Don't know how much more physically my body can take. After getting lost yesterday I made up those two miles this morning to Zealand Falls in a hurry and then took a quick dip in some ice cold water. This was one of the very few sections my wife and I have actually hiked before. And it was nice to recognize the next three miles.    Then there was a little surprise in the afternoon. 5 miles of completely flat soft Trail. I really didn't think that existed in this state. What a treat. The rest of the day was tough up and downs and I figured I had no chance at work for stay at Lake of the Clouds Hut. The hut systems here charges tourists $120 a night but will take in the first few thru-hikers that are willing to help with chores. After everyone is done eating the hikers get to finish up leftovers, sleep in the cafeteria on the floor and get leftovers after breakfast. I always told myself I would never take this option if I thru-hiked. Today the timing and circumstances just happen to be perfect. When I got to the hut at 6:30 I immediately went to the front desk with Pebbles from Maine. She just happened to arrive at the same time, to inquire about a work for stay. He said they had two spots left and they were evening spots. Perfect. That means I would do all my work at night and be able to leave in the morning whenever I wanted. Happy to report that it turned out to be a fantastic experience.  They had Pebbles and I rearrange the meat cooler. Much better than doing dishes for 45 minutes. The other hikers who opted out of work or were just too late, slept in a damp, dark, cement cellar floor right next to the outhouse called the dungeon. It was bad. On top of that the scraps that we got to finish turned out to be all you could eat lasagna, carrot cake and chicken noodle soup. I ate so much I had to loosen the straps on my shorts. Then drank 3 cups of coffee and four Hawaiian punches. To top the whole experience off it was a balmy 75 degrees in the cafeteria all night.

She just happened to be in Lincoln New Hampshire so she scooted over to Chet's Hostel to pick up PBR, Pebbles, and Sweetfeet who are about a week behind me. After the heated swimming pool and jacuzzi she brought them back to Chets with four large pizzas. I'm sure they were a hit with everyone else at the hostel.

Should be an interesting morning.    Unfortunately the morning turned out to be more interesting than I wanted. After going about 1 mile straight up it was like being on Mount Washington all over again. Was in a huge cloud with winds of 50 miles an hour. When I finally got back down and made the four miles to the first shelter I realized that my pack cover was gone. It blew right off my back without me ever realizing it. It could be a new record for the lowest miles today as I just finished the Mahoosuc Notch and Arm.

No more scary downhills with a thousand oversized slippery steps. The next six miles were actually therapeutic as I was able to stretch my legs and return to my blistering pace of 2mph (ha, ha). As I got to the only road crossing of the day with no one around I stopped and opened my pack to take a rare look at my book and what was ahead of me this afternoon. Just then a young woman in a pick up out of nowhere stopped and asked me if I needed a ride into town. I told her I wasn't really planning on it but she was right here so that might not be a bad idea. I then asked her how hard it would be for me to get back to the trail as this road says ""tough hitch logging road"" in our hiking book. It was at this moment everything changed    Sarah stated she would bring me to the Country Store, run a quick errand and bring me right back to the trail. OMG perfect! I immediately went into town mode when I got to the store. Looked at the menu for 2 seconds and ordered a large chicken parm sub and a large hamburger sub. With the next breath I asked the woman behind the grill where I could plug in my phone. As I was hooking my phone up I glanced to my right to see the large selection of cold beers. Nope. Not today. This was going to be a high calorie, high quality stop. While waiting for my lunch to cook I made the mistake of going back into the store. I picked up a large blueberry muffin, half a pound of ham, a large coffee, 2 strawberry milks and a powerade with a large bag of chips. Sarah returned in 20 minutes as promised with her two beautiful daughters aged two and three.Their blonde hair and crystal blue eyes made them so charming. I was back at the trailhead in one hour flat and my head was spinning. My phone went from 25% to 85%. My stomach went from 10% to 100% full. And as soon as I waved goodbye and started walking on the trail my eyes mediately welled up. This was probably the single most important act of trail magic I've received on this journey so far. I needed it really bad and the timing was impeccable. I will never forget it, thank you Sarah.    It's now 5 o'clock and it's starting to rain. As I pulled off the trail I remembered I'm down to my last dollar store poncho. With no backpack cover, thanks to the hurricane winds the other day. I came around the corner and to my surprise there was a shelter. Had no idea I was that close to one. There was no one there and I made up my mind I'm not going anywhere the rest of the night. I spread my stuff out like I owned the place and even got a good fire going for a while with bundles of dry wood and kindling that someone had left in the shelter. Fell asleep at 7:30 to the sound of pouring rain hitting the tin roof top all night. I consider this a game-changing day for my last few weeks on the trail. 14 miles the hard way today!","Baldplate Lean-to

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546038,"Well, we had been complaining about the lack of water all summer. There's plenty to go around now. I probably went by 20 water sources today. If you can see in the picture, those rocks are supposed to be above water. Three times today I had to take my shoes and socks off and ford these things. The last one of the day was over my knees and a little scary. A father-son from Georgia watched intently as I made my way across. One slip and everything I own including myself was for going for a swim. A fast swim! When it was their turn to cross Southbound I had to chuckle to myself as I heard him yell ""this water's freezing"". I never really noticed as I was just focused on not falling. Don't know how somebody could do this without poles.     Even though the terrain was much easier today it was still very slow. Everything was soaking wet. Slipping 3 times today on the rocks and roots, I was fortunate enough to catch myself before going down. There was also the hundreds of mud puddles that I still refuse to walk through. So I took my time to step around these and save my feet from a dirty, damp day. Looking back I can remember in April hiking with Sea Dog and him laughing at me because I would not walk through the mud and water if at all possible. Don't really see the point in saving a few seconds by trudging through the mud if you don't have to.    The last Shelter I hiked by today had two very large huskies in it. I could hear one barking from 2 miles away before arriving to see them with their dirty paws walking around the shelter floor where the hikers would be sleeping shortly. Pretty inconsiderate of these people. Glad this wasn't my final destination today or I would have had to say something. Once again I'm stealth camping off the side of the trail alone tonight. Looking forward to a quick resupply in Rangeley tomorrow. It's a 10-mile hike into town and I'm hoping to get there around noon. Time to cook my supper in the dark and call it a night.","Hall Mt.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546120,"After 3 comfortable miles this morning Sabbath pond appeared. It was beautiful and the water was much warmer than I thought it would be. Another quick bath before going into town. It again was such a treat to be able to actually use my poles and legs to hike at a quicker pace. My shins started to get sore but I didn't care, I was moving again.     Got to the road leading into Rangeley and with my thumb out tried to get my 5 Mile hitch into town. 20 minutes later it was time to think of alternative options. Then all of a sudden an SUV going the opposite way drove by me, they pulled a fast U-turn and came back. This is always a good sign. When he pulled over I recognized the face. This young man had given me a ride three months ago in Damascus Virginia on Trail Days. And apparently recognized me right away. He was staying at The Farmhouse where slow Jam and I are staying for the night and offered us unlimited rides throughout the day to the grocery store and to the restaurant to get lunch.    After doing all our town chores and getting settled it was back to The Farmhouse to check into our bunks. It's really is a beautiful place. And then it happened again. A 69 year old hiker named Swamp Fox who was just sitting on this Farmhouse porch in Rangeley Maine looked at me and said. ""Your Terodactyle"". This is getting to be incredible. The word trail celebrity has been used more than once from other hikers. Apparently this man has been following me like others since April 1 and to see his face light up to know who I am sent chills up my spine. Spent some time talking with him about the trip. He is in the picture above.    Enjoying a beautiful fire tonight with great friends and some old hikers that have caught up to me. It's so hard to leave these hiker towns. I am planning on cooking breakfast for 10 hikers tomorrow at 6 a.m. It'll be all the french toast and scrambled eggs they can eat. Time to have a cold one and go to bed.","Sabbath day pond

A rainy day would have been a great reason to stay in town but it's not in the cards. Slow jam and I should be back in the woods by noon. Would like to come back to the town of Rangely someday and get to know it a little better.    It was a day for climbing ski resorts. First up Saddleback Mountain. The locals yesterday informed me that Saddleback didn't open last year due to the lack of snow. This year it is for sale and the town of Rangeley is paying for that economically. The Summit of Saddleback was beautiful and with 360-degree views the walk above tree line continued for miles. The ridgewalk was a pleasant surprise. Way off in the distance you can see the next ski resort, Sugarloaf. It's a 15 mile hike and I will be there by noon tomorrow.    Got into Poplar Ridge shelter early enough tonight to start a nice fire. The few hikers that were there really appreciated it as they stated most times everyone has been too tired to get a fire going. Going to try to get up before sunset tomorrow morning. It will be 22 miles to the next camping site. With the trail getting back to normal I think that's a doable day. Time to get a fire started for the evening.","Rangeley Maine

Took a 7:30 am dip just before a huge climb and have to admit the water was pretty cold. Shortly after my swim I was enjoying the silence of the forest when I looked up to see an adult bull moose 25 feet ahead of me right on the trail .What a huge rack on him. Got 3 pictures of him before he wandered into the woods. They didn't come out too good and I'm much more imprested with the picture I posted tonight. 2000 miles. Feels like I have been out here forever. This was not an extended vacation or a long trip, but a complete change of lifestyle. Very much looking forward to returning home..    The day turned out to be harder and longer than anticipated. But once I crossed that 2000mi mark it was all worth while. Fell 1 mile short of getting to the campsite so I am tenting off a dirt road with Rock Star tonight. Very tired. I even turned down trail magic beers around supper time.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546481,"Another early start this morning. Today will be all about getting as close to Caratunk Maine as possible. This state wasn't quite finished with us yet as there were a couple of surprise thousand foot descents in a very short distance. Lots of rocks. Just as I was completely out of water a sign said ""spring 250 yards ahead"". I'm thinking, where could this be at 3000 feet elevation and giant Boulders everywhere. Then a wooden box appeared. When I opened it sure enough, ice cold, crystal clear water coming from a 1 foot Oasis. As far as water goes it was the best I've ever tasted. Right after filling up my water bottles an older man approached. He looked familiar and we said our pleasantries before he hiked on. Then I remembered where I knew him from.  He had a trail magic feast by a pool in Virginia before leaving the trail to take care of his terminal mother back in  early June.  He had  just got back on @ Katahdin to hike South (flip-flop) the rest of his hike.    The views along North Horn Pond and Flagstaff Lake were incredible. Then there was the perfect view of the ski slope side of Sugarloaf. Yesterday I was looking at the south side of the mountain.It's always amazing when you can see off in the distance what you will be climbing in the next day or two. As promised from the southbound hikers in the early afternoon the trail got very easy again. I turned the turbo on and see how far I could get before dark. Managed to cover 23 miles. Which leaves me a scary 12 and a half miles tomorrow morning. The canoe ferry that shuttles you across the Kennebunk stops at exactly 2 o'clock in the afternoon. With the promise of an easy Trail tomorrow I should be okay with an early start. Plenty of stars forming in the sky tonight so I think I'll be fine pitching my tent instead of trying to make that last mile and a half to the shelter.","Cranberry Camp Site
",Otter pond,"Aug 21, Sun",23
Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546497,"(Yesterday and today's journal will be posted now).    Last night's decision to stop short of the shelter turned out to be a very bad one. Around 1:30 a.m. it started to rain very heavy. I was again awakened at 5:30 to water coming through the roof of the tent. Then I looked down to see the only thing keeping me from lying in a pool of standing water was my one inch air mattress. This was going to be a rough morning. Normally I would not be as concerned. I could just go to the next shelter and start drying everything off. But there is no next shelter. I must make the 12.5 miles to the Kennebunk River ferry or I'm really screwed.
    As I was literally sitting in a puddle of water two quotes came to mind that I said out loud to give me motivation to get through this day. ""When the going gets tough the tough get going"". The other quote came from my brother-in-law when I was having a bad day out here months ago. ""Suck it up cupcake"".  It took me a while to complete the almost impossible task of putting my two ponchos on over myself and my loaded backpack while still inside my dripping, sagging tent. Once accomplished I stepped outside in the pouring rain to break down my tent. What do I do now with this 5-pound bag of mush? I wedged the bag between my hip belt and my chest strap and carried it on the front of me like a mother carrying a baby in a harness. Just one more thing to complicate this now difficult 12 mile trek over slippery rocks and roots, while rain continues to pour down. This once easy trail has turned into a three inch deep stream. Decided for once I would really push the limits and just make believe this was a 12 mile race. Didn't really see any other option. Long story short. While only slipping twice and dipping my foot in 5 inches of mud once, I reached the shores of the Kennebunk River around noon. I could see the lone ferryman sitting in the canoe waiting for his next passenger. I looked at him with a big smile and he hollered back ""no lines no waiting"". Just what I wanted to hear.     The rains had stopped and now the river had started to rise. My idea of getting an inner tube and swimming across was not meant to be. As I finally emerged to the road I saw my first thru-hikers of the day. Three young men and a girl we're heading into town. They told me the best hostel was right around the corner called The Caratunk House. Boy were they right! This was another hostel that was not in the book and is run strictly by word of mouth on the trail. This place is at full capacity tonight. And for $20 the hot shower, internet and spectacular rooms are a bargain in this 200 year old farmhouse. Probably the best deal on the trail. The caretaker said he had one room left but it's two beds to a room if I don't mind. Pretty funny when when I knocked on the door and saw my roommate for the night. SLOW-JAM! This room with it's private bath would cost $250 at the Mount Washington Hotel. As the day took a 180 degree turn I am now a happy camper.","Otter pond

The resturant we were at had a giant hot-tub next to the outdoor seating. When a family of 5 paid their check and left the other hikers dared me to go over and finish the plates of food they left behind. They really didn't have to dare me. I grabbed a half of cheeseburger and a bunch of left over fries. Yep, I'm a bum!  It was delish! The employees then ended up taking Slow Jam and I out and treating us all night. Pizza, beer and hot tubs!    The $7 all you can eat breakfast this morning at the hostel was incredible. And once again, very hard to leave a place like this but it's a perfect day so it's time to get the legs moving.    The plan was to hike 14 miles this afternoon into a nice shelter on a pond. But every day now is getting more exciting as I'm close to the end of this trip. With the exception of a quick dip mid afternoon, I just couldn't stop moving and ended up doing 19 miles.

It is a relatively flat stretch and the most remote section on the entire Trail. Please bear with me on the journaling for the next 5 days. I do have a better chance of getting out than most because of Verizon. Everyone who has Sprint or AT&T has been told that they will have no internet or phone at all until reaching Baxter State Park 5 to 7 days away. When I'm on top of the small peaks or in an open section of trail I will give it my best shot to get on Trailjournals. I will be keeping a handwritten account through the entire wilderness so if I have to post five or six days worth I will remember my daily events. Here we go!!    Got dropped off at the trailhead around noon but forgot my poles at the hostile so had to drive back and try it again with the second group at 2 o'clock.

Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546905,"As I headed into the Hundred Mile Wilderness yesterday I listened closely to the fading traffic of Maine Highway 13. Probably going to be very quiet this week. It appears I will end this trip the same way I began it, alone. Slow Jam had his mind set on zeroing yesterday in Monson but after already being there 24 hours and having such a beautiful hiking day weather wise, I could not see staying there any longer. My goal is to hike at a slightly slower pace than usual and to make sure I get to my tenting spot early enough to have a good fire.    The five and a half days of food I'm carrying is very heavy but I ate as much as possible last night and again for breakfast this morning. Obviously eating all the heaviest foods 1st. Already heard of two hikers who did not bring enough food and went the last day and a half with nothing.
 Running into more day and week hikers than I expected. This is a very popular area for a lot of young adventures as they can come out here and test themselves against the Wilderness for a 100-mile week in the woods. Something like the Long Trail which is 100 miles in Vermont. Also noticed an increase in day hikers there. It's 12 noon and as I blog today I'm watching the hawks  overhead. They seemed to just float in mid-air riding the warm thermals. It's been a common occurrence throughout the trail when I get to a Mountaintop. Very enjoyable watching them. Time to hike on there  is still 8 hours of daylight ahead.    Seems like a very long day for only 19 grueling miles. Set up my tent 5 feet from the trail and once again had mixed emotions about finishing. Everyone is hiking their own hike and no one really cares what the other is doing. It's not a bad thing it's just life. It reinforces how important family really is. It's obvious that no one cares like family. And I'm anxious to get back to mine.","Wilson Valley Shelter.

After talking a few minutes I found out they started one day after me on April 2nd. Unbelievable for he is 70 and she is 65 years old. Their key to success was taking no zero days at all. They trucked along at 12 to 14 miles a day. As you know I probably took 20 zero days. Happy with that decision.    I am on the last mountain top of the trip except for the big one! A small group of us up here think we can see Katahdin way off in the distance. From all the pictures I've seen I'd say that's it. It sure looks like a lot longer than four days away.    Now it's decision time. The one and only stop of civilization in the Hundred Mile Wilderness is White River Landing. This is where you can ring a bell from shore and a Gentleman will come out on his boat, pick you up and bring you to his island where he has set up a hiker hostel. I've crunched the numbers and looked at my guidebook. I would jump at this opportunity any other time on the trip as it sounds like a great adventure. But it would set me back a whole day and I don't want to be anywhere near Baxter State Park on Labor Day weekend. This is a tough one.    I have decided to press on to Katahdin.

The red tailed squirrels are everywhere and the closer we get to the state park the more aggressive they are becomeing. People are climbing Katahdin with holes in their tents, their backpacks and their food bags. So I took extra precautions by triple bagging everything. Then sleeping with my food. Lying my dirty socks on top of my food bag and then spraying the entire perimeter of my tent with bug spray. I met a couple of hikers who have had to beg for food in the wilderness because the squirrels ate everything. Even while hanging from a thin rope, barebag style. The thing that caused me to lose the most sleep last night was a completely different sound than I'm used to out here. Moose! It sounded like the Clydesdales were doing circles around my tent. I was too afraid to look outside but every time I yelled, slapped the side of my tent and shined the headlamp it seemed to temporarily scare them away. After being awakened 3 times by these extremely large creatures I finally got to sleep.    It's noon time and I'm pleased to announce the trail is as easy or easier than promised. Therefore I'm shooting for a 30 + mile day. The anticipation of finishing is rivaling that of the week before I left my home in March. This time I can channel my energy towards Katahdin. After all we have become hiking machines being out here so long. I never would have thought It would be possible to hike 30 miles in a day and now I'm looking to try to do even more. This is definitely the easiest 50 miles of the entire AT. Having a quick lunch on Mud Pond and it's off to see how far I can get today.    Disappointed to say that the 30 mile day was not in the cards. Just as I was approaching a shelter it started to rain. That's it for the day. 25mi by 5:00 will be cutting it close for the last few days. But I really don't have much choice.

Late into the evening a strange noise woke me out of a sound sleep. Looking over to my left I could barley make out Mother Goose packing up in complete darkness. When I asked him what time it was he whispered back, 4:15. That's when I made the decision to go for the big day. So I sarted packing along with him. Ate my last danish and washed it down with a cup of adrenaline. We were off and running with our headlamps on.  As I was keeping up with this young, fast hiker for the first 8 miles told me it was going to be a good day.    I was on a mission.

At a very leisurely pace I got five miles closer to the Big K. It would be my last night alone in my tent out in the middle of the wilderness.    Woke up this morning and floated on air 5 miles into Katahdin Stream Campground where I registered with the ranger as thru-hiker 496 northbounder. As promised after two easy miles this mountain proved to be one of the hardest climbs of the entire Trek. Downright scary. This journey ended with a two-mile massive rock scramble that almost broke my phone as I was crawling on my stomach. Then I saw a large group of people up ahead. There was the sign. This wasn't going to be pretty. As I reached out to touch the Katahdin marker I had to walk away twice to wipe the two small streams coming from my face. It was over. I made it. The hardest thing I've ever done in my life physically and mentally. And that's an understatement. There were only two other thru hikers at the summit and the other 25 people were all day hikers. As a young man saw my contorted face and red eyes he yelled to the crowd ""let's give these three people a round of applause for their 2000 mile adventure"". Everyone clapped and brought tears to our thru hiker eyes once again.    The climb down was one of the most painful 2 hours of this hike. I had not done any hills in the last week and going down this very steep mountain my knees where in excruciating pain. And now the storybook ending to what was once just a dream of mine. Like most of the other thru-hikers I had no idea how I was going to get home. I was one of the lucky ones who only had 300 miles to get home while others had to travel cross-country. The plan was to stay at the AT hostel in Millinocket Maine with 35 other finished thru hikers and celebrate. The next morning they would drop us off at a bus station in Midway, take us to Bangor Maine where everyone would fly, take a bus or a train home. But there would be one last awesome act of Trail Magic for this lucky thru hiker. As I literally stepped on the exit road from Baxter State Park, Mother Goose and I stuck out our thumbs and the first car that came by stopped. He was excited to pick us up and told us he would bring us to Millinocket for the night. As we approached the ranger station to check out of the park the driver turned around to me and said ""hey the car in back of us has New Hampshire license plates"". That's all I needed to hear. I jumped out of the car and as I leaned over to the driver he rolled the window down and started talking before I could. You're the thru-hiker who was crying at the top of the mountain, he stated. These three young men from New Hampshire had just went on a 7 day trip hiking the 100-mile wilderness. Would you like a ride? We're going to Concord New Hampshire. They decided it was close enough to bring me to the front door of my home, unbelievable! The entire 5 hour ride home I just kept pinching myself.    I had them drop me off down the street from my home and then called my wife as I approached. She was happy to hear my voice and after a couple of minutes asked me where I was. She had no idea I even summited Katahdin yet .I told her to come to the front door of the house.Thought she was going to faint as her knees buckled. The rest is history.    I sincerely want to thank everyone who wrote to me or followed my adventure. You have no idea what an important part of the hike you actually were.

Never ended up using any first aid equipment. (Lucky). Food Bag weighed around 4 pounds, most others were double.    A few items that I discarded.    Sunglasses. ( unless you're trying to look cool in town these are completely useless and actually a liability with all the shadows and shade you are hiking in everyday)    Umbrella. (What was I thinking?)    Packtowl. (Never used it once.. Carried it almost the entire trip.) Bug head net.( used it one time and it was hot, hard to breathe and hard to see through. Better off just spraying yourself.    3rd pair of socks.You can usually get 2-3 days out of one pair. Also have lot of opportunities to rinse out second pair during the day    No bug spray needed until after Harpers Ferry (halfway point). This might vary with the rain each year.
    TIPS FROM THE TRAIL.    #1 Most of the Church Hostels are a must stay. (all of them are donation based and usually 5 or 10 dollars does the trick. Often u sleep in the basement rec hall with plenty of space. T.V. laundry, shower, and internet r common with a great central location in town. They all have a no alcohol policy to ensure a good nights sleep.)    # 2 Buy a small Backpack.(This will force u to keep packweight down. I still maintain packweight was a main reason for my success.If you get a big pack u WILL fill it!)    #3 Triple check your entire pack before leaving town. (this is where I lost most of my stuff including my fleese jacket and hiking pants.)When in town keep all your things togeather or in a corner of a room. Once u start spreading things out u will lose them. I ALAWAYS checked my 2 side pockets whenever I went anywhere for my wallet and phone. Sometimes multiple times per day.    #4 A poncho worked much better for me than a rain jacket. (Not only can u save $100 but your goal is not to keep yourself dry but to keep your backpack and contents dry. Hikers started buying 1 dollar ponchos when they saw how efficient it was).    #5 Always insert a heavy duty trash bag inside your pack first. (Even if they say your pack is waterproof or water resistant. Never got my things wet the entire trip.)    #6 I cut socks in half and slipped the top half over my shoulder straps.(Was told many times how it was a great idea but never saw anyone do it. Some hikers had rashes, scrapes, and the pattern of the straps embedded into their skin. My homemade shoulder pads worked awesome for me. Its not a fashion show out there. Whatever gets you to Katahdin!)    #7 Truly believe jumping in water everyday and rinsing my shirt off everyday was a huge part of my good health on the trail. ( as we all know your skin is the largest organ of your body. Keeping it clean, free of the abrasive salt, cleansing those pores of dirt was huge. Not to mention feeling great during the day and when it was time to go to bed. Many hikers had rashes, clogged pores, sores, and used to brag about all the salt lines and holes on their shirts. Lots of young hikers went a week without any hygiene multiple times throughout their hike. I changed out my hiking shirt 3 times usually for $2 at a goodwill store or for free in a hiker box.)
 No Lyme disease, no giardia, no noro virus, not even a sniffle in 5 months. Not bad for the old man who saw hundreds of sick hikers on the trail.    Knees r at 70%. Both feet r still numb, middle toes.    Next Post @ the end of the month.",,R & R In the Whites with family.,"Sep 05, Mon",0
Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550568,"Wow! I've been home for 6 weeks and it seems like forever. My knees are at about 95%. But my middle toes on both feet are still numb and only improving slightly. It now all feels like a dream. Hard to believe I was sleeping in the pitch dark forest for the last 5 months.     One of the most common questions asked has been "" Are you a different person""? Have you changed in any way""? My response would be that I do appreciate what I have more than I ever did before. Two great children and a wonderful, loving wife. Who by the way approved of me leaving for 5 months while she held down the fort. How much more in life could you ask for?      I'm very much enjoying being home with my family but with a type A personality and adventure calling I believe chapter two is in order. The Trans-America trail is a 4300 mile bicycle trail across the country. No, I don't own a bicycle and have really never ridden but it sounds like fun and covering 60 to 80 miles a day you can see more of this planet than traveling on foot. I'm hoping that trailjournals will allow me to document my next journey on this unbelievably great site. Departure date would be May 1st 2018. Because this bike trip is so spread out and contains less people than a typical thru hike I wouldn't mind a partner or two tagging along. Splitting costs at Motels @ Hotels and just sharing the entire trip with someone sounds like more fun than traveling alone. Am very easy to get along with and a master of just going with the flow. If anybody out there is interested in flying with the Terodactyle across country, get in touch with me thru my guestbook. Man, women, young or old. Doesn't matter. The average time it takes to complete this journey is 10-12 weeks. I'm flexible and like a thru-hike there will be plenty of opportunity to be by yourself. Just the fact that you know someone who is a day behind or ahead of you is comforting. Looking forward to another trip of a lifetime. Google crazyguyonabike.com for more information.     As much as I miss the trail life I'm not sure how much more I could have taken. My body took some real punishment. I'm counting on this bike trip being much easier. With a 60% success rate, I'm looking forward to some downhill coasting. Ha,ha,ha.",,HOME,"Oct 17, Mon",0
Terodactyle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553257,"It's hard to believe it's been 4 months out of the woods. Hardly a day goes by that a thought from the trail doesn't zip thru my head. Whenever I start to complain about going to the mailbox for the paper or having to rise from my bed (8:00am). I immediately think back to my adventure. Poping out of my sleeping bag at 5am, freezing and packing up my tent, hungry just to get moving and start another 20 mile day. I am now the exact weight I was before the hike. After 2 weeks of rest, rejoined the gym to make sure those pounds put back on were quality ones. Truly believe I feel the best I have in 20 years. Now when I tell my kids they can accomplish ANYTHING if they want it bad enough, they look at me different. They believe it knowing how hard this trip was and also how much fun it was. Each day that has gone by my toes have gotten better. Within a few more weeks will be 110%. I added the 10% because my right knee feels better than it did before I left in April.      My trail friendships are greatly missed. Also feel I should walk at least 1 hr a day. 2 hrs is better. Never felt like this before.    Would I ever Thru-Hike again??? If I'm still around in 20 yrs, YES!! Would love to be the 75 year old who is having fun on the trail. Of course the hike would be much different. No 20+ miles days hiking. Less beer drank in town. And 6 months on the trail instead of 5. Also go at a slower pace. Just remember out there. IT CAN B DONE IF U WANT IT BAD ENOUGH.    See everyone in 2 years when I journal my Trans America Trail bike trip. Thanks again, bye (for now).   
     *****It is now 2 weeks before Christmas (2017) and I would just like to wish the class of 2018 GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!*****
     **** It is now  Summer 2018. My bike has arrived and the planning has started for the Transamerica Trail. May 15 next Spring.
     **** It is now March 1st 2019. Looks like this Bike thing is happening. You can follow along on the #1 Bike site crazyguyonabike.com. It's time to ROLL!!    **** It is now Feb 2020. The bike trip has been changed to the Katy Trail. It's the longest rails to trails bike path in America. I feel a lot safer with NO automobile traffic. I will be doing a yo-yo so it will be a 500mi trip. Leaving April 28th. Will journal. Very excited!",,Patriots vs Dolfins Game,"Dec 31, Sat",0
