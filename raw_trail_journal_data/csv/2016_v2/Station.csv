Station,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520421,"I've always loved stories that begin with a map. A good map is like an invitation into another world; few things can spark curiosity and engage imagination so quickly and thoroughly. So today I begin my story with a map of the Appalachian Trail.The AT is said to be the longest hiking trail in the world, stretching roughly 2,189 miles over what are thought to be the oldest mountains on Earth. As you can probably tell, there is some controversy about these claims, but the facts are that the Trail is very long at 2,000+ miles and the Appalachian Mountains are older than the Atlantic Ocean. Beginning at Springer Mountain in Georgia the AT traverses fourteen states before finally arriving at the legendary Mount Katahdin in Maine.In the Spring of 2016 I will set out on the adventure of a lifetime: attempting to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. ""Attempt"" is the right word to use, as 70% of hikers who begin in Georgia never make it to Katahdin. In his book A Walk In The Woods, Bill Bryson writes that 20% drop out in the first week, mostly claiming that it wasn't what they expected. There are some who say that it's better to not consider failure an option, but I think keeping the difficulty in mind helps me prepare for the challenges ahead. Besides, if you are going to fail at something, it might as well be something spectacular.  But I do not intend to fail. I plan to pass every white blaze, walk every step, and have the adventure of a lifetime. 
For the map lovers among you, here are a couple more detailed maps of the AT: PDF from the Nation Park ServicePopular one on Google Maps",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Sat",0

Especially when that box holds some key element to your upcoming adventure. Even something as seemingly inconsequential and ridiculous as a little, bright orange trowel (poop shovel!) can get me excited as I unpack it. It's like the holidays never ended as equipment has been arriving every few days. I did have some hiking stuff already (or so I thought) and my family were kind and generous to me this Christmas, but I still had a ton of stuff to buy. I'm slowly but surely filling out the gear list in the sidebar, hesitant to find out the final total of dollars spent.For the last few months I've been immersed in the world of hiking gear, spending hours and hours researching, debating, and reading reviews. Outdoor Gear Lab was a tremendous resource, as were the conversations on WhiteBlaze.net and the AT community on Reddit. Pictured here is my nearly complete assortment of gear. At this moment I believe the only things left to buy are a better dry bag for my sleeping bag and a food bag. Food and fuel aren't pictured here, and the water bladder is empty, so there's another fifteen plus pounds added to this.When you are going to be a turtle for six months, carrying all of your possessions on your back, weight becomes a key issue and every ounce counts. I've been using LighterPack.com to keep track of everything and to keep my base weight down. My list is here. I was shooting for a base weight under 15 lbs but when winter finally showed up I decided to ensure I would be warm enough so my clothing weight creeped up. I've also noticed other people listing the same items I have with lower weight numbers. I just used the shipping weights I found online, maybe I should go find a scale.There is a vocal ultralight movement online, and while I went as light as possible with my choices I decided early on that I wanted a real tent, which precludes me from joining the ranks of the UL. Sleeping in a suspended cocoon of a hammock or in an open tarp tent for over a hundred nights didn't appeal to me. I may feel differently once I've been lugging my gear for a while and I can pitch my tent with just the ground sheet and rain fly, sending the main part home, but I still think I'll sleep better in an enclosed space, even if the walls are paper-thin nylon. I don't want to wake up with a raccoon or something scarier sharing my sleeping bag. It also seemed nice to be able to sit up straight.When the tent arrived, a Christmas gift from my awesome grandparents, I did a little dance. It was the first big thing I got and it made this trip real to me. I'm a grown-ass man but like a little kid I pushed my bed over to make room and set up my new tent, using books to hold down the guylines. Once I got a sleeping pad from my lovely sister and my quilt arrived I spent the night camping out in my apartment, dreaming of the woods. Since then my pile of stuff has grown to the large assortment you see here and I am feeling very ready to hit the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Sun",0
Station,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520689,"After a couple months of Winter laziness binge watching House of Cards, Rick and Morty, and Game of Thrones, it's time to get ready. I have been getting ready in the sense of doing research, learning to hang a bear bag, getting my affairs in order, and gearing up, but sitting on a couch with a laptop can only do so much to prepare you for trekking up and down mountains full time for half a year. I live in Long Beach, NY, and while this barrier island doesn't offer much in topography, it does have a beautiful 2.2 mile boardwalk and plenty of weather. On Monday I did a loop of the boardwalk to test out my New Balance trail runners and clocked a bit over five miles from my apartment. Not big miles but just right to squeeze a long walk into the end of a busy day. On Tuesday I loaded up my Osprey Atmos, even filling my water reservoir to the top, and set out. The bag felt great, hugging my hips and spreading the weight evenly across my back and shoulders. I expected to be uncomfortable but once I got used to the novel feeling of being spooned by a backpack while walking I was fine. I even spent an hour on the phone with my sister talking about my upcoming adventure on the AT with no huffing and puffing on my end. Last night I was tired after a long day at work and a storm had rolled in, but I peeled myself off the couch and put on my rain gear. I still need to get a larger pack cover so I left my bag at home. One of my favorite parts of living by the beach is experiencing the ocean in all types of weather across all the seasons. I always associated it with sunny summer days, but the Atlantic is always there, churning away on cold Winter nights. With the rain coming down, the spray coming off the ocean, and the boardwalk all but deserted, it was otherworldly. I took the picture above very quickly to keep my phone dry. My rain pants and shell kept me dry and I didn't freeze or overheat, and with my hood wrapped around the brim of my hat my glasses stayed relatively clear. My shoes got pretty soggy but they were dry this morning. I spent most of the walk on the phone with my friend Powers, planning out how he'll drive up from Florida to meet me for a night in Neel Gap next month because he's a champ. Next month...crazy.Tonight I'm going to strap on my bag and climb the stairs in my building for an hour or two. That's sure to be more of a workout than my nightly strolls. My neighbors might think I'm nuts, and they'll probably be right. On Saturday my buddy Alex might be joining me for a Winter day hike up in Harriman.",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Thu",0
Station,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521564,"One month from today (2/22/16) I will be on the trail. On Sunday 3/20, the first day of Spring, I'll fly into Atlanta, take a train to the north side of the city, and the fine folks at the Hiker Hostel will pick me up and I'll spend the night with them. I thought I was being smart by hitting Atlanta on a day when a lot of people would be starting the trail, (weekends are popular and the first day of Spring is very popular,) but the Hiker Hostel was almost fully booked. I'll be spending the night on a ""luxurious overflow futon,"" which will also be the name of my next album. On Monday morning they'll drop me off at the approach trail, 8.8 miles and almost 2,000 feet of elevation from the top of Springer Mountain. When I first learned about these extra miles I was actually upset. It seemed a great injustice that the first day of hiking didn't actually count. But I quickly realized how irrational I was being, setting out to spend six months in the wilderness covering 2,190 miles yet being bent out of shape by a little extra. So I am going to enjoy my hike up the 604 step staircase to the top of Amicalola Falls on my way to Springer. Plus there is something very appealing to waking up at mile zero on my first day. The plan is to start slow, covering 8 or 9 miles a day. For those following at home: Tuesday night I'll stay at (or more likely pitch my tent near) Hawk Mountain Shelter. Wednesday: Gooch Mountain Shelter. Thursday will be a relatively easy day to Lance Creek camp site, then Friday I hustle over the ominously named Blood Mountain, the highest peak in the Georgia section of the AT, to stumble into Neel Gap and my first taste of civilization in five days. My buddy John is driving up from Jacksonville to meet me on Friday, because he is a champion and we were originally under the impression that the state of Georgia was a bit smaller than it really is. For his sake I hope to take make it to Neel Gap in time to shower and do laundry before he gets there. Any planning beyond that is pointless, as much as I'd like to know where I'll be when. There are so many variables like terrain, weather, and how I'm feeling that even this modest plan was tricky. The only way I could be confident was to commit to going slow and taking my time, which is probably a good idea starting out. This isn't a race, it's a marathon. Actually it's 84 marathons with 30 to 40 pounds of stuff strapped on my back. AWOL has a good day by day plan that I included in the links page, but even he has three different versions depending on pace and concedes he can't account for zero mile days. I'm doing my best to embrace the freedom and flexibility of figuring things out on the fly, but it's going to take some adjustment.I've got plenty of stuff to take care of in the next month; getting all my stuff packed up and into storage, selling some furniture I'm not keeping, tying up loose ends at work, and trying to see everybody before I go. But I am getting very antsy. The mountains are calling and I must go...",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Mon",0
