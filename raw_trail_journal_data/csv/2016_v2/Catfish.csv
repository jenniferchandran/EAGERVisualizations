Catfish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478861,"I am in the initial planning phase of an approximately month-long section hike on the southern section of the AT beginning in early May 2016. My tentative plan is to leave from Springer around the first week of May and come off the trail in early June somewhere between Erwin, TN and Damascus, VA. I realize that is a fairly broad geographic window, but as I said, I'm only in the initial and tentative planning stage. I will set specific dates/locations as my planning progresses, as I don't intend to get on the trail and just hike until I'm ready to stop. I like spontaneity, but not quite that much.I don't have a great deal of backpacking experience, but I've done a fair bit of day hiking and am looking to increase my backpacking experience and knowledge in the next few months. I am an avid cyclist and runner, so I'm starting with what I consider a very good cardiovascular fitness base, but have decided to increase my weightlifting regimen over the next few months to better balance my upper and lower body. Some people skip leg day; I tend to skip chest and arm days. My collection of backpacking gear will need to grow significantly in the next few months. I have researched my options and understand my needs/abilities well, so really I'm down to the purchasing phase. I won't be extreme, but I hope to get my gear into the ""ultralight"" range. However, I will sacrifice some weight for frugality.I do have a question for anyone with AT experience - Will my early May departure cause me to spend most of my days alone? I can't (job) and don't want to leave with the big NOBO crowd in March/April, but I hope to interact and hike with folks from time to time. If anyone is interested in possibly departing around the same time, I'd love to discuss our possible compatibility.As I said, I want to expand my knowledge and backpacking experience over the next few months. To that end, I will take a few 2-4 day trips this winter and coming spring. I'm in Mississippi, which offers little in the way of rigorous hiking, so I don't mind road-tripping to get in a good trip. If you're interested in meeting up (and possibly providing a little education), please let me know.Lastly, I uploaded a picture to include with this entry to familiarize myself with the process. It is a picture of me at Big Bluff along the Buffalo National River in Arkansas.

Catfish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478862,"In researching a multi-day trip on the AT, I've read relatively unsurprising (and great) advice. People have varied ideas on gear, tactics, etc., but for the most part the ""what you can expect"" advice is sort of...what I expected. The exception, however, is regarding the distance one should plan to cover in the first several days of a northbound trip. What I've read more than anything else are warnings of overestimating one's mileage ability over the first few days. I know the Georgia mountains have significant elevation gains/drops, but I just don't see myself hiking as few as 7-8 miles a day for a week, which is what I've read (from multiple reliable sources) a relatively fit individual should expect to do. I anticipate about twice that distance every day, including my first few, and don't at this point plan to start low and increase after a week. Should I be paying more attention to these warnings? 
Thanks.

Catfish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478863,"As I plan my approximately month-long AT section hike beginning at Springer in May 2016, I am considering just how far up the trail I want to go. I have the desire to hike at least as far north as Erwin, TN and the flexibility to add additional days to make it as far as Damascus, VA. For those of you that have hiked the Erwin to Damascus section, what are your opinions regarding that section? I know the tendency is to say ""the more the better,"" but please, if possible, suspend that idea and help me decide if that section is a MUST DO. Thanks.- Catfish",,How far in a month?,"Dec 07, Sun",0
Catfish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481078,"In early January 2015 one of my best friends (let's call him Todd) and I made a last-minute, short overnight trek from Carver's Gap to Overmountain Shelter and back. This was my first time on the A.T., and it was every bit as fun and beautiful as I imagined. The trip presented a few challenges, some man-made and some natural, but none were too difficult to overcome and I learned a lot in the process.Not having a full assortment of gear, Todd let me borrow most of the gear I needed, including a heavy, yet perfectly capable pack he bought back in the late 90's, his wife's narrow-shouldered sleeping bag, and a few other odds and ends. We drove from Charlotte, NC to Carver's Gap on New Year's afternoon, arriving at the trailhead around dusk. It was sprinkling rain, the temperature was around 35°, and the winds were howling (I'd guess 20-25mph). We were properly clothed, so this didn't present much of a problem. We hiked up the first incline, met the only other hikers we'd see that day within the first 1/4 mile, and found ourselves on the first of three balds within about 3/4 of a mile. It was getting dark, so the scenery wasn't great, but the winds were whipping around up on top enough for us to employ the old lean-into-it method, which was fun. As we entered the thick rhododendron brush that shelters the trail around these balds, the trail was iced over from the recent rain and freezing temperatures. We had to slow down, take a lot of ""tester"" steps, and straddle the iciest parts to keep from taking a dive - again, pretty fun. Once we got through the balds the ice was only patchy and didn't present anymore challenges. As the sun went completely down behind the thick cloud cover we were surprised at the amount of natural light we had from a full moon reflecting off the clouds and fog. I didn't turn my headlamp on until long after the sun went down. We passed one shelter (Stan Murray) and entered some heavily wooded area as we approached Overmountain Shelter. Once we arrived, we built a fire, had a little dinner, and talked about all sorts of stuff until after midnight. Around 2:00 am I made the decision to add some sort of pillow to my gear list, but otherwise slept about like one would expect to in a drafty barn in a tiny sleeping bag in 30° weather. We woke up the next morning, had a little breakfast, made an obnoxious entry in the shelter log, and retraced our steps back to Carver's Gap. It was still windy and sprinkling rain, but we were able to take in the winter beauty of that section of trail. The picture here shows how great the colors are even in January. We made it back to Carver's Gap around 11:00 and headed back to Charlotte. All-in-all, a great little trip.
