Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517649,"I guess it really all began when I was a kid. Long before I ever heard of the Appalachian Trail, I loved the woods...I always felt a strange sense of peace and belonging. Climbing trees, making forts, and pretending to be on some great adventure are some of the best memories of my childhood. About 16 years ago, I read A Walk in the Woods and was introduced to the A.T. for the first time. I've been hooked ever since. I have longed to have the opportunity to complete a thru-hike, but wondered if the circumstances of life would ever allow it. On October 28, 2015, with a simple text from my dad, my dream started to become a reality. ""I'm in,"" is all he had to say. The ""Negotiator"" and I are planning to start on April 1, 2016. It is hard to contain how excited I am, but the planning is helping to channel some of that energy. Dreams really do come true!On cloud 9,",,View Entry,"Nov 23, Mon",0
Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518161,"Who knew trail gear took so long to research and decide upon? Negotiator and I have been reading all we can to make the best decisions with regards to gear. We were able to purchase all of the ""big 4"" (tent, sleeping bag, pack, and shoes) last week online thanks to Black Friday/Christmas sales. We are heading to the famous A.T. outfitter, Mountain Crossings, at Neel Gap today to purchase the remaining items and to get some much needed wisdom and advice from the staff there which are all thru-hikers. I have tons of questions for them. I can't believe we only have 117 more days until we begin!Still on cloud 9,",,Getting Ready!,"Dec 06, Sun",0

It was a beautiful drive to Blairsville and Zack ""Blueyes"" Finney was such a phenomenal help in giving advice and helping with choosing exactly what we needed. Now to focus on the best way to pack and what we'll be eating...I'm a pescatarian so it'll be a little more challenging than for most.

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518414,"One has to expect that most everyone will never understand your reasons for wanting to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. Sometimes, even listening to yourself sounds a bit unconvincing. However, that unexplainable yearning will not silence itself in my heart, even after having someone I look up to and admire offer no real interest or support, only focusing on the complications of this desire I've had for almost 16 years. I cannot lie, their response saddened me, but more than anything it solidified the peace God has given me about pursuing my dream.

We had some special trail magic thanks to my friend Lisa when we got to Springer Mtn., the actual start of the A.T., and also at about mile 6 thanks to the North Georgia Hiking Club. We hiked a total of 15.3 miles to Hawk Mtn. Shelter. We met several other thru-hikers and all were really nice.

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526207,"Day 2 started off great. We had rain last night, but our gear held up well, and the strong winds dried everything off before we had to pack up and head out. We tented next to a sweet young girl named Summer who is from PA. The hike today was tough in the morning. Sassafras and Justus were challenging mountains, but the hike from Justus to Gooch Mtn. was pretty pleasant winding around a beautiful creek for a few miles. We had lunch there w/a fun group of young guys we had played leap frog with all day that were laid off last November. We finished our day by hiking to Woody Gap for a total of 13 miles. There, we had some more trail magic and met one of my student's parents, Tom Rector, who along w/his wife Paula, invited us to stay at their beautiful cabin that is on the Trail. We had 5 Star accommodations in a gorgeous setting! As if that wasn't enough, Tom cooked us a gourmet meal of grilled lemon pepper salmon, cheesy rice, veggies, salad, and sourdough bread. Tom is an AT section hiker, so he had lots of great information and advice to share. We ended the evening with some amazing brownies that definitely were the perfect ending to a wonderful day on the Trail. ??","Mount Katahdin

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526366,"Day 3 - We headed out of Woody Gap well rested and clean.  Preaching Rock had some beautiful views in the early morning. We had Blood Mountain in our sights and reached the summit around 1:30 pm. The views were amazing! After our hike down, the famous Mountain Crossings was waiting for us with frozen pizza and Diet Coke. We decided to stay at the hostel, because it's one of the ""musts"" to do on the Trail. We had a great time with Teradactyl, Seadog, Rucker, Golden, Fargone, Daniel, Lobster, and Walmart. Didn't sleep so well though as the symphony of snoring was quite out of control. ??","Mount Katahdin

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526651,"Day 4 - Got an early start at around 7:30 am and it was a good thing because we had Levelland, Cowrock, and Poor Mountains to cross in addition to Sheep Rock Top. We had a great view off Cowrock while eating our snack.  We stopped at Low Gap Shelter for water after 11 1/2 miles and because it was only 1:30, we decided to keep going...and going we did...a total of 18.8 miles...I thought I killed my dad on day 4. I have to say it was both our ideas to keep going, but I did think the next shelter was only 5 miles, not 7. We hobbled into Blue Mountain Shelter and hunkered down for a windy, cold night.","Neel Gap

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526655,"Day 5 - We woke to the most beautiful sunrise and the realization that we survived the night after our marathon hike yesterday. Later in the day I realized I am no longer human, I am now a mountain goat. I also realized something else today while hiking over Rocky Mountain (GA not TN) and Tray Mountain...mountains have friends and they are called knobs. I hate knobs. For some reason they are usually nestled on both sides of their friend Mountain, but the builders of the AT decided it was best to just go straight up them instead of nice switchbacks like those of the mountains. In fact, I wrote a poem to communicate just how much I don't like them:Knobs are sneaky, knobs are bad.Beware of them or you'll be sad. There's always another, on that you can bet, I haven't found one that I've liked yet. There are the views and the crest, but going down them is the best.Despite the knobs, we had another high mileage day of 15.5, I saw my first butterfly, walked through the most beautiful rhododendron grove, and heard my first owl conversation while drifting off to sleep.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527139,"Day 6 - Cardinal Rule #1 when it comes to food on the Trail - never leave food or wrappers in your tent or pack. I left trail mix in my pack, and thus, had a little friend visit me. ?? Fortunately, it only chewed a hole in the pocket on my hip belt and not my actual pack and somehow got in w/o chewing a hole in my tent. We hiked 3.6 miles to Dick's Creek Gap and got a ride to Top of Georgia Hostel to get our 2nd maildrop, do laundry, and take a shower. Veggie pizza and ginger ale made for a great lunch. Afterwards, we got back on the Trail and hiked another 4.5 miles to Plumorchard Gap Shelter. We tented near the shelter and talked to a really nice hiker named Rainbow Express that had hiked the Trail in 1980 and had returned to hike it w/his son. We also met Ladybug and 'A Jude...two nice ladies from FL. We had thunderstorms overnight, but our tents held up well and kept us dry. Getting excited about having one state down tomorrow. NC...here we come!","Deep Gap Shelter

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527143,"Day 7 - One state down, 13 to go! We made it to NC pretty early and she welcomed us w/gale force winds and an almost vertical 900' hike up Couthouse Bald. We hiked a total of 12.2 miles to Standing Indian Shelter and had to practically run the last mile because it began sleeting really hard and we decided to try and get a spot inside the shelter since the weather report was calling for more heavy winds/sleet through the night. Thankfully, we did get a spot and met some other really nice thru-hikers...Mike and Stephanie from Milwaukee and Bunyan from Mercer, PA. Rucker, who we met at Mountain Crossings was also there and we were really glad to see her again. The weather was so bad, we all fixed dinner as fast as we could and got in our sleeping bags around 6. The shelter had a tin roof and it was downright comical at times how loud the sleet and wind were. Dad raised up out of his sleep at one point and said, ""I think we made a wrong turn and went to Alaska!""","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527169,"Day 8 - Well we aren't in Alaska, but we did wake up to the most beautiful snowfall! The hike up and over Standing Indian was breathtaking and reminded me of visiting Santa in a ""winter wonderland"" as a child. It was our highest summit yet at 5435'. We hiked a total of 16.2 miles, which were relatively pleasant until we reached Albert Mountain fire tower. It was a very SCARY near vertical rock climb to the top where I found myself throwing my poles up ahead several times and crawling on my hands and knees up the wet muddy rocks. Negotiator and I both made it safely and had a spectacular view from the top. We stayed at Long Branch Shelter, which was a very nice double-decker. Rucker and Bunyan were both there so we all shared the loft. Bunyan and Negotiator made a nice fire we all enjoyed before heading to bed to weather another cold windy night.","Long Branch Shelter

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527226,"Day 9 - We woke to another cold windy day, but Franklin, NC was in our sights and only 7.3 miles away. We got to Winding Stair Gap on US 64 around 11:30 to meet our own personal trail angel, one Lisa Coley, but there were a whole bunch of others, too, from Connecting Point Church in Athens, GA. The fire they had built felt wonderful and we enjoyed some Sprite and Pringles as we chatted w/the angels and other hikers. Lisa treated us to an awesome Mexican feast and then took us to Walmart for a few things we needed. She also provided clothes and pjs for us to wear while washing our clothes and some additional toiletries so we could feel ""normal"" for a day...needless to say, once we reached the hotel and showered, we felt grateful and were so appreciative of her thoughtfulness. Later in the afternoon, we went through our packs, dried out our tents, washed clothes, and, of course, watched the Masters. ?? For dinner we decided to go to a local place called Mulligan's because we figured we could continue watching golf. We had to call a ""shuttle"" and that proved to be quite interesting. Our driver was an elderly gentleman who was adorable. He was in a 4-door Jeep and gave us lots of info about the area. He also had section hiked the entire AT back in the 70's. He agreed to pick us up after dinner and that's when the fun began. Now, being elderly, he did a great job of driving slow and watching carefully, however, about 2 mins into the ride home he took a turn at a red light and here was the conversation: Driver - ""Hey, am I okay over here?"" Me - ""No sir, we are on the wrong side of the road and there is traffic coming straight toward us."" Driver - ""Oh, oh, that's okay...we'll just do this..."" And we drove right over the concrete median in that Jeep and just like that, we were safely on our way home again. ?? (And we thought the Trail could be dangerous. ??) Not sure if the mountain air has effected our judgment, but we asked the same driver to pick us up in the morning to take us back to the the Trail. Overall, we had a wonderful afternoon/evening in Franklin and I sure am looking forward to sleeping in this bleach smelling, 4 pillowed hotel bed!","Long Branch Shelter

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527804,"Day 10 - Our adorable driver got us safely to Winding Stair Gap to begin our day. Because we didn't start until around 10, we decided to only try and get to Wayah Bald Shelter which was an 11 mile hike. We got to see our first two ""balds""...Siler Bald which was just a grassy hill and Wayah Bald which was nothing short of phenomenal. The Trail up to Wayah Bald took us on our first (other than crossing a road) paved part of the Trail. The views were simply breathtaking.","Franklin, NC
",Mount Katahdin,"Apr 10, Sun",11
Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527810,"Day 11 - Well that was quite the sleepless night. ?? Our shelter had mice and our other shelter mates were not the most considerate. Consequently, we got up at 5:30 am to get ready for our 16.5 mile hike to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). It was a tough hiking day, but as we descended down towards the NOC, I saw my first blooming Dogwood tree w/an AT blaze just before it. ?? We also saw another previous thru-hiker, forty-sixer, who we've seen almost every day on the Trail going southbound because he is supporting his wife, forty-sixer-2, on her first thru-hike. He is 73 yrs old, from Vermont, uses no poles, and moves like the wind! And such a nice man! We enjoyed a good meal at River's End Restaurant and were glad the storm held off until after dark.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527815,"Day 12 - The rain subsided around 10, so we headed out for our toughest opponent yet, Cheoah Bald, around 10:30. We had decided to stop at Sassafras Gap Shelter because of our late start, but we were feeling good and got there around 2:30, so we decided to just get it on over with and hike to Locust Cove Gap. The summit was difficult and unfortunately there were no views because of the looming clouds, but we at least got a photo by the sign. ?? We made it into camp about 5 pm and met some really nice section hikers from Greensboro, NC...an ER nurse, a trauma flight nurse, and a pharmacist...we were feeling mighty safe for once.

Negotiator and I both woke w/much anticipation about our destination today...Fontana Dam...the southern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We had a difficult 17 miles before us, but we were excited about the milestone. Along the way, we met Jane Owl, an avid hoop girl, her boyfriend Yoshi, and Burly from Lafayette, IN. We got to Fontana Village around 5 pm and neither one of us had cell svc to call a shuttle. Dad decided to try his hand...uh, thumb, at hitchhiking, but thankfully another hiker had already called a shuttle that was happy to take us to the lodge to get our next mail drop. We enjoyed some fried green tomatoes and pasta and got a nice hot shower. I'm excited to begin our journey thru the Smokies tomorrow!","Locust Cove Gap

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528927,"Days 14-18 - Great Smoky Mountains...you now have my utmost respect. Folks...it's been a hard 5 days. For us, it was difficult physically and mentally, coupled w/the fact we had no cell svc to be able to whine to our loved ones . On our first day, we got a late start because of laundry duty, so we only went 7.4 miles, but felt pretty cool walking across Fontana Dam. We camped at Birch Spring Gap and met a really nice hiker named Lucky. Day 15 is when the difficulties began. Because we had low mileage on Thurs., we decided to hike 17.2 miles to Derrick Knob Shelter...big mistake. Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mtn. were tough and there were 5 knobs ( waiting for us after that. Day 16 was better...we hiked 13.5 miles and made it over Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT at 6667'. We stayed the night at the beautiful Mt. Collins Shelter and met Older Dog who attempted a thru-hike last year and had lots of great tips. Day 17 we hiked 14.5 miles to Pecks Corner and got to see the famous Charlie's Bunion. Day 18 we hiked 12.6 miles to Cosby Knob Shelter where we ran into Papa Bear and Easy Tiger from Austin who are a father/son pair who actually had taken our picture for us on Cheoah Bald. The beauty kept us going...pictures just can never do it justice. In addition to the majestic mountain views, we saw spruces and firs, gorgeous wild flowers, and felt many times like we were walking through an enchanted forest in a storybook. However, we did see two snakes, but they scurried out of the way pretty quickly and it made me really happy that Negotiator leads the way on the Trail everyday!","Fontana Dam

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528948,"Day 19 - We officially exited the Great Smoky Mountains National Park today. It was beautiful to see the abundance of trees and flowers blooming as we hiked down into lower elevations. After 5 days out, we decided to stop at Standing Bear Hostel so we could shower and resupply our food for the 3 day hike to Hot Springs, NC. The staff was very nice, but it was quite a peculiar experience. I love that everything is on the honor system. You just write down what you buy and pay in an envelope when you leave...pretty crazy. We met several interesting hikers, too...Shawnagan, Sinatra, Nubs, and Seven. Papa Bear, Easy Tiger, and Tom (a great guy we met a couple of days ago) were also tenting there.

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529489,Day 20 - Shawnagan took us back to the Trail this morning and we headed toward Groundhog Creek Shelter. It was a long upward climb to Snowbird Mountain and when we reached the top we found this FAA tower that looked like a spaceship atop the grassy bald. Dad built a great fire and there were only a couple of other people tenting so it was a nice quiet night.

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529495,Day 21 - Max Patch is one of the most famous summits on the Trail. It was cleared for cattle years ago and is now maintained as a bald. Being in a pasture on the top of a mountain was pretty cool. I felt a bit like Maria in The Sound of Music w/o the snow caps in the background.  We had a marathon day of 23 miles and made it to Deer Park Shelter for the night. We woofed down our Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and went to bed dreaming of hiking into Hot Springs the next day.,"Groundhog Creek Shelter

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529499,"Day 22-23 - We excitedly awoke to get ready to hike down to town and see my hot man in Hot Springs.  We beat the rain and headed straight for the Smoky Mountain Diner for a good ol' Southern breakfast. Bill arrived about a half hour later...needless to say, I was one happy girl! After eating, we hit The Wash Tub to wash our clothes and I got to introduce Bill to several of our hiker friends. We stayed at the Mountain Magnolia Inn and it was so wonderful! There are several 100+ year old trees on the property including a chestnut, which is quite rare. The Iron Horse Station and Spring Creek kept us fed and we were able to resupply at Hillbilly Market and Bluff Mountain Outfitters. One bit of bad news we got upon arrival was that a 14.5 mile section of the Trail was closed due to a forest fire just north of Hot Springs and not expected to open for 4-7 days. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy is having hikers re-enter at Allen Gap so Bill is going to drop us off there in the morning so we can hit the Trail once again.","Deer Park Shelter

I would be lying if I said it was easy walking into those woods again. Walk we did, though, having no idea what rock fun we had ahead of us. Apparently, Howard, a master trail builder, who has since passed away, was quite fond of rocks and taking the Trail over them. Our book dubs it a ""strenuous"" section and I would absolutely agree! We made it unscathed and hiked to Jerry Cabin Shelter to tent for the night. I met a really nice lady named Big Deal from Vegas and Nature from Germany also ended up tenting there.

It was pasture-like at the top which was really beautiful. We also hiked quite a ways next to a barbed-wire fence which took me back to being in the country at my grandparents' house. I finally took a picture of these crazy little umbrella looking plants that I find so unique...I need to figure out the name.

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530455,"Day 26 - Tough day. It has been almost a month, and the schedule (5:30 am - 7 pm) of breaking down camp in the morning, hiking the needed mileage for the day, and setting up camp at night is taking its toll in that it saps every bit of energy and time so that the spiritual and peaceful experience I dreamed of on the Trail is getting further out of reach. We came across a monument today donated by the Moye family that saddened me greatly. Although the words themselves were very inspiring and heartfelt, it made me realize that thru-hiking the AT is more of a physical accomplishment given the nature of the time constraints and the mileage one must attain every day, and that my hopes and dreams about my hike on this beautiful Trail would never be realized.","Hogsback Ridge Shelter

Mustard Seed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530456,"Saying goodbye to the AT (for now) - In most ways, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world. Not only did I get the opportunity to pursue a 16 year old dream, I did so alongside my father. My AMAZING, SACRIFICIAL father. Negotiator led the way everyday, NEVER once complained about the difficult days and the bodily pain, was Water Filtration Chief...which I could write a book about how difficult it is to gather the needed water for drinking and cooking and THEN having to filter every bit of it...he did it every single day, he was positive, patient (he would probably be finishing Virginia by now if he hadn't had to wait on me!), and he kept me laughing through the hardest of times. We got to reminisce about loved ones, talk about life, and experience this beautiful world God created. The decision to get off the Trail was mine. I can't fully express how difficult that decision was for me, and I know some will look at it as a failure...and I'm at peace with however people view it. Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail was never a physical goal or accomplishment for me. It was, in my dreams, to be a spiritual and peaceful journey in nature, where I've always felt closest to God. What I didn't realize, even after all the books I read and research I did, is that, at least for me, the nature of the time constraints and mileage requirements of a thru-hike left no room or energy for anything other than the gratification that I physically made it through another day. After a month of that, and the realization that my hopes and dreams about my Trail journey were disappearing faster than a Snickers around the campfire, I decided that section hiking the Trail, where I can take my time and experience the beauty, rather than race through it, would be the best way for me to fulfill my dream. On our last day, we hiked from Spivey Gap to Uncle Johnny's in Erwin, TN. We saw our first blooms on the beautiful rhododendrons we had seen since GA...it was like they knew it was my last chance to see them. We also had the Nolichucky River in our sights on the way down to town. Although my 27 days on the Trail were not what I envisioned, I still feel so very blessed and fortunate to say that I hiked 335 miles of the AT with the best dad in the world, and with the phenomenal support and encouragement of all our family and friends that wrote, called, texted, and emailed us and gave us such inspiration to follow this dream of mine. I will be forever grateful!","Spivey Gap
