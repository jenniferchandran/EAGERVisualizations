The fact that in less than 2 weeks I'll be curled up in my tent somewhere in Georgia is both thrilling and intimidating. All I can think about is the trail and what gear I still need, what food I'm dehydrating next, how I hope this is the last snowfall we get... Getting hurt right before I started was tough mentally and physically to overcome and stay committed to hiking, but it's taught me a lot about patience. And thank goodness for physical therapists. Can't wait to make a trip to BJ's (shout out to John for bringing me) and buy enough rice to feed a small village, millions of bunnies in Annie's mac, and a disgusting amount of oatmeal. I'm still not sure how I want to package it up because using ziploc bags for every single meal seems like such a waste, but I have yet to come up with a more parsimonious solution while still keeping it as simple as possible. I wish I could freeze time for like a week and throw everything together, but it's inevitable that I'll pull an all-nighter before we leave as I do before every big trip. I hate packing. At least I only have 1 bag to fill this time. I'm really appreciating the luxuries of being a human in the 21st century, such as a super soft bed, refrigerator, and hot water shower. Sometimes the ""why the f am I doing this"" thought crosses my mind, but a flood of reasons replaces it quickly. I CAN'T WAIT FOR SOME ADVENTURES!!!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Mon",0

Let me explain about my knee: One month ago today (Feb 22), I was skiing despite the pathetic winter we had. I didn't realize they had made one of the jumps larger overnight, and didn't get enough speed to clear the knuckle. My legs locked up as I hit flat and jammed my hip and knee, damaging the soft tissue in my right knee, tensing my IT band, and compressing the muscles in my hip. It didn't hurt at first so I continued skiing for the rest of the day, but after sitting in a warm car on the ride home, everything became swollen and I had immense pain in my right knee. The next day I tried to carry my pack on a walk like I did every other day to train, and I barely made it a tenth of a mile before I broke down in tears. I tried stretching, icing, walking without a pack, but nothing helped. By March 1 I was confined to sitting on the couch to rest and reset it as much as possible before my hike. I began going to physical therapy, and they helped get me to the point where I could walk without pain. However, I spent a month without actual training, and my legs were weak. Less than 2 weeks before my start date, my knee was feeling back to normal, and I made the mistake of trying to go for a run. The first half mile felt amazing - I could run! I had been sitting on my butt for a month other than PT, and here I was, RUNNING! Suddenly I felt a twinge of pain in my knee, and panic set in. I tried to slow down, but the damage had been done; I slowed to a walk and even that was incredibly painful. It felt like when I was first hurt. I was angry with myself, but also scared - if I couldn't run even a mile, how was I going to hike 2,189 miles?! I went back to PT and dedicated myself to stretching at home and icing multiple times a day. By April 4, I felt like I was at 90% recovered. I still hadn't tried hiking with my fully loaded pack, but I was determined to figure it out as I went. 
Around noon on April 5, I picked up my dad from work and we drove up to Boston Logan airport. About a foot of snow covered the parking lot where we left the car, and it was 80 degrees and sunny when we left the Atlanta airport. It felt unreal to see palm trees and a clear blue sky instead of dead grass and dirty snow on the side of the road. We had pizza and beer for my last supper, and only got lost 3 times on the bumpy dirt road that took us to the Springer Mtn parking lot. We arrived around 11pm and night hiked up to the summit of Springer Mtn, the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. We could see the city lights below and stars above, and I imagined my dad standing there 36 years ago, about to begin the same journey I was. I was scared, excited, amazed, and still trying to process that the day had finally arrived for me to start. Well, the night. We camped near the shelter just north of the summit, and between the relentless wind, cold, and nerves, I barely slept. My tent felt strange and small, and I was freezing despite my down sleeping bag. I wasn't sure how my dad slept - he had a summer bag and no tent. He woke me up at 4:30am when he left to hike back to the car and head to work. I slept a little longer, then got up and packed up my gear. ""Am I really here? Am I really a thousand miles from home, about to WALK back?!"" My head spun with excitement, and I realized I wasn't even scared, just overly thrilled to get to hike every day on what felt like an endless trail. I wouldn't have to watch the clock and turn back, there was no loop leading back to my car, I literally could walk as far as I wanted for as long as I wanted. I was living in the woods! I can't remember the last time I was so excited. My journey has begun.",,TO DO,"Mar 22, Tue",0

At the end of May, my knee suddenly began to hurt with every step, and even the slightest downhill could bring me to tears. I struggled to make it in to Woods Hole Hostel where I had a food box waiting, and as I turned east on to Sugar Run Road, I had to hold back the tears. I was so scared my hike was ending. How could I keep going with such pain?? I turned in to the hostel driveway and was greeted by a beautiful yard with flowers, gorgeous old house, fields, and gardens. I found friends there, and was set up in the bunkhouse. But nothing could shake the terrible gut feeling that this was it. I planned on eating alone, but Neville, the woman who's grandmother started the hostel years prior, convinced me to come to dinner later. I reluctantly agreed, then took a hot shower, and opened my food box to find cookies from my sister! The day started to look up, and I joined the communal dinner. Before eating, Neville gathers everyone in the front yard to share our names and something we are thankful for, which forced me to realize that I had hiked over 600 miles, made incredible friends, still had my health, had a safe and dry place to sleep, food to eat, and even had a shower. I was thankful for a lot. Dinner was AMAZING - fresh vegetables from their garden and meat they had raised themselves. Neville bakes fresh bread daily, and there was more than enough food to make sure everyone was contentedly stuffed. I went to sleep happier than I expected. The next day I decided to zero and explore my options. Between the hostel and nearest town lay 11 miles of flat ground except one 2,000 foot downhill that my knee shuddered just thinking about. I was so scared of it, the pain I knew would come from hiking down it. I inquired about slack packing, and Neville, who knew about my injury and pain, told me to take another couple of days of rest and see how it felt - I could do work for stay! One girl who had been helping was out sick for a few days, so she needed the help. I finally understood what people mean when they say 'it felt like a weight had been lifted off my chest' because I physically felt my shoulders relax and I could breathe easily. I didn't have to face the downhill yet. Neville and Rakela, another girl doing work for stay, showed me the ropes cleaning bathrooms and hostel rooms, cleaning the bunkhouse and shower house, vacuuming, watering plants, weeding, and my favorite, helping cook. Neville has all sorts of recipes for huge groups of people and can orchestrate a kitchen full of people to produce delicious, wholesome meals for over 30 people!! I love the art of taking time to pick vegetables, clean and cut them, and turn them in to a dish. I learned how to make smoothies for hungry hikers and make reservations. I also learned that owning a hostel is stressful, especially amidst the busy season. But the peace of Woods Hole always came through. I watched thousands of fireflies flicker in a dissonant, beautiful pattern throughout the trees and meadow. The sun set directly behind the fields, granting us incredible sunsets, and there were no sounds of human rush besides the two cars that passed per day. We survived the water crisis (the hostel ran out of water temporarily and we had to go out to eat a couple nights), corralled the pigs when they escaped, and laughed every night around the table as we planned out the next day. I loved it there. Neville and her husband Michael, Cricket, Colonel, Rakela, and Jess who all worked at the hostel became my family. Hikers I had hiked with over the past months stopped in and I got the chance to see them all and catch up with what was happening on the trail while I rested. It was hard to see them leave and keep hiking - I wanted to be out there. But I had to take care of myself, and Neville gave me the best gift in allowing me to rest for 10 days. I can't thank them enough for all they did for me. Even though I wasn't hiking, I learned so much at Woods Hole. I learned patience and how to stay strong and focused in the middle of chaos. I learned to always ask about the vegetables you're picking because sometimes you can pick the wrong ones (sorry Michael!). I kind of learned how to stay focused on one task and complete it before starting a new one...kind of. Neville and I both bounced from one job to the next, but Rakela was on our cases to ""stay in your own lane!"" I am so thankful that I had the chance to work on an organic farm and hostel, and I can't wait to return, hopefully to finish the trail!!","Woods Hole Hostel

Pending,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550409,"Returning to the trail after a 20 day breakI brooded over my options for returning to the trail, considering every pro and con, debating with myself endlessly. My final decision to leapfrog ahead to Harper's Ferry was based on a few important factors: - I estimated that I wouldn't reach Katahdin before it closed in Oct if I returned to mile 623 because I was hiking slower than before- I didn't want to do a flip flop up in Maine in Oct when it would be freezing- If I was in Maine in the late fall, I would have to carry extra gear for cold temperatures and my pack would be heavier, which my knee would be unhappy with- I didn't want to do a traditional flip flop and return with my recovering knee to Maine where the mountains were huge- If I skipped 400 miles, people I knew would be in that vicinity and my dad pointed out it would be smart to be near people who knew me- Harper's Ferry has a train station next to the trail for an easy return- WV, MD, PA, NJ, and NY are all relatively flat terrain, ideal for building up my strength without straining my knee and hip moreI was somewhat upset I wouldn't be doing a typical straight northbound thru-hike, but I wanted to give myself the best chance at finishing. While I was home resting my injured knee, I took a hard look at my pack contents and made some changes. I left my 20 degree sleeping bag for a blanket, switched out my insulated sleeping pad for a piece of blue foam, took pages from my journal to write in instead of the entire thing, and left a bunch of random items (extra hat, rope, fleece clothes, etc.) to drop about 8 lbs of gear. I also bought a cheap foam roller and cut it in half to take with me. I also got two massages, thanks to Becky who is a therapist in training (and quite an exceptional one already!) and my awesome Aunt Beanie (she must have read my mind because all I wanted for my birthday was a massage, and that's exactly what she surprised me with). Anyone with IT band or knee problems - I would definitely recommend these changes. I went from barely being able to walk, to hiking at the pace I desired. At Harper's Ferry, one of my good friends, Foxtrot, who I had hiked with most of the first 623 miles of my adventure, met me off the train! It truly felt like I was coming home. Although we all begin as strangers on the trail, we become family. We hiked out to the first shelter in the late afternoon and I had my first taste of summer heat in the mid-Atlantic states. But we walked along the Potomac River on a beautiful flat section, my knee didn't hurt, and I was back on the trail, which was all that mattered. I was so happy. We camped behind Ed Garvey Shelter and I couldn't even use the blanket I had brought because it was so hot, but nothing could diminish my excitement to be in the woods doing what I loved. Although I couldn't keep up with Foxtrot the next day, I hiked through a thunderstorm and then watched hail pour down at a campsite. Another familiar face showed up, Fern, and we laughed and caught up and enjoyed pizza delivery!! I was determined to stay on the trail, so I kept my speed and mileage below what I knew I was capable of. However, my knee held up on the flat terrain and I soon was able to keep up with Fern as we hiked north. She was excited to slow down a bit and enjoy the ride, and I was happy for the company because most everyone was passing me. We had a similar agenda - we both sent ourselves food boxes so we had to go to post offices, we both kept journals, and we both liked sitting out the heat of the day in the shade and hiking later into the evening. We both hated night hiking alone, but barely noticed when we navigated the trail in the dark together. I figured eventually our schedules would divert and I would be hiking alone again, but as it turns out we had found the perfect hiking partnership. During the day, sometimes we hiked together but often we hiked alone, and met up for snacks and meals to laugh and revel in the beauty around us. We had each other's backs, and she became one of my best friends. I never thought I would see her in New England, never mind Katahdin, but on Sept. 12 we summited together with both of our families supporting us on top of that grand mountain. I can't thank her enough for all of the adventures and memories we made; every day was exciting. The 1,200 miles or so we hiked together were the absolute best.","Harper's Ferry, WV

Pending,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550408,"The final 400 miles of my thru-hike:I returned to Woods Hole Hostel to start off the last section of my hike. Unlike the rest of the trip, I would be completely alone since the majority of hikers at that time were southbound and I would be hiking north. It felt surreal to walk up to the trail junction from the hostel. On my left, south, I saw the trail where I had come from months prior in so much pain, unsure whether I would be able to continue north. I stopped and smiled, then turned right to head towards Maine and West Virginia, my two ""summits"". My whole body was filled with joy - I had overcome every obstacle to get back to that turnoff and finish what I had started. I felt stronger than ever before. My conclusion was in reach!","Sugar Run Gap, VA
