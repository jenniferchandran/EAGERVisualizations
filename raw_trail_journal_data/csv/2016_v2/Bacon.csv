Bacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554333,"I am starting to get really excited. Only 20 more days to go before I start the AT northbound. I have my gear all dialed in and I am still doing some physical preparation. I have exactly 1 mile hiked already as my wife Sam and I hiked to the southern terminus and back from Big Stamp Gap. For those of you who don't already know, my trail name is Bacon. I received that name one morning at Peck's Corner Shelter in the Smokies. I pulled some pre-cooked bacon from my food bag and everyone there said ""BACON"" and the name stuck.More to comeHike On!!",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Wed",0
Bacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554340,"My wife and I drove to Big Stamp Gap from Knoxville TN two weeks ago and hiked the mile to the southern terminus and back. It was pretty busy but we were able to find a parking spot in the parking lot. It Was also busy at the top. When we returned to the car there we other cars parked up and down USFS RD 42. The temperature was in the upper 30's, not too bad, and the views were awesome.",,Southern Terminus,"Feb 08, Wed",2
Bacon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554341,"Attended an REI class on Mon. night about thru hiking the Appalachian Trail. There was a panel consisting of four 2016 thru hikers and one section hiker there to answer questions and give their opinions about what to expect on the thru hike. The class was ok, but personally I didn't learn much from what I already knew as a long time section hiker.",,View Entry,"Feb 08, Wed",0

There was some awesome trail magic there, hot dogs with BACON chips fruit soda water and other stuff. Staying tonight at the Top of Georgia Hostel. But I have some sad news. Due to some unexpected issues that have popped up over the last several days, I am forced to leave the trail this year. I would like to thank everyone for their interest in my hike this year. I will continue to section hike this summer and post some things here. Hike On!!
