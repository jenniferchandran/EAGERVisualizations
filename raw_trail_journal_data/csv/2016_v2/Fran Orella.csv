Fran Orella,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517660,"So about a week ago I finally decided what I'm doing with my foreseeable future. I've had this dream for as long as I can remember. But in no way does that mean that I'm prepared. I've been struggling with an active eating disorder for the last two years, and I recently got out of treatment. For those of you who don't know what ED treatment is like, you're not allowed to exercise. You're allowed to walk at most about a quarter mile one time a day. A mere few months later, and I maybe exercise once a week. And now, last Sunday, I decided I'm finally going to do it: hike the Appalachian Trail. This is my chance to do it, since I'm taking a year off from college to see what I really want out of life. I'm also trying to decide on my trail name, or wondering if I should let others choose for me. I'm leaning toward Grit right now if I choose for myself. Anyway that's all for now but I'll keep checking in as I'm getting prepared.","

Fran Orella,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517805,"So today was my first practice day hike on the AT. It was 7.2 miles just north of the Mohican Outdoor Center. Not a bad day for my first day out, since last time I did about 2 miles max. The first mile was absolutely painful, and all uphill, but after starting out how fast I used to walk, and realizing that wasn't going to fly, I found my own pace and the miles started to get easier. They weren't exactly flying by, but definitely better than when I started. Will talk to you all soon.","

Fran Orella,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517886,"So yesterday I ordered the guide books for the AT. I hope that I ordered the right ones...We'll find out tomorrow I guess. Anyway I walked another half hour or so today, on the treadmill so it was extremely boring, but I got about 1.8 miles. My thinking is that with regular training on a treadmill and stair-climber through the winter I'll be at least somewhat in shape for the trail in the Spring. I might be changing my start date to Feb 25 just to get out a few days sooner.On the hike two days ago and on my short walk today there has been no knee pain, which is probably what I'm most worried about for the trail. I've had it in the past and I don't want it to stop me from accomplishing my dream. But anyway so far so good!I've also been searching for a trail name. After talking to my girlfriend and parents, I came up with Care Bear. It definitely seems to fit and sum me up in only two words, so I'm strongly considering it now. But before I decide I want to try it on so to speak for a few hikes. Anyways that's all for now so I'll talk to you soon!","
