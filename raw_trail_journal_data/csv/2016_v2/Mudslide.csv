Mudslide,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522998,"This is my first attempt at a thru hike of the appalachian trail. I have previously hiked the Hawaiian mountain ridges and have wanted for a long time to hike the AT. Last year I spent time training up as best i could by taking walks with the wife and reading up on other people's trail journals. Did a few section hikes in the Georgia portion of the AT. I have certainly learned a lot from the other hikers by reading about their adventures. In the event I don't get to complete my adventure, at least I can say I have enjoyed the journey. I plan on doing a flip flop by going from Springer to Maryland or thereabouts, take a month long Zero in May to celebrate my daughter's graduation, and then start back up from Katahdin to Maryland. I know this is not a conventional flip flop, but it was the only way I could think of to work in a month long family vacation to Europe and Asia after the daughter's graduation. I have somehow convinced my daughter to come with me for a portion of the hike. She is coming with me for a few weeks in June, to see what the AT thru hike is all about. I'm secretly hoping that she enjoys that experience and decides to just finish up as much of the summer vacation on the AT before starting College in August. Flip floping from NOBO to SOBO, also ensures that I wont be locked out of the Oct 15 closing of Katahdin. I didnt want to start back where i left off in Maryland and miss summiting Katahdin somehow.",,AT preparation,"Mar 03, Thu",0
Mudslide,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523004,"Started my adventure by weighing my pack at the Amicalola Falls Visiter's Center. The scale showed 35 pounds, think it was a bit off as it weighed 34 at home. Maybe someone stuck a 1 lb rock in my pack, hmmm. There was a former thru hiker, who is now working as a ridge runner, inside the building that was registering thru hikers. I was number 358. When i remarked to the ridge runner that my pack weight was the lowest on the hiker registration page, she made a comment that a smallish gal had just gone through with a pack weighting 60 pounds. Oh my.Wife drove me up to the Lodge that overlooks the water falls. Started my hike by taking the AT approach trail up to Springer Mountain. The path was covered with melting snow. Looks like I had just missed the brunt of the storm that came through yesterday. Since I had previously hiked in full gear the steps of the water falls, I decided to skip it this time.Halfway up Springer, Zam passed me, then i passed him, and we ping ponged a bit. We ending up talking and hiking up together to the first white blaze. Stopped and slept in the Springer Mountain hut. It was a cold night on top the mountain. Not much sleep, kept tossing and turning all night. Someone up on the top level of the shelter was snorning. I didnt feel like getting out of my sleeping bag to get my earplugs.","Amicalola Falls Park Approach

Mudslide,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523005,"Woke up to no holes in my pack. Success. I had hung my food bag in the bear line, but was wondering if the lingering odors of my snacks that i had half opened in my pack would bring mice to chew holes in my gear. Either it was too cold or they are still hibernating somewhere.After doing the necessary camp chores like getting water, cooking, and packing it was off the next shelter. I had brought a tent with me, but decided to stay in the shelter for a few days so i can just get used to the camp routine. It was a lot of PUDS with several water sources along the way due to the melting snow. I was going to keep it at a 8 mile a day pace, at least in the first week or two, until I get acclimated to the trail. I dont want to get an injury in the first few weeks of my hike. I tried to keep up with Zam and another hiker who was legally blind in one eye, but they flew past me.When i got to Hawk Mountain shelter, only four of us decided to sleep in the hut. Everyone else, I am guessing about 20 or 30 hikers, decided to pitch their tents or hammocks outside. They all thought it was a good idea as the weather was warm (50+ degrees during the day) and no adverse weather was predicted. I proceeded to go about my camp duties, and in the process I got my trail name. Initially i had used ""Last Call"" as a trail name but this was soon changed to Mudslide. Everyone had gone down to get water, so i took my boots off and put on my camp flip flops. As i got near the water source, I noticed it was actually a small stream with a very muddy and slick bank. I very carefully stepped down one step at a time to the edge of the water. And at the very moment i placed my last step, SLUMP! I fell flat on my back and halfway into the stream. I had mud halfway up my back and was sitting in the 30+ degree water. Hence my new trail name, Mudslide.","Springer Mountain

Mudslide,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523008,"Last night was a doozie. Storm came through and it rained and hailed for like an hour. Couple of the hikers got wet, especially Turtle who had setup his hammock in tent mode on the ground. We had all thought it was going to be a nice night as it was clear skies and only a small chance of freezing rain.Could not sleep again, tossing and turning all night every half hour or so. I think I must have kept everyone up with my turning cause I didnt hear anyone snore last night. My air mattress is very comfortable, but it also makes a rustling noise with any movement. I could have sworn i heard a rat, but busted out the headlamp and looked around. Nothing.Met a few more hikers today, Aaron, Jason, Roy and Wanderdog. Hiked to Gooch Mountain Shelter, as it was only 8 miles away. Saw a lot of good stealth camp sites along the way, including one along a stream. We had just stopped and took our packs off at the top of Sassafras Mountain for a break, when two ladies come strolling SOBO saying trail magic at the bottom of the mountain. You guessed it, we quickly put our heavy packs back on and went as fast as safely possible down the other side of the mountain that we had just laboriously climbed.MacGyver and NoName from the class of 2015 AT was there with another thru hiker who I forgot to get the name of, were there throwing a grand trail magic at Cooper Gap. It was amazing and totally unexpected. We had thought that it would not be at least until Woody Gap that we might encounter Trail Magic, but here it was. Thank you so much you guys! We had hot dogs, cokes, oranges, bananas, Columbian Coffee and a whole lot more. The Trail Angels had setup a bunch of chairs around the tables and MacGyver preceeded to provide valuable insights and suggestions for a successful thru hike. Turns out I was sleeping in the shelter backwards. I had placed my head up against the wall with my feet to the opening. MacGyver suggested that I sleep with my head at the opening of the hut, which allows the mice at the hut to run around the edges of the walls and not disturb my sleep. Maybe that is why I was not getting a good nights sleep, mice were running all over my face at night and keeping me awake.We thanked the three trail angels and proceeded onto Gooch Mountain Shelter. This time the hut was packed with people. Both upstairs and downstairs levels were full. I guess they all got the message from last night's freezing rain and hail. So I decided to pitch my tent tonight. I am using a Fly Creek UL1, built for one hiker. Thats all i really need, plus it only weighs 2 pounds and 1 ounce.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Mudslide,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523011,"Fly Creek UL1 is too small for me. The inside dimensions are 30"" by 42"" with a 38"" peak height. When I tested it out at the outfitters and at home, it seemed fine. I could get in and move around and not have my head hit the top of the tent when sitting inside. What I didnt consider was that I would have a pack inside the tent along with a sleeping pad and a 20 degree bag. I was hunched over in the tent and could not sit up straight, as I now had several inches of air mattress pad and sleeping bag under me. Plus with the backpack with me inside, I had no room to enter the tent and turn around. So i had to go back out and enter the tent backwards and on my knees. I need to fix this asap. Fortunately I bought my tent from REI and i can still do an exchange with my receipt.We hiked to Woody Gap with the hopes of walking a half mile down the road to the new Woody Gap Outfitters that Sir Packs a Lot just opened up. We then found out that the sign for the outfitters was placed at the 0.5 mile mark, but the actually store was located next to the gas station in Suches, GA. There is a hostel there as well upstairs from the outfitters. Lucky for us that Carry-On from 2012 thru hike was there in her van to drive us down the 2 mile long highway. No sidewalk or median to walk on, not safe. I noticed that Carry-on kept going all afternoon driving up and down from Woody Gap, shuttling hikers down to the hostel.Aaron and three of his hiker friends were in the Hiker Resupply store (formerly a gas station) eating pizza and loading up on resupply. They each had bought a large pizza, sodas and other snacks and had slices left over. I guess hiker hunger has not set in yet. They kindly offered up the leftovers to several of us that just arrived. We quickly devoured any evidence of pepperoni pizza. Two German from Hamburg, who had also purchased a large pizza each, could not finished theirs. I kindly stepped in and solved the problem. Walked over to the Woody Gap outfitters and Vanilla, a thru hiker from 2015, found two mountain house meals in the hiker box, and then offered it to us. Wanderdog took one and I took the other. There was a left over MSR fuel canister in the box as well. What more could i ask for. I fired up the stove and ate my mountain meal. Then came a half liter of Dr pepper then some spicy beef jerky from a fellow hiker, and I was not gonna move for a couple of hours. I picked up some items from Sir Pack a Lot's outfitter store.Called REI in Atlanta and they had one Copper Spur UL2 in stock. They put it on hold for me to pick up the next day.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Mudslide,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523014,"Two Zero days. Went over to REI the first day and picked up the Copper Spur UL2. Set it up with the gear inside, success. This model has two doors on the side and two vestibules. Also has a 42"" peak height that extends the whole width of the tent. The Fly Creek UL1 had the peak height at only one spot. Bad part is I gained a pound of gear as the new tent weighs 3 pounds and 1 ounce. Did a pack explosion on the living room floor to find at least 16 ounces. I was not going to gain weight in my pack. No way. Tossed out a few items. Exchanged my town clothes with lighter weight versions. Back to 34 pounds with several days food and 2 liters of water. My previously weigh in at Amicalola was 35 pounds with food and only 1 liter of water. Out of curiosity I weighed myself and noticed i was down 3 pounds, and this was with my clothes on. I usually weigh myself sans clothes.Next stop was the dentist office where i had an appt for exam and cleaning. Dentist found signs of decay in a filling that was cracking, and recommended a crown. Oh well, its gonna have to wait a few months, as I am going back on the trail tomorrow morning","Suches, GA
