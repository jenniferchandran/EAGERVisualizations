Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536783,"I spent the day sleeping at the shelter, barely able to go collect water, let alone hike at all. Various people, including Thunderbolt and Iron Mike, stopped by and wished me well. Thunderbolt was kind enough to give me his last Claritin and sown Benadryl. I chose not to take any medication in hopes my body would be able to break the fever naturally through rest and fluids. By the end of the day, I decided I should really be in short walking distance from running water and a toilet, so I called around looking for a trail angel to house me or drop me off at a hotel. Bonnie and Clyde gave me the number of a trail angel, Brave, who was willing to house me and take me to a doctor, but wasn't able to pick me up that evening. I ended up again staying the night at the shelter, and a very nice section hiker fetched water for me. The next morning, Brave drove 45 minutes to pick me up, distraught when she arrived after having just learned of the death of Baltimore Jack, a legendary thru-hiker and hostel caretaker. Brave took me to a Doctor and to get the antibiotics prescribed for my respiratory virus (breeding super bugs in my body!!) before dropping me off at her house. I stayed with Brave through Friday and got lots of rest and water. I also met other thru-hikers Brave had helped out (Magic, Double Dip, and Dirt Face). On Friday, Double Dip, Dirt Face, Brave, and I had a ladies night and made Alfredo, salad, bread with Brie, and strawberries for dinner, then watched a move and ate popcorn.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518181,"The tears finally reared their ugly heads as my emotions swarmed my chest, my stomach, my eyes, and my uterus. They had threatened an appearance a time or two, dancing just below my eyelids, but they had been kept at bay with a fleeting thought. But last night, the floodgates had collapsed with the realization of how much I would miss my wife. As she held me in her arms, I confessed I felt guilty for worrying her and my mother when I couldn't even verbalized why the hell I was doing this. She, being the beautiful sage she is, promptly scolded me that her worries were none of my concerns; they were hers to deal with and all I needed to worry about was taking care of myself. It was in that moment I realized part of this journey is simply that: to care for myself. One of the driving forces in my life is caring for others and making their lives better. But after my most recent career change, I've come to realize, while that does provide a great sense of accomplishment and purpose, it also leads to such a high level of anxiety I fail to properly address my own needs and eventually those for whom I am providing care. It's time for me to let go of my responsibilities to others and rediscover my relationship with myself. Imma do me for the next 6ish months.","murfreesboro, tn

As I was looking over my list, attempting to find ways to lighten my load, I thought about preparing for my monthly visitor, Aunt Flo. I suppose she must have known I was thinking about her because she decided to visit me without warning a bit early this month. :-/ Anywho, I'm not a lover of the tampons; they've always been exceptionally uncomfortable and even the most technical of brands failed to fit properly, leaving me with pads as being the only viable option....or were they....after a bit of research, I discovered the DivaCup. I'll forgo the details of how it works and anyone who's truly interested can look it up. The item didn't arrive in time for heavy flow, but I wore it over night last night quite comfortably with a light flow. I highly advise anyone wanting to decrease their impact on the environment or not wanting to hike out used menstrual items to give the Diva Cup a spin.","murfreesboro, tn

I weighed my ""standard"" drop box, which had 6 days worth of food, TP, toothpaste, batteries, hot hands, and a fire starting kit. It weighted almost 13 pounds, which means I've done well to stick to the 2 pounds a day for food. ?? I had stuffed everything into a $17.50 Priorty Flat Rate box, but the cost to ship the box by weight was only $13.55. I'm very happy to have learned this because, while my Tetris skills are strong, it will be Annie, not I, who will ship the boxes.","

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518333,"Life can be complicated. It's intricacies can be both beautifully moving and dramatically altering, particularly for those who are more sensitive to the environment. These people hear the minute sounds which may be slightly aberrant in tone, volume, or rhythm, and a person with heightened sensitivity will hear that above all other sounds, including an engaging conversation. Sounds can be painful, and not just the high pitched shrill of an ambulance...though those are particularly painful. These people can also pick up on the subtly in your voice when you are unable to lie with conviction. These people can be moved to tears with the sounds of joy experienced when a novel idea is understood, the rapture in a person's laughter, or a poetic piece of music. And that's just once of the senses...Smell, taste, touch, sight, vestibular...all at a heightened awareness. Most people who adhere to the cultural norms of American society are barraged daily with an arsenal of sensory input on a daily basis. Driving to work you experience car horns, break lights, anxiety in traffic, a turning signal, car exhaust fumes, the dump (Ugh!), the radio, a bird swooping before your car, a hill that (when you hit the correct speed) makes your stomach flop up and down, causing you to become just a bit dizzy. But that's just the outside. Then there's the tightening of your throat, the jolt of electricity throughout your entire body, and the pounding of your heart in your ears as you slam the breaks to avoid the bumper of the car in front of you. This feeling does not subside when you realize you will, indeed, survive another moment. There's also the tightening of your stomach, the slimy feeling of your sweaty palms gripping the steering wheel, and the racing of your heart as you get closer and closer to the job which makes you feel....And then there is everyone else. Their moods...can become your moods. This is wonderful when you surround yourself with beautifully happy people, like my wife. Singing a song or humming a tune (however out of key) spreads a sense of warmth throughout your body. This is in my (very non-scientific) opinion the energy people put off. This is probably the most difficult daily sensation for me to deal with because I am so sensitive to it. My mood can completely change for hours after spending minutes with someone who is consumed by negativity or drama. Many people are baffled at my decision to hike the AT solo, particularly in winter...but I am excited by the prospect of escaping the daily noise to embrace the symphony of nature. I have this romantic idea I will only encounter beautiful people along my trip....The AT awaits me...

I have almost finished documenting all my gear, organizing my mail drops, and other miscellaneous errands. I have created an outline of a schedule which puts me at hiking the summit of Mt. Katahdin on July 23, 2016. I would say that figure has a standard deviation of about 14.75 days. I have even organized the apps on my iPhone so my home screen has everything I will use on a regular basis. I suppose I may be a bit Type-A, but I hope to use that to my advantage to survive the bitter cold winds, torrential rains, and the ensuing aches and pains. This trait will not be of assistance to dealing with the sounds of the forest at night sleeping by myself. I will also have to set aside the need to reach insignificant goals in order to truly appreciate my surroundings by living in the moment. This is what I am most excited about.","

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519019,"And so it has begun! I awoke at 4am with nausea and vomited a number of times before crawling back into bed. We woke up at 6:30 to my alarm, showered (my last for a week!) and headed for the Saw Mill Place in Blairsville, GA. Due to my continued nausea and windy roads, I was not able to stuff my face as I had the previous night at the 5 Spot in Cleveland, TN (most likely the cause of my upset stomach.)After breakfast, we continuedto Woody Gap to await our shuttle. We met a NOBO thru-hiker, Matt, as well as a group of young men leaving the trail. Ron arrived and we began our journey to Springe Mtn. Along the way, we picked up a young couple who had traveled from Orlando, FL after decid By Christmas morning to hike the AT. They told us of a young girl who had her tent flooded and soaked her down sleeping bag. When they found her, she was so cold she said as not able to light her cook stove. She was planning to thru-hike, so I hope she makes it safely! Don gave us several pointers and dropped us off at the Springer Mtn parking lot. We took off for the southern terminus at 11:40am in a drizzle and arrived at the top in a cloud. The path seemed to be paved in silver and gold due to the Mica. After signing th register, we ""began"" our 2.8 mile hike to Stover Creek Shelter. After successfully crossing 3 creeks, we arrived wet and surprisingly early at 2:45pm. After we used the restroom, had a smoke, and collected water, a Brazilian family of three from Miami joined us. The father seemed as those his lips were incapable of closing for any extended period of time. He very graciously reminded me smoking can kill you, so I very graciously reminded him of the dangers of automobiles. The family retreated upstairs while we cooked dinner and enjoyed the sunset. The father seemed offended we did not wish to sleep upstairs with them...","Springer Mtn

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519024,"Sleeping was an adventure last night. We all went to bed around 7pm and the mice promptly awakened out upstairs neighbors. They had not brought anything in which to hang their food and the mice began their squeeky invasion. The father then proceeded to start a fire to burn their trash, the smoke billowing over our slumbering bodies. (Remember, smoking kills; burning plastic is A-OK). I awoke at 10:30 pm and spent at least 30 minutes arguing with my body that I didn't have to urinate. In the end, my body won, and I ran out in my undies to relive myself. I went back to bed and awoke at 4am to a dense fog. I did my best to sleep until 6:45, when I could no longer lay in my sleeping bag, no matter how comfy and warm it was. I got up and began the morning routine: toilet, water, coffee, food, pack, toilet. The father then spoke at length about the corruption of the food industry in American food industry, but I found it difficult to partake in the conversation after his sly comment about being woken up every time I woke up. I was particularly not fond of the smirk on his face when Annie informed him I was hiking to Maine. I was quite happy when they left and we began our 5.3 mi trek to Hawk Mtn Shelter. Along the way, we came across a campsite which looked as though it was the sc me of a gruesome event; an emergency blanket was thrown over a lump and a disheveled food bag was hanging from a tree. Upon further investigation, no mangled body found, so we cleaned up the sight and were gifted two Sea-to-Summit dry bags. We hiked on and took a rest at Long Creek Falls, where we spoke to several lovely people, including a local couple who took our photo and trash. Afterwards, we came to a curious and beautiful meadow on the top of a mountain before arriving at a road with a sign for Hickory Flatts Cemetary. We stopped for a poo, dried Annie's shoes, and played on a form of merry-go-round. We left and arrived at our home for the evening, where we met two genuine and bonafide southern gentlemen, Mike & Mike, from Atlanta, GA. We unpacked, chatted a bit, and explored the offbeat path, where we passed the time wit a smoke and a sip. Annie and I enjoyed a candlelit dinner (aren't I so romantic!) and a small fire before going to sleep holding hands.   ","Stover Creek Shelter

Had a lovely day crossing Ass Kicker #1&2 (aptly named by Ron), Sassafras Mtn., and Justice Mtn. We forded 2 creeks, Along one of which I found Jack from Nightmare Before Christmas.

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519462,"Wow. Yesterday was crazy! I started my period and had an epic Diva Cup fail. I realized a few miles down the trail I had bled through my pants, so Annie and I stopped to shed layers, peel and adjust the Diva. After I had emptied and cleaned the Diva, I was attempting to put it in its proper place when what appeared to be an Asian tour group of 10-15 people continued to pass by for a full 10 minutes; then came a young girl who stopped to chat; then there were the trail runners. What the hell? I finished my chore in a more than foul mood and broke down due to my monthly visitor, the fact we were put significantly behind scheudle, and the fact I would be saying good bye to my wife, whom I would not see again for another 2 months. Sunshine (a section hiker we met the night before) showed up and offered some pantyliners. Though I told her I already had some, she continued to insist until I finally accepted them. We caught up with her a short while later and she followed us to Woody Gao, talking non-stop the entire way. At Woody Gap, I re-stocked and re-packed while Sunshine continued to offer whatever she had in her pack she felt would be useful, successfully usurping the last private moments I had with my wife. She eventually set off and Annie and I had our tearful goodbyes. Filled with emotion (a mix of anger, sadness, and insanity...yes, I know insanity is not an emotion..), I set off at a quick pace, determined to make it to a shelter by nightfall. I eventually caught up with Sunshine and decided to hike with her to Blood Mountain. On the way, her GPS failed and she feared we were lost; luckily, I knew how to use a map and a compass and were made it to our destination around 7pm well after the sun had set. Everyone in the shelter had already bedded down for the night and almost did not make room for me (they had saved a spot for Sunshine). I went to bed without dinner and a little miffed. The next morning, I set out early (without breakfast) for Mountain Crossings Hostel, a short 1.5 mile hike, where I planned to stay the next 2 nights. When I arrived, I was told the hostel was closed for renovations....WHAAAAAAATTTT?!?!? (They also had no pads) I almost cried. They did, however, have a freezer with biscuits, of which I helped myself to 2 and Blue Eyes (an employee and former thru-hiker) hooked me up with a cup of beer. Afterwards, I bought some supplies (food, rain jacket, pack covert) and prepared a box to mail back home. AI reorganized my pack & Pretzel (a friend of Blue Eyes) bought me pads, a salad, and fruit during a run into town. Blue Eyes suggested I call Blood Mountain Cabins, but the office was closed. I tried calling the Hiker Hostel, but it was a $30 shuttle each way, so I decided to give hitching a go. I wrote a note explaining my situation and sat outside the Hostel's outfitter store, but people simply walked past looking the other way. I went inside to get my pack so I could stand at the road with my thumb out when a lovely family gave me a ride to Wolf Pen Country store. I took a shower, cleaned my clothes, and ate a meal I didn't have to cook over my camp stove (can chili, hot dog, Fritos, and salad). I spoke with my mom, my wife, and passed out on the couch listening to the howling winds outside.","Blood Mtn Shelter

Got a lift back to Neels Gap from the infamous Wes (who has been shuttling aspiring thru hikers, including Bill Bryson, for more than 30 years). I purchased a knee brace for my left knee (which I had killed on Blood Mtn.)and some aspirin and hit the trail. Knee hurt like hell, camp was cold as hell (it was well below 20F with windchill; my water immediately began to crystallize into ice once I filled it.

I was prepared to walk out today in search of a doctor for my knee, on account as I couldn't straighten it last night without being in excruciating pain. Although it hurts, the pain is manageable and the walking has thus far been easy. I think I may have only 1 mtn. to go before my shelter. With any luck, I will get there early. I've found 2 poops so far today...one raccoon & 1 possible bear. I lost my hat, but found a wool glove. I had lunch in the sun and mostly out of the breeze with a temperature of about 35F. I arrived at the shelter solo, so I set uyp my tent in the shelter; I was so proud to have set it up with rocks! I was soon joined by a group of 6 NOBO guys (New Years, Froggy, Victor, Justin, Trey, & unknown dude in a tent on the hill) and we chilled by the fire.

I ran into Justin, then Victor and Trey. We chatted for a bit and I thought they would be at Blue Mtn, but when I got there, Merple (a SOBO) said they had gone into Helen. Merple was cool and we chatted for a bit before he departed for a night hike to Low Gap Shelter =-0 He shared much advice about towns and hostels along the route as well as terrifying trail tails: Bears, freezing temps, endless days of monsoon rains, oh my! I though I was going to be alone for the night and got a bit scared when Steve showed up. He came to the trail to get away from people. Although I felt slightly reassured for that evening, I began to worry about my next two days before reaching the town. The miles would be long, the mountains steep, water scarce in some areas, and winds and rain would be an issue at the next shelter. Leaving for town crossed my mind, but I felt that would be cheating. I will push through. I will be okay. Two days. 
PS. I got a hit list on the trail today when I misjudged how close inward to the shelter. I hiked back and forth along the same .5mi of tail for about 30 minutes before saying ""f*ck it"" and pushing forward. The sight of the shelter nearly brought me to tears.","Low Gap Shelter

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519466,"Long day. Didn't sleep much last night on account of the mice scurrying past me, above me, and rummaging through my pack. I slept for approximately 4 hours with my headlamp on and George Lopez on my iPhone. I awoke at 6:15 and was greeted by a mouse peering up at me though the floorboards. I got up and out of that shelter in record time. I walked 12.8 miles to Sassafras Gap, where there was no shelter (only tenting). Along the way, I began to reconnect with my stomach and ate all my snacks for the day (a first!). Despite the extra intake of calories, they in no way made up for the cumulative deficit I had been experiencing. My body was weak, my knee was raging, my feet were aching, and I didn't know if I would have the energy to make it to my predetermined destination. On the verge or tears, I put on some tunes (21 pilots) to carry me the last 2 miles to the gap. When I finally arrived at the site, I set off first for the water down a steep mountain side to a fresh spring. I collected and purified my water before soaking my tired feet in the cool, crisp spring. I also attempted to wash my hands, by I believe dirt has a super power while hiking on the trail which makes all attempts to remove it entirely futile. Afterwards, I set up my tent and made dinner (one of those hiker add water meals). Despite the gnawing in my stomach earlier, I was unable to eat more than a few bites of what the manufacturers claimed to be chicken nachos. I was completely grubby and looking forward to town. I noticed today how hypersensitive my senses had become. I could sense the upcoming storm from the eerie stillness in the air (no wind or birds today). I could also smell a road I had crossed earlier in the day.","Blue Mtn Shelter

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519467,"I had a great night's rest in the storm (all scurrying sounds could be attributed to the wind) but woke up with everything damp. It was still raining and dark when I ventured from my wet abode and a dense fog made it difficult to see by my headlamp. I made breakfast in the tent, packed, pooed in a hole in the rain, and was on the trail by 8:20. I cleared my first mile in 20 minutes, surprising myself, particularly since I was laboring over every uphill step. I surprised myself again when I arrived at Deep Gap Shelter at 9:50. I took a 30-40 minute reprieve in the shelter, which actually had 4 walls (whaaaaat?!?!?), an opening for a door, and a chair, where I stuffed my face with a protein bar & trail mix. I could feel the extreme fatigue from not consuming enough calories, but I had yet to develop an appetite to match my energy output. I set off from the shelter with renewed vigor, be it from the sugar rush or the anticipation of staying in a bed with sheets and pillows. I had decided I would be spending the night at a Bed and Breakfast. I called from Powell Mountain to get a ride and spoke with Moriah, who informed me her husband, Dave, would be picking me up at Dick's Creek Gap at 12:30. I flew down the mountain at an amazing 2 miles an hour (my top speed at this point, which is significant considering going downhill tends to make my knee scream louder) and was at the rendezvous point by 12:20. When I arrived at the BnB, Dave showed me around and I hauled my pack into my very own 6ft claw-foot tub to unpack my mucky gear. After a shower (the first bathing experience of many during my stay), Dave drive me into town where I procured some much needed first aid supplies. We then went to Ingles grocery store, where I almost cried at the sight of fried chicken. I ordered a ready-made meal from the deli: fried chicken tenders, mashed potatoes with gravy, green bean casserole, and cornbread. I also loaded my basket with a salad kit, 2 bread rolls, brie, and an avocado. When we arrived at the house, I immediately gorged myself on my meal while attempting to watch a movie on TV. I found myself unable to sit still and relax, always needing to get up and perform menial tasks. Afterwards, I socialized a bit with the other BnB inhabitants and had an Epson soak in the tub while Skyping with Annie. At the end of the evening, I crawled into my king sized bed and at a half a bag of popcorn (oh yeah...I bought that too) before crashing. Some differences I noticed/ reflected on today:
- Trail food makes me nauseous
- My toes take turns feeling tingly/numb
- My toes look like Jimmy Dean Sausages
- I answer the question ""Do you have any dietary restrictions?"" with ""No, but I want fruit and vegetables.""","Sassafras Gap

After my 2nd, I was drunk. Matt showed up and we chatted a bit before I walked to the grocery store and raided it for more sustenance which did not require re-hydration. Back at the hostel, I fried up some garlic chicken to eat with my salad kit, but was only able to stomach a few bites of meat. Since the other NOBO guys (Victor, Trey, Frogs, and Justin) had showed up, I offered them my leftover chicken.

He told me of an event in which he caught and ate a shelter mouse for a roll of toilet paper. He also informed me he caught and ate grouse and a garter snake when he ran out of food. He also took a selfie with Trump (there was photo evidence of this) in NY and walked the Great Wall of China. I found these tales tall, alarming, and disturbing...but hey, at least I had some company for the evening. He did also share useful information on hanging packs and food using the ""PCT method."" It was successful last night, so I 'll give it a go again tonight. Summiting Albert Mountain has been the highlight of my week. The hike before and after were both fairly easy, but the mountain had me hiking over ice rocks and rock climbing. I nearly cried (I feel this is more common than it should be, but whatever...I'm a sensitive and emotional being) when I reached the top due to the breathtaking beauty and enormous sense of accomplishment. Not only had I climbed the mountain (quite literally at times), I completed over 100 trail miles! After arriving at the shelter, I began my ""nesting"" process and set up my tent in the shelter since it appeared I'd be the only one in for the night. After eating dinner, I was just about to smoke my first (and always best) cigarrette of the day when a man walked around the shelter carrying two sticks and no pack (there is a road within view of this shelter).

He convinced me to head in a night early and chatted with me while I packed my things. We arrived at he hostel, where the other NOBO boys were also staying, and Colin (aka mountain ninja) asked if Steve had found a way to the hostel. Justin informed him Steve was eating at a place in town, so we went to meet him.

With a somber tone and downcast eyes, they told me they were heading to the parking lot (where there had been an abandoned red car covered in a layer of snow) to file a police report; they had come across the bodies of a frozen man and a child, presumably his son, along the trail.

When we arrived, I felt as if I was in a scene from a SciFi alien flick; the trees were white, having been coated in a thick layer of frost, which was being flung at us by howling winds.

The boys quickly out paced me, leaving me alone with my thoughts as I arrived at Bearwallow Gap, a very rocky exposed ridge line that had received a fresh 1"" of snow and seemed to continue on and on. Though the AWOL book had the elevation profile of this area as pretty flat, I found myself scrambling up and down snow covered rocks/boulders for over a mile (and likely an hour, but I chose not to look at my watch to avoid disappointment). By the time I was off the ridge line, it was already 5pm, the skies were beginning to darken with heavier snow clouds and I still lacked 1.7 miles to my shelter. No longer fearing a wrong step would send me plummiting to an early grave, I quickened my pace and made it to the shelter by 6pm. There was already about 1.5-2 inches of snow on the ground and a roaring fire in the shelter, thanks to a wonderful caretaker (this is the first shelter I've been at thus far that had someone looking after it) who left a pile of firewood along the cabin. The boys were already cooking dinner, so I set about to completing my evening tasks. By the time I had eaten and went for my last restroom break, there was 4"" of fresh powder on the ground and we had to hang up my tent in order to block some of the snow that found a way through the two tarps already hung over the shelter's opening. We took turns stoking the fire throughout the night as we each work to use the restroom and the snow continued to pelt the tarps strong along the shelter's opening.","Allen Gap

The forecast was for a max of 6"" over the course of two days on the mountains. We woke up to 6"" after the first night and the snow was not stopping. Looking out the shelter, I was reminded of a blizzard in '92 or '93 where I spent a week trapped at my grandmother's house because of 6"" of snow. Einstein was ambitiously planning to hike 15 miles, but the rest of us were already formulating contingency plans. It took me only an hour of hiking with the snow stinging at my face to realize I needed to get the fuck off the mountain ASAP. Although the snow was light and powdery and not nearly as difficult to walk in as the snow in the Smokies, I had developed icicles on my hair and felt as though I had sandbags tied to my ankles. Bill caught up with me before reaching Flint Mountain Shelter (our designated lunch spot) and he commiserated with me on finding a way out of the snow. We waited for Sun Down while at the shelter and decided to call Uncle Johnny's for a shuttle from Devil's Fork Gap, a few miles down the trail. Bill handed me the phone to ""work my magic"" and procure us a ride. Within an hour and a half, we were in a warm van with Jeff, the hotel manager, and Jerry Garcia, the hostel mascot. Jeff reported Einstein had passed him by while he waited for us and had continued on to the next shelter. :-( Not a strong choice.

Luckily, I bought snow shoes today, so the snow promptly melted and Spring is sure to be right around the corner. I have deeply enjoyed my stay at Uncle Johnny's! Jeff, who runs the place, is an amazing guy and always has everyone's best interest at heart, though he tries to hide his soft side with sarcasm. When a questionable character came to stay in the hostel, he upgraded my stay in a cabin so I would be safe. <3 He also made a delicious seafood pasta (with squid, shrimp, octopus, clams, and oysters) and wilted salad that was by far the best meal I have eaten on the trail (sorry honey...)then took us to Johnson City for an all you can eat Chinese buffet our last night at the hostel. Jeff tries to be an ass, but he's a sweetheart!The weekend I spent with my wife seemed like a wonderful (wet) dream, which I will be replaying in my mind for weeks to come. Although a physical re-connection was a high priority, simply being able to see, smell, hear, and feel her soon became more important to me. I was overwhelmed with happiness (which, of course, means I cried) not when she arrived, but as I was making her coffee and breakfast as she groggily greeted the dawn by rolling to my side of the bed. I honestly could not tell you whether physical or sensual touch was more fulfilling; I think I could have lied on the couch watching movies and snuggling for days. I know and am at a loss for words to describe how blessed I am to have such a loving and beautiful wife. The morning she left, I tried hard to contain my emotions, but I broke and she held me and comforted me until my breathing returned to normal and my tears slowed to a trickle. We've never been apart this long and the idea of being without her again was too much. My healing waters did the trick and I was able to spend the rest of my time with her living in the moment and enjoying every second of it. The peace I feel when I'm with her is equal only to the serenity of the trail. I love my wife exponentially more than I hate snow.

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521895,"It was a very long, exhausting, and beautiful day. I led the group in the morning, but it was only a short while until Sundown and Bill Nye caught up with me. The game of the day was Obscicles: before passing under snow-laden branches, you whack the shit out of them with your trekking poles so they fly in the air with their newfound weightlessness and you are able to avoid wearing an additional layer of snow. I played this game until Sundown passed me, who preferred to pummel through the snow in his rain jacket. HYOH! After hiking halfway up Roan Mtn at a slow 1 mph, I again attempted to wear my snow shoes, but they blistered my feet and were extremely tedious to hike in, particularly when the trail sloped in any form or fashion. The peak of Roan Mtn looked like a scene from Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer, with snow-covered Spruce suffocating the trail. This was the first time I have felt claustrophobic among the trees and I expected Yeti at every turn, but he did not (sadly) appear. We had some amazing views from the balds after Caver's Gap & I often reminisced of my former trip there with my loving wife. After the views, I got just a wee bit cranky, as I was aching from my shoulders down. I raced the sun to the shelter with the moon as my guide (it rose quite early today and was, at times, in line with the trail) and made it just after sunset. Some section hikers were staying there as well and had started a fire and made a sock tree and rotisserie, over which they dried their footwear. They gave me a swig of honey whiskey to ease the bitching, which I accepted graciously.P.S. An additional factor to my bitching was my lack of papers with which to roll a smoke and the lack of any smokers from which I could procure a smoke or papers. I had asked the group of men with the whiskey...but alas, I was reduced to smoking tiny bits of tobacco from my one-hitter, which intrigued the group of men.

The 50+mph winds nearly knocked me over on top of Hump Mtn and despite the expansive vistas, I was ready to get to the safety of the trees, though they held their own tribulations: more deep snow. I followed the postholes of my hiking buddies and managed to only fall on my face once and my ass twice. Once I reached Doll Flatts, I left North Carolina for good and the snow was never more than 2"" deep. Not having had my morning constitution, I began to feel the pressure (literally) coming down the mountain to 19E, the road leading to the hostel. I checked my guide and estimated to be 1 mile or 30 minutes from the road and a toilet, so I pushed on. Unfortunately, I was wrong and 30 minutes later (and a good 1-2 miles from the road) I was loosening my hip belt to relieve some of the pressure.

I allowed myself to be sad, but I didn't wallow in it. Although I considered Bill to be like a brother, all siblings eventually grow old and leave the nest to live their separate lives at some point or another. Aside from losing Bill, I was mostly sad to be by myself again. Hiking solo generally means less laughter, knowledge, and security. Meh, oh well, the hike must go on. Within the first hour, I surprised myself when had cleared nearly 3 miles (on a seriously full belly, I must add). I went back and forth arguing with myself on whether I could do the same mileage as the boys, and began to admit defeat when I arrived 15 minutes after my deadline to my lunch stop for the day when I was ran into Sundown. I figured the trail was sending me a sign to push on, so I shortened my lunch, put some tunes on for extra inspiration, and pushed on. As the sun began to set and a fog rolled in, I became nervous I would lose the trail, especially since my headlamp was nearly useless in the fog, reflecting my light back at me. 30 minutes later, I spotted a bright light within the dark mist and whistled, getting Sundown's voice in response.

I decided I would stop in at Kincora, home of the legendary Bob Peoples, for lunch and to inquire as to the status of the Hampton hostel. Shelters are littered with Bob Peoples jokes such as: ""Bears hang Bob People's bags; Every time Bob Peoples builds a switchback, an angel gets its wings; Jesus asks for Bob Peoples' forgiveness; What Bob Peoples doesn't know doesn't exist.""

According to the guidebook, the only challenging portion appeared to the 3 pointless miles up Pond Flatts, followed by 3 miles downhill and the rest of the incline would be gradual...first off, the stairs into the gorge were basically the rock form of hell. I tried to go backward down the stairs to avoid putting too much strain on my knees. This seemed effective and I hauled ass the 3 miles up switchbacks before taking a leisurely lunch at the top of Pond Flatts. About 10 minutes into my hike down, I felt a jarring pain in my left quad. It was a bit akin to when you roll your ankle after stepping on a root, so I attempted to walk it off, but the pain only intensified. I slowed my pace and used my trekking poles as crutches as I began to sob in pain and fear. I was terrified I had torn something in my leg and would have to come off the trail for an extended time, a loss that would be beyond devastating. I became fearful I wouldn't be able to get myself down the mountain...the pain wasn't continual, but when that muscle would catch, I screamed in pain that was definitely a 8-10 on the scale. I seriously considered trying to call Bob Peoples to help me...which just pissed me off. Fueled by anger and pride and numb by whatever chemical my brain emits when I've had a panic attack (or two) with no Xanex to counteract it, I hobbled my stubborn ass off that mountain, pausing only to pee or scream, crying in pain, anger, and sadness the whole way down. After 2 hours, I sat at a picnic table at Watauga Lake and called my insurance company to find a doctor. It took her over an hour to find one, by which time I had already hitched a ride to the hostel in Hampton so I could have a place to stay in the event I couldn't see a doctor that day. After discovering a doctor in Abington, VA, I arranged a shuttle with Mount Rodgers Outfitters in Damascus to take me to the urgent care clinic, where the doctor informed me I had strained my quad. Just a bit of rest, compression, and ice and I'd be good to go. I felt a bit like a sissy since a muscle strain really doesn't sound that bad, but then I remembered how much it hurt and figured I ought to be thankful it wasn't worse rather than feeling weak for being in pain.

I added up the empty beer cans in the back seat to be $300 worth of open containers. When he dropped us off, I noticed he had close to $1,500 in the bed of his truck! Nubs and I parted ways (he was headed SOBO) and I enjoyed my walk in spring like weather through the woods, stopping to photograph the few blooms I came across. I stopped for lunch at Chatfield Shelter, where I discovered the offensive writings of some seriously immature NOBO hikers, one of whom had boasted of his “trolling” of other NOBO winter hikers while in Damascus, VA. While most if not all of the entries of these NOBO boys had been in poor taste, this entry discussed me being sodomized courtesy of the other hikers. I know an emotional response was the desired effect of the lewd writing, and try as I might to ignore it, I was unable to do so and walked the rest of the way to Atkins with a cloud above my head despite the glorious sunshine. By happenstance, I chose to get some cheese dip from the Mexican restaurant, and the waitress asked me to sign their hiker log book, though it would have appeared I had already been there as another member of the immature NOBO gang had made a comment in poor taste and signed my name. This tipped me over the edge. As a 30 year old woman, I find absolutely no humor in dicks being drawn in my journal, having my wife inquired as to if she would be taking her walk naked, being told dead bodies were discovered on a snow-covered mountainside, having someone write about “tag teaming” my ass with their (likely insignificant) boners, or have another individual impersonate me and write how I feel I am a fat ass. Action had to be taken. Annie wanted to get involved and suggested I not make direct contact with the assholes…I suggested she holster her gun. At the advice of Jeff and Uncle Johnny, I called to report the harassment to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. The office was closed, so I sent a detailed e-mail with photographs of the offensive and obnoxious writings. I thought bullying only happened in middle schools. Apparently, some bullies never receive the lesson in being a decent person they so deeply deserve.","Partnership Shelter

Knowing the answer is always “no” if you don’t ask, I took a risk and informed her I needed a place of respite for a few days. She inquired as to why and I explained I was trying to put distance between myself and a group of asshole boys. She hugged me and invited me to stay until she left town. I finished running errands with her, and she took me to her home and let me stay in her son’s old room. After washing my clothes, I was introduced to her son and husband.

I already have a crazy hiker tan from my knee braces. The climb up to Chestnut Ridge seemed daunting at first, with an elevation gain of 2,075 ft, but it was spread across 4.7 miles and only one mile was very challenging. The ridgeline is mostly an open clearing with some great views, the best of which was saved for last. From the shelter, you can gaze down into Burke’s Garden, an 8x4 mile crater created by the collapse of limestone caverns. The shelter is by far one of the best I have thus encountered, with 4 walls, a door, and a picnic table inside. The only downfalls are the not-so-nocturnal mice and lack of water source. About 30 minutes after our arrival, it became apparent the thunderstorm forecasted for the day was fast approaching. I bid farewell to Steve, who found it prudent to avoid sleeping in a hammock on a ridgeline in a severe thunderstorm, and opted for a campsite a few miles and about 1,000 feet lower. I was happy with my decision not to follow suit when the deafening roar of hail pounded on the tin roof. I hope the storm passes by morning so I can see the sun rise over the crater.P.S.

It was an easy hiking day and the prospect of a beer, burger, and shower had me hiking over 3 miles an hour. When I approached the gravel road which would lead me 0.6 miles to VA 52, I could not only smell, but could taste the pollution from the nearby interstate. I don't have much with which to compare the taste, as I typically don't intentionally and knowingly ingest pollution, but I would say it's how you'd (or I'd) think a battery would taste...bitter and metallic. Luckily, your sense of smell is the quickest to habituate to novel stimuli in your environment, so it wasn't long until the unpleasant experience came to an end. When I reached the road, I rolled a cigarette and sat on my pack with thumb extended. Several cars passed me by before Nancy, a nice older woman stopped with her dog (Lucy) and cat (unnamed, but described as having bowl irregularities) en route to the vet for the cat's monthly enema. Nancy was kind enough to drive me to Bland, VA and give me a tour of the town, which lasted approximately 3 minutes and included such exciting sights as: the grocery store, post office, mechanics, and the newly renovated court house. Afterwards, Nancy stopped at the Sunoco gas station, which doubled as the best local eatery, so I could buy a burger, fries, and Epsom salt before dropping me of at my final destination: The Big Walker motel, which was overpriced but clean. While eating my burger with the door open (a motel room is just far too confined when compared with the woods), I noticed one of the asshole NOBO boys I had been trying to evade. The hotel owner reported the other hikers had been there since the weekend due to an old injury flaring up. Karma sure is a bitch and glad she's on my side. That would be the second time his particular NOBO asshole had to get off trail due to injury/ illness after messing with me. Since Steve had yet to arrive, I finished my meal behind a locked door and drawn shades before showering and washing some of my clothes...in the shower. While I have previously washed my undies and socks (by far my smelliest pieces of garb) in the shower, due to the extensive amount of sweat and odor accumulated in my t-shirt and shorts, I threw them in as well. It took an entire bar of hotel soap and several rinses before brown water ceased to emerge from my clothing. I hung them to dry on a clothesline provided by the establishment and watched a bit of TV as I awaited Steve's arrival.

My extreme emotionality surprised me, but I suppose I've only had to worry about my own well-being for the last 3 months, and catering to my wife's needs while placing my own on the back burner was not something I realized I was unprepared to do. It took more than an hour and a few swigs of whiskey before I was able to snap out of my fog. Tinker Cliffs turned out to be a great place to regain myself and we're just as beautiful as McAfee and were isolated from the maddening crowds (thank goodness!). The hike up to the cliffs had no switch backs, and Annie had to take a break (this was pre-fight) and we were passed by Bones, with whom we later shared the shelter and some nice conversations.

While this upset me slightly, the annoyance didn't last long and I hit the trail by 9:30. It was odd crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway all day (5 total crossings) but here were some phenomenal views and trash receptacles, so I didn't mind much.

I'm definitely missing certain aspects of winter hiking. While I do love meeting new people and having someone with whom to commiserate the weather, mice, and terrain and share laughs about everything and anything absurd...the solitude I had experienced early on, which made being around people even more rewarding...has been elusive. Matt's Creek is a beautiful shelter with a creek flowing in front (always the best when you can hear the water source as you sleep!). I had a visitor around 9pm that was neither a human or a mouse. I sat up straight in my sleeping bag, with my heart pounding as I searched for the source of the rustling with my headlamp, but saw no eyes reflecting back at me, only the puffs of my raspy breathing in the dark cold night.

The owner was less than normal...and I'm still unsure of whether in a good way or a bad way. He was a self-proclaimed manic/depressive person currently in a manic stage. He was also a bit passive aggressive in regards to my choice of language...he asked if I always spoke ""like that,"" referring to my use of profanity...as well as my use of tobacco products, refusing to take me anywhere to purchase said products. He did, however, eventually take me into town to pick up my boxes from the Post Office while on his way to pick up Cosmo and Atlas. He also allowed me to stay for free after doing 1.5 hours of yard work. The family met up at a Mexican restaurant in town for one last hurrah before parting ways. Pak graciously and unexpectedly picked up the tab for the whole crew. Talk about some serious trail magic! I love trail magic even more when it is conducted by a hiker.

I stayed at the shelter with Atlas, Giggles, Cameron (SOBO flip/flopper), and Nathan (NOBO sectioner); the country boys were too lazy to hike the .2 miles to the shelter, but joined us after dinner and delivered more Werther's candy. Giggles was very happy to have finally been able to share a shelter with me after 24 days and was slightly condescending about my pace. She's 20 and goal-driven. I'm 30 and have adopted the motto ""fuck the future."" She's also planning on following me to Bear's Den hostel...this makes me slightly uncomfortable and annoyed.

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530237,"Today I rode part of the infamous ""rollercoaster,"" a 13.5 mile stretch with 11 tightly packed 300-500 foot ascents and descents, some with switchbacks and only one flat section. I passed two men hunting for Morel mushrooms, which look like a domed sponge, we well as a group of 4 individuals clad in camo, one accessorized with a can of Bush Light at 11:30 in the morning. A woman from this group ominously warned me of hiking alone on this trail. I find it annoying when people do this, especially when they suggest I carry a gun. I understand there are dangers in this world, especially as a single female in places where no one could hear me scream, but what kind of life is one dominated and dictated by fear? I am happy I do not live in that mindset; I am mindful, but not constricted. The rollercoaster slowed my pace to 2 miles an hour and I had to have a break 1/2 way through; my feet have begun to ache again, which is a bit upsetting. I arrived at the hostel hot, exhausted, and drenched with sweat. Atlas had already arrived and told me some kind soul had violated the ""no alcohol"" rule and left 2 Mikes Hard Black Cherry Lemonades, one of which he had drunk and the other of which he offered to me. I showered, drank, an had a smoke, after which I was exceptionally drunk, one of the many perks of thru-hiking (being a serious lightweight). I called my mom and waited an agonizing hour for the store to open upstairs so I could purchase the Hiker's Special: stay, laundry, pizza, ice cream, & soda for $30. Really, I just wanted the pizza. Though I felt I could have eaten 2, as I sat down to eat and watch a movie, I was only able to finish 3/4 of my pizza.

I finished the last bit of the rollercoaster, which seemed easier than the first 9.5 miles. I came across a Garter snake, which I mistook for a rubber toy until it moved just as I had decided to pick it up. Atlas and I flip-flopped until midday, when I heard, then saw, my first rattlesnake, resulting in me screaming before I jumped back, my heart pounding. I yelled for Atlas to come look, but he didn't hear me. The snake receded to the woods, leaving me to resume my hike. I met and chatted with a NOBO thru-hiker (Piggy) and his dog as well as a day hiker (Pat) and her dog. I decided to stop at the shelter even though it was early to take the time to read, reflect, and write. My new motto (the original being ""Don't die."") is ""Fuck the future, fuck the past; live in the now and have a blast."" I have always been a goal-driven person; focusing on reaching my destination while allowing the details to blur in order to focus on the bigger picture. I have accomplished a lot with this attitude and any would consider me a ""successful"" person. I've decided that while goals are great guidelines, they can blind you to the many possible avenues to reach your destination as well as alternate destinations. Life is like art; an ever evolving piece capable of repeated improvements or a complete makeover. I began the hike with an Excel spreadsheet, which was tossed in the first week. I then began planning short sections at a time, eventually simply planning day to day. Now, I make sure I have a good bit of a food, a vague idea, and live moment to moment, allowing each experience to influence future decisions. I have never been able to live this way; ""real life"" encompasses so much responsibility to others. I am a giver and have not been able to find a balance between my needs and the needs of others, leaving me perpetually drained and aloof during social interactions. On the trail, I literally have no idea what I may be doing an hour in the future and I love the feel of that freedom. No goals, no expectations, just feeling happy right now.P.S. While eating dinner, a woman arrived and asked if there was room at the shelter. I said there was, but a red flag went up when I noticed she was wearing a large winter coat and blue jeans and was sporting Walmart gear. Generally, these signs indicate a person is likely homeless. Although this made me a bit wary (I do hate to admit I do have negative preconceived ideas of what it means to be homeless), I've met other seemingly homeless persons along the trail with no issues. Sweeper and I continued to eat dinner at the pavilion while the woman sat on the shelter's porch talking to Giggles. Sweeper went to get something from the shelter and came back reporting the woman (Nancy) was not actually talking to Gigges, who was plugged in to her phone...we listened closer to hear her jabbering on about the Air Force kidnapping people and Rangers conspiring against her...I decided the woman was likely crazy and didn't feel like sharing a shelter with her, so I shoveled what food I could down my throat before asking Giggles if she wanted to night hike (Sweeper opted to hang his hammock under the pavilion). Giggles jumped at the opportunity to leave, so we packed up while Nancy intermingled conversations with us and conversations with herself. She informed us Rangers didn't like you to carry weapons on the trail, but that it was okay to carry a stun gun; she had a stun gun she had purchased at Cabela's. As soon as our bags were packed, we beasted away from the shelter, Giggles panting and barely able to keep up with me. When we were a safe distance away, I stopped to report the woman to the local authorities.

Ben (Hostel caretaker) made waffles, but I had to chipmunk mine in order to make the shuttle to the train station. Two other thru-hikers (Time Out & Candle Maker) were also venturing to the capital. The train station looked like a movie set and I was unable (and did little) to hide my child-like awe of the commuter train. The rocking was nauseating at first, but I enjoyed the hour-long ride. With each stop, exponentially more and more passengers packed into the compartments. It was ""take your child to work"" day. I exited the train at Union Station in a sea of passengers who all looked like they knew what they were doing, so I joined the herd and made my way to Massachusetts Avenue. Thank goodness for Google Maps! There's no way I could have navigated the 1.5 miles to the hostel using a map. The streets in DC are fairly organized in a grid system, though the streets with names (as opposed to letters and numbers) ran in a diagonal and haphazard manner. After arriving at the hostel, I organized my pack, updated my trail journal, shopped at the nearby grocery store, and got the scoop on a local barber and gay bar from Marvin, one of the hostel employees.i also had a very odd, but interesting experience in which I was asked a favor for a group of educational representatives from the Dominican Republic of Congo which went a bit like this:Man: ""Can you please do a favor for me?""Me: ""Maybe. What is it?""Man: ""I have this chicken I bought (shows me a rotisserie chicken) that I would like to eat, but it is cold.""Me: ""Well, there's a microwave in the kitchen...""Man: ""I've never used one and do not know how to operate it.""Me: ""Okay. (Demonstrates how to use the microwave) You may want to cut up the chicken first so the pieces are heated evenly. ""Man: ""Stares at me blankly.""Me: ""Have you never cut up a chicken?""Man: ""No, my wife does all the cooking. I just do the eating.""Me: (Resisting the urge to roll my eyes or be a smart ass and embrace multiculturalism) Okay, well I can do that for you, but I'm from the south and just use my hands.""Man: Smiles as I pull apart his chicken and heat up the pieces. ""Thank you very much. Will you please join us for dinner?""Me: ""No thanks, I was just about to leave.""Other man: ""I have two beers left, one for me, and one for you!""I was unable to decline the invitation before the beer was opened and placed in my hand, so I shared a few words with the group as I sipped the Heineken that was given to me in exchange to my culinary favor. I headed out and had a drink and dinner at Nellies, which is a gay SPORTS bar. Despite its contradictory nature, it had a great atmosphere, good tunes, and cute bartenders. I left before the DJ arrived to get me head shaved at Showtime Barbers, which was less than a block away. ""Why shave your head?"" you may wonder...Well, I've always felt it would be liberating from vanity...I was only halfway able to accomplish this, as I felt the need to ostentatiously have the AT logo etched in the back (the main reason for my trip to DC was to have a barber proficient in etching). I sat and waited over an hour in an all-male, black barbershop and thought I may have stuck out like a sore thumb, I assimilated well, and was taking shots and green blazing before the cut was complete. The patron who filmed the event ""That's gonna look damn sexy!"" as the first locks fell to the floor (which was counterproductive to my vanity liberation). I not only felt sexy, as suggested, I felt empowered and slightly buzzed. Afterwards, a young and very attractive man propositioned me, further enlarging my newly bald head.","Harper's Ferry, WV

I walked to the nearest Metro subway station, put a bit of extra cash on the card I had received from the hiker box in Harper's Ferry (my success of which was announced to the nearby workers and commuters), and boarded my first solo subway trip (again, thank you Google maps!). I accidentally exited on the wrong stop, but an attractive young woman helped direct me to the correct train, boarded with me, and chatted me up until learning I was married, a fact which brought obvious disappointment. I'm definitely getting big-headed about my shaved head at this point. I left the bus at the Pentagon (doesn't it seem odd to have a stop here?), where I was told by armed guards I could not take photos, with the exception of the Pentagon Memorial...so of course I waited until I didn't see a ""no photo/ no drone zone"" sign and took a photo of the Pentagon. I walked to the bus stop, which is across from the public entrance to the Pentagon, and caught a bus to REI. Though it was small and didn't have much staff, those there were extremely nice and helpful; one man purchased some Ova Easy eggs and put them in hot water to see if they would rehydrate without cooking, a hopeful hypothesis of mine as these eggs invariably stick to the pot when you cook them. The experiment failed, but I still purchased the eggs along with an assortment of over-priced and unnecessary foods. Pro tip: never go to REI while hungry with your dividends in hand. I also exchanged my Darn Tough socks; after three years and half the trail, I had succeeded in wearing them thin! I was so proud. Afterwards, I grabbed some McDonalds and boarded a bus back to the hostel, where I would be checking in to my new bunk. I shared a room with a group of Swedish student teachers, who were all very lively and sociable. After dinner from the Mexican restaurant next door and drinks at the hostel, I hit the streets again, this time with Cobalt, a gay dance club, as my final destination. The place was basically deserted when I arrived; when I mentioned this to the bartender, he informed me it would pick up once the free vodka started at 11. Like cows at feeding time, the herd trampled in just as predicted and the dance floors were packed once the lines at the bars had died down. I joined the rest, losing myself in the rhythm and the words of some of my favorite songs of the 2000s. At times, an empty circle would form around me, and I wondered if it may be due to my particular hiker aroma, but I didn't care; I danced my heart's content as the star on my own personal dance floor. As a side note, hiking the AT is nothing compared to dancing with a gay boy in terms of exercising your quads. After tiring myself out, I walked back to the hostel under a pink sky. P. S.

After lunch, the clouds looked dark and heavy, so I put on my pack cover and successfully warded off the rain. The trail was full of puddles, resulting in walking along the edge of the trail to avoid soaked shoes and feet; once while doing just that, I nearly stepped on a rattlesnake sunning and apparently asleep. Seam tried to get it to move off the trail by poking it and tossing rocks at it, which only pissed it off and resulted in the snake cooking into striking position.

NEGATIVE RANT: People who seem to have an ""educated"" comment about everything discussed by everyone (even those whose conversation did not initially involve the know-it-all) really get on my last fucking nerve. You aren't full of knowledge, you are full of shit and look like a fucking dumbass when someone has to call you out on it. Also, people who justify leaving trash in fireplaces as ""tinder"" for others...it's fucking TRASH other people have to pick up. While some trash is organic and compostable, the fireplace (or the forest) are not compost bins or pits. If you are going to dispose of organic waste so that it may decompose, bury it; yes, it will decompose naturally on the surface level, but it will take several days or weeks to do so, during which time I may come across your smelly pile of shit or a bear may come across your teabag and develop a ""taste"" for human food, essentially signing its death warrant. In short, trash kills bears and detracts from the beauty of nature. Please don't be a punk ass motherfucker; if you hiked it in full, it's hella easy to hike it out empty. P.S. The topics of conversation today included which group member(s) we would cannibalize and in what order as well as the manufacturing(?) and distribution of used hiker undies (If you're interested and great at marketing, let me know! I seriously think I could fund the rest of my hike with smelly panties.)","Ironmasters Mansion Hostel

I have hugs and said bye to the crew who claimed they were going to hike 14 miles after loading up with beer at Boiling Springs...I've got a petty good nose for bullshit. I hiked through a few hills before the stench of chicken shit (shit everywhere!) permeated the air as climbed down to Cumberland Valley, home of many crop fields. I picked up a bag of trash left just before the fields began and toted it on my hiking pole, looking like a runaway kid from the 1900s. My shoes were soon soaked in the shit-covered field and I felt confident the ticks that normally stalked its prey from the tips of blades of grass wouldn't be bothering me today as an AT info plaque declared the pastoral lands I had entered were periodically sprayed with pesticides. Great. Shit and poison before even eating breakfast. I dumped the trash at Boiling Springs and stopped at the ATC before heading to Cafe 101. I wanted a biscuit, but I knew my odds were slim. I ended up ordering Eggs Benedict twice, but gave up after they brought me runny whites followed by hard yolk and settled for a sausage egg and cheese croissant. I saw the crew again and they again said they'd see me at the shelter later. I filled up my water (there isn't any available for 10 miles) and headed out, stopping at Scott's Farm for a snack before finishing the 4 miles to the shelter, passing Nancy and an d wrecked car. I saw Flash 52 and Johnny Cash at the shelter and met Rockever, Governor, & No Worries. A section hiking couple arrived later, the male half of which was passively aggressively not a fan of my opinions and felt no need to engage in a constructive conversation or debate. Just before dark, two girls came in after having hiked a marathon (26 mile) day. Although we didn't chat much, I decided I really liked Rockever's vibe and was a little sad I wouldn't get to hike on with him.","Alex Kennedy Shelter

I ran into Tofer, whom I had left in Glascow and seriously believed would never see again. He informed me he was now ""Backbone"" and offered to buy me a beer at The Doyle, which definitely looked a bit dilapidated from the outside. I was drunk after 1 beer (I love hiking!). I ate some wings and rings before getting a lift to Harrisburg for my bus ride home. I didn't really want to come off trail so early, especially since my step-daughter's graduation wasn't until the 21st, but this seemed to be the easiest place to enter and exit in the state of PA. I had a few hours to kill, so I walked around the capital collecting some food for the ride and some slices of Sicilian pizza for dinner. I popped Benadryl while overhearing a woman talk about eating pussy to any man in the terminal unfortunate enough to be in close proximity. I had some me explain my ticket to me and boarded the bus, forced to take an aisle seat. After many attempts to sleep thwarted by the dropping of my head, I sat on the floor in front of my seat and sleeps with my head on the chair. We were asked to exit the bus in Pittsburg, PA for cleaning and I managed to get a window seat when re-boarding, enabling me to get a few winks. I woke up confused in Columbus at 2am, when we again had to briefly leave the bus. I switched busses in Cincinnati at 2:30 and slept off an on until arriving in Louisville, where we picked up some Amish folk, who were dropped off in Sonora, KY at the bus station/post office/feed store.

Part of my reasoning for coming home was to do just this, as well as to finish up the second half of the Smokies. Mainly, I was coming home to see my family, my step-daughter graduate, and my step-godson get married. Somewhere around Knoxville, I passed public school busses which had advertisements along the side; I was disturbed that a school system would have to turn to outside funds in this way in order to provide what's necessary for academic, social, and emotional growth, though excited they had the wherewithal to do what was necessary to achieve that goal. Driving up and seeing the towering mountains made the hills in which I had been hiking seeming stark and insufficient to these majestic mountains. I can't explain why, but seeing these mountains effected a similar emotion in me to that when I see a woman's breasts; I am comforted and awed. I arrived at a hostel that had previously been blanketed in snow, but was now carpeted in tents. The place was packed and I hung out with other thru-hikers, sharing food, booze, and safety equipment. 6/17/16I woke up early with a slight hangover and got breakfast while I waited for my shuttle to Iron Mountain. Other hikers decided to slack pack back to the hostel as well, and the shuttle was full by the time it left. I had brought my dog, Eve (a min pin), with me and being the doll she is, she received many adorations from the thru hikers, especially seeing as how she was wearing a neon yellow rain jacket. We had a great hike with many beautiful sights, including blooming rhododendron and mountain laurel.

I relish the hours I spend each day not talking to anyone and having no one talk to me; the peaceful sounds of nature (or the occasional podcast/ jam session) are all the company I need for 8 hours a day. I was also excited to see my family and friends, though weary of the never-ending repetitive questions they would have about my journey. I answered each one as if a well-rehearsed script, knowing they could never fully grasp the magnitude of my experience. After only a few days, I was itching to get back to the woods to do some of the miles I had missed earlier. After I returned, reality hit me full force when I received a call from my wife that our son had been hit by a car while riding his bike to work. Though I was fearful, I didn't allow my mind to contemplate the many possibilities of his condition while driving to meet Annie at the hospital. I arrived to find him conscious, with only a broken thumb, some stitches above his eye and in his lip, and a bruised leg. Ecstatic no serious injuries had occurred, my wife and I went home to prepare for our daughter's high school graduation that weekend. I, of course, cried at the ceremony, so proud of this major accomplishment and knowing she would soon leave to set out on an adventure of her own halfway around the world. Just before the graduation party, I received a call from my mom informing me my grandmother was in the hospital with what they believed to be a mild heart attack and UTI. My mom didn't want me to leave the party, but I felt torn. Either decision (leave the party to see my grandmother or stay to celebrate my daughter) would upset someone, myself included. I chose to stay for the evening and left my mother and uncle to watch after my grandmother, but went to visit my mother and grandmother at the hospital the next day, taking the night shift to stay with her. Though I had planned to hike the section of the Smokies I had missed that week, I decided to hang around to offer support for my mom. My grandmother improved after a few rounds of antibiotics and they were able to move her to a rehab facility until she was stable enough to return to the Alzheimer's unit of a nursing home. Annie and I spent the next weekend alone celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary a month early since she would be in California visiting her son and I would be back on the trail. This was an absolutely magical weekend filled with love and laughter (and a few tears). The next week, I prepped for my return to the trail after a pit-stop in Knoxville to my godson's wedding, which was amazing in every single way. Annie drove me back to PA, with a side trip along Skyline Drive through Shenandoah National Park and a pit stop at the Sheraton Hotel (thanks for the cheap room Priceline!)

There were quite a few beautiful overlooks on the way up to Clarks Ferry Shelter, where I stopped to lunch and water. Though the 85 degrees were nothing compared to the 93 degrees and humidity of Tennessee, I found myself drinking more water than usual. The rocks weren't that bad, only a few really rocky sections. I arrived at Peters Mountain Shelter just after 5pm and decided I had hiked enough for the day. The .2 miles to the water was definitely the most difficult bit of the day and someone had left their undies on a rock along the trail (yuk!). I realized I had left my safety equipment in the car with my wife (sad face!), but also discovered a hidden 1/2 pint of whiskey in my pack, so all is well for now.

Only a mile later, I discovered two 16oz PBRs in a spring and shared one with Black Santa. I stopped for lunch and my break was cut short by a brief rain shower that stopped as soon as I had packed everything away. I hiked on for a bit, but had to stop to rest my throbbing feet.

This made more since of why he thought I should have been the one to stay at home paying the mortgage while my wife got to hike the trail. Ah, misguided stereotypes.

I took a break at William Penn Shelter to again dry my feet, which had begun to ache considerably by this point. I took some aspirin for a headache caused either by my pack or the mile-long rock stretch before the shelter. I pushed on to 501 Shelter and only experienced one rocky section. 501 was packed!

I took a break at Hertline campsite and received some homemade turkey jerky from a former thru hiker and contact information for one of her hiking partners who was a farmer and offered to help me become a farmer (I had mentioned this may be what I want to be when I grow up). It was quite precious; she didn't have any paper, so she wrote her info down on a page of the bible which contained her favorite scripture. I need to find someone who knows about bibles to tell me where the scripture begins. While sitting and chatting with the farmer girl, I was hit by a fallen tree limb, then left going down the wrong trail. These were foreshadowing events for the emotional breakdown of my own that would soon occur. I missed my wife and was sick of the pain in my head and my feet. Transitioning back to trail life is difficult; going from one extreme of comfort to the other of deprivation. It was this deprivation which caused me to yearn to the repose I feel when with my loving wife. One goal I have for myself while being on the trail is to live independently. While I have done this financially for years, I've never been without a partner since becoming an adult, so I've always had someone to lean on for emotional support. Although a therapist would say it's healthy to turn to others for support during times of need, there's a fine line between support and co-dependence. Either way, I want to be able to learn to look within myself more for strength during trying times. I told myself not to cry; it would blur my vision, undoubtedly resulting in a crash collision with the rocks below. I finally decided to put my earbuds in and drown out the ""I miss my wife"" mantra in my head.

The barbershop in Port Clinton was truly epic, with a pet chicken hanging outside and coffee and donuts inside.

I stopped by the hostel, which was for donation and very minimalistic before getting a text from Layers with our hotel room number. I stopped by the PO to pick up my blonde boxes before heading to the Pocono Inn.

I showered and went into town for food with Layers, stopping first at the Apple Pie Bakery for a hot dog and a slice of pie for only $2.95. Two other thru-hikers were there, one of whom made some judge mental remarks about the length of my thru-hike, which I was able to politely ignore. I feel the AT thru-hike isn't solely about putting one foot in front of the other for 8-12 hours a day; it's not solely about getting to Kathadin; it's not solely about the miles you average. These are only part of the multifaceted experience that is thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail. There's also the towns you visit, the vistas, the people, the parties, the pain & sickness, the injuries, the loneliness, the gear, the blazes (white, blue, Aqua, yellow, pink, green, etcetera) and (most importantly) the food. If all I did was hike for 5 solid months, I'd go insane. Hiking gets BORING. Sometimes ya gotta spice it up a bit. This is why the motto ""Hike Your Own Hike"" is so important. It's a journey; everyone is different and what people need from their own personal pilgrimage will be as unique as they are.

Sunfish Pond is a glacial lake (huh?) whose high acidity enables only two types of fish to survive in its waters.

Even though I can smell the raspberries, they aren't ready just yet. I decided to get a gatoraid at Culvers Gap and was sucked into the vortex that is Gyps Tavern, where I had some great conversations with Butterscotch, Sunshine, and Grassman. Sunshine was conflicted about her relationship with her hiking buddy she'd had since beginning at Harper's Ferry. The concept of ""trail families"" is something I've been thinking about a lot recently. When I first got back on the trail, I longed for a group or a partner; people who would consistently be in my life and with whom I could develop deep, long-lasting relationships; people to support me through the hard times and celebrate once those times had passed. I enjoyed the four days I spent with Layers, but I think I will always just be a solo hiker. I find it difficult to conform to the ideas of a group. I enjoy the freedom of hiking as fast/slow and as far/or not as I choose. I love being able to change my plans 10 times a day as various opportunities present themselves, or to have no plan at all.

I get to be selfish instead of selfless. I love it!PS. I discovered the owner of the sweet Opinel knife I had found at a shelter (and recently mailed home to myself).

My first mile was great, but I became tired quickly and with each hour, my pace dropped and I had to take breaks just to cool down. I didn't believe it when my thermometer only read 77. I stopped by the High Point State Park Headquarters, registered, got a coke & candy, and chatted with Grassman before heading towards the beach. I got a bit lost going to the beach, but eventually found my way to the concession stand and ordered a hot dog, fries, and onion rings. After stuffing my face, I plunged into the ice cold water with my hiking clothes on and had the air expelled from my lungs. Less than a minute later, my teeth were chattering uncontrollably so I cut my swim to a dip and took a hot shower in the bathrooms, washing some of my clothes as well as my body. I figured my bra and underwear looked enough like a bikini, so I payed under a tree for a bit and worked out a plan to hike 18-12-22 mile days to get to the shelter with the NYC overlook. That plan fell through within 30 minutes of hiking when I decided to stay at the shelter rather than pushing for the full 18 miles. Because of this, I was able to meet Mass, a thru-hiker from MA (though that's not how he got his name) who hooked me up with some safety equipment he had found on the trail.

I stopped in Unionville, NY and spent the afternoon at Wits End Tavern until the day cool off. Since it didn't open until noon, I stopped into Horler's Store to pick up a few items at inflated prices. I had a great breakfast sandwich, but the rest of the resupply options were fairly slim. After eating and charging my phone, I headed to the tavern and had a beer with Massasoiet (aka Mass) and Tea Time. Mass left after a beer and a salad and Tea Time left soon after. I called my dads to wish them a Happy Pappy Day, ate a salad and wings, and hung out with Tea Time, who had hiked only a mile up trail before returning to the tavern (he said his stomach hurt). I had one more beer and chatted with a local (Tracy) at the bar, who bought me a shot of Peach Dog Whiskey (yum!). Afterwards, I road walked to where the trail picks up at the Walkhill Reserve and felt as if I were in Florida. The Reserve was amazing and beautiful, but the hike uphill to the shelter was not.

The NJ boardwalk was spectacular and I was able to meet Bambi, a super sweaty and inquisitive, though not game to let a human pet her. I climbed the Stairway to Heaven and met some firefighters who had to haul a hose up the steep and rocky path to put out a log that had caught fire. Bless their hearts. I stopped at the Pinwheels Vista for a brief break and saw my first (and only) NJ bear shortly after returning to the trail. It was if large stature, but scurried off when it heard another hiker approaching. I took an extended lunch break at Wawayanda Shelter, cooking some couscous (yum!), rehydrating as much as possible, and taking a short nap. The privy was full, but I used it anyway. Afterwards, I set my goal for the NJ/NY border. It was 6 by the time I arrived in NY, so I knew I wouldn't make it to the next shelter.

I ended up off trail somewhere around Buchanon Mtn road, following a rocky road around a lake for more than 30 minutes before I realized I was supposed to have access to the lake and thought to look for a blaze. Luckily, I was able to use the contour lines to find a gully, then a creek flowing downhill and the GPS feature of the Guthook app to bushwhack for 15 minutes to a road, which led back to the trail. When lost in the woods, go downhill until a water source; it will lead you to civilization eventually. I took a well-earned break at Little Dam Lake and had chipmunks scurry underneath me, disrupting my relaxing smoke. Still feeling dehydrated, all I wanted was a watermelon and a salt shaker. Shortly thereafter, I stumbled upon a sweet Trail Magic setup at the Orange Turnpike: a patio table with chairs, a citronella candle, jugs of cool water, a trash can, and a bucket of fresh apples and bananas. This, of course, resulted in tears of joy and love for the altruism of some individuals. The water that has been left at some of the trailheads has been a true blessing and I am so incredibly thankful. I loaded up on water, ate a banana, took an apple for the trail, and attempted to carry a gallon of water over Arden mountain. Again, these NY rocky climbs are very challenging, especially when toting 10 lbs of water. At 7, I decided to call it quit and stealth camped on the mountain.","campsite @ 1367.4

I truly wonder what people think happens to the trash they throw on the ground, or if they even do. In my deliriously tired and hungry state of mind, I chow to stay at the Bear Mountain Inn despite the exorbitant cost. All the rooms in the main building were booked, so I took a room in the Overlook Lodge, which was across the lake. I ate some pasta and chatted with my wife while walking through the zoo, which featured the flora and fauna of the AT. Afterwards, I went to my room, took a shower, washed my clothes in the shower, and set off for some food and booze in Fort Montgomery, NY. The bridge was under construction, so I would have had to take a side trail to reach Cheshire Matt in order to acquire said desired items. I didn't feel like waking. I called an Uber, but the driver said it wasn't worth it; I asked a couple in the parking lot, but they had a graduation party to attend; I walked along the shitty rocky side trail to the Fort Montgomery State Historic Site wearing Crocs, no bra, and no undies, and asked the first person I saw for a lift to the Mart. He obliged and I spent $45 on shitty gas station food and beer. I also received 4 packets of oatmeal on the house.

I packed up and headed to the main Inn for the continental breakfast, where I ran into Tinker filling his tank in true Tinker fashion (stuffing everything he can into his stomach). We ate and chatted over breakfast, Tinker revealed he was gay and explained how hiking the trail had made him more open minded: ""I figured-I was gay; I had to be open minded. But there are so many people on the trail I'd never come into contact with in real life, including you: a woman with a wife. "" I assured him I'd also never had the opportunity to meet someone like him: a 70 year old man with a beard like Gandalf and the appetite of a 15 year old. I truly love the open community of the trail; it is truly live and let live.

In general, be who you are and do what you want within reasonable and respectful limits of others and the trail. After breakfast, I crossed the Hudson River (way cool) and became completely drenched in sweat climbing the hill afterwards; I think it must have been the beer leaving my body because the elevation profile did not show a difficult climb. I stopped for lunch at the Appalachian Trail Deli, ordering a Philly Cheesesteak on a ""roll."" I put role in quotes because in the south, a roll is a ring but of sweet and/or buttery bread served with dinner. The things they call rolls in the north are these pillowy puffs of bread with a slight crunch to the crust. In other words, fucking amazing shit!

The man asked me if I had a reservation because the park was full. Just as my jaw hit the desk, he said he was just kidding, and offered some water and Italian ice to soften the blow he had nearly dealt.

Pro tip: there's a pinkish/purplish (I'm color blind, so it's something in the red/purple family of colors) E of the trail as you cross the road which has three spigots with hot and cold water; the house looks abandoned, but it was suggested by Guthook and it's not in the AWOL guide. I received an orange soda, a sucker, and two beers from Tater Tot's family who had come to pick up Lil'Bear, so I was thankful for my tired legs.

I didn't mind the incline that accompanied the shade as it was infinitely cooler uber the cover of the leaves. I met some kids who had started their flip-flop an hour earlier and appeared to be chaperoned by a father figure. I stopped for water at Wiley Shelter before crossing into CT. A note on the water pumps in NY: while extremely convenient to have a reliable water source, the water tastes highly metallic since the pumps are decades old and seem to need to a good dose of WD-40; additionally, there's a warning sign posted by the ATC & National Park Services warning that the water contains Coliform Bacteria. Lovely. After taking a teary photo at the NY/CT border, I pushed up Ten Mile Hill (which really is only a mile of hiking...). The climb was tough, but the reward priceless: a tranquil campsite along the Ten Mile River (I wonder how long it actually is...). I dropped my pack, grabbed my beer, and immediately headed to the river, completely submerging myself in the cool running water. As I began wiping the grime off my body, I noticed on of my beers floating away, so I scrambled over slick, sludge covered rocks and saved the Coors from loss.

I quickly grew tired of that, so I switched to my next favorite coping skill: alcohol and food. The burger at the lodge was not nearly as good as the breakfast, but I ate it all just the same. I finished up OITNB, began my new book, and chatted with some other hikers before I finally heard from my wife, who had been at a beach in Oregon with no service.

I stopped in Williamstown for 50% off a pizza at Papa Johns and to pick up a few supplies at the grocery store. I again ran into Tea Time, who is still pushing big miles to catch up with his friends, but running into me instead. I met another section hiker, Timber, who ended up sharing the shelter with me that evening. I've now crossed into Vermont and have only 3 states left! The mental game is in full swing now hiking is a job I am ready to quit. Sometimes I become hyper focused on the miles to Katahdin. Is getting harder and header to focus on the beauties of the trail.

I stopped at Congdon shelter to air out my feet and eat an early lunch. I chatted a hit with Timber and Mariposa, a flip-flopper I had met briefly when leaving the lodge the previous day. I left the shelter to the sound of distant thunder and what began as a sprinkle turned into a full force thunderstorm. The tail became a torrent and I kept thinking ""now why can't the water sources be more like the trail?"" I soon became completely soaked from the waste down and the pad I was wearing began to chafe my no-no zone. I decided to take off the pad since I was almost through with my period anyway, which resulted in a very uncomfortable burning as I walked. This combined with the squish of my feet through the puddles which were unavoidable led to the decision I would get off trail to dry out before more rain hit. I ran into Mariposa just before the parking lot and she asked if I needed anything since her husband was there with a car (he was slack packing her.) I said I was good unless they happened to be going into town. They seemed to deliberate as I looked at my guide to determine which hotel I'd be visiting and decided to leave without saying a word. I found that to be rather shitty of them. Just as I was preparing to hitch, a man (Mark) pulled up with two hikers who had apparently gotten lost. I asked if he would mind giving me a lift to a motel and he obliged, running me to two other motels before finding one that had vacancy and was in my price range. I got a room and immediately took a hot shower and changed into dry clothes. Though it wasn't that cold (about 60 on the mountain) I was freezing from being so soaked. I washed my clothes in the shower and hung them over the heater to dry.

Being the first one up and out of the shelter meant I was silk blazing the first 4.6 miles. I don't like silk blazing; I feel like I must look like I'm on meth, constantly picking the strands away from my face, arms, and legs...or perhaps a robot with my hiking poles swinging up and down in front of me in a vein attempt to swat the silk away before it makes contact with my body. I decided to stop by Story Springs Shelter after a major wipeout to regain my self and possibly allow someone to pass me...my desire was eventually actualized and the webs were replaced with mud: large patches and stretches of black mud varying in viscosity. Vermud is much like Rocksylvania; at first you're thinking ""This isn't that bad. I don't know what everyone is bitching about."" But then you understand and think: ""What the fuck is wrong with the people who design and maintain this trail?"" I ran into Flash 52 today at lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. I think he gets funnier the longer I know him. I was also the lucky recipient of a brownie and Annie's Gummies, which I shared with another hiker, California Chrome before heading to the top of Stratton Mountain and up the tower. The views from these towers over pine forests are something to behold. I headed down to Stratton Pond Shelter, shared with Flash 52, Mud Up, Hummingbird, Olivia, Tim?, California Crome, and Something with a C. The sunset over Stratton Pond was something to behold as well. The trail sucks, but the ends most certainly justify the means. PS. Slept in my tent to avoid mice and mosquitos. PPS.

I got a ride to the post office from a chick who was about to leave her job so she could go to concerts across the country. Her car also smelled like pot; or at least, I think it was her. The lady at the post office was super stingy on the tape and was exasperated by the smaller post offices that gave it away for free despite explicit instructions not to; think of the costs! Shipped my shit, then went in search of food and landed in a McDonalds, where they featured a lobster sandwich. Only in the northeast. I ordered everything they had on the ""Pick 2 for $2.50"" and a coke and sat to ""plan"" out the next few days. I may be in The Whites in a week. The Whites. A week. Shit got a little real.

A guy asked if I needed a lift at a red light, and I accepted the offer. I was in the middle of a minivan that had its seats removed wearing my pack while this guy zoomed up and around the mountain to the parking lot, into which he skidded to a screeching stop, sending my face into the headrest of the seat in front of my and my phone from me. A bit dazed, but thankful nonetheless, I started up the trail, chatting briefly with some day hikers about my flight into the parking lot and my hike. I quickly downed a soda left by the Green Mountain Hostel, a hostel in town, and chatted with a SOBO LT hiker. Oh yeah, so that's a thing now. In addition to the ""Are you NOBO/SOBO/Section/Thru"" you also ask what trail- AT/LT. Of those at my shelter last night, 4 were NOBO AT, 1 SOBO LT, 3 NOBO LT. So many letters. I stopped at the shelter on the way up and got some water and good company. A couple passed and said that the ski hut was trashed and smelled, but I decided I'd make whatever work somehow. Toting 3 liters of water was a bit difficult up what seemed to be pretty steep inclines, one of which I stopped and turned around for the most magnificent view. Bromley Mountain is pretty sweet; there's two ski lifts, a ski warming hut (that did have a particular odor but was by no means trashed), and amazing 360 views, though you could see storm clouds brewing.

Mike had a little gurmtar which I strummed along to, then tossed aside so I could dance to the music he put on the radio. We passed the Cog (the train which takes people to the summit of Mt.

The trail (aka ""life"") can be vicious and cruel, but is ultimately beautiful in its own intricate way. Even the ugliest parts have an endearing quality. Climbing up or sliding down rocks, walking through hail and lightning, walking through snow: you feel stronger and more agile, you are able to seek shelte and change into dry clothes, you are able to survive emotional breakdown after emotional breakdown.

GarfieldTook a shower and ate bowls of CapNCrunch before heading to McDonalds to attempt to download some music to my new phone. I grabbed some sausage burritos for lunch and made my way to North Woodstock to hitch. By this time, my stomach started to growl,so I stopped to get a breakfast sandwich that cost me $8. Shoulda bought mas burritos. I got a hitch pretty quickly from a fellow Tennessean and took the blue blaze from the parking lot. I've decided bonus miles should count double in The Whites. Hiking out of the notch was pretty strenuous, so I took a break at Liberty Campsite. Coming out of the treeline brought tears to my eyes. Franconia Ridge was absolutely spectacular, though riddled with day hikers. Garfield Ridge was equally impressive and I was able to catch a glimpse of Mt. Washington. I debated staying at Garfield Shelter, but I passed a large group of teenagers and decided to push on and stealth for the night.","Franconia Notch

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544381,"7/28 stealth site- stealth site 0.4 from Zealand Hut (9.6)The hike this AM wasn't too bad, and I made good time to Galehead Hut. I stopped to claim any breakfast leftovers, and was rewarded with a plate of scrambled eggs and oatmeal topped with peaches and brownie crumbles. This fueled me up the strenuous 0.8 to South Twin Peak, which took me 50 minutes to ascend. Damn. From there I was able to gaze proudly upon what I had hiked the previous day and what I would be climbing in a few days, Mt. Washington, which was (of course) in the clouds. I ended up hiking with Soup for a bit until I led us 0.6 on the wrong trail. He chose to hike by himself after that. I started to tire, so I took a bit of a lunch break, though I wasn't actually hungry. I noticed I had less than half a liter of water and 4 miles until the next water source. Dehydration is a bitch. I was very spacey and borderline deletions, not that that is much different from how I usually feel, but at a greater intensity. After my break, I again ran into Soup, who thought he was lost, but wasn't. We hiked on to the hut, hoping to get there just after the suggested one of 3pm to ask for work for stay. The cook informed us we were too early; apparently each hut makes up their own time. This hut's time happened to be 5:30. Soup and I hung out while a light storm blew through and chatted with those more fortunate. I was gifted three dehydrated meals and some bars by said fortunate individuals. Jeff (the previous owner of the dehydrated meals) even offered to pick Soup and I up from Crawford Notch the next day and take us out to lunch. I've never been much of a mooch and tend to look down upon those who engage in mooching activities, but with my funds nearing their end, I've decided to accept any and all charity bestowed upon me. After checking back in at 5:30 and told again we were not allowed to work for stay, I took down Jeff's number and headed to a stealth camp suggested by one of the other hut crew members. I ended up camping with a group of 13 year old girls from a YMCA camp I had run into earlier in the day.","

My foot hurt. The trail between the hut and Ethan Pond is amazing: mostly flat, wide, and loaded with blueberries. Ethan Pond was pretty, but the shelter sucked. The hike down to the notch wasn't too bad, but foot progressively got worse. Hitched a ride to Crawford Notch Campground and ran into Soup,who had called Jeff. Jeff and Michelle picked us up and took us out for lunch, then dropped Soup off at a motel and me at the campground. I hitched back to the trailhead (45 minutes) around the time of the shuttle. Learned you had to call to arrange the shuttle. Met a SOBO, Tourist, who went with me to the hostel. Saw a moose on the side of the road. Rode with Jeremiah and George. After arriving, went in search of food and ice, which I procured at the pizza place a block down and the movie theatre across the street.

Not sure if it was good food, rest, fear of being stuck above treeline in a thunderstorm, or the (most likely) steroid I took for my foot, but I hauled major ass. Sweaty as fuck at Webster cliffs, after which I stowed my poles and did many rock scrambles. Stopped at Mizpah Hut for some leftover chicken and got to sit in on a jam session featuring a hut croo member and a thru-hiker (Juanderer), which brought tears to my eyes. Fucking beautiful coming up to the presidentials. Also brought tears to my eyes. I kept Washington in sight all day, my goal getting closer and closer. I ran into Thunderbolt, gave him a hug, and chatted a bit. He said Bruce aka ""still kickin"" broke his leg. I felt no sympathy for him. He should have never called me a bitch. I ate many blueberries and giggled when I finally caught sight of the hut. I was offered work for stay (my first yet!) and was told I could hang out until after dinner. I sat by the pond and chatted with my step dad and mom. I hung out with thru hikers and played a card game (Dutch blitz) with some regular people. I feasted on leftovers, then cleaned the fridge as my work. I played more cards until lights out. People continued to talk loudly, so sleep was not an option.

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544927,"Today I was colder than I can remember being in quite some time, if not ever. But that's not how it started, and I like journaling in chronological order. This time I didn't. Trying new things. We were told the thunderstorms were now just a slight chance of rain in the afternoon by the hut members during the morning weather announcement. The rain began at 10am, shortly after I summered Mt. Washington and before I had begun my descent. It was a grey drizzle at first, much like the mist acquired while walking through dense fog. I saw two girls (Croc and Lost and Found) who had stayed at the hut with me a bit ahead of me, so I picked up my pace to catch up with them. I put on my rain jacket once I began to hear the drops. We hiked on for awhile until noticing we were on a blue-blazed trail. At this point, I replaced Lost and Found as the navigator and used Guthook to bushwhack over the delicate alpine vegetation (so sorry about that) back to the trail. Along the way we picked up Juanderer, who had also taken the wrong trail. By this point I had decided to put on my rain pants as the rain had become a bit heavier and the air colder and more windy. Unfortunately, an older man (Jerry) had followed us but could not hear the cries to turn back, so Croc ran back along the trail to guide him. He hiked with us to the intersection of another trail, where he was going to meet his family. The four of us continued on, me leading the way, to Madison Hut, 3.8 miles away. 3.8 miles up, over, and down rocks: wet, lichen-covered rocks. I nearly face-planted three times and turtled once, the first turtle experience of my hike. (To turtle is to fall on one's back, landing on the pack, which is typically wedged in rocks making it difficult to get up without assistance.) We sang songs (or rather a few lines of songs) off key, ate food thanks to Lost and Found, and played word games to ease the pain of walking through a rain cloud for four hours, having to walk cairn to cairn, and not always being able to see the next one. Once we got to Madison Hut, we all changed into dry clothes and ate/drank hot things to raise our body temperatures. Other hikers were already there doing the same; one was wrapped in his down quilt. I had on my winter base layer, two fleece jackets, socks, a fleece hat, and a heavy woolen blanket. It took an hour for the cold to leave my bones. After changing our plans at least 6 times, Lost and Found, Croc, and I headed out for the tent site 0.6 from Madison Hut on Valley Way trail. After arriving at the site, we set up our tents and had a safety meeting in mine. We spent a good while engaging in ""girl talk,"" something I've not done much of lately. All-in-all, it was a great dreary day.","Lake of the Clouds Hut

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544930,"I woke up to the sun shining through my tent and decided I'd head down Valley Way Trail rather than the AT. I ended up with a nice gradual descent accompanied by several waterfalls. Fuck more rocks. I got a hitch from a weekender who had met me at Lake of the Clouds and was dropped off at Walmart. I set up a line in the parking lot to dry out my gear and ran into a couple of trail angels in their AT RV. They fed me ice cream, strawberries and cream, and helped me get safe before heading off to Grafton Notch to dole out trail magic. They were definitely an interesting couple with interesting views on the coming of a new Earth. I packed up my now dry gear and headed into Walmart to pick up resupply and spent a bit of time updating my journal in the Dunken Donuts. Afterwards, another interesting woman (Cheryl) picked me up and insisted on stopping for beer. Not wanting to be rude, I obliged and determined she was either more ADHD than myself or ingesting serious stimulants. After two beers, we spent a good 10 minutes going through her Facebook posts and pictures before heading towards the hostel, where I ran into Lost and Found & Big Foot. More free beers had been left in the fridge, so I continued to drink. Later that evening, a huge crowd of hikers descended upon Mr. Pizza (poor patrons) and had a wonderful time drinking, laughing, and eating.","Valley Way Tentsite

I felt extremely sluggish and my head did not respond to the aspirin or poweraid, so when we reached Carter Notch Hut and I saw a sign that read: Route 16- 3.8 miles, I knew what I had to do. It was at this point I realized I truly had no more fucks to give. Hiking is hiking. Traveling is traveling. I let go of the small twinge of guilt I felt about skipping another section of the Whites and reminded myself I am not out here to hike in misery; if I can find a way to make life easier and more enjoyable, you better fucking bet I will. I walked down the 19 mile trail to Route 16 and immediately got a hitch into town. I returned to the hostel, splurged on a bed, and sat down to watch a movie while eating Bagel Bites and Bugels.

Steve strolled by and I was able to say hello and give him a hug while I waited. I do love me some Steve. I hitched a ride to the trailhead and ran into Romani, so we hiked together for a bit, then parted ways at the base of Mt. Hayes. I ran into Romani and Croc again a bit later at a water source and ended up hiking on with them while listening to a podcast on blast about anal play. It was HILARIOUS! We passed by several people giggling to words and phrases such as ""I have the best hands for fisting,"" ""If a man pulls out a bag of toys, he's a keeper,"" and ""pegging,"" and ""anal bondage."" I'm pretty sure I was reliving my teenage years. It was fabulous. We stopped by Dream Lake, hoping to take a dip, but had no shoreline access. I said hey to Steve and then pushed on to Gentian Shelter, where Romani decided to continue on and I stopped with Croc. While having girl talk by the Pond another hiker (Solo) showed up and told us he had just seen a moose pass him on the trail, so we snuck off in search of said moose, who we found swimming at the north end of the pond munching on some sort of pond grass.

Hestia,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544933,"The plan today is to do 15 miles. I can't remember the last time I have hiked 15 miles. I'm about to do one of the most difficult sections of Maine...at the end of a 15 mile day over rough terrain. I'm fucking insane. I hiked with Croc and Solo and took many breaks throughout the day. It was hot and humid. The trail was excessively steep. Croc and I were exhausted, but pushed on to Full Goose Shelter and took an extended lunch break. A group of teenagers showed up mostly in their sports bras. We psyched ourselves up and (some-including me) drank some caffeine and headed for Mahoosuc Notch. For the longest time, I've had much anxiety about the Notch; I even brought my Xanex with me as I felt I wouldn't be able to handle the climb through boulder caves, squeezing myself and my pack through tight cracks. Everything I had built up in my mind was a complete fallacy. The Notch was by far the most fun mile of the trail. I felt like a superhero jumping from rock to rock and climbing through and above crevices with ice. The group I was with (Croc, Solo, and AJ) made it through in just over an hour and took a brief break before tackling the Mahoosuc Arm, which was a complete fucking bitch. It's seemingly doable at first, simple more Boulder climbing. Just after the campsite, it becomes sheets of vertical rock with spindly pine roots for climbing. I was exhausted and it was too much to handle. I ended up having a full blown panic attack halfway up the 1250 foot climb. My heart was already racing and my breathing was ragged, and then it all became a million times worse. I had no option, so I climbed on until the attack had passed and finally summited. I was still exceptionally emotional, so I drank a bit of water and continued on without my crew, who invariably caught up with me by the time I arrived at Speck Pond, which reflected the colors of the setting sun. At the shelter, some old weekenders had rudely commandeered the shelter, so Croc, Solo, and I shared a tent platform and filtered water for a camp of girls in exchange for water. I was able to chat briefly with Youngish (Alison) whom I'd met in Shenandoah and forced myself to eat dinner. I didn't end up crawling into bed until 10. Exhaustion.","Gentian Pond Shelter
