Black Squirrel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518872,"Whelp, here we go. The first step to commit myself to hiking the entire length of the A.T., from Georgia to Maine. My girlfriend and I plan on starting our epic 2189 mile journey from Springer Mountain on March 25th, 2017, which is also her birthday. She might create her own trail journal account sometime in the future. I'm starting mine today because I can hardly wait to get started. I hope to get better at making journal entries from now and through my thru hike. If anyone happens to read my entries, I hope you don't expect great writing or proper paragraphs and perfect grammar all the time. I prefer to just write what is on my mind and what I experience along the way, not worry about an entry sounding like something out of a published book. I'm not an author and I don't want to pretend I am. I cannot wait to get this started!! Many more steps to go and you will learn about them in future entries. Feel free to sign my guest book and say hi. I look forward to meeting many people along the way! Until next time, Happy New Year!! Randy",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Thu",0
Black Squirrel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518933,"Hey everyone, not much new going on this early in the stages. I've just been reading some other journals of 2016 thru hikers and checking out who the 2017 hikers will be. It's pretty fun for me to be anxious and excited for the 2016 hikers who are getting right down to their final preparations before it's go time. I wish them all luck and I'm looking forward to following their journey and learning from their experiences. Whether it's what not to do or a must do. I said earlier that I've been reading some of the 2017 hikers journals. That is particularly exciting for me because I imagine myself running into them from time to time. I even noticed someone with the same starting date of March 25th, 2017. That's really cool! We can do it! Katahdin or bust!!Randy",,#2,"Jan 02, Sat",0
Black Squirrel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522592,"It's been fun reading the journals. I'm a little jealous of this season's hikers. I'm anxious for those who are down to just days until their journey begins. I can't wait for that to be me next year about this time. Next year at this time I'll be 20 days away from starting my epic journey with my girlfriend. She doesn't know what her trail name is going to be yet, but I have decide on ""Black Squirrel"" for mine. That has to do with my hometown of Kent, Ohio. There is an interesting story regarding the high population of black squirrels in Kent. I can explain that some time in my ""trail name"" section.I'm excited to be taking a trip to Gatlinbug, TN in a couple weeks. My girlfriend and I are staying in a cabin for about a week from March, 19th through the 24th. We plan on hiking small sections of the A.T. while we're there. We'll probably do a short hike from Newfound Gap to Charlie's Bunion among others. One of the main reasons for our trip to Gatlinbrug is so we can set up a spot in the Newfound Gap parking lot to provide a little trail magic to the thru hikers passing by. We're gonna have a cooler with beer and pop and a lot of food and snacks. We can provide a ride to and from Gatlinburg if the hiker would like. In addition to that we are going to be in a pretty big cabin with a hot tub and sauna and extra room if some might want a place to stay for a night. I would just like to hear their stories so far and find out how they're enjoying the journey. Looking forward to meeting some of the hikers I've been reading about.

Black Squirrel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526224,"Spring break in Gatlinburg was a great time. We arrived Saturday April 19th and checked into our cabin. We had a great time eating, drinking, and of course hiking. When we first arrived the the temperature was a little chilly at lower elevations and freezing at higher up in the mountains. My girlfriend and I drove to Newfound Gap before the snow really started to fall. We made it there just in time. The scenery was awesome while hiking the A.T. The last time we hiked from Newfound Gap we went northbound past Icewater Spring Shelter to Charlie's Bunion. So this time we hiked southbound from the parking lot towards Indian Gap. Everything was bright white from the frost. It was very cool looking to see the frost built up on everything. While hiking we didn't come across any thru-hikers, but when we were at the parking lot we saw quite a few hitching rides into Gatlinburg. The weather was supposed to be getting really bad that night at high elevations. I was happy to see that the hikers had no problem getting rides. There were plenty of people in the parking lot that were actually there for the purpose of giving hikers rides into town. My girlfriend and I gave a hiker named Adam a ride. He said he hasn't done anything funny or dumb enough to get a trail name yet. He also said the hiking has been awesome. He was planning on staying in a hotel called the Grand Prix. It turns out that the Grand Prix is a popular place for hikers to stay. We saw a lot of thru hikers in Gatlinburg. The roads back to Newfound gap were closed for about a day and a half or 2. So several hikers were forced to take a zero day or 2.        On the way out of town my girlfriend and I stopped at the NOC in Bryson City, NC. That place was sweet! We ate lunch and had beers at that restaurant that I've read so much about in several A.T. books. We had a view right over the river and watched some kayakers. There were also a ton of thru-hikers there. There is a nice outfitters store there too for resupplying and whatnot. T      This trip made me more excited to get my hike started. I kept wishing that I was one of the thru-hikers that I saw. Everything that I heard from the hikers we talked to was that it is an awesome experience so far. That is good to hear, but I realize that they are only about 200 or so miles into their hike. They are naturally still feeling their honeymoon stage of the hike. They still have about 2000 more miles to go. I hope they can keep the positive thoughts going all the way to Katahdin.",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Sun",0
