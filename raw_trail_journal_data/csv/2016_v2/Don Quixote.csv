Don Quixote,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524252,"Ordered some lightweight gear from Z packs - arc blast, tent, sleeping bag and getting twitchy as it hasn't arrived yet. Know it is in England but stuck with customs and the post office. Hopefully it isn't going to take too long and cost nme too much more to get hold of it.","
