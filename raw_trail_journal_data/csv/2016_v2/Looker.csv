Went thru my pack and found some non-essential items and shaved a few lbs off. My food still seems heavy but I'm sticking with what I have for now. Hiker Hostel called me to confirm my trip and went over some details, it's well worth the money not to have to worry about getting to Springer. Had a major panic when I couldn't find my trail guide but it was located. WHEW! I'm going baby crib shopping with my son and daughter in law this afternoon and plan on stopping by REI. I want a sawyer bag water filtration deal, I ditched the chemicals I had, I'll carry a life straw and the sawyer. I'm feeling anxious, a little nervous, but I read somewhere to pack all you need but leave your fears at home and I will. I don't know how I will do but I promise to do my best, my goal is to complete the Thru Hike by the October 15th deadline.I know it's going to be cold and rainy, then hot and rainy then cold and rainy again.

Met some cool hikers from New Mexico, The Netherlands, Philly, and Connecticut (thank God for spell check). Woody from the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega picked us up at the train station, stopped at Wally World, I picked up some gloves, Woody said a cold front was coming in and may get into the teens. I'm sacking my stove and going with an alcohol model they sale at the hostel, looks like a better option, I may still grab a jet boil the first chance I get. Woody said breakfast is at 0730 and we should pull out by 0830, I'm starting at Springer as opposed to Amicola Falls, and the drive there is about an hour, so it looks like I will take my first steps tomorrow around 0930.

The white blaze by my feet is the first of thousands to come.it was exhilarating to get to the top and then come back down and head out on the trail. I learned real quick backpacking in the Georgia mountains is not for sissies. It is much harder than I expected. My goal for today was to make it to Hawk Mountain but I came up a little short, I couldn't go any further and I was out of water, I made it to the campsite and got plenty of water, I was so exhausted I could hardly tie a knot, I tried to use my sleeping bag liner but I couldn't get it to work.

Once again my expectations were out of whack. I climbed Sassafras Mountain for what seemed like 8 or 6 hours. This mountain never ended. Up, up. Up without switchbacks. I ran out of water and was sitting on a rock by the trail contemplating Wether I should kill an animal and drink it's blood when a man with a camera walk by, I ask him how far to the next water hole and he said 4 or 5 miles. There's was no way I could make it that far with no water. He did say not far up the trail was a rock outcropping with water dripping from the mountain. Sure enough I found I leaf that had a good stream, good enough to fill two liters in not to long. I hiked further until I thought I was at the top. I saw a fire pit and a flat area so I gave up the fight this day. I set up my camp and crashed. It's was cold that night, and I don't mean Florida cold where when it hits 50 the mayor calls FEMA. It was freezing cold and the wind was unbelievable. I survived all by myself, on top of a mountain. Way cool.","Hawk Mountain Campsite

After finally getting to the top of Sassafras I then had to come down. Coming down sounds easy buts it's not. With the added weight of the pack my footing is shaky. Thus will improve with time but right now I take it slow. When I got to the bottom there was a beautiful creek. I stopped and got two liters and walked up the trail. There was a campsite 100 yards (Justus Creek). I was exhausted so I set up camp. Some guys I knew from the hostel came in with some others and we had a good time talking around the fire.

Started out easy but not for long, in GA it's one mountain after the other and the trail seems to got straight to the top. Not many switchbacks, just straight up. It was hard humping but I had a dream, a dream of a chicken fried steak dinner with mashed potatoes and gravy, this dream pushed me hard to get to woody gap where I could get a ride into Suches, which is pronounced Such As. Well it was at least 3 mountains but I made some time on the first 3 ,but then it got hard, one steep climb followed by a steep descent, at least 3 of these. I finally got to the final down side and could see a parking lot. I was soon to be kicking back with a hot meal. I tried to hitchhike into town but no luck. Then the lady from the hostel drove up and broke my heart. They had a bed but in the whole town not one single place to get a meal, she said she could make me a hotdog, it was terrible, but I have a place to sleep.

So I stayed at the hostel another night. I can rest my bones and eat more hotdogs, but also do 5 miles tomorrow and do Blood Mountain Wednesday which is forcasted to be beautiful day.

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527751,"After an extra days rest and fueled by at least 6 hotdogs I felt like I was 25 again. My goal was to hike to Lance Creek about 3.4 miles. The hiking felt easy and fun for the first time. I arrived at Lance creek around noon and met up with a young couple from Texas I had been sharing a bunkhouse with earlier. She is from Longview near my neck of the woods and he is from Corpus. They now live in San Angelo so we have a lot in common. They were staying there but I felt too good to stop so I made the decision to push thru to Neal Gap. My legs felt great, the sun was shining, the sky was blue, and I was headed to Blood Mountain. At Slaughter Creek I drank a liter of water and topped of two liters for the remainder of my day and started up the Mountain. Something about the trail layout made it seem easier (still hard) but easier than Sassafras and I made it to the top by 5.00 PM. I met a young couple at the top traveling with two dogs who made it there in two days, took me 5 but I know better than to compare. The vieviews were awesome, breathtaking, glorious. I rested awhile, signed the book and head down at 530. Getting down that mountain was hard, sometimes very steep, going over and around huge boulders, a few times level, but not often. My little piggy that went to market was screaming in pain as it was pushed up against the toe if my boot. Thank god I have trekking poles, truly life savers on such a descent. It started getting dark so I stopped to put on my head lamp and as usual it was at the bottom of my pack. Back on the trail I made the rest of the hike with no problems. It was 830 when I crossed the road to the hiker hostel. They were closed and I called every number in the guide book but couldn't reach a soul. I met up with a father/son from Wichita Kansas I had met in Wolf Pen and the dad offered me some chicken and corn tortillas and I jumped on the offer. They were camping out behind the hostel. I was too exhausted to tie my boots much less set up my tent so, and don't tell anyone, I slept in the laundry room. Didn't get much sleep but I thanked God for getting me here safely. This was my longest hike to date, 11.9 miles in 10 hours. It was hard but so much fun. Later.","Woody Gap

I couldn't get a bed until 1030 so I decided to get a ride into town. A hiker named Seth who has crossed my path several times had called one of the shuttle services and the women who came, Suzanne, took me to Blairsville to a great home style restaurant. (13 mile trip $6.00). I had a great breakfast, walked to a nearby store, then to CVS. I called another shuttle and he was there in minutes. He took me back for $10.00. I lounged around most of the day. I forgot to mention that Suzanne gave me a sausage biscuit sandwich and two tangerines, which I was going to eat later. Around 4 or 5 a group of men and women led by Pastor Bill came by and brought barbecue, cantelope, and the best salad I ever ate. One man gave and amazing testimony and I had a chance to talk with both him and Pastor Bill. Their message was meaningful and their gift to us (trail magic) was greatly appreciated. I saved a BBQ sandwich for tomorrow and was given a small jar of homemade jelly for the trail.(to go along with Suzanne gifts) God is good, all the time.","Neal Gap

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528085,"PSA: A reader (lazerlegs) wrote in inquiring as to how effective my preparation was/is. This is important to know for those that are considering hiking the AT. The answer, in a word, ""inadequate"". Train folks, this is hard. As for today, I hit the trail at 0645. As I sit here tonight I cant remember to much about the trail but we were treated to trail magic at tenastee Gap, very welcome, they had water, soda pops, and snacks. The bad part is the steep mountain you have to climb after the Gap. One man at the Gap Said once over the steep mountain the trail would flatten out, it never did. These nice folks up here just don't know what flat is. They need to visit the Florida Panhandle or West Texas. Then they'll know what flat is. All my friends I've been hiking with passed me up throughout the day but I stumbled down the last mountain around 6 pm. I didn't stay at the shelter but set up my tent near my friends. A new hiker joined the group and she was traveling with a big German Shepherd. I fed him 2 packs of tuna and gave away as much food as I could. My food bag prolly weighed 10 lbs. I prolly hiked 11.5 miles carrying 50 lbs. I've got to get my pack weight down, this will help. We all turned in early and it got cold and extremely windy.

But I did, took me about an hour to tear down my camp and pack everything, filled up my water bottles and hit the trail. There was some easy hiking along the trail today. Several stretches where I could hit my 3 mph pace. But once again, the numerous mountains slowed me down. For whatever reason, I struggle going up and down. The final down was really hard. It was about a 2000 foot descent over 1.5 miles. That's steep. Going down is hard on the knees. But at the Gap, there was a man and wife, whose kids hiked the AT last year. They were grillin hot dogs, sausage, and bacon. But more importantly, they had an ice chest full of ice cold gatorade. I got a ride into Hiawasee from one of the nice folks there and on my second try at a motel I ran into my friend ""Living Proof"". He is getting some R and R at the same motel. His feet are bothering him really bad. He is a great guy, a brain cancer survivor, and also a survivor of a bad fall last year while hiking the AT. He's been helping me throughout my adventure with spot on advice and thank God I keep running into him , once he's heeled up I'll never see him because he can fly, did 17 miles the first day. He took me to an all you can eat place and we pigged out on fried shrimp and fish. It was wonderful. Finally got some veggies too. I've done 20 plus Miles in the last two days and I'm feeling it.

I was planning on staying there but there was an accident on the road so the people who were giving me a ride turned around and I stayed in town. Since I still needed to get this stuff to the owner and my knee and ankle were sore I stayed another day in Hiawassee. I met up with the hiker and gave her her stuff, turns out she is hiking the AT as the final leg of the Triple Crown, she has already hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental divide trail. She had passed me the other day not sweating are even breathing hard. She was thankful someone found her stuff and I'm glad it worked out. I chilled the rest of the day and ate again at the all you can eat place. I stayed both days at a motel called Mulls.

Frank had bluegrass music playing on the radio and he and I hit it off real quick. He's retired and does some day hiking with his son. He told me of his exploits on the trail and we commiserated about Hawk and Blood Mountain. This was out of his way but he didn't mind at all. He dropped me off at Unicoi Gap around 11 AM and I started up. The beginning is almost straight up hill like the rest of these Mountains in Georgia but I struggled thru it and getting up Tray Mountain was no picnic either.

Totally alone for most of the morning, but it wasnt long before folks started passing me. I struggled again on the ups and took my time on the downs trying to give my right knee a break. I feel like I'm getting stronger, my wind is improving and my legs are building some endurance but I have a ways to go to claim ""trail legs"". I sat down beside the trail and drank some water and ate ""second breakfast"" and met a retired Navy guy who was on day three. That's right folks he was doing 20 miles per day. Must have been a Navy Seal or something like that. He was flying. Not too long after that I heard a familiar voice and it was ""Living Proof"" he had got back on the trail at Unicoi and had already caught up with me. He was headed to Deep Gap Shelter and so was I. Less than two miles out from the shelter you come up against Kelly Knob, its straight up and seemed to never end. This was a hard climb but I finally made it and headed down and made it to Deep Gap Shelter. Living Proof already had his tent up and had taken a nap. No one else had arrived. I decided to stay in the shelter, my first time. All other times I camped in my tent. The water source was a spring coming straight out of the mountain, I drank from the bottle forgoing my filter. It was cold and good hopefully I didn't catch any bugs. Several other hikers trickled in but no more than 6 or 7.. I cooked one of my dehydrated meals (3 bean chili) and it was great. Living Proof built a fire and we got to know the other hikers. Had a good time talking around the fire and turned in around 8 pm. This was the worst sleep I've had so far.

The Hike was easy compared to the recent past but long down hill hikes really keeps the pressure on my knee. When I got to the bottom trail magic awaited us.

Coincidentally, she has two daughters who served in the Air Force, one that is currently in the Texas Air Guard, the same unit as my son. Cool. Within minutes, and way to early a van from the Hostel showed up and I had to say goodbye to all those good people and good treats. This hostel is amazing, for 30.00 bucks you get a bed in a bunkroom, they give you scrubs to wear while you wash your clothes and free shuttle into town. Sweet deal!.

I felt great for the first 3.5 miles then started slowing down but I was determined to make camp for the first time in North Carolina this night.

At one point, after a long steep climb, I sat on a log and rested, disgusted with myself for not showing any signs of improvement. I said a prayer, drank some water, and pouted. Then some amazing Trail Magic occurred. I believe God sends people to you just when you need them and not a minute sooner. As I sat there feeling sorry for myself a hiker walked up, we exchanged trailnames, his name is ""Square Peg"". I mentioned my disgust and he asked if he could join me on the log. He sat down and told me he had thru hiked the AT last year and that the hike out of Bly Gap was one of the hardest. He told me not to stress that I was doing great and should just try to get to the next shelter. He told me not to worry about making long miles until after I get to the NOC, until then just hike from one shelter to the next. Then he disappeared down the trail and I followed. Encouraged and full of hope. The remainder of the hike that day was hard but I stumbled into Muskrat Shelter, there was Square Peg and several other hikers I knew from Bly Gap. 2.8 miles sounds so little but it was all I and others could do this day. Square Peg is a volunteer trail maintenance guy, he is thru hiking the AT while cleaning all the firepits along the way. He carries a small shovel to do so.

This was my ballywick. I love the rain and as a kid loved to play in the rain. It was cool at first, it rained hard, no thunder or lightning. There was alot of fog. But the trail was a mess, slippery, I fell once. As I got to a gap not sure where to go, a young couple from Maryland (Dregs and Melanie)I had met at the shelter walked up. We found the white blaze and I followed them. As usual it wasn't long before I lost sight of them. The thing about rain suits, they make you sweat alot. I was as wet underneath as I would have been had I not worn a rain suit at all. I reached the next shelter around 11 or so and found Dregs and Melanie and a couple of other hikers huddled in the shelter. I laid claim to a spot against the wall and undressed, my clothes were soaked and it started to get cold. I put on some dry clothes and hung my wet ones on a bench under the overhang, I got in my sleeping bag to warm up and I dozed off. When I awoke dregs and Melanie had decided to stay and soon thereafter Square Peg walked up, accompanied by Big Foot. Big Foot hiked the entire GA AT barefooted, he's from San Marcos Texas and sings in a funk band. Both decided to stay as the rain storm continued. It rain all day and into the night. The shelter filled up, but wet hikers continued to show up. We all had fun listening to tails from the trail from Square Peg and others. Someone mentioned a couple who was hiking the AT with a dog and a cat. They said they would hike as far as the cat wanted but when the cat stopped that's where the couple camped. I heard later the cat is missing. FYI, there are alot of Doobie Brothers, and sisters out here on the trail, which doesn't bother me at all.

It was almost 3 miles to the top and the last half mile was very steep. In several instances rock climbing skills were necessary of which I had none. I improvised and made my way to the top. It was worth the trouble. A magnificent view awaited me and I took a few minutes to soak it in. I hit the top at 930. I came down the mountain and hiked up over a smaller one and made it to Rock Gap by 1230. There is a parking lot at the gap for day hikers and I asked a man if he could give me a lift into Franklin. He said he could take me to Winding Stair Gap and I could hitch hike into Franklin. He and another man who was 75 were going to hike from Winding Stair back to Rock Gap. One offered me a Gatorade and both offered hiking tips. I accepted it all. Once at Winding Gap I stood by the road no more than 3 minutes when a car pulled over. It was a nice young man who said he saw my Air Force insignia on my shirt. Turns out he was active duty Air Force for 8 years and was now going to school near Franklin. We talked about the Air Force and the VA and he said his ultimate goal was to become a clinical social worker and work for the VA helping vets with PTSD and substance abuse issues.

The owner took me to Chinese Buffet which was wonderful, then by the grocery store. This was a great day of hiking and great day of fellowship meeting cool folks.","Betty Creek Campsite

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530512,"I took a zero day today in beautiful Franklin NC. This little town reminds me of my hometown of Nacogdoches Texas. I walked from the hostel down a big hill to main street, went into a coffee shop and enjoyed a great cup of coffee then walked next door to a bakery and had one of the best omelets I've ever had. I sat on a bench and watched people and just enjoyed being alive. I walked up and down the streets looking into the shops. Just on main street there was an Outfitter, an art studio that offered ceramic classes, a couple of restaurants, a cafe, and a coffee shop. I walked back to the hostel and called the city transportation system and a small bus arrived in minutes and took me to Walmart for resupply (3 bucks). After shopping I called again and another bus picked me up, let me stop at a convenience store, stopped at the outfitter while I picked up some fuel for my stove, then dropped me off back at the hostel (2 bucks). The driver was a hiker, in fact her and her husband help maintain several trails in the Smokies. She said I had some challenges coming up up soon and throughout the NC AT and she explained. Finally someone leveling with me. I can't tell you how many times I've been told "" oh its not too bad"" only to find out otherwise. Back at the hostel I met all the new arrivals. There was Ranger, who snored like a bear, a couple of young guys, marines, who were coming off the trail. Sounded like these two just weren't prepared for the rigors and didn't have the right gear. Later in the afternoon a shuttle brought an older man from Brazil, he too was getting off the trail. I had camped with him several days back on Standing Indian Mountain, the day it stormed. He had pitched his tent in a low area, I heard later he awoke with a small pond inside his tent. He spoke very little English, a little Spanish, and a lot of Portuguese. Ranger's grandparents were from Argentina and he spoke fluent Spanish, so he translated. The old man just wanted to go home. It was hard to convey to him that he had done what many others could not, he made it to NC, and that's pretty good. My plan was to crash early while all the younger folks were doing their thing by the firepit. Around midnight I was woke up by the loudest snoring I've ever encountered, and I've slept in open bay barracks in the Air Force. I got up and caught the owner, ""Zin"" and mentioned my problem and he made room for me in the basement. He apologized and said he should have known better, the snoring guys trail name was ""Snorasaurus"". I got my sleep and was so thankful for a great zero day.","Rock Gap

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530516,"I caught the first shuttle bus back to Rock Gap at 0900. The driver was a nice older man from Maine. I told him I was headed there and he told me where to find lobster, just about anywhere. Turns out he was retired military having served in the Navy, then Air Force. He said he was in the process of selling everything he owns, buying a travel trailer and traveling cross country. He said he had a 5 bedroom home fully furnished, in the mountains, he would sell me for 150 thousand. I want that house! Sadly I'm a little busy right now. He had a few stops and the drive back to Rock Gap was 10 or so miles. I really enjoyed listening to this happy man with a plan, I pray his dreams come true. Once at the Gap I stretched a little and hit the trail. The first 3.8 miles flew by, mostly because it was downhill but I was also rested. The next 5 was a little harder. Somewhere up the mountain a guy passed me, low and behold it was ""Snorasaurus"". We spoke briefly and he said he was headed to Silar Bald Shelter. I said I was too while I said to myself, ""no I aint"" . The bad thing is he is a really nice guy, he just snores so loud the walls shake and there is no way I'd sleep, or try to sleep in the same shelter as him. About 3 or so I reached the summit of Silar Bald and it was like nothing I've seen so far. It was a huge meadow. I heard later I missed some spectacular views but with ""Snorasaurus"" in mind I kept going, after all it was only a little over a mile downhill to a picnic area I hoped to camp. About 8 tenths of a mile down I came across a nice spring running out of the mountain so I drank a liter and filled up my bottles. Throughout my Georgia hike, I filtered all the water I drank. Now, if I see water coming straight out of the mountain I don't bother. It's so cold and tastes so good. Of course if it's a stream or a creek I'll filter. As I continued down I begin to hear traffic and see a road but no picnic area. I had caught a glimpse of a green open area but not sure I kept going until I ran out of trail and into a road. I had to backtrack a couple of hundred yards and went back to the green open space and found 3 concrete picnic tables isolated from the world. What a cool place to camp. I immediately set up my stove and cooked some supper. I dressed up some Ramon Noodles with olive oil and Sirachi Garlic and almost licked the pot. I found a nice place to pitch my tent and got everything ready for the night. Around 7 I heard vehicles park and people's voices and thought the worse. Perhaps I'm in someone's private getaway. A few minutes later a group of 5 or 6 people came up the clearing and my guess is they were military, the 4 or 5 men wore high and tight haircuts and they were accompanied by one women. We exchanged hellos and one man said they were about to do some ""power running"" and they took off running up the AT trail I had recently hiked down. They were back just before dark but I was already in my tent and about asleep. I thought about the day, the old man from Maine, the hike, 9.6 miles, my cool camping spot, my full belly and I was thankful.","Rock Gap

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530522,"I crawled out of my tent around 630 and broke camp. I'm getting faster at taking down my tent and repacking my backpack. I prolly hit the trail by 7. Today's hike was very challenging, starting with almost 2 miles of ups, leading to the steep summit of Wayah Bald, elevation 5342, the highest peak encountered so far. Getting to the top though is always so satisfying. I feel like a beat the mountain, I made it, I'm here, then the mountain gives me my reward, breathtaking vistas, and Wayah Bald gave and gave. On top was a large stone tower and once again I didn't have any thoughts of climbing up the steps. I did take a few pictures, rested awhile and then back to the trail. Along the way, on one of my rest stops, ""honey badger"" stopped by. I had met him back at Standing Indian Shelter. He's a young guy from PA who recently sold his landscaping company to ""live the dream"", his words. I told him about ""snorasaurus"" and he offered me a seraquil. I laughed and said thanks but no thanks. He said he was headed to Cold Spring Shelter as I was. He headed out and I soon followed. The rest of the days hike was uneventful, one more short down followed by a mile or so up. When I got to the shelter ""honey badger"" was already there along with ""bare burrito"" a young French Canadian girl I had met earlier with ""honey badger"". I once heard her tell someone traveling with a dog that all animals like her because she was a vegan. I wonder if that""s true. The good thing is, they saved me a place in the shelter. How cool. A string of hikers continued to walk in and it seemed ""honey badger knew them all. I met ""gem"" a woman in her early 40s from Maine. Besides a really cool hammick sleeping system, she had made her stove herself and as just about everything about her, it was pink. ""Honey badger"" built a fire which I had to maintain while he and others held a safety meeting, a long one. For supper I tried something new I had learned from ""living proof"". While in Franklin I bought some couscous and made 4 portions in steamer bags. My plan was to boil water and pour it directly into the bag. I worried that the bags would melt. It worked wonderfully. I waited about 10 minutes and gave it a taste. I dressed it up once again with olive oil and Sirachi Garlic and it was awesome. The young folks returned from the extended safety meeting looking for food. ""Bare Burrito"" said ""I'm gonna get my food bag"", which she had earlier hung up in a tree. My rule is, once I've hung my food bag, it ain't coming down until morning. That's the advantage of not attending safety meetings. Honey badger kept his food in a bear cannister which doesn't require hanging. He dug out some snacks and offered me some cheese and I accepted, not out of hunger but just to be polite. On the trail if someone offers you something you accept. About that time we looked down the hill and ""bare burrito was climbing the tree where her bag was hung. We laughed as we watched her untangle her rope to get her food bag. Not long after she walked up with some jelly beans and snickers bars. The fire was warm and others began coming around and I laughed so hard as each had a million dollar invention idea for the trail. One guy said he would make trekking poles that were also golf clubs so he could hit golf balls off the tops of each mountain, I laughed as much as the others even though I didn't attend the safety meeting, it was fun. I didn't get much sleep that night, turns out ""honey badger"" snores too. Everyone thought it was going to rain that night, except me, I was right. All in all I had another great day on the trail, lots of challenges, a few victories, and a lot of fellowship. I thanked God and tried to sleep.","Wayah Crest Picnic Area

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530546,"Got up and packed and on the trail by 730. It was cool and foggy. Once again everyone thought it was going to rain except me, it didnt. The fog hid the mountains and I'm sure I missed some great views but I hiked fast this morning. I felt stronger and walked several miles of ups and downs without even a pause. I didn't sit down and rest until I reached Tellico Gap, 3.6 miles from the shelter. After a brief rest I had a 1.4 mile, steep climb to the top of Wesser Bald. It was difficult, I rested frequently, but made it to the top and was treated to spectacular views as the fog had lifted. I rested awhile, it was only 11 and I felt great so I decided to go for it and hike the 7 more miles down to the NOC. 7 miles down sounds easy but a lot of the trail was steep, rocky, and somewhat sketchy. I didn't see a lot if folks on the trail. I was passed up by an older gentleman who stopped and asked how I was and if I had enough water. I caught him later when he stopped to take a picture. This particular spot was very dangerous looking because you had to climb down over some rocks to get back on the trail. This guy did so, much better than me. Going down a steep trail is hard on the knees and this was 7 miles. There were some ups, and for once I was glad to see them. It gave my knees a much needed break. My eagerness to get to the NOC today was due in part to the possibility of getting some real food but also because I planned on making some gear changes at the outfitter. I pushed myself hard and eventually started to see civilization, first a telephone pole, then a road, then a building. I could hear a river. I was there. The trail actually comes out across the street from the NOC General Store. I had made reservations for a bunk for tonight, and a cabin for tomorrow. The problem with this hostel is its very inconvenient. The actual building was half a mile or so from the general store, little did I know the bunk rooms were even further up a big hill. I was exhausted from the 11.8 miles I had already hiked so I bought a big bottle of Gatorade and sat on a bench outside the store. A local came out and I asked him which way he was headed. I told him my situation and he agreed to take me to the lodging office. He drove a small ford pick up and he had a one eyed Boston terrier in the cab. On the way he told me that the ""ramps"" were blooming along the trail and I should pick some. I asked what's a ramp? He told me they were wild plants that tasted like onions and garlic. Two of my most favorite things by the way. He dropped me off I checked in only to find out I had to hike up and over a big hill to get to the bunkhouse. I struggled up the hill, got all my dirty clothes and headed back down to get something to eat and wash my clothes. I ran into ""Woodstock"" and ""polar bear"" and he told me the outfitters would sell me a small bag of detergent for 50 cents. On the way I ran into Rick and Marylou, a couple about my age or older I have camped with in the past. They are amazing. On the trail they always pass me up but we seem to end up in the same place. They are strict vegans so there food resupply is a little more difficult than the rest of us. Rick told me once, ""humans are the only species that continue to drink milk after infancy"" and ""from amother animal"". I didn't tell him I love a glass of ice cold milk. They gave me the low down on the food situation. Rick had a pocket full of quarters so I exchanged bills for 3 dollars worth. They said they were getting back on the trail tomorrow and I told them I was taking a zero. After getting my soap from the outfitters I went to the barbecue place next door. I ordered something called a boat. When it arrived I had no idea what it was. It turned out to be pulled pork topped with a spicy Cole slaw. It was fantastic. I tried the Carolina Gold sauce and it was wonderful as well. After eating I washed my clothes and headed back to the bunkhouse. There weren't any chairs so I sat down on the floor next to a wall outlet charging my phone. I was soon joined by a guy drinking a beer who was a SOBO, a south bound who started in Maine and will finish up in Georgia. I picked his brain and he told me stories of what lies ahead. Sounds like New Hampshire is going to be a real challenge. Soon two other men joined in. They were section hikers from Maryland. A man walked by and looked at me and said, didn't I see you on Tray Mountain, he reminded me he was hiking with his dog at the time and I remembered I camped right next to him that night. He was also a section hiker and we talked about the trail. He was very encouraging. One of the things I've come to enjoy about the trail is the instant comradery among hikers. Everyone tries to help each other, no one judges, mutual acceptance and respect. Age means nothing, appearance means nothing. Sex means nothing. It's really cool. Once again I had trouble falling asleep. I got up at midnight and went to the kitchen and made me some Ramon noodles. I finally went to bed for good and thanked God for another great day.","Cold Spring Shelter

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531092,"Left the bunkhouse around 830 and hiked over to the outfitter at the NOC. I needed to replace my old heavy clod hopping boots with something lighter. I have asked many hikers along the way for advice and the majority recommended Salomon hiker shoes. I found a pair and tried them on and I could see myself running up these mountains. I bought them and also picked up a lightweight sleeping pad. I also bought a rain pancho. The NOC offers mail service so I sent my boots and everything in my pack I haven't used home, like my camera, most of my first aide kit, and some extra knives. I also sent my rain suit, I might want that back but I hope the pancho works better for now. The total weight was 8 pounds. I think that will make a difference. After taking care of this business I called the cabin company and arranged a shuttle. On the way to the cabin the driver let me stop at a general store to pick up some food. When checking out the cashier said my card would not process. This was more than annoying so I called my bank and was told a security hold had been placed on my card because of activity outside my normal range of operations. Turns out I should have notified the bank I was traveling. Finally getting this situation behind me we headed to the cabin. It turn out to be a small cottage with 2 rooms, a kitchen, and 4 twin beds. I loved it. I ate and napped and ate some more and slept pretty good for a change. I needed to rest up for what I would face leaving the NOC.

I continue to struggle with the steep sections but when I do I just rest. Halfway up the mountain I met two sisters, ""Hawaii"" and ""Florida Keys"". This is their first experience with long distance backpacking but they are very knowledgeable. I mentioned my pack was causing me extreme pain in my left shoulder and they showed me some adjustments I could make with my straps that might help. It really did make a difference. We passed each other back and forth throughout the day and I got to the shelter around 5 or so. I met a few hikers and soon ""Hawaii"" and ""Florida Keys"" walked up. This was a double decker shelter and I was first to claim a spot on the top level. A young guy and his girlfriend set up next to me and soon all spots were filled. It rained for about an hour and by ""hiker midnight"" (when the sun goes down) everyone except me was asleep. I'm still having problems falling asleep.

Coming down to Stecoah Gap we were treated to some apples and bananas that were left as trail magic by some nice day hikers. It was nice to eat some fruit for a change. About a mile later I came to ""Jacobs Ladder"" Square Peg"" had warned us of this monster. It is only 6 tenths of a mile long but almost verticle. In some places I could take no more than 5 or 4 steps without a pause. There was no place to sit down it was too steep. That was the longest 6 tenths of a mile I believe I've ever hiked. It really kicked my butt. I was so happy to get to the top and not far passed that point I came to the shelter. Many of the younger folks kept going but I was spent. At the shelter I met Ron and David, two fireman from West Palm Beach Florida who were section hiking from Fontana Dam. They built a big fire and more hikers arrived and the shelter filled to capacity. Just before dark a storm rolled in and I was very thankful I chose to stop here.

Several hikers from the shelter came by as well as a big group of SOBO southbound hikers who mistook me for trail magic. They were disappointed to find I had nothing to offer them.

The driver took me to the Grill and I had a big double cheeseburger and fries. Suddenly I decided staying at the lodge might not be such a bad idea. It was a little expensive but I didn't feel like hiking anymore. I'm glad I did. I soaked in a hot bath tub, ate a great salad at the restaurant and got some great rest.

I talked to Snorasaurus and found out he lives in Austin Texas. He's a beer genius and works at a place called Bangers and educates staff and customers on everything you need to know about beer. He's a great guy who just happens to snore like a bear. Curry Toe got her trail name because she successfully treated foot blisters with tumeric. I somehow missed adding Tumeric to my first aid kit. I washed my clothes and did my shopping, ate a hot dog and had a great time talking with the others. I called a shuttle and got a ride back to the marina where I had gotten off the trail. It was a short walk 1.2 miles to the shelter. I got there and couldn't believe how nice this shelter is. It's called the Hilton for good reason. It has a cell phone charging station and it's located on the lake. A short walk up a hill is a real bathroom with showers. Because I knew all the snorers staying at the shelter, I pitched my tent nearby. I met a family, two brothers about my age and one daughter, who were hiking south from Buena Virginia to Springer. As has always been the case they accepted me into their world and we had a great afternoon talking about the trail. I learned a lot of what lay ahead and also received a lot of encouragement.

The Fontana Dam area is so beautiful it was hard to leave. About 1.5 miles in you enter the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. All thru hikers are required to obtain a perMIT which gives you 8 days to hike thru the park. In addition, thru hikers must stay in shelters and if full must tent in the shelter tenting area. If a section hiker with a reservation arrives to a full shelter, a thru hiker must give up his or her spot. The hike thru the park is about 67 miles. With this in mind I planned on hiking to Mollies Ridge Shelter 11.4 miles from Fontana. The first 7 miles is a steady climb up. At the 5 mile point I stopped for a break near Birch Spring Campsite. Suddenly the temperature dropped drastically. I had on a tee shirt and shorts and it was freezing. I threw on my Pancho as cover and started putting on my long johns. Naked as a Jay bird under my Pancho I had one foot in when a female hiker walked up from the campsite. I apologized and she grinned and walked on. I put on almost all of my winter wear and moved on. I felt really strong today and made it to Mollies Ridge by 3. I met Ninja there and he said he had heard the next shelter was closed but I didn't want to stop. That meant I would have to hike another 6 miles to the next shelter. I went for it. The next 3 Miles went quick and I arrived at Russell Field Shelter around 430. Sure enough it was closed do to aggressive bear activity. I filled up my water bottles and moved on. The next 3 miles were tough because I'd never hiked this far in a single day and also because it was uphill. It seemed to get colder as the evening progressed. In addition it started to rain. I had sent my rain suit home at the NOC and replaced it with a Pancho. This was a huge mistake. Cold and rain is a terrible combination. I got to the shelter by 7 pm and there was plenty of space. Since I had put on just about all of my layers I only had some dry shorts and socks left in my bag. I decided to take off my wet pants but leave on my somewhat wet long johns. I cooked some Ramon noodles and jumped in my sleeping bag. I have a 30 degree sleeping bag with a liner. The liner is suppose to add 10 degrees potentially providing warmth down to 20 degrees. I call bull on this promise. I was so cold my teeth were chattering and I shivered uncontrollably. It was hard to sleep but I did, a little.

Some of the hikers from the night before had left that morning but 4 or 5 of us discussed taking a zero and making the hike to Cling man's dome the next day. I got up and ate some noodles and helped Ninja fetch wood for the fire. ""3 Times"" put up a tarp to shield the wind and soon we had a comfy somewhat warm shelter. I ran into the young lady( Grasshpper ) who had caught me in my birthday suit the day before. I apologized for flashing her and she laughed and said she had diverted her glance. We all had a laugh and watched as the snow intensified. Around noon, a man walked in and started asking who had stayed at the shelter the previous night. We all fessed up not thinking anything of it. He then pulled off his jacket to reveal his Ranger uniform He said we had to leave because the rules say you can only stay at a shelter one night. He then checked all of our permits. Talking about disappointment, we were crushed. Here we had a roaring fire and a cozy shelter and now we were told we had to hike to the next shelter in the snow. I packed up and hit the trail.

First I filled up my water bottles then pitched my tent. For some reason, maybe my eyesight, the spot I picked was uneven, bumpy, and worse had my head going downhill. But daylight was disappearing so I had to make do with what I had. I have a Eureka Solitaire tent which is great, it's small, and lightweight. However it is too small to sit up in and virtually impossible to change clothes in. I had to get my wet pants off. My fingers were useless as they were dang near froze. I finally got them of and once gain left on my cold wet long Johns and put on some dry shorts and socks. Most checklists suggest only having two pairs of socks but I carry 4. It's a good thing I do. Warm dry feet provide a smidgen of comfort when cold everywhere else. I shivered myself to sleep but woke many times throughout the night. What a day this had been. Many times on the trail today I thought how great it would be to be at my son's home in Austin, watching a baseball game eating Mexican food.

I fell a couple of times, thankfully without injuries. Ive learned that the added weight of the pack makes it virtually impossible to stop a fall once I slip.

We walked on down to the parking lot and waited for the daughters mom to pick us up. She arrived and we headed to Gatlinburg. I had a list of motels in my guide book and I tried to call several times and finally got through. The man said he didn't take reservations but he would find me a room when I got there. We found the Grand Prix Motel fairly easily and I talked to the man. There was a hiker behind me in line i knew from the sniw day, ""tandy"" and we talked and agreed to split a two bedroom costing us 20 bucks each. Pretty good set up, private bedrooms and shared bath for hostel prices. I told the man I would zero the next day and he said no problem. This little section of Gatlinburg has everything a hiker needs. Good food, small grocery store, a NOC outfitter, and plenty of hotels. After returning from getting somethings from the small grocery store I found 8 or 10 hikers I knew sitting outside their rooms talking. I talked to several as I washed my clothes. Some were staying the next day as I was while others were getting back on the trail. I laughed as I watched one hiker after the other limp around or grunt and groan when standing up. I thought to myself if a non hiker was to see all this he or she may think this was a convalescent center or something. We all were beat up from the last few days and everyone had aches and pains. Me and my roommate ""Tandy"" ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut and chilled the rest of the evening. I didn't sleep well again, but I was so thankful to be in a warm climate again, dry, and comfortable, well fed, totally satisfied.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

As we sat outside the motel waiting, a car pulled up across the street and asked if we needed a ride. The man said he would take up to 4 of us to cling man's dome or Newfound Gap for gas money, (10 bucks). Me and 3 others jumped on it. After we bought gas the man told us he was a 425 pound gay man, ""as if you didn't know"" his words, then he proceeded to tell us how his ex got drunk and was eaten by a bear. I don't think I was the only one in the car that started to worry a little when he pulled off to the side of the road. This guy was something else. He told us his entire life story over the course of 15 miles all accompanied by his favorite Stevie Nicks songs he had recently burned to CD. I finally arrived back at Clingman's Dome around 130. The walk back up the steep paved road was a killer, only half a Mile but almost straight up. I didn't feel bad as I watched tourist after tourist sit down on one of the many benches positioned along the road. Once at the top I found the AT where I had left off and started back down. I planned to go about 10 miles but the trail was a slushy mess from the previous snow. By the time I got to the Mt Collins intersection it was almost 4 and I knew I couldn't make it 7 more miles before dark so I made the decision to stay there for the night. Shortly after I arrived I met a young man from Tulleride CO. Who had just completed a 20 mile day. He is a restaurant manager who has drank tequila with Dennis Quaid and had a conversation with Reece Witherspoon. His hiking buddy ""Lando"" from Orlando came in next with a story of how a couple up on Clingman's Dome gave him a 50 dollar bill just for explaining what thru hiking the AT entailed. Talk about trail magic. Later a group of 5 or 6 college guys from Iowa State came in and they were a hoot. One was carrying 10 cans of ravioli, another numerous bottles of alcohol, and another a 6 man tent. They were doing a 3 day loop and yes I believe they were looped alright, but they partied quietly. I hated that my day was short, miles wise, but it had been enjoyable and I can make up the difference tomorrow. The shelter was fairly quiet and comfy and I slept pretty good.","Clingmans Dome

Lots of tourist roaming around and several stopped and asked me what I was doing. ""Walking to Maine?"" That's crazy one said. Others were just amazed as I told them where and when I started. After resting awhile I headed up the steep mountain once again. After a while i heard a voice and was soon join ed by a familiar face, it was the man who brought the beer and Pepsi down at Fontana Hilton. We hiked together the first 3, very steep miles. He thru hiked the AT last year and is section hiking the smokies this year. He is a retired accountant from Wichita KS. He slowed down to my pace and offered up a lot of good advice that I filed away for future use. At the 3 Mile point our trails went in different directions as I continued heading north. I stopped by Ice Water Shelter to eat a snack but feeling strong I pressed on to Pecks Corner, 7.3 miles away. It was a bunch of ups and downs ending with a nice 2 mile down. I reached the shelter around 7. A long day for sure but very satisfying. Met a new group of ""safety meeting"" enthusiasts along with some familiar faces. The shelter was nice enough and the company was great.","Mt. Collins Shelter

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533646,I felt terrible this morning. Didn't get much sleep and I felt exhausted. My first step up felt like I had already hiked a full day. The days hike started with 3 or 4 steep ups and downs and I knew from the start I couldn't go past the next shelter. Once there I ate some instant potatoes and remembered I had not ate dinner the night before or any breakfast today. Im pretty sure my lack of proper nutrition had a lot to do with my poor performance this day. I rested and dried out my gear and ate a second time. Ju Ju and Walk More came in as well as several others I had met in Gatlinburg. I took some benadryl and jumped in the sack just before dark. I made plans to pay closer attention to my nutrition and rest from here on out. I fell asleep thankful for another day on the AT trail,"Pecks Corner

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533649,"Woke up feeling much better than yesterday. I planned on making it in to Standing Bear Hostel which would have been over 17 miles. I only faced 3 big ups but mostly big downs so I was confident I could do the distance. Within 2 miles of Davenport Gap it began to grow dark followed by some light sprinkles. I stopped into the shelter just in time, once again, thank God. The skies opened up and it poured. It was close to 6 so I stayed put. This shelter is unique in the Smokies because it has a chain link fence separating the sleeping area from the outside. We had just heard of the bear attack at Spence Field so this made us feel safe. Everyone ate and turned in early but as has happened many times, a group of 4 section hikers rolled in around dark. It took them awhile to settle in so the shelter wasn't totally quiet until close to 10. I thought about the day and was pleased with my performance. Had the weather held up I was sure I could've made the distance. I felt good, my belly full, comfortable in my sleeping bag, with visions of hostel hamburgers in my near future.","Tri-Corner Knob

It was one of those beautiful mornings even though overcast and raining. Crossed over the same stream 4 or 5 times, once looking up at a beautiful waterfall. As I exited the woods onto a frontage RD I saw a sign saying Knoxville and Ashville. The AT actually runs down the frontage road under the overpass and up a hill. The hostel was half a mile or so off the trail. I fell in love with this place the second I arrived. The most laid back comfortable hostel I've encountered. I ran into Viking and Ninja and was told to knock on the front door and ask for Maria. Maria was gone but her sister told me to find a place and come back and let her know what I had chosen. I picked a semi private cabin (sleeps four) with a big bed. Maria's sister showed me the resupply bldg. You get whatever you want and write it down on an envelope and pay when you leave. I ate numerous sandwiches and hamburgers and had my fill of soda pop and gatorade. The hostel had a kitchen where many hung out. I saw Juju and Walkmore, Currie Toe, and many others I've come to know along the trail. My roommate was a guy about my age who is a retired Army National Guard Colonel who did a tour in Afghanistan. He was completing a section in smokies then heading up north to Massachusetts on his way to Katadyn. We had a great time talking shop about the military and I was amazed at his stories about his experiences in the middle east.He gave me many hiking tips, particularly interesting was his winter hiking suggestions. Most of the young folks were planning to take a shuttle to Damascus VA the next day for Trail Days but I planned on staying put and resting.I turned in around hiker midnight and slept like a baby.

I think I'll go next year and check it out and walk in the parade. It was a beautiful day and I lounged around in the kitchen area listening to Johnny Cash and eating more hamburgers. I cleaned up the kitchen and sorted out the recycling for Maria. She was pleased and surprised but I needed something to do. This was exactly what I needed at the time, rest and relaxation. In the early afternoon a young man came in looking for a bunk and I referred him to Maria. Turns out he was active duty Air Force for 8 years and had recently separated and was going to school on the GI Bill. His trail name was lipstick because he carried 3 lipstick shaped phone chargers. However he changed it to chapstick the next day. We had a good time talking about the Air Force and hiking the AT. He is doing it a section at a time. We hung out all afternoon and evening and the folks from Trail Days finally got back around 11 pm. This was a great zero and I was thankful I had the opportunity.","Standing Bear Hiker Hostel

Looker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535017,"Slow start this morning. Decided to make some oatmeal and drink some coffee before heading out. I could have easily stayed longer. I really enjoyed my stay. After talking with the hiker formerly known as ""lipstick"", now ""chapstick"" I decided to step up my game and try to keep up with him on his way to Erwin. He headed out first and I followed 30 minutes or so later. Coming out of Standing Bear we faced a 4.4 mile up. I felt good and pushed myself hard. About halfway up the mountain I came to a somewhat flat section which surprised me and for once instead of looking down I looked up just in time to see a bear cross the trail about 25 yards in front of me. It never looked my way just kept running, rather swiftly, down the mountainside. I felt stunned, excited, perhaps fearful, but overall it was very cool. A little while later I could see a clearing up the trail and once there, discovered a grassy bald, as I approached the top I could see something that looked like a missile coming out of the ground which I learned later was a FAA installation. Before the top I walked past a sign saying ""Trail Magic"" at the top. My pace quickened as I anticipated or wished for some ice cold gatorade. At the top I saw a man and he was waving me over as I approached he began offering me drinks, another voice asked me if I wanted some homemade ice cream while still another asked if I wanted a PB&J sandwhich. It was almost too much. I grabbed a gatorade and ate a strawberry donut and a banana then looked over more goodies. Chapstick was there as well as several other hikers. They had all kind of first aide stuff and I grabbed a handful of Vitamin I (ibuprofen), some bubble gum, and fireballs. These nice folks do this every week and I couldn't thank them enough. I should have tried the ice cream but I pushed on. The rest of the days hike was a series of ups and downs with only one steep up and down. I made it into the shelter around 6 and found a spot. Chapstick had set up his hammock and we joined Grits, Scuba Steve, Cody and a few others at the cooking table and cooked and ate our dinners. I'm on an instant potatoes kick since breaking up with Ramon Noodles. Add a little olive oil and Sarachi Garlic and it's pretty darn good. Turned in around dark and slept ok. I couldn't keep pace with the young whippersnapper but I made the miles and that felt good.","Standing Bear Hiker Hostel
