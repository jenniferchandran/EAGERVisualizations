Point Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/422639,"                                 "" A Dream ""
SO, I turned 42 years old two days ago. My goal and dream is to begin my thru hike sometime in March 2016. I have a lot of saving and preperation between now and then. I have dreamed of completeing the AT for several years and the passion to do it grows inside of me daily. This is my first official journal entry and I will post often. 
I will be hiking the AT in honor of my wife and her late son, Daniel, who went to be with our Lord in 2010 at the age of 14. My wife and I will be completing the thru hike together either side by side on the trail or she'll meet up at intervals from start to finish. Either way, we will be together. Between now and start time, we will be recruiting pledges of support,not for us but for "" The Daniel Project"", which will be a not for profit organization that will be devoted to helping greiving parents of fallen childen. Our hike will be devoted daily to remembering and honoring Daniel and a different family and child each day. Our goal is to find some steps of peace and healing for her and those that have been cursed in her unforuntate catagory of a greving parent and to provide help with special needs. I will post more exciting details of the Daniel Project soon.
Wife, I love You.
""Point Man"".... My selected trail name, Point Man, is deciated to my life hero, my Dad. He was drafted at 19 yrs of age, served in the 1st Calvary in Vietnam were he was a "" Point man"". The "" Point man"" or walking the point, is the unlucky person that leads the unit by mapping and cutting trail and usally the first to be hit line the line of fire, which my dad was. He survived and has been such a blessing to me. Thank you Dad for your service, I love you. I'm honored to use your title as my trail name.
Keep us in your prayers and thoughts and I'm counting the days until our through hike begins and the Daniel Project is born.... Stay tuned, it'll be a heck of an adventure!

Point Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/422649,"I will be completing numerous hikes on various trails and sections of the AT in preperation and training for my thru hike. I look forward to posting details, photos, and journals. The Daniel project will be the main purpose and point of interest as my quest and dreams come alive. I hope that somehow, God leads greiving parents and families in our direction and maybe they can follow and find unity and peace and some healing through our journey. My wife and I look forward to providing trail magic where the AT crosses in our community near Laurel Fork Falls in Dennis Cove area of Hampton,TN.",,training,"Jun 28, Fri",0

Point Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423702,"Today marks 1000 days left until my projected start date of my thru hike. I find myself constantly daydreaming of living on the trail headed to Maine. I've been asked numerous times, "" why?"". The answer to that question requires and deserves much more than a one or two sentence answer. I'll attempt to put words to the answer in this entry so that I can refer those that don't understand to this journal and save myself a lot of trouble, So here goes..
First of all I have a very strong passion and desire to be in nature. Several years ago I started Kayaking in search of a close connection with nature. Although I did enjoy it and actually started becoming a decent kayaker, it wasn't until I started back country hiking that I realized that I finially found the the ultimate connection for me. I kayaked some class 3 water which included a 16 ft waterfall on the Tellico River, ( baby falls ), and yet none of that compaired to the first real hike I completed. Perhaps the speed of they river made me feel like I was missing all of the beauty passing by me. So, I sold my kayak and started hiking solely, and I haven't regreted it at all. I spend much of my time on the trail in deep thought and use it as my escape from the fast pace and stress of everyday life. I hold a lot inside of me and it's my way and my time to unlock parts of my mind and heart. In a way, it's sort of a spiritual experience for me, not to replace God or anything like that, but a way for me to connect with his creations and his power and walk close to his hand. I can't get that from a church filled with people that are watching for the clock to hit noon so they can rush to the cracker barrel and listen to a preacher that is looking for numbers and dollars. Not saying all is that way, just the few I've been associated with... Anyway, I recently turned 42 and I find myself starving to do something with my life that I can leave to my children and friends and something that will define and sum up who I am, who I've always wanted to be.. The trail does that. The trail allows me to be free, not restricted to a time clock or stuck in a place that steals life from me instead of a place that makes me want to experience life. The trail shows that I depend on me, and my survival depends on me and my preperation. It shows that I'm not affraid to choose my paths and I'm not affraid to take a chance on my dreams. Kids,dont let anyone or anything rob you of your dreams.. Make them happen. The trail has countless rewards, but not without a price. The trail gives you nothing, you earn it. It has no place for the faint of heart, those that lack heart, or the lazy. The trail is the path and the key for life and happiness. It's as deep as you want to make it.. It's as far as you want to take it. The AT is my happy place and I don't want to hike it for the miles or the title, I want to see it, I want to live it,feel it, and be a part of it... 
I want the last half of my life to be worth something to me and allow me to offer something to those that I love.
I'm humble and anxious......

Point Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/429908,"With approx 960 days until I depart for my thru hike, I have began some training and preparation. I had a nice work out yesterday evening with a full pack and it felt great to sweat and walk. Although I looked like a homeless goof as I hiked through town, in my mind I was on the trail. I will continue to work out after work as I can and plan on getting on some trails soon. A friend and I have made plans to climb Mt. Leconte in the Smokies next month on a two day trip that I hope to get at least 15 miles of trail time in. We will NOT be staying in the Mt. Leconte lodge @ over $100 per person, but in a nearby shelter. I'll be posting some pictures of the trip. I have been reading basically everything I can get my hands on that has to do with the AT or hiking in general and grow more anxious by the day to start my journey. More to come soon.
