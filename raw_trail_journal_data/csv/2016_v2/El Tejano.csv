El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522864,"About ten years ago my sons Matthew and Gabriel went to the Naval Academy for a Water Polo camp. If you have not had the opportunity to visit the site it is a must. Lot's of history and it is just stunning. Another parent and I decided to go site seeing and ended up at Harper's Ferry, which also happens to be the halfway point of the AT. I did not know much about the trail, my companion told me a bit about it and recommended a book, ""A Walk In the Woods"", I read it and I was intrigued. Read a couple more books about the trail and it became to number one thing on my list after I retire. Well I am retired, so now you know how I came to this. I am not crazy, just curious!!!!!",,Appalachian Trail,"Mar 06, Sun",0
El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522862,"I've done a lot of research and asked a lot of questions so why do I feel unprepared??? Oh yeah, because I have no experience backpacking and have not trained carrying a loaded pack often enough. Well I guess spending time with my running friends at the least kept me in shape. All my gear is packed and my pack weighs about 40 lbs with food and water, hope to get that down to at least 35 lbs by the time I start Friday morning. Tomorrow I will fly out to Atlanta with Yvonne. We will spend the nite with cousins and then head to the area of the AT trailhead. My cousin David will be driving up to meet us there. David is quite a character to be around. Some of you may know what I mean. Time to go finish packing.",,Appalachian Trail,"Mar 07, Mon",0
El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522865,"Fun facts for my friends & followers of El Tejano's hike...:-)The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest continuously marked footpaths in the world, measuring roughly 2,180 miles in length. The Trail goes through fourteen states along the crests and valleys of the Appalachian mountain range from the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, Georgia, to the Trail’s northern terminus at Katahdin, Maine. Known as the “A.T.,” it has been estimated that 2-3 million people visit the Trail every year and about 1,800–2,000 people attempt to “thru-hike” the Trail. People from across the globe are drawn to the A.T. for a variety of reasons: to reconnect with nature, to escape the stress of city life, to meet new people or deepen old friendships, or to experience a simpler life.The A.T. was completed in 1937 and is a unit of the National Park System. The A.T. is managed under a unique partnership between the public and private sectors that includes, among others, the National Park Service (NPS), the USDA Forest Service (USFS), an array of state agencies, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and 31 local Trail-maintaining clubs.FUN FACTS• The Trail is roughly 2,180 miles long, passing through 14 states.• Thousands of volunteers contribute roughly 220,000 hours to the A.T. every year.• More than 250 three-sided shelters exist along the Trail.• Virginia is home to the most miles of the Trail (about 550), while West Virginia is home to the least (about 4).• Maryland and West Virginia are the easiest states to hike; New Hampshire and Maine are the hardest.• The total elevation gain of hiking the entire A.T. is equivalent to climbing Mt. Everest 16 times.• The A.T. is home to an impressive diversity of plants and animals. Some animals you may see include black bears, moose, porcupines, snakes, woodpeckers, and salamanders. Some plants you may encounter include jack-in-the-pulpit, skunk cabbage, and flame azalea.HIKERS• About 2 to 3 million visitors walk a portion of the A.T. each year.• The A.T. has hundreds of access points and is within a few hours drive of millions of Americans, making it a popular destination for day-hikers.• “Thru-hikers” walk the entire Trail in a continuous journey. “Section-hikers” piece the entire Trail together over years. “Flip-floppers” thru-hike the entire Trail in discontinuous sections to avoid crowds, extremes in weather, or start on easier terrain.• 1 in 4 who attempt a thru-hike successfully completes the journey• Most thru-hikers walk north, starting in Georgia in spring and finishing in Maine in fall, taking an average of 6 months.• Foods high in calories and low in water weight, such as Snickers bars and Ramen Noodles, are popular with backpackers, who can burn up to 6,000 calories a day.• Hikers usually adopt “trail names” while hiking the Trail. They are often descriptive or humorous. Examples are “Eternal Optimist,” “Thunder Chicken,” and “Crumb-snatcher",,Appalachian Trail,"Mar 08, Tue",0

They did a great job of checking out our gear and backpacks to help us get rid of what we didn't need. Talked to some hikers and got some tips. Everyone has been very nice and helpful. We drove to a parking area where David left his truck. Hopefully we can cover the 110 miles and reach the truck safely.",,Appalachian Trail,"Mar 10, Thu",0
El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523253,"We started out with a good breakfast this morning then made our way to the starting point at Springer Mountain. Yvonne navigated the jeep along a 6.5 mile, very bumpy, winding, almost one lane, dirt road to get to our starting spot. We hiked the 1.05 miles BACK to the beginning of the trail where David and I registered. We met 'Bombadil' and 'Boots and Books' at the start. No doubt we will see them again during hike. We hiked back to where we parked, loaded our gear on our bodies and took off, 11:00 a.m.
We took a nice side trail to Long falls and had a snack, break, and face dunk. That was soooo refreshing. Although we were tired we were glad we visited it.  David off loaded some stuff...and didn't load it back on!! I feel like David is that character from ""A Walk in the Woods"". Ha ha!  Got to Hawk Mountain shelter at 4:15 p.m, pitched tents and had red beans and rice, while visiting with some other hikers.","Springer Mountain

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523348,"The night was pretty restful. We walked to Justus Creek where I took a dip. The water was definitely cool but sooo refreshing. We met a couple from Colorado and a lady from Australia. It is interesting the mix of people that are here. We met a man from New Zealand yesterday and when we caught up with him today, he told us he had sprained his ankle 2 hours into the trail.  We used bear cables tonight to prevent the bears from getting to our food. Check out my photos.
Here I am filtering water out of a stream. It is a really slow process but we are not in a hurry. We met this man tonight, Jack Daniels, thanks to a friend. He is really a good guy!!","Hawk Mountain Shelter

It was hard to get all of my gear together and in my backpack while in my tent but I did it. I put my rain gear on then went outside to pack my tent. When we got to woody gap and the rain had stopped, I lay out some of my things so that they could dry off.David, my cousin, was feeling under the weather today and his heavy backpack was not helping things so he decided to end his hike...for now. No doubt we will meet on the trail later.I am at Lance Creek for the night. I pitched my tent and enjoyed the campfire that some of the other campers made. We had a really nice evening sitting around the campfire with Pokey, Nicole, Sperry, Amanda, Kyle, Justin, Simon and Ryan. There were a few others but I did really well remembering all of the names I did! We laughed a lot and enjoyed looking up at the stars. Time for bed soon.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523551,"Last night I had the best night's sleep since I started the trail. I woke up with fewer pains...my body is adapting. I opened my tent up and watched the sunrise. Very pretty. I had a small breakfast and got going around 9 a.m. I climbed Blood Mountain but at 4461 elevation, I was above the clouds. I have heard that the view is awesome from up here but I couldn't see it today.  From here I headed to Neel Gap where I met David, my cousin. He greeted me with a Pizza and a coke...a welcome sight.I spent most of the afternoon with David then got back to the trail and hiked to Bull Gap. I set up my tent and sat around with a lot of familiar faces, Simon, Kyle, Ryan and others. Some students joined us from the University of Tennessee who are hiking the trail for Spring break. A lot of our conversation centered around one particular hiker. Everyone had a story about him. More about him later.","Lance Creek

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523671,"Last night I had another good night. I woke up feeling good and ready for action. I started out at 8:51am....Two and a half miles later I reached Wolf Laurel and I got to see some nice views as the day was pretty clear.There are some wonderful people that come on the trail called Trail Angels. This is what they do (see photo). They come to the trail, 'camp out' and give weary hikers food, snacks, clothing and whatever useful things they think we may appreciate. I ate a lot of snacks!! The dried food I have is really good but there is nothing like the traditional snack! I even got a cap!There is also this thing called Trail Magic. That is when people leave things along the trail. They 'magically' appear like the 2 bottles of Heineken and Cliff bars I came across today. My friends back home...you will be shocked to know that I passed on the beer!I am sure that you all realize that the trail is very mountainous so in a mater of hours I can change my elevation a couple of thousand feet in either direction. I didn't have a big change in elevation today but the climb to Wildcat Mountain was pretty tough.I reached Low Gap Shelter by 2:30 p.m. Pretty good time! I had in mind to go another mile and a half but I am whooped. This is it for me for today.Dinner tonight was Pad Thai. It was very good for dried food.Goodnight.","Bull Gap

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523774,"Another good night. I started out at 8:55 this morning and I am hiking along steadily making good time. I have done 6 miles and it is only 10:30 am. I met a physician this morning who seems to share a lot of the values of Brandon (son). I think they should talk.After the first 5 miles there were a lot of ups and downs. That part was hard going but when I stopped to catch my breath, there were lots of beautiful views. I walked on and off with Junco, Simon and Right Foot. We ended up stopping at the Cheese factory campsite. We had another campfire night with Simon, Justin, Ryan, Right Foot, Rachel from Houston, Nick and brother and sister, Firecracker and Simba. I shared some good red beans and rice with Justin tonight.

Today I walked by myself for the most part. I met up with Simon and Right foot a few times and ended my hike at Deep Gap Shelter. There are lots of people here. One of them, Sarah, is ending her hike as she turned her ankle. That appears to be a common thing here...spraining your ankle... understandably so given the terrain. In order to see the wonderful views you literally have to stop otherwise you may trip. It really forces us to focus on the beauty of nature. 
I have met up with other hikers from Germany, and Quebec. The Appalachian trail is a melting pot!","Cheese Factory Site

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523971,"Today I met Rock Kicker. Yes, he got his name because he kicks rocks! He is part of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, a group that maintains the Appalachian Trail. Rock Kicker walked the trail in 1984 and ever since then he has maintained one mile of the trail. Sometimes he walks more than the one mile. He is about 70 years old (I am guessing) and a very nice and interesting man.I got off the trail today at Dicks Creek Gap and took a pre-arranged shuttle to Hiawassee, GA where I had a motel room waiting for me. (Thanks Yvonne). It was soooo good to be able to take a shower. I have been bathing in the springs daily but the water is really chilly. I ate a BBQ lunch with Nick and Jaime. I had to resupply my meals and I figured that I would send home whatever I haven't used in this first week. I obviously don't need those items. Every ounce helps me have a lighter backpack. I was able to do some laundry also. I walked around town and ran into Junco at the grocery store. I met up with a couple of guys at a beer tasting place (see photo) then went back to the motel and hung out outside with Nick, Jaime and a few others.
I am looking forward to another real shower and a real bed tonight! Even though I say that, I have not been craving a bed or shower. I am very comfortable with what I am doing. I am living my dream out here in the wilderness. It's been great!","Deep Gap Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524109,"Today I crossed into North Carolina. Another milestone! The next one is to reach 100 miles!! North Carolina has not been nice so far. It has been straight uphill for about 4.5 miles with an increase in 1700ft elevation. On top of that, it is cold. 45 degrees cold and it will be colder tonight. I will let you know how I do with that tomorrow.I met a couple of nice kids who are on spring break. They made burritos for lunch. I also met a very nice couple who live in Florida. He is a fellow Aggie...Whoop!!! He also lived in Baytown after he graduated in the early 90's. I also met up with Gwen who had to backtrack a few days ago. There are a few familiar faces and many new ones at Muskrat Creek Shelter. Junco is here too. It is too cold to stay out and socialize much. It was supposed to rain today but it held off. We just had a few sprinkles.","Dicks Creek Gap

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524229,"Feeling cold all day. My hands were numb from the cold this morning. They got Less numb as the day went on but they didn't get warm at all. I hiked a lot of miles today and I was hoping to get warmeer. I feel pain under my foot sometimes but to my surprise, I don't have blisters. 
On another note, my research paid off as my down jacket has served its purpose. It keeps me really warm. I could have walked longer but I didn't want to get caught in the snow. If the down gets wet, it looses its power to keep me warm and I couldn't have that!
Each day I refill my water from the creeks. Most of the creeks only have trickling water so it is hard to find the right spot that has enough water flowing to dip your bottle in. 
I met Graybeard and Peavy yesterday on the shuttle ride from Hiawassee. I hiked with them for a bit today. They too are retired. I spent most of my day hiking with Junco. The most interesting man on the trail today was Wanderer. He 'wandered' up while Junco and I were having lunch and he was playing a banjo as he walked. (See my photos) He sounded really good. I don't know how he did it in the cold though.
After I got my tent set up, it started snowing. I am all wrapped up in my clothes and sleeping bag and I still feel a little cold. Hopefully I will warm up a little and have a good night.
Until tomorrow...","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Although it was bitter cold it was nice walking through the snow on the trail. The sun came out and there were beautiful views. 
I got to the Forest Fire Watchtower on Albert Mountain and had lunch with the hikers. I made the 100 mile mark!! It was quite a climb to get here. There were several hikers here that I have met before and I met Monster and Miles. I started walking again and met up with Conductor and Junco on my way to Winding Stairs Gap.
I decided to walk an extra 3 miles today and try to get into town (Franklin) instead of camping out in the freezing cold and walking the 3 miles tomorrow to get to Franklin. 
I got the shuttle van at Winding Stair Gap and Peavy and Graybeard were already on it. I caught up with Simon at the hotel (who is a day ahead of me). Peavy, Graybeard and I dined together and we had a great meal and good conversation.

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524526,"I had a good warm night last night.    I was a little stiff this morning. I came to find out today that nobody who camped out the night before could stay warm. In fact, one of the hikers saw the snow building up on his tent and thought it might cave in. Well, it did. At that point he got up and made a fire to try to stay warm and waited patiently for his co-hikers to awaken. I left the hotel and walked around town and stopped by the Lazy Hiker Brewery to have a drink to celebrate Nick's birthday. The Brewery is appropriately named! In the photo from left, Nick, Jaime, Super T (from Scotland),and Spike (from Germany). conductor, Peavy and Graybeard joined us a little later. After lunch I set out to find an outfitter to get some pants and other items. I ended up at Three Eagle Outfitters and found the supplies I needed. I asked if there was a quicker route back to the motel as I had walked a mile and a half (which really should be nothingl to me). The owner was kind enough to volunteer to drive me after she locked up shop. It saved me a lot of walking! The people on the trail have been very welcoming and helpful.Kevin and I had dinner at Mulligans. The food and the atmosphere were good and I met a new hiker who is from Manhattan. Nick was still celebrating his birthday as he should. It only comes once a year.    I am looking forward to having a good hike tomorrow. The forecast is for 72 degrees and sunny.

Baltimore Jack is a volunteer on the trail and he was in the van with us giving us information about the trail. He is very knowledgeable and his advice was well appreciated by all. Junco, Tall One, Conductor, Rue, and myself were dropped off at Winding Stair Gap. Peavy and Graybeard went to Rock Gap, 3.7 miles behind us. Right away there were trail angels there to meet us. They had fruit, snacks, drinks, and burritos. I just ate a banana and started the hike. .As usual, we were climbing. I spent most of the day hiking with Tall One and Conductor We had good clear weather today...it was sunny and cool.Baltimore Jack told us that about .4 miles past Siler Bald Shelter is a grassy area where we should drop our packs and hike up to the left for about 5 minutes. It was great advice cause the views were spectacular on top of Siler Bald. You could see Albert Mountain Fire Tower where we had been a few days ago and you could see Wayah Bald where we were heading. We had quite a hike to reach Wayah Bald. We met up with other hikers there who were taking a break and taking in the sights. Abbey, Moses, Magic Man, Too Tall Conductor and I were all gathered there. There is a stone tower here and again, spectacular views. When we reached Wayah Bald shelter, we were all tired.

I have been calling my hiker friend Tall One but his name is really Tull Wun. Well, Tull Wun had started before me and I caught up with him along the trail then he passed me. That went on for a while...passing each other up!Abby, Moses, Stone and Magic man passed me. I met a few more hikers, Terrible Lizard, Tumbleweed, Deadwood and Hiho.We got some trail magic today at Tellico gap. The angel was called 'I believe'. She had walked the trail in 2014. I got a Coke and some peanut butter crackers. That went great with my Thai tuna lunch. I Believe was actually there to visit with some friends who were hiking the trail and she decided to give out trail magic while she waited. Leaving there I hiked up and reached Wesser Bald Observation Tower. There were beautiful 360 degree views! My pictures just don't do it justice. You need to come and see this for yourself!!!I decided to skip Wesser Bald Shelter and hike on. The forecast was for the rain to start around 3pm so I was taking a chance trying to reach Rufus Morgan Shelter 5 miles further. It was quite a hike and I had to climb down a couple of spots. Other parts were very steep. I got to the shelter 15 minutes too late. It started raining and I had to set up my tent in the rain. Everything got wet. That was not fun!

This place has lodging, a general store, an outfitter, kayaking, white water rafting and a RESTAURANT!! I went straight into the restaurant and ordered two eggs, a sausage, two sweet potato pancakes and toast. It was soooo good. I took my time and charged my phone while I was there. As usual, I ran into a few hikers I had met before. Hiho hurt his leg and was taking a few days off. Deadwoods wife was meeting him and he was taking a couple of days off also. Abbey had family joining her for a few days to hike. I got a couple of things at the outfitter and took off. 2 miles down the road I stopped and opened up my tent and sat there for a while giving it time to dry.I just hiked 6 miles up with a 3000 ft elevation change! It seemed to go on forever. Here is a photo of my AT Guide book. The faint vertical lines indicate 1000 miles of elevation between them. You can see where I have marked off my journey for today and note the vertical zig zag line on the right showing the change in elevation. This is a pretty cool guide book with lots of good information. 
Some days I find my stride and make good time and other days I just trudge along. Today I just trudged along!!!! I finally reached Sassafras Gap Shelter, pitched my tent and made dinner.

After 5 miles, I could barely see the dam. I definitely wasn't going to have any good views today. Tommy and I walked together and because we had a lot in common, we had a lot to talk about. He is a section hiker and has his truck at the Fontana Dam. Once we arrive there, he will drive home (south of Atlanta). He is also a runner and a cyclist. We arrived at Fontana Dam and had trouble getting a signal on our phones to call for the shuttle so we had to backtrack a little to get a signal to make the call.

I went back to the hotel so by the time I got back to the dam it was 10:40 a.m. I hiked by myself mostly. I passed Raw and Moose. It was an uneventful hike. In the Great Smoky Mountains you must camp in a shelter unless the shelter is full. If it is full, thru-hikers must give up the bunk space to section hikers. In that case you would set up your tent next to the shelter. The weather is unpredictable in the Smokies. I got to Mollies Ridge Shelter at 4:45 p.m. I felt tired and my legs were fatigued. This will be my first time sleeping in a shelter. It is a stone shelter with a fireplace. That's good because it may freeze tonight.I met an interesting hiker yesterday.

We stopped at Thunderhead Mountain (5527 elevation) for lunch. Lunchtime has been a good time for me to stop and 'smell the roses' so to speak. There are always wonderful views to take in.
We hiked another 4.5 miles to our shelter for the night, Derrick Knob Shelter and got a campfire going. Everybody had sore shoulders so the girls, Raw, Moose, Maggie, Firefly, Kristen and the lone guy, Pop Tart, created a 'massage circle'. We got in a circle and massaged the shoulders and neck of the person in front of us. We decided to play a game. We would draw something on the back of a person then that person would draw the same thing on the next person and so on. The last person tries to figure out what it is.

It almost seems like I should write, 'as usual'.Since the day before Fontana Dam I have had very bad wifi and phone connections. I have Verizon which has very good service for the trail compared to the other carriers. So, I have been having a hard time getting my dictation and pictures uploaded to Yvonne so that she can post them for me. Sorry for those of my fans that missed my blog.  Moose and Ra (Not Raw as I thought) told me about a free shuttle ride to Gatlinburg from Newfound Gap at 10 a.m. Were were 5 miles away so I got packed up quickly and took off having no breakfast. It was 7:50 a.m. The Forecast was for rain so I had my rain gear on and it was the fastest 5 miles I have done. We got there at 9:55 p.m. The shuttle did not arrive until 10:40 a.m. Moose, Ra, Stone, The Kentucky 3, 3 other guys, and I got the ride into Gatlinburg. The 3 Kentucky guys are Grandaddy Long Legs, Kentucky Rock Hopper and Greg. They are retired from the same company. We had a lot of good conversation. I checked into the Grand Prix Motel then went to eat some BBQ. I got all you can eat salad bar and a pulled pork plate. It was so good. I went back to my room and did laundry, showered and took inventory of my supplies. I noted what I needed to restock on and went shopping in town. As I walked through town I noted that Gatlinburg is a very touristy town but very pretty. The forecast is for rain and wind tomorrow but I still plan on leaving at 9:30 a.m. I plan to do either 10 or 15 miles. It depends on the weather and, of course, my body.

Junco and I had a great breakfast, I had corned beef hash and 2 eggs with toast and oj. We got some bad news when we got back to Grand Prix motel; there was a rock slide and the road was closed. Some hikers who had taken taxis early this morning had to return because they couldn't get to the trailhead. About 9:30am we heard that the road had opened back up so I headed to NOC for the free shuttle I had signed up for the day before. On the way to NOC I had a change of heart and decided to hitchhike instead. I got picked up right away by a couple from Pittsburgh who were on vacation. They happened to be going to the same place I was going. They were going to do a day hike up to Charlie Bunion lookout. I saw them on the trail a couple of times. The rain was holding off and we got some great views from the lookout.Granddaddy Long Legs, Rock Hopper, and Greg caught me (they took the shuttle) and we hiked the rest of the way together. I met up with China and Conundrum later in the day and saw breathtaking views all the way. If we looked west we could see Pigeon Forge and the area around it. To the east was the vast wilderness and no civilization in site, it was amazing. There were many steep drops as well. 
We arrived at Pecks Corner Shelter at 4 p.m. where I met up with Matt, Tree Hugger and Maria. I made some ramen and was in my sleeping bag by 7 p.m. A few more people are coming in and the shelter is getting full.

I hiked a little with China, Conundrum, and Tree Hugger. The views are stunning. Most of the hikers I stayed with went on to the next shelter but it was too far for me (an additional 7.1 miles.)I stayed at Cosby Knob Shelter and it is full! There is a group of 8 section hikers in the shelter and they have priority. All the shelters are not directly on the trail. Pecks Corner Shelter, where I stayed last night, is .5 miles east of the trail. The one I am staying at tonight is only 100 yards east of the trail. It would be great if all the extra miles counted!

It got down to 19 degrees last night so I slept with my water bottles and water filter so they wouldn't freeze.I Got up around 6 a.m. and left a little before 7 a.m. The view right before sunrise was beautiful. Since I left before the sun was up I used my headlamp for the first time. So you understand how cold it was...my water froze when I started walking.Tree Hugger took off first then I left and Pop Tart followed right behind me. There was a lookout 3-4 miles down the road so I dropped my pack and walked the 6/10 of a mile hike to get to it. I got to a stone octagonal lookout (Mt. Cammerer Trail) and it was very windy but the view was spectacular..  I walked mostly by myself today but we passed each other several times during the day. It got into the 40's so I was able to take off some clothes. Gerard is a 20 year old kid that has been at the last two camps. We hiked the last two miles to the hostel together.I have to tell you how Tree Hugger got his name. There are marks on some trees along the Appalachian Trail that are painted on trees with white paint. They are called Blazes and are put on the North and South side of some trees. These markers help us to be sure that we are on the right track. Sometimes they are 50 yards apart, sometimes 100 yards. Well, everytime there is a tree with a blaze on it, he hugs it thus the name Tree Hugger. He wears a kilt which is favored by a few hikers and he hugs the trees to thank them for showing us the way. I had to get a permit to enter the Great Smoky Mountains. When we enter we tear a part of the permit and put it in a box. When we exit we put the other half in the box so that the rangers can keep up with who is still in the Park. I dropped my other half in today when I exited the park.
I wasn't sure that I would make it to this shelter tonight but I did. This is the highest amount of miles that I have walked in a day. Unfortunately I ended up with a blister yesterday. It will probably be worse today so I guess I will have to nurse it tonight.

They came back to give back. This is their fourth day at Brown Gap Giving Trail Magic. This is a very nice family and the father is a fellow Aggie. They are from Fort Worth, Texas.There was a family from Chicago that hiked a couple of miles with me today.

It was soooo cold. When I took off about 9 a.m. it was still very cold and windy. Abby and Stone who passed me about an hour later are going to Hot Springs. That is my destination also, about 13 miles away. When I reached the top of a mountain, all of the tree branches were frosted over. Shortly after that it started snowing. It reminded me of Christmas. Several hours later it warmed into the mid 40's.Something funny happened on the trail near Hot Springs, I passed a hiker who was 60 years old then came up on two other hikers on the trail who were talking. One was 67 years old and the other 85!! So, in a group of 4 hikers, I was the youngest! That may not happen again.When I got to Hot Springs there were Trail Angels who happened to be Deadwoods (another hiker) parents. I spent some time with them then went into town and checked into the Iron Horse Inn. Yvonne booked the room for me and she will be coming in tomorrow, woohoo!!!!!!! Since I got in a day earlier than expected I found someone to drive me 15 miles up the trail so that I can hike back to Hot Springs.

I can't wait for Yvonne (my wife) to arrive today, this is the longest stretch I have been without her. Since she will not arrive until night time I decided to do some slackpacking. That is when you walk without your pack and somebody picks you up. You still cover that section of the AT but without the added weight of the pack. I found someone to drive me to Allen Gap, 14+ miles down the trail and I hiked back to town. I met my ride at 9am and started walking at 9:35am. It was chilly and windy as usual. It was a clear morning and I passed about 25 hikers. I knew about 10 of them who I had met at different stages of the hike. It is amazing how even when someone is faster or slower than you, eventually you meet up again. It was a nice walk and amazing how light I felt without the pack. I could get used to this, any volunteers out there wanting to come out and pick me up each day??????????? Ha ha. It was nice catching up with some of the hikers.The highlight was walking onto Lovers Leap Rock and sitting there overlooking the French Broad River and Hot Springs, just beautiful. I could have stayed there for hours. The trail finished with a walk along the river then I crossed the bridge back into town. I am staying at the Iron Horse Inn, a renovated warehouse by the railroad track which used to be a boarding house. They did a great job on the renovation with modern facilities while keeping the old style. I washed my clothes and took a shower then relaxed a while. They have a restaurant here so I went down stairs to it and had a couple of glasses of wine while I waited for Yvonne. She finally arrive at 9:40pm to many hugs and kisses.

Yvonne and I walked to the diner for breakfast and ran into many hikers who Yvonne had heard about and who I have not seen in a few days. Stitch joined us at breakfast and we had a good catch up. I was able to introduce Yvonne to China, Conundrum, Justin(who is now Mudpuppy) Ryan, Simon, Deadwood and his parents. We all decided that we would meet at the Spring Creek Tavern in the evening. We just had a lazy day, walked around a bit and just spent time on the internet doing some research on equipment. I think I can still get the weight of my pack down. It is hovering around 36 lbs with water and food. Since being on the trail I have talked to many hikers and gotten tips on what I could do to reduce weight. One of the things I need to do now is to replace my gloves. They are not doing a good job of keeping my fingers warm on those cold days. I started with two types of socks to hike in...Smart Wool thick hiking socks, and Darn Tough socks with liners. The Smart Wool socks worked well at first but I started getting the sensation that I was getting blisters on my toes. I didn't end up having blisters but I think it was close. I taped my toes to avoid it. I started using the Darn Tough socks and that was better. I will send the wool socks home and get another set of Darn Tough with a liner. I think I do a good job of holding my pack's weight down by limiting the amount of water I carry. There are many water sources along the trail. The big changes in weight will come when the weather gets warmer and I can reduce clothing and change out my sleeping bag. More to come on that later. We went to visit the Hot Springs Spa and it was fantastic! Hot Springs got its name because it has this body of Natural Hot Mineral Springs running through it. It was discovered in 1778 by a group of mountaineer white settlers. There were things that were found around the springs that supported the claim that the Cherokee Indians use the springs and believed in their magical curative powers many many years ago. The spa offers private soaks in the hot tubs that are placed around the river and creek around the property. They are fenced in but open to the elements. We rented one of them and relaxed in the hot, bubbling water for an hour. It was heaven! 
We went to the Tavern and met up with everybody plus Junco, Pat, Meagan, Conductor, Moose, Ra, China, Conundrum, Tree Hugger and others. It was a good night for catching up and telling trail stories.","Allen Gap

Hot Springs is a very small town so we are able to walk to just about anything we need. We visited the library and spent some time there then we took a drive up to the AT trail. I took Yvonne down the trail a bit to a lake I had passed a couple days ago. It was a nice spot and Yvonne enjoyed the walk and experienced the beauty and views that the hikers see. She also got to see some blazes. I didn't mention before that the blazes have to show you when to turn right and left also. There will be two marks on the tree and one will be a little raised. If the raised one is to the right you turn right and if it is to the left, you turn left. The weather forecast had called for rain all yesterday afternoon and today but fortunately for us, they were wrong. We had pretty good weather for most of the day.  We saw something very interesting today. We were in front of the hikers ministry when a truck pulled up on the bridge and we were wondering what they were doing. They opened up some containers on their truck and started taking out some fish in a net. They threw them into the river! We figured out that they were restocking the waters with trout since part of the economy in Hot Springs is fishing. If you look carefully in the photo you can see the fish in the air heading to the water. I am determined to get the weight of my pack down so I have taken out what I want to return with Yvonne and I weighed my pack at the outfitters. My pack without my food is 23.6 so lets average it out to 25 since I need to add one or two small items. My food/water will add another 10 lbs but that will be reduced each day. I am looking forward to shedding more as the warm weather comes in. At the outfitter I bought some new gloves and socks then came to the room to relax. The Tavern was our choice for dinner tonight so we went there around 6 p.m. and joined Conductor and Black Bear. Dinner and conversation were good as always. I can never tire of hearing the trail stories.Later this evening we went down to the restaurant to have a glass of wine and ran into some hikers. We then went back to the Tavern and caught up with a few hikers including Tumbleweed, Jason, Nesquick, John of many names, Dennis and Bearclaw. Yvonne talked to two female hikers who were making a documentary of female hikers on the AT. It sounds like it is going to be a great documentary. You can check them out at thruatdoc.com, Patrice and Lindsey. Movies like this tend to show the beauty of the country we live in. So many people do not get to see this. Check out the movie Mile, Mile and a Half. It is a fantastic documentary about the John Muir Trail. I am sure you will enjoy it. I feel relaxed and ready to get back on the trail.

Firstly, let me say that I absolutely did not write all that information about Oscar longing to see me!!! I want to remind you that he dictates his information to me and I just write it in the blog and 'refine' it not changing the context.  Secondly, I am in awe of my husband. What an undertaking!! He has told me that he loves this lifestyle and that he could live like this indefinitely. I can see how it can be loved (to an extent). It must be liberating to know that this, hiking the trail at your own pace, is your only focus day after day. You get up when you want to; you decide how far you are going to walk each day; you decide if you are going to have a zero day or nero day(walking nearly zero miles), you have no-one to report to. You can sit and look at the beauty of the earth that you behold as long as you want to. You don't have the stresses of a 'normal' life whether it be your job or family or traffic. Yes, I think it is liberating. Of course things like where you sleep at night and how you go about using the bathroom and how often you get to shower are things that would make me think really long and hard about walking the Appalachian Trail.I have met so many of his trail friends/family and each one has such a different story on why they are here walking the trail. It really fascinates me. Our days were spent walking here and there through the town and every few steps Oscar stopped to have a conversation with hikers that he has met on the trail. At just about all the meals we had we shared a table with other hikers. It is like a fraternity of brothers and sisters on the road. I was actually amazed that there were so many ladies on the trail. In years gone by the record shows that a small percentage of the hikers are women but it might be different this year if what I saw in Hot Springs is any indication. Oscar spoke to many people and read many blogs before he left for the AT. One thing that was pretty consistent is that you will lose some weight on the trail. Even though he told me he lost weight and I expected him to lose weight I was shocked when I saw how much he lost in just 4 weeks! He looks great!!! Of course he feels like he is too skinny. This is some motivation for some of you who want to lose weight. Come and join Oscar!We stayed in Hot Springs where the main road is literally on the trail. We drove a little way out of town and Oscar escorted me to a part of the trail where there was a lake. It was quiet, serene and beautiful. While I walked with him I said to myself, ""I can do this"" but I know I have no desire to do this for 6 months. I will continue to live vicariously through Oscar but somewhere along the trail I will join him and walk for more than an hour. At least I have another part of the trail under my belt.",,Hot Springs,"Apr 09, Sat",0

A couple who got into the diner right about the same time as us sat down first then offered the other half of their booth to us. We accepted. We had a good conversation with them. They live in a nearby town and they were on their way to Tennessee. They get out each weekend and travel and enjoy time together. I believe that we are around the same age and were able to share stories about our children and lives. This was a very nice couple; it is really nice to meet people. Some have a lot of similarities to our lives and some are so very different. In either case, it is always interesting. We ended up giving them our phone numbers and inviting them to Baytown. They treated us to breakfast!We went back to the hotel and checked out and I took my pack to have it weighed one more time. 34.1 lbs. That is pretty good!!

Yvonne drove me to Allen Gap so I could start hiking where I left off and we said our goodbyes.  I started hiking and there was Trail Magic almost right away. The Trail Angel is a man who lives in a cabin about 25 miles away from the trail. He has hiked a good part of the trail, 900 miles, and he enjoys doing this. I got an oatmeal raisin cookie, a peanut butter chocolate square, chocolate milk and some chips. It stayed cold the whole day today. The higher I got the colder it got. At Allen Gap it was 34 degrees and I climbed 2500 ft. For every 1000 ft the temperature drops about 3.5 degrees. So it was about 24 degrees give or take. Add wind to that and it is COLD!
I got to the shelter first and soon I was joined by three guys section hiking, Tree Hugger and a girl from Australia. There were a few other hikers but they camped in their tent. We started a fire in the shelter. All of the shelters in the Smoky's had fire places and this is one of the few outside of the smoky's that has one. Being first in the shelter has its privileges...I had the spot in front of the fire.  It went out during the night so when I woke up I started it up again.

I heard him but did not want to get out of my sleeping bag because...you guessed it...it was cooooooold and windy! Brian was next up then we all started to move. Orange pacer took off at 7:15 am. The rest of us left about 8 am. The guys stopped for breakfast but I decided to hike a little further so I could eat breakfast away from the wind. I was able to talk to Yvonne on the phone without the wind taking my words down the trail. Conundrum, China, Brian, Justin, Sago and I hooked up again. We walked together the rest of the way, about 7 miles. I lagged back a little and caught some great pictures of the group hiking. It was a really beautiful day.We went up some balds with great views. You may be wondering why we call some of these places 'balds'. Well it is because these areas are devoid of trees hence, they are bald. They really aren't though as many of them have brush and grass growing over them. I am taking a lot of photos but they really don't do the land any justice. We finally got over the last bald and headed downhill and out of the wind. The lower we got the warmer it was. It got so warm that when we reached Doll Flats we shed some layers. From there we went nonstop making great time to arrive at Interstate 19E at 1:15 pm. Our guidebooks directed us .3 miles west the Mountain Harbor Hostel. This was the end of the road for Brian, Justin and Sago. Their section hike is over so now they are getting a ride back to hot springs for some cheeseburgers, beers and their vehicle to head back home. I hate losing good hiking partners but I know I will meet many more good hiking partners along the way. We will definitely stay in touch.
The hostel is upstairs from an old barn...probably the hayloft. It is pretty cool. There are three others up in the loft with me and a couple on a king bed off the main room. It has two baths and a small kitchen like an efficiency. Orange Pacer and I got a ride from the owner in to town. Yvonne sent a resupply box to the post office and I was going to pick it up. It turned out I was in the wrong town, I went to Roan TN instead of Elk Park, NC!! It was the other way down the road. About 6 miles. Anyway I was hungry so we went to a BBQ place. I do have my priorities!!! We hitch hiked to Elk Park and got there in time to pick the package up. We hitchhiked back to the shelter and proceeded to wash clothes, shower and get everything organized. It is good to have a support system and I definitely do. I just hung out and visited with other hikers, including China and Conundrum. Some hikers ate while we watched a couple of movies. The last one was City Slickers. Remember that one? It was good to see it again. I am going to sleep now and looking forward to the breakfast buffet in the main house. I just love to eat!","Stan Murray Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528232,"Mountain Harbor is a B&B as well as a hostel. I stayed in the hostel and China and Conundrum stayed in a treehouse. It didn't have electricity but after staying in tents and shelters, who cares. Conundrum said that the mattress was very comfortable so if you are heading this way, you may want to try it out. For $12 you could partake in their fantastic gourmet breakfast. What a spread! It was worth every penny. After breakfast I gathered up my things and started on the trail around 9:45 am. I passed Stitch a little way down the road and a beautiful long waterfall. I arrived at Moreland Gap Shelter and its a good thing I did because I was on my last bit of energy. China, Conundrum, Monster(6'6"" 196lb), Wanderer, Birdman, Sweet Potato and Oreo were here already. Sweet Potato who is a veterinarian got her name because she loves sweet potatoes and can't stop talking about them. It is such a small world. After some conversation we found out that Sweet Potato's mother was actually a professor and she taught China and Conundrum in nursing school! Amazing.  We all ate and chatted while I got myself organized. There were signs posted saying that there is no camping between Rd321 and Watauga Dam due to bear activity so we have to plan our tomorrow carefully. It is either a 15 or 20 mile hike tomorrow. China and Conundrum are staying in a hostel 12 miles away and the rest of us are going to try to make it across the dam. How far I travel depends on my energy and feet. The bottom of my feet have been hurting for the past 4 days. It is like I am going to get blisters but then I don't. I have been taping the bottom of my feet so we will see.
Wanderer is playing his ukulele in his tent and it sounds really good. It makes me feel like I am in Tahiti. BTW, I just found out his name is spelt Juanderer!","US - Mountain Harbor Hostel

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528414,"Last night I had my first mouse experience. I heard a noise in the shelter that was pretty persistent. I couldn't figure out what it was so I used my light to see if I could figure it out. It was a mouse!! I lay down for maybe 60 minutes And couldn't sleep. It was time to pitch my tent!! After that, I slept like a baby. . This was a great day to hike. I walked a bit with China and Conundrum. They went to Bear Hostel for the night. Caught up to Juan Durer and Sweet Potato at laurel falls which was sooo beautiful. It is definitely a must day hike for a family outing. It was nice to hike along creeks most of the day and to walk along the Upper Laurel creek was fantastic. I walked with Juan Durer and had conversations about our travels. We have both traveled to many places. Magic man passed me while I was getting water. I had not seen him in a week. I am at top of a Mountain and am going to try to make it past the dam. The temp is in the 60's and clear. It is a great day for a long hike??
While Juan Durer and I were going down the mountain you could see Watauga lake and a controlled burn forest fire on the opposite end. We got to the lake and caught up to Sweet Potato by the lake. I took my shoes and shirt off and got in the lake and washed my face and chest. It felt so refreshing. We hiked 5 more miles past the forest fire which was smoldering. It was eerie looking. We met up with Monster and Oriole and camped about 1/2 mile past the dam next to the road. We ate dinner together and then relaxed. Juan Durer is playing his ukelele. This is very relaxing. Monster and I are laying in the street looking up at the bats while Juan Durer plays on. This is just great!
I am planning on hiking 18 miles tomorrow. Time for bed.","Moreland Gap Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528502,"I was awakened at 1am by Monster and Juan Durer. A bear had gotten 2 of our food bags!!! I forgot to mention that Sojo came late yesterday and camped with us. Oriole and Sojo's bags were taken by a tree climbing bear. We grabbed mine and rehung it on a different tree. It was exciting, I was going to see a bear! We heard it and scared it off but did not get to see it.  They said it was a small one. Now let's see if I can go too sleep!!! 
I woke up at just before light. We went looking for the food storage bag remnants and found oriole's partial bag. It had some tea bags and a lighter. We pooled whatever food we had together and shared it so that everyone had enough for 2 days and nights. Our plan is to push hard for Damascus, Virginia for resupply. I had a nice hike today. There was great weather again. We could see lake Watauga for about 8 miles. It was pretty. I started getting sluggish around mile 10. With the mouse incident 2 nights ago then the bear incident last night, I have not gotten a full night's sleep in a few days. I will try to catch up tonight. I ran into Monster, Oriole, Canuck(Canadian), Moon Boots, and Clutch from time to time today. We arrived at Double Springs Shelter at 6:10pm. 
Bombadil and Gold Berry are here. I met them at the start of my hike but have not seen them again until now. They are a married couple from Massachusetts and their two daughters are on the trail too. They are about two days behind and closing in fast. Also here is Portugal and a couple of other guys whose names I have forgotten. I got some trail magic today...a Pepsi and some sweets. The Pepsi went down great!!! 
My group is planning to reach Damascus tomorrow and tent at a church hostel. I may do the same. This a good group to travel with.","Wilbur Dam Road

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528839,"I woke up just before day light and I felt great...finally an uninterrupted sleep. As I got up I saw what I thought was a wild boar. It was just a silhouette and I walked closer to it. As I got closer I heard a noise to my left and turned my head lamp on. It was two deer. The smaller one came within 10 ft of me and I moved so he would not get closer. That was very cool. I had biscuits and gravy for breakfast and it was good. I got off at 7:40am and again, it was a beautiful day. There were not as many views as the previous day's but it was easier hiking. Finally I am in Virginia!! Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee are behind me but Virginia has about 1/4 of the trail in it, about 555 miles. It will be a long traverse. The rest of the hike was gradually downhill so I made great time. I got to pretty and clean Damascus at 3:15pm. The trail goes right through town like it did in Hot Springs except this town is bigger. I'm staying at a church hostel where you can camp on the grounds and you get a towel plus use of the shower and kitchen for a donation of $7. Not bad. I left my bag at the church and took my clothes to wash at Crazy Larry's Hostel. Sweet potato, Oriole and Monster were there too. I was last in line to get my things washed. Crazy Larry actually washes for you!! He and I had a long conversation about everything including his life. Interesting.","Double Springs Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528891,"Good morning! I woke up to birds chirping and singing. I thought it was around 7am but it was 5am. These birds sure get up early!!!! I got up and headed to a cafe for breakfast with Monster, Sweet Potato, Juan Durer and Oriole. I had blueberry pancakes and a couple cups of hot tea. I could probably write a book on ""Things You Think About While Your Hiking"", so I will begin to share some of those thoughts. GEAR! I think about reducing my pack weight including amount of food, water, lighter pack, lighter sleeping bag/pad, cooking system, clothes and other things I carry that maybe I could do without. I probably started the hike at about 37 lbs. when I left Hot Springs I was at 34.1 with food and water which is better but would still like to get lighter. My backpack is an Osprey Atmos 65 liter AG. It wears very well but weighs about 4 lbs 6oz. I am considering switching to an Osprey Exos 58 liter, it weighs about 2 lbs 4oz. That would be a start. It holds less but I could send some winter clothes home and reduce the amount of food I carry. I always seem to have plenty of food anyway. The water I can definitely regulate with good planning.  I spent some time walking around town this afternoon. It is very clean and picturesque with lots of bike shops. Apparently it is a biking destination. We walked to the grocery store, while Juan Durer, Sweet Potato, Savage and Monster ate what they bought, Oriole and I ate at a pizza buffet. I did not overdue it like last time.  I ran into Maria. I didn't think I would run into her again. She was going to leave town later today. Savage and Maria walked 30 miles to get into town, WOW! We walked back and I just lazied around and caught up with home, and emails. Chena and Conundrum were staying at the hostel behind us as well as Stitch, Poptart, Goodberry, Bombadil and Sojo. Chena and Conundrum came over and we talked gear. They bought new packs, so tomorrow I will try one of their old ones which is the Exos 58. I will see if my gear will fit in it. Oriole and I went to dinner at Subway then bought some beer on the way back. We went to the hostel behind us and Sojo was celebrating his birthday. There were a lot of us there. We stayed there the rest of the night and chatted about the trail. Yvonne called from Guatamala where she is on her mission trip. It is always good to hear her voice. I miss my wife. Tomorrow I will continue the gear conversation. I have decided to take another zero day since my blisters are still bothering me. Hope to have another good night's sleep.

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529074,"I woke up to singing birds again. I got up and went and had breakfast with the crew and ran into Blackbear and Ryan who is now known as Ralphie. I had a good time talking with everyone. When I came back to the hostel, I gathered my stuff to try and fit in Chena's old backpack. Like I said yesterday they, Chena and Conundrum, switched to ULA backpacks and I will try her Osprey Exos 58 which is just over 2 lbs lighter than mine. With their help I got every thing in, the pack felt good as I walked around a bit. I decided to switch and I will purchase the pack from them. Conundrum said to try it a few days then we'll talk compensation. Sounds good to me! I will be mailing my pack home along with my winter clothes. I know I'm taking a chance but I need to get lighter. I also went ahead and lanced my two blisters, cleaned them up and I am hoping that I can hike tomorrow. Juan Durer, Sweet Potato, Monster and Oriole left around 11am. They were great hiking partners. I hope to see them again. I went to the outfitter and bought some individual toe sock liners and a pair of shorts. My feet and blisters still hurt but maybe all this will help. I went to the post office and mailed my pack and clothes home and I will check my pack weight tomorrow.  The local library is showing a free movie, Creed, with popcorn and drinks at 4pm. We are not missing that! We plan on going to a local brewery afterwards. I walked over to the library with the hostel caretaker, Bayou and mmet up with Portuguese, Chena, Conundrum and Ralphie. The movie and snacks were great! Chena, Conundrum, Ralphie and I walked over to the Damascus brewery but I started feeling bad before we got there and it got worse. It was a nice place but I left early and walked back to the hostel.I got sick and had bad stomach pains. I must have eaten something bad. My friends brought me some pepto and Gatorade.

I drank plenty of Gatorade and took some pepto before I packed up and walked over to the outfitter to weigh my pack. I am now at 33 lbs. I am getting it lower but I still would like to be lower. I ran into Stone and visited for a while. Saw Chena and Conundrum and thanked them for helping me last night. They are staying in Damascus one more night. I'm sure they will catch me later. It was raining when I got up but it stopped for a while. I am heading out but I stopped at Cowboys for breakfast and it started raining again. Looks like I will have to wear my rain gear today. It is 100% chance for rain for the next few hours. I may have to sleep in a shelter tonight. I'll see. I am trying to avoid them due to mice. There is a shelter about 8 miles and another 15 miles away. Since it is almost noon, I may just stop at the first shelter.  After I left Damascus it rained the whole time. There were no views but the rain helped to fill some nice creeks and small waterfalls. I hiked along the Virginia Creeper Trail which is made of crushed rock and is wide. There was a bridge on the trail that had washed out so we had to take a detour on the Creeper Trail. It goes along a very wide creek. It is nice to hear the running water. I arrived at Saunders Shelter at 3:30 pm. It had stopped raining but it was very misty and humid. I set up in the shelter then ate while other hikers started coming in. I ended up with Feral, Pop Tart, Highway, Crisscross and Sunray in the shelter. Crisscross and Sunray are from Switzerland. They have very strong accents and quit their jobs and sold everything to do the hike. This is their first time in the United States. They plan on going to San Francisco next then Canada to visit a friend. Their visa is for 6 months so they want to finish the trail by late August. Stone and Owl camped out next to the shelter. We all turned in by 6:30pm. It was a little cold so it felt good to be in my sleeping bag. A very bad storm hit around 9:30pm. There was lightning and it poured for about 2 hours.

I had a couple day hikers pass me then another. I asked if there was a group and they shared that they were part of a cystic fibrosis fund raising 30 mile hike. There were about 70 hikers. I started talking to a couple from the North Carolina coast. They invited me to partake in their aid station. Yum yum, PBJ, snack bar, chips, pickles and Gatorade. I hiked along and it was rainy or misty the whole way. I talked to a couple of other day hikers from Chattanooga who have been doing the hike for a few years. The couple I talked to have been doing it for 8 years. They have raised around $350,000 as a group and donations are still coming in. What a great event! I was able to eat at the second aid station as well.I went the last part of the group's 30 mile hike with the couple from the coast and talked about many things...mostly kids and rental properties. I arrived on top of Mount Rogers at Thomas Knob shelter. It was cold and windy. It is a large shelter that holds 16. Crisscross, Sunray, Feral, Portuguese, Wonder, Justice, Polar Bear, and Ahab also arrived. There were many weekend tent hikers around. The views are supposed to be amazing but with all the mist, there are no views. Hopefully tomorrow. For dinner I had ramen and tuna again, still tasting great!!
My thought today was that I sure miss drinking my wine, I started with a small wine rack then graduated to two larger racks (his and hers), then Santa brought me a small wine refrigerator. I must have been good!!! Now everything is full unless my friends like Pauline have been coming and drinking it! I have a brilliant idea...turn the pantry into a wine cooler, the wash room into a pantry and add on to back of garage for a roomy wash room.

I left the shelter at 7:40am and I was not expecting the wonderful views. You will see from the pictures...there are lots to see. I entered the Grayson Highlands area which looks like what I think Ireland would look like. The area is also known for its wild ponies. They have hair like Shetlands but are a little bigger and they roam the area. I got to see them up close too. The scenery is probably the best I have seen so far. I will definitely come back here. When I started walking this morning there was frost on the ground and since I sent my winter clothes home, I used a pair of socks for my hands. After a couple of miles it warmed enough to take off a layer. I have not seen much wildlife during the whole trip just some squirrels, chipmunks, and deer. I did get close to a young deer one morning and that was pretty cool.In the highlands I saw lots of ponies, cows, bulls, a snake, and my first rabbit. Can you believe, five hundred miles on the trail and I just saw a rabbit? Amazing! I stopped at a shelter for a snack and break and met 5 weekend hikers. I took a picture of them and two amazing ladies, Ziplock, and Repack. They were doing a long section hike in full gear. They were in their mid and upper 60's, very inspiring. I also met Spaniard and he is from Spain. He is also pretty amazing. There are 5 long trails in Spain and he did them all before he was 18 yrs old. He's done a lot of European country trails, southern Mexico and did the PCT last year. I hiked with him for a few miles and we spoke in Spanish. He does 25 miles a day and get this, he is 67 yrs old!!!! I could just keep up. I stopped at Hurricane Mtn Shelter at 5pm and he kept going. He said he would stop at 7 pm.    I didn't stay in the shelter. I walked down to the creek and set up my tent next to Cheddar...I just met her. She had been doing high miles too but got an injury so she will slow down a while.Three ladies joined us, I had met them briefly while they were taking a break on the trail. Mary, Siva and Faye. They are also section hiking for quite a ways. I ate dinner with all four ladies and we had some good conversations. These three ladies are also my age and older and again amazing women.

It was heavy with vegetation where we camped. I got my bear bag and got everything packed. There have not been bear cables at the shelters for quite a while so we have to find a tree and throw our rope to hang the bags. Sometimes there are just not any good trees so we have to go far to find one. That was the case at Thomas Knob Shelter. I finally found an ok tree then my rope got stuck so I had to climb the tree to set the rope. Hmmmm. If I can climb it the bear can too! Well there wasn't a bear that night so I was ok. I said my goodbyes to the ladies and got going at 7:20am. It is amazing to see that there are so many hikers, male and female, that are my age or older. It was a nice morning with temperatures around the upper 40's but within an hour, it was getting close to 60 degrees!. It was another nice and clear beautiful day for a hike. I saw a cow that was right in my path. I said to it, ""Move along doggy (as we say to cows in Texas) but it didn't move. I guess it wasn't a Texan cow!There weren't many views today...it was very wooded. I ran into Clutch, Medicine Man and Shaggy. They camped about 1.5 miles past me. They always pass me then I catch up while their taking a break. Stone passed me then I caught them all when we stopped for lunch at Trimpi Shelter. We had traveled 9 miles at that point and needed 10 more to reach Partnership Shelter. My phone service has been very poor but I managed to talk to Yvonne once I reached the top of a small mountain. I caught Stone and walked with him to the shelter. We made great time, 10 miles in 3 hrs 40 min.This shelter is by the Rogers Mountain Visitors Center. You can call to have pizza delivered and it also has a shower. Zebra and Ginger were already there. They are section hiking. Owl and Pilgrim arrived as well. Bayonne and I ordered a pizza each. Not sure I can eat it all but I will finish it at breakfast if I don't. Stone took a shower while I waited then I took one. It was coooold but refreshing. I hand washed a couple of clothing items as well.A few more hikers came in including Cheddar, Crisscross and Sunray, a couple. Crisscross and Sunray were ahead of me and they arrived at the shelter early. They took the shuttle to town to resupply and came back to the sheltr. It was good to see them.

We looked at each other and kind of laughed and said wow! Just a few steps slower and...who knows! So, if anybody asks, ""If a tree falls in the woods can you hear it?"" The answer is, if your close enough YES!!! I woke up to Crisscross's alarm. He is very regimented. He has a schedule and a plan to where he and Sunray will be and how much food they will have. He wakes up and starts his routine. He and Sunray, his other half, work well as a team. They are always the first to leave. I got out at 7:20am...good time. My plan was to make it to the outskirts of Atkins and eat at the Barn Restaurant for lunch, at 11 miles. I made a big boo boo! I took off my pack about a mile from the shelter to fix something then kept going. 4 miles later I was making good time and I reached for my phone...it wasn't there. It had fallen out. I figured it fell out when I took my pack off. I took my pack off and left it right there while I started backtracking asking hikers on the way if they had seen it. I did meet a couple who were day hiking and they asked me if I was El Tejano. They were following my blog and complimented me on it. I let them know it was a team effort with my wife. That was pretty cool and it cheered me up to think that I am somewhat of a celebrity.  I continued on worried that I would not find it and would lose all information and photos that I had on it. Sure enough it fell right where I thought. So, I went 4 miles back and 4 miles to where my backpack was. 8 miles of AT hiking that actually didn't count!!!!! That was no fun. I got going again and got to see a couple of great views coming into Atkins, Virginia. I came up on Zebra taking a break in front of an old one room schoolhouse. There was trail magic inside. You just helped yourself and left a donation if you wanted to. The schoolhouse was well preserved and the magic was great. I did not eat much since I was determined to eat at the Barn Restaurant. I finally got to my late late lunch about 2:15pm. I ordered pulled pork with peas and macaroni salad and iced tea...wonderful! I stayed a couple of hours, charged my phone and was joined by Zebra. I decided to stay in this town and not hike any more for the day. I walked over to a motel. Taking a shower, sleeping in a bed and washing clothes sounded good. My feet were hurting.

My right foot is still a little swollen, but once I put my boots on it felt a little better. I ate breakfast with Sponge Bob at The Barn Restaurant and got an egg sandwich to go. That sandwich will be good for lunch. Sponge Bob is a retired physician from Hawaii. He was very pleasant to talk to. He was also at the last place I stayed in Damascus. It is very misty this morning and it is drizzling a bit. The forecast is for rain all day. My goal is to reach the Knot Maul Branch shelter which is 14 miles away. It should not be a problem as I mentioned before I like walking in the rain.I left the Barn at 9:15am and I had my rain gear on since it was drizzling and misty. Within a mile, the sun came out and I took the rain gear off...it gets hot with it on. The hike was up and down with nice meadow views. I came up on a hiker going the opposite direction, south bound. He started last summer hiking south from Maine, broke for the winter and started up again, he is 3/4 through. If you finish the whole trail within 12 months it is considered a thru hike. Not a bad way to do it, you get a long break. His name was Rosy Eagle. His wife hikes with him sometimes and she told him that he notices everything and always has a 'rosy' way of describing the trail. That is how he got his trail name. I chatted with him a while. He is 74 years old!! These older hikers are definitely inspiring me to stay active. I hiked some more and came across another southbound hiker named Bean who is flip flopping. That means starting in a spot and going one direction then coming back to where you started and going the other direction. There are many reasons why people do this..weather...avoid the crowds... convenience. Bean is from Missouri City Texas which is not far from my home town. I passed Zebra, I know that Zebras are in Africa but there is definitely one on the trail!! I also passed Cold Snap and Diesel, a couple from Massachusetts. You can definitely tell that Spring is here. There is much more green everywhere. It started raining an hour before I reached the shelter but I didn't stop to put on my gear because it was refreshing and not that cold. It felt great since I was climbing. The rain stopped just before I got to the shelter and nobody was there. I cleaned out the shelter and set up my sleeping bag and pad. I went to get water and washed up. I soaked my feet in the stream. That felt really good. Cold Snap and Diesel arrived while I was having dinner, then Ralphie and Zebra arrived.

Half mile further I ran into a trail devil..at least that's what he called himself. He offered me a beer...aaaaaa sure I'll take one. It went down good as I walked down the trail. Later I met another hiker, Wildcard. He was taking a break. The walking was tough for quite a few miles as there were so many rocks on the trail. The trail followed a ridge right after Garden Mountain. Although it was a tough hike, it had some nice views and neat rock formations. It is starting to get greener on parts of the trail. I arrived at Jenkins shelter at 6:49 pm. This was a long day of hiking. I was the only one there. Coldsnap and Diesel arrived then Ralphie. We had dinner and conversation. I had Ramen, tuna, mixed nuts, carrots and hot sauce mixed together. It was great!! Dessert was a honey bun which went down well with my wine!!! The others had hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps. We were all happy!","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530719,"It's a wonderful Friday morning. Did I mention that it is nice to wake up and your fingers are not getting numb from the cold in a matter of minutes? Well, it is! I had a freeze dried Breakfast Skillet by Mountain House. It was very good but too much. A lot of the dried food packs come in servings for 2+. I made a sandwich for later with the leftovers. Mountain House has been the best brand of freeze dried that I have tasted. The others are ok and I will eat them but this brand is always good. I got going at 7:35am and the weather was a little overcast. It did not rain last night so the trail should not be too muddy. The trail was great today. I made good time to Laurel Creek which is very pretty with a series of cascades. I stayed there a while to take a break. I could stay much longer but... I filled my water bottles up because there is a lack of water sources further up the trail. I've been nursing my feet lately especially my right pinky toe. In Damascus I purchased Injinji sock liners which have individual toe spots hoping that would keep me from getting toe blisters. They felt good except for my pinky toe, it hurt really badly. I went back to my normal liners but it still hurt. I guess the damage was done already. I then taped my toe but it was the same. This morning I put the Injinji's back on and cut off the pinky toe part, I'll see how that works.I hiked up through many Rhododendron patches. Rhododendrons are 10-15 ft tall shrubs with broad waxy leaves. They grow in thick patches that the trail sometimes tunnels through. They bloom and their flowers are in large bouquets of ruffled pink. I have been going through many patches of these since I started but none that have started blooming. Can't wait to see that. Had many great views of the country side today. My feet still hurt but not as much as they have the past few days. My pinky toe is doing ok. I may have finally made the right move on it. I was planning to stop at Helveys Mill Shelter but it was 0.3miles off the trail. I am on a mission so I decided to move on and picked a spot on the trail to stop and eat lunch. I was about 14 miles from start. I am planning on reaching Jenny Knob Shelter which would be a 25 mile day, my longest so far. I met Gypsy on the trail heading south to Damascus. He is going to stay for Trail Days. I will have to make that event in the future. For lunch I had my egg sandwich, some cheese, jerky and peanut butter snickers. I loaded up so I would have some energy to make it 11 more miles.I made good time to the shelter. It was a nice hike, mostly on a ridge, where I had some great views. I reached Jenny Knob Shelter at 5:30pm. Bombadil and Goldberry were here as well as a few others. I soaked my feet in the creek and they are feeling better. Tomorrow I will hike to Woods Hole Hostel. It is about 22 miles away. It is supposed to rain tomorrow though. I had a really nice evening. The high is in the 60's. We had dinner then we just hung out. I will sleep good tonight.","Jenkins Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530847,"I woke to a damp and humid morning. I drank a Breakfast Essentials and coconut powdered milk for breakfast. That gives me lots of vitamins and calories but I will have to eat something in 2-3 hours. I left at 7:10am. The weather is probably in the low 50's and the forecast is for rain all day. I had a nice walk and the rain did not come for a long time. I came up on 3 hikers about my age, Hong Kong Steve (yes, he is from there), Freight Train and Sparky from Washington State. I'm sure I will see them again. I came up to Kimberling Creek suspension bridge which is pretty cool. I decided to hike on and left my pack just off the trail to hike 0.3 miles to Dismal Falls (what a name). It was definitely worth the side trip. I met Red Bear and Doc there. I had heard of Red Bear. He hikes mostly at night because he wants to avoid the sun because he burns easily...fun guy. I ate a snack and got water but my water bag broke. That is not good. I will have to adjust how I get my water till I can get another one. I ended up spending about 45 minutes there. It was a pretty hike even with overcast skies. The trail meandered through Rhododendron patches and in some spots it was going through tunnels of these shrubs. There was also a creek along the trail for a few miles. There were lots of creek crossings. Got to Wapiti Shelter for lunch. Took off my shoes and relaxed for a while. It started raining...at least I was in a shelter. I put on my rain gear and set off again, 14.5 miles to get here and 7.2 more to go. The rain also brought fog. There were supposed to be some nice views but I could not see far. The trail turned very rocky which just kills my feet. It was slow going due to the slippery rocks. My feet are getting a workout. I am glad that I am planning a zero day tomorrow. My right pinky toe is really giving me grief even with all I've done, I wonder what use it is anyway. Maybe if it is cut off I wouldn't miss it. Would it help? Would it cause other problem? Hmmm, things you think about on the trail!   Woods Hole Hostel is a 1/2 mile hike down a gravel road off trail. I finally arrived amid the fog and rain. Bunks are first come first serve and they had one available, YIPPEE!   I got in at 5:30pm, got my bunk, took a shower and got settled. I signed up for dinner(7 pm) and breakfast(8am). I ran into Crisscross, Sunray and Farmer there then I went to the main house to see if they needed any help cooking or setting up. Let me tell you about this hostel, the 1880's chestnut log cabin was acquired by Roy and Tillie Wood who opened the hostel in 1986. Roy passed away the following year and for 22 years Tillie continued driving up from Georgia each spring to operate the hostel and keep their vision alive. Her granddaughter and husband now operate the hostel, they moved up in 2009 after a big renovation. With emphasis on sustainable living through farming, organic gardening, yoga and massage therapy. I along with other hikers helped set things up while others helped with the cooking. There are some hikers that work for stay. Great place. Dinner was fantastic, started with sweet potato soup then lasagna with homemade bread, topped off with homemade ice cream. The company of the ~23 hikers was nice also. We lingered after our meal and helped to clean up. a Couple hikers helped with breakfast prep for tomorrow. Lights were out at 10 pm. The bunkhouse has 4 bunks and a common area down then up a ladder to 8 bunks. I stayed upstairs which was very comfy. Great ending to a long day.","Jenny Knob Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530850,"I slept pretty good last night. It was hot in my sleeping bag though. I was sweating in it but when I got out of it, I was cold. I need to switch out my winter bag for a lighter weather one. It's time for research. I got up around 6:30am. Most hikers were leaving the shelter today but I am taking a zero to relax, heal, and do some more gear research. I helped with breakfast...I did the eggs. Eggs, sausage, bread and the best French toast I have had. It was creme brûlée that was soaked overnight then baked. Yum! I had orange juice and hot tea also. I saw the hikers off then did some chores to help out then took a shower. I feel great!! I'm ready to hike but not yet??. Around noon I got some bread and a block of cheese for lunch. It tasted wonderful. I couldn't finish it but it will be eaten on the trail. Sitting in the living room I was able to check out lighter options for some of my gear. I think I will order some things, have them shipped home, and switch out when I go home at the beginning of June. My plan is to visit an outfitter at the next stop and check out sleeping bag options. Cold Snap, Diesel, Bombadil, Goldberry and Black Bear arrived and I took a walk around the property to check out the place.  I was sitting on the porch with Diesel after dinner. It was getting dark and the tree frogs were singing. What an amazing atmosphere. I could just sit there for hours. There have been quite a few times on this hike that I have had this feeling. It is just wonderful. The feeling is simliar to some of the places my wife and I have traveled to. We sit there sometimes enjoying our surroundings and we don't want it to end.","Woods Hole Hostel

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531106,"It stormed last nite right after going to bed around 10pm. It came down hard and it hailed too. I like the sound of rain...it's very relaxing. I got up at 6:45am. The rain had stopped but it was still overcast. After I packed up, I went to the main house for breakfast. Eggs, sausage, cheese grits, bread, cinnamon rolls, orange slices, orange juice and tea. What a great start to my day! The skies look like they are clearing although the forecast is for rain the next few days. I left my name and email with the hostel so they can contact me next year about working there for a couple of weeks. I think it would be a pretty cool experience. I said my goodbyes and got on the trail at 9:35am. I ran into Learning Curve a couple of miles in so we ended up walking together. I saw a Grouse walking next to me so we stopped and took pictures. When I started walking again something hit my legs from behind and I let out quite a scream. Of course it was a manly scream!! It was the same Grouse...that was weird and funny at same time. It finally went away and we continued on. Learning Curve is faster than me so I was walking alone again. I stopped at the top of a mountain with great views and had a snack. I love my snacks.
I met Tea Biscuit who is from Belgium. He got a visa so that he could hike the trail. He is faster also so I am hiking alone which I like. All that was the GOOD for today. Now the BAD! It was going to happen sooner or later...I tripped going downhill and went down hard. I stayed on the ground just to see what hurt the most. I scraped both knees, both hands, and my left wrist. I got my water and cleaned the injured areas. I got up, brushed myself off, and got going again. A few minutes later I saw that my right knee was bleeding so I stopped and got my first aid stuff out and cleaned with disinfectant. I applied a couple of bandaids and was good to go. I started going slower because I didn't want to trip again and it did hurt some. There were some nice views along the way then it started getting overcast. The wind picked up which at first felt good. I would say it had been in the high 60's for most the day. Then the UGLY happened. It got really dark and the wind picked up to gale force almost knocking me down. Branches were falling from the trees. Then it started raining. I put my back to a large tree and put my pack down to get my rain gear but it was very difficult due to the wind. All of a sudden it started hailing! Some hit me on the head but it didn't hurt that badly. I always thought it would really hurt if you were hit by hail. I lifted my rain jacket over my head to protect myself. It was a lot of hail, it was everywhere. The hail lasted about 10 minutes then the rain picked up then stopped. I finally got my gear on. I guess it was a quick storm. As I walked there was hail on the ground everywhere. The temperature dropped to the low 50's. Within an hour another storm came and, this time, with thunder and lightening. It started raining again really hard. The trail was like a creek in parts. I wasn't even trying to avoid the puddles anymore as I was all wet anyway. I finally made it to the Rice Field shelter which sleeps 7 but there must have been 12 packed in there and a couple other hikers standing under the cover of the roof waiting for a good time to pitch their tents. Crisscross and Sunray were there and Sunray said I had a bump above my eyebrow. Apparently I got bruised by hail and didn't know it. Crisscross had 2 lumps on his head. I pitched my tent in the drizzle and on top of hail. Crisscross and Sunray came over to help me. It's going to be a cold night. My fingers are numb so it must be in the low 40's now. The trail throws all kinds of things at you but we're still here!","Woods Hole Hostel

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531424,"Woke up at 6am and it was raining so I laid there a while then decided to cook breakfast in my vestibule. That is an area which is just outside my tent door that is covered. I had freeze dried biscuits & gravy and hot chocolate...I enjoyed that. I started packing my gear inside the tent to keep it from getting wet...or should I say wetter because just about everything got wet yesterday.The rain stopped eventually so I got out of my tent. All the hail had melted. When I walked over to shelter, everyone had a story about the hail storm. Some had already pitched their tents when the storm came. A couple of tents went rolling and the hail tore into a couple of others. Two or three hikers had to hike BACK to town to repair/replace their tents. I got my tent up trying to shake the water off the best I could and took off at 9:15am. The weather was overcast with temperatures about the low to mid 50's. It was very foggy the first couple of hours then the fog lifted and I could see some views. The path was okay but then turned rocky and muddy, everything was still wet. Which made it slippery. I passed some hikers and some passed me. I stopped for lunch when the sun came out so I laid out my tent on the rocks to dry. Once I got it mostly dry, I got going again. It started raining again so I put on my gear. During the whole hike you could tell there was a storm because of the leaves and branches everywhere. I stopped at Pine Swamp Shelter, and saw Bombadil who had passed me earlier. He was there with a couple of other hikers. I left after a snack and the path got worse with water. I crossed several streams that were overflowing and it took some thinking and planning on how to cross over them. I wonder if anyone fell into the streams today? I made a tough climb to Bailey Gap Shelter and to my surprise no one was there. I swept out the whole shelter and got situated. I hung my clothes to dry then Bombadil showed up. It's good to have company. We ate and talked then settled down. Bombadil charged my phone for me..that was great because the battery was low. I will dream about a dry hike tomorrow, maybe it will come true.","Rice Field Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531425,"I don't set an alarm to wake up, when I'm in my tent I just wake up whenever. When I'm in the shelter I usually wake when someone else is stirring. This morning Bombadil got up then I followed, another hiker arrived last nite around 10pm. He is southbound but he stayed in his sleeping bag. Bombadil left about 15 min before me but we eventually met up. It was a dreary morning...no sun and in the 40's and no rain. This is actually very good hiking weather. I got into some rocky places but made it ok. The sun started coming out around 10am an I arrived at Warspur Shelter for brunch. Tots was at the shelter. He had spent the night and is still here. He's from Connecticut and does not have to finish by any certain time. He is taking it easy. He started on February 29th, leap year day. It is a popular starting time for some hikers to start. Bombadil arrived...he is having a little trouble with his leg/calf probably because he did high miles yesterday. If the sun stays shining it will be a pretty day. The shelter is nice with some grassy camping areas. You can hear the rushing water from the creek. I am feeling pretty good. I think my toe problems have gone away for now. Just dealing with my slightly swollen right knee, but even that is better than yesterday. I went down to the creek to get water on my way out. It was very pretty and flowing fast. Of course the clouds rolled in again. 5.8 miles later I arrived at Laurel Creek Shelter, there was quite a hill to climb on the way here. 1,700ft elevation change in a 2.5 mile climb and it was rocky too. Of course the sun is still behind the cloud. It really wants to rain. As I left The Shelter there was Laurel Creek and it was flowing really good. I hiked on and came up on a couple of pastures with nice views. I then started to climb yet another mountain, crossed a creek then came up on the largest oak tree on the southern part of the AT, it's called the Keffer Oak and is 18' around. The largest is in the New York part of the trail called the Dover Oak. I kept on hiking up, up and up. The two hills were rough today, maybe it was me...tired! At the top I was rewarded with a great view by a power line. I went on a couple of miles further and arrived at Sarver Hollow Shelter, the only problem is that you have to hike 0.4 mile down hill off the trail, that means we have to hike up just to get to the trail in the morning. I had some Jamaican Jerk Chicken & Rice and a cup of hot tea for dinner. Got my food bag hung but only after the first branch broke on me. There are 6 of us in the shelter tonight, Bombadil, myself and 4 others. I may need to walk 23 miles tomorrow to a hostel. I miss calculated my food rations and do not have enough to last me to the next town. The hostel has a free shuttle to town. I sure hope that I can make it.

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531624,"I did not want to get up today. It was cold, gloomy, and raining. it rained last night. Sarver Shelter, although tough to get in and out of, is very nice. It has a big covered porch and the picnic table is under it. That is very nice for rainy days like today. 
Bombadil and I got going a little after 7am. The other guys were just getting up but they will pass us...they are young and tall and fast. I got up ahead and hiked in the rain by myself. I was on a ridge for quite a while and it was very rocky so it made my hike slow. If it was not foggy and raining, I could tell that the sites would have been nice from both sides. I came up on the Eastern Continental Divide. I did not know that one existed. That was pretty cool! I arrived at Niday shelter and had brunch. Bombadil arrived and had broken one of his hiking poles on the rocks. For us older hikers poles are a must. Hikers really put a lot of abuse on the poles especially going downhill, it saves the knees! I am using Leki brand poles which my son Matthew gave me for Christmas. They are fantastic and have put up with a lot and are still going strong. Bombadil also shared some snacks with me which will help since I am short of food. Another hiker offered and said if we are at the same shelter tonight he will give me dinner since he has more than he needs. It is a good atmosphere on the trail. We take care of each other and help where we can. They call it Tramily (Trail Family). 

Since the rain had not stopped, it was cold, and my fingers were numb, I was determined to hike 22 miles to 4 Pines Shelter for some warmth. I still feel good and got going after snack time, 10:15 am. I came across some footbridges over fast running creeks. Everything is wet and the creeks are overflowing but it makes for nice views of the creeks. I climbed up Bush Mountain and came up on Audie Murphy Monument which was pretty cool. I thought everyone knew who Audie Murphy was but since my wife did not... he was a war hero, movie star, and I believe he owned the Oakland A's baseball team. Please correct me if I am wrong. Please look him up as he was an amazing person. I took out my phone to take a picture and it would not work. I tried everything but it was stuck on one screen and I could not do anything. Maybe it was the moisture...maybe it is getting waterlogged like me! I had the bright idea to put it in my last freeze dried food bag since rice was not handy. I made it down off the mountain and came across the side trail to Pickle Branch Shelter. I was tired and decided to keep going instead of veering off. I tried my phone again and it was still messed up so it was time to change my plan. Instead of staying at the shelter, I would get the shuttle to take me into town. My plan was to stay at a hotel and get my phone fixed, replace my Sawyer filter and check out gear options.
I had heard that the next climb, Cove Mountain with Dragons Tooth (Stone Monolith) was a very technical area, which means steep and rocks. I made it up and it did not seem too bad. I even took the side trail to see the Dragons Tooth. I could see sights from up there since the fog had lifted just enough, but it was not really clear. Well the hike this morning over the rocks was definitely harder than this one. I started going down and WOW! This is what they were talking about, it was steep and had many flat rocks making it very difficult to traverse. Add in the rain and you have an accident waiting to happen. It was very slow going and I really had to stop a few times to plan my steps. That lasted about a mile and I bet it took me an hour. My right knee was really feeling it. I am now officially drained and tired. I made it to the road and hiked 0.3 miles to 4 Pines Shelter which is a converted large 3 car garage. This is pretty cool and roomy. There were about 20 hikers there. I met up with Monster, Sweet Pea, Oriole, Juan Durer, Maria, Cherokee, Medicine Man and his dog Scout, Farmer and some new faces. I talked to the owner and he said it would be a while for the shuttle to come back. I made myself at home and caught up with all the hikers I knew. I finally made it to town, booked myself into the Howard Johnson and walked to get something to eat. My phone was still on the blink! I used the hotel desktop to send my wife an email to let her know what happened to the phone, then went to the room. All of sudden my phone rang, it was my wife, it was good to hear her voice. We caught up for a while then I took a shower and laid down. Although it was a very tough day, I did get to see the Eastern Continental Divide, Audie Murphy Monument, cool streams, nice shelters, Dragons Tooth, and many familiar hikers at the 4 Pines. I can feel that my legs and feet need some rest. I hope to get things fixed tomorrow.","Sarver Hollow Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531788,"I got up and had the free breakfast at the hotel. It wasn't great but it was free! I had to take care of my damaged phone so I walked to the Verizon store which was right next to the Outfitter, which was next to a Chinese Buffet, which was next to Kroger. Great, I can do a lot of things here! At Verizon they got my phone to partially work. The home button does not work so they created a floating home button. The phone still does not react well at all and it takes too long to do anything. They needed my wifes social to get into the account to see what plan I had. I sent Yvonne a text for the info. While I was waiting I went to the outfitter and looked at their sleeping bags, pads and rain gear. I bought a new water filter, the Sawyer larger size. This should definitely help me out. I went to eat at the buffet then went shopping at Kroger. I have lost soooooo much weight as well as some muscle mass on my upper body. I started at 182 lbs and am down to 155 lbs. While shopping I really paid attention to high calorie and high protein items. I realized that my food intake will have to increase. I took quite a while shopping then I went back to the hotel and unloaded. Yvonne got back with me with the info so I went back to Verizon. They got into our account and realized they needed the password. So I sent another text to Yvonne and walked back to the hotel. While I was waiting to hear back from her, I went through my gear, packed my back pack with everything except food and water and when I got Yvonne's response I headed back to Verizon with my backpack. My first stop was at the outfitter where I weighed my pack. It was 25 lbs so I still need to get it lower. I went to Verizon and they did not have a plan to replace my phone. They said I would have to go to a third party to fix my phone as they do not fix phones. The third party is in another town!! He also told me my storage is full and that is why my phone is messing up. I did not believe him but I left there determined to delete pictures and other things to open more storage space and see what happens. I went back to the outfitter and found Bombadil and Goldberry there. I'm sure he replaced his broken pole. I checked out the sleeping bags and bought a 45 degree Big Agnes bag that will save me 1 lb 2 oz. I also bought a new rain top which is half the weight and feels better. My rain top is a Marmot Minimalist. I is an excellent top but I sweat sooooo much under it. Although it keeps the rain out I am dripping wet with sweat underneath. My new top is an Outdoor Research Helium II. I also ran into Maria. She was picking up a resupply box and waiting for her ride. She walked the 25 miles from 4 Pines Hostel today...she is quite a hiker. Maria is about 30 years old and she had a great job, an apartment in Atlanta and a nice car but sold everything and left her job to do the trail. Her father is from Canada and mother from Argentina, she was raised in both places and speaks Spanish very well. Maria may go back to the same job or do something else...she will figure it out. She also plans to do more traveling when she finishes the trail. She will figure it all out and, now, she has time to think about it. I learned about quilts from her. Its funny that I am learning so much about hiking related things from everyone I come in contact with and most are half my age. On the way back to the hotel I ran into Stone. He actually lives 15 miles from Daleville and was about to have a followup interview with a local TV station. They did a spot on him before he started. That was pretty cool, I was hiking with a celebrity!! When I got back to the room and talked to my wife a bit and relaxed.  I walked back to the Kroger area to have dinner at Three Lil Pigs restaurant. I sat at the bar, ordered dinner, and a local dark ale and started deleting pictures and videos. I had preserved lots of great memories. They are on my computer at home so all is not lost! I had spinach and sausage soup to start, pulled pork and ribs with hush puppies and black eyed peas for dinner and...free banana pudding for dessert since I was a thru hiker. I was full! I walked back to the hotel and all the deletions did not seem to help my phone. I got to sleep pretty late after watching Ironman III.","VA 624, Newport Rd

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531818,"I had another good morning. I ran into Stitch at breakfast and she invited me to join her group. I met Secret Agent who is from Massachusetts and got his name because he was not signing the logs at the shelters. When they asked him why he said he was on a mission and did not want anybody to know who or where he was. Thus...Secret Agent. I also met Garfield. He got his name because he eats a lot. I saw Maggie who I had met before but her name is now Rubix because she carries a Rubix cube with her and tries to solve it faster and faster. She was sitting with Fisherman. He is from Switzerland and was happy to learn I was hiking with Crisscross and Sunray a few days earlier and let him know they should be in town today. That group, including Bevo, have been 1/2 to 1 day ahead of me for a week. I went back to the room and got my gear that I was going to mail home. I am now about 3 lbs lighter. I walked over to Verizon first and told them that I did what they asked me to do and my phone is still the same. There was a different guy there and he took over my problem and suggested I back everything up to the Cloud then he would try something to see if it would work. It took a while to finally get it going to back up and then the back up would take a couple of hours. I went for lunch at Bojangles. Then went to the outfitter to make a couple of small purchases. While I was there Secret Agent introduced me to Bevo and sure enough he did attend the University of Texas and lives in Austin. Bevo is the mascot name for UT. A good story about that...years ago Texas A&M beat Texas in football 13-0 and some Aggies stole the mascot longhorn from Austin and branded 13-0 on it. When Texas got it back they rebranded to fix that and it spelled Bevo, thus the name. We Aggies are soooooo clever! We had a nice visit and will surely meet up again. I then went to the UPS store and mailed off my stuff and checked in on my phone...it was still uploading. I wanted to accomplish something with the time I had so I walked back to the hotel to get on the computer. I met two ladies from Germany who were just getting in from the trail, Claudia and Gabby. They are sisters and hiking for 10 days. There are a lot of Germans on the trail.  I made plans with a shuttle to take me to where I got off the trail and I will slack pack 25 miles back to town for tomorrow.  Back to my problem...I headed back to the Verizon store...it did not work, they gave me a couple of options and they were both expensive. Talked to my stepson Vincent about the problem and what they were suggesting, then I talked to my wife (she usually makes the technology decisions). I think I will need to buy a new phone, not an Iphone but a refurbished Samsung I think, not as pricey. I will decide tomorrow. I bought coffee for the verizon staff since they really tried to help. Sat in the Coffee house next door with a few hikers for a while. Came back to hotel and took a shower and got my pack ready for tomorrows hiking. I will still carry my pack but without a lot of stuff. When I went to the lobby I ran into 2 of the three ladies I had met a couple weeks ago, Fay and Mary, talked to them for a while and they let me know that Siva had gotten off the trail already and headed home. It was good to catch up with them.My next stop was to go to eat and I chose the Three Lil Pigs again. Claudia and Gabby were there so I sat with them. I learned that they are both married to Frenchmen, they also take a sisters only vacation every two years and this is it. Claudia explained why they got so popular right away. The day they were getting on the trail they bought fruit and guacamole and alot of extra stuff that once hiking they realized it was not a good idea...their packs were too heavy. At the shelter they stayed at they shared all their food snacks with everybody just to get rid of it. They were good company during dinner. When finished they went shopping at Kroger and said they were getting wine and would knock on my door when they got back if I wanted to have a drink with them. When I got back to the room I was able to talk to Yvonne for a while discussing my phone issues and how her day went. Claudia and Gabby got back and I joined them outside on the balcony along with Highlander and Nomad, two southern Florida hikers. Ralphie showed up and came over to talk to us for a while. Had a nice time hanging out with them. The ladies got my blog info and my email to keep in touch.","VA 624, Newport Rd

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532063,"I had an early breakfast at 6:30am and got picked up at 6:50am to go to the start of my hike. Started hiking at 7:15am and felt really good. The weather was overcast and it was in the mid 60's. There are supposed to be nice views from the top of the mountains and ridges I will be climbing today. After 6 miles I crossed a road and saw Highlander and Nomad just starting. I hiked 10 miles to McAfee Knob in less that 4 hours. I saw Black Bear up there and we took some pics together. I also met Shoe...we had passed each other a couple of times getting up there. Shoe and I hiked together off and on the rest of the way. The next nice views were at the Tinker Cliffs which was a great hike, we actually hiked for 1/2 mile on the cliffs and the views were spectacular. Shoe and I took pictures. We hiked to passed a couple of shelters and I stopped at Lamberts Shelter to eat something and rest a bit. Magellan and Doc were there and we missed seeing a bear by just 30 minutes!! Darn, I missed another chance to see a bear. The whole days hike will be over 25 miles and I started getting tired at 20. I passed Hong Kong Steve and chatted with him a bit then I saw his hiking partners, Freight Train and Sparky. Visited with 3 hikers resting on the side of the trail, they were Sneaky Pete, Hailey and McGyver. It remained clear the whole day. It was a bit cloudy and it did threaten to rain a few times but it never did. I arrived in Daleville at 5:50pm, the second half was definitely slower than the first. When I got to the room I hand washed the clothes I was in and took a shower. I walked to dinner with China(who is now Aurora) and Conundrum. It is good to see them again and catch up with what has happened during the past week. Sitting next to us on one side was Freight Train, Hong Kong Steve(Wow, he can eat) and Sparky. We had a chat with them after dinner. Several other hikers were there as well. We walked back to the hotel and I got on the lobby computer to update my blog...I was tired. I will be calling the Verizon number tomorrow to see what they can do for me.","VA 624, Newport Rd

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532118,"First I want to apologize on the untimeliness of the blog. Since I have phone problems it has been a chore to upload the blog...especially the pictures. I had an okay nights sleep. It's funny that I get more rest when I am hiking than when I am in town and at a Hotel. Well, I got my gear together and went for breakfast. I called Verizon and they said I had a warranty until June...that is not what the Verizon store told me. The store was definitely trying to sell me something...anything! They are going to ship a new phone to me but I won't get it for another 4 days or so. Thanks Yvonne for the suggestion that Verizon's call center may offer better service. My plan was to hike only 11 miles today. Although I reduced weight on my gear, my bag is heavy due to lots of food. I will be eating well for the next few days. OK, maybe not well but I will have a lot of calories and proteins. I hope that I can take pictures and put on blog. Looks like noon for me to get on the trail. Chena(now Aurora)and Conundrum left about 11am, I saw Crisscross, Sunray, Champa and Get Weird as I went for lunch, looks like we are all heading to the same shelter. Had a good meatloaf sandwich and took off. It was a nice hike coming up on a meadow to begin with then crossed a few roads. I am writing this on Friday from memory so it will be short. Arrived at Wilson Creek Shelter around 4:30pm, my regular hiking friends were there. More hikers came in as time went by, I finally met Food Bag, she is an Aggie and is from Houston, we had heard of each other but this is the first time we met up. Also met Mouse, Bug Stick, Spiderman, Ozark and Mismatch(from Wales). We had a good time at the shelter, good group. I made Ramen, spicy tuna, peanut butter and instant mashed potatoes mixed together, it was sooo good. realized that I did not have my spork(combination spoon and fork) so I had to find a branch to eat with, will take a picture of it later so you can see. Ozark was just doing small miles and going South, He had a lot to say and it was his birthday tomorrow so I gave him a food present, he was happy. Once we got settled and sleeping, there were only 3 of us in the shelter everyone else camped, Mouse came over, it was 9:30pm. Something had taken one of her food bags and she was a little scared. I told her to bring her sleeping bag and stay in the shelter with us. She did that and now had to hang her bag, she did not want to go out there alone. I went with her to hang it with mine, it was too much weight for the branch to hold and it came crashing down, I started laughing but Mouse did not, she had had enough this night. We found another tree and got them up. It was a tough night for Mouse.","US 220, Daleville, VA

Most of us were going to push 20 miles and stay at Bryant Ridge Shelter which holds 20 hikers. It is one of the biggest and nicest we hear. It was very misty and wet again. It is like we're hiking in the clouds. That's what we see around us, above and below. Today we crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway a few times. If you have not had the experience of driving the Blue Ridge Parkway it is a definite must. The views are fantastic! I drove a part of it a couple of years ago with my kids on the way back from Ashville NC. When we got to the road, the views were definitely something to look at. We were above the clouds but the mountain peaks in the distance shot out. It is like looking at a sea of clouds below you. We got to see a few of these sites at Harveys Knob Overlook, Otter Overlook, Mills Gap Overlook and Cove Mountain. As time went by the clouds came up and it was very damp then we were below them and the sun started peaking out. I arrived at Cross Jennings Creek after 16 miles and decided to take a dip in the cold water. Aurora(China), Conundrum, Oriole, Sweet Potato, Juan Durer and I got in. It felt really good and refreshing, we stayed about 30 minutes and then continued our hike. Oriole, Sweet Potato and Juan D decided to camp there for the night. Bryant Ridge Shelter was definitely a nice shelter. Gabby and Claudia were there. It was nice to reunite with them again although it would be for only one night. The shelter sleeps 20 and we had 13 there by the end of the night. It was 2 story and really clean and new. I started raining again at night but I had an excellent night's sleep. With 13 there we only had one snorer and it was not that loud. Great!","Wilson Creek Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532768,"It rained until about 6am. It seems like we have been in a rain forest for a few days. The terrain is very thick and lush and, of course, wet and humid.The hike today started going from 1277 ft elevation to 3560 ft elevation in 4 miles. It was tough to start the day with that. My phone problems persist but that is a long story. I am barely able to make posts and take a few photos but I am managing. I reached Black Rock overlook and by then the clouds had lifted to give us some great views. The hike had many up and downs. Although they were not very long distances, it just seemed tiring. Another highlight of the day was walking under Guillotine Rock. The trail went through a rock formation with a boulder on top just waiting to catch a hiker coming through to fall on top of them! Our destination was not a shelter but a camping area by a spring called Harrison Ground Spring. About 2 miles from the Guillotine Rock the clouds rolled in and it started thundering and lightning. It did not start raining until 15 minutes before I arrived at the site. I set up my tent in the driving rain and realized that was a big mistake. I spent the next 30 minutes wiping up water from the base of my tent, it was like a bathtub in there. Aurora and Conundrum were already set up, Crisscross, Sunray, Get Weird and Champa arrived as the rain let up and I was still drying. They decided to move on to the next shelter. I had to take my tent apart and set up in a different spot. I finally got it to the point where I could set my sleeping bag up. I cooked in my vestibule because I was cold. Oriole and Juan Durer arrived shortly after. I was finally laying down when I heard more hikers come in. Sweet Potato, Shaggy and another hiker arrived in the dark and set up. It rained some more through the evening but I stayed relatively dry. I am looking forward to some good rest. I am tired.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532915,"I packed up my wet gear the best I could. Hopefully the sun will come out later and I can lay out my tent to dry. Of course with everything wet that adds weight to my load...not good. We will try for Punchbowl Shelter today, 18 miles. It turned out to be a nice hiking day, foggy and damp just like the other mornings and then it started clearing up. There wasn't a lot of sun but it was clear. I came up to Matts Creek Shelter then Matts trail. That made me think of my son Matt then all of the kids. I really do miss them. I will be leaving the trail in early June to go to my Class reunion and of course I get to see my wife, grandson, and family. Hopefully my son Matt can come into town so I can spend time with him before heading back to the trail. My wife and I usually take all of our kids on a family vacation once a year. I am not sure it will happen this year but those are fun times. Wish they could all come up and hike with me for a couple of days. Since there has been a lot of rain, the creeks are swollen and running very nicely. Hiking by and next to these creeks is very enjoyable. Today I hiked by a flowing creek with loud little falls and cascades then it went off into what I though was a lake in the distance, the trail got a bit closer and realized it was James River. I came across a Ridge Runner and spoke with him for a while. Ridge Runners have an AT uniform and are volunteers who oversee certain sections of the trail. As I moved on I crossed over the longest footbridge on the AT. It crossed over the James River. From there the trail went up and I was over the clouds again at Big Rocky Row View. I took a picture of a rock and tree and I could see nothing but clouds beyond. All through the hikes since Daleville the plants have been blooming more and more which makes for colorful foliage. Different kinds of flowers seem to be popping up each day. I went down then back up to Bluff Mountain where there looks to be a gigantic golf ball teed up but it is an FAA tower. I knew that the shelter was close.  I reached Punchbowl Shelter at 5pm, Crisscross and Sunray were in the shelter already. Aurora, Conumdrum, Oriole, Juan Durer, Sweet Potato, Farmer, Aristotle and another 72 year old section hiker named George camped. We were joined in the shelter with a mother-daughter team section hiking, and two ladies from Florida who were also section hiking. One of the Florida ladies was also 72 years old and had done several section hikes. She wanted to do the whole thing but her family would not let her, they did not even want her to do sections but she is doing well. We had a lot of conversation that night. I spoke to the mother who said that they are on a 5 week section hike. This is the second year they have done this. Her daughter is challenged and has anxiety attacks and is 14 years old. The mom says when she gets on the trail the anxiety problems do not occur...the trail is very therapeutic. This is the second mom I have met on the trail who brings her ""challenged"" child out for section hiking and I just applaud what they do. Parents in general go above and beyond what they ever thought they could do just for their children but, having a challenged child, it is just extraordinary what some parents do.  I had dinner using my stick fork. I finished and cleaned up then when I got my tooth brush out guess what I found...MY REAL SPORK!!! I have been eating for 3 nights with a stick!! We all had a good laugh about that. I laid down just before dark and could hear Juan D playing the ukulele so I got up and walked over. Aristotle had made a fire and Conundrum, Farmer and Oriole were sitting around it talking I joined them as did the 72 year old lady, George and Crisscross. Good conversation, good company and good setting with the music in the background. Another wonderful night on the trail.

My goal is to do 11 plus miles to US 60 and catch a ride to Buena Vista where I could get my phone at the post office and then a zero the next day to get my new phone going. I would be sharing a ride with Aurora and Conundrum. I was 25 minutes into my hike when I realized I was going the wrong way!! I hiked back and really started going quickly to catch up to everyone, they thought I was in front of them. I made good time but was a little upset that I could not spend more time enjoying the surroundings with lots of creeks and pretty flowers. I was on a mission to catch up. it was very wet and muddy on parts of the trail. The last 4 miles were mostly along a nice creek with some falls and cascades. Although overcast, it was very pretty. If I had more time I would have stopped and maybe gotten in one of the pools or just sat there by a fall and relaxed. I finally reached the road and they were all there still waiting for a ride. I got there in time, but was very tired because I had not stopped for a break. There were six of us but the driver could only take 3 at a time. Aurora, Conundrum and I went first and got dropped off at a BBQ place since we were all hungry. I had a good meal and officially bought Aurora's back pack from her. If you remember from an earlier posting I mailed my bag home and began using hers since she got a new one. It is 2 lbs lighter and a little smaller. It took a while to get used to it but it is fitting well now. Aurora's mom and sisters were coming into town to visit with them so I may not see them for a few days.  I walked to the Post Office only to find out that my new phone was not there. I will have to check with Verizon. I went to the library after that to check on the hours they are open then to the washateria to wash my clothes. Once I got the clothes washing, I made my way to the campgrounds and checked in and set up my tent. It is about a mile walk to the washateria from the campsite which is nothing to me these days. By the time I got back to the washateria, Aurora and Conundrum had gotten picked up by their family before I got there. Sweet Potato, Juan Durer, and Oriole were washing also; they had already set up there tents. It was now time to call Verizon. You would never believe what I found out... they never sent the phone and they don't know why!! After about 30 minutes on the phone they said they would overnight it to me. It is very, very, frustrating dealing with Verizon. They seem to be very nice and helpful but it seems you have to be in the office with them to help them follow through. At least I don't have to wait until Monday. I went to Library and spent about 20 minutes online before they closed. I went back to the campground and took a shower and for the first time in 5 days put on clean dry clothes...wonderful! Oriole, Juan D and I went to a Mexican restaurant for dinner and had Margaritas. Dinner was very good and the Margaritas were even better. We walked back and sat around our tents talking. I got in my tent about 11pm and saw I had a text from Yvonne. Verizon did not ship my phone to Buena Vista Post Office like I instructed but to my home in Texas. So I am on the phone with Verizon again and this time I am not the nice calm El Tejano! It is unbelievable the continuing incompetence of such a big company like Verizon. After all the talking and checking, Verizon does not know how that happened. They can see the address it was supposed to go to but somehow it went somewhere else! I will not get my phone now until Monday! I need another Texas sized Margarita!!!!","Punchbowl Shelter

I got ham, sausage, bacon, two eggs, biscuits and gravy. I ordered the same plate again minus the gravy. Great breakfast for a small price. Sweet Potato and I lingered there for a while waiting for the Library to open. I thought I would go and check for my package at the post office just in case. No package. I went to the library and caught up on my blog. After the Library closed at 1pm, we met Oriole and Juan D at the Amish Cupboard, an Amish deli, grocery, bakery store. It was wonderful. I was in heaven. I had a deli sandwich and coconut turnover, it was delicious. Juan D, and Sweet Potato split a tub of ice cream. We then walked over to the Mexican restaurant since it started raining. We sat there until the rain stopped then headed back to the campsite. We hitchhiked and got picked up by a nice couple in a pickup truck. They sure saved us a lot of walking. I got to my tent just in time when a storm blew in. It was very windy with driving rain. It only lasted about 15 minutes and our tents made it ok. We just hung out and Oriole and I walked to a different BBQ place and had dinner and a couple of beers at the bar. While I was at the bar I decided to call Verizon just to check on my phone location. They said they had diverted it from Baytown but it was not going to get here until 3 days from now, Tuesday! I told them to send it to the next town, Waynesboro, I should be there in 4 days. I gave them the complete address to send it to. Now, this call lasted the whole time I was at dinner which kind of spoiled it. Ok, no phone in Buena Vista, so I will leave tomorrow with the group and head to Waynesboro.

All of us but Sweet Potato decided to walk back and head out. Sweet Potato decided to go to a church service then catch up to us. We got a taxi and started hiking at noon. We took off and of course Oriole soon left us behind. Oriole has a fast pace that is hard to keep up with but when he gets into the next gear, forget it! He is gone. I passed the mother and daughter that stayed at the same shelter a few days ago. I chatted with them a bit then went on my way. I decided to call Verizon just to check on my phone and guess what, it was being shipped to my home town again!!!!! It should not surprise me but I asked for a supervisor and let her know what I had been through so far and I did not understand how they could fail to get me the phone so many times. She was no help. She only made excuses. After 30 minutes of getting nowhere I told her to just let it go to my home and I will get someone to mail it to me since they cannot do it! I am really condensing what was said. OK, now I just have to get it overnighted to Waynesboro and it will be done. I will try to forget about them for a couple of days. With it being a Sunday and a cool clear day there were many day hikers out. I crossed paths with Sparky, Freight Train and Hong Kong Steve, who were slack packing. I think they slack pack 80% of the time...they are fun to talk to. We were rewarded with some really great views throughout the hike. I also met Missing Person, a section hiker heading our direction. We arrived at our destination, Piney River North Fork, which is not a river but creek. Oriole was already there. Juan and I set up our tents. It was pretty cool by then, probably mid 40's. This campsite was very eerie looking, like something out of a Walt Disney witch movie. The trees were growing on the boulders and you could see the roots holding on like you would wrap your hand around a baseball. There was a lot of green moss and it was damp. We made a fire when Sweet Potato arrived. We were kidding that she probably met some church members and they took her to a bbq! We were not far off...they had a potluck after service so she had a feast. The minister and his wife even took her back to get her tent and drove her out to the trailhead. It was a good day for Sweet Potato! Juan Durer is working for a pod cast group, ""Sounds of the Trail"" He is interviewing hikers on the trail about different topics. He interviewed Oriole, Sweet Potato and myself. We may be on the podcast. Our fire was going good when Black Santa, Savage and Shaggy(now McDoubles) arrived, they got behind us because they went to Trail Days in Demascus. Apparently it was worth the trip they got a lot of freebies like new packs and gear. Crisscross and Sunray were trying to get a ride to Trail Days. I hope they made it and had fun. I made Ramen, peanut butter, mashed potatoes and peanuts for dinner...yes all together and it is good.

The whole day was partly cloudy but clear, and we were rewarded again with fantastic views. The first was Spy Rock, a side trail to get to it. I saw 3 packs on the ground so I dropped mine and walked the side trail, Oriole who had passed me earlier was coming back and said it was well worth the climb. You had to actually do some climbing to get to the top of the rock cropping. I climbed up, Savage and McDoubles were there, we took some pictures and it was definitely on my top five as far as views, 360 degree and clear. We made our way down and continued on. I climbed to the top of the Priest Mountain, 4063 ft., then the long descent, 3093 ft. in 3 miles. Now we had to climb Three Ridges Mountain, 3959 ft. in 6 miles. Again the views are incredible. I ran into Sparky and Freight Train. No, they were not slack packing.

To me there is nothing worse than packing up gear in the rain. There was a Bear Pole there. This is the first I had seen one. It is like a Maypole with many hooks on top. You hook your food bag to a long rod they place your bag on top hanging from a hook. It was funny to watch people doing this cause the rod was barely long enough and if your were short, you probably couldn't do it. The night was cool but not as cold as last night.

I got to Rockfish Gap and there were a list of residents who you could call and they would pick you up and take you where you want to go for free! Waynesboro is very hiker friendly and about 4 miles off the trail. We had decided to go to Grace Lutheran Hiker Hostel, they are only open for a month and had opened for the season yesterday, great timing. The first number we called, Steve, he was available and came to get us, we squeezed in another hiker, Mary. We got to to church and Farmer was there. He said there were only 4 hikers last night. We checked in and got a tour. They have quite an operation. We slept in an auditorium type area with portable cots that we set up. They had showers, kitchen, common room and loaner day packs and clothes. We set up and I took a shower. I feel so much better! I went to dinner, Chinese Buffet! Oriole, Juan, Rubix, Fisherman and I sat together. Saw Bombadil and Goldenberry there. I had a chat with them and they are doing well. I had a good meal and did not overdo it. As we were leaving I saw Shoe outside and talked to him for a bit. When we got back to the Church, Maria was there too. There were 14 hikers there including Andy, Mary, Rafiki (had not seen him in a while), Missing Person, Aristotle, and a couple more. I had a nice evening in the common room chatting with the two patrons. I had some hot chocolate and toast with jelly for a late snack while some of us hung out in the common room where there were a couple of computers that we could use.I got on to check on the routing for my phone and saw it was not going to Waynesboro but to Buena Vista where I was 4 days ago!! That was the original destination from 6 phone calls ago and how it is ending up there who knows. Since my phone is completely out now I asked my wife to correct it. Well she got a taste of Verizon ""Customer Service"" and she said the best thing for me to do is rent a car and drive to Buena Vista on Thursday to get it. What a Saga!

If not, then I will come back to the hostel. I offered anybody a ride who needed it once I get the car. I left and got my car. It was a Fiat...a very small car. When I got back to the hostel Rafiki, Aristotle and the section hiker needed rides. It was funny squeezing everybody in the car, Rafiki and Aristotle are both over 6ft tall but we did it. I dropped off Rafiki in town, took Aristotle to the outfitter and the Section hiker went with me to Buena Vista since he was getting picked up to get back to his car, this would save him $40. He was very appreciative. I got to Buena Vista and went to the Post Office but my UPS had not arrived yet. They said it would be soon so I went to the library where I am writing my blog.UPS came but they did not drop my package off!! It was about 11:00am by then. Here I go on the phone again, this time with UPS. They said he should have had it and they took my number and they tried to contact the driver.  In the meantime I took advantage of my time and went to Historic Lexington which was only 7 miles away. Virginia Military Institute and another college are there. They have a nice historic downtown. I had lunch at a popular restaurant. The lamb meatballs were excellent! Finally the UPS driver called me and apologized because he still had the package but he would drop it off at the post office in 10 minutes. I got back to Buena Vista and GOT IT!!!! Everyone at the post office was out talking to me and having a good laugh, but they were very helpful and happy for me. I headed out of town back to Waynesboro and to the Verizon store where they synced my new phone. It did not take them long and they boxed the old one for me and I was gone again looking for a UPS mail center which I found further into town. Done! The phone saga is over, I hope! While I was in Buena Vista I decided to mail my cooking stove and pot home as an experiment of not cooking. Since I will be home in 2 weeks for a function I can bring it back if I miss it. This will also save my pack some weight. Of course I will have to resupply differently and really think of what I will be eating. I went to the outfitter and weighed my pack without food and water...18lbs 10oz... that is fantastic! I will stay at the hostel again tonight and get back to hiking in the morning. I cant wait.I went to the grocery store and got my food supplies...a large summer sausage, a lot of cheese(mozzarella and cheddar), olives and bagels. Thought I would try bagels instead of flat bread this time. Bagels are bulkier and heavier but are full of calories. While heading back to the car rental agency I saw Sea Biscuit(from Wales) walking on the side of the road. I picked him up and took him to the grocery store. He told me that was it for him, his heart was not in it anymore. He said he would like to come back and finish sometime in the future.I returned the car and got a ride back to the hostel. On Thursdays our hosts cook a meal for the hikers. We had vegetarian ziti, meatballs on the side, salad, garlic bread, cookies and ice cream. I am stuffed. There were only 6 hikers Rafiki, Ish(from Israel), Skebo, Nums and Mega Fauna(whom I met in Damascus but they had different names, Jeff(a flipflopper) and Karl(a biker doing the transamerica trail, which is coast to coast) and about 7 other people. Dinner was excellent and we got to talk to everybody, hikers and non hikers. I helped clean up later. Thanks to Irma, Marge and Moonwalker for cooking everything. I have a new phone and a big smile on my face. I am ready to hike and reach Harpers Ferry before I get off the trail.","Rockfish Gap, Waynesboro

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534440,"I had a good breakfast before heading out today. Moonwalker gave me a ride to the trailhead on her way home. I started hiking at 9am. It was a beautiful day...the sun was out and it was 57 degrees. I saw Get Weird and Champ at the popcorn stand. I waved to them but not sure if they knew who I was from that distance. I self registered to hike in the park a little ways in the trail. You have to carry the registration on your bag all through the park. I saw a few day hikers out. There were not many views because of the trees but the trail was pretty. There were many up and downs today but they were not too long. I almost stepped on a snake on the trail. It really startled me. It was black and about 4 ft long. I'm sure it was a good snake. As I got closer to take a picture it started rattling its tail. You couldn't see a rattle but it did it anyway. I kept my distance then. A learning moment...look where you're stepping! I went on my way and ran into Freight Train and Sparky slack packing again. I see them almost every day now, we always stop and talk. There is a lot of vegetation. Everything is green now and growing into the trail. Flowers are everywhere which makes for pretty trails. I kept hiking looking down to see where I am stepping and I look up to see a bear looking at me about 30 yds in front of me! I didn't get scared. I was excited!! My first bear on the trail and there he was! I got my camera out but he took off into the woods. I eased my way up the trail looking for him with my camera ready, Nothing. Walking slowly I started getting worried, he went in all this vegetation and I can't even hear him. He may be there looking at me! About 3 minutes pass and I look down the trail and there he is again. I got a quick pic before he turned and ran down the trail and another picture as he ran. I got a dot on my photo.  Very cool to see a bear. This was a learning moment...look down the trail as you never know what may be there. Also, look left and right as you never know what may be looking at you!   Now I'm hiking with my head on a swivel! LOL! The rest of the hike was not as exciting. I reached Blackrock Shelter about 6pm. It was a good 20 mile hike. My legs were tired. Aurora and Conundrum were there along with Stix from Australia hiking south, Midwest Momma a section hiker heading south and a couple of other section hikers. Stuart came in at 7pm, he is from England and through hiking north also. He was very funny. Everyone was cooking and eating dinner. Since I sent my stove home, I had summer sausage and cheese on a bagel, peanut butter crackers and a honeybun. I could get used to this not cooking. It was in the low 50's. We were all talkative but by nightfall we were all tucked in.","Rockfish Gap, Waynesboro

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534475,"We all woke up late, about 8am. It had rained all night but it was only drizzling now. I left about 9:15am. My plan is to go to the next shelter, about 13 miles. There were no views because it was drizzling and foggy. I walked by Blackrock Ridge but could not see much. It looked like there was a rock slide...all the rocks are black. I could not see it all because of the mist. I hiked on and crossed a few roads. In the Shenandoahs we cross the roads many times. There is a restaurant 1/2 mile off the trail which I am aiming to get to. When I got there I saw Aurora and Conundrum who were enjoying a milk shake. I got a burger, cheese fries, chips and Pepsi. I stayed a while writing my blog and charging my phone then I ordered a milkshake. I am full now. 5 more miles to the shelter and it is still very foggy and there is light rain.We headed out in the drizzle. I was glad for the three hour break. I can imagine how pretty the trail would be with no fog! The past two days I have started out feeling rested then a couples hours in, I feel so drained. My legs are so tired. I don't mind hiking in the rain but consecutive days of wet makes it difficult to keep things dry, especially if you pitch your tent. That is why it is nice to arrive early to the shelter to get a spot which I just did today. I got one of the last spots. I got to Pinefield Hut at 5:30pm. Crisscross and Sunray arrived after a 27 mile day. It was great to see them again. There was 11 of us in the hut and 3 tents outside. I met a few section hikers and had good conversations. There were 3 girls from Madison Wisconsin, just out of college. One of them found a tick on the back of her neck and took it off with tweezers. It was funny to see everybody feeling the back of their necks. We all got a good laugh about that. Most hikers are having trouble with foot pain. When your feet stay wet they seem to feel raw. Mine are definitely hurting. It is still cold. It is probably in the mid 40's...that's my guess. Everyone settled in by 8:30 trying to keep warm.","Black Rock Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534698,"I got up a little later than Crisscross who is always up first. It rained all night long. My breakfast now consists of 2 breakfast bars, peanut butter crackers and peanuts. After breakfast, I took 2 ibuprofen to see if it would help my feet/legs and got going around 7:30am. Although it seems like I am hiking with the same people, I hardly see them on the trail. ""Hike your own hike"" really works. When you are alone, you tend to absorb your surroundings more...at least I do. As I have mentioned before, I have many random thoughts. Whenever I pass someone or they pass me, we usually stop and talk. It is nice to meet fellow hikers. Everyone has a different story. It is nice meeting up with others for lunch or at the end of the day. Today I am hiking alone and it is cold and rainy and muddy on the trail. The condition of the trail is the result of 2 days of constant rain and no sun. I am feeling good and am carrying a good pace. I got to see a little bitty mouse on the trail, an orange lizard and some deer. What is cool is they all posed for me! I passed Crisscross and Sunray. Crisscross's shoelace broke and he was trying to make the pieces work. As I trudged through the mud I thought of all the hikers who stop their quest because of days like this. The trail does test your will in many ways. Everything wet, feet hurting along with other parts of your body, hungry, tired of eating the same stuff, steep climbs and steep rocky downhills while your knees are screaming! Yes, many reasons to stop hiking. The trail itself is pretty. I would love to hike this on a nice day. There is something pretty cool when you see the trail disappear into the mist...eerie but cool. There were parts of the trail that looked like Indians would come out and attack me, or patriots or monsters! I guess I watch too many action movies! Random thoughts! Later in the afternoon I got to a park campground and went to the campstore. I got some hummus, chips and a Pepsi. My real purpose was to get warm because my fingers were so numb. I ran hot water over them in the bathroom. I spent about 30 min there! As I was leaving Stuart was arriving. I got to Bearfence mountain hut shortly after. It was a full house again once Stuart and McGoober got there. I just wanted to change clothes eat and get in my sleeping bag...I did that by 7:30pm. I soaked my feet in the stream and they are still numb. It is great to settle in. This is part of my hike that I really love. There are many conversations going on...I do enjoy the hiker comraderie.","Pinefield Hut

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534929,"Once again I wake up after Crisscross and it is cold and wet. I woke a couple of times during the night and it was raining. Sunray went behind the hut and was able to get close to a deer. I got a nice photo of that. Aurora, Conundrum, Crisscross, Sunray, Stuart, McGoober and I decided to go to a wayside restaurant about 8 miles down the trail and do our wash at the campground nearby. We decided to go 7 more miles hiking and stay at the Skyland Resort. We'll rent one room and pack in there. We can all shower, eat at the restaurant and have a dry warm night. There was something different about this morning...no fog/mist. Okay. That is promising. I got off again at 7:30am and there was still mud on the trail. Nonetheless, it was good hiking. The bottom of my right foot felt sore again. I did not take ibuprofen this morning but I did take some a couple hours into the hike. There was a short side trail to a lookout so I dropped my pack and took it but was not very good in terms of views. There were clouds in the distance and trees in the way. There were some nice flowing creeks and many birds singing. I made good time to the Wayside restaurant. I got there at 10am with Aurora and Conundrum. Crisscross and Sunray were already there. Ran into am Mcdoubles, Cool Dad and Black Santa. I ordered eggs, sausage, potatoes, biscuit and side of two buckwheat pancakes. I was full but happy.We left the restaurant and hiked to Big Meadows Campground and washed our clothes, while we were there it started raining then hailing. The hail was small and did not last long. Brought back memories of the big hailstorm! A few weeks ago. I got back on the trail soon after. It had stopped raining but was still muddy. I started thinking of the Hobbit and how tough their quest was with all the hiking they did. But Bilbo and Frodo didn't have to wear socks or boots. They go barefoot everywhere. That is where I get the most problems...my feet. Maybe they had it easier! They must have carried lots of food because we all know Hobbits love to eat many times during the day. Maybe Crisscross and Blackbear are Hobbits, they eat like them  I am going to have to check their feet!!!!! Anyways, I have to worry about snakes, bears and chipmunks. Bilbo and Frodo had to worry about Orcs, Goblins, Warlocks and other bad creatures. Ok maybe the Hobbits had it harder. The sun started to come out and the views were back, at least a little bit. I walked by many small waterfalls streaming down rocks next to the trail. Very pretty. I hiked with Aurora a bit then with McGoober, we talked about each other's lives, I tried to convince her to stay with us at the lodge but she decided to press on. I actually started feeling lightheaded and stopped. I sat down, drank some water and ate a snickers. I guess I went a long time between eating something. I have to be careful especially with the hot weather coming. Aurora caught up and we walked together to the lodge. The lodge was very nice. We were all in the room, took showers and then went to the Tap Room for dinner and drinks. I had a local Brown Ale which was very good. During dinner a duo playing a guitar and a banjo entertained us. They played mostly old country music and they did a great job. We all walked back and turned in. It's nice to be dry and warm.","Bearfence Mountain

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535039,"We all got up around 7am and started packing. Aurora went out on the balcony and spotted 2 bears, a mom and cub. It was nice watching them move around. Crisscross and Sunray have been on the trail 2 months didn't see their irst bears until they stayed in a motel room! We all laughed about that!   We went to breakfast and it was very good. The service was slow but we weren't in a hurry. For today we are planning on only 11 miles to Pass Mountain Hut.  I saw a small bear right away, he was in the woods foraging for food and moving very slowly away from us. It is very exciting for me to see bears! I hiked the first mile with Freight Train and Sparky, then by myself the rest of the way. I must say this was one of the prettiest hikes so far. I walked on ridges with constant views. The weather was very nice, low 70's, clear and sunny. I ran into many day and section hikers on the trail. Because it is the Shenandoahs with easy access to trail from many parking areas, it is a popular hiking area. As I an only hiking 11.1 miles today, I took my time stopping frequently to take in the sites and take pictures. I feel good and my feet feel much better, I have kicked many rocks by accident and my right toe is hurting a bit. Always sumthin!  I arrived at Pass Mountain Hut at 4:30pm. It is nice getting in early. Aurora, Conundrum and Stuart were already there. Simple Man and Quirks(from Germany) arrived later. They have been with us 3-4 days. Crisscross and Sunray decided to keep going. It was a very nice evening, we all sat around and talked and tried to make a plan for the next few days laughing that by lunch time tomorrow we will change it. There were two ladies camping who came over and visited. One was about 20 yrs old and she was section hiking with her grandmother, 69 yrs old. Amazing lady, full of energy. We turned in about 8 pm, it's a new version night.","Skyland Resort & Restaurant

The birds were singing, the sun was coming up and the trail was beginning to dry. After a mile I heard a noise behind me and saw a bear running down hill away from me. It was moving fast! It was a brief view but I was able to see their speed. A while later I saw 3 white tail deer running to my right. They are so graceful and quiet when they run. I have seen many deer but not any with antlers yet. The trail is beautiful this morning. There weren't a lot of opportunities for views but pretty nonetheless. I am hiking along thinking again of the Hobbit and all the characters that come out in the story. I come around the corner of the trail and guess who is looking at me? A bear, this one stays a little longer and I just stand still; he is only about 15/20 yards away. When I reach for my phone he turns and runs down the trail. I speed up to follow and when I get to a turn I slow down and there he is looking at me. This goes on and I see him 4 times then he runs up into the woods and again he runs fast, even uphill. They are strong! My day is made and I'm not at the lunch place yet! I arrive at Elkwallow Wayside which is a store with a grill, I was happy and hungry. Bad news, they lost power and no grill but they will sell you things. I got a hoagie, big bag of chips, muffin and juice. I am satisfied. My fellow hikers showed up and we hung out for a while. I was there 3 hours relaxing and, of course, enjoying the good company. We all got our favorite cool one to drink and take for the evening. Back to hiking again...right away I saw a bear cub. He was at a distance but it was nice to see. The next 5 miles were so nice, the woods are pretty and views fantastic. I saw 2 more deer and one more bear. I thought a lot of my grandson, Noah, he is 3 1/2 years old. I do miss him, and I think of bringing him with me to section hike when he gets older. That would be so cool. I will have to start him on small hikes soon. Nice thoughts. I arrived at Gravel Springs Hut with Conundrum and Aurora around 3:30 pm. This is a pretty nice shelter with a stream right there. We eventually got a full house as hikers were streaming in. We saw a bear and took pictures...we were all excited! He went away then reappeared again and again, getting closer and closer, We eventually had to start scaring him away. Everyone was especially careful about their food...storing it that is. We all put our canned libation in the crew to get them cold, it worked. Another nice nite with lively conversation. Buenos Noches.","Pass Mountain Hut

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535505,"I had a good nights sleep. I saw the bear again just walking along in the distance while I was getting water. Aurora and Conundrum did not get much sleep since they camped and the the bear kept coming close to their tent. I got on the trail at 7:10am and right away I saw a deer running away. The trail continued to present me with beautiful, clear views and plenty of vegetation. Alex and Aaron are section hikers who stayed with us last night. I met them a few nights ago in a shelter when it was raining. I hiked with them a while and talked about the places we have traveled to. They are planning on hiking Mont Blanc which makes about a hundred mile loop in France, Italy and Switzerland. That sounds very interesting...I will have to look into that. A bunch of us stopped on a rock overlook on Marshall Mountain and took a bunch of pictures. It was very scenic and relaxing. Many times I think of the time commitment that it takes to have an adventure like this. I don't think I will do this again. I am thinking of doing the John Muir Trail in the near future. Three weeks is probably the maximum time that I would want to spend away from home. I am enjoying myself but I miss everyone and everything back home. I pretty much miss my normal life. My break off the trail is in 9 more days. I am looking forward to it but still have many more miles to cover before then. At first I wanted to reach Harper's Ferry before I got off. Now it looks like I will be 4 days past Harper's ferry. I may even make it to Pennsylvania before I get off. That would be great. The hike continues to be very nice and my pack is feeling light since I have exhausted my food supply. I will need to shop a little smarter this time to keep the weight down. There are so many different kinds of plants, trees and flowers. It would be nice to know what they are. I miss hiking with Junco. One reason is that he could name most plants and birds. I hiked the last 3 miles with Quirk and Simple Man. At 11:15 I arrived at Terrapin Station Hostel which we took a side trail of 1/2 mile to reach. It is a residential area and the hostel is in a garage type structure. It is very clean and comfy. The owner has a $30 hiker special which includes the bunk, shower, laundry, pizza and soda. A good deal!! He is also going to shuttle us into Front Royal for dinner and resupply. After I did my wash and took a shower, I ate a pizza and had some ice cream while finishing a puzzle someone had started. Spider-Man had helped me...but I could have done it on my own.  Conundrum, Aurora, Spider-Man, Alex, Aaron and I shuttled to a Mexican restaurant, Jaliscos. The food was very good. When we finished we were picked up and taken to the grocery store. The hostel owner is very nice and accommodating. When we got back to the hostel I made my peanut butter bagel sandwiches for tomorrow and packed my food bag. And I treated my hostel-mates to sangria with fruit...homemade. It went down well!   We wound down our evening by talking a bit and watching TV.   Lights out is at 10pm...

I have to get there because my plan for tomorrow is to meet some friends from Washington DC who will hike with me for 2 days. I will meet them Saturday 5 miles past the Shelter at 9:30am. I should be able to make that if I reach Dicks Dome today. Right away on the trail I exit the Shenandoahs. It has been very nice hiking there. The trail today did not have many scenic views but it made up for it with beautiful plants, flowers, thick forests and different types of terrain. I hiked by many different flowers blooming beautifully, with very aromatic scents. The trail went by meadows, public homes, chainlink fences, and marshy areas with small footbridges. Hooray for the trail volunteers who built them as they help to keep us out of the marshy areas and keep our feet dry. Our first stop was by the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter and WOW...it was top notch! It had a porch with Adirondack chairs, a pavilion with picnic table, a shower and horse shoe pit with horse shoes! It was really nice resting there and eating lunch. I joined Aurora, Conundrum, Simple Man, Quirk and Lucky Dog. When I finally took off again I met with very thick woods. I could not see very far into the woods at all because of all the vegetation. This was very different from what I have been hiking through. One thing that was consistent...Spring is in full bloom. The flowers were blooming and there were some very aromatic scents in the air. I traveled through more marshy areas with foot bridges and over creeks stopping by Manassas Gap Shelter for a water break. The temperature is rising and I am drinking much more water. It is HOT! There was a big black snake sleeping in the shelter rafters. I sure am glad that I am not staying there. With 4.5 miles to go the trail got a little rocky and the creek crossings were a little difficult. It was hot and the sun was out but the sun hardly touched me due to the thick canopy. It is also very humid now. I really have to keep hydrated.I had to cross a footbridge after a side trail to get to the shelter. It is octagonal in shape and only fits 4 people if you are creative enough. We were very creative tonight! It all worked out well. Lucky Dog, Trek(72 years old) and Shutterbug were in there with me. I think this is one of those rare times that I am the youngest in a group. It was a humid evening with thundering in the distance but it didn't rain on us. Goodnight.","Front Royal Hostel

It was humid but thank goodness we did not get any rain last night. Some of the trail is muddy though which indicates that the rain just missed us but got other parts of the trail. The trail was very muddy and the creeks were very high. There are lots of flowers along the trail and the forest has lots of vegetation. When I got to Sky Meadows State Park, the terrain changed. It is not as thick anymore and I come out on very pretty meadows. There are many trails that come off the AT and they are well marked. I reach the parking area where I will meet my friends, Rudy and company, at 9:15 am. While waiting for them, I met a section hiker who was dehydrated and therefore cutting his hike short. He said that he got dehydrated a couple of years ago and you can get dehydrated again but quicker once you have been there. He didn't want to risk that. I also met another man who was doing trail maintenance and gave me his number to call him if I needed a ride to the airport when I get off the trail next week. If he is not busy he will take me. The trail is full of Trailangels! A young lady drives up and asks if I am waiting for Rudy, her name is Kristen. She is one of the hikers that will be joining us. She drove from Charlottsville, where she is a law intern. Rudy and Gaby drive up soon after and we all get acquainted. Rudy and Gaby do not have backpacking experience but Kristen has a little. They were welcomed to a trail that was thick with vegetation and humid. We make a couple of creek crossings as we made our way slowly through muddy areas of the trail. After 3 miles we reached a shelter where we took a break. Ish and Two Socks come in...they are slack packing 25 miles! Oh to be young and fit! I introduce them to my friends and we all rest for a while then head off to Sam Moore Shelter which is 7 more miles. After a short way, we reach the beginning of the Rollercoaster part of the trail which goes for 13.5 miles and, of course, has lots of ups and downs. In this heat and humidity it is brutal! This will be tough for my friends and it will be tough for me too! And as we expected, it was tough. What makes it worse is the weather...it's in the 80's and humid. We stop many times for breaks...well deserved too I might add! This takes me back to when I started this journey and I was only doing 8/10 miles per day. I've come a long way and I am loving it. We finally reached the Sam Moore Shelter, 10.3 miles down the road. Rudy, Kristen and Gaby sleep in the shelter and I pitch my tent. A section hiker Jason makes a fire which Kristen was really wanting. I saw Ginger Patch again and met a section hiker named Barry who is also from Houston and retired from Exxonmobil too.

Kristen heated some water for me to make oatmeal and hot tea. That was really good! Barry will be hiking with us to Bears Den...his car is parked there. We are the last to leave but are in no hurry. Right away I reach the 1000 mile mark of the trail. Whoop! Whoop! Another milestone! It was good to have someone with me on the trail to celebrate with! We continue on and although it is still hot and humid, it doesn't seem as hot as yesterday. We come across a creek crossing that I can see is going to be a challenge. Kristen makes it across but Gaby has trouble and she takes her pack off. Kristen takes the pack and Gaby makes it across. Barry slips and his foot goes in while trying to help Gaby. Rudy and I make it across ok.  We make it to Bears Den and it seems like we hiked more that 3 miles. I decide to stay the night in the Hostel. The Hostel looks like a small castle. It was actually built in the early 1900's by a physician and his wife from Washington DC as a summer home. It is made of stone and looks like an English Country side home.Barry offers to take the group back to their car...that was a really nice gesture. We say our goodbyes and they are off. Barry comes back as he will be staying at the hostel as well. I see Spiderman in the driveway and meet his mom and brother who will hike with him four days. It is nice to see the family of hikers come out and hike. Besides my wife who hiked a couple of miles with me and my cousin David who hiked several miles with me, Rudy is the only family/friend that has come out over night with me!!!! Take note family and friends...come join me!!!!  The rest of the day is mostly relaxing and enjoying the company of other hikers. Some I know,others are new to me. These are nice times when you can catch up with everybody and hear funny or serious stories that have happened out on the trail. The hostel does not open until 5pm but we can hang out in the downstairs bunk room. There is a shower there and we all take advantage of it. There are also loaner clothes that we can put on until we wash our clothes. I have lost so much weight that nothing fits me so I have to hold my loaner pants with my hands so they don't fall off me! How do guys walk around with their pants halfway down their butt??? There is a scale there so I weigh myself. I HAVE LOST 31 LBS!!! I am at 151 now. Unbelievable, I did not think it was possible to get that low for me! I need to eat more! Once the hostel officially opens we go upstairs where the living room and kitchen is. It is a very nice and relaxing place. For $30 we get a bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, soda and a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Great deal! In the area that I sleep in there are quite a few hikers...Aurora, Conundrum, Quirk, Simple Man, Barry, Pinky and Lost & Found. We decide to watch a movie, Blazing Saddles.

I ate 5 pancakes and was full. I got going about 8am. I walked down to the parking area first to see the carving of a bear in a tree trunk. It looked really good. Someone has some skills! My goal was to go 16 miles to a campsite then tomorrow walk 4 miles into Harper's Ferry for breakfast. Not too far into the hike I reached the Virginia border into West Virginia. I hiked over 500 miles through Virginia to get here! Yes, another state left behind! The initial walk was more up and down,then I came out of the woods to Ravens Rock lookout. It was beautiful! Even though I am afraid of heights, I took off my pack and sat down with my feet hanging off the edge nice. More hikers showed up and decided to stay for a while enjoying the view. When I got back onto the Roller-coaster, the forest changed from very thick to new growth and it wasn't so full of vegetation. No more towering Ash trees. I finally reached to the north end of the Roller-coaster...fantastic! After that, the trail leveled out but there were many sections full of rocks so that slowed me down. The day was a little warm, about 80 degrees, but overall, it was a nice day. I stopped by the AT Blackburn Center for a break and was given a soda and some cake. It is owned by the AT club, they have functions there, and have bunks for hikers in a separate cabin. It was a quarter mile hike down and now I had to hike the quarter mile up. I started heading north again only to be greeted with more rocky parts. I made my way to the David Lesser Memorial Shelter which was very nice. I am actually going 6 more miles to a campsite. There is no water on the way and no water at the campsite either so I must stock up here and carry more than normal. It was quite a hike to get water, quarter mile down which means I have to come back up a quarter mile . It is tough doing miles that you don't get credit for. Aurora and Conundrum were already at the at the shelter with their tent pitched. I rested a bit after I got water. Simple Man, Pinky and Quirk were taking a long break there also, they have the same plan as I do.As I hike on, the trail is noticeably more rockier than earlier. That made it really tough to walk on. I was fortunate to see a lot of squirrels and chipmunks. You might have observed that I do not have any pictures of chipmunks...that is because they are so darned quick and shy. I've tried to take pictures but have not been successful. I arrive at the campsite and Spider-Man is there with his mother and brother. I talk to them for a bit and make the decision to walk to Harpers Ferry, 4 more miles. It wasn't much of a campsite so since I had the energy I thought I should move on. I give the other hikers most of my water and head out. I met a father and son who were section hiking and walk the rest of the way with them. They are finishing their hike and then heading out of town. The hike in to Harpers Ferry is pretty and there are some historical landmarks which I stop and read. I like to take my time and read all the historical markers. That made for a slow walk though. I arrived into the historical part of town and checked into Towns Inn hostel. It is an old building. I settle in my bunk, take a shower, go next door to the restaurant and stay there a couple of hours, relaxing, eating and drinking wine. What a nice ending to along day.","Bears Den Hostel

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535965,"I slept pretty good and got up early even when I didn't need to. I decided to take a zero day and arrange transportation for when I fly home on Saturday. I walked to a restaurant for breakfast but I didn't realize that it was so far. Quirk, Simple Man and Pinky are supposed to eat there this morning from our original plan but I am not sure if they are still going to follow through with that. When I arrive, they are not there. I order a hearty breakfast and hot tea...it was a very good meal. Right when I'm finishing here they come! I sit with them a while and head over to the AT Center which is the official headquarters for the AT trail. Most hikers check in there and get their picture taken and put into the hiker register. It is a neat place with knowledgeable people.   I see Spider-Man with his family there. I get my picture taken and find out that I am #389 thru hiker. When I signed in at Springer Mountain, the beginning, I was around #600 starting. I stayed a while, used the computer, and read some of their information. Many more hikers come in including Aurora and Conundrum who are staying at the same place that I am. Harpers Ferry is a very historical town and has great significance in commerce, railroading and the Civil War. This is a must visit town for anybody. John Brown became famous when he took over an armory to try to free slaves. He was unsuccessful but many believe he began the conflict which led to the Civil War. I walked around and read everything I could see, plaques, markers and registers. I am a real sucker for History stuff. The day was hot but nice in the shade. It was a perfect day to visit the local pub for a local brew with some other hikers. I went to the same restaurant as yesterday for dinner, next door, with Aurora, Conundrum, Moon Boots and Bug Juice. I got the macaroni and cheese again because it was so good. A couple of glasses of wine topped off my night. Another good day.","Harpers Fery WV High Street

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536189,"Today was a slack packing day. I paid a Shuttle driver to take me 22 miles down the trail and I hiked back. It was a nice morning but it turned hot right away. My first stop was at the Washington Monument, the original one. It has a lot of history and I climbed it for some great views. It was built by the towns people many years ago to commemorate George Washington. I came up on many Civil War battle areas and of course I read all the plaques. They were all very interesting. A lot of men died in that war and I still do not understand why. Most of the trail is a mixture of nice and rocky terrain and no long ups or downs. I come up to Gathland State Park where there is some battlefield history and a War Correspondents Monument. Another great thing is there is a Trail Angel with trail magic. Lots of fruit, vegetables, cookies, muffins, chips and drinks. I stay a while and take some pictures and head out. A little further down the trail I run into Sweet Potato who took 5 days off in Baltimore and is hiking with a friend for a few days. It was nice to see her. Some of the trail coming into Harpers Ferry is very rocky. It takes a little time to navigate but the last part is flat and joins the C&O Canal Path. Some of it is along the Shenandoah River and is very pretty. I finish the hike by crossing over a train trestle which has a walking path next to it. I arrived at 4:15pm and it was HOT!!!   I took a shower and met up with Aurora and Conundrum for a farewell Italian dinner since it will probably be the last time I see them on the trail. When I get back on I will be 11 days behind. It will be hard to catch up to them. I will be behind many hikers I have spent time with and I will miss them. When I get back to the trail I hope to meet up with other hikers that I met early on who are behind me and make new friends.","Harpers Ferry WV High Street

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537628,"I had some fruit for breakfast and made my way over to the ATC. I had ordered new replacement boots but my new boots were not there nor were they at the Post Office. I did not think they would arrive in time but I was hoping that they would. At the ATC I ran into Oriole. He had gotten off the trail and went home for a few days. That was easy for him since he is from Baltimore. He enjoyed his break but he is back now. I also saw Diesel, Cold Snap and Highlander, who told me Nomad had to get off the trail because he fell and broke some ribs but, he is hoping to get back on later. I spent my afternoon shopping and sight seeing. I had dinner with the husband of the hostel owner and he invited me to go to listen to a Keltic band in another town. I, of course, accept. We travel about 20 minutes and arrive at an old style general store where we found lots of things like hardware store items and knickknacks. In the back room there is a group of 7 musicians playing Keltic music. About 25 people are sitting around watching and listening. The music sounds really good and the instruments are interesting..different. We stay for about an hour then head back. It was a very nice evening.  Back at the Hostel there are only 2 female section hikers from Wisconsin and myself there. We stay up talking for a bit before I go to sleep.","I 70 Footbridge, US 70

I have a little time to spare when I arrive so I explore. I have never been to this station before.  I don't spend too much time as I need to catch the subway to Reagan International Airport. When I get in I find out that my flight is delayed because of rain back home but I finally get on and head home.  I do have some weird feelings about going home for a break. Part of me wants to continue and make progress on the trail and the other part wants a break. I do miss my everyday normal life. Looking forward to seeing my wife, grandson, mom, family and friends. I am sure my body needs it and it will give me time to go through my gear and clothes. I may not have any entries for a few days while I take a break. Woo Hoo! HOME!","I 70 Footbride, US 70

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538358,"My 10 days off the trail are over!! I am really anxious to get back to hiking, but I am having mixed feelings about it. There were things I planned on doing while I was home that I just didn't do...like keeping up my journal! I just felt like relaxing and being lazy and I enjoyed every minute of doing just that. I watched some movies, had some massages, shared some great meals, and spent time with family and friends. I planned my break so that I could go to my 40th high school reunion. It was amazing to see some of my ex class mates. The break was fantastic! I'm going to miss everyone...again. My wife will be coming up to visit in less than 3 weeks...I can't wait!My son Gabriel gave me a ride to the airport. It is time to get back to the second half of my trail life. After landing in Baltimore I took an Uber back to where I left off near Boonsboro, MD. I priced the taxi and it was twice as much as Uber!! It is great to have options. I really did not change my gear at home. I just got another t-shirt and hiking pants and I cleaned and aired everything out. My pack is at 32lbs with food and water. My goal was to start by 2:45 pm and do 9 miles and I came close to starting at that time. It is hot, in the mid 80's.   I was dreading hiking in the heat but once I got in the woods, it was not that bad. The trail was relatively flat but then it became very rocky so I had to slow down. I had a couple of good views especially on Black Rocks. I got to Ensign Phillip Cowall Shelter at 6:15pm. To my surprise Justin was there. I have not seen him in maybe a month and a half. We had shared some good times. I only did 8.9 miles today and I feel tired. I can blame it on jet lag but I know that I need to get back in shape! Bedtime came at 7:30 pm","I 70 Footbride, US 70

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538435,"I met some new hikers since I am behind most of the group I had been hiking with...they are Chicken Feet, Crocs and Helter Skelter. I got going a little late at 7:45am. I have been behind on my sleep from my trip home and I tried to make it up last night. One night of trying to get it back won't cut it though. I will need another good night since I still feel sluggish. The morning was nice and cool, in the high 60's, but it quickly got into the 70's sunny but mostly shady. I started hiking mostly in the woods but would come out to some meadows. The meadows were not very large so I quickly got back into the shade of the trees. There were quite a few creek crossings and there were very rocky sections of the trail. I did have a first...a chipmunk stopped long enough for me to take its picture. I have seen many chipmunks but they are so fast that I could never get a picture until now!!!! While I was home I visited the dentist for a cleaning and my podiatrist. The podiatrist cut about 2/3 of my right big toe nail off, it was cracked from bumping into rocks so many times and was hurting. I was hoping it would not affect me when I got back on the trail but on the steep downhills with rocks, it hurt when my foot would slide forward in my boot. It isn't too bad but I hope it gets better fast.I came out on a couple of views, Raven Rock Cliff and High Rock. At High Rock it was a 0.2 mile side trail. I dropped my pack and went to check it out. It was a great view of the valley. One side was the Antietam battlefield and on the other side was Gettysburg. I am really not that smart...a local was there and she let me know what I was looking at.  I had a nice afternoon of hiking. I came up to Pen Mar County Park and ran into Goldberry doing Trail Magic. If you remember, I started hiking on the same day as Goldberry and her husband Bombadil and met them at the start. She only had 90 days off from her job and it was time for her to go back to the real world, but before she did she was doing trail magic and supporting her two daughters who are also through hiking. It was very good to see her again, she is a very sweet lady. I finished Maryland and entered Pennsylvania. 6 states finished and 8 to go. I ended up at Tumnbling Run Shelter. The shelter was cool..it had two sleeping areas with a picnic table in between. There was a sign on one that said ""Snoring"" and the other ""Non Snoring"". It worked too! There was one in the snorer and four of us in the other. Lieutenant Dan was there. He is a section hiker that I had met the day before. There was also a mother and son section hikers. The snorer was a recent high-school graduate who was taking a gap year and hiking the AT. Nice group. I got in my sleeping bag at 8:30pm hoping to get plenty of rest. I got tired today while hiking which shows that I still need to get back into shape.","Ensign Phillip Cowall

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538438,"I woke up at 7am as Lieutenant Dan was leaving, this is the latest in quite a long time that I have woken up. I feel that I have caught up on my sleep now and I am ready to go. I left at 8:15am with temperature in the upper 60's and a little drizzle. I saw a couple of deer right away. They took off running and didn't make a sound. I would have missed them if I wasn't paying attention. There was a good view at Chimney Rock and later I saw another deer. This time I saw it before it saw me. I stopped and as it came around the bend of the trail it saw me and stopped. We stood there looking at each other as if we were daring the other to move! I made a slow move for my phone to get a picture but it took off...maybe next time. A little later I came up on a clearing and saw my first wild turkey. It took off flying and got about 10 ft off the ground then started gliding down hill. The turkey looked very graceful, not a word you would associate with a turkey it fit. I hiked by myself all morning as it rained off and on and I came up on Caledonia State Park. Goldberry was there doing trail magic again. This time she had a park BBQ grill going and you cooked your own hot dogs or hamburgers. She had all the trimmings with snacks and drinks. She was set up under a pavilion. I spent almost 2 hours there and met up with other hikers. She told me that Aurora and Conundrum had come by trail magic the day before about 5 minutes after I had left! The rain had let up by the time I started hiking again. Three miles later I arrived at Quarry Gap Shelter. This shelter was amazing with two sleeping areas with a breezeway in between and a picnic table. It had hanging flower pots, a sundial and a bench swing. Somebody takes pride in taking care of this shelter! I heard the shelters in Pennsylvania were great and so far it is true. It started to rain again slightly. 7 miles down the trail I arrived at Birch Run Shelter There were a few hikers there already including a couple I had met quite a while ago. I was tired and was hoping the shelter was not full because the forecast was for thunderstorms tonight and the next day. There were 8 bunks and 5 were taken. I grabbed an upper bunk and got settled. I got water and washed up in the creek. I sat down to eat when I heard someone call my name...it was Aurora and Conundrum, my hiking buddies! It was great to reunite with them. They grabbed the last two spots in the shelter and we caught up. When I got off the trail to go home they had hiked on but Aurora's Grandfather had gotten ill, so they both got off the trail to visit him and he passed away. He was 100 years old. They ended up getting on the trail the same day I did and we actually camped at the same place the first day back only we didn't know it. They got there early and I got there late. I left in the morning before they did without even seeing each other. Amazing! It was a good day! I got in the bunk at 8:30pm but had a rough night. There was one snorer and wow could he snore!! The snoring was so bad that two hikers got out of the shelter and set up tents in the pouring rain! I didn't want to be that adventurous so I just lay there. At least my body rested as I was laying down even though I did not get much sleep.","Tumbling Run Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538466,"I slept very little due to the snorer and I was not the only one either! Around 6am a very bad storm came through with lightning and thunder that was very loud. It poured down very hard. There were quite a few hikers under the porch roof. The hikers who camped were all there so it was a little crowded. I got up and started getting my gear together and one by one the hikers started leaving. I followed Aurora and Conundrum about 15 minutes later. It was raining but not as hard as earlier. It was 7:50 when I left. My plan was to get to Pine Grove and have lunch at the General Store then maybe take the half gallon challenge. This challenge is for through hikers who have reached the halfway point, if you can eat a half gallon of ice cream, you get a little wooden spoon. There is no time limit...you just have to finish it. I met up with Aurora and Conundrum about 6.5 miles out at Tom's Run Shelter. We hiked the rest of the way together. The trail was wet and mostly down hill. It wasn't too rocky but we did have to watch our steps. We arrived just before noon and all of us ordered the hiker burger and fries. It was a big burger with avocado and fried egg. The fries were excellent as well. I was planning on staying at the Ironmaster's Mansion Hostel next door to the general store which did not open until 5pm. The weather made a turn for the worst so Aurora and Conundrum decided not to hike on and stay at the hostel as well. We always seem to change each others minds on our hiking plans!! Good to have them back. Many hikers came and went and most were taking the challenge. Some made it and some did not! Goldberry showed up and sat with us while she waited for her daughter to come in. It was fun watching some hikers while they struggled to finish the ice cream. I started it but Aurora and Conundrum had to help me, I am definitely a lightweight when it comes to eating ice cream!  The biggest achievement today was that we reached the official 2016 halfway mark. The AT changes the route at some point on the trail just about every year because of construction, and all sorts of necessary interruptions to the trail. Hence, the halfway point ultimately changes. Another huge accomplishment. I want to say it is all downhill from here but I don't think it will be! There was an AT Museum down the street, it was interesting and informative and it had a great children's section too! I went over to the hostel and checked in. It was built in 1829 as a gift from a husband to his wife and it is still in good shape. We got bunk, sheets, shower, towels, dinner and breakfast for $35. Now that is a great deal! I also had a package waiting for me which had my new boots. My old ones were getting worn out since I put over 1000 miles on them. I got the exact same pair, Oboz Traverse Mids free from Oboz. They gave a lifetime guarantee for thru hikers!!!! I am looking forward to trying them out tomorrow.","Birch Run Shelter

I mostly drink hot tea but thought I needed to expand my options. I got out about 8:15am and stopped by an old furnace ruin called Pine Grove. They used to make cannonballs for the south then the north during the Civil War. After the war they made pots and cast iron kettles.  The first part of the hike was relatively easy with a nice gradual uphill then downhill to a deli 9 miles out. I met up with many hikers there and ordered a burger and a quart of sweet tea...excellent. I hiked a bit with Yard Sale. He was working as an accountant in Georgia, sold everything including his house, and is hikng the trail. Hus plans are to relocate to Colorado or Idaho when he finishes. After the deli there was a lot of ups and downs until the trail came out to a cornfield. I walked about 2 miles along these her picturesque fields. There was a side trail to the campsite where I planned to set up camp tonight. Tweed, Chickenfeet, Aurora, Conundrum and a few other hikers arrived. A lot of towns cater to hikers and offer lots of specials. I walked to town to take a $2 shower at the public pool and, fortunately for me it happened to be $5 Friday. That included swimming and the use of the shower. That was a no brainer...I jumped in the pool! The water was from the river and was nice and cold. I let the child in me out and went down the slides too. That was fun. After a shower, I went to the restaurant and split a large pizza with Chicken feet. Needing something to wash the pizza down with, we walked to the Tavern and tried a local IPA. Back at the campsite many more hikers had arrived. We were right by the RR tracks and the trains were loud. Add that to late nite hikers coming in from the tavern and a 10 year old girl there with her dad who talked very loud past mdnight and then popped fireworks.

They are 70 year old thru hikers from Maine. The forecast today is for a high of 90 degrees and when I got going at 8:45 am, it was clear and already hot! I hiked the first few miles along farmlands and cornfields which gave way to wheat fields. On and on, field after field, again very picturesque. Coming from the Texas coast, all this is amazing to me, mountains, woods and farmlands. Baytown, where I live is very flat. I got lots of sun and drank lots of water. I need to really pay attention to my water intake. It is easy to get dehydrated with this heat. I crossed many roads and got back into the woods. My lunch venue was next to a river under an underpass 11 miles from where I started today. There were a few kayakers there and four of them talked to me about my hike and became trail angels when they gave me a Corona! It went great with my lunch! It didn't take long for me to get to the shelter I was planning to stay at tonight. Aurora and Conundrum were already there and it was only 2:30pm. Since it was so early, I considered hiking further.

My plan is to visit an outfitter whenever I can get to one to see what the problem is. My destination for breakfast is a town named Duncannon. I am planning to spend a few hours there charging my phone charger and cell phone then I'll eat lunch before hiking out. On the way to Duncannon I came to a great view at Hawk Rock and stopped there for a while. I made it to town at 9:15am. It's one of those towns where the trail goes right through it. I stopped at Goodies for breakfast with Chicken Feet and stayed there about 2.5 hrs while charging my electronics. Chicken feet got to hiking at 11:00. I walked to a store and picked up a few food items. Aurora and Conundrum came into town earlier and we all had lunch at the historic Doyle hotel. A few other hikers joined us. The fried fish sandwich and sweet tea I had for lunch was great. We sat there talking and finally got going at 2:15 pm. As I walked through town and crossed over two bridges across two rivers I saw people enjoying the water. It was hot so it was tough seeing people in the river while I was sweating with 30 lbs on my back!I then entered the woods for a 2 mile 1000 ft rocky climb. It was a good climb but the hard part was actually when it flattened out with big slanted rocks. Thank goodness I decided to stay at the first shelter and not join Chicken Feet at the next one. It will give my feet a break. I was able to wash up and feel refreshed again. My tuna dinner was very enjoyable and a I a honeybun for dessert.

I had to really plan my water, 13 miles before the next water source, carried 2 1/2 liters just in case I normally carry a little over a liter to save on weight. Waterfall was first to leave then I went right after him. It was 6:30am and about 70 degrees.All I can say about the hike was that it is ROCKY!!! Rocks everywhere and that does not help my tender feet. I did come up on a beautiful view from Table Rock. There were times I felt that time and miles were flying by, and others that I was trudging along trying to avoid the rocks and save myself from foot pain. Stopped for lunch at a spring and Aurora and Conundrum were there with their shoes and socks off. They were having the same foot problems as I was. It seems when you get off the trail for 10 days your feet get tender again and you have to go through a toughening up phase. It seemed that it took forever to reach Rausch Gap Shelter, especially when your just trying not to trip and being wise on our foot placement. The shelter was 0.3 miles off the trail but the walk was flat and no rocks. Waterfall and Chicken Feet were already there. The water source was right in front of the shelter, so convenient.

Hopefully we will be in the shade of the trees all day. Coming out of the shelter we came up on a old RR bridge with a creek under it. The water was coming from a culvert and was called the Rausch Gap Diversion Well. Water is piped from a dam some distance away and discharges under a bed of limestone then out of the culvert. The water is acidic due to the industry up river. This process brings the PH up so fish could survive in the water...very interesting. I hiked on for 6 miles and came up on some wonderful trail magic...Chopped beef sandwiches, fruits, cookies, drinks and many other snacks. I stayed there talking to the 2 couples supplying everything along with other hikers. It was so appreciated by us all. Dirty Ernie was one of the gentlemen supplying the food and he through hiked the AT when he was 65. He plans to do it again when he turns 75! He was also quite a character. He told us that there was no night hiking permitted in Pennsylvania because that is when they come out to sharpen the rocks! I believe him. About a mile after I left there someone had put an ice chest next to the trail with some cold Ginger Ale...another nice act by a trail angel. Aurora Conundrum and I then crossed an old steel bridge. It was actually moved from a different location and put in the park. We saw a Mulberry tree and helped ourselves to some of the sweet fruit. After we crossed the bridge, there was more trail magic. A couple had snacks out of their minivan in a parking lot. I took a Gatorade, banana and cookie for later. Wow, 3 instances of trail magic within 1.5 miles. It certainly helps to lift our spirits. The rest of the hike was an assortment of rocky trails and overgrown vegetation taking over the trail and smooth ground. Another obstacle I have not mentioned is the Gnats. They fly around your head while you hike and just love to get in your eyes. They say it is the moisture they are after. I will need to invest in a bug net to put over my head. I am using sunglasses to help but when it is overcast and under the canopy of the trees it is difficult to see the rocks. We came out to a couple of great overlooks...Fisher Lookout was one. It was very nice with large rocks that you could sit on and enjoy the wide view of the valley. I arrived at 501 Shelter. It was like a cabin with 12 bunks, an outdoor shower and water. We were also able to order pizza and they delivered to a nearby parking lot. Chicken Feet, Waterfall, Leggs, Verge(Goldberry and Bombadils daughters) and another hiker slept in the shelter and Aurora, Conundrum and 2 other couples tented outside.

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539297,"Aurora, Conundrum, Chickenfeet and I had a 3 day plan, so far we have stuck to it for the first two days. Today we will only do 9 miles and get picked up at a road crossing to go to Rock and Sole Hostel. It is a new hostel that is not in our guide but it is on the AT website and we also heard about it from other hikers. They had a lot of good things to say about it and they will shuttle us to Yuengling Brewery, the oldest one in the country. We all slept well, it rained a bit around 5:30am but stopped when we got up at 6am. It was a nice cool morning in the 60's. We all got an early start because we wanted to make t to the brewery's last tour which begins at 1:30pm. We do have our priorities!! The weather remained nice throughout the hike but it was rocky again and fortunately the weather seems to have kept the gnats to a minimum. I had a couple of nice overlooks. In spite of the rocks we made pretty good time. We got picked up by Craig, the owner of the hostel. It is at his house, the bunks are in his one time tool shed. Everything is nice and clean. There were 5 bunks and 4 more in the basement of the house, an outdoor heated shower, bathroom and sink. He had snacks inside that we could purchase and complimentary hot chocolate mix and tea bags. We just changed and headed strait to Pottsville PA. Pottsville has quite a history, it had the first professional NFL championship team. Like many Pennsylvania towns this was a big Coal town in the past. Craig dropped us off at an Italian restaurant since we had time and we all got pizza by the slice. It was 10 times better than last nights pizza. We then walked over to the brewery and walked around the gift shop while we waited for the tour to begin. If I was not hiking I would have bought a shirt and mug! They were nice. The tour was great and informative. It was built in 1829 and has been owned by a Yuengling ever since, lots of history. After the tour we got to try 2 beers and of course we had to purchase another. Chicken Feet does not care for beer too much so he bought a Yuengling ice cream and poured the beer in it making a beer float! Craigs wife picked us up and took us to resupply our groceries then back to the hostel. Dinner and breakfast are included in the price so she said dinner at 6:30pm on the porch of the house. We showered, relaxed and hungout till dinner. We had hamburgers that Craig grilled, steamed broccoli, potato casserole, carrots with ranch dressing, drinks and dessert which was Yuengling Black and Tan ice cream on a brownie. Yum Yum. Craig then built a fire and we sat around it and talked. There was a creek running right behind the property...What a wonderful setting. I gathered my supplies, organized myself and laid down. This is one of those plans that we actually stuck with and it came out perfectly!","501 Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539418,"Conundrum had been having problems with a blister on his big toe. It popped and got pretty painful. He and Aurora decided to take a zero day and try to recover. A hiker named Harry had come in late yesterday on crutches. He hurt his knee. I had actually met him 2 days ago during a stop for lunch. He will also zero at the hostel and try to get well. If his knee does not heal he will go home and see another doctor. As you can tell, there are many injuries on the trail. They can really derail your plans.We had a nice breakfast on the porch. It was a beautiful morning but it started to rain as we ate. The rain did not last long but the forecast called for it to rain again later then stop in the evening. One of the things we do regularly is check the forecast on the trail. It really helps when you are prepared for rain or whatever is coming. Craig dropped Chicken Feet and myself back at the trail. I have a theory about the trail in Pennsylvania. I believe that Pennsylvanians collected all the rocks throughout the state and dumped them on the AT trail. How else did all those rocks get there??? The hike today was very similar to the past days, rocks then normal trail, more rocks then bigger rocks. It is not fun when you are hiking with your head down watching your footing all the time. It makes it hard to appreciate your surroundings. Every once in a while I just stop and look around trying to take in the beauty of the woods and hoping to see some wildlife. I am sure I passed some deer, bears, and other animals without noticing them. I came up on two young guys hiking towards me. They looked familiar but I did not say anything. One of them asked if we had met but I could not remember actually meeting them. He then said that we met in a parking lot while I was waiting for my friends from Washington DC then again at the shelter that night. I DID remember them. They were doing a 2 day shakedown hike. That is when you go out to test your gear and supplies in preparation for a longer hike. They had been hiking for 11 days and had about 12 to go. Small world!The last part of the hike today was a very steep descent. I had to go very slowly. My poles would have helped but they are in my backpack since I haven't fixed the malfunction. It was slow going. There was even a part where we had to use a rope to help us down or up in that section depending on ones hiking direction. I arrived in Port Clinton crossing RR tracks then a bridge over a refreshing looking river. This area was so picturesque. I walked into town and went to Franks Barber Shop where many hikers congregate. They are very hiker friendly and have coffee and cookies for hikers. You can get a haircut or just sit around and charge your phone and talk to everyone in there. I went in and sat down and met Whitetop and Braids there. They were getting a shuttle ride to the next town and their plan was to stay in a hotel and resupply. I decided to go with them since I wanted to go to the library and catch up on my blog. I also have poison ivy on my arms and legs and wanted a shower and air conditioning since it was itching me pretty good. Steve shuttled us over. He is very talkative and only asks for gas money...that's a good deal! He also offered to take me to the library and pick me up when I was finished. I am glad that he offered because the library was about 1.5 miles away. I accepted! Another good day with the rocky trail and a little rain making it interesting. About 76 more miles to New Jersey, can't wait to leave these rocks behind.","PA 183

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539579,"I had a continental breakfast with Whitecap and Braids at the hotel. Steve picked us up at 7am and we were hiking by 7:10am. With the temperature in the low 70's, it was nice. My poison ivy was not itching as much and my spirits were high. I didn't sleep well last night, but I feel better. My plan is to hike to Eckville Shelter, 14.8 miles. It has a shower so I get to be clean again!The hike started with a climb of 800 ft over 2 miles. That's not bad but some parts were steep. There were some nice trails and rocky ones off and on...surprise, surprise! I came out on Pulpit Rock Overlook. That was a great view. I had met 3 young ladies day hiking earlier today on the trail and they were there taking in the sights. I got them to take my picture and told them about trail magic and trail angels. They were excited to do that in the near future. Hikers, be on the lookout for them!! I hiked over a tough section of big rocks and then more rocks. Since I was in a better frame of mind today, it did not seem so bad. There was another view that I missed. It did not have a sign and I passed the side trail. I hiked down an old dirt/rock road for about 4 miles then stopped at a spring, got some water, and had lunch. I made it to the Shelter at 2:30 pm. It was early in the day, but I decided to stay. My big toe was hurting and I did't want to make it worse. My feet actually feel better for the most part and I want to keep it that way. The next 3 days are supposed to be tough with many rocks. A few hikers came but left after a short break. I took a shower and washed my clothes. I was having dinner when it started raining and the hikers started pouring in. Many hikers were in the shelter riding out the rain until they could set up their tents. There were only 6 bunks available so the others had to use the campsite. There is a public road in front of the shelter and somebody dropped off a watermelon, we cut it up and it was good! Looking forward to a good nights sleep.","Port Clinton PA

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539711,"I got up early at 5:10am along with almost everyone else. I took my time getting ready and left at 6:30am. Not far into my hike I ran into Yardsale where he was camping. Unfortunately his achilles was hurting so he would be hiking slowly on the rocks. The trail was rocky from the start of the hike today...Big rocks then little rocks then boulders everywhere. It was very slow going. I was thinking of hiking 22 miles but this was going to be one of those slow going days due to the rocky terrain so I may just settle for 17. I stopped at Allentown Hiking Club Shelter where I met Can Do and Backscratcher. It was time for a break so I sat and read the journal only to see that Chicken Feet was there last night! He is half a day ahead.It seems that most of us are going to a restaurant 0.3 miles off the trail for lunch. I arrived at the restaurant at 11:30am but it did not open till noon. I hung out in the back shaded area relaxing and eventually had lunch with 2 Pack, Zuko, Can Do and Backscratcher. My salad and burger were tasty and filling but that didn't stop me and the other hikers from deciding to get dessert. I had a chocolate brownie with ice cream. Yum Yum!! It was okay hiking for a bit then we hit the rocks again. There were a couple of nice views then a little later we went through a challenging part of the trail...The Knife Edge. There is an incredible view from there but it was tough and slow hiking on the big slabs of rocks that were on a slant.  Whitecap took a spill just before there. He broke his glasses and got a cut under his eye but he seems to be ok.  After a good nights sleep and my mental state being really good, I didn't mind the rocks today. It was a hard hike but good. We got trail magic just before the shelter where there were 2 guys with sodas and honeybuns! It was well appreciated. I got to the shelter and Zuko hiked down to get water for us. It was a long hike. We had dinner and hung our bear bags. My feet felt good this morning but they hurt tonight. This was the first time in a while that I did not tape my feet but I am thinking that I will use tape tomorrow. Until tomorrow.","Eckville Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540005,"I would like to talk about trail hygiene since I have had some questions from my friends about that. There are many things to worry about on the trail like Lyme Disease from ticks, Staph infections, Noro Virus, and intestinal problems due to bad water. Yesterday, when I got trail magic, one of the trail angels shared that he had walked the AT last year but had to quit in NY when he got a staph infection. He got blisters and was scratching them and admitted that his hygiene was not what it should have been. Crock and Verge who are hiking the trail now both had to seek medical attention a week or so ago due to illness but they are both back on the trail. They were tested for Lyme disease but the blood tests take a while to get back. We must always be on the lookout for ticks. When caught early and treated, recovery is quick. We must also always filter and/or treat the water we drink to make sure to eliminate bacteria. Washing up and keeping clean is important. Most hikers will wash in the stream like I do. I have written that I bathe in the creeks but it is really cupping your hands and washing your face and neck. Some will rinse their hair and legs. Most water sources aren't even big enough to soak your feet. So it is tough to do but you do it when you can. Yard Sale also got sick because of something bad that he ate. The weather is getting warmer so food will not keep as long in our backpacks. There are a lot of things to think about. If you have any questions or are curious about our life out on the trail, please send me a note via the blog. Remember, kids also read my blog so be mindful of the subject and language. 
I got going this morning around 6:30am and thought I was the first to leave until I ran into Yardsale. He snuck out this morning! It was rocky but we got through ok. Yardsale and I met up again when we stopped for a break and water at George Outbridge Shelter. It would be 12 miles before the next water source so I carried 2 1/2 liters. We came to a very steep trail heading down to the Lehigh River. I walked over the bridge then came to the uphill climb. Michael(Denmark) and Napster(Germany) were resting before the climb up so we chatted for a little while. The climb was a challenge because it is very steep and full of boulders. This was definitely a place to use your hands and scoot on you butt to get from rock to rock. It was challenging but the reward was a great view of Lehigh River Valley. The area from the top on about 3/4 miles is called the Palmerton Superfund Site. It was deforested due to Zinc smelting between 1898 and 1980. The Government has spent millions of dollars off and on since then to get it cleaned up. Fortunately the vegetation is starting to come back but there is not much shade. Much of the trail was on a ridge line and had nice views of Palmerton and the valley beyond. It was a nice clear but hot day. 
I was not happy carrying the extra water up the boulders but now I'm glad I did. There were not many ups or downs the rest of the way but a long hike on rocky trails. My feet were paining me so much that I took 3 ibuprofen after lunch for the first time. It helped to carry me into camp. I arrived at Leroy Smith Shelter to find that I was the only one there. It took me a while to start getting my gear out and prepare my sleeping area. My pain and exhaustion were getting the better of me. When I finally got set up I hiked down to get water and to wash up. I felt better when I did that. I fixed my gourmet dinner...2 tuna sandwiches and a few other snacks. Soon after I started dinner I was happy to get a companion. A hiker named Mercury came in. She is an accountant from north Florida who asked for a leave of absence and got it. She got her name from the wings she put on her shoes...very clever. It was nice to have someone to talk to and share the shelter with. I worked on my blog and went fast asleep soon after I lay my head down.","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540063,"I woke later than normal today, about 6:15am and I started by stretching my body which I do every morning. Mercury got up right after me and the way we moved showed that neither of us seemed to be in a hurry. Mercury is determined to get to New Jersey, about 20 miles from here. I would like to get to the Delaware Water Gap which is about 19 miles away. My getting there was going to depend on the terrain and my feet. All of a sudden Chicken Feet showed up along with Optimistic Dreamer and Baby Chicken who I have not seen since Woods Hole Hostel. Gung Ho was there also. He started in Harper's Ferry and will flip flop. That means that he will start in Harper's Ferry and go North to Katadin, Maine then return to Harpers Ferry and go south to Springer Mtn, Georgia. There are quite a few hikers who do this to avoid the crowds who go from one end to the other.They ate breakfast and we all got reunited and acquainted with the new hiker in the group, Mercury. We all started hiking together and Mercury was in front of the pack. I have a feeling I won't see her again because she is doing a lot of miles. Do I even have to mention that the trail was rocky? I don't think so!!!! The soles of my feet started to hurt by late morning especially my left one. Not sure if I should blame the rocks or my new shoes. Since everyone is complaining of foot pain, I blame the rocks. A lot of the shelter log entries mention the rocks on the trail and not in a positive way. We are all ready for New Jersey! I took a couple of breaks that I don't normally take so that I could rest my feet. I only traveled 13.8 by the time I got to Kirkridge Shelter but it seemed like forever! To top it off it started raining about 1 mile before I got there. Chicken Feet, Yardsale, a brother and sister from Buffalo NY, and myself all stayed the night at the shelter. It started pouring around 6:30pm. We all got settled in and by 8pm we were all asleep.","Leroy Smith Shelter

Chicken Feet did not want to get up. He is usually the first to get going but not this morning. It was comical watching and listening to him. Our goal was to get to the Delaware Water Gap for breakfast, 6.4 miles. It had rained all night and I slept well, but my foot pain was still there.The going was slow for me especially in the rain and with the rocks. Since my goal was food it made the pain more tolerable.  As I was coming into town I could see the Delaware River and the bridge that we will cross to get into New Jersey. Wow! So close but I will not cross it until tomorrow. I decided to stay in town at the church hostel to give my foot a rest. I went to the hostel first, grabbed a bunk, and dropped my pack off. First stop was the bakery where they are supposed to have good breakfasts. I'm met up with the brother and sister, then Yardsale and Chicken Feet finally joined us. After breakfast which was great, I went to the outfitter and bought a bug net to go over my head and some new insoles to give my feet more padding/support. I hope they help. The bug net should help with the gnats while I am hiking. Chicken Feet and Yardsale decided to hike on while I stayed and took care of some housekeeping. I did my laundry and went to the post office to mail my malfunctioning trekking poles to the manufacturer to get fixed. I will have to do without them for a while longer. More hikers started coming in to the hostel. There are 8 bunks, 3 couches and tenting and a shelter out back. It was definitely enough space for the 20 hikers that are here. Crock is also staying here. It is good to see that she is doing well now. We got a ride to Walmart to resupply then we went our separate ways. My dinner date tonight was with Allen who is 69 and the brother sister team. We all had chicken wings for dinner and spent time talking. It is really nice meeting new people and learning about them...where they are from, about their families and their lives. I miss all the hikers I've hiked with and I think of them all the time. I hope they are well. I am still in touch with most of them so I am able to know how they are doing on the trail. Back at the hostel many of the hikers are up and having a good time talking. I called my wife and tried to plan what we will do and where we will stay when she comes up on the 30th. It will be so good to see her and spend time together on the trail.

I started hiking at 7:30am. Legs and Blister (two sisters) started just before me. I crossed the Delaware River bridge and stopped in the middle to bask in the wonderful delight of crossing the state line into New Jersey! I have been looking forward to this moment. I would love to have stayed there longer but I had to hike on. I caught up with the sisters and hiked with them for a mile until we got water from a stream. I took a break and they moved on. The hike was next to a stream and was very pretty. So pretty that I didn't pay attention to the blaze and I took a wrong turn. It only took me about 5 minutes to realize that there weren't any blazes on the trail I was following so I returned and got on the right trail. Oh well...it happens. New Jersey did not greet me well. The path got rockier and rockier. New Jersey has rocks too! Although it continued to be rocky, the views were spectacular! I walked a ridge line that had constant views and was so beautiful. Sunfish Pond was very pretty. Even a snake was enjoying it while sunning on a rock. The water in the pond is acidic and only a few species of fish can live in it. I also saw a beaver dam on the north end. This beaver has been busy. 
My feet were feeling better and that is probably because I didn't do many miles yesterday and because I have new insoles. The more I walked on the rocks today though, the more sore they became. There was a rocky summit to Kittatinny Mountain. Again the views were amazing. My plan was to stay at Rattlesnake Spring campground but nobody was there when I got there so I hiked on. The hiking seemed long at this point. My feet wanted a break but I kept going passing a swampy area with a pond that had lots of lillipads in it. I finally came up on what I thought was a campsite but again, nobody was there but I set up anyway. I have never camped by myself but I was ready to do just that when Whitecap and Braids along with their dog Sitka showed up and joined me. Whew! The evening started getting cool. It is supposed to get down to the 50's tonight. It was nice sitting and talking to my fellow hikers. They really are an interesting couple, Whitecap and Braids.

I heard Whitecap and Braids stirring so I went ahead and got up. Breakfast was first on my list then I started packing up. My fellow campers left about 20 minutes before I did. I was not in any hurry to make miles today. Yvonne flew into NY last night and stayed with her sister. She was driving out to meet me in the afternoon. I was going to cross many roads so it was easy to pick one for her to meet me at depending on her arrival time. The morning was beautiful and the path was forgiving at the beginning. It was not long before the rocks slowed me down. My feet were a little better and I was in great spirits but when you are repeatedly walking on rocks your feet definitely feel it. I came up on a great view at Rattlesnake Mountain and later I took the 0.2 side trail to Brink Shelter for a rest and water resupply. It was a nice shelter...new and clean. I was the only one there and it was peaceful. In many places like this it makes you feel like just staying and laying down a while and relaxing but it would really slow me down if I acted on all of my feelings like that. I continued on and stopped for lunch next to the trail on a boulder. I usually look for a log or boulder to sit on to have lunch as it is much more comfortable than sitting on the ground. Crocs passed while I was sitting. She was going to the next shelter to get settled and then take a 1 mile side trail to a lake to go swimming. That sounded enticing but I passed on that. I made my way up the trail and Joker caught up to me. We hiked together and had a couple of nice views. We came up on a fire tower that was locked so we were not able to climb it. When I arrived at Gren Anderson Shelter Croc was there and Whitecap and Braids came in shortly afterwards. The shelter was big and the area was very serene. We had a great time just relaxing and laughing about different things. Yvonne called and said she would arrive at 5pm and it was only 3:15 so I decided to meet her at Sunrise Mountain only 2.4 miles ahead. I had already hiked 14+ miles so I stayed until 4 pm before I started hiking again. Crocs and Joker were going to hike to the lake for a swim and Whitecap and Braids planned to leave shortly after me and hike 4 more miles. When I arrived at the Sunrise Mtn parking lot I was greeted with another nice view. I sat at a picnic table enjoying the view and waited for Yvonne. It is really nice to have family come for a visit. I envy the hikers who live on the East Coast and are able to get off the trail for a couple of days to visit family or family and friends come out to spend time with them. I can't complain too much since I did have friends from DC come out for a couple of days to hike with me and I have and will get off the trail to visit family. Yvonne was a sight for sore eyes when she arrived. I got off the bench like an old man, well I am an old man, but an even older one who is out of shape! I greeted my wife with a BIG hug and kiss! I was so happy to see her. She even brought me a DQ Blizzard! We sat for a while then set off to scout a couple of places for trail magic tomorrow. We found a good spot at the High Point State Park Headquarters. It was time to check in to the hotel and take a shower. It is sooooo nice to take a shower and put on clean clothes. Dimmick restaurant was recommended to us so we went into the Milford PA, yes back in Pennsylvania, for dinner. The restaurant was in an old home with a large wrap around porch. We sat at a table on the porch and it was perfect. Dinner, red wine and Yvonne in a nice setting. It doesn't get any better on the trail!!!","Campsite at 1310.1

We ate very well filling up for a good start on today's hike/activities. The plan was for Yvonne to drop me off where she picked me up yesterday and possibly transport Joker to town so that he could resupply and maybe get new boots. We arrived at Sunrise Mountain at 8am and Joker was there. I introduced him to Yvonne then got on my way. Joker decided to take it easy today and ride with Yvonne and help her set up for trail magic. We all have days that we just don't feel like hiking. It is important to listen to your body sometimes. Yvonne went to set up her trail magic at the park headquarters that we had checked out yesterday. It was going to take me around 3 hours to get to where she set up about 9 miles down the trail. The hike of course was rocky. One good thing is that the rocks seem to be getting further apart so I have choices on where I place my feet. The trail is definitely getting to be easier to maneuver through. I carried a very light pack today since I did not have to carry my gear in it. With only essentials and water, it weighed maybe 10 lbs and felt so light. I was slackpacking. It felt like I was flying on the trail with less weight. It was wonderful. I could get used to this. The hike had many ups and downs but none were too drawn out. There was a mixture of rocky and smooth trails and many times the trail came out of the woods to a scenic overlook. When I am hiking in the woods and I see a clearing in the distance where I know there is an overlook, I get an anxious feeling. Anticipation gets to me. I never get tired of beautiful overlooks that look out onto rivers, lakes, forests or towns. I passed a couple of shelters and made it to my destination, 8.9 miles, in 3 hrs and 5 minutes. Yvonne was set up in the parking lot and there were a few hikers there enjoying cold sodas, chips, pizza, snack bars and sweets. Most hikers sat and stayed awhile and Joker kept her company the entire time.

The forecast is for no rain and a high of 77 so it should be a good hiking day. Yvonne and I had a healthy (as in filling) breakfast at the hotel and drove to where we did trail magic yesterday. My plan was to hike up to the 220' High Point Monument atop the highest point in New Jersey which we could access via a 0.3 mile side trail off the AT, then Yvonne would hike back to the car while I continue on.We met up with a Ridge Runner before we started. He is one of the people hired by the State who takes care of the trail for a designated area. I had met him yesterday at one of the shelters I passed by. He gave us some good information about the hike up today. The rocks were on the trail right at the beginning and then there was a steep climb. That broke Yvonne in right away!  We finally reached the side trail that goes to the High Point Monument. On the way up, we got a few great views of this miniature Washington Monument. It looked like it was out of the middle ages. When we arrived at the base we were able to see some clear views of the surrounding area. The Monument was actually open for anybody who wanted to climb the 291 steps to the top and since I am always up for a challenge and Yvonne is a good sport, off we went. The hardest part of the whole day's hike was climbing those stairs. The views would have been much better but the windows at the top were fogged over with condensation. That was a little disappointing but we were able to see where we came from and a few towns in the distance. When we got downstairs, Yvonne decided not to hike back to the car but continue on with me. I was happy for her company but I was concerned about her knee. She has been having problems with her knee for 10+ years, has bone on bone and in fact, she is going to get her knee replaced soon. We consulted the AT book to see where the next opportunity would be for her to leave the trail then we went on our way.We visited High Point Shelter just so that she could see an actual shelter. There wasn't anybody there but I decided to take a break and do my daily ritual of exercising, push ups and stretching. The trail went in and out of some farmlands, wheat fields and grazing land. There were fewer rocks on the trail which was a relief. We hiked a total of 6.4 miles, which included the side trails, before we called a shuttle service to take Yvonne back to the car. It was still early in the day and Yvonne wanted to be a trail angel again so she went to set up trail magic further up the trail and I hiked on so I could meet her there.It was nice having Yvonne with me. We talked about different things and just enjoyed the nature around us. The hiking was pretty flat this afternoon with some small ups and downs. There were a few foot bridges over some creeks and a couple of swampy areas full of vegetation. When I arrived to where Yvonne was set up, there were 4 hikers there, Legs, Verge, Blanco and Kactus. We stood around for a while and talked about the trail among other things. It was still early, 3pm.

The hike began with a steep climb but I was thankful that it was not too long. I had a good view off Pochuck Mountain. After about 3 miles I crossed a road and entered a swamp/wetlands area where I walked mostly on boardwalks for about a 2 miles. There were many day hikers in the area enjoying the long weekend and the nice weather. As I came out of the area, I crossed another road and headed up a steep climb in an area called the 'Stairway to Heaven'. This was a challenging climb. Near the top there was a side trail to a beautiful vista on top of some boulders. When I say boulders, it is not always round rocks that I am talking about. They could just be some big slab of rocks that you can easily stand on unless they are at a slant which they are at times. I stayed for a bit to enjoy the views along with many day hikers. Todays hike had many rocks and crossed many roads, paved and unpaved. 
Finally, I saw a bear! I saw him before he saw me so I inched closer to get a picture. When he saw me he took off running for a ways then stopped and looked at me then he just walked out of site. Along the hike I came across a couple of trail magics left on the trail near a road crossing, there was an ice chest with drinks and snacks. On the second trail magic a lady was there replenishing the drinks. I helped her carry things from her car and struck up a conversation with her to find out what her story was. She is the mother of a through hiker who is about 5 days behind me and she leaves trail magic in this area because it is close to her house. Some ladies from her church also make cookies and snacks for her to bring as well. I thanked her and let her know that all her generosity is very much appreciated by the hikers. 
I continued on and reached Yvonne. After resting and cooling down for a few minutes we packed up and left for Yvonne's sister's house in the Bronx NY. 
The first order of business was to get a shower. That always feels so good after coming off the trail. 
Here is Yvonne's account of today...
I woke up with my calves feeling a little tight. Quite honestly I was surprised that my entire lower body was not in pain but I was very happy.
Oscar went off to hike this morning from where he left off yesterday so I was left to find my way to the meeting spot. I took my time as he was going to be at least four hours so I stopped at a supermarket and at a few stores to shop. Today’s meeting spot was going to be Wawayanda State Park but, unfortunately, when I got there at 10 a.m. it was filled to capacity so they were not letting any more cars come in. There goes that plan! I was hoping to do a ‘walk in the park’ before setting up at the trail head of the AT. Oscar and I had looked at a few possibilities so I went on ahead to the other areas. They were parking lots so they didn’t have the same draw as the state park. Needless to say, I had no problem parking there. 
There were not a lot of people on the trail today. My guess is that some had left for the holidays or decided not to do too much so they could celebrate the holidays where they were. That made for a very quiet trail magic day. It has been really nice meeting some of Oscar's trail family. It is nice to put the faces to the names. When I needed a break from the monotony I paced up and down the side of the road and then I left the cooler on the trail so that any hikers walking by would be able to help themselves to refreshments, and I took off in the car to drive around a little. 
I actually challenged myself to walk a little way down the trail to meet El Tejano when I anticipated that he would be coming up. I experimented by walking into the woods to see how far I could go and feel comfortable. It wasn’t far.
My calves got tighter and tighter as the day went on. Everytime I sat down it was harder to get up. When Oscar finally came, I actually had walked in a very short distance so I actually did meet him on the trail. I was ready to hit the road to visit my sister in New York. Tonight’s plan was to see Hamlet in a town’s performance of Shakespeare in the Park. The weather was going to be good for that.

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540714,"Yesterday I had my first experience with being a Trail Angel and it was fantastic. I had chips, brownies, scones, granola bars and a cooler full of sodas. Later on I ordered Pizza. The hikers were so happy to stop and partake. Many of them stayed quite a while and shared their stories on why they were on the trail and where they got their trail names from. Very interesting.
My plan was to come to New Jersey to meet Oscar and REALLY hike the Appalachian Trail this time. His plan was for me to come and hike a mile here or a mile there! I understand, he did not want me to slow him down and more importantly, he did not want my bum knee to hurt me more than it already does. I guess since I have been nursing a bad knee for 10 years I really haven't pushed myself often but since setting my knee replacement surgery date, I am more willing to push myself a little more than normal. I have to admit that running and walking are not my favorite things to do but, since I cannot participate in the sport that I really love, (Netball) I have had to resort to doing a lot of walking over the last 10 years.
So this morning, we set out for me to join El Tejano for a hike then when I was done, he would hike on. In my mind I was thinking 5-6 miles. In his mind I could hike a mile and a half and then turn around and walk back by myself. He obviously was not thinking right. Me, walk through the woods by myself! No Sirree!! I am the person who flinches at every little sound I hear in the bushes next to me. I think not. On our hike this morning knowing how I am, and being the person that he is, he walked behind me and kept throwing stones in the bushes while he watched my head swing from one side to the other. Yes, it was funny when I found out what was really happening. I guess I have been looking at all of his photos and thinking about the snakes that he almost stepped on or the bears that he has seen at a not so far distance. I was on my toes for sure. In fact, when we started out, one of the first questions I asked is, ""Is there a possibility of seeing snakes in this area?"" Of course his answer was very hesitant and he kind of sort of said possibly. I knew what that meant. Feeling brave, I decided I was going to lead the hike but at times I had to let him lead. Those were generally the times where if I slipped on a decline, I wanted to fall on him. 
My hike today totaled 6.4 miles when you include the hike to the High Point shelter and also to the High Point Monument, the highest point in New Jersey. It looks like a miniature Washington Monument. When you include the 291 steps that we walked to the top and back you may as well say I walked 6 1/2 miles. That is not shabby! You have to remember that this is not just a walk in the park, this is a walk on the trail under canopies of trees and over logs and rocks and ups and downs in meadows and wheat fields and bridges and gaps and roads and streams. It was definitely a walk in the woods.
I would say that I am relatively fit as I exercise with some regularity. The walk to the High Point Monument got me winded though. Very winded! It was .3 mile on a steep uphill climb to get there. Then we climbed all 291 steps to get up to the top. I was having second thoughts by the time I got to step 150 as the heat was most definitely at the top and we could feel the temperature rise as we went up. By the time we got back to the bottom, my legs were wobbly. I think I am going to be in trouble tomorrow.
The shelter is what I expected it to look like but seeing it in real life made it so clear how the shelters serve the basic amenity of providing cover. There were no bells and whistles just a broom and a hardwood triple king sized bed that could hold maybe 8 hikers comfortably.
We didn't meet many hikers along the way. There were a few going southbound but we didn't catch up to anybody and nobody passed us going northbound. I kind of expected to see more people on the trail.
On one hand I can see how somebody would like to be out here. It is great walking in the countryside with the flowers and trees, the fresh air and the fields. The liberation of moving as fast or slow as you feel and stopping when you want to are all attractive. I mentioned in a previous post that there is no daily stress from work etc and there is no need to wear a watch. On the other hand walking in the woods even with company is very scary to the likes of me. The possibility of bears or snakes, to name two of the fearless creatures, sneaking up on me is nerve wracking. When we walked the rocky section we truly had to keep looking down to make sure we did not trip or stub our toes. Even though I was looking down I stubbed my toes many times. Thank goodness I had real hiking boots so I didn't feel anything. Oscar and many other seasoned hikers still do that a few times a day so I didn't feel bad. Why would somebody want to hike the trail when you have to look down so much, you have to walk alone so often, you get rained on sometimes, you end up smelling something awful after not showering for a few days, you get blisters and sore feet, you are carrying around 30+ lbs on your back and you have to set up house and break down house almost every day to name a few cons. I can't wrap my head around that but then again, people can't wrap there head around the fact that I look into peoples mouths daily (well, I used to).
I was rewarded on the rest of the trail as it was relatively level in most places after the shelter. One of the things that I had the pleasure of doing is using the open aired bathroom in the wild complete with fresh air, lots of light, a beautiful view, and toilet paper from Oscar's backpack! My body only had to do #1. Whew! Fortunately there weren't many hikers on the trail. I was lucky that my need occurred after my legs had recovered from the hike to the tower. 
Officially I walked 5.6 miles of the Appalachian trail today. The side trips don't count as part of the trail. We reached Gemmer Road and called a shuttle to take me back to where we started. I felt really good but I didn't want to go further then regret it tomorrow. I went to do some Trail magic after that at an area that El Tejano and I both agreed on. That was about 7 more miles on the trail for him. It was a quiet day in terms of trail magic possibly because it was after lunch. A few hikers came by but they had just eaten. I helped out 5 hikers and they all signed my book with messages about the magic they received. This is really such a neat thing to do. They are all so appreciative to receive something as little as a cold soda. I had lots of snacks too.
Oscar got there a few hours later and we went off to enjoy the rest of the day. Dinner, a movie and a good nights sleep at the hotel sounds good. I have a few more days left. I will let you know how they go.

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541088,"Today was a well-deserved zero day for me. We slept in by my standards but it was not very late at all, around 7:30am. We are going to spend the day with family starting with Yvonne’s son, Vincent, who lives in NY. Her other sister and her family were having a Barbecue at their home in NJ. The food was spectacular and the company was great! I did much of nothing today. Sat around, ate and chatted with family and friends. The question I get most from family and friends is, what has been the hardest part of this trip? As I have touched on it before it has been the commitment away from family/home. The physical part I can adjust to like doing a short day, taking breaks or going slow, the weather is a challenge at times but I adjust to it. I really miss spending time with my wife on the regular day to day things we do, Things I don't reall think about at home but out on the trail I do, and I miss them. When my son Gabriel sends me a picture of my grandson Noah, I wish I could just pick him up and play with him. Simply put I miss my life! The 5/6 month commitment is tooooooo long and one I will not make again for any venture. Tomorrow I will be back on the trail.Happy Independence Day.","Longhouse Drive/Brady Road

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541092,"FYI, I have asked Yvonne to write this blog up until the time we separated in the evening. We are back on the trail today! Oscar and I really took our time in getting out and to the trail. We left my sister’s home around 9am and had to travel about an hour to get back to the trailhead. Along the way we stopped at Goldberg’s bagels and had the most delicious bagels that we have had in a long time. In preparation for our hike today I took some ibuprofen. My calves were feeling much better but I thought it would be best to get them feeling a lot better so as not to slow me down. We had to decide what the plan was going to be. Option one was for me to hike to the highest point on the AT in New York which was about 2.6 miles in and then walk back by myself. Not happening! Option two was for me to hike to the highest point on the AT in New York and then Oscar would walk back with me. Possibly but I would hate for him to retrace his steps for such a long distance. Option three was for me to hike to the highest point on the AT in New York and continue on with Oscar until the next road crossing which was about 8 miles in. The third choice won. Before we hit the trail we left our cooler with sodas at the trailhead along with a bag of candy and a trash bag. It would be interesting to see how many partook of our Trail Magic when we returned.  We set off on our trek to NY 17A, close to Bellvale, NY and it was some trek. I kind of knew it was going to be because of the warning in the AT guidebook. It said, “Despite the unimposing (elevation) profile, rocks, abrupt ups and downs make this section challenging.” Challenging it was. The AT Guidebook shows the Elevation throughout the trail and for this section it looked relatively straight, flat. That had to work in our favor even with the warning. There was one area where our path went over what could be the back of a sitting elephant. It was that high, curved, and very smooth. We had to find just the right place to hold on to with our hands and step onto with our feet to get over it. There was another part with a ladder, steel placed into the rocks, for us to climb up with. There were many more hairy sections but the bottom line is that we made it through all of them.Before we headed out Oscar said, “You are not going to walk 8 miles.” I said I can try but truthfully, I actually believed his statement too. I was going to give it my best. On the entire trail we saw 5 people. 1 hiker was resting. Another two were on a walk from one of the side trails (they had no equipment with them) and the other two we saw right at the end of our hike walking southbound. The wildlife highlight from today was the snake we saw curled up on a rock enjoying the sun. I am glad that Oscar was leading the hike at that point. As we approached to pass, it slithered under the rocks. There were so many boulders today. Big grey, curved and sometimes slippery boulders. I had my one fall about halfway through the trail on a slippery rock. Fortunately it was not a long way down and I was able to laugh at myself. ? Towards the end I was actually feeling like I was ready to stop. My calves made it through without the burn actually going away. It seems like the ibuprofen had no effect and I took 800 mg! It took us about 4.5 hours to complete the 8.1 miles with minimal rest stops.By the end of the hike my fitbit was awarding me with so many badges for walking the most flights of steps ever, 125, and having the most steps in one day, 24000!! Oscar was great company and a great guide. He was as cool, calm, and collected as he always is and I believe that he was as surprised as I was that I actually made it through.Once we reached NY 17 we called a taxi to take us back to the car. We picked up the cooler that we left and were happy to see that several hikers had helped themselves to the refreshments. Before parting ways we had dinner at a restaurant in downtown Warwick, NY. It was a quaint little town. Oscar resupplied, donned his backpack for the first time in 5 days, and set out up the trail to the next shelter. I know that he is going to miss slackpacking.If I can do it, so can many of you. It is quite an experience. I would urge anyone who is thinking of and possibly hesitating about joining El Tejano to give it a try. Oscar would love to have company!. I plan to go back at least twice before he is finished in September. I have finished out the blog up until I left Oscar today. Check back for the rest of the blog from El Tejano. 
It was only a 2.1 mile hike to Wildcat shelter, got a very nice view from Cat Rocks outlook. Knowing that I will not see my wife for another 3 weeks is not fun. I really enjoyed her time with me on the trail. I am already looking forward to her return. I decided to stay in the shelter since I got in late, after 7pm. There were a few tents around, one belonged to Backscratcher and Can Do, had a short talk with them and set up my sleeping area. My pad deflated after a while, after an inspection I found a puncture hole. Slept without it and it was not comfortable, it was not a good nites sleep. Will have to try to patch tomorrow.","Longhouse Drive/Brady Road

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541093,"I woke early since I wasn't getting a good night's sleep. The weather was humid and warm with no wind. It was miserable. On the positive side, I got an early start at 6am. The hike today was probably one of the most challenging to my body. It must have been the heat and humidity but the trail had a lot of steep up and downs also. I got many nice views from the top of hills and I entered Harriman State Park which was pretty. The terrain in NY has fewer trees along the trail and many bushy areas. Some bushes were only 2 feet tall so you can see further into the woods. The highlight was the Lemon Squeezer area. It had a challenging rock filled climb to get to it then I went under a big rock like I was entering a cave. I came out the other end then walked into a narrow trail between two rock faces. I could n't make it with my pack on so I had to take it off and throw it on top of one side. Two hikers came after me and one took off his pack while the other was determined to make it with the pack on. After some 'squeezing' he did! A few short feet away there was another climb where I had to take my pack off again and put it on top of the rocks before I climbed it. There was even a bypass trail with a sign that said ""Easy Way"". There were many more rocks and steep climbs and descents. I was so drained that I wasn't sure I would make it to the shelter but I did. I walked 19.6 miles in 12 hours. That was very slow and my body was spent. I do not remember being this tired in a long time. I had to find a nice tent spot with no rocks because I have not been able to fix my pad. I need to find a new one but I will not be near an outfitter until about 4 days from now. I am looking forward to some good rest tonight.","Wildcat Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541186,"I had a much needed good nights sleep. I still don't have a pad but the ground was not too hard. When I left the camp at 7am it was warm and muggy already. I felt rested today..I felt so much better than yesterday. The hike out of camp was straight up. It got my heart beating right away! I climbed up Black Mountain where on a clear day you can see NY City. It was too hazy in the distance but the views were wonderful anyway. It was going to be another hot and humid day. It did not take long for my energy to start leaving me because the ups and downs started taking their toll. I took a lot of breaks today. The view from West Mountain was great. I could see the Lookout Tower on Bear Mountain, my next mountain to climb. Going up Bear Mountain was tough. It was 1.8 miles of up! I had to take about 3 breaks on that climb. For one stop I saw a deer grazing. He saw me but he did not seem phased by my presence. On another break Optimistic Dreamer and Gung Ho asked if I had extra water. I did n't have too much but I shared it with them because they looked like they were in bad shape. They took a wrong turn early in the day and got lost. That put them 3 hrs out of the way! It is easy not to pay attention to the blazes but it is dangerous. We hiked to the top together where we all bought Gatorade or Cokes from the vending machines. That was nice and refreshing. I walked to the Lookout tower but it was locked...bummer! I took some pictures from up there and also on the way down. So far NY has been very tough to hike but the views are spectacular. I made my way down off the mountain and arrived at a recreational area with a lake, pool, concessions, pavilions and a zoo. I had lunch with Optimistic Dreamer and Gung Ho then continued on.  I went a little ways and ran into Aurora and Conundrum. I hadn't seen them in over a week. I learned it was Conundrums birthday. Happy Birthday fellow hiker! They will be heading out tomorrow so I will probably see them on the trail. I left them and followed the trail. It actually goes through the zoo! Now how cool is that! I took my time and walked through the zoo reading everything. It was not very big but it was pleasant to walk through. The Bear cage is actually the lowest point of the Appalachian Trail 124'. I had called the Stony Point Center which is a religious based convention center. They have simple rooms with shared baths, breakfast included, and dinner is an option. That was going to be my home for tonight. They picked me up at the Bear Mountain Bridge then we ventured 20 minutes down the road to pick up 4 more hikers. It had been threatening to rain for a while and it started coming down right when we got to the hikers. Great timing. I knew one of the hikers, SpongeBob. He is a retired physician from Hawaii. I am not really sure if Doctors ever retire! It was good to meet up with him again as we talked about where other hikers were. We arrived at the center and I was happy to be able to wash my clothes, catch up on my blog, and have dinner with SpongeBob, his wife and two friends who are all down to hike with him for a week. There were about 50 teenagers there too. This must be a retreat for them. SpongeBob thinks this is the place where his parents came 58 years ago to train to be missionaries before going to Africa. He will have to find out. Dinner was all you can eat cafeteria style and it was fantastic and filling. I will try to fix my pad tonight, I hope the patch holds.

I decided to slackpack today since my pad is still not fixed. Hopefully the patch I put on this morning will work. I will find out when I get back. Sponge Bob, his wife Paulette, Jan and Scott decided to slackpack also. They will climb Bear Mountain. I got dropped off at a little past 9:30am and got going. The walk over Bear Mountain Bridge was really cool with the view of the Hudson below and Bear Mountain behind. This area is very pretty. Once I got into the woods it was a quite a hike up! I climbed from 198' to 727' in 0.5 miles. There were some rocks and again more ups and downs but nothing too bad. There were some nice spots where the trail had very few rocks so I was able to avoid walking on them. I made it to the Appalachian Deli just before noon. Most hikers stop there and have something to eat and resupply. I got a chicken wrap and it was pretty good. Optimistic Dreamer, Gung Ho, Backscratcher and Can Do where there, and Aurora and Conundrum came soon after. We sat and talked with some people there while resting and catching up. The hike was pretty much the same as in the morning. The only view I had was at Denning Hill. There was no ridgeline to walk, it was just a walk in the woods. The water has been scarce in NY so you really have to plan on where you are going to fill up. There was a water faucet at the Deli which I filled up at. I met Toiling Midget (no she is not a midget). She was picking something from the shrubs off the trail. I asked what she was doing. She was picking wild blueberries That were smaller than the store bought ones but they were very good. I picked some and snacked. It was threatening to rain since 3pm but thank goodness it hasn't. The wind picked up and the sun was behind the clouds. I got to Dennytown Rd at 4:30pm and waited for my ride. My pack only weighed about 10 lbs, and I was still tired. The heat and humidity are really zapping my energy. When I arrived I saw Scott and he invited me to drink some hard lemonade with them before dinner. I accepted and met them at the lounge by our rooms. We all sat around and talked about the day and the people we met. It is always good to unwind with fellow hikers. I went to my room and aired up my pad and laid on it, it seems to be holding air ok, Great! I will leave it aired up through the night and see how it does.

I packed up and took the shuttle to the trailhead and said my goodbyes to Sponge Bob, Paulette, Jan and Scott. I did enjoy their company and hope to hike with Sponge Bob in the near future. Today's hike was not a difficult one. I think the weather had a lot to do with my feeling that way. It was in the upper 70's and overcast and although it was humid, it was not too hot. After a while I climbed Shenandoah Mountain and was rewarded with beautiful views. There was a US flag painted on top of the rock as a 9/11 memorial...very cool. There weren't many other views but it was enjoyable hiking on some rock free paths. It started raining just when I got to a campground. There was a large shack with a carport which gave me cover until I decided what I wanted to do. After about 45 minutes the rain stopped and I decided to keep going to reach the RHP Shelter. If there is space there I will stay. When I arrived there were many people there but there was one space so I grabbed it!! This was the weekend that local volunteers come to do trail maintenance and the RHP is the headquarters. I passed a crew earlier who were making rock steps which is a very slow process. I hope to come back in the years to come and help with trail maintenance. There were a few hikers who had been here all day helping with the maintenance and there were some others, like myself, who just arrived. They kept coming in. One of the volunteers was a section hiker I had met about 6 weeks ago. It is good to meet up with him again. It is always good to see familiar faces. They were cooking hamburgers and hot dogs for us. I ate 2 of each and I was not full. Later they cooked some pork and corn so I had that too. Well, I had to have dessert and after that I was full!! After all the work ceased, we all sat around and talked. There are about 20 people here and they were all good company.   They said there would be blueberry pancakes in the morning.

I got up and out by 7:15am. The weather was a little overcast and it was humid and in the upper 70's. The trail was not difficult today. There were some rocky spots but for the most part it was manageable. There was a view coming out of the woods that looked like a postcard. Through the trees I could see that there was a barn in the distance. I took a photograph but it does not do it justice. There were some day hikers out and many had foreign accents. I met a lady from Ecuador and a group of five from Nepal. I talked to them all and they are just amazed at what through hikers are doing. They almost could not understand it just like some people I know . It sounds crazy when you tell someone you are walking over 2000 miles and living out of you backpack! I was planning on staying at Telephone Pioneer Shelter, but when I got there the creek was dry and I needed water. I ha to continue on to the AT RR station where there is a deli 0.6 miles down the road. I dislike those extra miles but a deli that allows camping!!!!! It was a no brainer! I got there and Optimistic Dreamer and Gung Ho were there. I set up and got me a Philly Cheese steak and fries. It was big and good! I felt really good today mentally and physically. It rained most of the day but it wasn't pouring. That helped to keep the heat down. I will be in Connecticut tomorrow where I am hoping to reach Kent, CT and go to the outfitter to buy a new pad.

I had sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, and orange juice...just what I needed. Gung Ho and another hiker said they did not sleep well because of the noise from the trains passing by. I hated to tell them that I slept great but I did! Yvonne suggested that I wear ear plugs and that worked perfectly. Today I hope to hike 18 miles to a shelter then go into Kent to the outfitter and buy a new pad. I started at 7am and the weather was sunny but overcast and in the low 70's. It is interesting that no day is like the other on the trail. You never really know if you are going to be walking in fields or forests. Today I started with a scenic walk through a series of fields then I went into the woods. The trail was smooth and again I had some hills to climb but it was not tough. Wiley Shelter is where I stopped for a break. This was my last stop in New York before entering Connecticut. Wow...another state completed! 9 states down and 5 to go. Yesterday I met this couple who were section hiking and came up on them again today. They are from Pennsylvania and will finish hiking NY today, so now they have finished Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York on the AT. They plan on doing 2 weeks per year until they finish the whole thing. I saw some groups of boys and girls hiking today. One was a Jewish group and their leaders were actually from Israel. The other group of girls were a Poconos camp and this was their 2 day hike. Yesterday I met a young lady from Israel who was section hiking for 2 weeks then she will go to visit her dad in Houston. It is really a small world. I hiked along the Ten Mile River. Now that was a great hike! I had lunch along the river while I laid out my tent to dry. It threatened to rain a few times today but when it did, we didn't get much. After lunch I came up on a couple of views so I stayed a bit on both locations so I could enjoy taking in the scenery. I saw quite a few nice homes down there. I wonder if they know that someone is admiring their property? The hike had been great until just before the lookouts. Leading up to the shelter, the rocks on the ground started showing up again and there were some steep climbs. It was slow going on the way down these mountains. I reached Mt Algo Shelter at 4:30p, claimed my spot in the shelter and left for town. It was 0.3 miles to the road then 0.8 to town. I called for a shuttle from the outfitter to pick me up. Guess what? The outfitter had no pads! I couldn't believe it. Another night of sleeping on a hard bed! They had a small deli there so I ate and got shuttled back to the shelter. I took my stuff out of the shelter and pitched my tent. The ground is softer than the wooden floor of the shelter. I moved on to plan B. Yvonne is going to order a pad and have it delivered to me two days down the trail. Now I wish I had acted on plan B a few days ago. Who would have guessed an outfitter would not have pads? NONE!!I ended the night how I have on many occasions...socializing with the hikers. Jarhead, Woody, Bougie, Sailor Jerry, Shadow Fox, Yukon and father son section hikers sat around the shelter talking until dark.","Appalachian Trail Railway

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541893,"It got a little cool last night. Without a pad and no down on the bottom of my sleeping bag, there was no insulation to guard from the cold from the ground. I put on my down jacket in the middle of the night as it got into the 50's. My sleep was okay but not great. I started down the trail at 6:50am. While sleeping in the 50's is not perfect walking is! Of course, it was in the 70's by 9am. It was rocky and steep coming out of camp then I had a steep climb. There were a lot of steep ups and downs today! I had a nice view on Calebs Peak and at the top of St Johns Ledges. I took a break at the latter admiring the views. A day hiker came up and struck up a conversation with me. He was a retired geologist and worked with National Geographic as a hiking guide. He said an outfitter takes care of all logistics and he just goes as a guide and educates the hikers on various things. He goes on 6 trips a year to Utah and Hawaii! Sounds like a dream job to me and he agreed!   When we parted ways I started down the ledges and boy was it steep! There were big rocks and it seemed like they went straight down so I had to use my hands a lot. It was fun and exciting. I made it through, and came to a path next to Housatonic River. It was a long and flat hike with the river to my right. That was very pretty and scenic. I would love to jog through there some time. I hiked about 3 miles on a nice flat trail then the steep hills started again for the next 5 miles. The downhills were tough on my right knee. Without my poles there is a lot of pressure on my knees. Hope to get my poles back soon. I hiked with Aurora and Conundrum. We are always catching up to each other better known as 'leap frogging' on the trail. I got to West Cornwall Rd where I had arranged a ride to the Bearded Woods Hostel where I will stay for 2 nights and slack pack tomorrow. There were only 2 other hikers at the hostel. One was Hong Kong Steve who I have not seen since May. He always hiked with Freight Train and Sparky but they got off the trail in Harper's Ferry. Steve is great to talk to. It will be nice catching up with him later.I took a refreshing shower and hand washed a couple of items.

I slept well but I touched poison ivy so now I have spots on my right calf that were itching me last night. The best thing about last night was that I got to sleep on a mattress!Hong Kong Steve and I left the hostel at 7am. The trail was very steep today. It was pretty much like yesterday. We went through another gap between two slabs of rocks that was pretty tight. Steve and I had different paces so we decided to meet in Salisbury as I moved on ahead. The canopy was thick in the woods making it dark and eerie on the trail. I was thinking this would be a good place for bears, but there were no bears. Lately I have only been seeing chipmunks and squirrels in abundance. I also see a couple of deer a day...mostly running away. At Hang Glider View I saw Bougie there. We sat and took a snack break. A little ways down the trail I came upon some teenagers doing trail maintenance. They were part of a group that did service projects. They had built some stone steps and did a good job. I came out into a field at Falls Village CT, walked on a couple of roads and crossed a couple of bridges over Housatonic River, the same river as yesterday. The trail entered the woods and came up along the river for about a mile, then there was Great Falls, a pretty water fall that fell about 60 feet. I spent some time there enjoying the sound and view then decided to have lunch as well. It was a great spot to rest. I had a long climb up Mt Prospect then down to the road leading to Salisbury. There was a market in town where I saw Jake and Taylor (brother and sister). They had some good food at the market so I bought some macaroni salad and olives and joined a few other hikers outside. I waited there until Hong Kong Steve arrived. We got our ride back to the hostel and picked up another couple of hikers on the way. Backscratcher and Can Do were at the hostel when we arrived. It is Can Do's birthday and Backscratcher arranged a surprise birthday party for her. We are having BBQ then a big dessert! I can hardly wait!Never a dull moment on the trail","West Cornwall Road

I was slack packing again so we took a long drive to the starting location. The forecast is for rain this afternoon and I am hoping to finish before it comes down. Everyone who stayed at the hostel slack packed today. Steve and I went north and are heading south to Salisbury while everyone else is doing what we did yesterday. There were 3 big climbs today the first, Mt Everett and second Mt Race were back to back right near the beginning. When we got to the top there were no views because of the low hanging clouds! That was dissappointing. I walked a ridge line with cliffs but there still wasn't a view. I couldn't even see the bottom of the drop off. It was very humid and wet and slippery. I fell twice going downhill on flat rocks. Fortunately I didn't get hurt. It was hard to get traction on the wet rocks. Since I was going south, I saw many hikers I knew but a few I had not seen before.Oh, in case you are wondering, dinner was great last night. We had bbq chicken and sausage, grilled corn, cornbread, cabbage, salad and dessert. We indulged after singing happy birthday to Can Do of course! The menu for dinner tonight is a surprise. Our instructions from Big Lou was to bring an appetite! That will not be a problem! The third climb was to Bear Mtn. There was a lot of hand usage going up because of the slippery rocks. Again, I made it without any mishaps. I am glad I am going south and climbing it instead of going north and descending it! It would have been much harder. On the other side coming down was not hard and it was all mostly downhill to town. When I walked into town I conveniently found a baker and hung out there until Steve arrived. Salisbury is an old town that incorporated in the 1700's. There are some very nice old style homes and absolutely no chain stores. It has kept its old charm but it is an expensive community. Once everybody made it in, Lou picked us up. We all had the same thoughts...we were wondering what the surprise was going to be for dinner. Waterfall and Treebeard were at the hostel when we got there. We were all happy when at the table we learned that it was the 5th annual hiker Thanksgiving Dinner! The spread included a turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and all the trimmings with pumpkin pie. It was great!!!!!

As usual, I enjoyed the company of my fellow hikers but it was time to say my goodbyes. No doubt I will be seeing some of them again. Hong Kong Steve and I were heading to Great Barrington so we set off together around 9am. Steve's plan is to stay there overnight and my plan is to go to the post office to collect my package (my sleeping pad) then hike out again. It was about 7 miles to town and mostly downhill. Going downhill is hard on my knees but easier than going uphill. I had a really good view at Jug End. The problem with the hike was that there were some really steep and rocky sections. That made the hike today really slow going. I didn't really care for those sections but that is 'par for the course'. When I got to MA 7 road I waited for Steve and we got a shuttle into town. Many hikers try to shuttle together to share the cost. As you can imagine, we do not carry much cash with us on the trail and you can only use a credit card in certain situations. I will always be a foodie so our first stop was lunch. We went to a Thai restaurant (yum yum). The post office was our next stop. Steve got a package but mine did not arrive. I called the company and there was a problem with the mailing address so it was not sent...bummer! I gave them a new address and had it sent 3 days ahead. I have slept without a pad for this long so a few more days won't hurt I guess. I resupplied a little then hitch hiked back to the trail head. That was a good break even with my disappointment.I started hiking at 2:40pm on a trail that was mostly uphill for the first 4.5 miles. It was not a bad hike. I had a nice view on top then I hiked 3 more miles to the Tom Leonard Shelter. I made good time getting in at 6:15 pm and there were only about 5 hikers camping there. I found a good spot for my tent, took care of all my chores, and lay in my tent at 8:30. The bugs were bad all day and worse at the shelter.I have gotten so far but I have to say that I am really feeling like packing up and going home. I miss home. I miss my life the way it was. I really miss my family. I can see why hikers quit after going this far. I have to change my mindset and focus on finishing.

I started at 6:30am so that I could cover the 21 mile hike to Upper Goose Pond Cabin. There is a pond that we can swim in there, bunks with mattresses and a pancake breakfast again! Those things were incentives for me to walk all those miles. The hike was up and down with some rocks then it got a little easier. I had some really nice views especially those when I was coming out of the woods into a clearing with farmland in the distance. I don't get those views at home so I savor them. There were really cool looking woods today. One part was eerie looking and another section looked magical with green moss covered boulders...very pretty. The past couple of days I have been feeling homesick. It is making my hikes very long. I am getting the attitude that I need to hurry up and finish so I can go home. I am losing that excitement of being on the trail but somehow I need to get it back. Maybe I need a zero in a cool town or something like that. Just 2 more weeks before Yvonne comes up for a visit, I am looking forward to that. I was wanting to do a lot of miles before she gets here but with the way I am feeling, I'm not so sure I will.The cabin is pretty cool. The bunks are all upstairs, about 16, and there is tenting also. It overlooks the pond which is more like a small lake and they have canoes that we can use. I was so happy to get a bunk since I don't have my pad for my sleeping bag! I got my bunk and went straight to the pond to have a swim. It felt great. The water was clear and not cold at all. A guy docked a canoe and he had about 16 bluegill fish. He was going to clean and fry them up for us. I ate my dinner and then ate the fish when they were ready. They tasted very good! Fresh fish are the best.  Moose and Raw came in. They are cousins that I had met early on in my adventure. I hadn't seen them in about 6 weeks, I caught up with them and talked about the times we had together. Good memories! Lots of hikers were here tonight...most of them I know.

The combination of the woods and the pond and the sereneness of it all is so calming. Pancakes were on the menu for breakfast. We ate heartily and sat around and chatted before making our way to the trail. One by one the hikers started leaving. I was one of the last to leave getting on the trail at 10:15am. I felt good physically and mentally...much better than yesterday! It was not a bad hike until I hit the rocky areas. I just had to be careful. It was humid so there were many wet, muddy areas and lots of footbridges to cross those muddy, swampy areas. I didn't have many views, just a couple. We are hiking at low elevations right now and don't get back up high for a few days. I am looking forward to hiking higher up for two reasons... it will be less humid and there will be cooler weather!!!! I arrived at Kay Woods Shelter at 7 pm after a long but good day. Unfortunately there weren't any soft ground tent sites so I stayed in the shelter. The bunks were hard there but at least they weren't bumpy like the ground was.

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542818,"I didn't sleep that well partly because of the hard wood bunk but also because a couple of hikers came in late and their dog was very active and barking. I got an early start at 7am and arrived in Dalton, MA an hour later. There was the usual gathering of hikers at the restaurant. We all hung around charging our phones while we enjoyed a very good breakfast. My plan was to hike 10 more miles to another town and have a late lunch. I like crossing towns and being able to eat real food! Crossing towns allows me to carry less food and less weight!!!! After lunch, I planned to hike to the next shelter which was 3/4 of the way up Mt Greylock. After leaving Dalton, it was uphill for the first 5 miles. Fortunately it was not too steep though. I passed a couple of ponds and I stopped at one to have a snack while enjoying the view. It was very humid and there were plenty of muddy areas. The forecast was for rain this afternoon. Little did we know what was in store for us. I hiked up to The Cobbles, an outcropping of rocks which gives you views of Cheshire and Mt Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts. I could see the bad weather coming while I was up there and I could hear thunder in the distance. My footsteps quickened because I wanted to avoid getting rained on. Meanwhile, the sound of the clapping thunder was getting closer. The wind started blowing hard and it got darker. I stopped to put the rain cover on my backpack and put my rain gear on but, it came so fast that I was drenched by the time I got everything on. It was like a hurricane coming in very fast. The path became a creek. Trees and branches were coming down all around me then to top it off, it started hailing! They were small pieces but I could feel them hitting my head. I had to go around the trees that were falling in my path and blocking the trail. The storm came upon us quickly and it stopped just as quickly. It probably lasted 15-20 minutes. I got into Cheshire just as the rain stopped. This is one of those towns where the trail goes right through the town. The town was hit hard by the storm. Trees were down and utility lines were also in the street. A tree fell on a house and you could see the hole in the roof. It was just wild! It is hard to explain the feeling inside me as it was all going on...excitement, fear, fun, all mixed together! I talked to some of the locals as I walked down the street and they'd never seen anything like that. I reached the post office where some of the hikers I've camped with were gathered. I had a package in the post office! Woo hoo! No, it wasn't my pad...that is due in tomorrow. Yvonne sent my new hiking poles and some snacks.It was supposed to rain some more late in the afternoon so I decided to stay in town. I took a city bus to another small town though, Pittsfield, and got a hotel room. A good shower and dinner was what I needed. I ran into a Brother and Sister hiker team at dinner. We keep running into each other which is typical for through hikers. In any case, I told them to quit following me! We had a good laugh about that. I hand washed my clothes and settled in with the TV for the evening. Hopefully I will get my new pad tomorrow before I hit the trail. I am not planning on leaving early.

I had a good evening yesterday. I stayed up late watching a couple of movies. Since I didn't plan on leaving early I didn't mind relaxing a bit. My pad arrived and the Cookie Lady is going to shuttle it to me and drop me off at the trail head. The Cookie Lady is a legend on the trail. Her house is 100 yards off the trail and she always has homemade cookies for the hikers. You can rest at her house in her comfy chairs and fill up with water. She has a blueberry patch that hikers are welcome to pick also. She has been doing this for many years. 
My pack is heavier since I resupplied last night. I was out of food and I definitely can't go on without food. Things have really changed since the beginning. I used to carry about a week's supply of food and slowly, the amount I carry has dwindled. Now, I plan on carrying no more than 3 days supply of food to keep my pack weight down. I am probably at 29 lbs right now which is great. 
I took care of a couple of blisters that were forming on the outside heel of both feet. I busted them, cleaned them up, then taped them this morning. They felt better right away but the real test was a few miles into the trail. It passed the test! Today I climbed Mt Greylock, the highest point on the trail in MA, a climb of 2100 ft in 7 miles. The hike was not too strenuous and I did not have any views until I reached the top. Bad on Lodge is at the top of the mountain. I stopped in and had a burger for a late lunch. The views of the surrounding area were spectacular. As I started my hike again I went in a pine forest and the scent of pine needles was fantastic! The smell stayed with me for most of the hike which mostly downhill. I arrived at Wilbur Clearing Shelter at 5:30 pm where there were a few renters and 2 in the shelter. Waterfall and Treebeard arrived soon after me and decided to stay in shelter as well. We all ate together and and talked about the trail.

What down must come up so it figures that it was followed by a 2000 ft climb in 3 miles. It was not that difficult but later in the hike my legs were very fatigued. It made the last couple of miles really long! Today's hike was not very scenic. I was in the woods under a thick canopy and the sun hardly made it through the thick vegetation. I walked through North Adams town and to exit the town the trail went up someone's driveway before entering the woods! It was pretty cool.

I can't seem to satisfy my hunger! That last mile down to the road was very steep so I worked up a good appetite. I got a ride right away from a local guy and he started talking and did not stop until he dropped me off! He covered some of his life, the locals, drugs and the weather! He was quite a character.

When I reached the top I was rewarded with amazing 360 views of the surrounding area from a fire tower on the summit. It was Benton Mackaye's dream to build the Appalachian Trail. It was the summit of Stratton Mtn where he was inspired to fulfill that dream. I took a side trail to a Gondola at the top of Stratton ski area and I walked all the way down under the gondola to the resort where Yvonne had reserved a room for me.

That went down well.My plan before I knew that Sergio was coming was to go to the Green Mtn Hostel and I had already made reservations. We headed to the hostel after lunch and met the owner. He showed us around and then we headed into Manchester Center. We visited an outfitter then a grocery store to resupply a little. I expected some of my trail family at the hostel this evening so I wasn't surprised when we got back to see that more hikers had come in including Aurora and Conundrum. There are 3 rooms upstairs with a total of 7 beds. We all sat in our room and talked for a couple of hours. Our conversations gave Sergio an idea of trail life with all the stories we were telling.

There was a big steep climb with large rocks to the Bakers Peak and the views were fantastic. 
I ran into Faye and Mary whom I met a couple of months ago. They were section hiking south through Vermont. They had sent me an email of their plans so I was hoping to cross their path. The last 4 miles were mostly along a creek with nice cascades. The pretty scenery always makes the hike nicer. It drizzled just before I got to the shelter around 4pm but it stopped soon after. I stayed in the shelter with 3 Long Trail hikers, Nar Nar, Vanilla Ice, and Mac & Cheese. The Long Trail is the oldest hiking path in the country. It is all in Vermont and goes from the Massachusetts border to the Canadian border for 273 miles. The first 105 miles from the Massachusetts border follows the Appalachian Trail. I may come back and finish the Long Trail one day. 
The pond at the shelter was very inviting. Nar Nar and I waded in and sat down. There were lots of rocks in it so it was hard to walk but the dip was very refreshing. After that I did my usual housekeeping to get set up in the shelter. There is a group of 3 young ladies who are sisters and are section hiking. All of us sat, ate dinner and talked about the day and our plans for tomorrow. This camp site has a caretaker and it costs $5 to stay. It is worth it because the shelter is nice and clean.

I climbed Bear Mtn for some nice views then made it to VT 103 where I hiked 0.5 mile down the road for a restaurant! Extra miles are worth it for good food. Nobo Lobo was there already so I joined him. I met him earlier today while hiking. He is from Mexico but has lived in the USA for many years. This is one of the few times on the trail that I could have a conversation in Spanish. I enjoyed talking Spanish with him. A fish sandwich and hamburger plus 3 glasses of tea is just what I needed. Nar Nar, Vanilla Ice and Mac & Cheese arrived shortly after I ate. We decided to hike to the second shelter which is 7 more miles for a total of 19.7. I hiked back to the trail head and was greeted with 2 steep uphill climbs. After that it was pretty smooth hiking all the way to Governor Clement shelter. I pitched my tent by 4 section hikers. They were set up and had a fire going. Nar Nar, Vanilla Ice, Mac & Cheese, Brah and I joined them around the fire while we ate dinner. We had great hiking conversations and some laughs. It was a nice ending to a long day.","Little Rock Pond Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544138,"I slept really well but did not get out of my sleeping bag until about an hour after I woke, 6:30am. I took my time in getting my things all packed up and got to hiking at 7:45. There had been a big group of campers near the shelter that I thought were part of a hiking club but, they were actually a trail maintenance group. I saw them on the trail working about 15 minutes into my hike. I wonder how much worse the trail would be without their efforts. Ooooh, I don't want to think about it. It seems like every morning that I get on the trail there is a climb. Today was no different, 2000 ft in 3.5 miles, arriving at Cooper Lodge Shelter. From the shelter there was a side trail of 0.2 miles to the top of Killington Peak for views and another small hike to the top of the gondola and ski lodge/restaurant. While I was resting at Cooper Lodge shelter, Nar Nar and Vanilla Ice arrived. They said it was worth the climb so I left my backpack and climbed up. It was very very steep and of course rocky. In this case the rocks help because they give me a place for my hands and feet. My fellow hikers were right...it was a great view. It was clear and I could see forever. I met a couple of girls who had accents and I thought they were from Europe. They were actually from Quebec! I have met a couple of other hikers from there and they had very strong accents too. I didn't realize that they spoke French there. I need to visit that area in the future. I went ahead and hiked to the ski area and went into the restaurant. It was very pretty in there with chairs and couches to sit on. I could see the peaks I had hiked over...these were views of the other side of Killington Peak. The climb down to the shelter was just as tricky as the climb up. I had to get on my butt a couple of times! I'm glad I left my pack at the shelter. Brah and the 4 section hikers were there resting when I got back. I spoke to them for a bit and got on my way. Now I was going downhill. It was a mixture of steep, rocky, and nice trails. The roots are starting to be very ubiquitous on the trail as well. (That one is for you Pauline). If it's not one thing it's another!!!! I decided I wanted to take a shower and wash my clothes as everything, including me, was starting to smell worse than normal! I booked a room at Mountain Lodge by Kent Pond. Boy, was I looking forward to that. I stopped at another shelter to rest and saw Brah, Nar Nar and Vanilla Ice there. Since Nar Nar and Vanilla Ice are doing the Long Trail, we will part ways today. Their plan is to hitchhike into Rutland and spend the night there. They are students in college and have the youthful energy that my body lost a few years ago. (Just a few years  ). I enjoyed their company. I hiked a few miles further and arrived at the lodge and found it to be a great place to relax. It overlooks the pond and has well manicured grounds. They gave the hikers free pasta salad. Food is definitely a good way to lure me in! I met Sunshine, Moonshine and Barnum...we were the only hikers there. A shower and clean clothes felt great. I am sure that those around me appreciated that too! We all ordered pizza and indulged at the honor bar. Red wine was perfect! We sat, ate, drank and talked in one of the lounging areas. They had a TV room there so I went and watched a movie. I Went to sleep at midnight but I did a lot of relaxing this afternoon. No doubt I will sleep well.","Governor Clement Shelter

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544141,"My late night slowed me down this morning. I visited with the other hikers, had breakfast and finally got to hiking at 9:30am. I wasn't sure how far I would go but I had to keep in mind that it was supposed to start raining at 2pm. I hoped that I would get to where I was going to stay by then. The trail did not have many rocks today but it had a lot of exposed roots. It was a nice trail that went up and down a lot. There weren't many views at all. I like to see waterfalls so I decided to take a side trail to Thundering Falls. I was so disappointed when I got there because there was no thundering going on...it was dry! Oh well. I ran into Aurora and Conundrum when I took a break. Later I came up on Disco and her mom who came to hike with her for a few days. I saw them off and on until I arrived at a cabin and tower where I planned to stay the night. It started raining before I reached my destination at about 3pm. Since I was under the canopy of the trees it wasn't bad. Arrived at my home for the night, the Lookout, at 4:15pm. It was a large cabin with a ladder going to the top with a lookout perch. The views were 360 degrees and I could see Killington Mtn ski area where I was yesterday. Brah was there and Aurora and Conundrum came in later along with a few other hikers. The rain stopped a little after I arrived. Later we tried to see the sunset but it was too cloudy at that time. As time passed it cleared a little and the northwestern sky turned shades of red and blue...it was beautiful. There were 4 of us up there enjoying the view. This is another reason why I hike, to see views like that. It was a good spot. There are 10 hikers in the cabin and there is still room for more.Tomorrow Yvonne will arrive for a 4 day visit and I am really looking forward to seeing her. It is supposed to storm on the east coast tomorrow morning and the airlines are already saying that they may cancel flights. I hope there are no delays with her flight.   Time to sleep.","Kent Pond

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544197,"One of the benefits of waking up early is that I can see the sunrise. It is such a beautiful experience but I don't get to do it often enough. This morning I went up to the lookout at 5:15am to watch the sunrise but it turned out to be too cloudy. The sky turned a nice shade of blue but the view is not what I was hoping for. I will have to try again another day. I layed back down to rest for a while then got up and headed out after breakfast. Since there was no water at the lookout, I had to take in enough water yesterday. I had just about exhausted what I had so I needed to stop and get water first thing this morning. I stopped at the first shelter for a break and much needed water and I ran into Disco and her mom as they were coming out of the shelter. They pointed me in the right direction to get water. It's a good thing too because the creek was dry by the shelter. Disco told me to keep going down the stream and I would find some puddles which I did. It's a scary thought to be out of water.The forecast was for rain from noon on but I am hoping that it will hold off until I meet Yvonne this evening. Today's hike was great weatherwise. The sky was overcast with a little breeze. It was still a little hot but the trail condition was fantastic! There were very few rocks and roots and the ground lended itself to a very soft trail. There were some steep ascents and descents but I will not complain. My feet are happy.  I met Teradactyl and Sachajoia on the trail today and we kept leap frogging each other. They are not hiking together but are both from New Hampshire. I got up to a lookout and saw a wild raspberry patch. I stayed up there a while picking and eating them while enjoying the view. They were good and sweet. I could have stayed longer but I'm sure I ate more than enough. I ran into some good trail magic right by the place where Yvonne and I were supposed to meet. There was an ice chest of goodies and water for hikers. I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, banana and some cookies. Since I was a little early, I stayed a while and visited with other hikers. Brah, Aurora, Conundrum, Teradactyl, Sachajoia and a couple of south bounders all sat and enjoyed the snacks. After about an hour I walked down the road to the Cloudland Market to wait for my wife, Yvonne. They let me sit on the porch which was very comfy. Yvonne arrived and I will tell you that she is the best shuttle driver I could ask for. LOL! I love my wife! We drove back to Killington through some of the most beautiful countryside in the USA. Vermont has a law that does not allow billboards. That really enhances the beauty of the countryside. It makes me want to buy a home here. It's just beautiful. We arrived at our B&B and immediately set out to dinner at The Foundry. That was an excellent spot! Another great day!","The Lookout

This B&B had all you can eat pancakes and I got 3 blueberry pancakes and 3 banana pancakes that were made with fresh fruit and were fluffy and tasty. Bacon and country potatoes came with it. That got us started just right for the full day that I had planned.
Yvonne and I went back to Stratton Mtn so that I could make up a 14 mile section I skipped when my brother came in. We went up the Gondola and hiked the 1 mile to the lookout tower and the AT. After some viewing, we hiked north on the trail. Yvonne went back after a bit and went back to the base lodge where she did some shopping and sight seeing. There was an outlet shopping center near to where she was going to pick me up in Manchester so she was very happy when I directed her there.
The trail was nice with very few rocks. It was mostly downhill and there were not many sights to see except for Stratton Pond which was pretty with the hills in the background. I did not see many hikers so it was quiet. I finished at 5:30pm and we headed back to Killington for dinner at an Italian restaurant called Garlics. The food was excellent! They gave us a roasted bulb of garlic and mashed it so the cloves came out and we mixed it with imported olive oil and parmesan cheese and dipped our bread in it. Mmmm, Mmmm,Mmmm. It was good to have a nice dinner with Yvonne. After dinner we went to the Inn and had some wine and relaxed. 
The plan for tomorrow is for Yvonne to take me back to the trail after we pack up. I will hike to Norwich/Hanover where we will stay for the next 2 nights and hopefully I will put another state behind me.","Cloudland Road

I woke up looking forward to having breakfast at the Inn today. I had a 3 egg meat omelet and again, it was fantastic. Yvonne and I have been impressed with the food in Vermont. It is fresh, well prepared and tasty.We checked out and Yvonne dropped me off at the trail head. Again, I need to mention that the drives we are taking through the Vermont countryside and through the small towns have been nothing short of amazing. Today, for most of the way, we were on a scenic byway road. It started raining last night and it has continued through to this morning. By the time I started hiking it was a slight drizzle and it lasted the whole hike but it was not muddy at all. There weren't a lot of rocks or roots to worry about either. That made for nice trails and easier hiking today. It made up for having no views. When I exited the woods in Norwich there was a mile walk on a back road. The houses are very pretty and well taken care of. The lawns and flower gardens are manicured and everything is very green. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont properties have been well kept and beautiful. Once I walked about a mile down the road I was in historic Norwich. I walked all the way to the Connecticut River Bridge where I crossed into New Hampshire!!!! Two more states to cross and 442 miles!

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544299,"As told by Yvonne...The plan we set last night was for both of us to hike then Oscar would continue on. Since some of the hike would have been on the streets of the town, I would have been okay backtracking by myself. The only problem was that the forecast was for rain all day and it seems like the forecasters were spot on. If it wasn't pouring, it was drizzling. After seeing the rain, Oscar decided early this morning that today was going to be another zero day and I was not unhappy! I don't mind hiking but it is cool and rainy weather and that is not my cup of tea. It turned out to be a very lazy day. Breakfast was followed by watching TV and reading and enjoying the porch at the Norwich Inn. As lunchtime approached, we ventured into the town of Hanover and did a little 'resupplying' and visited the outfitter to fix minor problems. We also got some ice to go with the drinks we already purchased in preparation for doing some trail magic later today. In fact, we met some hikers in the parking lot when we were putting ice on the drinks and invited them over for refreshments. They were very thankful.Jewel of India was our lunch spot today and as usual, there were hikers around. Oscar recognized a mother and daughter duo that he had seen on the trail. The mom was so petite...she could not have been over 5 feet tall. It was hard to imagine her lugging a backpack that was definitely going to be around half her size. I imagine that she and her daughter shared some items so that would make backpacking easier. After our delicious lunch we walked around the town for a little while but the rain was unrelenting so we got back to the car very soon. I can say that I actually hiked some of the trail today as the main roads of Hanover are actually part of the AT. Hanover is a college town. College towns tend to take on the color of the school so all you could see was a sea of dark green clothing representing Dartmouth College. This was parents weekend so there were a lot of visitors in town proudly wearing the school colors.We decided to set up our Trail Magic where Oscar is going to start out in the morrning. It was too rainy to sit outside waiting for hikers so we set it up a little way into the trail under the canopy of the trees and left it. When I drop Oscar off there in the morning I will pick up the trash. I walked into the trail a little bit and it was soooo pretty. We were actually at a tree farm so the trees were planted in neat rows. The needles from the pine trees had formed a bed on the ground so when you walked it felt like you were walking on a sponge. That has to feel great to hikers.","VT-NH Border

It was a bummer seeing her go, but I was so happy that she came.
The next time I see her I will be finished with my hike!!!! 
Natural light was minimal at 5:30am so I started out with my headlamp on. My goal was to reach the Fire Wardens Cabin on Smarts Mtn around 20+ miles away. The trail was nice this morning with few rocks and roots. It rained all night and continued this morning with a light drizzle. I wore my rain gear this morning and I didn't remove it until mid morning when the rain stopped. Even with all the rain the trail was muddy in very few spots. I came across Hong Kong Steve slack packing southbound. It seems like he is 1 day behind so I may see him again at the Hikers Hostel in Glencliff. 
I had some good climbs, not too difficult, and views to Moose Mtn South and Holts Ledge which had some cliffs with deep drop offs. It was very scary to look down! The climb to Smarts Mtn was very long with some tough rocks to maneuver on. I guess that made up for the easier earlier climb! At the top there was a fire tower which I climbed for some 360 degree views of the surrounding area. I never stop being in awe of nature. I didn't see many hikers today, I only talked to a couple of southbounders. The cabin was not very big and Jersey Girl, a southbounder, and I were the only ones in there. Jersey Girl is 67 and has had 2 hip replacements and a torn meniscus on one knee and she is out here!!! What a determined woman! She is section hiking to finish what she started in 2009. 
The cabin is like a big shed with some windows and a door. It is comforting to know that if it gets windy or rainy we will be out of it. I got in the sleeping bag st 7:30pm hoping to get some much needed sleep.","VT-NH Border

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544882,"I really slept well last night, 10 hours!! My body needed the rest. Jersey Girl and I left the cabin about the same time, 7:30am, but before hitting the trail, I climbed the fire tower again. The sun was behind the overcast sky but the view was pretty with the clouds below the distant mountains making for an eerie scene. Jersey girl is from somewhere near Atlantic City, NJ. When I passed her she told me that her husband may be doing trail magic on a road 10 miles into the day's hike. She asked me to let him know that she may not make it that far today. I agreed to convey the message, I bid her goodbye, and headed down Smarts Mtn. There were rocks and roots but they were spaced perfectly enough to be able to avoid them with most of my steps. Then came Cube Mtn. That was a steep climb with big flat slanted rocks near the top. There was no moving fast at times like this. There were some good views though. I could see Smarts Mtn and the fire tower on top of it. It's so cool to see where I came from. The descent was slow initially with many big slick rocks and boy was it steep! As I got further into the hike, the trail got better with fewer rocks and roots. My plan was to hike 20 miles to a hostel but if the trail was difficult and slowed me down, I would camp somewhere. Once the trail got easier, after Cube Mtn, I was determined to make it to the hostel for a bunk and shower. I held off eating lunch because I was almost to the spot that Ron, Jersey Girls husband, should have been doing trail magic...sure enough he was there. I stayed a while talking to him and resting. I saw Corn Cob and Cheetah who I had met weeks ago and I met Earnhart as I was leaving today. The remainder of my venture today was not too difficult so I was able to make good time. I was feeling really good mentally and physically. The break and visit from Yvonne was great and the 10 hours of sleep and rest last night was a big help in making me feel so good. There was a makeshift sign in the trail that read 'Welcome to the Whites'. Whites National Forest is a very rugged part of the Appalachian Trail but also the most scenic. Hikers call this mountain range the Whites and they have been talking about the Whites since I started the trail. It made me worried but also anxious to get here. They said if you have been doing 18/22 miles a day you will do 8/13 miles a day in the Whites! What makes it so difficult is the steepness of the trails. They go straight up and down instead of switchbacks on pretty level ground. They are characterized by having lots of rocks and boulders where in many areas you will have to put your poles away and use your hands to make your way up or down the mountain. The height of the mountains and the unpredictable weather are some of the many things that factor into my plans for the day. I keep a close watch on the weather to be sure I don't meet heavy rain when I reach the top. It is important to make my pack as light as possible or slack pack which I will plan to do as much as possible. I had a couple more good views before I finished the day's hike. It was a long day so I was happy to see the road where the hostel was. I hiked 0.3 miles to Hikers Welcome Hostel where I saw many familiar faces including Aurora, Conundrum, ET, and Firefox, Yukon and Beefcake. It was 5:30 pm which means that I covered 20 miles in 10 hours today. That is not bad for me. At the hostel they were starting to shuttle hikers to a deli. I caught the second trip and got 2 cheeseburgers and tea. When I got back I sat out with other hikers eating talking and laughing. After my shower I felt great! The hostel is a home with a common room attached where hikers congregate and it has an upstairs with bunks. They also built a new barn like structure next door with bunks inside, 9 beds downstairs and 15 upstairs, where I stayed. It was very comfy. I got into bed about 9:30pm and I am sure I was sleeping before 10.","Smarts mountain. Fire Wardens Cabin.

This is one of the things that I will miss when I go back home, seeing the stars without all of the artificial light interfering. I eventually went back inside and went to sleep and fortunately, when I woke at 6am I felt rested. I did my daily stretches and got ready for the day's hike.I along with other hikers were taken north and dropped off at the trailhead where we slack packed south over Mt Moosilauke and back to the hostel. But, first we had to get some energy so we had breakfast. For $5 I had bacon, eggs and pancakes. It was a good and necessary way to start the day. Aurora, Conundrum, Milty, Griz and I took the first shuttle and hit the ground running...not literaly. I think we all anticipated that the hike was going to be difficult so, mentally, we were ready. Our first challenge was to climb 3850 ft in 3.7 miles. The first mile was along a beautiful cascading waterfall. I think this will be a big picture day! We stopped at a small ledge for a view and wondered if the giant mountain we were looking at was Moosilauke. We were hoping that it wasn't but we later found out that it was!!! We climbed and climbed and summited to some beautiful 360 views. We were above the tree lines so we had unobstructed views. This is one of the times I enjoy daily...sitting and enjoying the views and the beauty while I eat, rest, and enjoy the company of other hikers. The phrase, 'Stop and smell the roses.' comes to mind. I am indeed smelling them. We could see the series of mountains in the Whites that we will be hiking. Mt Washington is the highest and there was no doubt which one that was. It looked daunting but I am eagerly waiting to get there. 
Now to go down 3800 ft in 5.5 miles! Most of the steep part was in the first 4 miles down. It was very tricky making sure that my foot placement was just right. I am so glad that I didn't have a back pack today. We came up on a wild blueberry patch shortly after starting down. They showed up just in time for dessert so we picked and ate a few...very tasty. The last part of the trail was smooth and we made some good time making it back to the hostel by 3 pm. Milty's knee was bothering him so he slowed down so as not to aggravate it. Hong Kong Steve was at the hostel when we arrived. It was good to see him. Of course, Steve had some red wine so we drank a couple of glasses and caught up with several other hikers. 
Tomorrow is definitely going to be a challenging day so I am getting in bed by 9 tonight to rest for tomorrow's long hike. I am not slack packing and am trying to make 16 miles in the Whites tomorrow. I may be asking a lot of my body but, it is supposed to storm on Saturday and I would like to be at a hostel by then.

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544949,"After laying down and debating it in my head for a long time, I decided to slack pack. Our host Legion, said it was a tough 16 miles and that we should take our packs with enough supples to last one night in case we could not make it back. If I took my pack I doubt I could make the 16 miles so I decided to slack pack. Going without my pack would give me added incentive to make it back! Our other host, Sweets, took my pack to Chet's Hostel, which is a little further up the trail, where I would stay tonight. Sweets dropped us off and we each had a plan, Griz was only going 12 miles and Aurora and Conundrum had their packs and would go to Chet's Hostel along with me. 
I got started at 8:15am and headed up. The first climb was to Wolf Mountain which was a tough morning climb with not much of a reward. I just saw one narrow view. I stopped at Eliza Brook Shelter for lunch, 7.5 miles into the hike, where I met 6 hikers there taking a break. I resupplied with water and left my lunch spot to find that the hike went next to a very nice cascading creek with small waterfalls. The trail was very challenging and if it rained a lot, some of the trail would be taken in by the creek! I would have to wade across! It was very challenging all the way up to Kinsman Mountain. Whether you're going up or down I don't know how we can hike this in the rain! It is supposed to rain tomorrow and if it does, I will definitely zero at the hostel in Lincoln NH. 
There are two peaks on Kinsman, north and south. I reached the South peak and the views were spectacular. It is great to be rewarded after a hard hike. One mile later I reached the north peak from there I could see Franconia Ridge which I should be climbing Sunday. I am hoping that the rain and clouds will be gone so I can see some of the views. I've been told that some of the best views of the Whites are from there. I started my 2,900 ft descent which would be completed in 4.6 miles. Some parts are steep and others really steep! Some big boulders had wooden steps placed into the rocks or metal rebarb. It definitely helped. Aurora and Conundrum walked with me most of the way down. They set the pace and I followed. We were all looking forward to some food and a shower. We arrived at 6:45pm. Yeah! We had to hike 1 more mile to the Flume Visitor Center to get picked up by a shuttle we had called. 
Chet's Hostel is at the shuttle driver's home. The garage and another room behind it served as the bunk room with 6 bunks, one bed and two couches. You can tent in the back too. The floor is used as overflow. I slept on the couch and there were 3 hikers on the floor. There was also a bathroom/shower and washer and dryer. We went to eat and none of us finished our food.

They were so filling that I didn't quite finish them. I needed to resupply so after breakfast I went to an outfitter then a grocery store. This was definitely a good day to go to the movie theater so, that's just what I did. I saw the Suicide Squad, my kind of entertainment. The movie was good and the popcorn and soda topped it off! There is a residence a few houses down from the hostel that is painted many different colors and it has very pretty flowers on the property. I went to take pictures and saw the owners outside. I had a little chat with them and complimented them on it all. Back at the hostel some of the hikers made hot dogs and I had one that was very good but, I still went to dinner with Aurora and Conundrum. We went to One Love Brewery, the same place we ate at yesterday, and I had a lobster sandwich with a local ale. I prepared myself and got my gear ready for tomorrow. I am feeling nervous and anxious about the next few days of hiking. There is going to be some difficult terrain and I will be carrying a full pack.

Brah, Disco, Griz and a few other hikers came in late yesterday. Brah was section hiking and this was it for him. It was nice hanging out with Brah and I hate to lose his company on the trail. Oh well. Aurora, Conundrum and I said our goodbyes to all, took a shuttle to the trailhead, and started hiking around 8am. The first climb was Little Haystack Mtn which was steep and rocky which, of course, made my progress very slow. To get to the mountain we followed the Franconia Ridge which also connects to other peaks. We were above the tree line for 2 miles so the views were great! The forecast called for rain about 1 pm and the clouds were rolling in. Being up above the tree line I could feel the wind blowing hard. I put on my rain jacket mostly to block the wind because it was getting chilly! 
Last night I deleted many pictures off my phone to make room for new ones and I'm glad I did because I took a lot of pictures today. After climbing the first peak I climbed Mount Lincoln then Mount Lafayette at 5263 ft. Lafayette was in the clouds but when I reached the top it was starting to clear but only for a few minutes. The views were incredible! I felt like I was on top of the world. I moved on and went down and up again to Mt Garfield for more wonderful views, I was even looking down at a ski resort in the distance. 
I am getting ready to hike through a section of the Whites called the Presidentials aptly named because each of the 13 mountains is named after a president. 9 of the mountains are considered 4000 footers. It is a 19 mile range in New Hampshire of which the tallest is Mount Washington at 6288 feet. The second tallest is Mount Adams. Do you see a pattern here? Actually it is noted that there was a surveying error and Mt. Madison and Mt. Monroe are in the wrong height order hence the wrong presidential order. Oh well. Mt Washington is known to have some of the strongest winds on the earth! Here's hoping that I don't get blown away!
All the ups and downs and making my way over the rocks has gotten my legs tired. With about .5 mile to go to Garfield Ridge campsite, it was all downhill, rocky, steep and slow. I finally reached and set up my tent. It is so rocky that they built wooden platforms to place our tents on. I couldn't stake my tent down and it was hard to put it up because of the wind. I had to get rocks to help to secure it as the wind was picking up and then it started raining a little. I must have looked comical.  It is supposed to get into the 30's tonight. It is 5:30 pm and I am laying down already! This is the first test in the cold for my new pad. Since it is better insulated than my old one I think I should be fine...so far so good. I hope my tent holds up in this wind!!!!","Franconio Notch

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545177,"It got very cold last night and it rained but I slept very well. I was in my tent for 13 hours and slept for probably 11 of those hours. I did not want to get out of my sleeping bag at all! It reminded me of when I was in the Smokies when it was cold and rainy every night. I motivated myself to get up and get going knowing I had a long journey to make across what might be described as treacherous terrain. I got off to a late start at 8:10am after getting a full supply of water. Initially, the trail was steep downhill with many large rocks but, it leveled for a while until the first climb to South Twin Mtn. It was steep and therefore I moved slowly. Just before it got really steep, I arrived at Galehead Hut. The Whites have a series of huts that can be described as nice and expensive hostels! They have triple bunks with kitchens and bathrooms but no showers though. Some huts can sleep 90 people...they are pretty big. They cost about $120 a night with breakfast and dinner included. Hikers can do work for stay which involves cleaning up after dinner and maybe some dishwashing then they can eat dinner and sleep on the dining room floor. They also have to clean up after breakfast and then they can eat breakfast. That's a good way to get free meals and an indoor place to sleep. When I got to the hut at 10am they had cornbread, cookies and coffee for sale. I ate 3 pieces of cornbread and a cookie and drank coffee that was cold and tasted awful! Not bad for $5 I guess. I also filled up with water.  There were good views when I got to the top of the South Mtn. It seems like the wind is constantly blowing on top! I kept leapfrogging Google, Littlefoot, Corn Cob, Cheetah and Taco most of the day. The rest of the hike was mostly downhill with some steep sections. Steepness equals move slowly for me.  I had some good views from Mt Guyot and a few other spots since I was walking on a ridge. After 10 miles I arrived at Zealand Falls Hut where there was a couple of nice little waterfalls. I had all you can eat potato dill soup and bread for $3. Now that was a great deal! I talked to some people that were staying there and some of them hike from hut to hut and stay the night at each one. To do that you have to make reservations well in advance to be sure that you have a spot. My other hiking friends arrived as well. I plan on going to Ethan Pond Campsite for a 14 mile day but they are going a couple of miles further. The trail for the next 4 miles was pretty flat and mostly very easy to walk on. That was quite a pleasant change. When I arrived at the campsite at 5 pm, Aurora and Conundrum were there already. Ethan Pond Campsite was like many others on the hike, very pretty and surrounded be green hills. After washing up, I sat on a rock by the pond for a while. It was very peaceful. I ate dinner and settled in for the night soon after. I lay down at 8pm but even though I was tired, I was not sleepy yet. It felt good to have my feet up and resting after another long day. Tomorrow the plan is to start climbing Mount Washington and stay in Lake of the Clouds Hut which has 6 bunks for thru hikers. I am hoping to get one but, if not, then maybe I can do work for stay. After all, I am very domesticated! The Hut is 1.5 miles before the summit. Mount Washington is the second highest peak on the AT and it has the highest recorded wind speed in the USA. The weather is very unpredictable up there, that is why I want to stay at the hut then summit the next morning...It is safer that way. I hope my plan works!","Garfield Ridge Campsite

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545273,"I was too cozy in my sleeping bag again and found it really hard to get going. I finally hit the trail at 7am. I could have gotten up earlier but oh well. The trail started very well, flat then downhill for a total of 3 miles. The easy start was a tease because it was up up up for the next 10 miles! Some of it was very challenging...I had to put my poles away and use my hands but I liked it...that was fun. Going uphill for that long takes a toll on my body. My legs were getting fatigued. The first peak today, Mt Webster, had a very pretty ridge walk leading to it with many views. I came up on Mt Jackson next and enjoyed lots of wonderful views of the surrounding mountains. The weather is cool and most of the huts appropriately have soup for a snack. I was ready for a break and had some soup at Mitzpah Spring Hut where I met up with my bubble of hikers. The trail went by but did not go over Mt Eisenhower and Mt Franklin. A lot of the trail was above the tree lines so I could see forever. It was nice to turn around at times and see where I had come from. I'm physically tired. My feet are sore due to all the rocks I stepped on and I was ready to stop! When I finally reached Lake of the Clouds Hut, they had room in the dungeon, and I was soooo happy. It is like a basement and is cold and small in there but, it is a place to rest so I will not complain. They had six bunks, triple deckers, and all six got taken by the end of the day. It really does feel like a dungeon in there! This hut has beautiful views and I can see Mt Washington. It looks close enough to touch but it's summit is 1.5 miles up. I think that hiking hut to hut could be a future family vacation. Hmmmm.
I stayed outside to see the sunset which was beautiful. I hope to get rested for the 15 mile hike tomorrow.","Ethan Pond Campsite

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545372,"We all woke early in the dungeon. It might be because I was anticipating summitting the famous Mt. Washington. We decided to leave extra early, at 6am, since we had a very challenging hike and the forecast called for rain in the afternoon. Aurora and Conundrum left 20 minutes before me and hiked up into the clouds where the summit was hidden. While I was climbing I looked back at the hut. It was a beautiful sight! What a great setting for the hut. I got to the summit in an hour and it was so foggy that I had a hard time finding the actual summit. I found the sign and took some pictures but it was hard to keep steady with the strong winds. I was all alone which made it a little eerie. It was cold and I needed to get moving but, it took me about 15 minutes to find the AT trail!! I have to say that I was a little worried until I finally found the way. Although Mt Washington is one of my milestones it was a little anti climatic since there weren't any views to behold. I headed down and was greeted with the expected tough hike. There was nothing but rocks, no trees and hardly any vegetation but plenty of rocks! I took a fall and hit my knee and a little later, noticed blood coming through my pants. I stopped to clean the wound and, fortunately, it wasn't too bad a cut. I had many slips today. The views all the way to Madison Hut where I planned on eating lunch, were very faint because of the clouds. It was a slow and tough hike to get to the hut but, I got there and had some potato dill soup and a cinnamon roll. Leaving the hut I was climbing Mt Madison. It was only half a mile but it was a very steep half mile. After the summit it was mostly downhill with a few small ups and, thanks to the rocks, I had to move so slowly that I did 4 miles in 3 hrs!!!! I needed to be at Pinkham Notch by 5pm to get picked up to go to the hostel that I made reservations for. This terrain is making it hard to reach that goal! Earlier I went by Mt Clay and Mt Jefferson but did not summit because the trail not go in that direction. After almost 11 hrs of hiking, I made it at 4:40pm to the pickup point. Talking about cutting it close! Aurora and Conundrum were there and so was Chicken Feet. I have not seen him since the Delaware Gap. It was good to reunite with him. He is staying somewhere else but I will see him again. I also saw McGoober who I haven't seen in a couple of weeks.
We were picked up promptly at 5 and when we reached our destination, White Mtn Hostel, we settled in. It was as I was told, clean and efficient. I put on loaner clothes and put all of my clothes in the bin for washing. I took a shower and got shuttled to Walmart for resupplying. My shopping list included wine and deli food to relax with...I needed that! The next two days I plan to hike a total of 21 miles then head back to this hostel which is further north than where I hiked to on the trail today. The last two days have been grueling...my feet need a break but I am not sure when they will get a real break.","Lake of the Clouds Hut

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545465,"Today is my 5 month anniversary on the trail. That's a long time to be away from my family and home. As much as I am enjoying this hike I miss home and I am ready to finish and go home. There are still some milestones that I am looking forward to like entering Maine, the last state, hiking the Mahoosuc mile, the hardest 1 mile stretch on the AT which takes hikers about 2 hours to complete, reaching 2000 miles, doing the 100 mile wilderness where you have to take enough food to get through that section then, of course, climbing Mt Katahdin for the finish. The hostel had a fantastic breakfast which got me energized for my hike today then I was shuttled back to Pinkham Notch to pick up where I left off. Today's hike started by my having to climb Wildcat Peak at 2060 ft in less than 2 miles. It was a climb! I put my poles in my backpack a couple of times to use my hands instead. I ran into Chicken feet and Papa Monkey on the way up, a couple of hikers I've hiked with in the past. Wildcat is also a ski mountain so we passed a Gondola which some day hikers take up and hike a little. The views on Wildcat were spectacular, I could see Mt Washington and Mt Madison where I hiked yesterday. They look so far away. Now to go down, it was just as steep and again sloooooow. Most hikers are amazed at how slowly they are going. I got warned about the Whites but I didn't fully understand until I experienced it! There were several mountains on the hike today besides Wildcat. I climbed Carter Dome, Mt Hight, Middle Carter Mtn and North Carter Mtn, then I hiked down to Imp Campsite. In between I had lunch at Carter Notch Hut which was in a beautiful location with a couple of ponds surrounding it. I arrived at the campsite at 7pm after 10.5 hrs of hiking and covering 13.1 miles...I was dead tired! More hikers came in, some in the dark, and we all felt the same, beaten down! It was a warm day and I'm sure that had some effect on us but it was still hard hiking. I am looking forward to a short day tomorrow, 8 miles and back to White Mtn Hostel.","Pinkham Notch

It was a bit deceiving in that when you though you were at the top, you saw another higher part, not real high but higher. That happened about five times then finally I started going downhill. The whole hike was only 8 miles and the last 3 miles were comparatively easier to hike. The last part also went next to Rattle River which was more of a large creek with rocks and boulders. We crossed it a couple of times by rock hopping and, believe me, you didn't want to slip off those rocks! I made it to the hostel at 11:30am, nice and early. I was happy that it was time for a shower and some rest. I still feel fatigued from the last 3 days and am toying with the idea of taking a day off but, I want to keep going.

It rained most of the night and was raining in the morning with more rain in the forecast all through tomorrow. I decided to zero. The hostel had one spot left for tonight so I jumped on it! I had another good breakfast which is included with the stay then just I just hung out in the hostel and watched the Olympics. I ventured out to the town for lunch and had some really good chowder. A bottle of wine seemed like it would go well with my relaxing evening so I picked one up, returned to the hostel, and continued watching more of the Olympics while arranging my supplies for tomorrow. Over half of the hikers in the hostel zeroed because of the rain and the difficulty of the previous days. I was very happy to be able to catch some Olympic events. In a normal Olympic year I would be attached to the TV. This is a nice place to relax with a good group of hikers. The rest of the night was spent watching Olympics with other hikers. If all goes as planned for the next few days, I will cross Into Maine, hike the Mahoosuc mile and Mahoosuc Arm, 2.4 miles of very hard and slow hiking. I am excited about that.

She was a wonderful hostess! Marni took Hong Kong Steve, 2 Pack and I to a trail that leads to the AT. The other hikers are slack packing back to the hostel and I am moving on north. 
The going was slow but not as slow as the past few days. There were some steep hikes but fortunately they were for a short distance. Mt Success had good views but it was overcast the whole day so what might have been magnificent views were mediocre because it was so hazy. When I got to the bottom of the mountain I hit the New Hampshire/Maine border and I met up on Cheetah, Mass, and Shaggy who were having lunch there. I joined them for lunch and stayed and relaxed a little while they hiked on. I came up on Cheetah and Mass again later in the hike at a very steep descent with big slick rocks. Cheetah was just sitting halfway down because she had fallen and was a little shaken up. When we fall with our packs on we have a lot of added momentum with the extra weight. It can be scary because we may want to control our fall more but it is difficult as the weight of the pack sometimes pulls us another way! Mass and I helped her down and we made our way to the nearest campground cutting our day a little short. It was early and I wasn't tired yet but it felt great to stop early. I had dinner with Mass and Cheetah who both had leg injuries but were doing well. Accidents will make you stop and think...We do not have to be in a hurry so we can take our time. I guess that because we are getting closer to the end we may want to hurry up and get done! We still have the hardest part of the trail coming up tomorrow and for that, we plan on leaving about 8am. We will most definitely take our time. I'm glad that Cheetah did not get physically hurt more than she did. I hope that she is mentally better tomorrow.

Cheetah, Mass and I did not get going until 8:20 am. We had climbs to Carlo Mtn and Goose Eye Mtn, no views cause we were in the clouds, it was a wet and humid morning, lots of rocks and steep ascents and descents. By the time we got to North Goose Eye Mtn some of the clouds had moved away and we were able to get some nice views. We arrived at Full Goose Shelter and had lunch, 4.4 miles in 4.5 hrs, 1 mile per hour, very slow but that's ok, we are trying to be safe given the wet rocks. We hiked 1.5 miles to the beginning of Mahoosuc Notch, the hardest mile on the AT. We arrived and believe me we knew we were there, huge boulders of all shapes and sizes, I put my poles away to use my hands instead. I usually hike alone but today Cheetah and Mass are my hiking partners, good thing too we can help each other especially when we take our packs off to squeeze between two slabs of rocks, we've lost weight but not that much! There were cave like spots that we explored in and actually found slabs of ice way at the bottom, now that was amazing. To be hiking an area I've heard about for 5 months is exhilarating, any fear I had of this stretch left me right away, this was FUN! We made through in 1 hour and 49 minutes, but could have done it closer to an hour, we were too busy exploring and enjoying it, not to make it sound easy, it wasn't but enjoying it made time fly by.  We stopped for water when we finished and decided to hike on 2.4 more miles to Speck Pond Shelter before calling it a day, but that meant we had a 1.5 mile climb up a very steep and rocky Mahoosuc Arm. We made to the campsite at 7 pm, 9.5 miles in 10.5 hours, very slow and long day, our first full day in Maine and this is how we are treated ha ha.

I had a short tough climb then a long downhill. This was enough to encourage me to have a short day because of my aching knees. I called the Cabin, a hostel run by Earl and his wife Honey, to see if they would pick me up at Grafton Notch. This very nice and accommodating couple has had the hostel in their private home for 22 years. Hopper, a former through hiker works there and picked me and 3 other hikers up.

I am so glad that I was not tenting in that weather. I felt a little tired in the morning but the breakfast made me feel better. My plan was to slack pack 10 miles and not feel worn out because of the lack of my backpack...or so I thought. I started my hike at 8:30am and fortunately the rain had stopped. It was a 4 mile hike up to Baldpste Mtn. My progress was slow because of the wet, rocky, and very slippery terrain. The higher I went, the more into the clouds I got. The top part was a bald that was above the tree line and had a lot of flat rock. The wind was blowing very hard and it was cold as well. I thought it was sleeting but it was the high wind blowing the rain sideways. I could tell there could have been some nice views but it was a whiteout. By the time I started going downhill, the trail was like a creek so I moved even slower. Cold, wet, and slippery...it was not fun!I arrived at a shelter and ate lunch. I can't believe that it took me 4 hrs to go 5.8 miles! The rest of the way was better though. Initially it was slow but I was able to pick up the pace with the nicer trail as the day went on. It was still overcast and this part of the trail was very still. There were no birds chirping, no squirrels or chipmunks. It was a little spooky. I finally got a view when the clouds rose. I arrived at Dunn Notch Falls which had a different type of crossing. I crossed over the falls at the top with the water falling beside me about 200 ft. It was very scary looking over. I called for a pickup from there and by the time I got to the road Honey was there waiting for me. I was very tired. It takes a lot of energy to fight your momentum going downhill especially when it is wet. The shower and wine was a welcome relief. I sat outside with Earl and had a drink.

The weather is pretty clear so hopefully I will get some good views. 
I was only hiking 10 miles today and I was hoping that the terrain wouldn't wear me out and make me very tired when I finished like it did yesterday. Well it didn't! For the start of my hiking day I climbed 1500 ft in 4.5 miles which wasn't too steep. The terrain was a mix of rocks, roots, and clear trail. The weather was mixed, overcast and sunny, but no rain and there were still a few places with standing water and mud left over from yesterday. A couple of miles into my hike I came upon Surplus Pond, another one of those picturesque spots in the middle of nowhere. There is supposed to be a moose that frequents the area but, it was not out when I was there. It would be nice to see a moose before I get off the trail. 
I arrived to the top of Wyman Mtn and had a clear view then I headed down to Hall Mtn Lean-to(shelter) where I had lunch. There were a couple of resident chipmunks who were not shy so I was able to take a couple of pictures. My next climb was a steep one to Moody Mtn where I stopped at a couple of viewing spots. During my hike I passed Disco and Mass who I will probably see in Rangeley in a couple of days since we are planning to stay at same hostel there. I made my way down the slope and crossed a couple of wide creeks that some hikers take their boots off to ford. I was able to move from rock to rock while using my poles for stabilization. Thanks to my excellent balancing skills I didn't fall in...that would not have been fun! When I got to the road, my ride, Hopper, was there waiting for me.

Chickenfeet will be hiking south for the day and he will be 1 day behind me. He told me he was going to slack pack as much as he could for the rest of the trip...he is tired. I got going at 7:40am and went uphill for 2.8 miles. Some parts were pretty steep and slow. Within the first mile I passed Mass who said he will only be doing 10 or 12 miles a day. Many hikers are slowing down, taking more zeros, and/or slack packing. They feel beat up from New Hampshire and the start of Maine. That is just how I feel.

Chris parked his car at the trail head and we went with Stacey for an hour drive going over a series of dirt/gravel roads until we reached our destination. The AT was not exactly where we were dropped off so we had to hike a little over a mile to the AT and started our hike. We went a little downhill before heading up to Saddleback Junior mountain. We stopped at a Lean-to and visited with three hikers who were there taking a break. Hiking south gives Chris an opportunity to meet some of my hiking friends who are hiking north. I crossed paths with Coldpack and Diesel who I haven't seen in 3 months. It was good to catch up with them. Another hiker named Elle was with them as well. I hope to meet up with them on the trail. All the north bound hikers we were passing told us we were in for some great views on the the ridge and they were not wrong. We climbed Saddleback Junior and had some pretty views then we went back down into the woods and up to the Horn Mtn for more views. Chris chose a good time to come because we had a 3 mile ridge walk above the tree line with constant views of the surrounding Maine countryside. Mountains after mountains were there as far as I could see. Chris was surprised at the abundance of water in Maine in the form of lakes, ponds, and streams. We topped our hike off with a gradual climb to Saddleback Mtn which is also a ski area. It was windy and cool for the whole ridge walk. We headed down into the trees again and stopped at Eddy Pond for water...that was a nice place to rest. Our hike brought us to another shelter where we visited with a couple of hikers again. The breaks help to break the monotony and give us a chance to 'smell the roses', socialize and recharge. After the last break we were ready to tackle our 1.5 to hike back to the car. We passed a few streams on that last stretch which were beautiful. Water in the form of lakes or waterfalls really add beauty to the trail. We hiked 15.7 AT miles today plus more non-AT miles! It was a good day. Even though it was a lot of miles for Chris to start with, he handled it well. We picked up a couple of hikers on the way to town. One was one of my hiker friends, Disco.

That was a nice change from the mundane breakfasts I have most days. To celebrate further we decided to take a zero and go sight seeing. Chris and I went to Smalls Falls which is a series of falls that crest swimming holes after each fall. It is very pretty there and since it was Sunday, there were many people out enjoying it. We chose a spot by one of the falls and sat and relaxed and talked. We both enjoyed the beauty and the downtime. There was a young guy, cliff jumping into one of the pools. It was pretty high. No thanks...my time for that is long gone! We explored the countryside via car and stopped at a country diner for lunch. While there we enjoyed more relaxation by taking our time to eat and watching the Olympics on their TV. As we headed back to Rangeley, the real estate genes we both possess made us drive around the lake and look at properties. Chris and I both dabble in real estate so why not. The lake was pretty and there were many nice houses for sale but no open houses.  I had to prepare for getting back on the trail so I went to the grocery store to resupply. The rest of the evening's events included dinner then a visit with some hikers at the Inn.

We picked up Obie1 and another hiker who were hitchhiking and took them to the AT trailhead. We also ran into Diesel, Coldpack and Elle. I will be half a day behind them so maybe I can catch them in a couple of days. We continued on to a dirt road and went in 4 miles until we reached a gate. That is where I started my hike and I said goodbye to Chris as he headed to the airport in Portland. It was good to have visited with him and I hate to see him go. I am anxious to get back on the trail and finish my adventure as I have renewed energy. Although the rain stopped, it was overcast and in the 50's. I hiked a half mile to get on the AT. The first climbs were to South Crocker then North Crocker and there were no views at all. The rest was downhill 5 miles to Stratton Road. I took a short lunch break once I reached the road then continued on for 6 more miles to Horns Pond Campsite. On the way I got a view of the Bigelows which I will climb tomorrow. I could also see the pond where the campsite is. It is always nice to have a view. One of my highlights from today is hitting the 2000 mile on the trail. What a fantastic feeling! I arrived at the campsite at 6pm and it was getting very cold. I got cleaned up and set up, changed clothes, ate and got water. Around 7pm I curled up in my sleeping bag to get warm. I did my nightly ritual of writing my blog and sorting through my pictures then went to sleep at 9pm. Another tiring day.","Lone Mountain

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547190,"It was soooo cold last night! I'm sure it got into the 30's but I still slept well. I got a late start because it was cold and I did not want to get out from under the warmth of my sleeping bag! My plan was to do 17 miles today but that quickly changed when I did the first 4 miles in 3 hours! It was very slow for me. I climbed to several peaks of the Bigelow mountains. The first peak was South Horn, then Bigelow west peak, Avery Peak and finally Little Bigelow. What got my legs tired was the steep downhill hikes. I was fighting the mountain the whole way trying to go slowly and save myself from some knee pain. The reward was that there were some fantastic views. This was Maine at its best! On one side I could see mountains including Sugarloaf ski area. On the other side were lakes with forest all around. I could also see where I hiked from and where I was going. I stopped many times just to gaze at the beauty. By the time I got to the lean-to at 3:30pm my legs had it. My mind wanted to keep going but my body said no! Leviticus and I were the only ones in the shelter. Qtip set up his tent and Mama Duck decided to continue on. Two section hikers heading southbound tented and they were a wealth of information since they had already hiked where I am heading. There were a couple of northbound section hikers here that I met yesterday at the other campsite. They have hiked the AT in sections for 19 and 16 years and they both plan on finishing next year. Bearsong and Squeeknee came into the shelter late. Tonight I have plenty of time to rest my body. I will try for 17 miles tomorrow. Maybe I'll get an earlier start. Tonight doesn't feel that it will get as cold as last night although it may get into the 40's. Some hikers have gathered in front of the shelter and made a fire. I haven't sat by a fire in a while. Nice.","Horns Pond Lean-to

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547200,"I slept very well! It did not get near as cold as it was the night before. It was probably in the mid 50's. I got up and got my self together early and was on the trail at 6:40am. It was a beautiful morning with a blood red sun as it rose. I haven't seen many of those. I had a couple of small climbs and descents that weren't very difficult. I was happy that the trail was much more forgiving today. I hiked right by East Flagstaff Lake, West Carry Pond and East Carry Pond. They were all so beautiful. The trails were actually very close to the water which made for a relaxing hike. The water made me want to jump in but since 17 miles is what I needed to accomplish today, I didn't linger. I experienced all different kinds of trails today but it was mostly flat and smooth which I have not had lately. I arrived at Pierce Pond Lean-to at 3:30pm. I made good time today thanks to the better trails and lack of large climbs. I met Just Charlie there, Qtip, Shaggy, Squeeknee, Bearsong, Nome, Gametime and a Ridge Runner. There is a camp 0.3 mile away where we can go and sign up for a 12 pancake breakfast which I did. Almost everyone is going as well. Pierce Pond is right in front of the shelter and of course I jumped in. It was very refreshing and cool but not too cold. I took advantage and cleaned my clothes too. It was a very good day and better afternoon. I should get plenty of sleep tonight then I have a pancake breakfast to look forward to at 7am.","Little Bigelow Lean-to

El Tejano,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547201,"I slept very well again. It was beautiful waking up with the morning lake view. I packed up and headed to Harrison's Camp for breakfast where my 12 blueberry, Apple and raspberry pancakes, eggs and sausage and coffee awaited me. I was ready to hike after that!
In 3.5 miles we arrived at Kennebec River where the only way across is to take the ferry which runs from 9am to 2pm. The ferry is a canoe that fits 1 or 2 hikers. I am looking forward to that experience. The hike to the river was very nice. It was along a creek with many little waterfalls which eventually dumped into the river. Yesterday I started to get some pain above my heel on my right foot so I put a band aid on it and put duct tape over it to give it some cushion. I had to stop on the trail and redo it. The duct tape pulled the band aid off and it was really hurting. I fixed it and continued on. When I arrived at the river Gametime was the only one waiting for the ferry. I had to sign a release before I could get into the canoe. I sat in the middle, Gametime in the front rowing and the ferryman in the back rowing. I felt like a VIP since I wasn't rowing. I decided to count out the strokes!!! 
We had a short walk to Caratunk then to Pauls B&B and hiker hostel. Most of the hikers were hanging out in the yard. I just needed a little resupply and they had what I needed there. This Hostel is known for their burger and milkshakes! I charged my phone and ordered a burger and chocolate shake. I wasn't let down. It was fantastic! So many places I stop at make me want to stay longer but I must go. When I set out I planned to go to the first shelter and see how I felt and maybe go further. Well, I arrived at the shelter just before 3pm, it was early and I felt pretty good so I got some water and began hiking the 9 miles to the next shelter. I actually doubted that I would go that far since I had a mountain to climb. 
The terrain was slow and I went through all different kinds of trails, rocky, roots, steep, muddy and nice with pine needles as cushion. Thoughts of the Hobbit came to me, this is the type of trail they would walk through on their adventures! I will find out when I go to New Zealand next year!  I came up on Gnome at the top of Pleasant Pond Mtn. He had hurt his calf and was resting. I gave him some water and continued on. It was steep on the way down which made my hike very slow but then the trail got a little better. I had to find water since I had shared some of mine. When I did, I thought of camping there but there were no adequate spots to pitch a tent so I kept going. I decided at that point that I would try for the shelter. I was 2.4 miles away from the shelter when it started raining. I stopped to put my rain cover on my pack and put my headlamp on as it was dark. This is the first time I went into camp with a headlamp on. I usually get there way before dark. The trail was good so I had a good pace. 
I arrived finally and my blister was really hurting and I was tired. Qtip was there along with two section hikers who were drinking wine and getting a little loud. I could tell there were at least two tents in the area. I set up and walked up to the creek and got water. Dinner was summer sausage burritos, yum yum. I finally laid down and the two guys were really loud. Qtip had been trying to sleep but couldn't. When they finally laid down they started snoring really soon and really loud! Why is it that the snorers are first to sleep???","Pierce Pond Lean-to

We decided to hike together and make it a short day's hike to a shelter 13 miles away. We had one Mtn to climb. We got started a little late at 8:40am. Moxie Bald Mtn was not a bad climb but, it just took a while. We had nice views then we had a steep slow descent. The trail then became much easier then we came to Piscataquos River which a few southbounders had told us we would have to ford. We were actually able to walk on rocks with the help of our poles for stabilization and made it across. There was a hiker sitting there with all his stuff in the sun drying cause he had fallen in. I am glad I didn't fall! For the next 3 miles the trail followed the river. It is always nice to walk hearing the sound of water. We arrived at Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to at 5 pm and there was only one person there. Funny that for the past few days there have not been many hikers on the trail. It was early enough where we got to visit and have a lot of laughs. Elle, a section southbounder, and I slept in the shelter while Diesel and Coldsnap tented right next to us. I ate most of the rest of my food and was still hungry...hiker hunger they call it! I was asleep by 8pm. It was a good day.","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to

I got an early start, 7:40am, and hiked along the Piscataquis River. I hiked next to this very pretty river/trail with Diesel, Coldsnap and Elle the whole way. We went 9 miles and we made good time. There was one nice view before we arrived at Monson.
I had a reservation at Shaws Hostel and their shuttle was dropping off some hikers as we got in so I got a quick ride to town. The driver picked up the rest of my group for free! This is yet another example of the acts of kindness that we receive on the trail daily. My blisters on both of my feet hurt all day so I got out of my boots right away! We wanted to eat first so he dropped us off at the BBQ place and took our packs to the hostel. 
The BBQ and the beer was great. After our meal, we walked over to the ATC welcome center to reserve our spot to summit Katahdin. It was really a cool feeling being in Monson, the last town before the end. I called Yvonne to see when she was coming to meet me at the end and determined that my summit date is the 4th. That gives me 7 days to go through the 100 mile wilderness which is fine with me. It gives me more time to enjoy the last days of the trail. It's funny how I just wanted to finish at any cost not too long ago and now, I don't mind taking my time and enjoying the outdoors more. I have enjoyed Maine. It is just beautiful. I hope to come back sometime and visit some of the towns and lakes. Diesel and Coldsnap actually have a cabin in Greenville about 20 minutes away. They got the Shaws shuttle to take them there and I rode along to check out their place. It was on a canal that connected to Moodehead Lake...very nice! I would definitely love to come back and visit them there. 
When I got back I settled in at the hostel, did laundry and showered. For dinner I sat outside by a lake and saw some of my fellow hikers, Bearsong and Squeeknee, coming in from the lake in a paddle boat. They joined me on the deck for a drink. It was a very nice setting with good company. Back at the hostel I caught up on my blog and uploaded my pictures. I need some rest now.

I went to sleep late and did not sleep well but the show must go on. It was time to get my gear packed and get moving. Since I will take 7 days to do the next 110 miles I have arranged a food drop 53 miles in for Wednesday. Yes, my food will literally be dropped off at a designated spot in the woods.   I hope I can find it!The breakfast was really good, coffee, 3 eggs, bacon, country potatoes, orange juice and blueberry pancakes! I'm ready for the day. I dressed my blisters on my feet and had to pop one then Poet dropped me off at the trailhead at 9:15am. I left a little later than I wanted too as it took me a little longer than I anticipated to get everything done. The important thing is that I got everything done. The hike was definitely in the wilderness. The sky was overcast with 20% Rain forecast for the entire day so it was gloomy in the woods. There wasn't a flat trail to be found. Everything was up and down. It wasn't too difficult but it had me moving slowly. The trail was the typical Maine trail with lots of roots, rocks, ponds and streams to cross. I have not needed to take my shoes off yet to get across any streams. If it wasn't for my poles, I just may have fallen in! I had a view on one of the hill tops and came across a beautiful waterfall where I stopped for lunch. The shelter's water source is dry so I filled up after crossing the last stream. I reached the shelter at 6:15pm and quickly got washed up and situated. I was even able to call my wife! Wow! My first day in the wilderness! I can see that it will be slow hiking for 3 days but, after then I should be able to make better time. 7 days to go on the trail! I am having lots of thoughts running through my mind as to what I want to do when I go home. There are so many things but first, I would love to have a couple of days of nothing!

This is the first time a mouse has gotten to my food. I left a mounds bar in the waist belt pocket of my backpack and a mouse ate a hole through the fabric to get it! Now I have a hole there which I will need to sew when I get home. I never even saw or heard the mouse and I really do love my mounds! I was not in any hurry so I took my time and started my hike at 7:45am. The going was slow again. I was on the same terrain but this time it was wet so I had to be extra careful when stepping on rocks and roots. I climbed a few peaks, Barren Mtn, Fourth Mtn, Mt Three and a Half (Weird name), Third Mtn, Columbus Mtn and Chairback Mtn. There were some nice views from a couple of them too. The hike, like yesterday, was mostly in the woods so there wasn't much to see other than a lot of trees. Somehow, that is still very pretty to me. There were not as many streams so I had to really watch my water supply. Whenever there was water, I would resupply just in case. The forest was very quiet. Squirrels and chipmunks were the only wildlife I saw. I crossed paths with a few southbounders but that was it as far as seeing other hikers goes.I was thinking a lot of all the hikers I have spent time with, some are finished, some are just ahead and will finish before me this week and others are behind. I've gotten contact information for a few hikers and hopefully we will stay in touch. Aurora and Conundrum who I have spent the most time with got ahead of me a little over a week ago and will be climbing Katahdin on Thursday. I miss meeting up with them and many others. I arrived at the tent area at 5:30 pm and there was only one other person there. Another hiker came just before dark. I walked to the river that I have to cross tomorrow and heard my name called from the other side. It was Cheetah who I have not seen in two weeks. Maybe I can catch her and Blue tomorrow. It would be nice to have someone familiar around. It was mostly overcast and windy today and it seemed to clear up once I got to camp. Hopefully it is clear tomorrow and the sun will dry up the moisture on the trail. It's a nice evening in my tent. I can hear the river. I should sleep very well.","Long Pond Stream Lean-to

Without them I would not have made it but I did. That was fun. 
The next mile was easy hiking then the ups and downs started again! I climbed Gulf Hagas Mtn, West Peak, Hay Mtn and White Cap Mtn which had some incredible 360 degree views...just beautiful. I also got my first view of Mt Katahdin. It is great to see my goal! It definitely stood out from all the surrounding mountains. I'll be there Sunday and can't wait!!

I left the shelter by 7:30am which gave me enough time to travel 11.5 miles by 2 pm to meet someone for my food resupply at Jo Mary Rd. I hoped the trail was less rocky. I had one climb to Little Boardman Mtn and had a good view...it was not very high though. The rest of the trail was a mix of easy and hard. It was pretty flat but because of the rains everything was wet and slippery. I took a break at Cooper Falls Lean-to. It was very pretty there with a little river with falls right in front. I reached Jo Mary Rd at 1pm, an hour ahead of schedule, and I sat next to the gravel road by the little River and had lunch. I was going to end up at Antler campground but, if I can make good time, maybe the next lean to 7 miles away will be where I end up. I wouldn't mind being in a shelter in case it rains again! Last night we talked about what would feel better...actually climbing Katahdin and taking a picture at the top or when you come back down and you know that you are through hiking. Hmmmm, never thought about that. That is something to think about. I got my food drop at 2:20pm and got on my way. I decided to go for the shelter.

I soaked my hurting feet in the stream that had water was so cold that it numbed my feet. My left foot is feeling better but my right one is really bad.

The hike was a little tough on the feet because of all the rocks and roots but, it was a very relaxing and beautiful trail. There was water in sight on 90% of the trail today. I hiked by rivers along creeks, around lakes and ponds. I climbed Nesuntabunt Mtn where there was a view of a lake and I had a 16 mile line of site to Mt Katahdin which was just breathtaking. Katahdin looked awesome. I just can't wait to climb it! I decided to camp at Rainbow Stream Lean-to since my feet were hurting and I couldn't go any further. About a mile before arriving at camp I started walking along Rainbow Stream. It was cascading and moving fast through natural chutes caused by the rock formations. I was walking against the flow which made it look very pretty the whole way. Parts of the woods today reminded me of a couple of rain forests that I have day hiked in. It was dark due to the thick canopy of the trees and it was green and damp. I never imagined Maine being so green. When I arrived a section hiker had a campfire going in front of the shelter. Jethro was there then Blue and Cheetah came in. Two more section hikers and a flip-flopper came in also. That was the most hikers I have seen at a campsite in a while. This was another nice setting for a shelter with the creek right in front. It is nice to have water source so close. We all set up our tents and congregated in front of the fire and shelter.

Before Maine, I had only heard that sound on TV. I saw the Loon on the pond and was able to get a photo. They look like a duck but they are a bit bigger. They can dive underwater for a long time and are very strong. When they pick a mate it is for life. I got away from the water and got into the deep woods. It was like a rain forest. I came up on an area called the ledges that had limited views. I realized that tonight was going to be the last time I set up my tent, then I started thinking about what else would be the last. After today I may not have to filter water again. No more resupply and no more cold breakfast, lunch and dinners! Wow, what a realization. At first my thought was great, but then maybe I will miss it..I don't know. I reached Abol Bridge campground at 2:30 pm and from the bridge I had a clear view of Katahdin. It looks big! I could see the greenery on the lower parts that I couldn't see before as I was too far. Jethro and I set our tents up and went to the restaurant, Blastoise (war turtle) was already tenting and came to meet us after a while. Cheetah, Blue and Red joined us later. We had dinner and a couple of beers. Afterwards Blastoise, Jethro and I sat by our tents talking, snacking and having a couple of beers. It was a nice setting by the river.

All the things that have led me to where I am now. I have a great life. I have family and friends that I miss and am ready to get back to. This will be the last time I will wake up in my tent on the Appalachian trail and pack up. My thoughts were that I did not take my children camping when they were young. As a parent I always look back and think that I could have done things differently or made a different decision in raising my children. Right now I wish I would have taken them camping and done a little more for them to experience the outdoors. That would have been good for me too. It's never too late they say. I have a young grandson who I will definitely take camping. I can't wait. I really miss him. At 6am it was time to start packing up to make it to the all you can eat breakfast at the restaurant. That was a great start to another wonderful day! The forecast was for a cool morning with clear skies and a sunny day. That sounded perfect! Jethro, Blastoise and I sat together for breakfast and it was packed. There were lots of people there to do whitewater rafting. All the rafters arrived together then all left at the same time because they needed to get on the bus to be transported to the start of their rafting. We laughed when Blastoise said, they don't understand the concept of all you can eat! We planned on being there the full 2 hours that we were allowed! Yes, we are hiker trash! Blue and Cheetah arrived to join us and the next two hours were great!We began hiking a little after 9am. Blastoise, Jethro and I kept leapfrogging each other throughout the day and we hiked together for a bit. The trail went along the Penobscot River which made for beautiful views, then it went along Abol Stream, Abol Pond, Katahdin Stream, lower and upper forks of Nesowadnehunk Stream and Grassy Pond. The trail was mostly easy to hike on so I was able to make good time. There were many side trails to sites and other trails intersecting the AT. I saw many of the rafters at a cool waterfall. People would jump into the water and it would take them down a rock like a natural slide and into the river. It looked like fun. I took a couple of side trails to see Little Niagara Falls, Big Niagara Falls and Toll Damn. The falls were very pretty. There is so much beauty around me. I am ready to go home but not ready to leave the wilderness. I would love to come back and hike slower with no schedule to enjoy the sites a little longer. As I got closer to Katahdin Springs campground I saw more day hikers. I talked to a couple who had their 11 yr old daughter with them who I later saw at dinner. I Reached the campground and went to the ranger station which was closed. Jethro was going to camp there while Blastoise and I were heading to town to stay in the hostel. We hitched a ride to town with two ladies from the Penobscot Indian tribe. Labor Day weekend is when the Wabanaki Nation makes their yearly pilgrimage. The Penobscots are part of the Wabanaki nation along with 4 other tribes. They travel 100 miles by running, biking, or canoeing and they start from an island just north of Bangor, ME and end at Katahdin Springs. They are tracing the steps of their ancestors. They do not summit Katahdin Mtn becaise they believe it is sacred and they are not worthy of climbing it. It was a very interesting story. I asked a lot of questions and they happily answered. We got dropped off in Millinocket and Blastoise and I walked to the hostel, dropped our stuff off, and went to get lunch. I had a lobster roll which was very good. After dinner, I showered and washed my clothes. I am sure that Yvonne will appreciate this as it has been 7 days since I had a shower and clean clothes! I was tired but I felt good. Yvonne arrived to many hugs and kisses from me. It is so good to have her here. We went out to eat dinner but the service was slow. Fortunately the food was good.

The drive is normally 45 minutes but there was a line to get into the park so it took us a while. If you don't have a parking pass you don't get in. With it being a holiday weekend, Labor Day, the line was longer than normal.   It took a little over an hour for the total trip. Once we arrived, I signed in with the ranger and got ready to hike. When I started on my adventure on Springer Mtn in Georgia, my number was around 600...the 600th hiker starting to thru hike, at Harper's Ferry I was number 389, at Katahdin I was 559. They say 80% of thru hikers who start drop out. I feel really good about being in that small percentage of hikers who finish. I did not sleep well last night but I'm feeling good about summiting. Yvonne joined me for the first 1.1 miles to a waterfall and then she sent me off! The first mile was not too bad. It was a nice trail and the terrain coursed steadily uphill to the waterfall. We were above the waterfall and we could hear it very well. Yvonne found a spot to sit down and I continued on. It got steeper and rockier as I hiked. I thought I would have more feelings as I am coming to the end of the hike. I felt like this is a normal day hike and I finished the AT when I came out on Abol Bridge 2 days ago. It is kind of weird to feel that way. I decided to play a little game and count how many hikers I passed going to the summit and how many passed me. I saw quite a few hikers start at the campground before me this morning. I came up on Jethro and his family who drove up to hike the last day with him. It was his mom, dad, sister and brother in-law, that was pretty adventurous for them to do that. As I continued on and got above the treeline, the big rocks became more prevalent. I had my poles in my backpack just in case I needed them but, I knew that using my hands would be the best way to go! It was a beautiful day but more importantly it was sunny and dry. That is a very important factor when you are scrambling on the rocks. Now this was fun. The rocks were marked well with white blazes but sometimes making your own way works out better. I started passing many hikers as they were taking breaks. The higher I climbed the faster I seemed to go. When I would stop to take in what was around me I have to say that the views were incredible, just beautiful. I was pretty high up which gave me a great vantage point for almost the rest of the way up. I could see some hikers in the distance above and ahead of me. My short term goal...catch them! I eventually did. Being a through hiker has given me the stamina to continue hiking even on steep hills without breaks especially with a light backpack.   Finally I saw the top!! There seemed to be many people up there. I had forgotten that there are other trails that take you to the summit, easier trails, which most day hikers take. I definitely don't blame them. As I approached the summit I still was not feeling the jubilation of the end, not that I didn't want it to end because I did but it just seemed like another day. When I was almost there I noted that I passed 38 hikers, none of them through hikers, and nobody passed me! Now that made me feel good. When I reached the top there were probably 50 people scattered about and I was the only through hiker. There was a group of college kids taking a picture with the Katahdin sign, about 15 of them, I waited for them to finish so I could take a picture. As I was waiting someone asked what trail I hiked, then asked how many days, miles, and other questions which I answered. They were amazed at what I had done. He shouted out for everyone to hear that I had just finished hiking the whole AT and the whole mountain erupted with clapping and cheering. They made way for me to take pictures and suddenly I felt like a Rock Star! I sat down to eat lunch and people would come up and congratulate me and ask questions. It was a pretty cool feeling. I just finished hiking 2190 miles! That is pretty awesome if I may say so myself!I stayed on top for about 45 minutes taking in the beauty of the surrounding views and talking to people. My AT through hike has come to an end but not my hiking. I still have to go back down! It was time to leave the summit. I was happy and felt like I was walking home which I have been wanting to do for quite a while. I started passing more day hikers and through hikers. It was great that I new them all and had hiked with them at one time or another. They congratulated me and I them. I was feeling great! The hike down was faster than I thought. I had great views almost all of the way. The last mile was pretty flat and I felt light on my feet and couldn't wait to see Yvonne. It took me 2:50 hrs to go up and 3:10 hrs to come down. As I made it to the campground I saw Yvonne sitting at the first picnic table. Another table had a family sitting around it and they started clapping for me. A big hug from Yvonne made my day. I'm home...not quite but it sure felt like it. We walked over to the ranger station and waited for a couple of hours for the shuttle back to town and by then more through hikers had made it down the mountain. They rode with us back to town. It is good to have nice company because it makes the drive shorter than it actually is.Stay tuned...More to come.","Katahdin Springs Campground
