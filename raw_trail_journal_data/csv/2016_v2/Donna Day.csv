Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547335,"Tuesday evening and leaving 6 am Friday to head to our stating point in VA. I am so excited and also have the familiar angst of checking details and asking myself am I ready. The answer to that question is I will be as ready as I can by Friday. What happens on the trail to mind, body and spirit is yet to be told. Preparations have included a lot of dehydrating of food. Second time doing this for an extended hike and I was a little more creative. I used some soup/noodle mixes already sold in the stores dehydrated and added protein and more veggies. I also am using Ramen Noodles as my ""spaghetti"" noodle on the trail. It s the ease and cost that made me decide to try it. Still the most challenging prep for food is deciding on lunches. When not hiking ,fresh veggies and fruits are my normal lunch. I shy away from carbs. On the trail Ive got to consume carbs and proteins and consider weight and packability. So to expand my standard peanut butter and carb lunch Im adding tuna fish and crackers and cheese and crackers. I can't stomach the summer sausages or pepperonis. I wish I could.",,Appalachian Trail,"Aug 30, Tue",0
Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547352,"How do I determine what first aide supplies I bring.? And what I leave behind? If I go by my experience on the Long Trail (and I will) moleskin, bandaids and antibiotic ointment are the body of what I need. There is also the pain and anti inflammation meds I used quick a bit. Arnica , a gel that treats arthritic and inflamed joints was also used a lot.  I never used the space blanket yet am considering keeping it in the pack. Gauze roll and tape to make a splintis being considered. Small pair of scissors and a device to suck snake venom out are being considered( only $5). A couple of sterile gauze pads for stopping blood flow., and a foldable first aid how to piece of paper.",,Appalachian Trail,"Aug 31, Wed",0
Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547569,"Today was a 10 mile hike on the most perfect weather day of the month?   Crisp clear air, puffy high clouds and blue sky. The temp was a perfect mid 60s. Started on Jerusalem Trail walked the ridge to Mt Abraham and down to Battle Shelter.   Then to Battle Trail to the parking lot.   Awesome day. Tomorrow leaving at 6 am to head for VA.",,Deanna and Donna Soaking in Nature,"Sep 01, Thu",10
Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547644,Made it to Ironmasters Mansion. A hostel in the pine Grove Furnace State Park. It was a slave run iron ore business and the owners lived in this mansion. We got pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw for $5 and breakfast is included in the overbite fee of $25.This house was part of the Underground Railroad in its later years. We were shown the trap door in a closet that drops down to a 10x6 room under the house. We were told that there used to be two tunnels leading out of the space but they have been blocked off.,"

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547798,"9.2 tough miles, having thoughts of 'Why do I like this' and 'This is crazy, This is not fun.
But at the end of the day after seeing delicate blue wild flowers and a westerly view of Va, probably into West Virginia and the people along the way it all seems worthwhile. I'll get up again tomorrow and do it again.","

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548565,"Back again with cell service and a working phone!! I have been battling many trail challenges this week, and feel like I am finally climbing over the last one and hopefully back hiking on Monday
The Hazy Hot Humid conditions have taken there toll on my body and state of mind. But this is an endurance hike so not unexpected . Because VA has not had rain in 3 weeks I've had to carry up to 6lbs in just water to get me through to the next spring or stream. Frequent cool down of body temps have been necessary and so it's taking longer to complete each day. The good news is weather change coming Thursday and looks like rain and cooler more seasonal temps. 
The other Boulder (stumbling block or stepping stone yet to be seen) is the ridiculous amount of run in with bees . The day before I left VT Erin and I were setting up fencing and I stepped on in ground yellow jacket nest - six stings. First day on the trail ,walking through high weeds a hornet dropped into my boot. Dancing with 30 lbs on my back while trying to get off a hiking boot might have been comical for onlookers but not me at the time- two more stings. Then on a beautiful ascent to a groomed ridge walk I walked through a pile of dirt on the trail and discover more hornets- six stings.
By the time I got off trail and to a hotel I started developing Arapaho and by morning was in urgent care getting prednisone shots. But the good news is I am finally improving and if this last round of shots and pills work I could be hiking with a backup dose of prednisone and an epi pen.
I've rented a car and am taking care of myself , supporting Carlene's hike(yes she's back out there) and hoping to join her soon.!!","Pearisburg VA

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548758,2:30 in the afternoon and waiting at Harveys Knob. There is a large number of bird watchers here too. This is a major migration route for Hawks and other raptors. It's been educational talking with them. One couple has three husked that are lovable and sweet.

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548838,"It was a misty moisture morning on the Blueridge Parkway. I met Carlene at 7 a.m. And took all the extra weight she could part with. She has another 13 mile day. I'll meet her 9 miles later and return her stuff to her. 
Meanwhile I make progress. I can know where my hiking boots with little discomfort from the poison ivy. (Did I mention ivy? Got it on top of the bee stings). So today I'm confirming my shuttle ride to return the rental and get me back on the trail. Ill spend some time at the lovely Buchanan Public Library and wonder around taking pics.","Peaks of Otter

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548976,"Back to hiking, finally. Sometimes it's hard to lay low . Another sunny beautiful day. I'll drop off the rental and Homer, a shuttle driver will give me a ride to Glasgow . We are following our original itinerary but one day behind.","

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548982,"Killing time , waiting for my shuttle driver. I am looking forward to a shower and doing laundry. Camping is rustic but not totally devoid of hygiene. I do brush my teeth twice a day and if there is enough water I at least wash today's from off my body. I don't use soap but revert to the dry rub method. I use a small loofah and scrub skin with a little water. It works!! The lack shampooing is something to get used to. And the hardest part is wearing smelly , sweat soaked clothes over and over. Limiting the amount of clothes I carry means everything gets dirty. My pack has 1 pair of rain pants 1 rain jacket, one long sleeve light fleece, two shirts, one pair shorts, one skirt, and one bra/ underwear .0h and three pair of socks. I also carry night clothes that I never hike in so they are dry and warm if I need that. They too do smell after awhile. Laundry and showers, luxuries I'm starting to dream about.0","

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549078,"Not all plans work as expected and problem solving and flexibility have helped us along the way, also a lot of prayers!!We both got shuttles to Glasgow, Carlene from her last hike and me from the car rental in Roanake and met at the town pavilion Hikers Hostel. It was simple accommodations . We had dry shelter from the coming rain, a place to charge phones, an outdoor shower and a laundromat within walking distance. Hikers are easy to please. But as evening fell and so did the rain, a man joined us at the shelter. He said he was a hiker but his story was questionable. Alcohol breath and constant chatter gave us the reason for the concerned look between us. We told him we had to sleep and rest and he promised to be quiet. He proceeded to put on his headlamp and paced and puttered and fussed with things ALL night long. It became apparent he was homeless and this was a respite from Ted rain . Needless to say neither Carlene or I slept much at all. When the sun rose we made plans to vacate and moved to a Super8 Motel two towns away. All was made extremely easy by our shuttle driver and dear dear man named Aubrey Taylor","Glasgow

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549079,"Dear, dear Aubrey, he came to retrieve us in Glasgow with in 15 minutes of telling of our plight with ""Nubs"" the homeless guy. He drove us through Buenos Vista pat the hotel we were considering and said he had a better place for us. He has been looking after hikers for over 50 years and he felt like our guardian that day. He grew up in the Appalchian Mtns in a cabin with no running water , no electricity. He bathed in the creek in the summers and heated water on a wood stove in the winter. When he began assuring hikers 50 years ago he was on horseback and he'd check the journal at the shelters to see what hikers needed. He has so many great stories from leaving a whiskey bottle every year for one hiker to search and rescue of a blind hiked. He knows these mountains like the back of his hand . We are blessed to have connected with him. His sefvice is all word of mouth and I would highly recommend this gentle soul to other hikers!!","Reconnect with Carlene

Donna Day,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549977,"NOBO again with our full back. Walked through a Nattural Forest , which is a tract of forest left to grow and develop without human intervention or harvesting. Scientists are studying natural tree growth. Seems like something that should have been done long ago. The trees are beautifully large, undergrowth is sparse since the tree canopy is dense. There were so many varieties of nuts and the are all dropping. It sounds like we are being bombed by the squirrels!Saw a box turtle in the middle of the trail","Appalachian Trail

Wonderful food and rest and company.Marcia helped us is the rattlesnake and butterflies.Oh yes the snake was yesterday. I was walking down the trail when I heard that very distinctive rattle which is loud and intense. It stopped me in my tracks and I did a complete reverse. The snake was slithering up the path so it tail is what was closest to me. I was lucky. After taking a few pics if got tired of us and coiled near the path.
