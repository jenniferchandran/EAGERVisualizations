Bald Eagle and I were the first to arrive. Hikers straggled in later, two with dogs. Jingles, who has a boxer named Ziva, was the first. She wanted to stay in the shelter but thought we would disapprove because of her dog Ziva. We assured her it was OK so she put her mattress pad and Ziva's next to mine. So I was resting with a boxer bulldog less than arm's length. I could not sleep for smelling something much like a skunk scent. I also heard a psssst like an occasional spray. Laying in the dark and fearing the worse, a skunk, I grabbed my light. It immediately illuminated a boxer butt within 2 inches of my nose. So you know what the occasional psssst was. I learned today that is a common trait with boxer's. I immediately turned my mattress pad and sleeping bag 180 degrees so that my head was sticking out of the shelter opening in fresh air.

Up a steep incline of stair steps and into ice and snow. The ascent was long and tricky. I climbed for a few tricky hours then entering a narrow ribbon of trail not much wider than car tires. The mountain on each side dropped away nearly sheer for at least a thousand feet. The wind mimicked life as it ascended from the valley floor. Like a living organism it rushed up the mountain seemingly to hit me dead center and blow me into the precipice. Sounding like a low flying jumbo jet, with a roar as it approached, then directly on me making its presence known, then as quick, descending the mountain with the roar fading, then gone. After slipping and sliding, maintaining intense focus on every step for 8 hours, I arrived at the first shelter wanting to warm up and rest for the night. There was no room.

Max Patch Bald is a 5 acre grass meadow at the summit of a mountain deep in the back country of the Cherokee National Forest.

I am adapting to this rigorous adventure by accepting each challenge as it appears. The trail seems to be more uphill than not. Hikers have to temper their spirit for this or the sharp sickle of attrition will cut them at their knees. Bald Eagle and I realize this because we are seeing fewer hikers as we plod northeast.

The summit is small with cliffs on one side and a less than shear drop on the other. Still spooky. The view is incredible.

The high overcast kept it dark but enjoyable nonetheless. We continue to climb as the sun broke through occasionally bringing the spring colors to life. I saw a particularly interesting conifer with cones the size of a thimble. The tree itself is so perfect that it looks manufactured.

I think the person who said that should get a new dictionary. The AT is never easy. We hiked through forest that is carbon copy of past forest. Fatiguing uphills over vast fields of rock. After seven hours, forty minutes, and 15.4 miles we arrived at Laurel Creek on USFS road 615. The foot bridge is nice and the area around the bridge offers convenient access to the stream. I stuck bare feet in the stream for 5 seconds. The water ice cold. My feet rejuvenated. Cold water splashed on my hair and face and I am good to go. We will hike a little over 18 miles tomorrow.

This changes in the afternoon as bruised clouds gather and spit rain briefly. We luck out. This hike is for a friend in Nashville who is battling a health challenge. I pray for Karen to heal quickly and exit the hospital to return to her normal life. I will hope and pray for Karen this hike and the days and months ahead.

Over night rain had the trail looking more like a pig sty than a trail. We were careful with foot placement and managed to stay vertical all day. The foot bridges were very slippery. The trail skirted streams 80% of the distance today. They are high, fast and very loud due to the recent rain. We ate our lunch at a shelter that has a dark history. 2 hikers were befriended by a third who murdered them as they slept in 1981 at the shelter. There was a rare mauling in the Smokey's a couple of days ago. A bear bit a hiker through his tent. The hiker was able to get out and luckily had a cell signal and called a park ranger. The bear shredded the tent. The only plausible explanation is the hiker had food in his tent. Bears are just coming out of hibernation and are ravenous. That is why I carry a paracord to throw over a limb and suspend my food 10 - 12' above the ground. This limb is a good distance from the tent. No bear sighting yet. Maybe tomorrow.

We ascended into the clouds on a stony path that was often muddy. The temp was 52 degrees and grew colder as we gained altitude. The clouds were not spitting rain but the trees were with every gust. We walked the 3500' ridgeline that brought us upon very dangerous slabs of wet stone. Slip and you go down the sliding board of a slab and over the edge into free fall. There is a precipice on top of the slabs that were sure to claim you should you venture to far that way. It was a precarious balancing act that required strict focus. I do not like heights and this gave me the heebie jeebies. This went on for at least 1000' of trail. We passed the eastern continental divide which was interesting. We also passed the oldest oak tree on the trail. 3 centuries old. What will tomorrow bring? I will find out. Blue Skies.,"VA 42

This traverse is scary enough in dry conditions and absolutely menacing in the wet conditions today. Narrow ledges with precipices waiting to claim you with one misstep.

The trail skirted the very edge of the cliffs. We stopped for a moment to speak to the young lady in the picture. She was sitting at the very edge of the precipice. She seemed to be simply enjoying the view and the quiet. She was very nice even though I interrupted her meditation to comment on her lack of fear. Her being at that edge gave me the heebie jeebies. The clouds had dissipated and the view of the valley was breathtaking. Limping along with a sore toe was well worth it.

A broken cloud deck, temperature in the high 50's, a promise of sunshine, and birds singing. A great beginning to a walk. The relatively dry terrain was a welcome sight as we began a short climb. We straddled the ridgeline and stayed there for hours today. Pine needles carpeted the trail for a few miles then turning to bare earth, then rocks. At times the shoulders of the trail gave way to precipices with very, very, long drops. A couple of overlooks yielded views of distant mountains that awed. The mountains made me wonder how many moonshiners were nestled in their bosom at that very moment. ""White Lightning "" is readily available in these mountain communities. The AT is always difficult but occasionally we hike sections that are less difficult. Today was such a trail. Forgiving until the last few miles and then gnarly. Seems to always happen that way.

McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs, breathtaking. Dragons Tooth, aptly named for I think dragons are gnarly. There has been miles and miles of less than exciting terrain but the views have made up for it. The forest is lush and rightfully so. It has rained everyday for three weeks! The flora is encapsulating the trail with leaves, mountain laurel, and rhododendrons in many sections. It is fun to wade through this. Bald Eagle and I passed the one third mark today. We were fired up to have covered over 730 miles. Many conquered obstacles lay in our wake, many, many more lay before us. I have derived personal growth from this and expect much more. Deprivation has spawned a renewal of spirit and appreciation.

Like much of Virginia trail there was little difference. Rocky and hard on the feet. I was very glad when I reached my destination. I have been on the trail 2 months and 10 days. I have my trail legs now. I have written a few lines about that. ""When you get your trail legs."" My good friend and fellow aviator uttered this phrase the first time it hit my ears. ""Sky King"" thru-hiked in 2009. I have been on this adventure for over 2 months and have heard that phrase many times. I have heard of frog legs, chicken legs, turkey legs, crab legs, skinny legs, fat legs, hairy legs, short legs, long legs, and peg legs but never trail legs. And how long does it take to acquire a shiny, new set of trail legs? I have heard 1, 1 1/2, 2 months. How do you know when your trail legs have arrived? I think one has his or her trail legs when the following occurs:* Steep uphills are of no concern. One foot in front of the other until gravity is no longer a battle* When steep descents no longer burn your toes and balls of your feet since you have learned to plant your heel and roll your foot* You understand that late in the day fatigue breeds complacency and focus on each step must be practiced. (A face plant resulting in a couple of bruised ribs and very sore shoulder taught me that)* Multitasking while negotiating extremely narrow trail is a big no-no! Very steep mountain sides await the careless hiker who steps on soft trail shoulder while concentrating on the beef jerky in a difficult backpack or obscures vision with a bandana while tending the ever present runny nose. * Having your tent and related components readily available when camping in the face of a storm. Pitching said tent efficiently and swiftly in inclement weather. * Loading your backpack so that unloading is easier.I am sure this is an abbreviated list and I will learn more as I hike. When I began this great adventure I had no idea there is so much to learn about a walk in the woods. A couple of notes about the list of legs. * My Sister has a Yorkshire Terrier. She has a leash for this dog that has the following written in bold letters down the leash, ""ONE OF US HAS HAIRY LEGS!"" I had to share that. My Sister has since bought a razor. * I had dinner one night in a restaurant noted for delicious frog legs. When the waitress greeted us to take our order I asked if she had frog legs. She responded with an enthusiastic ""Yes I do."" So I said, ""Well hop back there and get me a beer!"" Y'all stay safe out there. Blue Skies","Jennings Creek

Hoody,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535705,"I hiked this section with my friends Russell and Ford. 2 great guys who I thoroughly enjoy walking with. We climbed some very steep terrain. Ford said that it was so steep he nearly touched his nose as he climbed. I lost my favorite bandana on the trail the day before. A few miles into the hike today Ford pointed to a cooler size rock on the side of the trail and, lo and behold, there lay my bandana! Hikers most certainly have a golden thread running through the fabric of their soul. The terrain today was more attractive than previous terrain. It skirted streams and the James River. We eventually arrived at the James River Foot Bridge. This is a foot bridge named after a trail maintainer named Foot. I am leaving the trail today and returning home. After having a nasty corn cut out of my toe last week the problem has surfaced again. I have to correct this before continuing. I am sure that most, if not all, long distance hikers suffer foot pain. I have endured this for over 500 miles. Chronic pain is difficult to ignore and shadows the beauty of the AT experience. 
My friend and fellow hiker, Bald Eagle, has taken a break in the pursuit of his 20 year dream of hiking the AT.
