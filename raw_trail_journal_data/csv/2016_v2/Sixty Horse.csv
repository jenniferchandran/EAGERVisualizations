Sixty Horse,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541953,"Hiking the Appalachian Trail in sections as a thru-hiking flip-flopper is my plan. Don't ask me why I suddenly have the urge to hike the AT in its entirety. I have no bucket-list of things undone, but maybe it was the back operation I had last August that was the impetus for this endeavor. Start date July 31st. A nice hot time of year. Point of departure, Caledonia State Park, Pennsylvania. It's fairly close to mid-point, give or take a few miles which I think will give me a definite psychological advantage. That said, let the preparations begin.There's an unbelievable amount of research to prepare for this kind of thing. Getting physically and mentally prepared is hard enough, but there's a lot more to it than that. Gear, food, books, maps, more gear, decisions about this and that have to be made. Do Post Office mail drops or re-supplying along the way make more sense, or maybe a combination of the two? Do I sleep in hotels, hostels, shelters or totally rough it camping? Decisions, decisions, decisions. At times, it seems overwhelming.Over the past several months, I've ordered gear, read tons, and hiked a great deal. I've done multiple overnights on sections of the Sheltowee Trace, near our farm in Kentucky, with the assistance of my wife, Cindy. She dropped me off and picked me up at pre-arranged rendezvous locations. I've hiked miles and miles carrying my thirty-five pound pack. Has it been enough? Who knows? I feel prepared, but does anyone really know if they're ready before they hit the trail? The mind is willing, but the body is weak. Put that thought out of mind.Enough chit chat. Two and a half weeks to go. Check back in if you want to see how I'm getting on.",,Motivation,"Jul 13, Wed",0
Sixty Horse,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542904,"Doing a little practice hiking this week in preparation for next Sundays start. Loaded pack with thirty-five pounds or so and I'm hiking on our farm. Three miles each day isn't a great deal, but the training is more of a breaking in shoes exercise. Not sure if I'm ready for the excessive heat, but that doesn't matter because there's nothing I can do about it. Feel fairly strong, guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",,Practice,"Jul 20, Wed",0
Sixty Horse,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544569,"July 31stStarting off at Caledonia State Park on day one, I was pumped. It was a nice looking morning and Cindy and I had just spent the night at Clarion Inn Chambersburg. The hotel provided a continental breakfast which included hot food. Needless to say I took advantage of that situation and filled up on eggs, ham, toast, yogurt, juice, and coffee. My wife dropped me at the park entrance just before eight o'clock Sunday morning. We said goodbye and Cindy watched from the car as I trudged away.        The trail started off tough with hundreds of yards of roots to deal with. It was a consistent seven-hundred foot climb spread out over three miles. I hoped for a change to the trail as my feet tangled with roots and my wish was fulfilled. Rocks, the trail immediately took a turn for the worst and transitioned to rock. There were rocks of all sorts and in never-ending supply. There were sedimentary, crystalline, shale, even dike walls which reminded me of southern Colorado. My right foot had been giving me problems for quite some time and it didn't let me down.         The humidity was killer, it felt like the jungle. I was sweating so profusely that I could hardly hold onto my trekking poles. I took a much needed break and got water at Old Forge picnic area. At Antietam Shelter I met a couple of thru-hikers, Hazelnut and Moses Stick. Hazelnut had a great attitude about the whole hiking endeavor. I'd be wise to follow her lead.         The hike was hard but after it was over I was feeling more optimistic. I wasn't hungry, but I was definitely thirsty even though I had drunk plenty of water. I wondered if I was drinking enough.        Just before I reached the shelter, there was a spring that meandered across the trail and I filled my hydration pack and my extra water bottles before preparing dinner. Maybe things were going to smooth out after all.","Caledonia State Park

Sixty Horse,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544843,"August 1stAfter a fitful night at Deer Lick Shelters, I was anxious to move. A thru-hiker whose trail name was Forgetful Jim arrived after I had. He told me that he'd earned his name because he always left stuff behind whenever he trekked off in the morning. He'd be forced to turn back and claim what he'd forgotten. I'm not sure if his name was Forgetful Jim or Bob. Obviously, he's not the only one with recollection issues.         I hadn't been able to get my wood stove to light and went to bed without eating. The same thing happened the following morning. All the wood in the area was thoroughly soaked. I enjoyed a breakfast of trail mix even though I'm toting ten pounds of vacuum sealed dehydrated dinners I've yet to taste. I'll get those kinks ironed out too.        I was heading south by six. I didn't have a destination today, but wanted to get some miles under my belt. The trail started off easy enough, but transitioned to rock after only a mile or so. By now, my weak right foot was behaving like it wasn't part of my leg.         I'd heard that PA was stinking with deer, but I'd yet to see any. I reached the PA-MD border by nine and I still hadn't seen one. Pen Mar's park is nice and I was glad it had benches, bath rooms, and water. The sun was bright so I took off my shoes and socks to let them air out. Other than my ankle, my feet were in good shape. I met a couple of hikers from Maryland that were planning to thru-hike the state.         Leaving Pen Mar Park, I was excited that the trail followed an old trolley line, I was stoked actually. I marched along with my head down, but started to get nervous as the trail continued in that easy rock-free state. I glanced around looking for the white blazes that denoted the AT, but saw none. I had to backtrack. I found the turn I'd missed and unfortunately it went in the opposite direction up a rocky incline. I took it, begrudgingly.        My detour had cost me, now I'm low on water as I stare up at a three-hundred foot climb in front of me and groan. Halfway up the boulder strewn trail my hydration pack is dry. The suns intense and I have no water. I'm two miles from Raven Rock Shelter. Two days on the trail and I've screwed up royally. Fortunately, I ran into a family at the High Rock Loop Trail and asked for help. They went out of their way to get water for me. I thanked my trail angels repeatedly and then headed for the shelter.        There were five others at Raven Rock that evening. My wet wood issues continued, so I had a double dose of pudding. It was wonderful and it's the only thing in my pack besides trail mix that doesn't require heating. Two men in the group were originally from Toronto, but one of them now lives in Liverpool. There was a man from Nashville and a young lady from Michigan. We all sat around chatting until it was almost dark. Another person wandered in sometime in the night and slept in a hammock (bear burrito) in the tent area with their dog, but I didn't meet them. I got my fill of water, but I'm having a hard time staying hydrated. I need to be cognizant of that.","Deer Lick Shelter

Sixty Horse,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544920,"August 2ndTuesday morning and I was up before sunrise hoping to be gone before anyone woke. It rained and hailed yesterday afternoon so I didn't bother with my stove. I hadn't drunk coffee since Sunday morning, but surprisingly felt no adverse effects. I packed my gear quietly, but managed to wake one of the guys from Toronto. I asked his name, nobody had mentioned names the night before. His name was Dave. If I'd given him a trail name, it would have been Stretch, because he was constantly stretching out because he had a back issue and adamantly refused to have surgery.        The trail was mucky in spots, but for once I'm not complaining. After I left the shelter the trail descended three-hundred fifty feet in seven tenths mile. I took a photo at Raven Rock Cliff and turned to find a Black Bear staring at me from fifty yards away. He had a thick shiny coat and appeared healthy. I guessed him at two-hundred fifty pounds and lucky for me, he sprinted off in the opposite direction. I was surprised how swiftly and quietly he blended into the surrounding woods. I might be ignorant, but I hadn't expected to see bear in Maryland.        I warily proceeded down the trail and nearly came unhinged when a chipmunk jumped beside me. After crossing Raven Rock Road I began looking for water. I didn't want a repeat of yesterday's stupidity. I filled up at Little Antietam Creek just to be safe. Creeks, ponds, or springs are the same to me, regardless of what people might say. I filter everything.         At Ensign Cowall Shelter the spring is intermittent and stagnant and I'm glad I have plenty of water, because from here to the Pogo Memorial Campsite is five miles in length and the A.T. Guide book provides no detail. The trail is easy to moderate along this stretch and I'm finding dry pieces of kindling for my stove while I amble along. My ankle seems to be on the mend. Things might be looking up.        Referencing the A.T. Guide I notice that Black Rock Cliffs are ahead and I wince, more rocks. Rock hopping is becoming second nature as I leave the cliff and head for the next photo spot. When I read Annapolis Rocks, I was expecting some kind of entertainment there, but only find a huge rock overlook facing west, imagine that. However, the view was beautiful and there was a good spring, so I took advantage of that.        When I got to Pine Knob Shelter, it was crawling with energetic young men even though it was only a five person shelter. I went for water at the nearby spring and was lucky to avoid being hit by a large falling branch, another good omen. A park employee was onsite and she listened to my wet wood sob story and said she'd lend me her gas stove. I nonchalantly refused the gracious offer confident that today's scavenged wood was certainly dry. It wasn't.         I pitched my tent while wrestling with whether or not to use my rain fly. Though it was quite warm, I still opted for the fly. I worked the stove for an hour and managed to get a small smoldering fire started, but it wasn't hot enough to bring water to a boil. However, it did warm things slightly. I was on the phone complaining to Cindy about my ongoing wood dilemma when she recommended I eat the dehydrated stuff as is. She said soak it in water it's cooked already. Now why didn't I think of that? Just after midnight the skies let loose.","Raven Rock Shelter

Sixty Horse,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544921,"August 3rdPine Knob Shelter was less than a mile from I-70, so it wasn't quiet. However, the whining of the semi tires blowing up and down the road was somehow soothing. I had plenty of lukewarm and partially rehydrated food in my gut so I slept well. The rain blasted away at my tent and I was pleased that I'd used the fly. I hoped my gear stayed dry in the vestibule, but it didn't.        The tent's pad had a slope to it, but I hadn't noticed that last night. I did notice it when I got up though. Everything that was stowed in the vestibule was soaked. I strapped my light on and began to break camp. I'd have to settle for trail mix again this morning and hopefully whip up a meal somewhere along the way. I had topped up my water, so that wasn't an issue. Crossing the interstate's footbridge was disconcerting as trucks and cars flew past, but why shouldn't it be confusing? I was half asleep and staggering and everything I wore or carried was wet. It was only six-thirty.        Perhaps I had overly ambitious plans for the day. It called for reaching the Ed Garvey Shelter. Sixteen and a half miles isn't undoable. I took a break at Washington Monument, filled my water bottles, snacked a bit, and phoned Cindy. It was eight o'clock. Dahlgren Backpack Campground was little more than two miles away. They offered free hot showers for thru-hikers. That sounded like a wonderful idea. I picked up my pace and arrived there by before ten. Hot showers meant hot water, and hot water was what I needed for my thermos.        After showering I enjoyed a lunch of slightly warm chili and pasta, afterward I rinsed my thermos out and stuffed it with tonight's meal soaked in warm water. I referenced the A.T. Guide for the upcoming journey. Eleven miles with an elevation increase of nearly eight-hundred feet. I considered things as I sipped chlorinated water drawn from the bathroom faucet. Crampton Gap Shelter was only seven miles, but it had an intermittent spring. It wasn't an option.        Wearing clean damp socks and the same dirty clothes, I hoisted the heavy backpack onto my shoulders. I had serious reservations about the remaining trek, but saw no way around it. I checked my watch and calculated that I had six and a half hours if I expected to reach Ed Garvey by six. I passed Rocky Run Shelters and the elevation began to increase, so did the amount of rocks and size of them. An eight-hundred feet incline was certainly going to test me.        My ankle had stopped throbbing and was now only a dull ache. I could live with that. I was nearly to Lambs Knoll Tower Road, when I felt a stinging pain inside my right shoe. I had a bad feeling about that, but forged ahead anyway. I had no option, I couldn't stop. There wasn't time.         I reached the shelter at ten past six. I needed water. The A.T. Guide stated the spring was four-tenths mile down a steep grade. I was shattered as I began the descent. Unfortunately, the guide was wrong. I measured the return trip from the spring and found it to be three-quarter mile each way. I hadn't needed that. Nobody else came to the shelter that evening and I once again failed to get a fire started. I talked with Cindy and learned that she'd ordered fire starters for me, all I needed to do was wait a couple more weeks. I was in bed by nine.","Pine Knob Shelter

Sixty Horse,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544926,"August 4thLast night I had the shelter to myself, but still didn't sleep well. The telltale pain in my right foot was extremely troubling. I lay there and thought about the upcoming rendezvous with Cindy. It was supposed to be in three weeks in Roanoke, Virginia, not in the next day or so and only sixty miles from where I started. The end game was to be Georgia, not here. I'd been shut down before because of the troublesome nerve condition in my foot that related back to the back surgery I'd undergone a year earlier, but didn't want it to happen again.        I forced my eyes closed and tried to sleep, but relaxation was all but impossible. All the planning and conversations that surrounded or had been related to the hike kept swimming around in my head. Was there something I could have done different? What if I'd only hiked eight miles a day. Questioning the how and why of my position did little to help me sleep. I'd just have to see what tomorrow brought.        I had strange disjointed dreams that evening that related to anything but the Appalachian Trail. I woke early as usual and felt a little bit better. I walked around the shelter in flip flops as I tested my foot. It didn't hurt too much. The sun came up I gave my foot a thorough examination. There wasn't a single indication of a problem, but I could still feel the numbness creeping into my toes. I ate some cold oatmeal and packed up my gear and hit the trail by eight. It was my latest start yet.        My original plan had been to make it to David Lesser Memorial Shelter that evening and Bears Den Hostel the night after that. I had a drop box with a week's food waiting there. Three miles from the trail the descent increased dramatically with more rocks. My ankle was sore, but its pain was now overshadowed by the nerve endings screaming in my foot. I was extremely disappointed when I determined that I wasn't going to be able to do it. I limped down the steep decline and onto the C&O Canal Towpath.        I phoned Cindy with the bad news from there. I told her that I wasn't going to continue. She questioned me at first, are you sure you've been planning this so long. She knew how disappointed I was and said she would find a hotel and drive to Harpers Ferry and join me that evening. She had a seven hour drive to make. I was glad for the break, but that wasn't what I wanted. I ate a big burger in town. Even though I was starving it did little for my mood. Cindy had arranged for lodging at the Econo Lodge, but check in wasn't until three. I rode the shuttle up to the visitor's center to kill time.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Sixty Horse,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545155,"August 9thBack home in Kentucky, but I don't feel good about it. My desire to hike the AT in its entirety has come to an end. It was fraught with not only errors, but tons of miscalculations. I knew from the get-go that it was a stretch. I knew the issue with my right foot hadn't disappeared and that it could resurface at any time, which it did, but I still wanted to do it. I am glad for the experience and I'm much more familiar with my own limitations because of it.        Over the past few months, whenever I would try to string some long hikes together, say a couple of fifteen milers, my right foot would start to let me know about it. My neurologist told me that it was doubtful that the numbness in my foot would ever go away completely. I knew that was a possibility, but still elected to ignore it. The numbness ends up masking what is really going on, until it's too late. At the end of my hike on the AT, my foot was on fire. I expected to find blisters the size of quarters on my right foot after I removed my shoe. There were none.        To make a long story short, an extended hike stretching weeks on end is not a viable option. My stamina is good, but my foot, not so much. Twenty-two hundred miles is definitely out of the question. I'm down, but I'm not out. I will be back, but I'll be back with a different attitude and a different goal. I will hike parts of the trail at my leisure, maybe an overnight covering twenty or thirty miles, a hike that doesn't rattle my troublesome foot.         I admire the people that are out there giving it their all and hope they achieve their goal. They're a tenacious group and more power to them, but I won't be there. I'll get a few more miles on the AT though, before I call it quits. As a matter of fact, I'm planning to do a couple more overnights in early September. See you on the trail and have a good hike.","Harpers Ferry
