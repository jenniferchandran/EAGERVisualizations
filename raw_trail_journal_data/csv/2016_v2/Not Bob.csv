Not Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520145,"I have been section hiking for a while so that preparation consists mostly of deciding which gear to take and which to leave home. I'm starting in late March so I anticipate crowded camping areas - I almost never sleep in shelters. I can always find a place to hang my hammock, but I'm sure I'll have some cold nights. The alternative is the Mountainsmith Shelter LT. I'll probably bring the hammock and use the Big Agnes Insulated Air Core for insulation along with a DIY pad made from a dollar store car sun-shield. I can always go to ground in the hammock.I should bring my DIY down top-quilt, although it's overkill and heavy and bulky. I've been warm in the Marmot NanoWave 45 down to the mid 20s, albeit while wearing all of my clothes.",,Preparation,"Jan 25, Mon",0
Not Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523059,"My departure date has snuck up on me. I'm buying Megabus tickets today and made a reservation at the Hiker Hostel near I'm dealing with logistic of getting my prescriptions on the trail. Also, I'll be voting absentee and I have to apply for a ballot.I think I'm bringing my tent instead of the hammock - it's bound to be cold in March and early April.",,Prep #2,"Mar 10, Thu",0
Not Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524243,"I have very little left to do with regard to the hike but a lot of other loose ends to tie up. I have to make some decisions about what cold weather gear to take. I'm wearing my trail runners, so I hope it doesn't snow much. I might bring gators.I need to spray my clothes & tent with premithin, buy food and batteries and that's about it. I arrive in Atlanta early Friday, get a shuttle to the Hiker Hostel and start walking Saturday.I'm in good swimming shape but not so good walking shape. Swimming helps with the poles, but I expect to be sore for the first few days. This is not unusual for me - to get in shape while I walk.Once I'm in shape I'm aiming for 12 miles per day or so. With Daylight savings time I might go a little further. This is much less than the 20+ mile days I did before my illness.I'm getting a new larger phone and leaving my Kindle home. I need to bookmark this and a bunch of other sites. On the trail I mostly use voice to text and the type for editing.Checking the weather now. I'll journal after Day 1.",,Prep #3,"Mar 21, Mon",0
