Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511365,"Many, ok everyone asks why I'm doing this blah, blah, blah is this a midlife crisis etc. Answer- NO, this is something that I always wanted to do but had different priorities throughout my life. Started working right out of school, built house, married had kids and many responsibilities and NOW.Now is my turn and this is what I have decided to do. I will section hike NOBO for 1-2 weeks each year until I completed thru Maine. src='http://www.trailjournals.com/images/faces/smile.gif'>I do admire the younger group that are taking this on right out of college etc. and I would never talk someone out of it. But since that option has sailed here I go.",,View Entry,"Aug 25, Tue",0
Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511369,"Hi Everyone- So, I had my first dress rehearsal hike on Saturday and hiked 6 miles in 2 hours which in Florida during these summer months isn’t shabby. My pack weight was and should remain at 20 lbs. 8 oz.Perhaps I will strive to hike the “Ocean to Lake” - “Lake to Ocean” whichever way you want to look at it, this November during cooler weather. This is in Florida close to my home and runs from Lake Okeechobee east to the Atlantic Ocean in Hobe Sound which is 61.7 miles.",,View Entry,"Aug 26, Wed",0
Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512340,"Good Morning Hikers; I have used this quote for many years and wanted to share with you all, My 9th grade Journalism teacher once wrote this in my yearbook and I never forgot it. 
""May mushy mayonnaise moisten the hard surfaces of the trails stony path"" - Mr. Nalepa (MIami Norland).","

Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512445,"I thought I would share this although many of you may have seen it:If something should happen during this long journey, spare me the mundane fade of natural causes, the gentle expire in the dark of the night. Take me rudely, in a frantic gnashing of claws and canines in the wilderness. Unleash your vipers, your flash floods, your stampeding wildfires. Give me the awful clarity of freefall, the made carnival ride of avalanche. Drag these well-used bones from the trail into one final glorious maelstrom of discovery – and while you’re at, release the damn kraken. I’ve lived well, I’ve adventured widely, and I will not die poorly. ---Jonathan Dorn","

Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532107,"So, I arrived at Springer Mountain Parking area at 6:00 pm. My driver Sam was a trip, told a heartfelt story and I joked with him when he said ""This job is great therapy for me"" Laughed and said to him how he charges $55.00 for the ride and I happen to charge $55.00 to listen to people so we're even (LOL). Sam directed me towards the So. Terminus which you have to hike back towards and is a 2 mile round trip, so I hiked the .8 miles to Springer Shelter as the rain was beginning. I found my camp spot, pitched my tent and hurried to the shelter to cook dinner. No sooner than finishing cleaning up, the sky opened up and I was in my tent safe and dry.","Springer Mountain

Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532111,"Started my hike at 9:30 am taking pictures and signing the trail log book, the hike to Hawks Mountain was beautiful and no rain made it even better. The climb was OK, steep at times. Had lunch at Stover Creek Shelter which was awesome, after a rest I began my trek towards Hawk Mountain. Met some thru and section hikers and talked trail, then set up tent and then....Yes, the rain came. I think Mama Nature waited until my tent was set up again. She's thoughtful .","Springer Mountain Shelter

Met Dream Chaser, Chad, Peter and a hiker named Wolfgang from Germany, trail name, ""The Wolf"". Great guy and on his second visit/hike on the AT.","Hawk Mountain

Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532132,"The Wolf arrived at my tent this morning and I was talking to my daughter on the phone, I had cut her short by saying that I have to go, the Wolf is at my tent. Forgetting to tell her about my new friend, she called right back crying and I had to explain. Made it to Neels Gap with The Wolf and as soon as we arrived at Mountain Crossings I was ready for a pizza and a Coke. Upon walking into the store, the young man behind the counter yells out ""Wolfgang""! Remembering the wolf from his 2012 hike where they drank a few beers in the Hostel there. The Wolf is quite the celebrity here on the AT.As the other hikers I recently met began arriving we decided to have dinner at Armadillos Restaurant about 12 miles into town. Great fun, food and spirits although it was hard to finish my meal as my stomach must have shrank, lol.","Gooch Mountain

Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532275,"Received a phone call from 2 fellow hikers, a nice couple who I met was ahead of me about 2 miles north of Hogpen Gap and hurt his knee. It is 41 degrees out and the wind feels like 35 cutting through me. I backtracked to my car which is parked at Neels Gap and drove to Hogpen, parked and hike north for the 2 miles without a pack so I can carry his pack down where he won't do anymore damage to his knee. Helen Ga. is 15 minutes away so I drove them there and they checked into the Hampton Inn. This is a cool town set in German architecture. He and his wife were so appreciative they took Jimmie (another helpful hiker)and I for lunch.
Epilog:
So, as I have not fully completed what I hoped for, which was to finish Georgia's AT. I have endured things I have never done, I've spent multiple day's hiking the Appalachian Trail, Hitch-hiked to get to and from towns, spent nights in my 2' X 6' tent, carried all of my belongings on my back, encountered pain yet smiled and even laughed, shared a cabin with a stranger from Germany, Wolfgang ""The Wolf"" who instantly became a great friend. I met new friends from around the globe that I continue to stay in touch with. I want to thank my family and friends for the support, encouragement and listening to me talking about this venture for the past 2 years. I have learned that I have to re-evaluate my training, lighten my backpack as I return to the next journey of where I left off on the AT.
  As I walk
alone on this well-traveled path
Through my moans you’ll hear me laugh
Hike your
own hike past trekkers will preach,
The Fatigue
of my body until the next shelter I reach
 
The terrain
is hard yet so enlightening
Despite ones
thoughts it’s far from frightening
 
New hikers
you’ll meet each and every night
Exchanging
stories before hiker midnight
 
You try to
sleep but your body’s too sore
You try to
listen “is that a bear I hear roar”
 
The light
has come a new day is here
Crawl out of
your tent and re-pack your gear
 
Repeat your
day on the new terrain
The scenery
changes but not the pain
 
I don’t feel
like eating but can’t be frail
you need
your energy on this Appalachian Trail!
 
The AT is
addicting It’s hard to explain
Loving every
step even though my complain
 
I love
hiking this trail I cannot expound
It is my
passion, this new love I’ve found
 
I can’t
define it when friends ask me why,
Why do you
do this and I smile and sigh.

Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576315,"It was bitter cold last night and the rain never stopped although my tent was dry and my bag was warm :). Gorgeous day after rain stopped however, A cool morning walk until noon (which took me that long to get my hiking legs going) and warmed up enough to shed some clothes. Hiked with Tiny Dancer a little bit and met up at the shelter later that afternoon. Have to say I was beat but enjoyed the walk. I never want to hike fast and miss out on the trail surroundings so took my time until Hogpen which realized the need to hustle to get to Low Gap shelter in which I got there by 4ish. AS I approached Low Gap, a SOBO hiker informed me of a bear sighting at Low Gap but I never saw one. Set-up camp, loaded up on water from the creek, ate and rested before turning in which was accelerated by wind and rain. I saw hikers still coming in and setting up camp in the rain/wind while warm in my quarters. C'mon hiker midnight!Happy Trails, PB (Bob)","Neels Gap

Party Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576335,"Another cold night and even bundled up in my 30 degree bag, I was cold. I'm thinking it was 33 last night and the wind howled all night. Another nice morning, up at 6, had a pop-tart, packed up moved on, first one out on trail, nice morning for a brisk walk. This was a nice gradual trail from the top of Low Gap for the first 5 miles AND THEN.... The ascend and descend on large boulders that was the trail, one SOBO hiker laughed when I mentioned the terrain and he said WAIT until PA (Rocksvilvania). Upon arriving at Blue Mountain Shelter, I hit the spring before the shelter and filled up H2O, walked the short distance to the shelter and hardly made it before dropping my pack and laying in the shelter to rest, even fell asleep :). Pitched my tent, cleaned up and ready for dinner. A handful of hikers joined me and I gathered wood for a fire. Relaxing by the fire as darkness and cold set in, although it wasn't as cold.As I walk
