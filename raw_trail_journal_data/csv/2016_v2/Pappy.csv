Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513675,"My journey to the trail began last summer. While sitting around a local restaurant some colleagues and I were trying to come up with something new and different to enhance the education of our students. I mentioned I was reading a book by an author named Paul Stutzman (Trail name Apostle). The book was entitled Hiking Through: One Man's Journey to Peace and Freedom on the Appalachian Trail. I shared Apostle's story and someone suggested I email him to see if he would like to come to our county in MD to speak to our students about his journey. Holding my breath, and having no idea what he would say, I emailed him. Within minutes he replied and said he would love to. ""That's very serendipitous!"" stated a coworker, and so was born the Serendipitous Speakers Series, and my journey to the AT.While setting up the auditorium for Apostle's event, a young African American male approached me. He was the quintessential don't judge a book by its cover story. Pants around his hind end, stove pipe hair, gold chains.... ""Excuse me, sir."" He began the conversation. ""Is this for the speaker tonight?"" I replied it was and he asked if anyone could come and I assured him they could. I asked if he wanted to come and he said yes. I told him if he did, I would introduce Apostle to him and buy him a copy of his book. Over dinner, I told Apostle about the young man and really didn't think much more about it. As the talk was winding down I turned around and saw the young man, sitting in the last row of people, by himself. I went over to him and commented that he made it. ""I promised you I would."" he said. ""Okay, I'm going to keep my promise. Let's go meet Apostle."" He was surprised that I was going to hold up my end as much as I was he did his. To his credit, Apostle made a huge deal over meeting the young man, I bought a book for him and Apostle autographed it. Before he left, Apostle asked the young man if he hiked. ""Well, I walk to school."" he said, looking down at the floor. ""That's a good start."" Apostle replied. ""Tomorrow, go find some woods and walk into them. Just a little ways. And the next day, go a little further. Do that for several days and you will find yourself hiking. He left clutching his new book closely to his chest. A very powerful moment, and I thought I had seen the last of the young man. A few months later I ran into him again. He asked if I ever talked to Apostle and I said we did keep in touch via social media. He asked me to share the following message. ""Please tell him I am hiking, and tell him I found myself out there."" He walked away and I stood there like a fool, tears flowing down my cheeks much like they are now as I write this over a year later. Through Apostle and this kid, I saw the power of the AT. Tomorrow, just for a weekend, I will take those first few steps into the woods of the Appalachian Trail. Over the course of the next several months I will prepare to begin my thru walk. Unfortunately, a job and fortunately, a family, will prevent me from doing it all in one large chunk and I may have to do it in two years and by flip-flopping, but it is my goal, no, heart-felt need, to walk the AT. Tomorrow, I will begin at the nearest point to my home in Maryland, Harper's Ferry. My goal is to go the first 16 miles over the two and a half days I'll be there. I've spent the last several months gathering gear and supplies. Trying foods, testing this and that. I have finally found a weekend with no kids activities, no work responsibilities. It's time. Tomorrow, I take those first steps in finding myself.","

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513749,"This afternoon it begins. The pack is ready, feeling slightly heavy and my knees are already hurting, but I think it's more sympathy pains than anything. Prayers to be said and last minute things to wrap up and I'll probably pack and repack a few more times. Here we go!","Harper's Ferry

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513930,"Day one was to summarize in one word, brutal. The lady at the Trail Conservancy in Harper's Ferry said that once you get to the top of South Mountain it's an easy walk. I should have delved deeper into ""once you get to the top."" 
As I began my ascent up South Mountain I was full of excitement and apprehension. Going alone, people had been constantly telling me I was nuts. ""What if you gethurt?"" ""What if you run into someone who is nuts?"" The latter of which made me chuckle as they recommended I take my 13 year old son. I assured them I would be fine. 
Now, I was taking those first steps. Crossing under Route 340, upon which there was a sign that read ""Appalachian Trail."" I had thought many times about where the trail went under the bridge. I was surprised to see the trail was the bridge! Well, the foundation actually. That was surprise number one, and the first wow moment for me. A few feet after I came across a hiker who was leaning on a rock. I asked if he was alright and he explained he was taking part in some 47 mile challenge, crossing all of MD in one continuous hike. He showed me his watch which indicated he had already hiked for 14 hours, meaning he started at midngight! I ensured him he had just a short easy walk then he would be on the C&O Canal Tow Path which was flat and even and he was just two miles from the finish line in Harper's Ferry. We bid each other well and moved on. 
I'm glad he didn't tell me what was in store for me. In all my years of football and wrestling practices, never had I done something that physically demanding. The hike was bad enough, but the extra 30lbs on my already grossly overweight body, every step burned. I kept telling myself that every step also brought me closer to the shelter. Just one more step....
After hours of climbing, I finally made it. Exhausted. Too exhausted to be excited. I still had miles to go and every part of my body wanted to stop, but I wanted to move on. After another two hours, I considered stealthing for the night. It didn't feel like I was getting any closer and I was just tuckered out. Then, the first bit of trail magic. I caught a whiff of camp fire. I figured I was too far out for this to be anything but what I hoped it would be. I bound forward with new energy and it was only a bit longer before I saw my first blue blaze. Ed Garvey Shelter. Finally! 
Approaching the shelter I was a bit taken aback. I heard lots of talking but couldn't understand a word of it. As I came over the rise I saw five gentlemen from India sitting around the fire. I said hello and one, I assume the leader, said hello to me. The others nodded a lot and kept chattering. Then I saw the guides come around the corner. They were a group of guys from NJ out for a team building exercise. My thoughts...How dare they look this fresh having just climbed that mountain! I would later find out they were hiking south. But I enjoyed their company that first evening. 
Still exhausted and almost too tired to cook, I was considering just eating breakfast bars when one of the guides offered me left over noodles. Now, let me tell you, there was only five cold penne pasta noodles, and they had nothing on them, but they were wonderful. I finally had enough energy to make myself some soup. By 8:00pm, the day was done, I had my spot in the shelter and was off to sleep. 
Then, I realized something. A 52 year old man who has to get up a couple of times to go to the bathroom every night, is still a 52 year old man who has to get up and go to the bathroom every night. Difference: You have to put the shoes on, strap on the head lamp and traipse through the woods go. Oh, and at home, if I see little green lights staring back at me, I know it's a dog or cat. Out on the trail....who knows.
Morning came much too soon, but did so with a brilliant sunrise right into the front of the shelter. I somehow managed to fight off the muscle spasms in my legs and crawled out of my sleeping bag. Breakfast consisted of those bars I had saved from the day before and the little bit of water I had left. The stream was a half a mile over a steep hill and I was just too tired to go get some. Besides, I only had about 4 miles to the next stop at Crampton Gap and water. 
At 8:15 I headed out, having bid farewell to my new friends and taken a moment to sign the log. In it, I thanked Apostle for writing his book and being such an inspiration. The walk was much easier that second day, but I was really having issues with leg cramps and off all things, a muscle spasm in my right buttocks. It was a recurring thing I had suffered on long hikes as of late, but it was really bad with the heavy pack. The walking was slow. Too slow. But sometimes, these things happen for a reason, this time it was magic number three. Seeing some day hikers coming my way, I stopped to let them pass. Now, there was no reason to do so. The trail was wide enough for all of us, but I wanted a reason to rest. As they passed, I looked to my right and there in front of me was the Glenn Gaveney Wilderness Memorial. It took me a second to realize it was just a memorial and not a site of internment, but what an awesome thing to see and think about. I would love my family to do this for me someday. 
Trail magic number four was soon to follow. At some point I found a hiking partner. A very loud, obnoxious and mean crow. It followed me down the trail, squawking, yelling and swooping down towards me. Never close enough to be a threat, but really just annoying. It went on for over half a mile. I found myself speaking to God. ""God, I don't get it. You let Apostle see a butterfly, but I get a crow! Is there something you're trying to tell me?"" A few more steps and it dawned on me, everything had become quiet. I stopped, looked up the trail and realized the crow was gone. Had that not been enough, just ahead was a monarch butterfly! It was just dancing back and forth across the trail. I laughed out loud and thanked God for the vote of confidence and started walking. The little gift from heaven stayed with me for the next mile until I came across my final hiking partners for the day. 
I knew I was getting much closer to civilization. The number of joggers and day hikers was increasing dramatically. I really knew it when a couple walked by me, the man dressed in hiking gear and she was wearing a dress. A pretty green dress and flats. As she passed I was taken by her perfume. She smelled wonderful. I almost turned and commented, but just laughed inside when I thought how odd that would sound, a sweaty guy, in the middle of the woods carrying a 30lb pack, commenting on a woman's perfume. My final partners I had passed a bit earlier, they with their old lab, she in a dress, he dressed to hike. I was feeling a pattern. They had passed me earlier going in the opposite direction, but had turned around and came back. It was nice to have a bit of company for a while. But all too soon, we came to Crampton Gap, and a refill of water and lunch. 
I walked on a bit further to Crampton Shelter only to find it full of college aged kids whooping it up. They had set up camp for the day and it was obvious I wasn't going to be sleeping here. Taking account of everything, the distance to the next shelter, the continued cramps in my legs and hind end, I decided to stop for the weekend. It had been a very nice almost 24 hours. I had only covered 10 miles or so on the trail. But, I learned that I could do it. I could take on South Mt, I could carry 30lbs while doing it. I could go four miles short on water. I could do it and still find a way to enjoy my surroundings and have a chat with God. It was okay to stop here. I knew I would be back. 
In sharing my couple of days with my college roommate and best friend, he said he would love to join me next time. We'll be shopping for equipment soon. Hoping to go in October when he has some vacation time. I think I would like to finish hiking through MD at least. 
As I was driven away from the trail I looked back and saw that great big ridge line. I had done it. I had climbed that mountain and walked that entire section. It didn't matter that it took all of six or seven minutes to drive it. I had walked it, and in doing so learned some things about myself. I learned that the drive I had as a young kid in high school and college was still there. Hidden by years behind a desk, a little too heavy for his own good, but it was still there, it just needed to be dusted off. I could hear my coaches in my ear, ""Quit? Never heard of the word. Are you sure it's an English word?"" I learned to trust in the trail. Magic will happen when you need it, not when you want it. I learned that God still walks with me and answers me when I call out his name. It may have only been two days, but it was a lesson I will not soon forget. 
Next, I will continue to hike and walk and to get into better shape. I will also continue planning a much longer hike, though I have to figure out a way to join that with my work. It can be done, but how much are my bosses willing to let me go? If you need me, I'll be the silly looking guy walking around my community with my pack on, building up the legs. God bless you all.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514243,"It's been a few days since I ended my first weekend hike. It's odd how it just gets in your blood. Every moment of down time is spent thinking about getting back on the trail. Every dream at night is about being back on the trail. They say a woman forgets the pain of child birth immediately after, and that is what allows them to have more children. (I've had kidney stones and the nurses said the pain is exactly the same. I remember that pain and wouldn't want another. Perhaps that's why women are tougher!) Even though those first days were brutal, with the South Mountain climb and the ever tightening calf cramps, they are all forgotten and I can't wait to get back out there. I've managed to hook my old college roommate on the idea and we are going to be back on the trail in October. My goal is to finish hiking through Maryland. Of course I get to go shopping with him first, and spend HIS money on all of the gear. I've seen other changes in my attitude as well. Prior to taking on the challenge of the AT, I used to do a tremendous amount of walking. Just walking. Trying to rid years of abuse on my body and get my weight and health back to acceptable ranges. As I saw another walker I would think, ""good for you!"" Today, I saw a guy walking along a sidewalk near my son's school and I blurted out, ""Try that with 30lbs on your back and find a hill to climb."" My son just shook his head. Don't get me wrong, the guy was walking and good for him, but yeah, throw 30lbs on your back pal! I've put my back pack in my van and whenever I get the chance I put on some boots, the pack and take a walk. I've received more than one odd stare as I walk around my office building or on a nearby walking/biking trail. Especially with a tie on. I want to thank those who have taken a moment out of their day to share advice or a kind word. I appreciate them all very much. God bless you all! Pappy","

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514904,"Finally! I have solidified my return date to the trail. I'll be spending four glorious days beginning October 20. It should feel odd to say ""glorious"" when I'll be lugging a pack, but I can't wait. 
This weekend I'll be shopping with my friend, trail name to be decided, and spending his money on equipment. He's pretty quick, he's already caught on that we don't need to double up on gear. ""Well, I won't need a stove. And you can carry the tent..."" See, he already has a plan. 
I have found myself having a hard time getting to sleep at night. I've also found a way to help. I close my eyes, and pretend I'm in a shelter. I feel the breeze coming through the window, listen to the night sounds, and I find myself comforted. There is magic out there. I hope my friend experiences it.","Back to the trail!

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515326,"I learned a very important thing this past Sunday, it's more fun to spend other people's money when preparing for a hike. After my last trip out on the trail, I told my old college roommate, the one who doesn't like grass, about it and he wants to go in two weeks. But, he had to gear up first. When I got to his house I took in my pack, sans tent and a lot of food, for him to try out. As he walked around his living room proclaiming ""This ain't so bad. I can do this!"" I just smiled. 
Over the next three hours we spent $500 of his money on the bare essentials of a pack, shoes, sleeping bag and assorted odds and ends. I enjoyed that and it cost me dinner as I felt too guilty making him pay after all of that, but it was worth it. 
What was more worth it was the after party. We drove to the spot on the trail where we are going in and hiked a half mile or so up it. As it is all uphill, he was panting pretty hard, and he didn't have his pack on! The quote of the day, ""We're going to take our time, right? Take breaks whenever we want? Right?"" Yep, I said, the rule is we hike our own hike. ""That's a good idea."" He said. 
I told him he needed a trail name. He kept trying out names from every manufacturer we saw. ""Maybe Field and Stream? Whadda ya think?"" He finally gave up and I bestowed upon him something from his college days. As he was a basketball player, I dubbed him ""Hard Court."" He took to it right away. 
As I'm finishing my umpteenth book on the walking the trail, I realize they all have the same theme in common, someone ""running"" away from something. Not always a negative thing, as many are going to heal as they walk. I've thought long and hard about this. What am I running from? Lord knows there are lots of things I can claim, but after deep thoughtful meditation and prayer and found myself thinking I'm running TO something. As a kid growing up in WV, it was nothing for me and my friends come Friday afternoon, to grab some flour and sugar, our .22 rifles and head for the woods for the weekend. We would pick out a spot and build a lean-to, set up camp and start foraging for sassafras, berries, crayfish from the stream and the occasional squirrel. We would eat like kings for the weekend. During the day we would work to make camp better, go talk to the local folks on the hill and see if we could get them to offer anything from their garden. We never took! At night, a camp fire and ghost stories. 
Although it once almost turned tragic. One of my friends, Denzil, told a particularly scary tale of an Indian roaming the woods scalping people at night. We knew better, of course, but in the middle of the night it was quite the tale. A little more on Denzil. He was and still is, the quintessential mountain man. At the time, he wore baggy shorts, long hair, a baseball cap on backwards with a feather in it and in the woods, he carried his axe. In the middle of the night the fire was dying down and Denzil decided to go get some firewood. As he returned I woke up to see this almost 6 foot tall creature, shadowed by the fire, with what looked like a loin cloth, long hair from which a feather was sticking up and carrying a tomahawk raising it to cut a piece of firewood! I screamed, most likely like a little girl, and grabbed for my gun. If not for a well placed, ""Whatdahell's wrong with you?"" from him I might just have started shooting! I didn't sleep the rest of the night, but we still laugh about it to this day. 
Anyway, I really digressed. I think I'm running to that simpler life. Yes, I'll still have a phone, but I'll be responsible for my own pace, my own survival and my own mindset. I can block all outside influences. I'm running to my memories of wonderful times. At least as much as I'm running from anything. Just two more weeks. Peace be with you all.","Back to the trail!

We knew better, of course, but in the middle of the night it was quite the tale. A little more on Denzil. He was and still is, the quintessential mountain man. At the time, he wore baggy shorts, long hair, a baseball cap on backwards with a feather in it and in the woods, he carried his axe. In the middle of the night the fire was dying down and Denzil decided to go get some firewood. As he returned I woke up to see this almost 6 foot tall creature, shadowed by the fire, with what looked like a loin cloth, long hair from which a feather was sticking up and carrying a tomahawk raising it to cut a piece of firewood! I screamed, most likely like a little girl, and grabbed for my gun. If not for a well placed, ""Whatdahell's wrong with you?"" from him I might just have started shooting! I didn't sleep the rest of the night, but we still laugh about it to this day. Anyway, I really digressed. I think I'm running to that simpler life. Yes, I'll still have a phone, but I'll be responsible for my own pace, my own survival and my own mindset. I can block all outside influences. I'm running to my memories of wonderful times. At least as much as I'm running from anything. Just two more weeks. Peace be with you all.","

Hard Court is bringing his brand spanking new equipment to the house this weekend so we can pack his pack. He's a little unsure of it all I think. He's also been placed in charge of getting the food and I can't wait to see what he gets. I have a feeling it will be a lot of pop tarts and beef jerky. At least that's what he has asked about so far. Fortunately, his equipment is getting broken in as his son has ""borrowed"" it and is out hiking on the AT for a few days this week.

I hope the leaves are changing and the walking is easy. Hard Court, who has now decided to call himself some snowman character from that movie Frozen, lent his gear to his son. The younger had this advice, ""Take lots of breaks and make them long ones. I was dying out there!"" I've got my empty Gatorade ""honey pot"" as suggested and we'll see.

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516199,"Yep, that first day was just less than a mile. It should have been a short jaunt up the hill to the shelter, but as life has it, it was full of humor. As we arrived at Gathland State Park, we saw two older fellows coming out of the woods on what was an unblazed trail of some kind. We didn't think much of it, as it was a pretty well worn path. After the obligatory picture taking we headed up the hill. Now hiking uphill is tough. With 30lbs, it's sheer H-E-double hockey sticks. I don't know why, but I always forget that. Well, we made it to the blue blaze that would lead us down to the Crampton Gap Shelter and as we started down we saw those two same fellars coming up the hill. They were quick to tell us they had walked over a mile down there and there was no shelter. Now, we were confused on a couple of levels. First, how in the world did those two guys get in front of us?! They sure as heck didn't pass us. Second, were they right? The sign at the intersection sort of pointed down the blue blaze, but it sort of kind of pointed up the trail too. ""Crampton Gap Shelter .25 miles."" It was clear enough on distance, but not direction. I looked at Hard Court as the two guys passed us going uphill assuring us we were going in the wrong direction. Then again, they had walked ""a mile"" down the hill and didn't see what was supposed to be a quarter mile down. After much debate, Hard Court decided to drop pack and just go look. Within 50 yards he came across the first tent site and yelled up to me. Well, that solved that I figured. The younger of the two guys kept referring to ""Boy Scout camp sites"" and I was pretty sure he was talking about the tenting site. Shaking our heads, we walked down to the shelter. Right where it was supposed to be. After setting things up we found a steady stream of guests. Mostly day hikers just coming by, but eventually two brothers came down and we were four for the night, or so we thought. Shortly after they arrived our first through hiker arrived, The Machine. He had flip-flopped at Harper's Ferry was was finishing up in a couple of days. He had some amazing stories of life on the trail and was an absolute joy to talk to. He kept us in stitches most of the evening. Now we were five and the inn was full. An hour later, the original two guys came back down! Saying they had gone ""a mile down the trail"" and couldn't find anything so they doubled back yet again! Seeing the shelter was full, they decided to set up camp on the deck, taking up much of the ""living and cooking space."" No one seemed to mind, especially me, I figured if a bear showed up they were first alarm and would be rather filling. But then the question of peeing in the middle of the night came up. The younger of the two asked if we thought we would be getting up to pee during the night. Now, he was asking five middle aged men if they were going to get up in the middle of the night. We assured him we would be getting up throughout the night and they thought the better of it and headed up for the ""boy scout camp."" We never saw them again. Sleep was not a friend. The one time I did manage to fall into a decent sleep, I was awakened by a sound outside the shelter, followed by Hard Courts knuckles pressing into my back as he rolled over in his sleep. Put the two together and BAM! I spun around, slapped his hand almost across the room and woke everyone up. As he was asking what I was doing, I was stammering I thought his hand was an animal nuzzling into me and I wasn't going to take a chance of, well, of anything! We all settled back down most with grunts of displeasure. That was everyone but The Machine. He never moved....for the entire night. He had obviously seen it all over the last six months.","Gathland State Park

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516202,"As mentioned in yesterday's entry, we met The Machine. Since I can't post two pictures in one entry, I decided to post our meeting of Machine here. Morning came on day two and we were off. Uphill...both ways...in the snow...barefoot...or so it felt. It never ceases to amaze me how rocky the trail is in MD. Pennsylvania might be the state boots go to die, but that's okay, because the feet are dead before they leave Maryland and the boots aren't needed anyway. The climbs were brutal, but actually not bad. Just being an overweight  middle aged guy....Fat...I'm fat and out of shape unless you call round a shape and if not for a lifetime of coaches behind me, pushing me, I would have no business being able to do this. So, thanks to all of my coaches who made me do one more lap, who convinced me that my mind would shut down before my body was hurt and I pushed on. Hard Court leading the way, getting 5 or 10 minutes ahead, sitting down, waiting for me to catch up and taking off again. All the while, I hiked. After reaching the peak of Lamb's Knoll, and taking in the incredible scenery, we took a break. I through the pad down, took the boots off and proceeded to take a 30 minute nap. Big mistake! While trying to put the socks back on CRAMPS!! Both calves and my groin. I was begging Hard Court to rub them out, but even after knowing each other 34 years, having been college roommates, him being the godfather of my oldest daughter...he was having none of touching my crotch. ""Some friend you are!"" I finally got myself together and down the mountain we went. We came across a lady walking the opposite direction with her dog. She assured us we didn't have much boulder field to go, it would smooth out soon. An hour and a half later we came to a road and there was the same lady! Hard Court asked how she managed to get in front of us. ""Oh, this road goes up to the cell phone tower you passed at the top. It only took me 8 minutes to get back down."" Eight minutes.....eight minutes?!! It took us an hour and a half through millions of rocks...arrrgh!"" I tried to calm Hard Court down and explain we weren't here to yellow blaze the roads. He would have none of it. Especially after she said she was waiting for us, which meant she knew where we would eventually be. I explained we weren't ""pink blazing"" either! We finally continued on the trail, Hard Court looking over his shoulder at me one last time, ""Eight minutes,"" and off he went. It was another 30 minutes before I saw him again....sitting...snacking....When I caught him he was at the trail to the Rocky Run Shelter. We had talked about staying there for the night, but had only gone five miles and had only two to go. We decided to go for the seven. About that time another person out for a walk came ambling by and struck up a conversation. I don't know what he was retired from, but he sure knew a lot about Lambs Knoll and the going on's up there. Suffice it to say, we thank those who protect us from harm, foreign and domestic, and we hiked on. Through the boulder field....up the mountain...another hour later and we were....at the end of Lamb's Knoll Road...the same road we talked to the lady on. Hard Court was once again beside himself. ""Why didn't she tell us the damn road came here?!"" I was hurting too much to even talk about it. The two miles down hill through boulders was too much. But we had arrived...and decided to go off trail, sleep at his house and slack pack the next day. Another night's not sleeping was not in the cards for him...or me.","Cramption Gap Shelter

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516203,"After an hour at the local AYCE breakfast buffet, we headed back to the trail and continued walking. The day was uneventful, except for the reminder of the day before. We had heard helicopters all over the place on Wednesday but couldn't figure it out. Well, someone had fallen from a cliff on Sugar Loaf Mountain, (not part of the AT) and we had been listening to all of the rescue and news helicopters. From what we understand, the guy lived, but it serves as another reminder of just how dangerous it is, even just hiking. We crossed the I70 Bridge and we were done. Tired...and done. We talked about spending the night at Pine Knob Shelter, but opted to just drive to Harper's Ferry and visit the Trail Conservatory. We would be glad we did. More on that in the last post of the trip. We did come to a conclusion over the three days on the trail. We realized everyone who is day hiking is a liar. Okay, not really, but they are horrible judges of distance. Half a mile...half a mile...everyone said the next this or that was only half a mile.... For the most part, we thanked them and kept going. We had checked the maps and knew it was more like a mile and a half. How anyone could mistake a half mile by three, I have no idea. How they can claim the boulder fields were ""easy going"" is beyond me. Of course, none of them had a pack on and those who did had day packs with sandwiches, fresh fruit and cold sodas in them. They were good-hearted folks who thought they were being helpful. I can't fault them for that.","Mt Nemo Road

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516204,"Over the last couple of entries I have mentioned The Machine. He had arrived on Tuesday, just within one days hike of finishing his through hike. He was going to stretch it into two days to allow his family time to fly in and join him for the last mile. After we finished our hike, Hard Court and I went to visit the Trail Conservancy. HC had never been there. Shortly after limping in, we heard the door open and to our surprise, The Machine was walking in with his family! It was an incredible moment. When he saw me and HC he introduced us to his wife and we were invited to take part in the celebration. I was honored to be asked. To have hiked nearly 2,200 miles, and to think about that accomplishment and to take part in those final moments, yes, I was honored. Finishing in Harper's Ferry seems like the perfect place, especially for me. Being from WV, it just seems fitting. But I have to be honest with myself. First, I am in no physical condition to do this right now. I've lost 70lbs, but have so many more to do. My knees are horrible from years of abuse in football and being overweight. I'm staving off knee replacement surgery as it is. What is odd is that after hiking for several days on the AT, my knees are about the only things that don't hurt! So, I'm going to spend the winter in the gym...truly working out with multiple goals in mind. First, get healthier. Second, get ready for longer and longer hikes. Yes, I would love someday to through hike, but work gets in the way at this time. Being a father with young kids does not in any way shape or form get in the way. I love being a father and being here for them is important. I plan on taking any or all of them on some hikes soon. They love the pictures, but I want them to see the beauty for themselves. To experience nature...poop in a privy. So, I will continue to look for lighter and lighter equipment, take lots of two-three day hikes. Prep...prep....prep.Until then, be safe out there and God bless.","

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517159,"Good morning everyone and happy birthday to the USMC. Thanks to all who served. Over the last several months, as I have prepared for my journey, both near and far, I have read several books. I read my first one just over a year ago and had the opportunity to meet the author as he came to my school system to speak to my students. I have mentioned that before, but will share more later. Since, I have just been picking out one book after another. Initially, I figured they would all be the same. Folks searching for healing or themselves. Listing all of the reasons they started their thru-hike followed by all of the same hot spots and highlights along the trail. Springer Mt., the NOC, Damascus, McAfee Knob, etc. I couldn't have been more mistaken. Each book, though sometimes mentioning the same places, all had different takes on each place. Yes, everyone had their reason to hike the AT, but not everyone seemed to be looking for something or running away from something. The latter is a good thing to know. As I have been asked many times why I want to thru-hike. ""What are you running from?"" I have been asked many times. I don't see it that way. I find myself running to...a simpler way of life. To be minimalistic. I suppose you can phrase that as I'm running away from the world as it is today, but in my mind it's the opposite. So, here is a list of the books I have read. When possible and I remembered the trail names I have used them, otherwise, it is the author(s) real name(s.)Hiking Through: One Man's Journey to Peace and Freedom on the Appalachian Trail(Apostle) This is the book that began it all for me. Apostle has written another five books, two of which are fiction. He is an amazing man and a phenomenal guest speaker. If you have the opportunity to have him come to your community, church, school, wherever, you must go hear him speak of his journey's. After doing the AT, he biked across America and has done so much more. Truly a must read in my opinion. Lost on the Appalachian Trail (Mayor) Truly not what I thought it would be about, but yet a great book. The first I have read on which a thru-hiker travels with his dog. I'm almost finished with this one and it was worth the time and money. Walking on the Happy Side of Misery (Model-T) Another good book. Great stories that actually had me laughing out loud. Skywalker-Close Encounters on the AT (Skywalker) He may be the only 6'11"" thru hiker. Another book with lots of funny stories, many based on the reception he received due to his height. A Walk in the Woods (Bill Bryson) I understand this book has been the inspiration for many a thru-hiker, and though it had chuckle moments, it wasn't my favorite. I think due to all of the hype and the release of the movie, which I did not see, my expectations were a little high. The Appalachian Trail Hiker: Trail Proven Advice for Hikers of Any Length (Victoria Logue and Frank Logue) Just as it sounds. It was full of good advice and not as heavy on the adventures side. It gave me some great insight in to preparing my pack. Legging It: Life Lessons Learned on the Appalachian Trail (Hoosier)A decent book. Hoosier is a retired pastor who related much of his hike to the Bible. The great insight I took from this book, never really having thought of it before, is that everyone in biblical times walked everywhere, aka HIKED! Sometimes hundreds of miles from one town to another. If you are a Christian, you will find this book enjoyable. If you are an atheist or agnostic, maybe not. On the Beaten Path: An Appalachian Pilgrimage (Rhymin' Worm)By far my second favorite book about the AT. Rhymin' Worm lives about 20 minutes from me and I would love to sit and chat with him sometime. Trail-er Trash Thoughts on an Appalachian Trail Thru-hike (Alexander Warzinski)I hate to say it, I don't remember much about this book. AWOL on the Appalachian Trail (AWOL)A very good book with lots of great insight. Definitely worth the time to read this one. Rethinking Life on the Appalachian Trail (Rethinker)My third favorite book and made even more fun by the fact Rethinker spent time hiking with and finishing on Mt. Katahdin with Apostle. Lots of great pictures with Rethinker and Apostle in this book. Rethinker truly provides his thoughts on life as he completed his thru-hike. 12 Steps to a Lighter Backpack (Steven Lowe) Some great tips, one of which led me to cut half of the handle off of my toothbrush just to save 1.5 ounces.Backpacking: Beginners Guide ((Adahy Hunt)Good tips, but similar to all of the others. AT Guide 2015 (AWOL)A must have for everyone. Period.Data Book 2015Another must have. Similar info as the AT Guide, but presented in a different format. This weekend I am off to hike Assateague Island down on the coast of Maryland. Looking forward to traipsing up and down the shore line and across the island. No shelters this time, throwing up the tent. Clear skies with temps in the upper 50's and lower 40's at night. Should be a great weekend! Happy reading and happy hiking!","Home

The weekend before Thanksgiving, I took the opportunity to drive to Charm, OH and visit Apostle at his most recent book signing. For those who do not know, Apostle wrote Hiking Through, and later wrote Biking Across America, after having done so. His recent book, Stuck in the Weeds, is just as excellent and details his trip by kayak on the Mississippi River and his hike on the Camino de Santiago across Spain. It was great to see him and catch up. His next adventure, set for next year, may just be his most amazing yet. But I'll leave that up to him to tell you. I hope everyone is well.

So, looks like the thru hike is postponed for at least another year. It was a good fight, but in the end economics won out and they couldn't afford the sabbatical and hire someone else to do my job. Such is life I suppose. On the good side, my plans for a wilderness survival summer bridge (a one or two week course taught to our magnet students over the summer) is on the right path and will most likely happen. In the mean time, it looks like the section hikes continue, and one is planned for May as Hard Court and I head for the Shenandoah National Park to hike it before all of the lucky hikers start coming through. It will also give me some time to plan some trail magic events. Everything happens for a reason and as Apostle says, we are where we are supposed to be.","

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523165,"Well, it's been a while since I last spent a few moments with the journal. Last week I took a little stroll on the C&O Canal Trail in Hancock, MD. Spent the first night at the Super 8 Motel, and it was quite a pleasant stay. Not the fanciest place, but comfortable, and inexpensive. The purpose of the hike was to shakedown some new equipment, shoes, tent, dry sacks, etc. The shoes did well, but for whatever reason, the toenails on my right foot took another beating. I had purchased some moisture wicking Under Armour socks and they were fabulous. I've been wearing the shoes everyday for the last month, including with my business suits. They are Merrell's and feel great. Never came close to even one blister. But my big toe and index toe on my right foot took a beating. Being a canal trail, the terrain was perfectly flat, so that shouldn't have been an issue. Im' still noodling through that one. The big surprise was the weather. It was supposed to be in the upper 30's with partly cloudy skies, but that was taken over by some lake effect snows from Ohio that dumped an inch of snow and dropped temps into the 20's. Lesson: A 40 degree Ozark bag, though light at 2.9lbs and terrific above 40 degrees, is darn near worthless in the 20's. The hike ended abruptly at 6:00am when I had decided that I was heading for stage 2 hypothermia and moving was the only thing that was going to help, and it did. My tent..which is now a tent for my kids to play in, was not water sealed at all and along with moisture from the outside, developed a great deal of condensation on the inside. Next hike I'll take my one person (the brand name escapes me) that I got for Christmas. The final lesson, really narrowing down food. I packed way too much for two people. My food bag was atrociously heavy. The only thing I gauged correctly was my water. I took 2.5 liters and still had just under 2 left, which would have been about right had I taken the time to make a hot breakfast. Live and learn....no one died or got sick, memories were made, lessons learned and it was still better than sitting in the man cave watching the television! Happy Hiking!","
