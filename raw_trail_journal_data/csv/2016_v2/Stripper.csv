Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531819,"Tomorrow is not only Mother's Day, but I will also receive my Master's in English. It is a huge accomplishment for me and I am extremely indebted to so many people who made it happen. I have had to endure heartache along the way, but I have also had a tremendous amount of support from my family and close fiends. I am so very blessed to have such a wonderful husband who loves me and supports me in every endeavor. He has been my rock these past couple of years. My kids have had to sacrifice so much of their time with me as well, but have never once complained. They are both married now and have children of their own. My daughter is expecting her first baby in October, she and her husband will give me my first grand son and I am excited about that. My grand daughter is 18 months old now and just a darling! I cannot ask for a better support system then what I have had over the years.",,Tomorrow's a huge day for me!,"May 07, Sat",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531821,"I am usually hitting the trail on Mother's Day, but this year is a bit different and cannot head out until June 6th this year. I'm good with it though because I'm gonna have a great hike no matter what.",,Happy Mother's Day!,"May 07, Sat",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535182,"Since my last entry I have received my Master's Degree in English and therefore am done with my schooling for the rest of my life! I have been to see my sweet little grand daughter, which was so much fun! She is just adorable. I have received my teaching assignments for next semester and I am super stoked because I'm teaching some new and different classes and last, but not least, I have been working as a standardized testing evaluator for a few weeks after the semester ends and before I hike and was promoted to team leader for the remainder of the project! It's a ton of fun and I got a nice raise! More hiking money!!!We are going to have cars with us this time, which will be different for us, but it will allow Karey and I to be able to not carry as much weight with us and to have some freedom when it comes to getting in and out of towns. Having Stella hiking with us may limit the places we are able stay at, so if needed, we can drive to a place that will accept dogs. Plus it also gives us the opportunity to help out a hiker that needs a ride. June 6th cannot get here soon enough! I am looking forward to trading my 1.5 hour commute to a 1.5+ mile walk in the woods every day!",,So many good things going on!,"May 26, Thu",0
Stripper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536833,"Tomorrow is the day our adventure begins! We will be driving out to Daleville, VA and begin actual hiking on Tuesday. I am so looking forward to getting back into the woods! Nigel and Kenny are so stoked and ready and it will be fun to see them as Kenny has never hiked before and Nigel only a few weeks. It's hard for me to believe I will be back on the AT in just a few more days!","So many good things going on!
