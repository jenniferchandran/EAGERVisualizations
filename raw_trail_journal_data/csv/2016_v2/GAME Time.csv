GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528623,"On Friday April 22nd (full moon) I fly to Atlanta and on the 23rd (my birthday) I start my AT journey. My cousin Colin will pick me up at the airport, I'll stay at his place, and then in the morning he'll drive me to the trailhead and even hike the beginning portion with me...great guy! My hike was planned for last year but I broke my ankle a month prior to leaving. I did follow Airlock and 3D's journals last year and I do want to thank 3D for his assistance in gear selection and helpful information.",,Count Down ,"Apr 18, Mon",0
GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528767,"For the last 5 years I've been hiking the high points of various states with my buddy from college and his son who's my godson. On April 19, 2013 we did the high point of Tennessee which is Clingmans Dome (highest point on the AT). Our hike was 8 miles on the AT heading north to south and we saw about 20 thru-hikers. Ever since then I knew that it was not just something that I wanted to do but had to do.",,Defining Moment,"Apr 19, Tue",0
GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528921,I hope to complete the trail in about four months which I know is pretty aggressive. My body and the trail will let me know after the first week or so if it's realistic. I gained quite a bit of weight after breaking my ankle so I'm looking at this as a 4 month weight loss program. I feel extremely fortunate to take on this endeavor. Being a self-employed architect I look at this as taking 4 months of retirement now and I'll work 4 months longer before actually retiring.,,Game On,"Apr 20, Wed",0
GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529464,"Day 1 was challenging and rewarding. I hiked the first 6 miles with my cousin Colin which was awesome. I'm surprised how crowded the trail and the shelter are. I'm settled in my tent now.
Last Sunday I asked my priest to pray for me. His reply was ""you should pray for us, you'll be closer to God"".
I saw a lot of cool wildlife...unusual flower, funky colored bird, and a huge beetle (the kind they eat on Survivor).","Springer Mountain

GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529633,Today was a lot of climbing and decending going over 2 mountains (great views). I was planning to stay at Blood Mountain Shelter but they've been having issues with bears so you have to have to a bear canister and bear spray (shoots 30 feet) to stay there. I hiked a couple more miles to Neel Gap and am now in a hostel. I showered and wash my clothes...living the life of luxury now as I post from my cot. The terrain doesn't look too bad tomorrow.,"Gooch Mountain Shelter 
",Neel Gap,"Apr 24, Sun",15.90
GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529821,"So staying in a shelter has its pros and cons. The pros are a shower, toilet, electricity, and not sleeping on the ground. The cons are stuffy room and trying not to wake others. I took a trail vitamin (Tylenol PM) and slept great but most likely to the detriment of the others in the shelter. The two people next me weren't there at 4:30AM. One was already up and the other was sleeping in the kitchen area. I probably won't stay in a shelter again just for the sake of others (an act of compassion towards others, what's happening to me?!!!)Today was a good day but long. I started hiking at 6AM. It was still dark for the first mile but it was spectacular...birds chirping and I got to see the sun rise. I met some great people including two guys from Malden, MA. Good group here at the shelter but they'll probably be up late. Time for the earplugs.

GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529968,"So today was a nero day (hiking a short distance, a zero day is not hiking at all) in order to resupply and give the body a rest. I even went to the post office to mail home 4 pounds of cooler weather clothes.Physically I feel pretty good but the bottom of my feet are pretty sore. I put some mole skin on a big blister on my right foot.I had a scare 3/4 of the way into my hike the first day when my left foot was screaming with pain. After a bit I loosened my laces and the pain subsided. There's definitely a learning curve out here.Southerners are much nicer people than northerners. Even on the trail, if it gets real steep they put in steps. Up north the attitude is ""suck it up weenie"".I plan to be on the trail early tomorrow if I can get a ride back to the trailhead.

GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530593,"Last night was fun. The 3 ""gray haired guys"" headed out to eat while most of the ""kids"" stayed back to carbo load (drink beer). We (Spark- retired electrician, Beach Bum- retired contactor & I) went to an all you can eat where I'm sure they lost money on us. I drank about a gallon of lemonade. The great ""kids"" included a brother (Trevor), and sister (can't remember her name so I'll call here Angel) and her friend (Fireman Allen). Angel was head-turning beautiful and sweet as pie so if you're dating her Allen you should put a ring on her...you'd make a great couple. Today was a long day. The answer to the photo question in the last post is about 1 in 50. Tim from Hiawassee, who was headed to see his mom after a surgery, picked me up after about an hour. I was on the trail at 7AM and finished about 6:30PM covering lots of peaks and gaps over the 21.3 miles. I encountered my first down pour which lasted an hour. It was more of nuisance than a hindrance but it did cool things off. I slept in a shelter for the first time (no tent since rain was forecasted) which had a cool design with a sleeping platform and two sleeping lofts.","Hiawassee, GA

Today was a good day and finished it with Moon and Chance (I call them the AT&T guys since they're the only ones that had cell service at the last shelter). They've known each other since kindergarten and take hiking trips together twice a year. This is their 2nd leg of the AT.

It mostly hurt going down and there was quite a bit of that. There's still an issue with my right foot so now I have pain on both sides. Most of the people out here are section hikers but I have met several thru-hikers: November, Trim, Lesley, Boots, Grizzly, Chris, and Prov. Lesley (girl from Utah who's learning Spanish using her headset) who I saw on the first day is the only other one I know that's doing similar miles to me.

GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531090,Today was tough. Both my foot and quad hurt a lot which slowed my pace down. It started pouring hard before I could get to the shelter so I took my glasses off. I was relieved when I saw a sign 1/4 mile to shelter but with my glasses off I misread the arrow and went a half mile in the wrong direction! When I finally got there it was a diverse group. I slept in the shelper so I wouldn't have to set up the tent in the rain.,"Rock Gap Shelter

GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531093,"This morning was a gift. As soon as it was starting to get light out I packed up and headed out before 7AM. It was cool and spitting rain but I was comfortable (ideal marathon weather for me). I felt awesome since my ailments were a lot more tolerable and I was able to hold a good steady pace since it was mostly decending.I ran into a nice guy from Maine, Laughs A Lot, who had thru-hiked a couple of years ago. He did it in 4 1/2 months and said he was able to do 25+ miles on hiking days in northern VA through VT. If you read my journal Laughs A Lot please send me the link to your youtube video.The afternoon was tougher and slower since there were a lot of roots and I'm very cautious about rolling an ankle.I had a mail pick at the Nantahala Outdoor Center but they said it didn't arrive.

It was a later start since I couldn't get my mail drop until 9AM. There were a few sections with unstable rocks and crossing one I wiped out and snap one of my poles. I now hike with two short poles which is okay for going up but tougher for coming down. I will be ordering new poles and have them shippedto me somewhere along the trail.As I got close to the top it started pouring, then lightning, then hail (Matt and Ben, similar to the top of Mt. Mitchell)! I picked up my pace until I got to the shelter around 7:45. The shelter was full and there were tents everywhere. I set up my tent in the pouring rain didn't sleep well since it was a pretty uneven location.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

He was doing the AT to complete the hiker's Triple Crown. He had already done the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail. We ended up sharing a room in town and he did a gear shake down (get rid of unnecessary items) for me which was awesome.Lesley is staying here also so I had dinner with her and Walk Moore who is a year older than me. I believe he's the only thru-hiker that I've met that's older than me.My quad is no longer an issue but both my feet were pretty sore at the end of the day so I may do a Nero day tomorrow to give them a rest.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Walk Moore, who's a doctor, gave me some castrol oil to on it and then I covered it with mole skin.This shelter is popular and crowded tonight since it's next to the dam, has a toilet and shower, and a water pump. Beach Bum is here who I haven't seen for several days so we got to share our experiences.I'm in my tent now and it's raining off and on. Tomorrow I'll be heading into Smoky Mountains where I've heard they might get some snow...never a dull moment.I'll be smart about making sure my foot is good...if you get a flat tire you got to fix it before driving on.","Fontana Dam, NC

There was a fair amount of climbing but the trail surface was pretty even so I moved along at a pretty good clip. I am surprised at how many people smoke. Although they do try to be respectful I've probably taken in more secondhand smoke in the last couple of weeks then I have in the last 10 years.
I'm at the overcrowded shelter now with a small piece of the platform at the foot of others. It's 34 degrees so I do hope my sleeping bag is good to 15.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Despite a lot of climbing the terrain wasn't too bad but the trail surface was a mess. With the rain and snow (about 3"" on Clingmans Dome) yesterday a lot of the trail was muddy, puddles, slush, and snow which made for slow progress. I believe the forecast is good for the next few days but I may take a zero day tomorrow to let the trail dry out a bit, but that will be a game day decision in the morning.

The beginning part of the trail was pretty sloppy but not nearly as bad as yesterday. I moved pretty quickly since I was slack packing (only carrying what I needed for the day) and would head back into Gatlinburg after the hike. When I finished Godspeed and Mountain Mama were in the parking lot offering sandwiches, chips, fruit and drinks along with a ride back to town. They are ""trail angels"". When their son was 18, he and Godspeed were thru-hiking the AT. At one point Godspeed got giardia and needed to leave the trail their son planned to continue but then decided he wanted to do this with his father. When the son got off the trail he had an issue with his sight and it was discovered that he had a stage 4 brain tumor and a 20% chance of survival. With surgeries and prayer he is now 30 and has 8 year old twins. The father and son finished their hike when he was healthy again.","Clingmans Dome

The weather was great and it was cooler since most of the hiking was at 5,000 to 6,000 feet elevation mostly along the ridge of the Smokies. The views were great, often in both directions since the trail at points was only 5 feet wide at the ridge. There was a good group at the shelter and I didn't tent in order to get an early start the next morning.","Newfound Gap

The first week out here there were some views most of the time in the lower sections since the leaves hadn't filled in but now the trees are pretty full (they call the AT the ""Green Tunnel""). There are still spectacular views at times along the ridge and at lower elevations.
Tom Ruffing (Matt's father) will pick me up in Hot Springs in two days which is 35 miles away, and I'll stay at his place in Weaverville . I'll resupply and pick up my new poles (I'm down to one since the one I broke the snapped one again).

GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532766,"I was expecting a good day but that didn't happen. The forecast for the next day showed thunderstorms in Hot Springs around noon. I was 13 miles from there so I left the shelter at 6:20. Within an hour of hiking it started thunder, lighting and a downpour. I was just coming off a ridge when lightning cracked just above trees near me...scared the crap out of me! When there's a downpour the trail literally becomes a stream which makes it difficult to negotiate. The rain eventually stopped and I was able to make good headway. There were 2 more downpours over the next few hours. When I got to Hot Springs I called Tom Ruffing and he picked me up. He's been awesome and it's really nice to be in a house. I'll take a zero day tomorrow to give my feet a rest, resupply and change out some gear at REI (lighter headlamp, pocket knife and water filtration system).All the people who are younger than me (which is everyone!) hike faster than me but I'm often the first to leave in the mornings and I hike longer days.I did my itinerary from my leather recliner drinking a Long Trail beer (for inspiration) assessing how far I could hike each day. It's a lot different to ""walk the walk"" given the terrain and weather, often with minimal sleep. The hike has been eventful and the people on and off the trail have been exceptional!","Walnut Mountain Shelter
","Hot Springs, NC","May 11, Wed",13.10
GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533053,"Tom Ruffing was awesome! The day was spent eating, soaking my feet, and shopping for supplies. We went to the Waffle House for breakfast, all-you-can-eat Chinese place for lunch, and to Tom's girlfriend Rita's house for dinner. Fun day and it felt great not putting my hiking shoes on. I also got to watch Survivor last night!
I truly appreciate your emails, texts, and posts in the guest book...it's like getting letters from loved ones on Survivor.
The best part of the day was when I spoke to my mom who has planning to have hip surgery for more than a year. She met with her doctor who said it was bursitis and they can treat it with cortisone. She is so psyched as am I.
The most disturbing part of the day was when I was watching the news and heard an AT hiker was bit by a bear at Spence Field Shelter. I had just stayed there a few days ago. Prayers to him.","Hot Springs, NC

GAME Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533162,"Today was the first time in a while that I wasn't limping for the first mile, so the blister is getting better. The first 8 or 10 miles were somewhat sad since there head been forest fires along the trail. I had heard they had to close the AT in that area recently due to fires. The weather was great but there weren't many views.
Yesterday I lightened my pack for the fourth time since starting. I even changed backpacks since I never liked the one I was using. I ordered a ULA Circuit last week and had it sent to Weaverville. It's more than 2 pounds lighter and much more comfortable. I also reduced weight with my headlamp, water filtration, pocket knife and camp shoes.
Hiking today the pack feels so much lighter and I'm carrying 5 days food (typically 2 pounds of food per day). Maybe eventually I'll be able to keep up with those wipper-snappers.","Hot Springs, NC

Good thing I have my new poles. I hope to get to Irwin, TN in two days with 19 miles tomorrow and 16 miles the next day.Physically I compare the hiking to caddying doubles for two to three 18 hole rounds for two horrendous golfers with big golf bags that play very fast on an extremely hilly course.","Little Laurel Shelter

I was planning to hitch hike back to the trail but you had to take the highway so I decided to wait for the 10AM shuttle. I had a second breakfast and got on the trail at 10:30. There was a lot of climbing and a good portion of the trail surface was rocks and roots (tough on my feet and ankles) but there were some magnificent views, my favorites at the grassy balds. For the first time we traversed a mountaintop the was covered with pine trees...dark and eerie.I used to get frustrated with the younger hikers flying past me and wished I had done this 30 years but I've realized I'm meant to be here now.

At least the fog kept it cool which allowed me to hike as far as I did.Yesterday ended really well dispite a short hike in the morning.

I would then assess the terrain and shelter locations to determine about how many days it might take. I always carried an extra day of food so the distance I covered each day was flexible.There were several boulder scrambles in the morning and it took me 5 hours to travel 8 miles.

The morning started with a steep climb and my body was achy and weak, a lot of effort getting to the top. Fortunately the next few miles were down to a road crossing. When I got there Hopper, who shuttles hikers to The Cabin Hostel, was there so I hopped in since all I wanted to do was sleep. Merlot was able to slack pack the next 10 miles then get a ride back to the hostel.The hostel was great. I napped, had some spaghetti and meat sauce in the afternoon, and that night they served steak and lobster...an amazing meal and a great group.

Staying at the hostel was doctor and he wrote a prescription for me. I'll pick up the prescription and rest today. He believes I'll be well enough to hike tomorrow after starting the 5 day dose.Unfortunately the drug store wouldn't accept the doctor's prescription since he was no in longer in practice.

We were then in the town of Caratunk where we stopped at Paul's B&B for a burger,  milkshake and to resupply.A few miles up trail I saw Gnome and knew it was not a good situation.  He was trying to wrap his leg. He said it felt like he was hit in the calf with a baseball. Thanks I called my PT, Jackie Shakar, and she assessed that he most likely had torn a muscle. He was able to slowly move forward keeping his foot flat and using his poles like crutches.  There was a shelter just up ahead and a road crossing so he was going to stop at the shelter and make an assessment in the morning after talking to his PT.  It killed me to leave him but he told me to move on. ","Pierce Pond Lean-to
