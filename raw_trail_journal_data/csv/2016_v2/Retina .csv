In 2013, I started my hike on April 22nd. On April 27th (which by the way is my birthday) I took a nasty fall and broke 2 ribs. I had hiked about 50 miles and was 10 miles or so from the Georgia - North Carolina border. I heard a crack when I fell so I was rather certain my ribs were broken. I took a few days off hoping I would feel better. Rather than go to the hospital I wanted to hike a few miles just to be sure I couldn't continue my little trip. I hiked another 50 or 60 miles and the pain was unbearable. Lessons learned: 1. Broken ribs hurt like hell2. It's hard to breath at times3. You can't lay flat on your back or your side 4. Most importantly you just can't carry a 32 pound pack and hike through the mountainsThe bottom line is I went to the hospital in Franklin North Carolina and the doctor told me I could stay in a hotel for 2 months or go home and enjoy the summer. So my first AT hike ended at 110 miles.",,View Entry,"Apr 01, Fri",0

I say if I go because right now I have a few nagging injuries that may stop me before I start. My knees are very sore. I've been running for 20 years and I think old father time has caught up with me. I can't even walk down a flight of stairs without pain in my right knee. Plus I fell on the ice about two months ago and hurt my shoulder. I should go to the doctor and get an x-ray but I'm afraid what he's going to say. Right about now you're probably thinking this guys an idiot and I'm not sure I can really argue with you. But if I don't hike this year I just don't see things improving next year. Each year you get a little older, lose more muscle mass so you're a little fatter and a little grayer. So basically it's now or never.",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Thu",0

When I hiked in 2013 I tried to keep my pack weight reasonable and I purchased a lightweight sleeping bag, pad and tent. These were all expensive items but well worth it because my pack only weighed about 32 pounds. I noticed many hikers were carrying at least 40 pounds. I don't know how they did it because 32 pounds was kicking my ass. The mountains in Georgia were not very forgiving, I guess that's why the Rangers have a training facility there. This year, I decided that I'm to weak to carry a 32 pound pack. So my goal is to get my pack weight down to 25 pounds. So the question now is how do I drop 25 percent of the pack weight? I started by spending $150.00 on a new pack. That's actually pretty cheap for a new pack. I saved about $50 by using a coupon (I love coupons). The pack is the same size and brand I used last time only it's 2 pounds lighter. Next I got rid of small stuff that was light but added up to a pound or so. Who really needs a compass. The last I checked the sun always rises in the east and sets in the west. And when you think about it the sun is never in the northern sky - the bottom line - no compass for me. I'll let you how that works out. The one thing that could be a huge mistake is I decided not to carry a tent. I'm obviously hoping to get into a shelter. That's one decision that could come back and bite me in the ass. I decided to fly into Roanoke, Virginia and hike to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia which is pretty close to Washington DC. That's about 310 miles and barring another little fall I should be able to do that in 30 days or so. The experts all recommend that when you start the trail you never hike further than 10 miles a day for 3 weeks. Once you get your trail legs you can do more miles if you wish. Using this theory I should get to DC in time for the 241st anniversary of our country on July 4th. Since I took off of work for 7 weeks that will give me a couple weeks to get home and relax a little.",,View Entry,"May 10, Tue",0
Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530367,"Well my hike is in one week and things aren't going very good. Last Saturday, I walked for 4 hours 30 minutes with my 28 pound pack (I won't be carrying that much weight) and did about 15 miles and things seemed very promising. The next day I walked 2 hours and pulled a groin muscle. It's been huring me since then even when I walk with the dogs for a mile or two. At this point I just can't see myself climbing mountains.
What do I do now? I really need to continue training with my pack but I can't risk a more serious injury. I suppose I'll just rest and try it again on Thursday and hope for the best. Either way I'm going to Virginia and let the chips fall where ever. In the meantime I think I'll try to cut more weight from my pack. I've got a couple of great ideas. You know the ideas that look good on paper or sound good when you say them in your head but are really very stupid ideas. 
I'll let you know what they are when I'm on the trail and we can evaluate them together. Next Sunday, May 29th is the big day.",,View Entry,"May 22, Sun",0
Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535525,"Today is Sunday May 29th, I took a quick shower and put on enough deodorant to last a while and we headed to the airport. I was worried about my pack so I decided to carry it on the plane with me.  All I had to do was get my hiking poles through the security check point.  I received my first random act of kindness from a TSA agent.  That's right a TSA agent.  The hiking poles were no problem but my 16 ounce jar of peanut butter was.  She initially said it was considered a liquid, then said you spread it so after she was going to toss it in the garbage.  Then I tried to look hungry and old her that was my food for the next two days on the Appalchain Trail and believe it or not she let me keep it.  So one on my goals for this trip is to pass on this act of kindness.  I left the Milwaukee airport at 5:40 am and arrived in Charlotte at 8:40. After a few hour layover I arrived in Roanoke, Virginia at 12:15.  Last week, I sent a message to the airport inquiring about ground transportation to the Appalchain Trail. They sent me the information on two options.  It's only 13 miles so it should be pretty cheap. The taxi company wanted $45.00 and I was afraid to call the limo service but surprisingly they only wanted $27.00  In 2013, I paid “Survivor Dave” $100.00 to take me from the Atlanta airport to the start of the Appalachian Trail (AT) on Springer Mountain.  My daughter Teresa was convinced that Survivor Dave was a serial killer.  I didn’t take her seriously at the time but I think she was actually worried about me.  It’s kind of funny when your kids are young you're their world, when their teenagers if you’re doing your job as a parent sometimes they hate you, by the time their 30 or so – they won’t admit it but NOW realize you were right during many of the arguments you had and when you’re my age the roles are reversed your children actually worry about you.  Before I left most of my kids asked me if I was sure I really wanted to go back to the AT. While they didn’t say it I think they were really worried about the old man.   As I mentioned in an earlier Journal entry, this year my goal is to cut the weight of my pack from 32 pounds (which I carried in 2013) to 25 pounds or less. I eliminated as much as I could and will carry only the minimum amount of food possible.  Food is the one variable in your pack that adds a lot of weight. That means that I will have to re-supply every day or two.  That wouldn’t be bad but I have to get off the trail and get into town. Most of the towns are 5 or 6 miles (and sometimes further from the trail) and if you’re in town you’re obviously not on the AT hiking.  So this may put a little crimp into making my mileage goal by the end of June.  Getting into town will definitely be a challenge.   Right now I’m carrying one day of food because I intend to resupply in Daleville which is about 20 miles away.  I ate in Charlotte but wasn't really hungry in Roanoke I just wanted to get to the trail. The limo dropped me off at the AT and I started my little journey about 1:30.  It will be interested to see if I can hike 10 miles today or if I’m going to behind the 8 ball on the very first day.  I only had to hike about 4 miles before reaching McAffe Knob which is one of most photographed locations on the AT.  I stopped and took a couple pictures which my daughter Tara will put in this Journal and on Facebook in the next few days. I could probably figure out how to do that myself but it’s much easier to simply send it to her.  I have my Iphone and tried to take my first selfie but I’m pretty sure it didn’t work.  Hey by the way,  I was very successful in cutting the weight of my pack.  After seeing the long range forecast called for 4 straight days of rain I decided to purchase a light weight bivy. A bivy is a small sack yor crawl into n and sleep.  It's basically looks like a body bag - so I cut a pound with the bivy and this will be easy to set up and take down.  Also after checking out the nighttime low temperatures for a few weeks I decided not to take a sleeping bag. The low temperatures are about 60 degrees and I’ll sleep on my little air mattress in pants and a long sleeve shirt. That saved another pound and a half.  Anyway carrying one day food my pack weighed 22 pounds. Since I’m not really in great shape this low weight should help me in the early days of my hike.  Each additional day of food will add about 1 to 1 ½ pounds to what I’m carry. I hiked 5 miles and arrived at the first shelter where I was told the next shelter was closed because of unusual bear activity. It was already about 4:30 so rather than hike another 11 miles I decided to stay put and be happy with 5 miles on the first day. I got a good spot in the shelter and that was great because it rained all night. I know this because I didn't sleep a wink. That happened on my first night on the trail three years ago. It was surprisingly cold and my no sleeping bag - cut all the weight out of your pack philosophy could turn out to be one of my dumber ideas (but there's plenty of those to go around). Basically even with long pants and shirt I froze my little tail off. That may have contributed to my first miserable night. I'll keep my rain jacket handy next time - this is my new dress in layers philosophy when you're an idiot and don't carry a sleeping bag on the AT. When the thru hikers found out I don't have a sleeping bag they just kinda smiled which told me what a foolish idea that was. Oh well it sounded good on paper so that's got to count for something.","Starting at Roanoke Virginia

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535780,"Memorial DayI didn't sleep at all last night so why not start hiking early.  I was on the trail by 7:00 am. My legs hurt everywhere.  One thing that worries me a little bit (besides the bears, cliffs, incessant rain and the serial killers) is that I really haven’t trained very much for this trip.  Last time, I climbed the mountains in Phoenix, ran the 203 steps in the Federal Courthouse for hours at a time and walked everywhere with my 32 pound pack.  Now I can't even handle a stinking 23 pound pack. This year this only thing I’ve done is walk with my black labs and think about how I can cut down on the weight I carry in my pack.  Ok I admit it I just procrastinated.  I couldn’t make up my mind if I really wanted to hike the AT or just stay home and babysit my grandkids.  Then about 6 weeks ago, I was watching Joe and Addy and for once they were pretty naughty and I made an irrational stupid decision and decided to hike the AT.  A few weeks ago, I started to get serious and train with my pack and everything was fine until last week when I hurt my hip and pulled a groin muscle.  So why not make it really hurt and go climb a few mountains. It was very slick on the trail today and I fell 4 times. Not to brag but these were all pretty good falls. What's the chances of breaking your ribs twice?  Right about now I'd say pretty good because they hurt quite a bit. It irritates the crap out of me because I purchased some good Merril hiking boots which I thought would take care of the falling down like a drunken idiot stuff.  But 5 good spills in two days has me worried.  Anyway because of the bears in the area I was forced to try and hike 15 1/2 miles to Daleville.   I knew this would be a hard day but didn't know how hard. The first half of the day was ok. I did about 10 miles in about 6 hours and just ran out of gas. The last 5 miles took me 4 hours and it was pretty much downhill. I think all of us older folks still think we're 25 years old. News flash - we're not. A few 30 year old hikers left the shelter about an hour or two after me and beat me to the hotel in Daleville by 2 hours. No offense but 2 of them were girls. I just had my ass kicked around the block by 2 women. But they've been hiking 700 miles and I've done 20. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. At one point I just fell down on the trail and took a 15 minute rest. I would have stayed there all night but I needed water really bad. When I got off the trail I was exhausted. I immediately went to a gas station and purchased 64 ounces of Gatorade and a 2 liter Diet Mountain. I drank about 100 ounces of cold liquids in about 15 minutes and didnt go to the bathroom for 4 hours. I have to stick to about 10 miles a day. I logged 42,000 steps on my Fitbit (and yes I took my Fitbit - but I may toss it over a cliff for all the good it's doing me) for 15.5 miles in the mountains. That would be about 30,000 on the streets of Milwaukee.","Campbell Shelter

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535857,"This is pathetic but I had to use a zero day (no hiking miles logged) already. My legs and ribs are hurting pretty good and I'm hoping they will feel better tomorrow. Otherwise I'll take some Aleve and head out tomorrow. Yesterday I hiked almost 10 hours. They say an average hiker uses 500 calories an hour so I expended about 5,000 and took in about 2,000. I had a free breakfast at the hotel; made a big waffle and a bunch of other stuff and basically ate enough for 2 (maybe 3 people) but I've got to bulk up a little. Dean's first ""Thought of the Day"". After losing a few pounds there's nothing wrong with stuffing your fat face. Side Note: this only applies to hiking the AT because most of us can afford to lose a few pounds and don't really need to stuff our fat faces at every meal. Once in a while it's ok but don't get in the habit.","Daleville

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536130,"The day started out very nice. I started the trail at about 7:45 am and like usual made good time for the first 3 or 4 hours. After that things always seem to slow down. I wonder if it's the same way at work - you know my production falls by 50% in the afternoon. I don't think so but I'm obviously a better hiker in the morning. As I crossed the trail near a highway I saw a nice big sign that listed the 10 Hiking Essentials for Safety, Survival and Basic Comfort. Well your probably not too surprised to hear that I'm missing 5 essential items. Who really need a compass - we discussed this in previous journal remember? Who needs to start a fire - the last I heard Smoky the Bear was against forest fires. The other missing items aren't even worth discussing. I left town with 5 days of food so my pack weighed about 28 pounds. I met a young woman who's hiking with her dog. She said when she started her pack weighed 58 pounds. She is so small I don't know how she did it. By this time the hikers who started in Georgia are doing 15 - 20 miles a day. I don't quite yet have my trail legs so I have to stick at the 10 mile mark for a few weeks. Today I plan to do about 11.5 to Wilson Creek Shelter. After hiking 9 miles in about 5 1/2 hours, I was getting water out of the creek. I slipped on a rock and I hit the ground hard. I landed face first on another rock and my mouth suddenly filled with blood. Yes I also landed on those tender left ribs again. I was going to ignore this little set back but my lip was split open pretty good. Most of the damage was on the inside but it just didn't seem like it would repair itself. Plus being on the AT probably would increase my chances of infection and the way my luck has being running you could rest assured that would happen. I needed to get some anti-biopics. There was another hiker there who actually knew how to use his iPhone. He figured we were about 5 miles from a road where if someone knew the area they could find us. I called Homer who helps hikers with rides but he was 3 hours away. He called his wife Teresa, who came and picked me up and drove me back to Daleville. Teresa is what hikers refer to as a trail angel. They do whatever they can to help other people. For instance sometimes they wait by the trail with a gril and cook food for the hikers or buy the soda etc. Teresa was there when I really needed someone and she drove me to the hospital. She refused any type of compensation. Her reply was you needed help and I'm glad I was there. So I received 7 stitches and a nice fat lip (and bruised ribs - I refused an X-ray - they hurt but Doctor Dean doesn't think they're broken.  Dean's Thought of the Day - As I was hiking the 5 miles to the road I was upset about falling again. I was so careful I just don't understand how it happened again. I thought of that old stupid saying ""when life gives you lemons - make lemonade"". Well I'm officially declaring that I hate that saying, So I'm changing it to ""When the shit hits the fan - there's always a mess. Unless you want shit on your hands don't even try and pick up the pieces"". That's much better and more realistic don't you think? So don't be talking about about that BS lemonade stuff anymore - remember it's shit hitting the fan. Now re-read these two sayings and think about about each one. Another thought of the day is from my son Kurt. When he found out about my fall he sent me a text. "" 6 or 8 stitches that not too bad. Your probably being a little baby about this. Quite whining you'll be fine"". He's always been the compassionate member of the Puschnig family. The point is that sometimes you have to be direct and honest with someone. That's exactly what I need to hear every once in the while.  According to my IPhone 14 miles in the mountains was 38,733 steps and 169 floors. That stupid Fitbit of mine broke so I threw it off the cliff today being careful not to fall myself of course.","Daleville

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536991,"Today is Thursday June 2nd, I woke up with a big headache. My lip is a little fat but it's ok. The doctor who stitched my lip said it was a good thing I came in because it wouldn't healed.  He also said I have to get the stitches out in 5 or 6 days.  This presents a problem because in this area of the trail I won't be by any towns at that time. So I decided to hitch a ride to Waynesboro and start again in the Shenodoah National Forest. My friend Richard lives in the area and I think he will help me if he's in town.
I caught a ride and started hiking about 11:00 am.  I was sluggish and just didn't have much motivation. It took me about 5 1/2 hours to do 8.1 miles. About an hour later there was a rain storm of Bibical proportions. The shelter filled up fast and we pretty much sat around waiting for the rain to stop.  A couple days before I left I took my grandson Joe to school on the bus.  He loves the bus which means I do as well.  He said ""grandpa momma says its going to rain this weekend. It rains because the flowers need drinking water. Yesterday I saw some flowers bending down"".  So according to a 4 year old rain is a good thing.  But Joe I'm here to tell you rain on the AT stinks and grandpa hates flowers.  Rain on the AT is miserable and it's supposed to rain the next three days. 
I found out that Teresa the trail angel that picked me yesterday thru hiked the trail in 2002 with her husband, 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son. They did about 2200 miles.  
Good news I didn't fall today.  But I walked slow and very deliberately.  I just can't take many more falls like I've had.  A lot of people passed me on the trail today all of the much younger and in much better shape. Plus this old man has a pace maker. More on that later. 
And now a political commercial from your prophet on the AT - also known as Dean's thought for the day: it looks like it's going to be Trump vs Clinton. What has this world come to.  We're all going to get in the voting area and vote for whoever we hate the least. Maybe everyone should head to the AT for a few years.  The only thing scarier is that one of those 2 will be running for reelection in 2020.","Wilson Creek Shelter

Theses hikers are doing 20 miles each day plus some. But they've hiked 900 miles from Georgia. I was exhausted when three Trail Angels arrived at the shelter with soda, beer, fruit and candy. That was amazing we're in the middle of no where and these 3 great human beings arrive with just what we needed. Plus they announced they were cooking lunch tomorrow at a camp ground 6 miles up the trail. An actual meal in the afternoon is just what I need to get me through the day. 
A little while later we spotted a big bear (300 pounds) near the shelter.  I tried to get a good picture and moved close to the bear but decided it really wasn't worth a picture and backed off a little.

This quickly turned out to be a disaster and  after I hiked 8 miles I ended up walking an extra 3 miles or so through the campground looking for the trail magic. It's a very long story and I won't bother you with the details because what's important is that I received a great lunch from my trail angels. One thing about the AT is there are many side trails. The shelters or huts are all on side trails. You (rather me) get pissed off after hiking all day to find the shelter is .3 miles down the trail from the AT. Many times it's down hill (to and from the shelter of course) and believe me it's always further than the sign post indicated. Then this extra mileage doesn't even count in your daily total.  I think this is bullshit and I started counting the extra mileage in my daily total.  Anyone who doesn't like it TS or like us Polish people say ""toughski - shitski"".What's more irritating is when you stop to rest and after resuming your hike realize you forgot your hiking poles or glasses and have to walk back a mile or so to get them.  You ask yourself if your $400.00 glasses are really worth the extra two miles. To prevent blisters I wear a liner sock and a thick wool sock and change socks midway through the day.  My socks were all soaked so I didn't do it today and now I have my first couple blisters.  When you're doing 35,000 or 40,000 steps and your feet hurt with each one it makes for a long day.  I did have more energy in the afternoon because I had chili dogs, soda, and ice cream. I have to find a way to eat more during the day.  This year I spent more time planning my menu and trying to figure out how much weight in food I was carrying but while it's better than last time it just hasn't worked out. People are eating all kinds of great food on the trail and I'm eating crap.  Right now I'm craving a hard salami sandwich.  I mean seriously if you can bring me hard salami sandwich I'll be your friend for life. Forget that if you can meet me on the AT with a soda we're connected for life. I'm somewhere on the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. I think about all kinds of crazy things during the day.  A few thoughts for your consideration: *Rule number 1:  There's nothing more important than your family.  I've    mentioned that to my kids 100's of times over the years.  After 30 + years I think they're finally starting to believe that.  More importantly I actually believe it.*Rule number 2:  Your dad is always right. The sooner you learn that and accept it as a fact of life the better off you will be.  The nice part about this is that sooner or later we're all dads. *Rule number 3:  If you're a parent remember sometimes you're wrong. Your kids will remember in 30 years and they're never bashful about pointing out your mistake from 20 years ago.","Blackrock Hut

I woke up about 6:00 am and had my usual 2 Pop Tarts and 32 ounces of water and hit the trail by about 7:00 am.
A ranger stayed at the shelter last night and warned everyone of pending storms the next day starting early in the afternoon. So I took a short 8.4 mile hike to the next shelter. My other option was another 12 miles so the decision was easy simply because I can't hike 20 miles on the AT just yet (probably never will).  There were gorgeous views and I saw a deer about 15 feet off the trail. 
I Arrived at the hut about noon and it didn't start raining until 5:00. My entire wardrobe is soaked and I stink like death warmed over. I was alone at the shelter until about 3:00 so it was rather boring. I ate a nice lunch and hung my food bag in case a bear wandered by.  I put up cloths line and tried to dry a few socks but there was no sun and it was humid as hell. I gave up after 4 hours.  Just a nice relaxing day on the AT.  
Dean's thought for the day: Sometimes doing nothing is nice. Relax and see where the day takes you. That may mean sitting on the couch in your pajamas and eating ice cream.

One young women had a minor panic attack when she realized in the morning she had crushed a mouse by rolling over on it.I got up very early and was hiking by 6:45.  My goal today is Lewis Campground; a nice hike of 12 miles.  Last night I spoke with a southbound hiker who stayed there last night. He's a school teacher from Georgia who said you can get a shower, do your laundry and rent a cabin for $40.  The teacher is hiking from Harpers Ferry to Roanoke, the exact opposite of my hike. It was a decent day.  I stopped on the trail and ate lunch which provided me with the energy I needed to get there by 2:00 or so.  I found out the cabins were $134.00 a night but he offered to give my one for $100.00. I was ready to take it when he said the woman in bunkhouse 15 sometimes lets hikers stay with her.  So I went down there to size her up - making sure she wasn't a serial killer. After a few minutes I asked if I could stay and she said sure - so I yogied my way to a free nights lodging.  Note:  on the AT if you can get something for free it's called yoging - after Yogi the Bear.  There's a good chance most of you are saying who the hell is Yogi the Bear.  Now there was a great cartoon. Anyway when I got in the shower I checked myself out in the mirror and I looked pretty rough not having shaved for 10 days.  I have a nice new scar on my lip and the start of a pretty good beard. Well ..... It is a little scraggly. I'll definitely have to cut it. I don't remember it being gray - where did that come from.  I'm keeping the mustache though - it's nice and thick.  On second thought people on the AT may mistake me for a 1980's porn star. It would be a hassle getting propositioned by all the women on the AT.  I'd have to carry condoms which would add weight to my pack. Well I'm keeping the mustache so maybe I'll carry a couple just in case.In case you haven't figured it out I have a strange sense of humor.

The woman, Fran McConnell who allowed me to stay was very nice and I certainly appreciate her generosity.  I left about 7:00 am and hiked the 9.6 miles to Big Meadow Campground in about 4 1/2 hours. The trail was fairly easy comped to other areas I've hiked so far. I met my friend Richard who is taking me to Luray to get my stitches out. I felt bad when he said it was about 2 hours from his house.  He brought me cold gaterode, fruit and personal hygiene items. I was glad I was able to shower and wash my clothing yesterday or I'm pretty sure our friendship would have ended then and there.  Richard was so gracious he even offered to take me back to his house to stay and then take me back to the AT the next day.  He had already did plenty so we decided after we finished my chores for the day I would spend the night in Luray. We could not find a clinic and were forced to go to the Emergency Room. It took all of about 10 minutes including registration time. I wonder how much that's going to cost.  Richard and I then went to lunch at an Irish Pub. I thought the least I could do was buy him lunch for spending the day helping me. But Richard insisted on paying for lunch.  When he comes to Wisconsin I owe him big time. After lunch we went to find a hotel.  We stopped at the Budget Inn but ithey wanted $75 and I wouldn't let my dogs stay there.  The Best Western was a few blocks away.  When I walked in there was another hiker at the counter.  The hotel clerk said I could have a room for $100. I told him I was a hiker and asked for any special rates. He said how about $75 and I told him I was a veteran and asked him if he could do better.  He pretended to look around on the computer and then said how about $64.  I looked at the other hiker and asked what his rate was and he said $75.  So I was satisfied I received a good rate and took the room. Another type of Yoging like I explained the other day. I just realized  I've been Yoging people my entire life. We then went to Walmart and I purchased plenty of food for the next few days on the trail. My pack is going to be heavy. I was going to take a zero day tomorrow in Luray but decided to get a ride back to the AT early tomorrow morning. Thought of the day: Food is the one variable In your pack that will have the biggest impact on your hike. Too much food will make you pack heavy which may ruin your trip, too little food can have the opposite effect and ruin your trip.  Your attitude is the  variable that has the biggest impact on your life.  If you have a good attitude you'll go far no matter what you do.  If you have a poor attitude you'll create many more problems for yourself.  Outside the West Allis Police Department is a statue of a Police Officer holding the hand of two young children. I love this statue because it shows exactly what cops do - help people. On the back is an inscription that says Attitude is everything - life is 10 percent what happens to you and 90 percent how you react to it.  The bottom line is you control your life.These journals are really sounding preachy. That's probably the last thought of the day. Sorry I got carried away. But on the other hand who doesn't want to hear an inspirational message. My favorite so far is the one about the fan.","Lewis Campground

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537621,I stayed at the Best Western Hotel in Luray Virginia. Even in a hotel I still didn't sleep very well but at least I had a shower in the morning. I also had the greatest pancakes for about $3.75.  I received a ride to the AT from Pittsburgh (trail name) who was thru hiker in 2007.  My pack was unbelievably heavy because of all the food I purchased in town.  I started hiking at 7:45 and after 15 minutes I was sure I was going to have to throw some food away. I even started planning what I was going to chuck.  Then miraculously I got used to the weight.  Thank God it was an easy trail to start.  It was a cold and windy day on the AT.  Trees were blowing over and falling on the trail. Some of the trees that fell were huge and made loud cracks as they hit the ground.  In some areas trees blocked the trail. As I was walking down the trail pretty much day dreaming 2 bears ran across the trail and suddenly stopped and stared at me.  They both were medium sized bears and when I heard rustling in the woods I knew it was mama bear.  I don't mind saying I was a little apprehensive as I quickly walked away. It all happened too fast to get a photo. About 1/4 mile up the road  was the biggest pile of shit I've ever seen. Trust me on this one I've got two black labs and consider myself an expert on piles of shit. So I was finally able to answer that age old question. Does a Bear shit in the woods?   About 8 miles into the day we crossed a road and there was a wayside.  I had a great lunch:  grilled cheese and cheesy fries. If I could eat like this on the trail all the time I'd be a great hiker. I was very hydrated and it was cool so I actually went to the bathroom several times. The last few hot days I drank 100 + ounces of water and never went once. Very relaxing and enjoyable day on the AT.My mileage total is about 118 in ten hiking days. I have officially smashed my mileage total from 2013. Good job Dean.,"Big Meadows to Luray

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537754,"Last night the Shelter and tenting areas were packed with about 30 hikers.  So as you probably guessed I had another crummy nights sleep. It was very cold. I wore two pairs of socks, long pants, long sleeve shirt and my rain jacket.  I was snuggled in my bivy and wished I brought my sleeping bag.  I looked in the Guidebook and decided I would spend the next few nights at the Front Royal Hostel. It's up the trail about 10.5 miles. a hostel is basically a hiker hotel, like a bunkhouse / dormitory with showers and laundry services. I should be able to get good sleep here.  What was appealing to me is I can slack pack for a couple days. Slack packing is when you leave your pack at the hostel and get dropped off on the trail and simply walk (southbound) back to the hostel.  Today about midway through my hike I met ""Old School"" who is a retired Navy Veteran. He was a mustang (someone who enters the service as an enlisted man and later becomes an officer).  He served 23 years and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander when President Clinton downsized the military and he was forced into retirement (guess who's not getting his vote in November). We had a lot in common and made some tentative plans to hike together in 2017.   I arrived at the hostel and had a nice relaxing afternoon.  They had ice cream for sale so I was forced to eat 1/2 gallon. I showered, washed my clothes and  made plans for my slack packing trip tomorrow. It looks like I have a choice between 12 and 18 miles.  With no pack I'll take the 18 mile hike. Note: when you're slack packing you have to carry your supplies for the day. So your pack weighs a few pounds.","Gravel Springs Hut

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537755,"Great night sleep at the Hiker Hostel. Mike the owner gave me a ride at 7:00 am and dropped me off on the trail 18 miles north.  I had a small pack with water, food and my water purification system.  The pack probably weighed about 6 pounds or so.  The light pack was great and at first it felt like I was moving like the wind. With the light pack I expected to hike about 3 miles an hour which would put me back at the hostel about 1:30 pm or so.  After a few hours I noticed I wasn't hiking quite that fast. On a relatively easy trail I usually hike about 2 miles an hour.  I kept running into northbound hikers that I was with the past two weeks and everyone was surprised to see me now heading southbound.  So I was talking to many different hikers during the day.  I saw all kinds of animals today: bears, defers and foxes. The last part of the hike was a 1,500 foot climb over about 3 miles. It was the end of the day and I was dragging a little.  My IPhone showed 46,700 steps, 198 floors climbed and 18.74 miles traveled. Even when your slack packing 18 miles is a long way. It took me about 9 hours to complete my hike which included about an hour rest during the day. Another great day on the AT. Thought of the day: more miles doesn't necessarily mean more fun.","Front Royal Hostel

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537756,The last two days at the Hiker Hostel have been great. I really don't mind the shelters but I just can't sleep. This has provided me a good chance to catch some zzzz's.  I hiked 10.1 miles of easy trails and was done by noon. I had a little problem with my eye this morning that's nothing worth mentioning unless it happens again. My concern is that it's my good eye. I returned to the hostel cleaned up and relaxed.  The last two days there have only been 2 other people here but today a Boy Scout group of 11 people showed up.  You know it's going to be a crummy day when a scout plugged the toilet (overflowing) and I had to fix it.  I was the only one around and I felt sorry for him. I didn't say anything to the leaders - our little secret.  Hopefully it will be a good night. I plan to be hiking at 6:30 in the morning. It's going to be hot so an early start is necessary.,"Trico Tower Trail

Retina ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538231,"This is my last journal entry. This morning I left the AT after hiking 5 miles because I experienced some eye problems. I basically ignored the problem yesterday and it went away. But when it happened again this morning I just couldn’t continue. When I close my eyes and you should see blackness, the last two mornings I saw a big hole and a bright light. The hole is about 20 percent of the area and it’s definitely from my left eye. I have a history of eye problems. Several years ago, the retina in my right eye fell off twice and the vision in that eye is now a whopping 20 - 200.After it happened again this morning I hiked another mile or so and weighed my options. As much as I wanted to continue I decided to come home because I just couldn't take a chance with my sight. If it was my crummy eye I may have simply continued. I guess I could have had it checked out in DC. But I have new health insurance that doesn't look kindly on out of network services. Plus I wanted my own doctor who is familiar with my background.I went to Dr. Raja, my retina specialist, and he said the gel in my left eye has separated from my vitreous. There are no tears in the retina at this time, but because I suffered a detached retina in my right eye a tear is likely to occur in the left eye as well. Diagnosis: No vigorous exercise. When I tried to justify the Appalachian Trail as light to moderate exercise, he said I wouldn’t go back to the AT if I were you. I trust Dr. Raja, I receive shots in my right eye every 6 weeks to maintain my sight in that eye. I went home and thought good and long about what he said, while he didn't technically tell me not to go, I guess his message was pretty clear. What was a little hard to swallow is that I had a ride back to the AT the very next day. My uncle from Connecticut is in town and leaving tomorrow. According to the Trail Guide the AT looks relatively easy in Connecticut. Pretty small mountains / climbs etc. It was tempting to just hike a few more days (maybe another 100 miles) if you know what I mean. But I just can't risk losing the sight in my good eye.I was actually doing pretty good: only about 30 miles from Harper’s Ferry (my goal), my pack felt light (at least not killing me) today, I was up to about 162 miles and my trail legs were coming any day now (sure they were).On the bright side of things: I had a fantastic time, made a few new friends, helped a few people, got a little exercise, have a great new excuse to use a few sick days at work, saw and experienced a lot of great new things, now I get to babysit my grand kids and can take full advantage of my new 75 inch TV in my basement.Plus I learned a few new things for next year: bring a sleeping bag, a lighter pack is not always better, eat better and drink more and more miles doesn’t always mean more fun. Thanks to each of you for your support and following my little adventure on the AT. Thought of the day: It’s ok to quit once in a while.","Ashby Gap
