Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/362415,"This entry marks my start section hiking the AT, more than 11 years ago. It appears as a story I wrote for the newspaper where I worked, the Worcester Telegram & Gazette.
********Dick Hibbard and I had been trudging up the Appalachian Trail for more than two hours, struggling toward Mt. Greylock under the weight of overstuffed backpacks.Periodically, I would look back and offer assurance that the trail would soon level off and the effort would ease.Dick wasn't buying it.""If you were Pinocchio, we'd have enough firewood for the whole trip,"" he shot back.I had roped my good friend into this backpacking excursion to mark my 50th birthday. We planned to cover the trail from North Adams south to Tyringham in seven days.The trip offered an adventure I had been seeking since hitting my middle 40s. Passing on the more traditional male dalliances of middle age, such as chasing women half my age, getting a sports car or wearing a thick gold chain under an unbottoned shirt, I decided to meet my midlife crisis head-on through a physical challenge in the outdoors.The North Adams-to-Tyringham trek devolved from loftier, more dangerous, more expensive and unrealistic considerations. These including climbing Mount McKinley or Mount Rainier; or hiking the northernmost 100 miles of the 2,150-mile Appalachian Trail, a stretch totally in the wilderness.Our route through the Berkshires would go through a town or cross a paved road every day, leaving us plenty of wiggle room for a mistake.Which was a good thing, given that we were rookies in this backpacking game. And old rookies at that. At 57, Dick wondered why I didn't have this brainstorm for his 50th birthday.Our big mistake was a classic novice blunder: taking too much stuff, especially food. We each packed enough to feed two people for a week.And Dick, not wanting to subsist on raisins and nuts, brought along fare not often seen along the trail, judging from the reaction of other hikers. He hauled a dozen eggs, a pound of bacon, two pounds of candy, ham steaks, chicken breasts and a package of hot dogs, among other things.On top of that, he had a small saw, two tarps, a fishing pole, night crawlers and mealworms, even a small American flag to wave when we ""summited"" Greylock.I knew we were in trouble when he called the day before our trip to say we might be delayed while U-Haul rigged a trailer hitch to his pack.How heavy was it? Well, it tipped the scale in Dick's East Brookfield sporting goods store at 60 pounds. And that was without the food.Hikers on the AT often adopt trail names, which they use to introduce themselves and enter in registers along the way.Because of my bent posture under my own hefty pack, Dick dubbed me Quasi -- short for Quasimodo -- and he adopted Efram. But as the days wore on, we morphed into the Dick and Dave Show, entertaining our lighter traveling brethren from campsite to campsite.One woman was so astounded to see a saw that she took Dick's picture with it. The fishing pole and live bait also proved big hits with trail veterans.But no one could deny that we ate well. While others nibbled on their rehydrated meals from foil pouches, Dick laid out hors d'oeuvres of slice pepperoni, cheddar cheese and Wheat Thins. Then the culinary school graduate went to work over my tiny, white gas stove, whipping up a tuna sauce to top off the pasta left over from the previous night.Though most hikers took good-natured jabs at us, one woman said it was refreshing that we weren't gear geeks, the kind of hikers so obsessed with shaving weight that they drill holes in their toothbrush handles. We were more like a traveling convenience store -- with a good hardware department.Dick put many of those backbreaking extras to use, however. At the Crystal Mountain campsite, for example, he fashioned a shelter with one of the tarps, giving us a place to get out of the rain without settling into the tent. And when he stepped on his glasses, he naturally had soft wire and duct tape for the repair.Still, hauling all that gear and food came at a heavy price. We worked much harder than hikers carrying 30 or 40 pounds. And at the end of the seven days, we had only covered 43.5 miles of the 50-mile route.But that's OK. Since Dick owes me 6.5 miles, we'll just have to get out there again.If our just-completed trek is any guide, we'd have a lot to look forward to.Here is how events unfolded, day by day, on our trip.Day 1After I get us lost for several hundred yards, we find the trail and climb for four hours, plopping down on a clearing at the junction with the Mount Prospect Trail. The sweeping view of Williamstown below almost makes us forget the climb. Almost.At the Wilbur Clearing lean-to, we run into Mohawk Joe, a guy with a haircut to match his trail name, who says he is on his way to a construction job down in Florida. He drinks water from a nearby stream without filtering or treating it, and makes supper using wild mushrooms. We wish his digestive system well.We throw a rope over a 3-inch-thick branch so we can hoist our food bags out of the reach of bears and other poachers. The branch cracks under the bags' weight, but holds through the rainy, windy night.My $49 Coleman tent, with duct tape patching a hole in the rear wall, keeps us dry.Day 2We take our time breaking camp, then plod up to Mount Greylock in the cold, wind, drizzle and fog. Three teens on a day hike decline my joking offer to become porters on our expedition.At the summit the fog is so thick that when the doors of Bascom Lodge are opened, it blows in like snow in a blizzard.Dying for a cola, Dick finds a soda machine and wonders what letter-number combination to punch in. ""With my luck, it will probably start playing 'Blue Suede Shoes,'"" he says.Tired and fearing we might not find our next campsite in the fog and fading light, we relent and spend the night at the lodge. We are served salad, biscuits, chicken stew, mushroom-stuffed chicken, wild rice, acorn squash and bread pudding for dinner, and Cheerios, scrambled eggs, sausage, toast, bagels and coffee for breakfast. And we didn't have to carry any of it.Day 3The day dawns clear and cold, and sunshine lifts our spirits, if not the load on our backs. From the summit, we see the vistas that were obscured by fog the previous day. We make good time, heading to Cheshire and a cold beer. On the way, we skirt what the Appalachian Mountain Club's trail guide calls ""a precipitous drop"" into Kitchen Brook Valley, as well as bear scat on the trail.We descend from the mountains into fields and across a farm where, delicately, we climb wooden steps built to pass over the barbed wire fence of a cow pasture. A misstep here and ... It's too painful to think about.At a bait shop near the Hoosic River, a guy named Ken allows us to leave our packs, gives us directions to the package store and lets us crack a beer at his picnic table when we return. Walking without packs feels like walking on the moon, with its light gravitational pull. And beer never tasted so good.At a makeshift camp just outside of town, Dick burns his socks while trying to dry them by the fire.Day 4We start the day with ham and cheese omelets, which Dick cooks in individual pie tins before the stove conks out. I suspect dirty fuel that we transferred from his stove, which had sprung a leak on Day 1. It rains all day. We pause at an outcropping called The Cobbles and look back down on Cheshire, then pass a beaver pond ringed with red foliage. Fresh tracks in the muddy trail give us hope that we might see a moose, but we don't.The Crystal Mountain campsite has no shelter and is one gloomy place after six hours of rain. Dick rigs the tarp shelter and somehow starts a fire, using a fire-starter pack, birch bark and soaking wet wood.From there, things improve. The rain lets up, and the stove sputters and spits enough heat to cook noodles and mushroom sauce.While we write in our journals by firelight, a fallen tree, caught in the crotch of another, sounds hauntingly like a mooing cow when the wind blows. By morning, a shift in wind direction and speed has the tree playing violin sounds.Day 5We hike roughly five miles to Dalton, where I call my son to say we won't make it to Tyringham, so pick us up on Route 20 in Lee instead. A hardware store worker fills my fuel bottle with fresh white gas -- for free -- and we make our way to Kay Wood Shelter.Rick arrives from the south at the same time. He is from Florida, and is on a month-long hike.He tells a backpacker joke that goes something like this:A customer arrives at the cannibal restaurant and checks the menu. Boiled accountant, $6.95. Roasted lawyer, $6.95. Sauteed salesman, $6.95. Baked backpacker, $16.96. The customer asks the waiter why the backpacker is so expensive. ""You know how hard it is to clean a backpacker?"" the waiter answers.With clean fuel, my stove is firing like a blowtorch. We sleep in the shelter's loft. Life is good.Day 6With the vegetation trampled near apple trees and blackberry bushes, we know we're in bear country as we hike up Warner Hill.Then we spot a cub scurrying away through the ferns. Excitement quickly turns to concern. Where is the mother? Dick has a whistle, of course, and I clap my hands to alert her to our presence. We don't see her, which is fine with us.After nine miles of hiking, we arrive at the October Mountain lean-to. Eight people -- five men and three women -- will stay at the site.Betsy, a fireplug from Florida who reminded me of Rosie O'Donnell, arrives with a flourish. Pointing to the welcome sight of wood piled high for the night's campfire, she said, ""I just want you guys to know that size does matter."" Minutes later, her friend, Leslie, trudges in, looking tired and cold. Despite mild complaints about her circumstances, Leslie warms to the occasion and tells two of the better off-color jokes at night as everyone stands around the fire.For fear of mice scurrying around the shelter or men snoring, the women stay in tents, while the guys sleep in the shelter's bunks or loft. ""Chivalry is not dead,"" Dick cracks as he crawls into his sleeping bag. ""The women are sleeping outside.""The overnight temperature dips to 19 degrees.Day 7We hoof it out to Route 20 in Lee, stopping first at beautiful Finerty Pond for lunch. My son is supposed to meet us, but the pickup place -- a restaurant -- is closed, and so is the alternate spot nearby. With more than two hours to kill, we accept a ride from fellow hikers to a convenience store 5 miles west. I figure we can't miss my son on his way to the rendezvous point.Sitting in the sun in the store's parking lot, Dick and I toast with 22-ounce beers and reminisce about the trip. The hours pass, and we realize there is either a snag in the plans or we have missed my son.I bum a ride from a customer who is willing to transport a stranger who hasn't showered in five days. He stops first at his house to drop off groceries, then emerges with a beer for him and one for me. We find my son, a doctoral student at MIT, studying in the parking lot at one of the pickup points.Dick and I burn his ear about the trip all the way home.","North Adams, MA

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/362541,"I've lost my notes for this second AT section hike, so I'm reconstructing this more than 10 years later, from shaky memory.*****************Day 1Dick and I weren't exactly big mileage guys, given that on our first trip we covered only 43.5 miles in 7 days. But on our first day on this leg, we hike more than 11 miles to the Shaker Campsite.There are two other hikers there, and we have one of the biggest campfires I can recall on the trail. I stay up late to make sure we don't burn down the woods.Day 2We hike to the Mt. Wilcox South Lean-to, set up a tent at the site, hang the bear bag and start happy hour with hard booze, pepperoni slices, cheddar cheese and goldfish crackers. Life is good ... ... Until we spot a line of kids snaking their way through the woods down below. It's still early in the day, and we're hoping they're going farther north, perhaps to Mt. Wilcox North Lean-to.No such luck. About 10 kids and two men march into the campsite, and one of the kids announces they are a Scout troop from Lee and they're spending the night. It doesn't take Dick and I long to decide to pack up and head south, stealth camping somewhere near Benedict Pond.Day 3It's an easy 4-mile hike to Tom Leonard Shelter, where we set up the tent on a platform with a sweeping view to the south. Dick likes the site so much he later outfits his wife with backpacking gear and returns with her.Day 4The descent from East Mountain is steep and slippery, and our feet are killing us when get to the bottom. Again we stealth camp, not far from a residential neighborhood.Day 5We hike to the end of our section at Jug End Road, and are surprised that it's so remote. We wonder if Phyl will be able to find us out here.Two turkey hunters from the Cape are taking a break where they've parked their pickup. After some good natured banter with them, we accept their offer to drive us to South Egremont, where we hope to have a couple beers and intercept Phyl on her way to Jug End Road.It's a wild ride to get there. Dick and I, our packs and a 20-lb. turkey one of the guys had shot bounce around wildly in the back of the pickup as it speeds down the dirt road toward town.Happy to get there alive, we thank them, find a package store and crack a beer beside a stream nearby. And here, right in the middle of town, we see a deer grazing on the other side, the only deer we've seen in two trips on the AT.Dick can't reach Phyl, and we fear she's gotten by us and might be waiting in the wilds of Jug End Road, a discomforting thought given the hunters we encountered plan to return there. So he stays put while I hitchhike back to where the trail crosses the road. And who's there but the two hunters.As I wait with them, I get increasingly uncomfortable. They're rough around the edges, talk tough and, obviously, have guns. At one point, a car comes down the road, and one of them briefly gets in front of it, yelling at the driver to slow down. This makes me really nervous.But after a half hour, Phyl and Dick arrive. They had connected in South Egremont. I'm glad to see them, and to leave the crazed turkey hunters behind.","Route 20, Lee, MA

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/362503,"Day 1My father drops us off on Jug End Road, a well packed dirt road south of South Egremont.We find the uphill start difficult, given that Dick has been up since 12:30, too excited to sleep, and I had to work until after 2 a.m.Climbing Mt Everett, at 2,600 feet the highest point on this hike, we meet a guy headed north from North Carolina. He's whipped from the climb, which is much tougher coming from the south.Race Mountain proves the prettiest place we've seen in three trips, a long stretch along a dicey ridge with great views of the valley to the east and mountains in all other directions.We camp at Bear Rock Falls Campsite, near a cliff in a hemlock grove, which has three tent platforms. After eating MREs we bought at Ocean State Job Lot (not bad but very heavy), we turn in. I have my best sleep in weeks, winning the snoring contest with Dick, which is no small task, given that he is a world-class snorer.Day 2We awake to a beautiful sunrise that splashes a red blotch of light on the tent wall, and we're off after a breakfast of oatmeal, bacon and cheese sandwiches and coffee.We descend into Sages Ravine, a beautiful spot with boulders, pools and hemlocks. (I like it so much I later return on a solo backpacking trip.Atop Bear Mountain, the highest point on the trail in Connecticut, we meet a woman hiking with her Newfoundland and Jack Russell terrier. While eating lunch on Lion's Head, a thunderstorm rolls and crashes to our east.We get rained on en route to Plateau Campsite, and while Dick sets up the Tyvek tarp as supplemental shelter to the tent, I hoof it into Salisbury to buy beer. What a treat to have beer in the middle of a backpacking trip.We're awakened about 9:45 by four young, inconsiderate dipsticks who talk loudly and laugh while making camp. After that I sleep poorly, sliding toward the front of the tent on the pitched terrain and hearing the rain pounding the Tyvek during the night. Adding insult to injury, I miss my pee bag in the dark, wetting both my pants and my sleeping bag. Nice. Dick does not let me forget this.Day 3Because we had no water -- we made a point to buy beer but not water! -- we break camp without breakfast or coffee and have little in the tank for the climb up Barrack Mattif.Finally, we find a pool of water deep enough to filter (a puddle on the trail, really), and after oatmeal and coffee we resume hiking with energy.After taking in vistas at Billy's View and Rand's View, we stop at an old logging area, sit in Adirondack chairs and relax in the sun. Later, rather than taking a chance on whether water will be available, we filter some funky looking stuff from a culvert in front of Housatonic Regional High School and head up to Belter's Campsite.The site, in the hemlocks, is quite nice, but it's within earshot of a race track, which makes for a noisy evening, at least early on. Also taking away from the wilderness experience is a 1960 Ford Galaxy 500 that has been abandoned in the nearby woods. Dick pisses his sleeping bag while attempting to go in his pee bag while lying on his back. We're even.Day 4After some climbing, we reach Hang Glider's View, a steep drop off with a 20- to 25-foot launch ramp. It's cold and windy, and we don't linger.On the descent from a hill atop Housatonic State Forest, we drop through an amazing cleft boulder, just wide enough to get our packs through, and walk two miles down West Cornwall Road to meet Dick's wife, Phyl. She brings us food and beer, we picnic by the covered Cornwall Bridge. We don't have the heart to tell Phyl that contrary to what she thinks, we haven't gone without beer for four days.","Jug Eng Road, MA

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/362604,"Before our weeklong spring section hike, Dick and I decide to scout the pickup point to avoid having his wife trying to find us on a dirt road, perhaps running into crazed turkey hunters, like Jug End. We want to be able to tell her exactly what to expect, and make other arrangements if need be.During lunch near Cornwall Bridge, we look at the map, and I note that the campsite where we'll stay on Day 2 of our upcoming trip, at Mt. Algo, is a short walk from the town of Kent. ""I can hike there for beer,"" I say to Dick, with some excitement.""I think we can do better than that,"" he answers.Then he lays out a plan to stash beer in the stream at Mt. Algo, just a short distance from Route 341. So, we find a package store, park on Route 341, hike to the campsite and stash a king six-pack under rocks in the stream.
We stash another six-pack in Duell Hollow Brook, just past the pickup point on Hoyt Road in New York.
Scouting pickup points and stashing beer thus become standard operating procedure for our next few hikes, as you'll see.","

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/362634,"Day 1After hiking 9 miles, we set up camp at Stewart Hollow, and Dick heats our MREs on his new stove, a Sierra that burns small pieces of wood.The site is just beautiful, sitting between Stewart Hollow Brook and the Housatonic River.Just when we finish dinner, I hear something strange and joke to Dick, ""Is it just me, or is there a train coming?"" But this is no joke. A microburst is upon us, and there is no time to run to the shelter, which is just a short distance from the tent.Fortunately for us, the burst doesn't touch down till it reaches the other side of the river, where we hear trees snapping. We know we were very lucky.About midnight, we hear female voices, belonging to two young women from New York who set up camp next to us. (The next day, we get a kick out of their food bag, hung on a bush about 16 inches off the ground. They must have thought a small state like Connecticut has small bears.)Day 2We break camp after a delicious breakfast of bacon and cheddar cheese on pita bread, and start hiking on a delightfully flat stretch of the trail along the river.Encountering a group of birders, we tell them we'll be the wildest birds they see that day.The climb up St. John's Ledges, over a jumble of boulders, is steep, but the view from the top is gorgeous.We meet two northbound thru hikers, with their dogs, who started in February. Even though I appreciate the opportunity to be on the trail for a week each spring and fall, I envy the thru hikers we meet who will be out here for five or six months. Ah, but life gets in the way.We arrive at the Mt. Algo campsite, eagerly anticipating drinking the beer we had stashed in the nearby stream a month ago. But a half-hour passes, and we can't find it. The water level in the stream is down from our last visit, and vegetation has sprouted long the banks. The place just doesn't look the same.I give up on the beer and start setting up camp, leaving Dick to search the stream like a bear pawing for salmon. Then I hear my friend yell triumphantly and see him holding the six-pack aloft, covered in mud. One can has a pinhole puncture, and being fanatics about pathogens in the water, we decide not to drink it. But after splitting the other five beers, we throw caution to the wind and drink the punctured can, too, with no ill effects.Day 3It's a shame to see how fire has blackened Schagticoke Mountain, but as we hike through the fire zone it is encouraging to see efforts made to shore up the trail against erosion and two colorful birds, a Baltimore oriole and a scarlet tanager. They and a fox spotted on Day 1 make up the wildlife we'll see on this trip.Ten Mile River campsite is a beautiful, open spot along the Housatonic, and we eat the last of our snacks and drink the last of the hard booze we carry in flasks, toasting our final night on this trip.In my notebook, I write that it's been another magical trip.Day 4After climbing Ten Mile Hill, we coast past Hoyt Road, the pickup point, to Duell Hollow Brook, where we plan to clean up and drink beer we stashed there.En route, we say hello to a couple thru hiking, and get rained on but pass on the rain gear because it's warm and we're nearing the end of our hike.From the bridge at the brook, we walk upstream a ways, planning to clean up a discreet distance from the trail. But when hikers pass nearby, we realize we've been standing buck naked just feet from the trail, which parallels the stream at that point.This time, the beer is easy to find, and Dick and I knock off the six-pack before Phyl's arrival to pick us up.","West Cornwall Road, CT

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/362861,"Day 1We ride to the start with Dick's son, Dickie, and wife, Phyl, in Dickie's VW bus. The old bus has trouble keeping up speed on the hills of Vermont, so we hit the trail 2 1/2 hours late.About a half mile from the trailhead, we pick up a very nice looking, 20-something blonde who is hiking the Long Trail by herself, heading north. Dickie is smitten, and thinks he might like to take up backpacking.We get going on our 5 1/2 mile first day hike, taking in the incredible vista from Baker Peak, with the Green Mountains poking through the clouds and Route 7 winding through the valley below. These are much bigger mountains than we've experienced in Massachusetts or Connecticut.We had hoped to camp at Peru Peak Shelter, but there are 8 to 10 people there, a group of college kids on an outing. They offer to make room, but we decide to head south for a bit and stealth camp, after purifying water.It never ceases to amaze me how few good spots there are to camp in the mountains. The trees and underbrush are often so thick or the terrain so steep you can hike for miles without seeing a suitable spot to pitch a tent. But we find one, make camp, break out the hors d'ouevres and booze and have happy hour.Usually we hang the bear bag before indulging, and today proves why. We have difficulty throwing the line over a branch in the dark, and have a hard time hoisting our full food bags out of the reach of critters.Day 2Speaking of critters, we get the scare of our lives just before dawn.We hear something big coming our way in the dark, crashing through the brush. Quickly sitting up, I say, ""What the fuck is that?"" Then, when whatever it is seems right on top of us, we yell as loud as we can, almost as if on cue. In a moment, we hear it in the distance.My heart is beating out of my chest, and we don't budge for a minute or two. Then Dick says, ""Well, God hates a coward,"" zips open the tent and has look around with his headlamp. He sees nothing, and we lie back down until daylight, unable to sleep.Dick had speculated it might have been a moose, and when it's light he finds tracks that come to a skidding halt no more than 15 feet from our tent -- headed right for us. The big fella must have hit the brakes and turned around when we screamed.In all my years of hiking since then, I've never experienced an encounter like that. And, frankly, I hope I never do again. But it makes for a great story.From Spruce Peak to Styles Peak, we feel swallowed by the woods, unable to see 10 feet into the brush on either side of the trail.Shortly after picking up a king six-pack we had stashed in a stream at Routes 30 and 11, we meet a thru hiker and are relieved he's heading into town for a shower and a shave. Selfishly, we don't want to share our beer. And who could blames us? We made a special trip to plant it.The thru hiker is the first person I've seen with Crocs, which he says are incredibly light and perfectly suited for stream crossings and wearing in camp. We had been packing Tevas, and when I finally find Crocs at an outfitter in Kittery, at least a year later, I eagerly buy them for Dick and I. I've taken them on backpacking trips ever since.We camp just south of Route 11, and during happy hour, a rescue dog runs by, with his trainer in hot pursuit, saying he has something hidden in the woods for the dog to find.Three 16-ounce beers give me a headache, which gets worse at night, but I sleep pretty well.Day 3I awake with a wicked headache, and we stay in the tent until light rain lets up. When Tylenol fails to relieve my headache, Dick gives me two ""Pain Away"" tablets, containing caffeine, ibuprofen and aspirin, which do the trick by lunchtime.On the day's hike, we take the advice of a hand-written sign that says, ""Don't miss the view of Manchester behind you."" A short side trail leads to an outcropping with a sheer drop-off, offering a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains and the town in the distance.We make camp just beyond Stratton Pond.Day 4Climbing up Stratton Mountain, I say to Dick, ""Here comes a hiker down the bunny trail."" But that dark shape is no hiker. It's a moose, which turns off trail, giving us a brief, but perfect view of it from the side.Atop Stratton, it smells like Christmas because of all the spruce trees. The wind is gusting, which makes for a scary climb up the fire tower. Haze obscures the view. On the way down the mountain, we pause for lunch and for Dick to tend to his habitually sore feet.We camp on an abandoned road just south of Black Brook.Day 5At Stony Brook Shelter, carved in a supporting beam, is food for thought: ""Seize the day, hurt tomorrow."" I like that.We pass a big beaver swamp full of dead, bleached out trees and surrounded by splashes on the live trees. Each day the foliage gets more colorful.I never get to take Dick up on his offer to kiss my ass if we get to Caughnawaga Shelter by 3 p.m., even though we arrive an hour early. The shelter, built in 1931, is a shit hole, so we decide to move to Kid Gore Shelter, a mere tenth of a mile away.Kid Gore is 40 years newer, bigger and offers a sweeping view of the mountains to the southeast. Happy hour begins before 3, after we claim the top bunks and spread out gear to dry in the sun and wind.Not long after, one of the true characters we've met on the trail emerges from the woods. He's a Belgian who says he teaches French in Montreal and is camping near the other shelter, nursing a sore shoulder. Dick dubs the bearded, soft-spoken man The Monsignor, and gives him a tin pie plate which he plans to use for pancakes.We also meet a former Israeli soldier, who's out hiking for a month to see the foliage.Despite being comfortable in the top bunks of the shelter, I don't sleep well.Day 6It rained a couple times during the night and, after another visit from the Monsignor, who eerily emerged from the thick fog, we hike to the summit of Glastonbury Mountain. I climb a rickety fire tower where, of course, there is no view.After lunch at Goddard Shelter, we trek to Porcupine Lookout on a ridge with nice views of the foliage, distant mountains and four windmills. There's a campsite and a fire ring there, even though it's right on a bend in the trail.I have mixed emotions about this being the last night on the trail, and envy hikers who pass on their way to Canada via the Long Trail.Our campsite is exposed, and wind whips the tent fabric during a rainy night. I get up about 1 to pee, and it's like standing in a cloud.Day 7We awake to a windy, misty, miserable morning, so raw it freezes my hands, and decide to hike to Melville Nauheim Shelter for breakfast and to wait for Phyl. The shelter is just a mile and a half from Route 9, the pickup point.Coffee never tasted better.While we kill time and try to stay warm, a 22-year-old kids arrives. His trail name is Dark Mike, and he looks it, with 10 piercings in his face. He says he's on his way to Georgia, and while he has some good equipment (Gregory pack, MSR stove and North Face bag), he's wearing cotton socks, an unlined windbreaker, a cotton sweatshirt and unlined nylon pants. He eats lots of rice, he tells us.Dark Mike tells us he's been homeless and stole his tarp from another shelter, where it had apparently been left by a trail angel. It's a long 3 1/2 hours before we leave. We don't trust Dark Mike enough to sleep. But he seems like a kid at the crossroads, and I think that hiking the AT is a good thing for him to be doing at this point in his life.","Danby, VT

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363252,"Day 1This is the first of two trips Dick and I will take with our sons, Dickie and Nate, both in their late 20s.We leave my van at the Greylock Community Club in North Adams and ride with Phyl to the trailhead at Route 9 in Bennington. As we shoulder our packs, Dickie looks up the steep, half-mile long Harmon Hill and says, ""We're not going up there, are we?""Yes, we are, and it's a tough, wet slog to the top. We pause for photos, and Nate later Photo Shops one of the two of us, adding a rearing, roaring grizzly to the background. I still have that photo in my family room.We arrive at the Congdon Shelter at 12:30, and while Dick whips up a pot of minestrone soup, the boys play darts, with their target drawn in charcoal on a tree near the shelter. The day is spent eating and drinking. Because Nate's pack was so light, Dick had him carry a disposable aluminum barbecue grill, complete with charcoal soaked in fluid and a grate, on which we cook teriyaki chicken and beef on sticks.Adam, a guy about our sons' age who's just finishing the Long Trail, arrives just in time to get in on the treat. A light packer, he appreciates this little luxury.After the usual happy hour, with pepperoni, fish crackers and cheese, we heat up MREs, eat and hit the shelter's bunks early. Adam stays by the fire, saying he's expecting his girlfriend, who will join him to end his hike.Sure enough, about a half hour later, she arrives after hiking in on a side trail, by herself, in the dark. She even brings Adam a big bottle of Canadian microbrew. Now she's a keeper, I say to my bunk mates. Inconsiderately, they keep us awake by talking for the next hour. I share a bunk with Nate, who elbows me or slaps the bottom of Dick's bunk when our snoring gets to him.About 10 p.m., a lone hiker opens the Tyvek that Dick had hung over the front of the shelter and finds himself a place to sleep on the floor. He's gone before we get up in the morning.Day 2After breakfast of oatmeal, bacon and cheddar on pita and coffee, we hike south in raw, threatening conditions. There are not any views; either we're deep in the woods or clouds and fog obscure the vistas. As we slosh along toward Seth Warner shelter, a beaver pond proves to be the highlight.It begins raining, and Nate's $5 poncho turns out to be no bargain, tearing like paper. At Seth, we set up tents and start a fire. Ever resourceful, Dick makes popcorn, using a pie tin and a holder/handle he fashioned out of heavy wire.Wind-whipped rain makes it difficult to sleep, and at one point we hear a tree crash to the ground not far away. We live to see the morning.Day 3The weather slowly improves as we hike over easy terrain to the Massachusetts border and the end of the Long Trail. Stopping at Eph's Lookout for lunch, we have a great view of distant mountains, but have to contend with a biting cold wind.Dick pokes fun at me as my stale pita bread crumbles while I try to wrap it around tuna from a packet.The descent over boulders toward Route 2 is hairy in places, but the walk along Sherman Brook, with the sun finally poking through, is beautiful. After crossing bridges over railroad tracks and the Hoosic River, we make our way to the van, where we drop the packs and crack a beer.Hoping to experience a bit of the local character, we go to the door of the Greylock Community Club, arriving at the same time as a member.""Is this a private club?"" Dick asks.""It's supposed to be,"" the member answers, then unlocks the door and invites us in.It's a funky little place, with $1.75 beer and free popcorn and beer-steamed hot dogs. NASCAR is on the TV, and big guys in flannel shirts make us feel welcome.On the way home, we eat at the Charlemont Inn, which serves a Berkshire Brewing Co. pale ale that is second to none.It's a great trip with the boys, who rag on each other -- and their old men -- the whole time.","Bennington, VT

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363504,"Day 1After dropping a car at Route 103 for our sons, who will leave the trail earlier than Dick and I, we park my van at Gifford Woods and hike all day in a cold rain. Everybody, and everything, eventually gets wet.With the mountains blanketed in fog, we don't bother checking out Mendon Lookout, but spirits remain high as we rag on each other and otherwise make the best of the conditions.As we get high on the back side of Killington, the boys get ahead and ambush us with snowballs. We think the patch of snow they've found is a novelty, but it's just a precursor of what was to come. Snow soon covers the trail, and the higher we go the deeper it gets. We break through to our thighs many times. The snow is saturated with water, and our feet often penetrate deep enough to land in rivulets flowing underneath. It's slow, miserable going.We cut off the AT for the side trail to Pico Camp, but have to stop several times because it's hard to pick up the blue blazes. It's after 5 p.m., and for the first time in three years of hiking the AT I'm concerned for our safety. We're cold, wet and tired; it's foggy and getting dark; and each step could be dangerous. Even though we've got some experience and are well equipped, I think, ""This is how people die in the mountains.""Finally, I find the camp, a shack with rotted sills, chicken wire to keep out the critters and a door that won't shut tight. But in these conditions and after such a grueling day, it's a palace. After soup, cheese and crackers and pepperoni, and a little booze, our spirits soar again.Day 2We awake to bright sunshine, but temperatures in the low 30s. It takes forever to break camp; after getting up at 6:30, we don't leave till almost 11. No one, it seems, wants to hike in all that snow.There's an open-air privy -- just a box with a toilet seat, really -- perched on the steep mountain side, and as I sit with my pants around my ankles I elbow my toilet paper roll off the privy and it rolls 20 feet down the hill. Fortunately, no one photographs me as I shuffle to retrieve it.When we finally hit the trail, it proves to be even tougher than Day 1. Snow, sometimes waist deep, covers the trail for most of the day. We take a half dozen steps, then break through the crust to our knees, thighs or hips, falling many times. Twice after falls, I have to take off my pack and get pulled out of the snow.After several hours of this, I say to Nate, ""I hope I never see snow again.""He answers, ""I hope I never see you again.""Eventually, we leave the snow behind as we descend to Gov. Clement Shelter, a stone lean-to that's often described as a shit hole, frequently visited by trouble-making yahoos because it's accessible by vehicle. The AT trail guide advises against staying there.But our night goes great. We have the place to ourselves, and build a big fire in the shelter's stone fireplace. Our boots are soaked after two days of hiking in the rain and snow, so we put them close to the fire, hoping they will dry. Dickie puts his brand new boots too close, however, and melts the plastic toe of one. Dick comes to the rescue, heating a rock, jamming it inside the boot and reshaping the toe. He saves Dickie from hiking out in his flip-flops.Day 3It's a beautiful day, and much of the early trail follows fast-moving Gould Brook. During one crossing, Nate slips and resoaks one of his boots.The boys leave us, and their packs, at Route 103, and return with their car to retrieve the packs and give us a king six-pack, which has been on ice in the car. It's been a great weekend with them. How often do you get to spend three days with your adult children, especially when they have kids of their own?Dick and Dickie say an emotional goodbye.Dick: ""I love you.""Dickie: ""I love you, too."" Then, ""Hey Dad, how are you set for cash?""Dick and I trudge another 2.7 miles, mostly uphill, to Minerva Hinchey Shelter, which is nice and clean, with an indoor picnic table and a folding lawn chair. The privy has a poodle painted on the seat.We pop a well deserved beer and cool the others in the spring. At night, we hear geese making a racket at a nearby pond and, in the distance, owls hooting to each other. Day 4After breakfast, I put duct tape over my blistered heels and we head off. We both bonk early, right after lunch, probably the result of staying up drinking till 11 and getting very little sleep.We cross Bully Brook near some beautiful falls, then death march to Greenwall Shelter, in a nice spot with a spring flowing just out front.Day 5I had parked my car at a business on Route 7, more than three miles from the trail crossing on the Danby-Landgrove Road, and I'm glad I did. When we reach the AT parking area on Danby-Landgrove, every car in the lot has had its windows smashed.Worried about my car, I anxiously walk to Route 7, where I find it unscathed. I drive back to pick up Dick and our packs, and we head home after one of our more adventurous trips.","Gifford Woods State Park, VT

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363765,"Day 1It's an easy, 5-mile hike to Happy Hill Shelter, built in 1998 by the Dartmouth Outing Club, with a stone foundation, arched logs, loft and a tin roof. The shelter sits in a nice spot near a clear, cold stream.I surprise Dick with 16-oz. beers that added a couple pounds to my load but proved worth the effort after the first day's hike. We spend the afternoon gathering and cutting wood, just enjoying the sunny but cold day. After eating soup, then supper, we have a great fire.Despite how the tin roof amplifies every sound,including that of dropping pine needles, I sleep very well.Day 2It doesn't take long to start raining, and it keeps up all day.Hoping to keep as much dry clothing as possible for camp, I hike in a T-shirt, while Dick breaks out an inexpensive, yellow poncho, of which he's very proud. We stop under the I-89 overpass to reorganize our gear for the wet hike ahead.West Hartford is a scene right out of the Bob Newhart Show. At Rick and Tina's Country Store, we get a hot cup of coffee -- and two beers apiece for camp -- and observe the locals. One guy in his 50s wears a hunting cap, jeans cut off so short his pockets show, high wool socks tipped with red and low work shoes.The line of the day at Rick and Tina's: ""Lousy day to hike the Appalachian Trail."" Thanks, fellas.A man standing in his garage gives us the thumbs up as we hike past. He's probably thinking, ""Better them than me.""We slog through the rain and mist to Thistle Hill Shelter. While not as nice as Happy Hill, it's fairly new and water tight, giving us a welcome respite from the weather. Soup warms our bones, booze lifts our spirits and the rain finally stops.Day 3We get a late start (9:20) for such a long day (11.8 miles). Dick's knee is really bothering him. The pain is excruciating on downhills, and because of that we're moving very slowly.We pass through several high fields with great views of the surrounding mountains. In one of the fields, we cross a base camp for three hunters who are having lunch. They tell us that the Red Sox have been eliminated from the playoffs and that the weather forecast seems decent. A ways away but in the same field, we eat lunch and enjoy the classic Vermont scene of farm, fields and mountains.Dicks fashions a splint with one of his trekking poles to keep his leg stiff on the downhills, and it seems to work. We cross a small brook where brook trout are swimming.At Route 12, it's just past 4 p.m. and we still have almost 4 tough miles to Wintturi Shelter. It takes us 3 hours to cover those remaining miles and, adding insult to Dick's injury, it rains on us.Somehow we find the shelter in the dark. Because it's late and Dick's hurting, we cut back on the usual routine, eliminating the soup course, having freeze dried meals for dinner and hanging our food off the roof in front of the shelter instead of using a bear bag.We crawl into our sleeping bags and call it a night.Day 4Dick is still in a lot of pain, and making it almost 10 miles to Stony Brook Shelter seems impossible.To lighten his load, I take his food bag, and he wraps his knee tightly. All things considered, he moves pretty well.We meet an older couple who are finishing their thru hike of the AT, needing only to reach Hanover to complete the trail. (They had already climbed Katahdin, celebrating with family, to beat the bad weather.) I'm touched when the woman tells us she has lost weight on the hike and her husband adds, ""Yes, but they were beautiful pounds.""On the climb to Lakota Lake Lookout, we see fresh moose prints in the mud. The view from the lookout is impressive, with the Whites to the east, the lake just below and dozens of miles of small mountains in between. Spectacular.Dick struggles but overcomes the pain to reach the shelter. En route, we get confused and walk the wrong way down a dirt road, the last thing Dick needs in his condition.At the shelter, we share soup with a middle-aged couple, but stay in my new tent, an REI Half Dome, which is a tight fit for two but helps keep us warm. Most of the condensation gathers on the fly and rolls off, as advertised. (I'm happy about that, after an earlier solo hike with a single-wall tent, which built up condensation that rained down on me during a thunderstorm. That tent was sent back immediately after the hike.)Day 5Dick faces a nightmarish 7 miles to Gifford Woods State Park. He wraps his knee and starts gutting it out, but I don't see how he can continue in such pain. I offer to carry more of his load, but he won't let me take more than his food bag.Though Dick is unable to enjoy it, the scenery is among the best we've seen on our AT section hikes: high fields, great stands of birch trees, vistas and brooks. Sitting beside an old logging road having lunch, I'm warmed by the sun and knowing that Dick's ordeal is almost over.We slog the final miles to Gifford Woods, and Dick is in such pain he finally lets me help him. I hike ahead a half mile or so, drop my pack, hike back and take his to the drop spot, and repeat for a couple miles.Two young women running the trail tell us we're about 45 minutes away from the state park, and they are right.We pass a beautiful waterfall at Kent Pond, then cross Route 100 to the campground, where we pick a lean-to and square up with the ranger ($21 for the night), who brings us firewood in her ATV. The campground is very quiet; it will close for the season the next week.I hoof it about a half mile to the Killington Deli, where I buy beer (an 18-pack! of Bud, plus one Long Trail IPA), a big bag of chips, almonds, cheddar cheese, Triscuits, a Mr. Goodbar and two huge grinders.Dick and I drink 14 of the beers, stuff ourselves and bullshit around the roaring camp fire till 9:30 or so, when we crawl into our bags in the shelter. Fittingly, my candle lantern burns out at just about the same time.Day 6I wake early, have a quick coffee and oatmeal, and read the previous day's paper about the Red Sox pulling out the division series against the A's. One of the hunters had led us to believe the Sox had lost the series, so this was a huge -- and welcome -- surprise, although it would mean more work for me when I return to my job as sports editor of the Worcester Telegram & Gazette.I walk back to the deli for soap, pastry and the paper, and savor a real cup of coffee while reading the sports section.Back at the campgroud, a shower feels great, even though I have to put a semi-funky shirt back on. My face, blotchy with psoriasis and irritated by medicated wipes used on the trail, looks like it's been splattered with raspberries.Postscript: Every hike is an adventure, and this one was no exception. Dick overcame incredible adversity to finish. We didn't have as much fun as on some trips, and on some nights we didn't make it to the shelters until dark. But in many ways this was the most satisfying trip yet. You always have to adjust and adapt, never more so than this time.","Hanover, NH

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363848,"Day 1After weeks of tumult at home -- my marriage falling apart, my mother-in-law near death from lung cancer, and Dick dealing with a sick aunt and problems at a motel he owns -- we hit the trail for a much-needed hike.""Little"" Bernie Duhamel drives us to Hoyt Road, and we take our time hiking 10.2 miles to Telephone Pioneer Shelter, over some of the easiest terrain we've covered in four years of section hiking. There is lots of swamp land to cross on plank walkways, and the most noticeable landmark is the Dover Oak, a monstrous tree on the side of the road.Despite the forgiving terrain, we're really whipped when we get to the shelter. Seventy-degree temperatures and a 45-minute layover at the AT railroad station did not help. But it's great to be here, and I write in my journal during happy hour.An older guy named Kevin, out on his first hike, arrives with a nice EMS pack that he bought for $6 at Goodwill. Five Scouts and two scoutmasters join the party. Thankfully, they all set up tents and leave the shelter to us.Day 2After a night of sporadic sleep, interrupted by honking geese, hooting owls, hammering woodpeckers and scurrying mice, I awake to a fire-red sunrise and wake Dick to see it.In 80-degree weather, what should have been an easy 7-mile hike to Morgan Stewart Shelter turns out to be a lot of work. The leaves are just starting to come, so the woods do not afford us much protection from the sun.At Route 55, relying on the advice of a hiker who said a store was just a half mile away, I start walking to get some beer. But the store turns out to be more than a mile away -- and it's closed ""due to family illness."" A wine and liquor store in the same strip mall does not sell beer but, fortunately, a gas station across the street does. I buy a king six-pack, a Mr. Goodbar and a 20-oz. Pepsi before trying to hitchhike back, without success.So we hoof it to Morgan Stewart lugging the extra weight, but I sing to myself, ""It ain't heavy, it's my beer.""With the Scouts from the previous day following us, we arrive to find another group claiming the shelter. But we have a wonderful, long afternoon doing camp chores and drinking, and since it's warm and clear, we later decide to sleep in the tent without the fly. While it lasts, it's very pleasant lying under just the mesh of the tent on a warm, breezy night. However, the clouds and fog blow in about 4 a.m., so I get up and put on the fly before the drizzle starts.Day 3In the fog, drizzle and occasional shower, we hike to Route 52, and I walk a half mile to a deli for -- what else? -- beer, only to be told that they don't sell till noon on Sundays, not for another 45 minutes. The clerk asks the manager if she can make an exception, but he says he can't take the chance. Bummer.By mid-afternoon we reach the PRH Shelter, a place like none we have seen: a cinderblock cabin with an open front, bunks, patio, overhang, two picnic tables and a clothesline.While Dick is making soup outside, a 4- to 5-foot black snake crawls from under the foundation of the building, just 3 feet from where he is cooking. He doesn't like being startled by snakes, so is grateful I warned him about this one being so close. But he worries that it might be in the bunkhouse at night, feeding on mice.The weather clears and we dry gear on the clothesline. I get a kick out of something scrawled in the shitter: ""Absolutely no spelunking.""Day 4A long, lean thru hiker called Officer Taco, who arrived during the night, tells us he's the No. 2 northbounder this year, knocking off as much as 42 miles in a day.While the predicted overnight thunderstorms didn't materialize, it doesn't take long for the dreary morning to turn into a rainy one. After a few words with Officer Taco, we prepare for a long day in the rain, with no shelters left on this trip.But the weather is tolerable for most of the hike, drizzling but not really raining. It's warm enough to hike in shorts and T-shirt. Later in the day, however, it's raining lightly but steadily as we arrive at the campsites where we will stay. (From my notes, I'm not really sure where that was. Fahnestock State Park, probably.)The campsites are in an open, unprotected field, so we set up in a nearby hemlock grove. Conditions turn miserable, rainy and windy with the temperature dropping into the 40s. Dick makes a lean-to with his tarp, and we have happy hour, cook and eat quickly before getting into the tent before 8. Everything is pretty wet.Day 5By 7 a.m., it's cold but at least it has stopped raining. During the night, we had heard turkeys, or perhaps hunters calling them.It turns out to be a great day to hike the 12 miles to Hemlock Springs. There's bright sunshine and it warms to the 50s. The route, at times steep and rocky, reminds me of Vermont and Massachusetts.At Route 9, it's a major disappointment to find a food mart/gas station closed, and the Pepsi machine outside the adjacent U-Haul business gives three quarters and a nickel in change for a dollar, but no soda.We've seen just one hiker so far, an older, out-of-shape guy who was struggling to get to the Mount of Atonement Monastery, where he planned to sleep in the baseball field.At Hemlock Springs, we make our own campsite, not liking the two we found along the trail.We are beset by equipment problems: my stove won't light; Dick's Thermarest has sprung a leak; and the pre-filter on my water purifier is clogged. But we make the best of on our last full day on the trail. And at least it's not raining. We use Dick's wood burning stove to cook, bypass the purifier's pre-filter by using its gravity-feed option and Dick makes do by blowing up his pad a couple times during the night.Day 6The day breaks clear and reasonable warm, and we take our time breaking camp. It's a great way to end the trip.Though I try to stay in the moment, thoughts of home lurk. When we get cell service, I check my messages, and there's one from my daughter saying the cat died while I've been gone.Dick and I hike to 9D, which is almost at Bear Mountain Bridge, along the Hudson River. On the way, we meet a Northeastern student walking her dog and she tells us a convenience store (beer!) is a mile down the road. But after I walk three-quarters of a mile or so, a telephone company worker eating his lunch tells me it's another 3 miles to the store, so I turn back.We get a message from Dick's son, I call him Moose, who says he's still an hour and a half from picking us up. So I decide to hitchhike to that store. But at the bridge, a construction worker tells me there's another one, on the other side of the Hudson, just a mile and half away. I walk the round trip in less than an hour, returning with a king six-pack of Bud and a big bag of Lays potato chips.While we wait, I have to take a crap, and just as I find the perfect spot four 50-something women come down the trail. I tell them that had they been a few minutes later they would have had quite the show, displaying my toilet paper and trowel.We finish the beer and wait for the Moose, happy that another hike has ended with an adventure.","Hoyt Road, NY

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/393543,"Day 1On a warm, sunny day, we struggle to hike the 9 miles to Brien Memorial Shelter. The views of the Hudson River and nearby mountains are spectacular, but Bear Mountain, West Mountain and finally Black Mountain prove taxing.The shelter is made of boulders, and its plywood floor was moldy from the leaking roof, but as usual, we make it home and, as usual, other hikers arrive just before dark. They are SOBO thru hikers, ex-Marines from Tennessee and Virginia. They are very nice, very fit guys traveling light, so light that one of them declines our offer to take surplus ramen soup when they leave. That prompts Dick to say he won't take a package of dried soup but he straps a piano to his back. In reality, he is carrying a somewhat smaller instrument, a mandolin.They describe an encounter with a rattler on the NY/Conn. border in which one of them, seeing the snake was not coiled and assuming it would not strike, slapped its tail to get it to rattle. (Years later, after Pilot and I meet up with a timber rattler in Pennsylvania, I realize how foolhardy these guys were.)Day 2After an easy 5-mile hike, we eat lunch at Fingerbowl Shelter, a structure made of rock, with dual fireplaces, perched on a slab over looking a ravine. As I'm getting water, two Norwich co-eds emerge from the woods, wearing running clothes with numbers, and carrying just water, a map and compass.""Sir, have you seen a knoll with something orange on it?"" one of them asks.They are orienteering and have no clue where they are. Their map has little in common with my AT map. After warning them that I smelled after a day on the trail, I try to help. We decide they had overshot to the north, and they plan to double back. I tell them if they get lost, to take the AT south back to the highway.On our way to a stealth campsite near Island Pond, we pass over the Lemon Squeezer, a rock formation with a narrow slot. To negotiate one hairy drop-off, we take off our packs and lower them before jumping down.It starts raining right after we set up camp, but by this time we're safely under the Tyvek, eating the traditional pepperoni, cheese and fish crackers and drinking during happy hour.Day 3The rain clears and it's a beautiful, cloudless day in the 60s.We fall short of our goal to reach Wildcat Shelter, partly because the terrain was tougher than we expected and partly because I take a detour to a deli that doesn't sell beer. The approach to Arden Mountain, called the Agonizer, a steep jumble of rocks that gains 600 feet in 1/4 mile, is particularly tough.We camp below Fitzgerald Falls, a beautiful 25-foot drop in the spruce and boulder forest. It's illegal to camp here, and after setting up we realize we're just 30 yards from trails on each side. Several day hikers and others in the woods spot us, making it a little uncomfortable.Day 4It was an uneasy night, being so close to the trails and the popular falls. Shortly after I fell asleep, some yahoo let out a whoop, which kept us on guard for hours.Though moisture from a thick fog drips from the trees and wets the rain fly, the day turns out sunny and clear.So far, I'm impressed with the trail through New York south of Bear Mountain. Though it's not particularly high, its hills are challenging and there are lots of unusual rock formations, like the Lemon Squeezer. Today we hit Cat Rocks, which feature an opening shaped like a cat's head; the Pinnacles, a high outcropping with great views; and Prospect Rock, with its fine view of Greenwood Lake and one of its islands. There are also dozens of unnamed, whale-like rock formations that form a miles-long spine of hard hiking. There are some hairy descents, too.Dick and I have hot dogs and cokes at a stand on Route 17A, a welcome change from the usual energy bars and water.We find a neat place to camp on a knoll on Long House Creek. Again, this is illegal, but we didn't have the energy to make it 2 1/2 miles to the next shelter.The cap on my flask cracks open during the day, costing me precious sips of vodka and coffee brandy, so I pour what's left into the soda bottle we had saved.Day 5We get our usual late start - 9:15 - despite getting up at 7, and we make good time on the easy terrain.It's a wicked drop from Pinwheel View down to a field that leads to Route 94.
On the way down, we meet a couple who tell us a big farmers' market on Route 94 might sell beer. It doesn't, but we stuff ourselves with other stuff. Dick has a Coke, an orange, an ice cream cone and a pancake-sized pastry. I have an ice cream, a delicious apple turnover and a Gatorade.
We climb stairs and cross a field right past Angus cattle. When it gets sloppy, we walk on puncheon. When Dick steps on the far end of one puncheon, the other end lifts and I trip over it, going into a slow motion dance trying to catch my balance. Since that is impossible with a heavy frame pack, I end up doing a face plant in the water that's polluted with cow manure and urine.
We cross a huge swamp on an impressive system of boardwalks that must stretch for a mile and includes a bridge 15-20 feet over a creek. Warned about polluted water in the area, we're happy to find a gallon jug of water marked ""fresh"" just as we start looking for a place to camp.
We find a nice spot after passing through a field with four-wheeler tracks, then our imaginations get the better of us. After hearing a four-wheeler apparently stop and idle, we see several lights in the direction of the field. Thinking a group of four-wheeling yahoos has spotted us, we kill our cooking fire and stare at the lights for what seemed like an hour. Dick and I think we see flashlights in the woods and people passing in front of the lights. After standing motionless in the dark, freezing our asses off, we finally figure out that the lights we're seeing are streetlights.
I'm impressed with the trail in New York and New Jersey, but there are too many people around. Today, for example, we hear a marching band practice for some of the hike, and a kid whizzes by on a dirt bike.
Day 6
On our way to Unionville - and our first beer since Friday - we pass around the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge, the only NWR on the trail, according to the guide. It's about a mile around the enormous swamp, and we see two deer, a woodchuck, several hawks and billions of newly hatched mosquitoes. The swamp is beautiful, in its own way.
At Lott Road, I hike a half-mile to Unionville and finally I score: A small grocery store has beer. I also get Pringles, Cheez-its, Coke, water and an ice cream sandwich. 
We hike a mile or two out of town and set up camp in a sunny spot - the most remote location we can find - next to a road and, we hope, an abandoned field.
Dick and I enjoy beer, Pringles and each other's company. Life is good.
Day 7
It's another warm, sunny day and we have a pretty easy, though uphill, hike to High Point Shelter, not far from High Point Monument, the highest point in New Jersey.
On the way we meet Mountain Goat, a middle-aged guy from South Carolina who was plodding along alone after hiking with friends for a few days. He's been chipping away at the trail for more than 10 years, starting in Georgia.
The shelter, circa 1936, is made of stone with a tin roof, and has a critter we can hear stirring under the wood floor. Built by the CCC, the building, with its hand-hewn beams, can probably withstand falling trees, hurricane-force winds and whatever else nature throws at it.
We are looking forward to a lazy afternoon, when a staff member from a youth group arrives with a crate of food. She says two other adults and eight middle school and high school kids will be here in a couple hours.
The kids and their counselors set up a short distance from the shelter. One staffer tells us they're borderline kids with behavioral problems, but they seem fine out here. They all sleep under the stars, while we stay in the shelter.
I admire the adults for taking the time and making the effort to make a difference in these kids' lives.
Day 8
We have the whole morning to kill before we need to hike the 1 1/2 miles to Route 23 to meet Dick's son, Dickie, a.k.a. Moose.
After the youth group leaves, the place is amazingly peaceful. It's sunny and warm, reminding me of down time during Army field exercises in Germany more than 30 years ago.
Being out here isn't so much an escape as a way to immerse yourself in what you're doing without distraction. It isn't until today - in the pre-dawn - that thoughts of responsibilities and problems at work creep into my mind. Still, being here in the woods, sunshine and warmth, and near water, makes it easy to let all that go until I get home.
After lunch (when my stove runs out of fuel and we finish cooking the rice dish over a small wood fire), we hike out to Route 23 at High Point Park headquarters. There's a platform atop the hill with sweeping views of the mountains and valleys, but we can't see New York City. Of course, we aren't sure in which direction to look.","Bear Mountain Bridge, New York

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394436,"Day 1Dick and I hike 7.5 miles over pretty easy terrain to Ore Hill Shelter. We had planned to stop sooner - at beer drop No. 1, the first of four places where we had planted a total of five (!!) six-packs.Since two cans had been punctured, we drink those on site and I carry the other four to the shelter for happy hour.I like my new Mountainsmith pack, which carries 41 pounds (plus another couple from Dick) comfortably. My neck, which an MRI showed to have arthritis, bone spurs and narrowing of the foramer, fares better than with the old frame pack.At the lunch stop, the stem of my watch pops out after snagging on the pack strap. Ever resourceful, Dick pokes a tool from his Leatherman into the watch to get it running.The shelter, vintage 1999, is spacious, with a nice fire pit and lots of dry wood to burn. Life is good.
Day 2
We get a late start, figuring we're only hiking four miles to the next beer drop, but the weather is threatening and we decide to push on to Hexacuba Shelter. No sooner do we make that decision and start up Mt. Cube when it starts to rain lightly. Near the summit, it turns to snow.
Dick and I slog up the mountain and down a hairy descent over slick rocks to the shelter, a cool, six-sided job with two sides open. It's 38 degrees, and it doesn't take long for us to get cold. Still, we drink the beer we lugged from Brackett Brook.
The shelter, while an inventive hexagon cut into the side of the mountain, is beautiful but drafty. We can't get warm. Dick even puts a space blanket under his fleece. After eating a great spiced stew, we pitch the tent in the shelter, which worked well, keeping us warm while the wind howled all night.
Day 3
It's still very windy, but not raining in the morning. As we slog toward Smarts Mountain, the big question is: Is there snow up there at 3,240 feet? While the trail is not steep, it is very sloppy.
About a mile from the summit, we see a trail runner coming down, and he gives us the bad news that there's snow on the trail and the good news that it's hikeable. We plod through the mess on the ground while the wind whips overhead and fog occasionally blows in.
There's moose scat about every 20 yards, as well as occasional tracks and coyote scat.
The cabin is a welcome sight. It's very funky but it's home: four walls, a roof, windows and a door that latches. Dicks builds a makeshift table and we make ourselves at home. The wind is still howling, but it's much warmer in the cabin than in the last shelter.
Again, the wind blows all night, but the cabin is tight and we stay pretty comfortable.
Day 4
The sun has yet to blow off the mist, but we can tell the weather is going to improve -- and it does. It gets sunny and warmer, which we feel we deserve after the cold, wind and rain of the weekend.
The descent from Smarts Mountain is very steep, with some slippery slabs to cross and some old ice. It would have been much worse a week or two earlier, or if it were raining.
Lambert Ridge has picture postcard view after picture postcard view, something we didn't get on Mt. Cube or Smarts Mountain because of the weather.
Trapper John Shelter is an interesting place. The shelter itself is standard, but the site has a 15-foot tall stone fireplace out front, a gorgeous stream 50 yards away -- and a 50-foot pine that has fallen no farther than 10 feet in front of the shelter. It doesn't look like it's been long since the tree fell or that anyone has stayed at the shelter since.
We couldn't ask for a more convenient source of firewood, and Dick goes to work with his trusty saw to cut up the night's supply.
The privy is unique, with a captain's chair, back and arm rests included, perched over the honey hole.
We have the mother of all fires and still leave wood for backpackers to come.
Day 5
While Trapper John proves a nice place to stay, the Moose Mountain Shelter is just spectacular: built from logs atop the mountain, facing the Whites to the east and with a nice fireplace.
A hiker named Mike, out for 10 days and hiking north, joins us about 3 p.m.
The hike to get here is a real grind, with lots of climbing in warm, sunny weather, but you can't beat the views. Holts Ledge, part of which is closed because of nesting peregrine falcons, afford nice views of the Whites, and at several points up the mountain we stop and take them in.
We have another great fire. The site, new in 2002, has not been heavily used, and there is lots of wood right near the shelter.
Day 6
Dick and I start the day about 5 a.m. by sitting on the edge of the shelter and watching the sunrise.
We take our time breaking camp, with just a short way to go and it being all down hill, and have a leisurely stroll out of the mountains, through the woods and a nice field, then into the pine groves to Etna-Hanover Road, where we have two six-packs hidden.
After getting water from a stream off Mink Brook, we find a site less than a half-mile away, and Dick prepares the fiddlehead ferns he picked in the field.
The night is incredibly windy, and I worry about blowdowns after seeing the tree at Trapper John Shelter. The tall pines sway, creak and sometimes crack, but nothing falls on us.
Still, I have a hard time getting comfortable and sleep very little.
Day 7
The morning is about 40 degrees and still windy. Gas is running low and the first cup of coffee is tepid and the oatmeal pasty. I coax a second, hotter cup of coffee out of the canister.
The hike to Velvet Rock Shelter just outside Hanover is short, varied and beautiful. It's sunny and clear, making my favorites stretches - through evergreens with big boulders - even more appealing. I'm always amazed at how big trees can grow on some of those boulders.
The shelter is old, tiny and well-used. I hope the fact that it's Thursday and pretty cold means we won't get partiers here tonight. Thankfully, no partiers, or other hikers for that matter, show up.
Dick and I spend a long, lazy afternoon at the Velvet Rocks site. After the usual chores, we nap in the sun on rocks behind the shelter. It's clear, but cool and windy, and the warmth of the sun feels great.
After dinner we have a brief fire, but afterward we get cold in our bags, which have lost some loft over the years. A beautiful slice of hangs near the horizon around midnight and an owl visits the site.
Day 8
We have only 1 1/2 miles to Hanover, where Phyl picks us up.
This has been one of my favorite trips, with fantastic scenery and mostly good weather. We handled the bad weather well. Dick and I passed through no towns, and saw very few people.
I appreciate these trips more each time I do them, maybe because I never know how long we'll be able to keep it up. This time, I thought about almost nothing but hiking. It was great.","Glencliff, NH

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394729,"Day 1On the ride over the Kancamagus Highway, Dick and I see a moose carcass on the side of the road, something you don't see every day. And on the return trip, we see another moose, this one very much alive.The eight miles to Imp Shelter is mostly an uphill slog, made more difficult by several blowdowns along the trail. Some are very difficult to get over or under; in a couple cases, Dick and I get on our hands and knees and crawl.Except for a day hiker and his dog at the start, we don't see another hiker all day and have the shelter - a log A-frame with a neat loft - to ourselves until 6 the next morning, when a lone backpacker arrives.The sunset is one of the best I've seen anywhere: row upon row of mountains in varying shades of blue/gray, puffy clouds above and a red, fading sun. The water source is a steep sluiceway.
Day 2
It's a long, tough climb up to North Carter Mountain, and I'm thinking this would be very difficult in bad weather. Still, the view of Mt. Washington is worth every step.
Dick and I climb Mt. Hight and make the brutal descent into Carter Notch.
The notch is a neat place - a couple boulder-filled ponds and a hut complex surrounded on all sides by high, steep mountains.
The complex has a self-service hut, which works out better than I thought with hikers sharing the stove and sink, and two bunkhouses. Fortunately, no one bunks with us, probably because we hung the choke chicken - a rubber chicken with a noose around its neck - prominently in front of the door.
Day 3
The day's hike starts and finishes with a tough hill, up and down Wildcat Mountain. The downhill is steep and treacherous, the worst, I think, since we've been hiking.
We pass a girl who's climbing with a calico cat on top of her pack. As Dave Barry might say, I am not making this up.
We find Joe Dodge Lodge in Pinkham Notch more luxurious than expected, with private rooms, sheets on the beds and locks on the doors. Directly across the hall from our room, we find a family who are close friends of Dick and his wife. What are the chances?
At dinner in the lodge, a woman named Joyce plunks down next to us. She's 63, drove a Camaro here from her home in North Conway and smokes cigars. Joyce is self-absorbed and talks way too much, but she's a character and is definitely entertaining.
Day 4
The hike up to Madison is a killer, at least until we hit the treeline, where it's cooler and the footing is better. There's a great view of Washington and the auto road winding up its flank.
It's windy enough for us to put on jackets to cross the ridge. Clouds blow in, but it doesn't rain.
Madison Hut is incredibly cramped. The two rooms with their four-tier bunks are filled, and I'm not looking forward to the night.
But things work out better than expected as we strike up a rapport with three Canadians and some hikers from Westborough, Mass., who are leading a group of Scouts. (Five years later, I would begin hiking with one of those leaders, Dana ""Pilot"" Perry, whose own exploits are chronicled on Trail Journals.) Everyone is headed to Lakes of the Clouds Hut the following day.
Earplugs enable me to sleep pretty well, but those without them are kept awake by heavy snoring, none louder than Dick, who's world class.
Day 5
It rains, and sometimes pours, all the way to Lakes of the Clouds, and it doesn't take long for all that high tech gear to get soaked. Above treeline for the whole day, we only stop to adjust gear and get lunch from our packs. This is one of those hikes when we see how people can die in the White Mountains. We have all the right stuff, and still we are cold and wet, and we almost get lost. We inadvertently take the West Side Trail, which goes under the summit and rejoins the AT about a mile from the hut.
Given the conditions, we're glad to get to the hut. The bunkrooms, with 15 people per room, are hung with soaked gear.
The wind howls and the rain falls into the night. About 11, a kid in our room having a nightmare starts screaming.
Day 6
As we pack up, a teenage boy innocently comes out with the quote of the trip: ""Hey, Dad, isn't this [stuff] supposed to be waterproof?"" That gets a laugh out of everyone in the bunkroom.
It's cloudy and foggy, but not raining when we start. Still the wind is wild and we leave the hut in full - and still soaked - rain gear. After we walk through some wind gusts on the ridge, it clears enough to see the view and the sun even comes out.
We reach Mizpah, one of the best huts in the system, just after noon. I'm finally able to get phone messages from my daughter. I really miss her and feel bad about not making contact for a couple days.
Dick and I learn that our Canadian friends are staying in our room and hang the choke chicken in anticipation. We know they'll get a kick out of it. Then, like just about everyone else, we spread our clothes on the rocks outside to dry.
We have a great afternoon lounging in the sun and hanging with the Canadians. One of them, Francoise, hangs her stuff in the trees, prompting Dick to crack, ""A chipmunk was using your underwear for a hammock.""
Day 7
About 5 a.m., while looking out the bathroom window after taking a whiz, I spot a critter that a croo member later tells me was probably a pine martin.
We leave the group at Mizpah and head out for our last day of hiking. Rain is in the forecast, and it starts - and stays - two hours later. We catch some great views from Mt. Jackson, then Mt. Webster, which is spectacular and scary. I fear the descent. But even though it's raining buckets, it's easier than I expected.
Dick and I finish the hike two hours before the scheduled shuttle pickup, so decide to walk to the Highland Center. On the way, during a downpour, we stick out our thumbs and to our surprise a woman driving a van stops. She is en route to pick up a group of teen-age hikers and gives us a welcome ride to the Highland Center, where we change into dry clothes and finish my booze with coffee in the comfortable lounge before catching the shuttle back to Pinkham Notch.

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/394816,"(I had no way of knowing this, but this would be my last AT section hike with good buddy Dick Hibbard. The following April, his home and attached business burned to the ground, and he lost just about everything - including his desire to hike the AT.)To avoid hiking after driving for several hours, we spend the night before this hike in Joe Dodge Lodge in Pinkham Notch.Day 1After an enormous breakfast of eggs, home fries, sausage, coffee cake, toast and coffee, we drive to Gorham to meet Bruce Feige, who shuttles us to Grafton Notch. Despite how steep the terrain looks from the parking lot, it's not a bad hike to Speck Pond, a beautiful tarn where AMC has a shelter and several tent platforms. Dick and I enjoy the sweeping vistas along the way.Already we see several thru hikers who plan to reach Katahdin by early October. Dick and I have the campsite to ourselves all afternoon, and we have a beer by Speck Pond.About 5 p.m., the thru hikers begin to arrive. The first is an Englishman who calls himself Charlie Foxtrot who is wearing a skirt. He is followed by Boulder, who says fuuuuuuck a lot; and Arizona, an older guy who repeats everything he's told, then says ""see what I'm saying?""All have horror stories about Mahoosuc Notch, where Dick and I are headed the following day.Day 2We leave at 8, an early start for us. The descent from Mahoosuc Arm is long but not as bad as we expected. The mile-long notch seems to be as advertised, and we break for lunch an hour and a half after starting it, and we're not done yet.We go up, down, over, under and around the boulders, and the footing is treacherous. My hands and legs are all nicked up from the rocks.Dick gets stuck in one spot with his pack on, and I can't resist the opportunity to fart in his face - payback from his many indiscretions along the trail - before helping him get free.Dick and I also cross paths with the infamous Minnesota Smith and a couple others in the notch, where they tell us they have spent the night. I can't imagine that, since there's not only no place to lie down, but seemingly no place to sit.We make it through the notch in a total of 1:45 and climb a mile to the south summit of Fulling Mill Mountain. Between two bog bridges, I step into knee-deep mud, despite the warning from the folks at Speck Shelter. Still smarting from the humiliation of me farting in his face in the notch, Dick laughs his ass off at my misstep.We then drop 1/2 mile to Full Goose Shelter, where there's a group of Outward Bound kids and four thru hikers. Most people are staying in tents, but Dick, a thru hiker named Scout and I share the large shelter.Scout is 48 but could pass for 30. She says she's recently divorced from a comedian who has worked jabs about her into his stand-up act. In her own way, she strikes back by singing about him in her original songs, accompanying herself on the strum stick she carries.About an hour after we turn in, another wave of Outward Bound kids arrive. They've been hiking in the dark and the rain, and even though there's plenty of room in the shelter, the leaders make them camp outside. Whew.
Day 3
Dick and I spend a lazy morning wrapped in our bags, shooting the shit with Scout, who's full of stories about bears, snowstorms, wacky hikers, you name it.
We break camp about 10 and hike a gorgeous four miles to Carlo Col Shelter, a big one with a loft. The stretch is one of the prettiest yet, with 360-degree mountain views, high bogs and a touch of colorful foliage. I never get tired of these views, or take them for granted.
Day 4
After a night in the shelter with one thru hiker and several guys from New York, we wake to a 35-degree morning and hike just over five miles to Gentian Pond Shelter.
The wind along the way is wild, especially on 3,500-foot Mt. Success. We cross thigh-deep bogs on puncheon.
The shelter is a beauty, with a nice view of the Carter-Moriah Range that changes as the sun shifts throughout the afternoon.
Eleven hikers end up packing the shelter, with five of us in the loft and six sleeping below. This is far too many people in one place for my comfort. It's too crowded, there's too much gear and it's too noisy. Had I known this many people would show up, I would have pitched my tent.
Here's a bit of trivia we pick up: It's thru hiker tradition to moon the cog rail train on Mt. Washington. Apparently, it's also become tradition for the cog crew to throw coal at the mooners.
Day 5
Though it took me a long time to fall asleep with thru hiker Rabbit's feet in my face, I've slept surprisingly well, getting up only once to pee (and taking great care not to step on anyone when I stepped down from the loft).
Until this point in my section hiking, I've enjoyed the thru hikers I've encountered. But at this shelter, in a clique, they seem full of themselves and inconsiderate of others around them. I hope it's just because they've come so far and are excited to be so close to Katahdin.
The five miles to the Trident Col Tentsite is pretty easy. We pass several pretty ponds on the way, stopping at one to have lunch and rest in the sun.
From a half dozen tent pads, we pick one that's removed from the others and set up the tent. Then, we have a snack of ramen soup, wash with hot water - I even change my underwear! - and prepare for happy hour. Life is good.

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/362336,"After a 5-year hiatus, I was finally back on the AT. 
From 2000, when I turned 50 and decided to section hike the AT rather than have a more traditional midlife crisis, I had been hiking with good buddy Dick Hibbard. We'd do a week each spring and a week each fall, and through the fall of 2006 we had done the AT from High Point, N.J., to Grafton Notch, Maine. But in the spring of 2007, Dick's home and attached business burned. Life hasn't been the same for him since, and he stopped hiking.
I did solo backpacks in the Berkshires of Massachusetts and the Whites of New Hampshire, and began taking group trips with the Worcester Chapter of AMC. That's where I met Pilot, who has section hiked just about the same chunk of the AT as I have, and asked me to join him on future sections, starting in the spring of 2012.
First, however, I want to catch up to Pilot by hiking small pieces of Jersey and Maine that he has done that I haven't. So, the plan this week was to start by leaving my car in Grafton Notch, get a ride to South Arm Road, and hike 20 miles south over three days.
Day One began with promise. The weather was perfect, and my shuttle and I both arrived almost an hour early at the notch. After what seemed like a short ride, the driver dropped me off at the trail crossing, I stepped into the woods and he drove away. But as I was fiddling with my gear, I noticed the sign said Grafton Notch was 10 miles away when it should have been 20. The driver had dropped me in the wrong spot. I tried to call him on my cell, but there was no service.
I was half done with my AT hike, and I hadn't taken a single step.
So it was on to Plan B, in which I decided to do the 10 miles of the AT from East B Hill Road, where I was mistakenly dropped, to Grafton Notch, then make up the lost 10 miles by doing a bit of the Grafton Loop Trail.
With change comes opportunity, they say, so I took advantage of the situation and detoured to check out Dunn Falls, a 60-footer that's well worth the short hike from the AT.
In the warm, sunny conditions, it was a tough slog up East Baldpate, which was steep, rocky and slippery, but beautiful, with incredible views of the mountains and lakes of southwestern Maine. I arrived at the Baldpate Lean-to, just two miles from my car, and decided to tent at that site. I thought I'd see lots of thru hikers on this trip, but they were apparently long gone, with time running short to reach Katahdin, still more than 200 miles away.
No one was in the shelter or on the tent sites; I had the place to myself. It was so quiet, I could hear the leaves softly hitting the ground. Whenever I camp alone in the wilderness, I'm more aware of sounds in the night. Often, that keeps me awake. I didn't sleep well at Baldpate, but not because of critters rustling in the leaves. Only once during the night did I hear something small - a marten, maybe? - scurry past the tent. I just couldn't sleep. But I was warm, comfortable and happy to be back on the trail.
Day Two started with promise, too, but like Day One, things didn't turn out as planned. Plan B turned into Plan C.
I took my time breaking camp, enjoying breakfast and two cups of Starbucks instant, as well as the stillness and solitude of the woods. Before reaching my car, I hiked a side trail to Table Rock, a flat outcropping that affords splendid views of Grafton Notch, surrounding mountains and Route 26, snaking through the forest far below.
It was another perfect early fall day, and I was in a great frame of mind. I had put the disappointment of the drop-off screwup behind me, deciding that I can always make up the piece of the AT I missed another time. And I appreciated the chance to take in Dunn Falls and Table Rock, which I probably would not have done in a point-to-point AT hike.
After picnicking in Grafton Notch, my plan was to park on the southern part of the Grafton Loop Trail, hike west and stay at the Sargent Brook Campsite. But I couldn't find the western GLT trailhead after hiking down Route 26, where it was supposed to be. So, I decided to hike the GLT east, since that trailhead was at the parking lot, climb Puzzle Mountain and camp at Stewart Campsite.
Puzzle Mountain may just be the toughest 3,000-footer I've ever hiked, at least approaching it from the west. Perhaps it earned its name because every time you reach exposed granite, thinking you've reached the top, you see there's still higher ground. In warm weather (and undoubtedly in wet weather) this mountain will beat you down. But the views are many, and they are spectacular. At one of them, I stretched out on the rocks, taking in the sights and enjoying the warm sun.
After the summit, I hiked a mile or so before coming to a sign that mentioned Town Corner Campsite another five miles away, but not Stewart Campsite, which should have been within a mile. That made me worry. It was late afternoon, I had already hiked 8 1/2 miles that day, and I was tired and short of water. There was no way I wanted to hike to Town Corner, which involved tackling another 3,000-footer. I feared if I pressed on for Stewart, and it didn't exist, I wouldn't have enough daylight left to make it back to the car. And since it wasn't an emergency, I didn't want to stealth camp on private property.
So, on to Plan C, in which I hiked out and drove home, but not before stopping at the Sunday River Brewery in Bethel, where I had a pastrami sandwich, fries and a great IPA.
When I came out of the woods, I was thru hiker hungry and marathon runner thirsty. I drank so much water, one liter of it mixed with Gatorade powder, that after the beer I could only eat half my sandwich and fries. But when the bloat subsided about an hour later, I stopped at a convenience store for a 20-ounce Sprite and a Klondike Bar. At home, around midnight, I finished the pastrami and fries, washing them down with a Sam Adams lager.
Trip postscripts: I contacted the Maine Appalachian Trail Club and did some online research about the GLT, only to find that I hadn't hiked far enough down the road to find the western trailhead (though it would have been nice to see markers on trees or poles) or far enough on the eastern side of the trail to reach Stewart Campsite (though it would have been nice had it been listed on the sign after Puzzle Mountain).
While I was disappointed not to spend my second night on the trail, I'm glad I decided to play it safe and turn back. Being 61 and alone in the wilderness made the decision for me.
Gatorade powder is a must for long, hot days.
I'm glad my multi-tool had a flat-head screwdriver small enough to fix my glasses when a lens fell out. Memo to self: pack an extra pair of specs, just in case.","South Arm Road, supposedly

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/380922,"This trip, a roughly 75-mile stretch from Port Clinton to DWG, marked my first week-long trip on the AT in five years.While hiking buddy Pilot and I had heard the horror stories about Pennsylvania's infamous rocks, I didn't find them as bad as advertised. Here's how one hiker described them in a shelter log: ""6 more miles and this shitty state is over. I think I'd rather hike the PCT w/ Joan Rivers and the women from The View than do this state again.""Sure, there were difficult stretches and I fell a couple times. My arm and my ego took a bruising, but nothing got broken, and I found that the long stretches through mountain laurel, ferns and blueberry bushes more than made up for the punishing rocks.Luck was with Pilot and me for the whole trip. For example:- There were several violent thunderstorms during the week, but we never had to break out the rain gear. That's because we were either holed up in B&Bs or had taken shelter on the trail for the night when they occurred.- One B&B where we stayed lost power, but not before the owner had cooked and served our breakfast.- I missed stepping on a timber rattler, and it didn't strike when we dashed past as it lay coiled on the side of the trail. (Olympic sprinters could not have moved faster than we did, even though we were exhausted and carried full packs.)- I had been craving two things on hottest days of hiking: beer and popsicles. After Day 4, we found a cooler, left by a trail angel, with beer. The owner of the B&B who then picked us up greeted us with glasses of lemonade, and when we got to the inn she gave me a freeze pop and two more beers. Nice.The views of Pennsylvania farmland from on high were awesome, especially given that there are so few farms left in Massachusetts, where we live.In almost 700 miles of AT section hiking, I'd never seen such a variety of wildlife as we saw on this trip. The highlight was the timber rattler, of course, but we also saw a big deer, bluebirds (near the Palmerton Superfund site, no less), orioles, scarlet tanagers, black snakes, raptors and wood ticks - lots of 'em - one of which hitched a ride to Massachusetts embedded in my shoulder. My sleep was interrupted while tenting near Eckville Shelter by a piercing scream and ruckus that fellow tenter Stumpknocker attributed to a rabbit that ""got it"" from a coyote.Pilot's planning, which included two days of slackpacking and two nights at B&Bs, plus lots of luck helped make this a memorable trip.Two down notes: Yahoos camped near Kirkridge Shelter lit fireworks into the night on Thursday. And the waitress at a diner in DWG, apparently dissing us as hiker trash, pretty much ignored us after we sat down, never taking our order. We left for Applebee's, where we got better service.Next up for Pilot, Greenie and possibly others: Maine, from Rangeley to Caratunk.","Port Clinton, Pa.

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/392352,"        Maine 2012In 12 years of section hiking the AT, this trip, in which I hiked 100 miles from Caratunk to East B Hill Road near Andover in western Maine, was one of the most memorable.        Memorable because of the beauty of Maine’s mountains, woods and lakes. Memorable because of the inspiring people I met on the trail. Memorable because for the fourth straight backpacking trip this summer, we dodged severe weather. And most of all, memorable because there was so much trail magic this time out.        My trip was broken in two parts: staying at the Pine Ellis Hiker Lodge in Andover and slackpacking from Rangeley to East B Hill; and backpacking from Caratunk to Rangeley with hiking buddy Dana “Pilot” Perry, who had already done the section I was slackpacking.        Let me tell you, I got very spoiled slackpacking out of Pine Ellis. I ended each hike, in which I carried less than 10 pounds on my back, with a hot shower, a few beers in the double swing on the front porch, a meal in town or in the hostel’s kitchen, and a comfortable bunk. I also got to meet many northbound thru hikers who stayed at Pine Ellis while they slackpacked the AT in the area, and got to see some of them again after Dana and I drove to Caratunk and started hiking south.        Words can’t describe it        While I won’t say western Maine’s beauty exceeds that of the White Mountains in New Hampshire, it does rival it, in my humble opinion. As I said to Pilot and others in Maine, you just run out of superlatives to describe the views, many of which include mountains and lakes as far as the eye can see.         One thru hiker I met at Pine Ellis and whose path we crossed hiking SOBO from Caratunk was Miller Time, a man in his late 50s from Utah. He had just gone over Bigelow Mountain and taken in the morning clouds covering the valley and lakes below. “It’s almost enough to make you cry,” he said, without a hint of corniness or overstatement.        I loved the lakes, with their undeveloped shores and loons calling out in the night, the streams and the waterfalls.Water played a big role in this hike. On Day 1 with Dana, we were crossing Pierce Pond Stream when I ragged on him for taking the log bridge across while real hikers – like me – rock hopped it. No sooner were the words out of my mouth than I slipped and fell in, submerging both feet.        After the remnants of Hurricane Isaac dropped 1-3 inches of rain, we were unable to cross the south branch of the Carrabassett River, and instead accepted a ride from the owner of the Stratton Motel around the crossing to Mt. Sugarloaf, which we climbed via a ski trail to the blue-blazed connector to the AT. Atop the mountain, we got out of the wind, mist and cold to eat lunch in an abandoned, dilapidated, rodent-infested warming hut, which, given the conditions outside, seemed like the Taj Mahal to us.        By the time we got to Oberton Stream, the water had dropped to knee depth, and fording it was easy – so easy that even I didn’t fall in.                Dodging bullets, and raindrops        This was my fourth backpacking trip this year; others included a section of the AT in Pennsylvania and two on the Long Trail in Vermont. And each time there was severe weather, thunderstorms in Pennsylvania or torrential rain in Maine, for example, we were either off trail or in shelter for the night. The only time we put on rain gear was this trip, as we neared the top of Mt. Sugarloaf, to ward off the chill from the blowing mist.        Most of this was just shit luck, of course, but in Maine we rode out the last gasp of Hurricane Isaac with an extra night in the Stratton Motel, at the suggestion of Pilot, who had been watching the weather closely. He predicted the rain would stop by 9 a.m. the day we were to resume hiking and, sure enough, by 8:30 it was over.        People storiesOne of the best things about long distance hiking is the people you meet, and every one of them has a story.        My first night at Pine Ellis, I went into town for dinner with Kinda, who would finish Maine before I left for Caratunk. Kinda was about 60 and had been a teacher and Peace Corps worker, as was her husband, currently in Afghanistan working for some non-governmental organization. She had suffered a brain aneurysm followed by a stroke. After rehab, here she was hiking the Appalachian Trail – alone. Remarkable.        Also at Pine Ellis, I met three Japanese bear hunters, who showed up one night dressed in camouflage and carrying rifles in cases. At one point, the hunter who spoke the best English asked me why people hike the Appalachian Trail. In the interest of international relations, I didn’t answer his question with one of my own, “Why do people bait and shoot bears?” Instead, I told him we hike for the challenge, the beauty and the camaraderie of the trail.        Everyone who stays at Pine Ellis knows David, the former son-in-law of the owner and the hostel’s chief shuttle driver, trail adviser and jack of all trades. I got a kick out of one entry in the hostel’s journal, which wished David luck finding the right woman, preferably one with good teeth and a driver’s license. Every day at happy hour, I slipped David a bottle of whatever microbrew I was drinking, and on my last day I wrapped a $10 bill around the neck of a bottle with an elastic and handed it to him as a tip for his driving – and for saving me one day from hiking in the wrong direction in Rangeley.        On the trail, I met the Honeymoon Couple, who ended their thru hike last year by getting married on the summit of Mt. Katahdin. To celebrate their first anniversary, they were thru hiking again this year.        At the Little Swift River Pond campsite, I ate lunch with Peter Pan, a young woman from Portland, Maine, who had hiked ahead of three male companions – I referred to them as the Lost Boys – to start cooking their meal. Wearing a green dress, Peter Pan looked the part, and told me her group had deliberately slowed their pace, knowing they were only about 200 miles from finishing the trail. She had no idea what she’d do after hiking the AT.        And I have to mention Trail Mama, whom we met at the hostel in Stratton. She had driven to Maine from Georgia in support of her husband, SOS, who was thru hiking. Originally, they both planned to hike, but were hurt in a car crash. Her injuries left her unable to join her husband on the trail, so she provided shuttle and resupply service for his trek. In the process, she often did the same for other hikers, hence the name Trail Mama.        The magic of the trailBut mostly, this was the hike of trail magic. I had seen it before, notably in Pennsylvania, where we arrived at one road crossing to find a cooler with muffins and ice cold Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Here in Maine, however, magic just seemed to be in the air. It was everywhere, and it was contagious.        While slackpacking, I finished hikes at South Arm Road and Route 4 to find pickup trucks with their tailgates down, holding coolers of food and drink for hikers. At South Arm, the beverages included beer and the trail angel even provided lawn chairs for the weary travelers. Of course, the hikers were a captive audience for the angel and had to endure endless stories about his own hikes, but that seemed a small price to pay for his kindness.        At Pine Ellis, a young couple who were taking a zero day decided to ride out to a road crossing to provide hikers who weren’t going into Andover with treats. During my breakfast at the Little Red Hen in town, an area resident walked up and handed me that day’s local paper. It was a small gesture, but greatly appreciated, since I’m a retired journalist and was hungry for news I had been missing.        Dana and I had been told that a trail angel had left a box of wine and a container of brownies at the shelter near West Carry Pond. Sure enough, those goodies were there, and early that evening a couple arrived in boat with a case of beer for those at the campsite, who included thru hikers and a group of college kids out for freshman orientation.        In Stratton, we were disappointed to learn that the only breakfast place within walking distance of our motel was closed the mornings we were in town. But one morning Sue, the motel owner and a former thru hiker, let us take an old SUV she owns to a café a few miles down the road. A fellow hiker from the motel’s bunkhouse joined us.        As dark descended on Stratton one night, and with Isaac’s rain about to move in, one hiker wasn’t having any luck hitchhiking back to the trail. There just wasn’t much traffic. Then, an older woman driving an otherwise empty school bus picked him up, to the cheers of hikers sitting at the picnic table outside the motel.        All this trail magic wasn’t lost on me, and I ended up paying it forward, as so many others do. Driving to meet Dana at the trailhead on Route 4 in Rangeley, where I would leave my car for a week, I spotted three Germans I had met in Andover, hitchhiking to Rangeley, about 9 miles away. I was early and there was plenty of room in my car for the Germans and their packs, so I turned around and took them to town.         If only all people would treat each other like hikers and people who support them do, the world would be a better place.         Trail droppings        While Dana and I were doing laundry in Stratton, we were forced to go out to dinner in whatever was left in our packs. Dana wore gym shorts, a T-shirt and Crocs with socks. My attire included long john bottoms, a T-shirt and Crocs with no socks. And you know what? The locals didn’t bat an eye at the two dorks. They see a lot of this. Indeed, the guy who drove to breakfast with us in Stratton wore a borrowed tank top and short gym shorts while his clothes were in the wash.        Somewhere, either at home or at Pine Ellis, a mouse or mice got into the tote bags holding my food, which I didn’t discover until we were in Caratunk, where I noticed holes in the baggies holding my gorp and in the wrappers of my energy bars. A bag of extra food remained in my car, which was a week’s hike away in Rangeley. I feared the critter(s) would die of the heat while we were gone, and that we’d find a horrible stench when we opened the car doors. There was no stink but there were droppings all over the dashboard and floor mats. Attempts to trap the varmint(s) in Caratunk and at home were unsuccessful, so I assume it/they escaped when I left the doors of the car open.        Since the diner near the hostel in Stratton was closed, some hikers ordered pizza for breakfast from the nearby convenience store/deli. An employee of the store walked the pies over to the bunkhouse.        At the Looney Moose Café in Stratton, where we drove for breakfast, the locals were discussing a court order for the government to pay for a prison inmate’s sex change. “I don’t know why the government should pay for a sex change,” said Stratton Motel owner Sue. “Why don’t they just buy him a dress? It will be cheaper.”`                                                ","Caratunk, Maine

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/418266,"        
        It’s May 19, and I’m walking alone, far from home, on a dank, misty, foggy morning. Is this any way for a man to spend his 63rd birthday?
        Hell, yeah.
I’m in New Jersey, finishing up another chunk of the Appalachian Trail, a quest I began when I turned 50. And I won’t be alone for long. When I camp, I’ll be joined by other section hikers, as well as the first of the year’s thru hikers making their way north from Georgia. In a few days, when I finish the 43 miles I need to complete Jersey, Dana “Pilot” Perry, the AMC Worcester Chapter’s hiking chair, will pick me up and we’ll head to Pennsylvania to knock off 135 miles in the state known as that rocky place where boots go to die. 
        Though we section hiked separately until joining up last year, Pilot and I have now hiked from Caratunk in Maine to Caledonia State Park in Pennsylvania, about half of the 2,180-mile AT. (Pilot also did a 30-mile stretch in Georgia during a break on a business trip.) The plan is to knock off the rest of the south as soon as possible, then finish with the Hundred Mile Wilderness and Mt. Katahdin in Maine.
        Each section hike is its own adventure with its own character, and this one proved no different except that we were on the trail long enough – two weeks, in my case – to settle into the subculture of long distance hikers out there, joining a band of brothers and a few sisters on their long, sweaty, hungry march north.
        As always, we met fellow trekkers we knew only by their trail names: SnowFrog, Papaw, Bright Side, Taco, Rooster, Woodrow, Darth Vader and his son, Dog Whisperer, to name a few. (Vader and Whisperer, who are from Tennessee, have been section hiking the AT for 13 years, beginning when Whisperer was 15.)
        As always, we experienced, performed or heard about trail magic. On Memorial Day, for example, a family with a vacation home near the trail invited thru hikers down for burgers and beer, and even let them sleep on the porch after the feast. Pilot and his sister, Jennifer, who joined us and fed us like kings while we slack-packed out of Pine Grove Furnace State Park, invited two thru hikers to eat at our cabin, then brought ice cream to others staying in the hostel across the road.
(Pine Grove Furnace is where hikers traditionally take the half-gallon challenge – to finish a half-gallon of ice cream in a sitting – but the general store was closed. So Dana, who drove some hikers to town for supplies, picked up ice cream, enabling those in the hostel to at least have a taste of the tradition, if not the full gut-busting, possibly retching, experience of overindulging.)
        And as always, we stayed at some fascinating places. Just about everywhere that there’s water along the trail in Pennsylvania, there are campsites. We spent one pleasant evening tenting on a peninsula on Clark’s Creek with SnowFrog, Papaw, Darth Vader and Dog Whisperer. The next day we trudged through the rain to the brand new Rausch Gap Shelter, where we slept shoulder to shoulder with the same crew, minus Papaw but plus Bright Side – a recent college grad hiking by herself – while wet gear hung everywhere and never came remotely close to drying. (There’s nothing quite like slipping into cold, wet shorts and boots in the morning.)
        While we had been warned that camping at the site next to the railroad tracks outside Boiling Springs might not be a good idea, Pilot and I ended up there anyway. For three hours or so, no trains passed, and I began to think this might not be so bad. But starting just before dark and continuing at least every hour throughout the very long night, trains thundered and screeched past, less than 100 yards from where we lay in our tents. Since we couldn’t sleep anyway, should we have amused ourselves by mooning the trains, as thru hikers do to the cog railway on Mt. Washington? At one point, I cracked to Pilot that one of the trains might stop, Tom Hanks will get out and take us to the North Pole.
        We also spent a night at the 501 Shelter, named for its proximity to Route 501, an enclosed cabin with bunks, picnic tables inside and out, a hexagon-shaped skylight, two resident cats to keep the mice in check, a porta-potty and a solar-heated (warmed, really) shower outside. For hikers used to far more Spartan accommodations in three-sided shelters deep in the woods, this was the Taj Mahal. 
        The Doyle Hotel in Duncannon, on the other hand, is no Taj Mahal. Apparently never undergoing maintenance or health and safety inspections in the century since it was built, The Doyle, a.k.a. Bed, Bugs & Beyond, nevertheless remains an icon on the AT, a must-stop for hikers. Its bar is lively and well-stocked, and its sandwiches and other simple meals are as good as any pub fare. But the rooms, at $25 a person, are shabby – we slept in our sleeping bag liners instead of trusting their sheets – and the bathrooms are beyond disgusting, with ceiling tiles missing or falling down, linoleum torn up and, I’m told, water from one bathroom leaking into the shower of the one below. (A hiker I met before our stay said he could only hope that leak was shower water.) Still, we had a good time at The Doyle, and I’m glad we stayed there. The AT is not all spit and polish, after all.
        Pennsylvania gets a bad rap from many of the northbounders who pass through, mostly because of the boulder fields north of Port Clinton. But Pilot and I found that the infamous rocks did not live up to the hype. After all, we're from New England, where rocks were invented.(While his boots didn’t die there, for the second straight year his Keens were fatally injured, and he put them out of their misery upon his return home – meaning, they went right into the trash.)
        Pennsylvania does not have the sweeping, mountainous vistas of the Whites or the Bigelows, and when I got home someone asked if hiking there was boring. Not at all. The state has forest floors covered with bright green ferns and stretches of trail lined with flowering mountain laurel and rhododendrons. Look even more closely and you’ll see newts, rocks overturned by bears digging for grubs and spider webs glistening with drops of morning dew. Stepping out of the woods and into the seemingly endless farm fields of the Cumberland Valley, I felt for the first time in 1,000 miles of AT hiking that I was seeing another part of the country.
        I’m looking forward to seeing much more of the country next year, when we head south into Maryland, West Virginia and beyond.
        Postscript: I began my hike by slackpacking out of the Mohican Outdoor Center, where, coincidentally, AMC chapter leaders – including those from Worcester – had gathered for their annual retreat. Our leaders are a devoted, hard-working bunch. They obviously also know how to enjoy themselves after taking care of business.

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476772,"This trip, from Luray, Va., to Caledonia State Park, Pa., was supposed to take us two weeks, but was cut short by Pilot's knee problem. After Pilot gutted it out for five days with a worsening knee, not to mention blistered feet and a beat up big toe, we quit hiking after five days, and Pilot told Wing Man not to make the trip to join us for the final week.
The hike that did in Pilot's knee occurred on Day 3, when we covered 19 miles in Virginia. Not that we planned it that way. After arriving at our intended camp site at 2:30, we decided to press on, confident that we'd find a good place to stealth camp after putting in a few more miles. That didn't happen. (Now we often joke that you only see good places to stealth camp in the morning, when you don't need one. After 4, when you're desperate to call it a day, you're always surrounded by steep slopes, thick brush and/or jumbles of rock where you couldn't possibly pitch a tent.)
We finally camped at the Myron Glaser Cabin, which was locked but had a deck where we slept, a picnic table, even a swing. Strangely, the door to the privy was padlocked, probably the reason the back of the outhouse was littered with poop and paper.
Even though it was cut short, the hike had lots of good moments, including the first day when we stopped at Elk Wallow Wayside on Skyline Drive. There we had lunch and, for 69 cents, I bought a Miller High Life, which I hauled to the Gravel Springs shelter and tent site for happy hour. Hikers staying in the shelter said a bear passed nearby, though we didn't see it.
On Day 2, I turned 64, and while I couldn't celebrate with loved ones back home, it was still a nice way to spend my birthday. There were views from the ridges and lots of pretty wildflowers, including trillium and wild geranium, as well as a scarlet tanager, turkey vulture, bluebird, pileated woodpecker and gold finches.
On Day 4, we landed at Bear's Den Hostel after 11 difficult miles, some in the infamous Roller Coaster. On consecutive nights, I met the hostel challenge by eating a whole pizza and a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.
Some random thoughts on the hike: I'm interested in how people choose, or are bestowed, trail names. We met a thru hiker called Flossie at Bear's Den, and she got her name because she flossed her teeth so often she kept a piece of floss hanging from her pack. ... I always crave food I can't have on the trail, stuff like fresh fruit, veggies, burgers, fries, onion rings and, especially potato chips and beer.","Thornton Gap, Va.

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476785,"Pilot and I returned to the area for some unfinished business: to complete the hike back to Caledonia State Park, Pa. We got about halfway there from Thornton Gap, in Virginia, in the spring when we had to stop hiking because Pilot's knee gave him such problems.
This time, we made it, though we slack packed most of it and had a couple very short days. We spent three nights at Burgundy Lane Bed & Breakfast in Waynesboro, Pa., and two at the Tea Horse Hostel in Harper's Ferry, W. Va.
Pilot and I managed to keep our long streak of hiking without rain gear alive, but not because the weather cooperated. Indeed, on Wednesday, there was torrential rain. But we were slack packing less than six miles to the Tea Horse, where we could get into fresh clothes and wash and dry what we wore hiking. We felt bad for a SOBO couple who had to go 23 miles from Harper's Ferry to Bear's Den Hostel in Virginia. (They didn't wear rain gear, either. It was 70 degrees and, one way or another, you were going to get wet.) We also saw a miserable looking hikers' camp just south of the Shenandoah River and a group taking shelter from the deluge under the bridge that spans the river.
We only spent one night in the woods, camping on tent pads near the Ensign Cowall Shelter. Originally, we had planned to stay near Annapolis Rocks, where we ate lunch and saw college kids climbing. But we got there too early in the day, and decided to push on to the shelter.
Highlights of this trip included the steeply angled Chimney Rocks, which surround a deep opening; Tumbling Run Shelters, which have snoring and non-snoring quarters, a pavilion, bear pole, even a clothesline; the Ed Garvey Shelter, a nice place on ridge that features a loft with plexiglass windows, but also hordes of stink bugs - at least when we stopped for lunch; Weverton Cliff, with its fantastic view of the Potomac River; and the tow path along the C&O Canal. The stagnant canal is covered with algae, as are turtles that live there. We saw several scurry off logs where they were resting into the slime as we hiked past.
Thoughts on the hike: Maryland has just enough rocks on the trail to remind you that you're near Pennsylvania. ... We always see nice places to camp or fabulous shelters when we're not looking for a place to stay. ... We crossed the Mason-Dixon Line on this hike, but never heard anyone south of it pronounce the trail Appa-latch-ian. ... It was nice to be part of a sparking cider toast to SOBOs finishing at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harper's Ferry. ... After this hike, we have five states to finish: Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Maine.","Keys Gap, W. Va.

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500710,"We were surrounded by bears. Everyone was seeing them. Except us.
Pilot and I hiked 145 miles, spending the better part of two weeks in bear country, but didn't see a single one.
Fellow backpackers would arrive in camp, following the same trail we just walked, and announce that they had just spotted a bear. A day hiker told us he saw one just minutes after leaving a parking lot along Skyline Drive.
But that's the way it goes sometimes. Still, we did see our share of wildlife on this trip, including several deer, two rattlesnakes, a couple nasty looking wolf spiders, a blue bird and an indigo bunting. At Black Rock Hut, we couldn't see the whip-poor-wills, but their non-stop calling kept us up all night.
The wolf spiders were clinging to the ceiling of the shelter on Calf Mountain. (Hikers also saw rat snakes in the rafters.) According to Pilot, wolf spiders don't spin webs and wait for dinner to come to them. They go hunting for their meals. And that was apparently the case at this shelter. The morning after our visit, a woman who was hiking as part of the Warrior Project told us a spider crawled over her during the night, prompting her to decide to tent for the rest of her trip.
The Warriors were among several interesting people we met on this section hike, which put us well past the halfway point of completing the AT. Last year, I had heard that another group of Warriors were on the trail, and thought I might interview them for a magazine or newspaper story, especially if I ran into one from Central Massachusetts. But they were a ways behind us on the trail, and we never did see them.
This year, I thought I had my chance, but then the woman who was so traumatized by the spiders told us how the former soldiers are besieged my media when they go into trail towns, so I decided leave them alone to ""walk off the war."" I think the Warrior Project is a great way for veterans to help deal with the trauma of serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At Three Springs Hostel in Vesuvius, Va., where we stayed at the beginning and at the end of our trip, we met Irish, a 68-year-old native of (you guessed it) Ireland, who was thru hiking the AT for the second time. Besides the AT, he had completed the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails, and survived (obviously) nearly get swept away during a river crossing on one of his hikes out west. On this AT hike, Irish had fallen in with Yogi, who lived near him in New York City, though they hadn't known each other until meeting on the AT. We later learned that Irish got off the trail in Waynesboro and headed home so his doctor could check out his aching hip.
Irish had one of the more memorable quotes we heard on our trip. Talking about food, as long-distance hikers so often do, he said one thru hiker out west carried a Denny's menu, which he called hiker porn. ""Hey, Irish, you want a peek?"" Irish recalled him saying.
On the topic of great quotes, thru hiker Piston, from New Brunswick, had one of his own. (At least I think it was an original.) Finding the state hillier than he expected, he said, ""I think the guy who told me Virginia was flat must have been talking about his wife."" 
Ronfather, a recently divorced cage fighter (who looked the part), also came out with a good one: ""Everybody's cool here, but once you get off the trail, assholes pop up everywhere.""
And Wingman, who joined us for the last week of our trip, had a witty observation himself, though I'm not sure exactly how he worded it. Upon seeing a pile of scat in the trail, he said that settled the age-old question of whether bears shit in the woods.
We also ran into Seeker several times on this trip. At 63, she was thru-hiking the AT for the second time, on the fifth anniversary of the year she first completed the trail.
Seeker did not set out to thru-hike the AT that first time. Rather, she had planned to hike the trail for a month, which she thought would give her a mental toughness edge in triathlons. A national class competitor in her age group, she had been training to qualify for international competition. But after a month on the trail, she called her coach to say she was giving up her passion for the triathlon to pursue something else - thru-hiking the AT.
Though we never met him, Dave the Naturalist was another character in this stretch of the AT. He had left several jugs of tap water at one point on the trail, along with a sign that said what municipal supply it had come from and identified the person who left it. That would be Dave the Naturalist.
Seeker told us she ran into Dave on the trail and had a pleasant conversation with him, even though he hikes wearing just boots and a hat. Apparently, Dave is a naturalist who walks the walk.
We found this stretch of the AT to be one of the easier sections so far. While there were testy climbs, rocks and roots, for sure, much of the trail was a dirt path over gentle terrain. We could see how thru-hikers knock off big mileage in Shenandoah.
One of them, Weed Eater, hiked 30 miles one day, and began the next by doing push-ups before setting out on the trail.
Interestingly, we did not experience any trail magic on this trip. No coolers with beer or food left along the trail. No one serving refreshments at road crossings. No signs directing hikers to free cookouts at nearby homes.
However, we were treated very well, starting with Oma and Marsha (not sure of spelling), the owners of Three Springs Hostel. They treated us and other guests like family, making us feel very comfortable at the hostel, which is on a small farm in the middle of nowhere and has been open for a year and a half.
And I can't say enough about the shuttle service that brings hikers from the trailhead into Waynesboro. There are about a dozen people to call for a ride, and they refuse to accept money for gas or even tips. It's just part of the hospitality the town extends to AT hikers. Plus, I had a very good experience with the Augusta urgent care center in town, where I was treated for an infected elbow. In and out within an hour, unlike a hospital emergency room, where you might spend half a day waiting to be seen.
We traversed our first grassy bald on this trip, Cold Mountain, where besides having a great view in the distance we spotted a blue bird up close.Mountain laurel and rhododendrons were in beautiful bloom, sometimes creating tunnels to walk through. We also saw a rare yellow lady's slipper, trillium, wild geraniums, what looked like wild azaleas, May apples and lots of small blue, purple or white flowers that we couldn't identify. Late May and early June is a pretty time to be hiking in Shenandoah.Speaking of plant life, on the way to Black Rock Hut we passed the penis tree, where a drooping, rotted off limb resembles, well, a penis. We just had to stop for photos.
You couldn't help but notice how the invasive kudzu has covered so much ground, climbed and killed so many trees along the roadside in Virginia. Fortunately, there didn't seem to be much kudzu in the park - yet.
On every trip, I look for trends, and on this one I noticed several.
Most noticeably, there were as many women thru hiking as men, many by themselves. On past trips, hammocks were a novelty, but not any more. Many thru hikers used them, and those I questioned said they were comfortable. (Ever the skeptic, I don't thinking sleeping in a U shape looks comfortable.) If there was a dominant water filter, it was a small Sawyer, which users can squeeze water through or hang to let gravity do the work. Wingman bought one in Waynesboro and liked it very much.
And just about all the people going a long way, whether thru hikers or section hikers, were wearing trail running shoes instead of boots. Distance hikers say trail runners are lighter, more comfortable, grippier on rocks, quicker to dry and cheaper. I wore my trail runners for the first two days on the trail, when we were slack packing, and found them so comfortable I wore them for the entire trip. The only downside was that mine are lined with Gore-Tex, which failed to keep my feet dry and made the shoes much slower to dry than non-lined shoes.
This trip, a 10-hour drive at least, was probably the last to the south on which we will drive. Next time out, we will fly, perhaps to Georgia, and begin sectioning to Punchbowl Mountain. But first, the plan is to hike the 30 miles from the Kennebec River to Monson, in Maine, which will leave just the 100-Mile Wilderness to finish in the north.
Now that I'm 65, I appreciate more than ever that I'm able to do things like run, ski and bike, and especially hike the Appalachian Trail. Not that my demise is imminent, but I feel like the curtain has risen on Act III of a three-act play, and I want to make the most of my fitness for as long as I can.","Punchbowl Mountain

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531130,"                       “I’m a redneck, not a hillbilly,” Joe Mitchell said before elaborating. “Hillbillies are dumb, but rednecks are smart.”        Welcome to Mitchell’s world, the Four Pines Hostel just off the Appalachian Trail near the town of Catawba in southwest Virginia, where Dana “Pilot” Perry and I spent a day and night during our recent 160-mile AT section hike.        A barn at Four Pines flies both the Stars and Stripes and the Confederate flag, and one of Mitchell’s vehicles sports a bumper sticker that reads: Alcohol, tobacco and firearms. Who’s bringing the chips?        While Guinea hens, chickens, a rooster, two dogs and a couple cats roamed the hilly, fenced-in premises, Mitchell drank beer and played the lawn game called corn hole with hikers, most of whom were on their way from Georgia to Maine.        The main sleeping quarters at Four Pines is in a converted three-car garage, which contains a motley assortment of “beds,” including old upholstered sofas and loveseats you might expect to see along the side of the road with a FREE sign. (We opted to pass on the crowded and funky garage to tent in the field, which Mitchell assured me was tick-free, thanks to the Guinea hens. Some of the other guests hung their hammocks in one of the barns.)        Four Pines is one of those quirky, much-talked-about places along the AT. Whatever you think of rednecks, Mitchell is a friendly guy and his is a welcoming place. And you can’t beat the price: whatever you want to donate. Sodas and freeze pops are free, as are rides to the trailhead and a nearby convenience store.        Four Pines was one of three hostels we visited while off trail to resupply and clean up. Others included the Woodshole Hostel near Pearisburg, where a young couple host hikers and work a small farm; and Three Springs Hostel near Buena Vista, a comfortable, homey place we were visiting for the second straight year. We also stayed in a basic motel and at a run-down campground.       And, oh yeah, we did a bit of hiking, too.       This section of the AT had its share of severe ups and downs, including our last climb, Bluff Mountain, a 3,391-footer that we dubbed Mt. Whup Ass because we trudged up on a hot day with no cover from the foliage, which had yet to emerge high on the mountains.       Still, the elevation changes were usually tempered by gradual switchbacks, there were long, easy stretches along ridgelines and we often stopped to admire and photograph the blooming wildflowers, including bleeding hearts, trillium and may apple. The thick jungles of rhododendron, which sometimes form a tunnel around the trail, were just beginning to flower. As we mentioned several times, we were walking into spring, to paraphrase the title of a book written by Earl Shaffer, the first AT thru hiker.       The section featured McAfee Knob, which is one of the most photographed spots on the AT. Everyone poses for a photo on the McAfee outcropping, which I found less scary than Bondcliff in the Whites. The trail also skirts perilously close to the 3,000-foot Tinker Cliffs, across the valley from McAfee. And we passed under the Guillotine, a boulder suspended between two rock slabs near Apple Orchard Mountain, a 4,000-footer; hiked over to the jagged, pointed Dragon’s Tooth rock formation on Cove Mountain; and crossed the James River on the longest footbridge on the AT, appropriately dedicated to William T. Foot.       Once again, we saw no bears, but lots of deer, at times dozens grazing in fields like cattle. We came across one deer that was apparently having a sneezing fit, pawing at its nose trying to get relief. Dana pointed out several eastern towhees, and I spotted a bluebird. At the Woodshole Hostel, one of the bathtubs was taken up by chicks and ducklings the owners were raising. And at Three Springs, co-owner Marcia showed us a resident black snake that naps on a shelf in one of the sheds when it’s not keeping the garden area’s vole population in check.       As beautiful as the scenery and the wildlife can be, often it’s the people we meet who truly make a hiking trip memorable.        This time, we met a couple formerly from Westboro, Cheryl and Kelly Collins, thru hikers who call themselves Wonder and Santa on the trail. Turns out Santa was the high school math teacher of Dana’s older son.Doug Bonacum, a.k.a. NOWA (No One Walks Alone), was on a quest to raise money to fight Alzheimer’s disease, which had claimed his father two years ago. He expected to raise $50,000 on his thru hike. When people donate, NOWA adds the names of their loved ones who died of the disease to a list he carries in his backpack. After he told me his story, I made a modest contribution, and now my mother’s name is among those on the way to Maine.       Several times on this section, we ran into The Spirit of 76, a native of Germany who lived in London and New York before settling in New Orleans, where she makes her living painting and teaching art. She bonded with a young couple, Pant and Zen Master, both art school students who shared the Punchbowl Shelter with us on our last night on the trail. After dinner, Zen pulled out a Japanese tea set, brewed tea and served it to us in tiny porcelain cups.       There was trail magic, as usual. The Captain, who lives just off the AT, offers hikers free sodas, a charging station and camping in his yard. To get there, you take a zipline across the creek. And while nine of us hikers were eating at a restaurant in Daleville, an anonymous patron paid for our first round of beers.       Everyone has stories to tell, and Ghost told one of the best. Ghost lives in Rutland, Vt., and quit his job in midlife to thru hike the AT. Weather permitting, he’s a cowboy camper, sleeping on the ground in the open. Come morning, he’s gone before others even stir in their tents or in the shelters.       He told us that at the end of his very first day on the trail, in Georgia, he met a southbounder who was just one day from finishing the AT. Ghost was eager to learn about the trail, and when the talk turned to food, the seasoned veteran stressed the importance of Snickers bars.       “What’s so special about Snickers?” Ghost wondered.The vet learned toward him and, whispering like he was about to divulge the location of the Holy Grail, said, “Women on the trail will trade sex for Snickers.”       I’d be remiss if I did not give a shout out to Dana for planning this long and complicated trip, which included air travel, a rental car, off-trail stays every few days, shuttles when we slackpacked, food drops, a ride back to the airport and more. I keep telling him that if he ever leaves his job, he could carve out a career planning others’ trips. Right down to the last detail, of course.        
And I'd be remiss if I didn't chastise gear manufacturers for misleading, even false, claims about their waterproof/breathable rain gear. I've had a number of different jackets, all by different manufacturers with proprietary fabrics, and none will keep you dry for very long. I'm surprised the hiking/backpacking community has not raised more of a stink about this.","Pearisburg, Va.

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545135,"                        After having to cancel this 34-mile section in 2014 and 2015, this year proved to be the charm and Pilot and I put it in the books. Now, we have the 100 Mile Wilderness and Katahdin in the north, and from Springer to Pearisburg, Va., in the south, for a total of about 750 miles remaining. The plan is to finish when I’m 70, within four years.        We hiked the section northbound, and on the first day we landed at the Pleasant Pond lean-to and camping area, just 5-plus miles from the trailhead near the Kennebec River. But first, we survived the shuttle from Monson, where we left our car at Lake Shore House, our destination at the end of our hike. The daughter of the hostel owner was behind the wheel, driving on her freshly minted learner’s permit, and she bombed along the Maine back roads while singing to reggae blasting from a speaker mounted on the dash of the Toyota Sienna van. Her mom, who occasionally offered a few driving tips, sat with her bare feet on the dash, also singing and apparently unfazed by the speed at which we were hurtling along the narrow, winding roads.        The hike to Pleasant Pond was nice and easy, a good way to start, but the site was not the idyllic spot we envisioned. The shelter was old and far from the water, and the tent sites were scattered along the grassy trail to the pond.       The privy, in a word, was disgusting. In two words, it was beyond disgusting. It was nearly full, with the pile of shit and paper just inches from the seat and the bare bottom of anyone who dared use it. Judging from all the paper scattered in the area, many people were choosing to squat outside instead.      And while the shelter and camping area seemed secluded, once we got to the pond several hundred yards away we saw summer homes, power boats and docks.       Still, it was home for the night, and we turned in to the call of loons on the water.        Day 2 was much, much tougher. It was hot and humid, and we had to hump more than 13 miles over Pleasant Pond Mountain and Moxie Bald Mountain before reaching the Moxie Bald lean-to and camping area. Northbound and southbound hikers swapped information on water sources, which, in many cases had dried up in the summer’s drought.        Moxie Bald Mountain was particularly beautiful, with views of distant mountains to the northeast and Bald Mountain Pond nearby. And the camping area was more what we expected: no homes, boats or docks, at least not on the AT side of the lake. We swam to cool off and clean up, despite a hiker’s warning of leeches in the water. And we tented within a stone’s throw from the pond, which was really nice.        On Day 3, the terrain was easy but the miles long - about 17, counting the road walk into Monson. Along the way, we rock-hopped sections of the Piscataquis River that we had expected to ford, and, once in town, got a tour of a sporting camp under construction, called 100 Mile Wilderness LLC. When we spotted the place, we thought it might be the new Appalachian Trail Conservancy visitor center. Later in the day, when we stopped at the actual center, the woman on duty said there were issues with the private camp using 100 Mile Wilderness on a road sign, which many found confusing, thinking they were being directed to the trailhead, not a business. Anyway, the camp, a work in progress with cabins, a bunkhouse, showers and a kitchen, seems a pretty cool idea. The place reminds me of AMC’s wilderness cabins and lodges not far away.        Back at Lake Shore House, we drank at the edge of Lake Hebron, then showered and stuffed our faces with dinner at Lake Shore and ice cream at Pete’s Place next door, where we returned the next morning for breakfast before hitting the road home.        ","Caratunk

Greenie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563786,"Our southernmost section hike of the AT, from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Fontana Dam in North Carolina, is in the books. Covering 166 miles, it featured lots of rain, some damaging winds, heartbreaking wildfire damage, two tick bites - one with a bullseye rash, and one prescription for a dose of antibiotic phoned in from Massachusetts.
	What a trip.
	Dana Perry and I have been section hiking for several years now, and I tell people that I can count on one hand the number of times we’ve had to put on our rain gear. Until this trip, when we practically lived in it.
	The first night on the trail, it poured several inches of rain, which saturated the red Georgia clay on the tent pads and seeped through the floor of even the best tents. Those with Walmart tents or cheap hammocks got soaked, and several of those people just left them behind, a gross violation of leave no trace and a real headache for the ridge runners to pack out.
	At a shelter the next night, when it also rained hard, hikers slept shoulder to shoulder and, in our case, with someone stretched across the end of our feet. Still, it was less of a clusterf*** than I expected with all those people and all that wet gear. Everyone just rose to the occasion, cooperating and accommodating one another.
	That night, besides the sound of the rain hammering the shelter’s metal roof, hikers could hear the resident mice climbing the walls. One woman, who had stayed there the night before as well, told us a mouse had climbed into her pack and given birth to a litter of three.
	It rained more days than not, and we ended up taking two extra days off trail, one in a cabin to dry out our tents, another because heavy rain and damaging wind were predicted. We filled the two-bedroom cabin at Neel Gap with hanging, wet gear. Looking at all that stuff, it seemed impossible that it all fit in two backpacks. Taking an extra night at the Nantahala Outdoor Center proved a wise move, as hurricane-force winds took down countless trees along the AT. A bit further north, hikers were turned back and roads were closed in the Smokies, where a wind gust topped 90 mph.
	It was a baptism by fire for some of the hikers, many of whom had little or no backpacking experience and hauled too much gear and too much of the wrong gear. Since our farthest trip south until this one had been in Virginia, we were used to seeing hikers who had already put in hundreds of miles, were fit and knew what to do. Now we know why so many potential thru hikers drop out in Georgia and North Carolina.
Speaking of fire, we walked miles of trail that cut through areas devastated by wildfires. Skeletal remains replaced what would have been tunnels of soon-to-bloom rhododendrons, and the trail was dangerously eroded on many of the steep side hills.
Still, there was evidence of nature’s power to regenerate. Areas that were scorched last year already had wildflowers and ground cover growing out of the blackened earth. But it will take years to recover.
When we were off trail, we stayed at hostels with varying personalities. The nicest was also the most restrictive. Upon arrival, hikers are taken to the mudroom, where they leave everything but the clothes on their backs, medicine, phones and chargers. After showering, they turn over those clothes for laundering and are given sweats to wear during their stay. I even went into town to get my prescription in the dorky striped Adidas outfit I was issued. That said, the owners were friendly and otherwise hospitable. (They even stocked microbrews in the fridge, for a very reasonable $2.50 a pop.) And since they cater to guests other than hikers, we could understand their paranoia about vermin, grime and stink.
	Given the weather and fire damage, you might think Dana and I did not enjoy ourselves, but we actually had a good time. We had to adjust and adapt, and, as on all trips, learned something new.
In my case, I was trying out a new rain jacket. Frustrated with expensive so-called waterproof/breathable jackets that quickly get wet and take forever to dry, I bought a Light Heart Gear jacket that makes no claim to being breathable. It’s coated on one side with polyurethane and on the other with silicone, with ultra-long pit zips for ventilation.
I’m not a big sweater, so I didn’t get very wet inside while hiking and since the fabric cannot wet out, none of the rain penetrated. Once in camp, I was still able to wear it for warmth over my layers, since the jacket did not absorb any water. This system might not work for those who perspire heavily, but I was quite satisfied with it.
A few other tidbits:
Quote of the trip, from a hiker who left the trail with knee problems after a few days: “I’m only afraid of three kinds of snakes: live ones, dead ones and those that look like sticks.”
Trail magic: By sheer coincidence, Dana’s cousin, who lives in New Jersey, and his son were on a car/day hiking trip to the South, and when Dana found out he made plans for them to meet us at a road crossing. He also told them I would be dying for a beer, and they surprised me with a microbrew from Pennsylvania. I drank it at the next campsite, and when I popped the cork stopper, it sounded like I had opened a bottle of champagne. I was ready for any moochers who might want a sip with a quote from another hiking buddy: “If you want a little toot on the trail, you’d better bring your own horn.”
We see lots of people backpacking with their dogs, but this trip was the first in which someone had a puppy. The 10-lb. basset/beagle mix was the cutest dog I’ve ever seen, though the trail is no place for a pup.
One hostel gave hikers hospital scrubs to wear while their clothes were in the laundry. Some even wore them to town for dinner. When they got out of the shuttle van, it looked like the inmates had been let out of the asylum.
We were usually above 3,000 feet, often over 4,000 feet and occasionally at 5,000. But much of the trail is routed along the sides of steep mountains, switchbacks are used liberally and most of the trail is on dirt. So the hiking was challenging, but not White Mountains-hard.
We saw a little Yankee ingenuity in the Deep South. At several water sources, a resourceful type had placed a rhododendron leaf to create a small chute, making it easier for water to flow into a bottle.
Terrain features had some colorful names. A few of my favorites: Pickens Nose, Big Butt, Hogpen Gap and Swinging Lick Gap.
And finally, speaking of names, and in case it ever comes up at an AMC cocktail party, is the 30-mile point Neel Gap, Neel’s Gap or Neels Gap? My map says Neel, while other sources have it as Neel’s or Neels. But as one commenter put it on whiteblaze.net, “Tell one person to meet you at Neel Gap, another person to meet you at Neel’s Gap and both will go to the same place.” Well said.","
