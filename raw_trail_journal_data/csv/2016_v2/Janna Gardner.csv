Janna Gardner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518495,"A year and a half ago, mostly by accident, I read Bill Bryson's ""A Walk In The Woods"". That ignited a spark that led to reading a dozen or more accounts from thru hikers on the A.T. Gradually I started to think why couldn't I do this. Last Dec. I asked my husband for a backpack for Christmas. He said ""You hiking somewhere?"" ""As a matter of fact I am"" and told him of my idea to hike the A.T. After he quit laughing he agreed to follow in our RV as my support person. Gotta love the man! We've done some hiking in our travels but only day trips. So the research and planning began. Never would I have imagined all that's involved in a thru hike. Last May I did my first overnight hike in Yosemite with a friend. We camped in a backpackers campground and climbed Half Dome the next morning. Cross that off my bucket list!!! Half Dome was beautiful but the hike was hard and that was only two days of hiking. Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained. So, the training begins.",,Maine,"Dec 16, Wed",0
Janna Gardner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518496,"I'm planning to start my nobo hike March 30,2016. Knowing that I will encounter cold weather and likely snow I'm testing my tent and sleeping bag outside tonight. It's supposed to get to below freezing.",,Maine,"Dec 17, Thu",0
Janna Gardner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518497,The cold test went well. The fleece liner in my down bag made a big difference. Will swap it out for a lighter one when the weather warms up. Didn't need any extra layers just the mid weight base layers and socks for sleeping. I normally sleep very warm no extra covers needed at home. I was afraid I should have bought a warmer bag but mine seems okay. Need to start practicing packing my backpack and eliminating excess weight.,,Maine,"Dec 18, Fri",0
Janna Gardner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519209,Getting serious about the food planning. Tried dehydrating some canned chicken but it was still crunchy upon rehydrating. Plan mostly to use the freezer bag cooking style to avoid long cooking times. Think freeze dried chicken may be a better option. Will put together a few days of meals to get an idea of weight.I've been collecting recipes and ideas. Taste tasting ahead of time has eliminated some recipes and modified others.I welcome all ideas and suggestions. Starting to count down the days but it still doesn't seem quite real!,,Maine,"Jan 06, Wed",0
Janna Gardner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520192,Been watching all the news about the blizzard back East. Looks like tons of snow on the AT. I know its likely I'll have some snow but not prepared for what they have now! Praying that the weather will improve ( a lot!!!!) before I start in two months. Working mostly right now on meal planning and dehydrating. Hiking local trails with my pack ( adding weight gradually ) about twice a week.,,Weather watching!,"Jan 25, Mon",0
Janna Gardner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522595,On the road ! Georgia or bust! Counting down the days to the start on March 30th. First major stop was Death Valley. Got to Dallas last night. Visiting with friends for a few days. Saw the remnants of the tornado that came thru Garland TX. Give me an earthquake anyday.,"Weather watching!

Janna Gardner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524102,"11 days and counting. Made it to Florida from California! My hike starts on March 30th. I'm nervous and excited. Second guessing many of my equipment choices but it is what it is. The trail will tell. Will get to Georgia on the 28th with time to visit the park, sign in and ready my pack. Meeting my hiking partner for breakfast on the 29th, it will be good to have company on this adventure. Wish us luck !","

Janna Gardner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525375,"Tomorrow is the big day! I am officially hiker #1102. Weighed my pack after registering at Amicalola State Park, 37 lbs! Time for a major review of my gear. Under 35 lbs would be a good start. Met my hiking partner for the first time at breakfast today. Connected through trailjournals! Two mature ladies (Ha!) from opposite coasts starting the trail at the same time. It will be good to have the company.Included a few photos from today. Wish us luck.","

3/30-First day! Hiked to Hawk Mt campground. Pitched my tent. No bears! My pack weighs about 35 lbs. 9+ miles. Feeling good.
3/31-   Rained like crazy. Hiked soaking wet up Sassafras Mt. Pitched tent in the rain. Bedtime 8 pm. Hard day!
4/1- Rain stopped. More hiking. Staying at Gooch Gap shelter. Mile 15.8
4/2- It was nice to stay in the shelter(no tent set up and a privy), but noisy! Will probably just set up my tent near the shelter if not stormy. Hiked from Gooch to Woody Gap. First trail magic today. Dr. Pepper and Lil Bit (trail names) Trail magic at Woody Gap by the ""Twelve Tribes"" Google for more info. I heard the word cult mentioned by it was a great free lunch and no one tried to recruit me. Maybe I'm too old! Staying at Blood Mt. cabins at Neel Gap tonight. Did laundry and went to Mountain Crossings (outfitter) for a pack shakedown. They try to get your pack weight done by eliminating the unnecessary. Also willing to sell you new gear. Zero miles day.
4/4- Got a shuttle back to Woody Gap where we left the trail. Hiked to Lance Creek.This is the last place you can camp without a hard sided bear canister until after Neel Gap. Weather was beautiful today and the trail easier. Waiting for it to get dark so I can go to bed (hikers midnight). Mile 24.3","
