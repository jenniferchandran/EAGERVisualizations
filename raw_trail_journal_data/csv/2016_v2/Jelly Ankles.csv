Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520952,"I will be updating this blog throughout the 100 days that I will be hiking the Appalachian Trail. I hope to add to it regularly, although I can not make any promises because I imagine I will be a bit distracted at times. There are 10 more days before Cheetah (Ria's trail name!) and I are dropped off in Amicalola Falls State Park. The anxiety of preparation has set in and I feel more frantic every day. Today, I cut off all of the tags on my gear, hopeful that at least a tenth of an ounce has been shaved off my weight. Ironically, i proceeded to sew a small St. Christopher charm to my pack, surely negating any of the weight I thought i was saving by cutting off tags. Oh well, I would rather have the weight of St. Christopher than any of those tags (thank you Donnellys)!!There are many tasks I have left to prepare before we depart...last minute gear needs to be bought. Most of these items can be purchased from Wal-Mart (moleskin, leukotape, trash compactor bags, antiseptic towlettes, etc). Gear to be ordered...gaiters, go pro, sleeping bag liner, storm matches. Besides gear, I will also be preparing my bounce box and meal drops. Food desperately needs to be bought. Logistics are also important, however, Cheetah and I have not set mileage goals for each day of the first week. It is a large weight off our shoulders to not care where we end at the 100 day mark. Our journey feels less technical, more emotional. Not sure who will be following this trail blog but wanted to include a link for those of you that are interested in our location throughout the hike. I will be carrying a Spot GPS which will regularly update our progress along the way. Please feel free to save this link to your browser and share with whomever you please. http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=09TshVGE1JbznAVNVzJ7qO7qGRJBeze6C","

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521486,"Cheetah and I are currently being chauffeured by my amazing parents down to our drop off point of Amicalola Falls State Park in northern Georgia. We are staying in the state park lodge tonight and tomorrow night and then embarking from the Springer Mountain trailhead Monday morning. Tomorrow we will spend our day hiking around Amicalola Falls and orienting ourselves to trail life. Both of our packs weigh in around 30lbs, by Neels Gap (day 3) we will stop at an outfitter that offers free pack shakedowns which will hopefully shave off some weight.

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521872,"I plan on transferring most of my daily journal entries to this blog in order to be more efficient with my time. These are the thoughts in my head at the end of each night. Please be aware that I write a lot each night so I will separate the longer passages into individual blog posts. Here is Day One.Day One - Springer Mtn to Hawk Mtn ShelterThis morning Ria and I were picked up by Ron Brown from The Lodge at Amicalola Falls. He has been shuttling thru-hikers for ten years and he makes his living from this job. We gave him $30 a piece. He picked us up in a muddy ForeRunner Toyota covered in AT bumper stickers. On the inside was a GPS that used the same voice as the guy that sings ""The Monster Mash."" The GPS's name was ""Mr. Nightmare."" Also inside was another thru-hiker named Maniac-Cole. He was a talker and a little rough around the edges. Also a smoker and very nice, he mentioned that he would like to quit smoking while on the trail. We drove on a dirt road out to the Springer trail-head, took about an hour. Ron gave us an immense amount of knowledge about the trail. Turns out he is an avid trail angel. Daily he leaves 6 gallons of water at Cooper Gap, which is in the middle of a 7 mile stretch with no water. He has never thru-hiked but is from NH so he has done a bit inter White Mtns and then of course he has also hiked a bit in GA and NC.Ron dropped myself and Ria off at the 0.9 mile mark of the AT so we hiked the 9 tenths we missed up to the start of Springer Mtn then turned around and officially began our hike from there (which meant re-hiking the 9 tenths down the Mtn). On top of Springer we met and older man named Sojo and his golden retriever, Theo. He was around 70 years old and told us that Theo is 10. We played cat and mouse with him until mile 4 and then our pace overpowered his. At the 1 mile mark we met our first true trail friend, Ultra. His trail name is Ultra because he runs ultra marathons (more than 26.2 miles). He told us that he played baseball in the Marlins organization for a while but now he is a special education teacher for elementary students. The school is in Lebanon, Indiana. He has a son who is a freshman in high school and a daughter who is a freshman at Franklin College. We stayed around him til around mile 5 when Ria and I stopped to have lunch. We took our shoes off and let our feet rest and air out. Had a couple hot spots but nothing serious. It seems that my little and big toes are the problem areas. I are pita bread with peanut butter, a snickers bar and I think that's it. From there Ria and I hit a small wall. My legs and hips were exhausted even though my feet felt much better. We passed by the first shelter where Maniac Cole was staying around 11am and moved on, it was too early to stop. For the next five miles the weather was favorable (although thunder in the distance), and the scenery was beautiful. Plenty of Mtn Laurel and Georgia Pines all with a strip of GA red clay as the trail. At mile 7.4 it started pouring...and hailing. We had less than a mile to Hawk Mtn shelter but I got drenched bc I was not wearing rain pants or my raincoat. Thanks to this horrible judgment call on my part my only sports bra, my buff, underwear, shirt, hat and legging are so wet I was able to wring water out of them. Also, Ria and I were so overwhelmed when we got to camp and it seemed like the shelter was full (seemed key word here) so we decided it was a good idea to immediately set our tents up...in the downpour. Therefore, the inside of our tents got wet in the pitching process. We should have waited for the rain to die down in the shelter and THEN pitch our tents. There are probably 20 ppl staying at this location which is way more than I expected.We ran into Ultra who had arrived an hour before us. He was shivering and not optimistic about the rain. He said he does not have a sleeping pad and his tent leaks so I am worried he won't get a good nights sleep. We sat around the campfire in the rain (which Ria faithfully tended to) til around 6pm then it became too dark and cold and was still raining steadily. I don't think I will be eating a big meal tonight or even brushing my teeth. I am in the tent for good until morning. Then we plan on taking all of our things to the shelter and taking our time to dry it all out and reorganize. Maybe have some warm tea. Oh! And my trail name is Jelly Ankles because I rolled my ankles so much this morning that Ria said they are like Jelly! Good day!","Hawk Mountain Shelter
",Hawk Mountain Shelter,"Feb 25, Thu",9.20
Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521926,"Day 2 - Hawk Mtn Shelter to Gooch Mountain ShelterToday was a hard day. Rain allllll night, mouse chewed through my tent, then cold rain in wet cold clothes. Ultra was with us until Sassafrass Mtn and then he fell behind and we haven't seen him since. My tent bottom was soaking wet from putting it up in the pouring rain. Being on the trail makes me realize how well prepared Ria and I are. Gear-wise but also we are able to take on the terrain more so than other people we thought were in great shape. Short but steep climb up Sassafrass then longer climb up Justus Mtn. Down for a long time into greenery. Level terrain and then gentle uphill til shelter. 7.7 miles that felt like 25. It's around 6pm but still no sign of Ultra or our other friend Emily. Ria and I are a little worried about them. Sinatra (another new friend) has been a fun guy to be around. He is from NJ and sounds just like Sinatra. He wears indoor soccer shoes to hike in, brought a 5 person outdoor shower, 6 books to read, 4 pairs of shoes, among other things. He gave away all of his water before a 7 mile really tough stretch and still rolled on past Ria and I even though he started an hour and a half after us. Thunderstorms all day tomorrow with Blood Mtn... Which is 9 miles uphill and grueling after about 2 miles. My body is really fatigued, especially my hips and shoulder but we are trying to make it to Neel Gap which is 15 miles from here. Ria and I are staying in Gooch Gap Shelter with around 12 other people. Hopefully not many mice. I did hang up my food bag tonight so that's good. Tonight we met Turtle (a Knoxville, TN computer engineer who grew up in Dayton). He only has one pair of shoes and uses an umbrella instead of rain gear so hopefully he doesn't get too cold. We also talked to a guy from Chicago who has already hiked the AT once and the PCT. He is planning on hiking as much as possible until May when he leaves for the PCT again. He gave us a lot of good tips, especially on shoes... need a pinching heel to keep foot from sliding forward and causing blisters on downhill. He said he didn't feel in shape on the AT until week 8. Sinatra and a fellow named Spaceman went off down the trail to try and find Emily who I bet set up camp. Had fettuccine Alfredo, cheese and crackers, and snickers for dinner which was tasty. Put too much water in the pot so I kind of messed up the Alfredo but it still tastes good. There is a guy named Gator from Miami who is sleeping on the direct surface of the shelter and is already thinking about quitting. He has been asking for snacks and does not have a sleeping bag or even a blanket. Sinatra gave Gator half of a zebra blanket, so nice. It is getting colder and is supposed to start raining at 10pm. Hopefully our bodies our bodies are ready to put in some work tomorrow. Also, blisters have popped up on my pinky toes and arches because I didn't wear my hiking liners today. They are currently hanging on a line to dry right now and I hope they actually do because I need them to make it through tomorrow. Need a positive attitude.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521930,"Day Three - Gooch Mountain Shelter to Woods Hole ShelterCrazy day. Started out beautiful but then the rain and the snow came through. We found out what happened to Emily. Poor girl... she hiked 12 hours and wasn't able to make it to Gooch shelter. She ended up hiking in the dark til 11pm and stopped by a stream 3 tenths of a mile from the shelter. She ended up wrapping herself in a tarp by a stream after falling in it. It eventually washed her water filter away...she has had to drink unfiltered water until now. She ended up going into town (Suches, GA)...seriously has the best attitude of anyone I've ever met. She walked into Gooch this morning smiling. I would have been in tears. Right now I am so so so cold. We are 3 miles away from Neel Gap but we were so tired, wet, and cold that we headed to the shelter...thank god we are in the shelter because lots of people showed up after us and are having to tent camp. Started snowing sideways, down to 6 degrees tonight. Day Four - Woods Hole Shelter to Neel Gap/Blood Mtn CabinsWoke up this morning pretty discouraged from yesterday's low point. Also, it was about 15 degrees last night with snow and wind blowing into the shelter. My boots were frozen solid. All of my soaking wet clothes from the rain during the day froze into a solid block of ice. Hadn't gone to the bathroom so I was worried about constipation. We started up the last uphill mile of Blood Mtn around 9:25am. Katie (Echo) from NJ and Paul from Pennsylvania joined our group of three (with Turtle). Echo has a really sore knee right now so She was going nice and slow. I stayed with her on the uphill and then pulled away from her on the downhill because I was able to move a bit more. Blood Mtn was absolutely beautiful in the snow and the uphill was not bad at all. My knee wasn't hurti me. So amazing on the summit. Not super clear views but gorgeous with snow all over. There was a shelter from the 30s or 40s right on top that was great. 4 sided and made of stone with a fireplace in the inside. We took some pictures then headed downhill for the next 2 miles. When we began the crazy descent (TONS of ice on vast slabs of rock) very steep. We were eventually passed by a pack of about 15 Army Rangers. They had on packs that weighed about 60lbs, didn't use poles and we're basically running (""racing"" they said). At one point we lost sight of the white blazes marking the trail (covered in snow) and started down a very steep and very dangerous slab of cliff face covered in ice. We saw one of the Rangers head that way so we followed. I was about a quarter of the way down when we realized there wasn't a trail at the end (thanks to Rangers already at bottom). I went back up around the top of the cliff face with Paul and we searched for another blaze or at least a more traveled trail. Thank god we finally did, everyone (including Rangers) came back up and went on our way after drawing arrows in the snow leading in the correct direction. Unfortunately, with every step down my right knee and knee cap was in pain. Ria said its not serious and to rest it and ice/hear it and stretch everyday and it should be fine. Hopefully she is right! The 2 mile downhill took us longer than expected but we made it to Neel Gap around 1:30pm. The people here are awesome. In the front of the outfitters there is a large tree with hundreds of hiker boots hanging from all the branches. They say these are all the boots that hikers didn't/couldn't use anymore. We checked with them about cabins but they only run the bunk room so they were nice enough to call down to the cabin guy for us and there was availability. We left our packs at the Neel Gap Outfitter and walked about 200 yards downhill to the cabin check in. 5 of us split one ($14.30 each) and we raised their freezer of pizzas. Then Ria, Echo, Paul and I went back up to the outfitter and had a free pack shakedown. Sending my book, bowl, packtowel and a couple other items home tomorrow. I will also be purchasing a new raincoat and possibly a new pair of mittens...along with a patch for my pack to sew on. I also need to send Truitt some stickers for his collection: anyway, after about 2 hours we made it back down to the cabin and I immediately cooked my pizza and ate all of it and it was freaking glorious. Then I sent all my laundry off (done for free) and hopped in the shower. We talked and watched movies all night until around 12am. I started dozing off so Ria and I are in the main room with a door. Talked to mom and Truitt today which was so great. I definitely miss everyone. Anyway, we decided to take a zero here tomorrow in the same cabin so hopefully my knee will get back to full force by Saturday. Got hungry again a second ago so I made a pepperoni hot pocket which was soooo tasty. Time for sleep in a REAL bed.

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522371,"Days 5 through 8 - Neel Gap to Whitley Gap Shelter to Poplar Orchard Campground to Blue Mtn ShelterTook a 3 day break from writing so tonight I am playing catch up. After our first night in Neel Gap we decided to stay a second night in Chipmunk Cabin. The day was spent airing out our packs/tents/clothing, etc. We watched tv and I spent a lot of time on my phone attempting to update my blog for Trail Journals. Around 3pm we headed up to the outfitter to purchase a couple gear items, send unused gear home, and hang out with the workers. George (Georgiana) owns the place then there is Matt ""Pretzel,"" Silent Bob and a guy named Jason. They were all super nice and helpful. Pretzel patched my tent for free, George helped me pick out my new rain coat (I'm in love...Marmot Gore-Tex perfection) and Jason helped me send home my package of unused gear. I slipped two stickers in there for Truitt! Every place I stay I am collecting stickers for Truitt and patches for me. Still need some more string before I sew on my Neel Gap ""Mountain Crossings"" patch.Afterward, we headed back to Chipmunk bc we heard there was going to be some trail magic right by us in Raccoon cabin. We went over and we were greeted by a cooler stocked with beer and soda on the front porch and the smell of chili and hot dogs inside. The owners of a hiker hostel in Erwin, TN (66ft off the trail) were putting on the magic. Their names are Uncle Johnny and Charlotte. Amazing people and so interested in each of our stories. They are from Alabama but have been running the hostel in Erwin for many years. Uncle Johnny said that the inside of his farmhouse is full of wormy chestnut. He told us of the plight that killed hundreds of thousands of chestnuts that were as impressive as the Sequoias out west. How wonderful it would be to have hiked beside them. Anyway, eventually about 30 ppl were piled in this tiny cabin all talking and eating and happy. Pretzel told me his love story. He met his girlfriend while hiking the PCT. Sinatra, Spaceman, and Farmer Joe arrived. It was a party but I stuck with having just one beer and a Pepsi. After about 2 hours of that I walked back to Chipmunk, made another pizza and worked on posting my blog some more. Paul, Ria. And I had began a game of Settlers of Catan (Paul packed a travel size in his pack). Ria and I had never played before so Paul patiently taught us how to play step by step...you can tell he has three younger sisters. Went to bed around 12am. The next morning we took our time gathering everything back in our packs (it's amazing how much crap you can fit in such a small bag that you carry on your back). We headed up to the outfitters around 11:45am. There were tons of ppl and camping vendors were setting up their product tents for the Mountain Crossings thru-hiker season kick-off. Festivities and free food started at 1pm but we were planning on getting out of there. It was a sad day for us bc Echo and Paul were not joining us  Echo's knee was too painful for her to hike so they decided to take another zero and see what happens from there. We set off intending to camp at Whitley Gap Shelter. It was a beautiful day with many steep inclines but doable. My right knee was bothering me on every downhill and Ria confessed that her left heel was starting to feel pain on the uphills. Whitley Gap Shelter is a mile and a half off the AT and not a flat 1.5 at that. We got there around 4:30pm and it was starting to get dark fast. It was empty except for myself, Ria, and Turtle. While we were eating we saw Spaceman rolling down the hill to the shelter. From there it was a good night. Spaceman has a huge gallon bag of flaming hot Cheetos which he shared...so grateful so tasty. I could've eaten the whole bag but I resisted. Beautiful sunset and beautiful sunrise. Ria and I headed it without Turtle and Spaceman bc they were taking a little more time to get going. Ran into Farmer Joe and Sinatra on top but kept going. We thought Turtle would eventually catch up but he never did. We did slow uphill and slow downhill bc of our pains. We ran into an ATC RidgeRunner named Bill who had just finished cleaning up Low Gap Shelter and was attempting to carry 6lbs of hiker trash (he was not happy about it). We made it to Low Gap Shelter and spread out in the sunshine. It was still early so we filtered water, washed our feet, and relaxed. Eventually BowTie showed up (from Knoxville) and The Kid (18 year old from PA). Bowtie said he planned to camp 1.5 further up the trail and we decided to join him a bit later. Eventually Turtle, Spaceman, Sinatra, etc showed up as we were leaving. We hiked the 1.5 and set up our tents in Poplar Orchard Campsite. Great location. Free-to-go was already set up, along with Bowtie. A group of 3 guys showed up after awhile. One wearing a kilt (Wee Gillis from NC), one from the Netherlands (Wolf Peak), and one from Germany (Raza aka Sasha). They each set up their tents before Turtle and Spaceman showed up and it was a full house. FREE-to-go made a camp fire and I cooked my ramen with my pot directly on the coals which worked great. Another beautiful sunset. Wind began to LITERALLY howl that night. Slept well but wind was crazy. Woke up, made oatmeal a shot going at 9:15am. Bowtie and free-to-go had already left by 7am. Also woke up with a text from Paul saying he had booked it to Low Gap Shelter (1.5 away) bc Echo went to Urgent Care and is staying in a hotel for a couple days for her knee. Sad for echo but we were excited to have Paul so close to us! We set off at a slow pace. After about a mile there was Paul right behind us! We were overjoyed! Turtle had gone ahead so we became 3. The uphill today was very long but extremely gradual so easy. Fantastic weather too at 65 degrees and sunny. Unfortunately, Ria had a hard day today. Her Achilles is really hurting her and she was coming down hard on herself. She is so resilient and she got through it! We find ourselves tackling new lows ever day. One day, I'm crying on the last 100 yds to the shelter, another day, Ria is fighting through feeling defeated from her heel. It's all part of the trail. Paul began singing and read 2 pages from a book called The Pilgrim at Tinker Creek and it just made everything so much better. I'm telling you, this guy has helped Ria and I get through some tough times. I'll finish today's tale tomorrow bc I am TIRED!","Neel Gap

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522541,"The rest of Day 8 & 9 - Blue Mtn Shelter to Hiawassee, GA 3/1/2016Picking up where I left off yesterday. We made it to Blue Mountain Shelter around 2pm and it was gorgeous weather. Ria and j laid out our Gossamer Gear polycro tarps and got some sun. Turtle and Spaceman were already there, they decided to sleep in the shelter. Paul, Ria and I set up our tents. While doing this Dark Water and Rusty Bridges showed up and began setting up as well. Dark Water was around 50 and said he was from rural NH but had unwillingly lived in Louisville for 9 years. Rusty Bridges is 34 and such a nice guy from VA. Again, we were the only girls in at this shelter. Paul built a roaring fire under a beautiful night sky filled with stars. Before hanging out around the fire I finally pooped in the woods...even though there was a privy. Sorry for the overshare but this was a big deal for me. It was certainly an experience, very difficult to maneuver. Anyway, we had dinner with a fantastic view the entire time. One more hiker showed up before it got too dark. His name was Andrew from upstate NY. Had time off from his landscaping job and decided to hike until he was called back to work. Interesting guy, very interested in salamanders so we gave him the name Mud Puppy (which is the name of a salamander he found right before the shelter). He told us that he stayed at Springer Mtn shelter the night of the crazy snow storm (we were at Woods Hole) and there were two crazy hippies pressuring people to buy jewelry. Another guy in a tent was experiencing symptoms of hypothermia and had stripped down to shorts and a tshirt (bc his mind made him think he was burning up) and was running around the camp site trying to get warm. He had called 911 and EMT's had climbed the mountain to get him...wow!Great rest of the night, cold but no rain. Woke up this morning around 7am to watch the sunrise. Packed up and ate my last oatmeal. We had decided to resupply in Hiawassee, GA today so it was a short 2 miles to Unicoi Gap. We knew we would have to hitchhike and the guys wanted to split Ria and I up and use our female attraction but we refused. It worked out wonderfully. I stuck out my thumb in the gap parking lot and the 3rd car that passed stopped to pick us up. So perfect! Two women from Ashville, NC in an old van were dropping off Trail Magic (cooler of beer). Their names were Elle Woods and Wonder. They got married last January and they are beginning their AT thru-hike in 10 days. Turtle, Ria and I sat in the trunk with all the packs while Spaceman and Paul sat in the bucket seats and talked with the girls. They said we smelled like ""ass crack"" and we all died laughing. There comes a time where you smell so bad that you can't smell yourself. They drove us 12 miles west to Hiawassee and dropped us off at an outfitters. I bought some fuel and then Ria and I walked up the road to a grocery store called Ingles. It was weird having to walk through town in order to get where you need to go. We are all so used to zipping up the street in our own cars when really it's a short, pleasant 15 minute stroll. Ingles was the best, I definitely got way too much food. 2 older women struck up a conversation with Paul and ended up buying his $75 worth of food for him which is the best trail magic yet! If anyone deserves this, Paul does. We went to the deli and got lunch on top of everything else. Oh and before this I got a chocolate eclair long john and ate it while walking around Ingles with my huge, smelly pack in the cart. For lunch I got a huge serving of pulled pork BBQ, mac'n'cheese, green beans, Dr Pepper and a Nerd's Rope. Paul got an entire rotisserie chicken with 3 bananas, Ria for a huge salad, cornbread, olives and a mozzarella ball. We sat in the cafe section and began to devour everything in front of us.Then the logistical planning began...Tray Mtn straight out of Unicoi Gap, bow to hitch back to the gap, thunderstorms with temperatures dropping to low 20s after rain, and shelter a good 6 miles away with it being 3pm at the time of discussion. Spaceman and Turtle were elsewhere while this conversation was happening. Ria's Achilles pain slows our pace on the uphills (we don't want her to go normal pace and potentially hurt herself) which would keep us from getting to the shelter by dark. By that point we made the decision to stay in Hiawassee, Turtle and Spaceman were down too so we all split a room at the Holiday Inn for $25 a person. We also got to do LAUNDRY!!! So happy!!!We got beer from Ingles and we truly relaxed. I sewed my Mtn Crossings patch on my pack (which took about 2 hours) while Spaceman sewed a portion of an old tshirt that says ""don't panic"" on his pack. Love it. After laughing and watching SVU we went back to Ingles for dinner. I got a Boar's Head sub with chips and drink for $5. Great deal. We came back and ate in the room while watching Modern Family. We all got showers, yessss.In the morning, Ria and I plan on walking to the outfitters and post office around 8am bc I need a new food stuff sack and she needs to mail some letters. My current food bag was unable to hold the insane amount of food I bought so when I carried it by the handle it just ripped the buckle. UGH!!! Knee pain still there on downhills but stretches that the Ridgerunner taught meSeem to be helping. Head to Tray Mtn shelter tomorrow and should be a nice day!","Hiawassee, GA

Obviously, we had a great nights sleep, clean laundry, warm showers, etc. I ate the rest of my sub sandwich for breakfast along with dr. pepper, yogurt, and a cinnamon roll...so tasty...I'm dreaming of all those things right now. Ria, Paul, and I were ready around 9:30am but the others weren't so I used the time to transfer my journal over to my phone to later upload. We went down to the front desk around 10:30am and Spaceman went ahead and called a shuttle for us bc we found 4 other ppl to hop in with us. $8 a person and we all split between two cars. Both Subaru outbacks woot woot represent! The shuttle service was run by Joyce and Sally. They came down to Hiawassee, GA about 15 or 20 yrs ago, bought 2 acres of land and started running shuttles. She said they also do organic gardening.Sally was fun to talk to. She dropped us off at Unicoi Gap. Rusty Bridges was there finishing a cigarette. He said he had been dropped off at the gap at 8 or 9am but had forgotten his trekking poles in his shuttler's car. The driver said he couldn't get back til 11am so Rusty jumped in another shuttle to go hang at a hotel til his poles could be dropped off. Unfortunately, his original shuttle has been able to come by the gap earlier than he thought. But by that time Rusty was on his way back to a hotel in Hiawassee. Needless to say he wasn't too happy about starting at noon. Although it didn't seem to bother him for long. He's a really genuine, chill and happy guy to be around. He told us that his trail name is Rusty Bridges bc he and another guy friend had created Rusty as an alter-ego when out on the town. Apparently, Rusty Bridges is a drop out minor league baseball player who played at Oklahoma City State...love it.It was a big uphill out of Unicoi Gap and one of our fellow hikers decided to make a really rude remark toward me right when we had started so I was pretty heated. Overall everyone on the trail has been so fun and kind but he is obviously not one of them. It takes all kinds I guess. Oh, also, Rusty Bridges wrote an amazing poem which included hilarious references to both Cheetah and Jelly Ankles. I wish I could remember it to write it down. Anyway, it was a good day, we went slow and steady with all miles leading to Tray Mountain. My knee still hurt on the downhills but I was flying on the uphills. My legs felt good and fresh...until Tray Mtn. I must have pushed too hard bc my knee began hurting on the climbs. No wildlife so far except for the random bird (still rare to hear or see) or the dreaded mice. I DO NOT like mice. Ron Brown (our Springer Mtn shuttle driver) told us that the Army Rangers train in this area and they have scared off a lot of the wildlife with their gunfire. There are leafless, dead poplar trees everywhere and dead brown leaves carpet the trail. It is still beautiful in its own way. Every once in a while we will come upon Mountain Laurel or Rhododendron...I can't wait for these to bloom. Climbing to the top of Tray Mtn was a 1.5 mile batter, but so pretty. Probably around 4,500 feet elevation so it was cold but very clear views. There was a surprising amount of greenery near the top of the mountain. The trail was lined in bright green moss and there were literal flakes of the purest white snow mixed in with the green. We had the Mtn all to ourselves and once we hit the summit we knew the long uphil was worth it. All the mountains in the distance were layered on top of one another like an infinite ocean of blue waves. From there we descended to Tray Mtn Shelter. Beautiful location but lots of wind and it got cold fast. Ria and I put up our tents and made dinner. My dinner consisted of ramen, cheese and pita, cosmic brownie, and a clementine. We try not to drink water in the evening, or night (although we should) bc we don't want to have to get up in the middle of the freezing night and pee. Ria suggested that I sleep with her in her 2 person tent to keep warm. It worked! Also, Rusty Bridges told us to put our clothes on top of our sleeping bags instead of wearing them. That way, the hear has space to move around and actually hear up more. He had a better explanation of it but whatever. Slept ok but woke up whenever I moved around. Woke up this morning, windy and pretty cold. My knee was very stiff. It was fun waking up with Ria next to me bc we immediately started laughing and talking about how we never want to move out of our sleeping bags. Took a while to get going but we left around 9:30am. Immediate downhill so my knee was killing me at first. Once it warmed up and I started taking small steps the knee felt much better. The weather forecast said 40 degrees and then snow around 2pm. 7.7 mile day. Our big climb today was Kelly Knob and it was definitely the hardest yet. 1 mile straight up but the kicker is that it started snowing sideways. A man named Pampaw passed us and then we finally made it to the summit, put on our rain pants and pack covers. Another 60 something year old man named Ghost passed us and said he was headed to Deep Gap Shelter too. The shelter was about 8 tenths of a mile downhill and we could barely see Ghost's footprints it was snowing so much. Knee was in pain during this part. I think my knee knows when it's about quitting time. Deep Gal shelter (built in 1991) is by far the coolest shelter we've stayed in. Walls on all 4 sides and 2 lofts. When we got here Ria and I were greeted by Paul (yay!), Spaceman, Rusty Bridges, Turtle, Ghost, and a new face named Super Nova. Spaceman, Rusty Bridges, and Turtle headed out to Dicks Creek to sleep in a hostel but Paul stayed here. Ria, Paul and I are in one of the lofts. It's a tight squeeze but extra warm. After those guys left Irish Exit showed up and she is the spitting image of Ria. I mean, everyone in the shelter was freaked out. Then GP arrived and B-Rad. GP is an ex pro hockey player who actually played for the Cincinnati Cyclones. There are currently 6 inches and counting of snow on the ground. We are happy to be alive! Slow and steady and happy!","Hiawassee, GA

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522593,"Day 12 - Deep Gap Shelter to Top of Georgia Hostel/Dicks Creek Gap 3/4/16Woke up nice and warm this morning thanks to the close quarters of the loft at Deep Gap Shelter. GP had also sacrificed his tarp to use as a wind barrier over the door. I find that I wake up around 6:30am no matter what on the trail. I think this is bc my mind is filled with our daily plans. There were about 8 ppl in the shelter and all of them (except Ria, Paul and I) were out of there by 7:30am. How do they do it?We got moving around 7am. Ria and I walked a tenth of a mile to the stream and filtered out water for the day. This involves filling a 32oz plastic bag with a screw top. Once the bag is filled, I attach a small handheld filter the size of a small banana to the screw top of the 32oz plastic bag. On the free end of the filter there is a pop top that resembles a water bottle...this is where the filtered water comes out. The device is called a Sawyer Squeeze and you essentially let gravity do the filtering as you hold it upside down by the bag. So handy and very lightweight. I also have aquamira drops in case my filter breaks or freezes. Once the filter freezes it's useless and you might as well throw it away. That is why I often sleep with the filter in my sleeping bag and keep it on my body on really cold days. We left the shelter at 9:15am and immediately went uphill...in the snow/slush. The forest Chatahoochee National Forest) was gorgeous. All the limbs were covered in ice. Paul said they looked like strokes from a calligraphers pen. The fog was thick and it felt almost muggy. I could tell the sun was trying to peek through. My knee felt pretty painful on this climb and he pain has moved from the outside of my knee to the inside. We hiked the 4 miles to Dicks Creek Gap, most of which was through downhill skipper soupy mud (made possible by the shining sun melting last nights snow). Near the gap there was a beautiful streak with the cutest tiniest bench. When you sat on it you were forced to admire the prettiest little stream waterfall. We made it to Dick's Creek Gap. There we saw Rusty Bridges, Spaceman, and Turtle. Rusty had a 15L stuff sack he didn't need anymore and he gave it to me which helps my food bag plight...last night I had to hang 3 bags including my sleeping bag stuff sack. We ate lunch at the picnic table there. I sizzled some country ham...freaking delicious. I stuffed the country ham and white cheddar into the pits pocket and made the tastiest camp lunch in all the land. While eating, Paul noticed Ron Brown in his ""yellow blazin"" car. We went down to the parking lot. When he asked how we are I told him about my knee and he seemed very apprehensive about me going back on the trail at this point. He said there is no way to get off the trail for the next four days if I need a break or something bad happens with my knee. This really worried me so I called my mom to ask her advice (she said go into town to see a doctor), called Echo to see where her knee pain was when she had to get off the trail, and then Bob from Top of Georgia hostel came up and asked if we needed a shuttle or wanted to stay in a hostel tonight. I asked him about my knee and he said he knows a great doctor that he trusts in town. Ria mentioned that she is very interested in having her Achilles looked at as well so we made the decision to stay at the hostel. We jumped into his van and drove half a mile down the road.It's a really nice compound. The lobby area has big couches with tables and a big kitchen. Large picture windows look out over the beautiful view. There is a small gear shop with food and another full bathroom. The bunkhouse is a separate building but it is right next door. There are about 25 bunk beds in separate rooms. There's a full bath, kitchen and common room with lots of games and books. Very clean feeling. We threw our bags down frantically in order to make the 3pm shuttle to town and make the doctors office in town. An older gentleman named Charlie drove us. He thru-hiked with his wife in 2003 and is from NW Georgia. He was vey soft spoken and kind. He dropped us off at the Serendipity Clinic which is walk-in.From there, I didn't see Dr. Smith until 4pm but it was definitely worth the wait. Before being called back I spoke with Doug Howell (my chiropractor back home) and he told me that from the pain I described that it was definitely my IT band muscle and that the spreading pain was tendinitis forming in my knee. He said that I should get Ria to ""distract"" it then immediately ice for 20 mins then use stem machine if possible. When I saw Dr. Smith she said that was spot on advice so thank you Dr. Howell. Dr. Smith completely ruled out anything meniscus related and focused on my IT band. She said my quad was really swollen and then proceeded to stretch me for 45 minutes which was wonderful. She showed me some IT strengthening exercises and advised 48 hours of rest along with icing, Tylenol, and ibuprofen. Afterward, she saw Ria for an hour as well so I took the time to call Truitt. He is such a good sport about my whole adventure but I miss him and know this is not easy for either of us. I have also been receiving tons of support via text from friends and family which has helped so much. Truitt's father, Kevin, is sending a countdown everyday with the numbers he finds while out and about. One day it was gas pump number 9 in front of gas pump number 3 which read as 93. My parent's good friend John Carlin has been texting me about ultra-lightweight options and said he even sent me a package to Franklin, NC...if we ever get there. After leaving the clinic, Ria and I walked the 15 minutes to Ingles parking lot and waited for the shuttle to pick us up. By this time it was around 6:15pm. Ria was told by Dr. Smith that her Achilles is experiencing micro-tears and it's difficult to stretch the tendon bc that will only cause more agitation to it, gentle stretching is key and rest is even more important. Her Achilles problem is much more serious than IT band problems unfortunately. If she tears or even strains it too much she would be in too much pain to continue. We talked about the difficult decision to take take our second zero. We were both told 48 hours rest by the doctor. It's a tough call bc it's hard to sit still and watch everyone else head out in gorgeous weather. We decided to sleep on it and decide in the morning. Charlie picked up along with 3 other thru-hikers staying at the hostel. I can't remember their names. There were two 18 year old boys from NJ taking a gap year. They had already spent 3 months in New Zealand farming at different organic farms (also called woofing). In the fall one is headed to NYU and the other to Carnegie-Melon. I think if I ever have a kid I want them to do a gap year.The third guy was called Knee-cap but I don't think that's his trail name. His knee had become infected underneath the kneecap. He has been at the hostel for 3 days and got off at Neel Gap. He said when he gets better he plans on skipping the 40 miles and re-starting at Dick's Creek Gap. We got back to the hostel and I iced my knee for 20 mins and then borrowed GP's stem machine and put it on my IT band and right side of knee for 30 mins. My knee was feeling good after all the positive attention it received today. Crawled into bed and now all the lights are off.","Deep Gap Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522633,"Day 13 - Zero at Top of Georgia Hostel 3/5/16Ria and I woke up this morning very refreshed. Most hikers were up and moving by 6:30am. We headed to grab breakfast at 7am. So delicious they had wonderful homemade apple bread with Apple butter on top. I had two pieces of that along with a sausage biscuit. Ria and I sat by Journeyman and Pampa. Journeyman turns 64 on the trail and is headed for Katahdin. He was pretty funny, especially when he said that sitting on the privy at Blue Mtn Shelter was like barely avoiding sitting on a stalagmite of poo. He's right! Some of these privys are coming close to overflowing. Pampa turns 59 on the trail and was an air traffic controller for his main career. He had some inventive ideas for how to fix the privy problems. One of them involved helicopters dropping port-o-potties at each of the shelters. Not sure how that would turn out.After breakfast Ria and discussed our ailments and whether we felt the need to take a zero or not. We are both apprehensive but we are in this for the long haul and are interested in getting as much healing as possible. We decided to take the zero.Also, Truitts father just sent me a text saying he bought a stem machine and would be willing to send it to me!!!All day Ria and I have been feeling a bit stir crazy. I went out on the back porch and found Ria in her sleeping bag laying on the ground which was quite a sight to see. We also met a few new people who arrived at the hostel today. I would say most of the hikers here are heading out tomorrow morning and seem to be pushing out high mileage. Almost everyone I've talked to is experiencing knee problems...one guy there has an infected blister on his arch.Some new faces that stick out are Snap, Eric, Emma and Mountain Man. Snap has been here since yesterday and has a really nice digital camera. He works in an ER in New Jersey and worked in an ER in NYC. Very crazy stories. He told us that he keeps vodka and a certain type of honey in his first aid kit. Also cayenne pepper powder is good to throw in wounds. They have a ton of different uses. I really enjoyed listening to him. Eric is a 50 something year old from Pennsylvania and he is fi to talk to as well. He loves to watch wrestling and has season tickets to Penn State's wrestling matches. We talked about UK basketball for a while and he said he loved Coach Pitino when he was a UK and only UK. Good for him! Emma is a junior at Duke taking a semester off to hike the trail. Very bubbly and sings a lot. Mountain Man is exactly like he sounds...camo buff on his head, big gray and black beard, 35, tall and big. He is sleeping on the bunk above me. Real nice jolly guy. He just spent an hour going through his pack trying to find gear to send home and is planning on only eating snacks and ""cold cooking."" Tomorrow we plan on getting up early, packing up our stuff, eating breakfast and the. Heading back to Dicks Creek to start toward Franklin, NC.","Top of Georgia Hostel

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523094,"Day 14 - Dicks Creek Gap to Muskrat Creek Gap 11.8 miles 3/6/16Woke up around 6am after a good night's sleep at Top of Georgia hostel. Luckily, Ria and I both had bottom bunks so it was easier to get all of our things together. Mountain Man is a fantastic snored. I'm pretty sure I could feel the bunk bed shaking with every snore. It didn't bother me at all, it was just impressive. Ate breakfast and had delicious homemade banana bread with apple butter on top. Also had some Earl Gray tea. The shuttle to Dick's Creek left at 8am and it was a full van. About half of the van got out at Dick's Creek and I believe the rest were being dropped at Unicoi Gap which is about 20 or so miles before Dick's. Ria and I planned to hike the 4.5 miles to Plum Orchard shelter and then make a judgment call on whether we felt good enough to continue on. Well, we made it to Plum Orchard 10:40am. Which meant we we were doing around 2 miles per hour. We felt great so we took a 15 minute break to eat a snack, pee and air out our feet. We saw a good amount of weekend hikers (today is Sunday) headed in the opposite direction to get out of the woods. After leaving Plum Orchard shelter it was a pleasant uphill. At one point we heard someone behind us imitating a bear sound...it was AK... a guy who had stayed at the hostel with us the night before. He brought Ria and I Girl Scout cookie flavored granola bars the night before so he seems really nice. He did a couple hundred miles of the trail back in 2011 and also did all of GA this past January so he knows the AT relatively well. He is from Tampa Bay, FL and is the manager of a Starbucks. He slowed his pace and joined us for the rest of our hike today. He distracted us on the uphills by talking about food. He would ask us what our favorite candy was, soda, fav ice cream, fav ethnic food, etc. Our heads and stomachs were dreaming of delicious food for the rest of our 11 mile hike. Today was also a big day bc we passed our first state line! We are officially out of GA and in NC. We stopped and took pictures with the sign and I felt the need to kiss it. I am so happy and proud of Ria and I. Yes, we have been going slow but we are still out here. I consider this an accomplishment and I will celebrate it by watching the sun rise in the morning. NC greeted us with our steepest and toughest climbs yet. We went from 2,000 ft to almost 5,000ft in less than 6 miles. Couthous Bald was so steep we could have climbed hand over foot if we wanted. We definitely pushed ourselves today but my knee feels fine and Ria said her Achilles was feeling ok. We received an inspiring thought today from my dad. A poem by William E Henley called Invictus. I have heard it before but we needed it today and we felt like warriors battling up those hills. ""Out of the night that covers meBlack as the pit from pole to poleI thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstances I have not winced nor cried aloudUnder the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody but unbowedBeyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but horror of the shadeAnd yet the menace of the yearsFinds and shall find me unafraidIt matters not how strait the gateHow charged with punishments the scrollI am the master of my fate;I am the captain of my soul""This resonated with us and our hike today. Another added disadvantage was the fact that when I weighed my pack at the hostel it weighed 41 lbs! This is terrible!! I immediately emptied two of my water bottles and left myself 2 liters of water in my camelback. This dropped me to 37 lbs. The culprit is my 9lb food bag. I need to not shop when I am starving. If I keep my food to 5 lbs I will be at 32lbs and that is perfect for me.After and amazing amount of uphills today we had only one mile (uphill of course) left to the shelter. We decided to air out our feet and eat a little something. By this point an older gentleman named Ken had joined us at mile 9. He had also stayed at the hostel last night and is from Coco Beach, FL. While us four were relaxing another thru-hiker, Wes, stopped to talk. He had just taken an entire week off bc he contracted an infection (not sure if it was MRSA) on his ankle in the first week on the trail. Crazy!Also, forgot to mention that right after NC/GA border there is this amazingly gnarly tree with a white blaze on it. It looks crazy, can't really describe it. There we ran into two young french guys hiking for 5 days. Back to Muskrat Creek shelter. This is a nice location. Almost everyone has chosen to camp and there are no food bag cables so we all had to hang out food bags ourselves. Thank for this isn't a poplar grove bc there were actually branches to hang stuff from. Also the privy is super private and the water runs right through the area. We met more new faces...Santa, his wife Wonder, Bill Nye, Clean Skittles, Bolt, Joe, and more. There are probably 15 ppl here in total. Heading to bed.","Dicks Creek Gap

We are women hear us roar!!! Yesterday was a doozy so we were a little concerned about where our legs would be this morning but besides a little stiffness everything felt good. Our new routine is to head out around 8 or 8:15am and to hit about 2 miles per hour. The terrain was very pleasant, lots of straightaways until Standing Indian Mountain which was a 3 mile climb. It must have been an old logging road bc it was very wide and the switchbacks were on very level and lovely inclines. So far our tallest point at 5,500 ft. NC is beautiful. Birch trees with silver bark and many groves of Mtn Laurel interspersed among miniature waterfall streams. Today we talked a LOT about food. We are both severely craving milkshakes. Franklin is a day and a half away so you better bet that's one of the first stops in town. AK joined us for a while today. We also ran into new fast ppl from Michigan, Mara and Jeremy. Doubt we will ever see them again. Sunshine and Rags were a father/son section hiker team out for 7 days from ATL. Very nice and motivated. Told us that his father/grandfather had thru-hiked back in the 90s.We felt very weary at mile 11 with 1.5 left but we finished strong and camp location/shelter is very nice. We also like the ppl with us. There is a guy with knee problems from Miami named Shrink (he is a counselor) and he goes a little slower pace than us. He is fun to be around bc he is super animated, funny and talkative. Also, Santa and Wonder are here again. Wes ""Quick"" is here too. He is an interesting fellow. In his 30s and out of the Navy. He is going to law school in the fall as well and wants to specialize in environmental law. There is also a new face who I suspect we will only see once, Noah. From NYC and very intelligent. He studied physics and mathematics. Goes on 20 mile days so I doubt we will see him again after this but he was interesting to talk to. Shrink built a fire after dinner so we all sat around and laughed. Oh! Ken was here too. He is such a nice quiet guy. Looking forward to Albert Mountain tomorrow. Supposedly it is a hand over foot climb at some points. We are almost to 100 miles!","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523132,"Day 16 - Carter Gap Shelter to Rock Gap ShelterToday was a very interesting day. I think I experienced every emotion on the spectrum. I slept horribly last night. I found out that I set my tent up on a very gentle slope. I woke up around 1:30am with all my toes numb and my digestive system was not working (as in no flatulence). Simply could not sleep. I was completely awake staring at the ceiling of my tent. Around 4am I flipped my body around so my head was higher than my feet. This immediately made a difference. Blood began circulating to my feet and my digestive system went back to normal. Still didn't fall asleep until 5am but slept deeply until my alarm went off at 6:30am.It was amazing bc we were awakened by 2 owls hooting to one another. They had to have been in the middle of our camp bc it seemed to be coming from right above us. It was so relaxing and calming to wake up in your warm sleeping bag to very distinct and (to me) rare sounds of nature. I have never had an experience like this and I feel lucky.Eventually everyone got up and moving. I really enjoy being around this group of hikers. Shrink, Santa, and Wonder are all fantastic, kind, and caring people to be around. We also met two section hikers who are faculty (not sure if both are) at UGA. Their names are Brian and Norbert and they stayed up with us around the fire and were so fun to talk/listen to. Brian is from all over (born in France, grew up in Holland, California, etc) and Norbert is from Florida although I didn't catch exactly where. So many Floridians on the trail! Wish they were thru-hiking but they said they might come to Rock Gap to see us again. We hiked out around 8:30am.It was AK, Quick, Shrink and Ria. We had 6 miles to Albert Mtn. After 4 miles we came to Betty Creek campground (by this time Shrink had fallen behind bc of his hurt knee) and Ria and I stopped to take our shoes and socks off. We try to do this at east twice a day and it really helps to keep our feet dry and fresh. From there we headed uphill for a 2.5 mile climb to the top. Gradual at first. AK and Quick pulled away, Shrink fell behind so Ria and I were left to hike alone. I think these are the times I most enjoy while hiking. Even when we silently hike, I prefer hiking with just Ria. We have a great time, know when to lift each other's spirits, when to laugh and often feel the same about pushing through to our goal. I am very grateful for her presence. Without a doubt I couldn't do this without her. The terrain began to change and all of a sudden it felt like we were hiking in a temperate rain forest. 70 degrees on the side of a mountain, lots of water, beautiful rocks, boulders, greenery, moss, dripping water on a bed of moss. I would say this has been the most interesting terrain so far. We ran into AK and Quick who were waiting for us at the base of the straight up section of the mountain. 500 ft straight up. Immediately it was rock scrambling. My calves were on fire and I had my poles under my arms so that I could better use my hands. At one point the weight of my pack began pulling me backward and I got nervous but I regained balance and continued.The top of Albert Mtn was absolutely breathtaking. We were so high up (5200 ft) that parts of the view were hazy from the heat. There is a firetower at the top which we climbed as well. I climbed it but immediately went back down bc it gave me the heebie jeebies. We sat down and had a long lunch. Ria and I took our shoes off and laid ourselves out on the rock like snakes soaking up the sun. Noah from Carter Gap showed up and hung for awhile. AK and Quick went on and Shrink, Ria, Noah and I left about 10 minutes later. We had 6 more miles to Rock Gap Shelter and we were all extremely fatigued from the climb. Shrink fell back and Noah stopped for water and again it was just Ria and I. Our legs were exhausted and feet in pain. Luckily, my knee and her Achilles has not been giving us any pain which is huge but she didn't sleep well 2 nights ago and I barely slept last night so we were absolutely exhausted. This is when you become slap happy. We dragged our poles behind us at one point. Tripped every other step from lazy feet, laughed til we cried, then focused silence where each of us know the other is dying with every step. The straightaways become the hardest bc there's no challenge so your feet become even lazier and you feel as if you could walk with your eyes closed.At 2 miles from the shelter we began our uphill and I turned on rap music to get us up the hill. It was great, we sang and danced up the last uphill and walked faster than we had all day. Once we came over the top and started to go downhill I turned the music off and we began to remember the pain in our feet. My toes in particular are menacing me with every step. But this is what everyone out here feels it's up to me to decide my attitude. Ria and I rolled into Rock Gap Shelter around 4pm. This location is interesting for several reason:Controlled forest fires in the distance plus ranger helicopters.A tree fell on this shelter while hikers were inside (no one hurt)They repaired the shelter in February 24th so everything looks new with the huge fallen tree chopped up beside it.Santa, Wonder, Coco Ken, Quick, AK, and a new guy named Tim were here. Noah and Shrink eventually showed up. Ria and I set out tents directly next to the shelter. I have REALLY enjoyed Santa and Wonder's company. They are very concerned about who is around us and they make me feel safe. Santa is 6'4 and a 12th grade teacher while Wonder is a petite 5'5 and a kindergarten teacher. They have 3 daughters one of which (Courtney) is an attorney in Massachusetts. They are taking a Nero tomorrow in Franklin but we are trying to convince them to take a zero with us the next day so we can stay on track with us.While talking to Wonder (she and Santa were telling me about the condition of some of the poorest ppl in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Also apparently they got married when she was 23 and went to Jamaica for their honeymoon...don't know why this makes me so happy but I think it's just so wonderful) Brian and Norbert showed up!!!! Excited that they decided on the 12.1 mile day to spend the evening with us. A big group of very serious seeming AT thru-hikers rolled in. All male and one had a large ""AT"" tattoo on his calf which was cool. They didn't say much to us but seemed nice. We all said goodnight around 8:30pm and crawled into our tents. I'm hoping to sleep soundly tonight bc we want to be up and moving by 6am tomorrow to catch the shuttle into town by 9:45. AK graciously made reservations for us at Haven's Budget Inn which was very nice. Oh, before signing off tonight, Shrink described his limo as very closely imitating that of Far Joe the rapper's limp in his song, ""lean back."" Literally looks exactly like the move in the music video and Ria and I cried with laughter today. Hard day but everything is simply wonderful. P.s. Paul texted us and said that he's leaving Franklin in the morning but would be willing to take a Nero to wait for us!","Carter Gap Shelter

Woke up on day 17 really early to get out of camp and to the shuttle by 9:30am to get into Franklin. Got moving at 7am. We met the Mayor in the morning before we left. He had come in with the group of guys who had previously hiked the AT. The Mayor had a beautiful Japanese Sheba dog named Katana. She hiked most of the AT with him in 2014. He also wrote the book ""Lost on the Appalachian Trail"" which is awesome. I look forward to reading it when I get home. Very nice guy.

Beautiful day and easy mileage.We spoke with Shrink and decided to share a room with him instead of AK & Quick because we had previously agreed to share a room with him at Carter Gap Shelter and didn't want to break any promises. Coming into Winding Stair Gap there was trail magic right before the parking lot (sodas). Then we got to the parking lot and there was a guy named Rodney putting on trail magic from his truck. He had fresh fruit, cookies, and drinks set out in the bed of his truck. Nice fellow who didn't say too much.There were about 25 hikers in the parking lot waiting for Ron Haven's shuttle to his motel (free if you stay with him). He is also the former town commissioner of Franklin. He showed up but couldn't fit everyone so he told everyone else to get on the town shuttle and he would reimburse each of us for the $3 ride. Such a sweet guy.We rode in with Noah, Ken, Wonder, Santa, AK, Quick, Shink and some other folks. Ken is so kind. He gave up his seat so that Ria and I could sit down. He sat in the back amongst all the smelly packs. We were dropped off at Ron Haven's Budget Inn and sure enough, he reimbursed everyone for their ride. He accidentally messed up our room so we got sent across the street and got a larger room for the same price. Definitely not the most sanitary situation but large and comfortable. Standards are lowered when you live in the woods most of the time. Noah (Rhodo) said he needed his own room the 1st night to decompress and then he would move in with us on the second night.We took showers and then headed up the street to Outdoor 76 to pick up all of our boxes. We immediately ran into Journeyman. He was checking out the store when we walked in. A woman named Danielle trapped ALL of 8 boxes. I had 5 and Ria had 3. We have been the butt of so many jokes because of our mega mail drop.We needed a place to go through our boxes and luckily the store had an awesome tap room in the back. We bought a beer and borrowed some scissors to get started.I received boxes from my mother/father (a box I organized before leaving), Truitt, Margaret Burke, John Carlin, and The Dillahuntys. Holy crap I was more than overwhelmed from the amount of love and support from my family, friends, and boyfriend. Wonderful letters, poetry, good, gear, etc. Margaret sent a bag of delicious granola along with homemade granola bars, nutella, and many other goodies. John sent hot hands, an inflatable solar lantern, a leatherman, oil of oregano pills, and more. Treat sent sweet tarts (my fav), dried mangos and a UK pin to attach to my pack. The Dillahuntys sent new skin, bordeaux's butt cream, dark chocolate, and many letters filled with love. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO SPENT THE MONEY AND TIME TO PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE!!! I am so so so grateful for you all. I had a smile plastered on my face for about 5 hours thanks to you guys.After a while Journeyman came over and joined us. Ria bought him a beer and he told us about his trip to Vietnam, his plans to run the very first marathon route in Greece and his grand daughter in Asheville, she's 4 years old. A lot of what he said resonated with me. He explained that he likes to think of himself as ""sauntering"" along the Appalachian Trail. He likes this word because it translates to ""Saint Terre"" which then means to ""walk with reverence upon this earth."" What a holy mission, whatever your faith. I love to think of myself sauntering on the Appalachian Trail, appreciating everything beside, above and underneath me. We could all take a lesson from Journeyman. We talked to him for about 3 hours before parting to go back to our room. We exchanged number so that we could meet up for dinner later. Santa and Wonder stopped in the store and we planned on rendezvousing with them for dinner as well. Spaceman texted us and said he had come back to town bc his right foot was killing him and he needed a zero. We invited him to dinner as well. Around 5:15pm we started walking through Franklin to Lazy hiker Brewing. They had a food truck that looked delicious so we got a beer and waited till it opened at 5:30pm. Phillip was behind the bar and told me that the beef steak tacos were the best thing on the menu...I got the tacos along with french fries. It was a full house at dinner and such a nice day. We all sat outside. It was Ria (Cheetah), Wonder, Santa, Coco Ken (he got a name!), Journeyman, AK, Quick, Bolt, Shrink, and Joe. We sat and talked for a really long time. Wonder invited us to their home in NH for her birthday which is June 28th (two weeks after Flag Day hehe). I am seriously tempted. We have loved their company and would like nothing more than to celebrate Wonder's bday in NH. After Lazy Hiker, AK & Quick walked to Mulligan's to meet up with the Mayor and his friends. We headed to Motor Co Grill for a much desired milkshake. Joe and Bolt decided to stay for more beer, so it was just me, Ria, Coco Ken, Santa, Wonder, and Shrink. I felt really happy and content at that moment with those people. Spaceman joined us for milkshakes and it was wonderful to see him again! Ken got vanilla, Wonder got cherry, I got chocolate obviously. We walked back to the budget Inn and said goodnight to Spaceman, Wonder, Santa and Ken. The last 3 were leaving in the morning so we were all sad. We were all full and exhausted. I could barely stay awake enough to get changed and obviously didn't write in my journal that night. We woke up to our 3rd legitimate zero day and got moving. We walked across the street bc we saw that Ken, Santa, and Wonder were leaving for the woods. Big hugs all around and one last plea for them to stay. They got on the shuttle and we waved goodbye. AK and Quick came out and we walked about a mile to Ms. Lois's. Typical southern diner food. It was a good sign that everyone in there was local. That means respected food. I got a plain pancake, a chocolate pancake, hash browns, and bacon. Very tasty.Shrink stopped at the tobacco shop on the way back to the budget Inn and then he parted ways to go to the post office to send his boots back. He purchased new boots at Outdoor 76 and sent home full-grain leather LL Bean boots that were hurting his knee overtime he walked. Ria and I went back to find Noah packed up and ready to move into our room.Once back Ria and I began the long process of sorting through all of our food items and gear that was sent to us. Almost 3/4 of my mail drop I put into a box to bounce forward to myself at Fontana Dam. We walked to the post office and I spent $8 on a box home and $10 on a box to Fontana Dam Post Office. Can't wait to open up that box and find lots of yummy treats.Walked back to room and I spent a long time uploading and transcribing my journals online. It feels good to have a motivating factor that makes me write each night. I would be mad at myself if I didn't record what I am going through everyday. Decided on Moto Co Grill for dinner and Snap came in town and joined us. He takes amazing photos. His instagram in @hikes.camera.adventure if you wanted to follow him. He is out here for about 30 days and documenting everything he can. He said he is just now getting to Blood Mountain in his editing process. Got a burger, fries, mac n cheese for dinner and a chocolate milkshake. Food coma. Couldn't finish it. I was in physical pain from being so full. AK, Quick, Noah, Snap, and Ria went to Ingles. Shrink and I walked back to the hotel bc we desperately needed to use the restroom. Noah (Rhodo) and Ria (Cheetah) came back 30 mins later and Snap joined with some beer. I did not partake in any drinking I was so tired again and I called my parents to try and make plans for time together in Gatlinburg. Went to bed around midnight.Woke up at 7am bc the shuttle was leaving from the Budget Inn at 9am. Packed everything up. Walked across the street and threw our bags in the old van. The Mayor, Lorax, Tots, & Schwepps were loading up as well. Ria and I climbed to the back seat. Of the 11 miles that day we had 9 that were uphill. My legs started out and stayed very fatigued. I think starting my period also messed with my body. Very hot as well around 70 degrees and sunny. We headed toward Wayah Bald Shelter. Shrink drank two beers before starting which got him going real fast. He was flying and claimed no knee pain. Also Paul (now Corncob) informed us that they were waiting for us at Wayah Bald Shelter!During our day we stopped many times. We ran into Sinatra, Farmer Joe, Minute Man & Strange relaxing on a bald. Strange is also from KY and actually lived in Red River Gorge for 15 years. He even had a Miguel's hat on. Next we ran into some trail magic around mile 10 on top of Wayah Bald. A guy named Kicho who when to UK for school was putting it on. I sat down and had a honey bun, gatorade, goldfish, and trail mix. We came to a stone observation tower. From there we could see Clingman's Dome which was pretty cool.We headed toward the shelter. The day was so long & so hard for me. I am very grateful for Ria. She gets me through when I could've just petered out at mile 8. We made it to the shelter and we were greeted by Turtle, Corncob and Rusty Bridges. It was good to see their faces after such a long time. Dinner, jokes, fire, sleep.","Rock Gap Shelter

Slept in the shelter and was paranoid about mice all night so slept semi-ok. Warm night, I don't think it went down past 55 degrees. I got hot in my sleeping bag so I unzipped the lower part of the mummy to air out my hot feet. We left camp at 8:15am and hiked uphill toward the last shelter sign we saw...which was .25 of a mile away. Once we arrived, we realized that we had gone the wrong way on the trail...whoops! We cursed ourselves and turned around and went the .25 back down to the shelter. We were doing a good pace. While passing the shelter (for the second time) we saw Strange and he told us not to feel bad. While he was thru-hiking the PCT he once went 15 miles in the wrong direction. I would hate my life if we did that. Ria and I hiked on at a good clip. Passed a lone camper, flat terrain until we passed Sinatra, Minute Man and Farmer Joe. Once we passed them we went 1 mile uphill. Legs felt good. Knee felt good. We talked about middle school and memorable experiences. We passed Turtle and Rusty Bridges. Then a 2 mile uphill. Passing the 1st shelter we ran into Corncob and Shrink. I needed to eat and air out my feet desperately so Ria and I stopped at a small overlook shortly after seeing them.There was a 30ish section hiker and his 2 dogs on the vista. He is doing two 40 mile trips a year until he finished the whole AT. He said it will take him 25 years. We hiked on, flat terrain on the ridge. Ria climbed the Rocky Bald while I went ahead and found a quiet spot to journal and wait for her. I did not enjoy hiking alone. I think I would need to listen to a book or music to occupy myself. Had a long downhill then an exhausting uphill with 1.8 miles until the shelter. This one was a doozy. When we made it to the top we saw Shrink, Corncob, and a couple others. We climbed the wooden, rickety observation tower and took pictures. I was pretty scared. Oh, Rhodo was there! Rhodo is Noah's trail name. We christened him with it yesterday. Rhodo is short for Rhododendron. He uses the leaves as toilet paper. He says he prefers the leaves to toilet paper. Love it!Anyway, climbed down and headed to the shelter. Supposed to rain tomorrow so we grabbed a spot in the shelter. Shrink built a fire, Corncob told jokes, we met a new girl named Ash, an older guy named Slug. Sinatra and crew showed up. Nutella is camping here. We head to Nantahala Outdoor Center tomorrow. It is 6 miles of downhill from here. Goodnight.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524175,"Day 21 - 3/13/16 Wesser Bald Shelter to Nantahala Outdoor Center 6 miles7:45am. Woke up and it is pouring outside. Put on all of our rain gear and headed out only to find that it wasn't raining as much as we thought. So hot and humid. We were dying from the humidity while being in our sticky rain gear.This was the most beautiful day of hiking I think we have had. Mint green moss hung from every tree as if it were hair. It blew in the wind which made the effect even more believable. Lots of downhill rock scrambling. Came out to the most breathtaking view at the Jumpoff. Clouds were low and interspersed among the mountains which gave the scene an ""other-worldliness"" feel. We were simply awe-struck by the beauty.Right before this vista Corncob was telling us that he was troubled by subletting problems at home and needed a bit of positive vibes today. After bringing this up we immediately stumbled upon this view. Needless to say it helped brighten his mood. It's as if it were fated.From there, Turtle and Rusty joined us on the rest of the downhill. We eventually shed our rain gear and continued on the 6 miles of downhill toward the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). Corncob introduced the game of 20 questions which turned frustrating bc he had picked an exceptionally hard ""thing"" which turned out to be a firework.The miles went by quickly and we stopped for a snack at the Rufus Shelter (0.5 from the NOC). Rusty stuck with Cheetah and I after that and he told us about some of his vulnerable moments on the trail. He is using the AT as a way to reintroduce himself into a social world outside of work and family. I liked thinking about how many use it as a way to isolate themselves form the real world even though it is one of the most social atmospheres I have every been in. I think Rusty has it right.Walking down into the NOC was interesting. It is a kayaking and white water rafting haven. It was interesting to be around other people besides hikers. Turtle's father met him there and we threw all of our bags in his van and headed to the restaurant. It was called River's End and sat right on the Nantahala River. There were about 12 of us eating together. We also saw AK & Quick. I got a burger and fries and Cheetah and I split a brownie supreme. The best part was the 3 glasses of chardonnay. I had been craving a nice cold glass of chardonnay for about 2 days. After lunch I walked over to the bunkhouse office and purchased a bed for Cheetah, Corncob and myself. $22 a person. Lorax walked over with me and he gave me a beer. Afterward I did mine and Cheetah's laundry with Rusty and Corncob. Rusty is one of the most genuine people I have ever met. I love how forthcoming he is about his emotions. I walked over to River's End to buy Lorax a beer to repay him for earlier. Sat and talked with them a bit. He fought fires out west and was a Sig Ep at Utah. They are (the Mayor, Schwepps, Lorax) getting off the AT around the Smokies and heading out west to thru-hike the PCT late April.Walked back to the bunkhouse and took a shower. Then went to the common area to get the bottle of wine Cheetah picked up for me. AK pushed the cork in bc we didn't have an opener. I stayed there for a long time. I drank a lot of the bottle plus a couple beers. I became a crazy UK fan and argued with Schwepps for an hour about how much Duke sucks...whoops. Fun night though. Don't think I will allow myself to do that again unless there is a zero the next day. Cheetah and I went to bed around 11:30pm.Also, while we were all checking in/settling in Cheetah was in our bunkhouse (called Fink) and I was in the restroom right by our bunkhouse. All of a sudden, Ria hear's a desperate cry of ""SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP MEEEEE!!!!"" She rightfully freaks out and runs out of the bunkhouse expecting to see someone in dire need of help. Instead she saw Rusty Bridges carrying all of his stuff along with a 6 pack of beer and a 20lb. broken box of food sent from his mom. As soon as he sees Cheetah he says, ""OH CHEETAH THANK GOD!"" Of course Cheetah starts dying laughing bc he is a sight to see and she thought it was an actual emergency at first. I came out of the bathroom at this exact moment and joined both of their laughter. Rusty couldn't find his bunkhouse and was exhausted after hiking up those stairs with a million things in his arms.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524179,"Day 22 - 3/14/16 Nantahala Outdoor Center to Sassafras Gap Shelter 7.7 milesWoof, I woke up around 7am pretty hungover and exhausted. Popped tylenol and ibuprofen for my knee and head and chugged some water. Cheetah eventually woke up and was also in a little pain. We decided to have a hardy breakfast at the River's End so we walked that way. Rusty saw us and joined. The bunkhouses are in a small concentrated compound on the side of a mountain. In the middle stood a recreation hall with a kitchen, playroom and bathrooms/showers underneath. Boys and girls are separated which was a relaxing change of pace from having to make the effort to be private about everything. The NOC is cut in half by the Nantahala River with a beautiful wooden bridge connecting the two halves. The 3 of us walked across the bridge to the restaurant which shares a side with the General Store and The Outfitters. Rhodo showed up during breakfast and ordered sweet potato pancakes which were delicious. I felt much less hungover but still not like a hiker should feel. Our task for the day was 7.7 miles of straight uphill. Needless to say I was feeling some anxiety about what was to come. During breakfast all Rusty got were 2 beers. He's awesome and sure knows how to take advantage of time in town. Walking back across the bridge we ran into Lorax, The Mayor and Schwepps. Ugh, I was so embarrassed. I apologized to Schwepps for the crazy UK fan talk and hung my head. They laughed. It took Cheetah and I a while to get moving. All the other girl hikers had headed out and it took everything I had to get my butt moving and pack up my stuff. Got our pack together by 10:30am and went down to the main drag of the NOC again. We saw Corncob, AK, Quick, Turtle and his friends head up the hill. We ran into Lorax, Schwepps, and the Mayor again. Lora was trying to convince us to do a higher mileage day but we said ""we'll see"" with no promises. We bid them farewell and went down to the river to filter water. Ria braided my hair and then we saw Rusty yelling at us to wait. He ran over and told us that Turtle had left already and wanted to hike with us. We finally got going around 12:30pm and Rusty came with us. The 7 miles began and at first it wasn't bad. My legs were very fresh and my hangover had surprisingly vanished. It was very pleasant hiking with Rusty. He told us about how important his family is to him and how amazing his father is. His father practices ""Crucial Conversations"" which is also a book. Hearing him praise his father made me think of my family. How lucky I am to have this time to truly reflect on the greatness of my father, mother, brother, etc. My life has been nothing but wonderful bc of their love and support. Up and up we went. We passed a fallen firefighter memorial (RIP Wade Sutton), we passed amazing minecraft-like rock formation, and we came upon the most breathtaking view. It began raining and started to get colder. We became fatigued. As soon as our good spirits began to falter we hit the shelter. 2 stories in the shelter tonight. We all smashed in bc it was a packed house. Slept well.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

This trail is building me, ass kicking climb by ass kicking climb. My mind and body feel strong.

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524227,"Day 24 - Cable Gap Shelter to Fontana Dam 3/16/16 8.2 milesToday was a weird day for me. I think it's bc I've been out here for almost 25 days bc my emotions are weird. We woke up at Cable Gap Shelter at 7:45am. My body was killing me from the previous day of 15 miles. Both feet were swollen and my lower body ached everywhere. I awoke to the sound of trees creaking in the wind. It took us a while to get going which makes me anxious. I enjoy getting out of the shelters by 8 or 8:30am. Left at 10am, ugh. Had about 2 miles of uphill before the long descent to Fontana Road. We could see the dam as we descended and all the water and boats made me crave sunny days on the lake...I am dirty and grimy from the long sweaty day.Once at the road we called the Fontana Village Shelter. $3 in to what can only be called a tiny resort town. There was a post office, general store and lodge. We went to the lodge for lunch first. It was a fancy place and I immediately felt more smelly than usual. There were also a ton of luxury vehicles in the parking lot with decals all over them. Lamborghinis, Porsches, Ferraris, Bentleys. Really strange for a mountain resort but I guess the surrounding curvy roads were to blame. Apparently it was an extremely wealthy car club from NYC. There were also lots of very skimpily dressed ladies with them. Per our shuttle driver, there was a van with an escort service decal that showed up and that's where all the women came from. Very interesting stuff!After lunch we printed off our Great Smoky Mountain National Park permits ($20 each) and headed down to the post office to retrieve our bounce boxes. I am most excited for the homemade granola bars Margaret Burke and her family sent me in Franklin. I ate all the Stingers that John Carlin sent me. I've found Stinger Gels and the Stinger Waffles and love them as well. Oh, also Cheetah was feeling like she was coming down with a cold yesterday so she tried two of the Oil of Oregano pills that John sent and she said she felt great today. Thanks John! I've also been using the New Skin from the Dillahuntys like crazy. So much so that I have turned fellow hikers on to it. And the sweet tarts were gone within 2 days, you're the best Truitt!Re-stocked at the General Store a tiny bit and then we took the 5pm shuttle back to Fontana Road. From there we hiked 2.5 miles. We bypassed the nicest shelter on the trail bc it had Norovirus there. One of our fellow hikers actually got it from staying there the other day. These last 2.5 miles were very weird for me. I was uncomfortable with stealth camping and the lack of people did not calm me. Also, the sun was setting which makes me anxious bc we didn't (we being Rhodo, Corncob and Cheetah) know where we were camping yet. Luckily right before crossing the dam we ran into 2 ppl who said they camp a lot on a fall away road right across the dam. We got to the road and were immediately me with a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign saying it is an out of use firing range. We went in anyway  I was very uneasy at this point but this seemed to be our only option with daylight running out fast. Everything got spookier when we passed a large animal trap (large enough for me to fit in) and a creepy shed. Did not like this at all!We set up our tents and hung our food far away. Ate far away from our tents and no camp fire. We eventually went back to the dam to see it all lit up at night. We laid in the middle of the road and stargazed. All of a sudden i started feeling very nauseous. Like I could vomit or... This got me very emotional for some reason. I think all of the unease, fatigue and anxiety were wearing on me. Also the idea of feeling so sick in the woods really caught me off guard. I asked if anyone wanted to go back and no one was feeling like they wanted to. I started to feel worse. I started silently crying and of course Cheetah noticed. I told her everything and we walked back to the camp site together. I was feeling exceptionally nauseous at this point. I broke down and Cheetah held me while I cried. What an amazing friend. I can't imagine doing any of this without her. I chugged water and started feeling a bit better. Finally bed.","Cable Gap Shelter

Woke up at 5:30am to the sound of something walking through our camp. There were also coyotes howling all night long. At one point the coyotes seemed as if they were right next to our camp. scared me to death. Didn't sleep much. I don't think I will be stealth camping again anytime soon.So much uphill today. Around mile 3 we ran into ""throne rock."" We were able to get service there so we spent about 30 minutes calling our moms and working out the details for Gatlinburg. They plan on picking us up at Newfound Gap which is mile 207. I also called Truitt to tell him I love him. Can't wait for April when I get to see him.Continued uphill to the firetower on Shuckstack. Very steep climb but bonus miles so we left our packs at the bottom. It felt like we were moonwalking. I felt myself pushing off the ground much harder than I needed. 30-35 lbs changes the comfort level of walking so much. My feet have gone from supporting 130lbs to supporting 165lbs and it takes its toll. I made it up two flights of stairs on the fire tower before sitting on my butt and going back down. One handrail was missing and at each turn there was no definitive hand railing. I am such a scaredy cat. But I like living and think going down will improve my chances of a longer life. Cheetah and Corncob made it up to the top.We still had 10 miles to go after the fire tower and by the time we left it was 2pm. This lack of time efficiency gives me anxiety. I don't like the idea of relaxing/eating/setting up in the dark. It's just not as easy to decompress from the day. It was tough but we made it to Russell Field Shelter around 7pm. We got our stuff up and then the sun set. Tessla and Rash were there. They are 16 & 17. Tessla got Norovirus which is freaking everyone out. He seemed fine but he wasn't touching anything. He said it was 2 days of hell. Apparently it's all through the Smoky's...which we entered today.We had to pay $20 and register online. Upon entering the park you had to rip off the bottom half of the permit and drop it in a box. We keep the top half. If we are stopped by a Smoky's Ranger we have to present the permit or be fired. Also, you are not allowed to stay in the shelters if day/section hikers have reserved them. No camping in our tents either. We set up our tents tonight for fear of Norovirus in the shelter but with the plan to take them down around sunrise. Also, we crossed into Tennessee today! Our 3rd state. Scenery has changed for the better but TN has a law prohibiting privys. So they have designated ""privy areas"" with a shovel, woof!","Fontana Dam

Cheetah and I heard it directly next to our tents. We think it was either a deer or skunk. Didn't sound too much like a bear. Woke up around 6:45am and got moving bc we had a long day planned at 14.6 miles. I've become concerned about the small amount of calories I am consuming. I don't think my muscles are able to repair the damage caused by each day's miles. I ate nutella and a chocolate chip cliff bar for breakfast. Cheetah also gave me a Nunn which is a sort of energy protein drink. I like to chug whatever water is left in my nalgene (along with a propel or gatorade packet) before leaving camp. I think (know*) I need to eat more. Immediately began our hike uphill, as usual. After 3 miles the terrain drastically changed. The trail became extremely thin and deep, as if it were dug out. It looked like our calves had sunk into the golden wheat grass. There were also a lot of boulders. Which made sense bc our first big climb was Tennessee's Rocky Top! Cheetah and I hung out on top and enjoyed the amazing views. I ate a bag of peanut butter m&m's. A new friend summited shortly after us. his name is North Star and he is a high school guidance counselor from Vermont. Very nice, talkative guy. His daughter is 23 and an Athletic Assistant to the women's softball and soccer teams at UNC and his son is at syracuse and wants to become a sports caster. He hung with us for a bit but he has long legs and is in shape so he took off ahead.We left a bit before Corncob and Rhodo left camp so we also saw them at the top of Rocky Top. From there we had 10.6 hard miles to go. We went about 6 miles and made it to a shelter for lunch. There were 3 boys out for a spring break trip. 2 were from France and I was from Brazil. They said they study at a university in Chicago. Also, I forgot to mention that yesterday we ran into 3 seniors from the University of KY on spring break. Pretty cool to see some fellow UK fans! We ate lunch and got water to filter. I had ramen and a snickers bar. We left there at 3pm with 5.7 miles to Siler bald Shelter.These last miles were beyond tough. A lot of steep uphills. My arch and heel on my right foot is pretty bruised and needs rest. Luckily my blisters are not back but I feel new foot pain every once in a while. I needed motivation so I put in my earphones and listened to music. This helped for a bit. My stride lengthened and my spirit lifted. At about 0.5 from the shelter I started feeling desperate to get there. Extremely steep uphill climb. My feet hated me...and still do. Made it to the shelter and immediately decided to sleep inside even with the threat of Norovirus. Chance of rain and cold temperatures tomorrow so don't want to have to break down my tent in the rain. Tomorrow we plan on waking early and getting started by 7:30am. We climb Clingman's Dome which is the highest elevation on the trail at around 6,600 ft. Then our moms are meeting us at Newfound Gap. It will be a hard 12 mile day but we hope to get to the gap by 2-3pm.Met some new people tonight. Brothers from Maryland named Nomadic Fish and Chalk Dust, 28 & 24. Nice guys. Bandit showed up around 7pm. She has been on our same schedule for a couple days. She is probably the strongest person I have met so far. She is deaf and is solo hiking the trail. Super brave and really cool. North Star is here along with Tots and Little Tree. Good group, we are now around serious hikers who will most likely make it to Katahdin.

It was Rhodo and North Star's first ever night staying in a shelter and from the sound of things North Star couldn't get comfortable. I woke everyone up around 6:20am so we could get out of there around 7:30am. The shelters in the Smoky's are very picturesque. Made of stone with a fireplace on the inside. There is usually a tarp on the opening and a nice sheltered eating area. It was a bunked shelter on the inside so up to 14 people could squeeze in if need be. We had about 10 in the shelter and our group all slept up top with North Star, Nomadic Fish and Chalk Dust. Bandit, Tots, and Little Tree were on the bottom. I had a granola bar and should have eaten more but wanted to get started. I was very cold standing still and the other 3 weren't ready so I got moving. This was the first time setting out in the dark and alone. I really enjoyed the stillness around me. It was almost twilight so about 15 minutes in I was able to turn my headlamp off. It was very lightly misting so I had my rain jacket on. I had only a liter of water which meant my pack weight wasn't too much.Around the one mile mark Corncob caught up to me so I followed him to the next shelter which was only 1.7 miles away. At the mile mark we experienced our first big terrain change. Corncob passed through a tunnel of deep green hemlocks, the first we have seen. Immediately we began to be surrounded by all things green, moss, grass, hemlocks, even the thick fog had a slight green tint to it. It was wonderful. In the past, the fog amongst the stark, brown poplar-dense environment seemed so eerie. Fog among the hemlocks is less eerie and more calming. There is a sense of life with every step you take. More wildlife, everything is damp and the hemlock needles are exceptionally lush and soft to the touch.We came through the trees and encountered Double Springs Shelter at the 1.7 mark. We were immediately greeted by an ATC Ridgerunner named Chloe. She asked us if we had our Smoky's permit and where we stayed last night. She gave us a speel about how we shouldn't be afraid of the Norovirus in shelters and that the privy was clean. Afterward, I filled up my Smart Water bottle at the shelter's water source. This way, if I run out of my 1 liter in my camelback I have more I can filter. Cheetah and Rhodo showed up and Chloe gave them the same info.We all went on our way. This was one of the 1st times I lead the group. I am much more comfortable in the middle or as the caboose but today I was motivated by the thought of seeing mom. My body is beat up from the rough terrain and high mileage we have been pushing. My feet and diet are suffering the most. My right arch is bruised and my feet are swollen from the daily pounding. I also need to focus more on upping my caloric intake. I am not eating enough and still burning over 5,000 calories a day. I am going to re-add cheese and pita to my diet as well as whey protein.Climbing up Clingman's Dome was not too much of a difficulty. My fuel tank was on ""E"" though because my stomach was so empty. Beautiful surrounding the entirety of the climb. This made up for the awful views. We were literally in a cloud and whenever we could see past the trees it was a wall of thick white fog.We made it to the top and still couldn't see a thing. It still felt amazing to stand on the highest point of elevation on the trail. I have a moment almost every day where I suddenly realize what I am doing. I had this moment at the top of Clingman's Dome. Happiness, exhaustion, pride and determination all with a healthy dose of amazement.We headed downhill. There were 8 miles to Newfound Gap and we needed to be there by 2 or 3pm. We began walking 3mph but Corncob, Cheetah, and Rhodo needed a water source and had to stop to fill up. The was right after our lunch actually. Rewind to lunch: We sat next to a sign that told us Newfound was only 4.5 miles away. Rhode shared some of his Ramen with me bc I desperately needed a hot meal. It started raining on us and it got very cold. I can see how ppl become hypothermic in the Smoky's bc at 40 degrees and raining it chills your bones to stand still.While they got water I went on solo to keep warm. I was moving fast after a stomach full of ramen and the added inspiration of mothers with food. I made it to Indian Gap Road with 1.7 miles to Newfound Gap. I waited for the rest of the group. Cheetah has Verizon service so I called mom on her phone to see if they could make it up to Indian Gap Road. The idea was to throw our packs in their car and then slack pack the last 2 miles. Bad news: they had gone the wrong way for an hour and wouldn't be there until 5 or 6pm. It was 2:!5pm at the time. It then started pouring. Needless to say this lowered my mood quite a bit. We had woken up extra early and speed-hiked 10.3 miles to get there in time. I became very cold and had to continue on to warm up. We told them we would wait in the bathrooms for them at Newfound.Those last 2 miles I hiked the fastest I ever have. I basically ran over the mountain and Corncob accurately described it as ""hate-hiking."" This was good for me bc it allowed me to be alone and isolate my angry mood. I quickly realized it was inappropriate for me to be upset at my mom for anything. She is taking time out of her life to come down to see me. It's wonderful that she comes at all. I am lucky. I was able to remind myself of this during my ""hate-hike.""Coming into Newfound Gap was crazy. We were in the middle of a cloud in a wind storm. You'd could barely see the cars. On the last 100 yds we ran into Bandit's father who was w/ another man named Godspeed. Bandit was supposed to have arrived at 3pm to be picked up. I told them that she hadn't left the shelter before us and that she is slow and steady. They went on up the trail to try and gather more info. Godspeed said there was trail magic at the gap.I arrived to a petite woman handing out sandwiches, soda, and chips out of a huge white truck. Other hikers were around. It was freezing, raining, and crazily foggy. I grabbed some food, thanked her as best I could, and headed for the public restroom. Cheetah came up and I let her know where I would be.We set up shop in the bathroom. I was able to talk to my mom and they had arranged for a shuttle to pick us up and take us to the condo bc they were still running behind. We were picked up by Mark ($45 total). Very nice man w/ a long white ponytail. It was great seeing Rhodo and Corncob's faces when we reached the Gatlinburg main strip. They were amazed haha.We made it to the condo and were blown away. This place is a palace and so so so nice. We immediately found the jacuzzi tub and freaked out. Then, we all turned and saw ourselves in the mirror of the bathroom and freaked out even more. So dirty, so sunburnt. Our mom's arrived and I was so happy. I am so grateful to have her here. She envelopes me with a sense of ease and comfort. All I can remember after that is FOOD FOOD FOOD. I have missed bread, butter and sal the most. I had 6 pieces of focaccia with butter and salt. For dinner we had lasagna, salad, brownies, guacamole, veggie dip, deviled eggs, BREAD! Mom also brought everyone easter baskets, Mrs. Keegan brought wine! Then we did laundry and lounged.f Then sleep. Bed so comfy. Oh, we watched the UK game and we lost to IU  Sad but Truitt can visit me sooner now so I'm happy!","Siler Bald Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525928,"Day 28 - Zero day in Gatlinburg 3/20/16Woke up to the most amazing breakfast spread. Chocolate chip banana bread, bagels, muffins, eggs, fresh fruit, juice, etc. Gorged myself and then began more laundry and airing out the stuff in my bag. Lunch was another delicious spread w/ muenster cheese, turkey, lasagna, etc. Oh, the most delicious salted butter. I would toast focaccia and then put the butter on it and then sprinkle salt on the buttered bread.Went to Food City and mom paid which was really nice of her. Sorted through all my clothes and food. Decided to send home my heavy rain pants and balaclava. Added my shorts and tshirt to my clothes bag. Sprayed my clothes, tent and pack with Permethrin which kills ticks, mosquitos, etc. Then spent a majority of the afternoon updating my trail journal with Pride Prejudice playing in the background. Mom and I laid in bed while I typed away. She had brought her laptop which made everything so much easier. Went to a BBQ place for dinner and then we watched videos of Corncob and Rhodo on YouTube. Rhodo is a really good cellist and Corncob is a wonderful singer. Packed up my pack and then bed time.","Gatlinburg, TN

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525931,"Day 29 - Newfound Gap to Icewater Spring Shelter 3/21/16 2.8 milesAnother wonderful breakfast spread. I took a bath in the morning and actually shaved my armpits and legs (cut myself like it was my first time ever shaving). Started cleaning up and we eventually crammed into the car and went to the post office to bounce box some food to Hot Springs. Then on to Newfound Gap. We got to Sugarland Visitor Center and the road up to the top was closed bc of ice and snow. We stood in line to talk to the Rangers and they said no to our idea of road walking the 13 miles up to the gap. We had pretty much resigned ourselves to staying in Gatlinburg another night when they unexpectedly opened the road. Woohoo!The views were gorgeous. The temp dropped from 48 degrees to 22 degrees really fast. Got to Newfound Gap and it was a touristy circus. Mom and I had one last hug and a tearful goodbye. We ate lunch in the public restrooms and then set off in the 6-8 inches of snow. Beautiful, gorgeous views and snowy surroundings. I've never been in such wonderful settings. My arch and heel started experiencing a weird shooting pain. My right foot. I don't like this feeling. Got to the shelter around 2:30pm. Very cold out around 20 degrees. Dropped our packs and went to the JumpOff for views. I turned around early bc of foot pain. Then cold night. Very cold but thankful for full shelter. Beautiful views from shelter.","Newfound Gap

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525937,"Day 30 - Icewater Spring Shelter to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter 12.1 miles 3/22/1612.1 mile day today. So cold this morning. It was definitely down in the teens last night so I actually stayed in my sleeping bag until 7:30am. We crawled out into a clear but frigid morning. I had a granola bar and dark chocolate for breakfast. Also ""camel-ed up"" which means I chugged half a liter of water (w propel in it) before leaving. Snow still on the ground and it was icy at first. But the sun was up so the snow on he trail soon turned to soupy slush that was 2-4 inches deep. Our 1st climb took us to Charlie's Bunyon which was unbelievably beautiful. Corncob climbed to the ""second"" bunyon and I about crapped my pants for fear of him falling. Great picture though! Cheetah and I didn't stop for lunch until 2pm at mile 7.7 (Pecks Knob Shelter). There was a Brazilian couple there who study at University of Wisconsin. So many Wisconsin Spring Break hikers. We've already met 3 other groups. By this point my feet really started to get painful. Right arch and heel has shooting pain at times. Cheetah and I hiked the last bit to the shelter together in breathtaking surroundings. We talked about the sense of calm and safety being around spruce trees gave us. We also talked about how well we work together as a pair. We have been described as velcro (I'm the sharp side, she the soft). I can see that being true. More Wisconsin Spring Breakers at this shelter. Full house but I like it cause more people means warmer shelter. I'm in good spirits even though my feet are in poor shape. We are going to try for a 14.8 mile day tomorrow so I will wake up early and go slow and steady. A lot of it is downhill. We will be out of the Smoky's after tomorrow. New thru-hiker faces tonight...Mulligan, Headstand, Justin, etc. Justin in from Lexington and went to Henry Clay! He knows my dad's cousin's children, William and Elizabeth Burke! His name is Justin Graff (shoutout to the Burke family)! Such a small world. He graduated from Emory this year and will be going to either UK or Cinci med school. Crazy. Cold night again but cozy.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525945,"Day 31 - Tri-Corner Knob Shelter to Standing Bear Farm Hostel 3/23/16 18.4 milesToday was a crazy day that started out completely normal. Relatively warm night in the shelter. Everything re-froze overnight though so the slush turned back to ice. Jake and Tiffany, from Minnesota have been around us lately and they are hilarious. He is very talkative and I've never met someone who ""hates"" hiking the trail so much but make it sound so positive. He obviously loves being out here. We really enjoy their company. Cheetah and I started around 8:30am. My boots were cold but my fingers and toes warm up very fast once I get moving. Cheetah and I laugh about the drastic differences between her body temperature and my body temperature. She will be in her Patagonia mid-layer, both gloves and over-mits, plus two pairs of leggings and nothing else. I warm up so quickly and immediately get hot if I have too many layers on.Anyway, we begin a relatively easy uphill made extremely slow by slippery ice. Cheetah and I described it as walking like a drunk grandma. We have two ""canes"" and are slowly hobbling up the hill with no balance. One step forward, slide 2 inches backward. Beautiful vistas all day. Turned out to be a really warm day. Before an uphill to Cosby Knob Shelter we ran into a past AT thru-hiker named ChampagneJam. He had to get off the trail in Pennsylvania bc of his knees. He talked to us for a while and explained that he is day-hiking. He very kindly gave Cheetah and I each an orange. Fresh fruit is a luxury out here so we happily gobbled them down. We went on our way to Cosby Knob Shelter which was our planned lunch location. It felt good to hike for 7,7 miles with no serious breaks. Beautiful shelter. Corncob and Rhodo were there as well! Pushed on to Mt. Cammerer where I decided to change into my shorts and t-shirt while Corncob, Rhodo and Cheetah headed to the Lookout. I waited for about 45 minutes and then went on bc it was almost 4pm and we had 6 miles left. On my way down I ran into a local named Gary who was day hiking. He pointed out Max Patch to me in the distance. The others caught up to me while I was talking to Gary. From there we made for the Davenport Gap Shelter and didn't stop til we got there. Corncob and Rhodo got to the shelter first and there was a kid that was hiking for Spring Break who had the Norovirus and was actively vomiting. They said he threw up 9 times in the water source and immediately beside the shelter. We walked up and Rhodo yelled at us to turn around so we immediately turned around and flew down the extra mile downhill to the Davenport Gap Road. We were feeling dejected and realizing that we were going to have to walk 2 more miles to a hostel. We had officially left the Smokys. All of a sudden a pickup truck drove by and I stuck out my thumb jokingly. He actually stopped and gave us a ride down to I-40. Thank you Charlie! He wouldn't let us give him any money. After getting out we still had a mile to walk. We looked down and there were 2 people waving us down to trail magic they were putting on. Karma on our side. Sweet Magnolia and Short Bus (2015 AT thru hiker) made chili, grilled cheese, brownies, pancakes. Mulligan was there too. They were sweet hearts and told us they were staying at Standing Bear Farm Hostel. We started walking the final mile and a woman in a pickup truck stopped us and told us to hop in if we were going to the hostel. Yes! She dropped us off and Lumpy (guy with a beard, pipe and sun glasses) greeted us...""Arounnnnd hereee they call me Lumpyyy."" We decided to tent camp for $15 pp. Cheetah and I shared a tent so it was cheaper. This place was like a 1960's oasis. Outhouse, wash room with wash board, etc. All very quaint and cute. We all sat around the fire. Corncob found a guitar and sang. Went to bed around 11 or 12. Best sleep of the whole trail in Cheetah's tent. Crazy day. Loved it.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Woke up and Cheetah and Rhodo made eggs with cheese. Had a little bit with a tortilla. Then sat by the stream and soaked my feet in the ice cold water which I think will help my heel and right arch. Rhodo bough a pizza and ate that with the others for lunch. The workers there were really nice. One of them had 3 dogs and one of them would fetch rocks. Her name was Lulu, so crazy. Headed out around 12:30pm and immediately began a step 4.4 mile climb uphill. We powered up the hill in 2 hours and made it to our first large bald. Very cool but mostly weird. Then downhill for 2.5 and made it to a trashed shelter. Supposed to thunderstorm tonight so we want to selter it. Only other person here when we got here was Old Fox. A Chinese mountain climber from Scranton, PA (shoutout to Micheal Scott and others from The Office). He's turning 60 soon and quit his journalism job in NYC to come out here. Eventually 2 section hikers with a dog named Joe (the Boxer) came in and we made room for everyone in the shelter. 13 miles tomorrow and then 13 miles day after next into Hot Springs, NC! Ria's co-worker Jen is picking us up and letting us stay at her place in Asheville for 2 nights. SO AMAZING AND CAN'T WAIT! Goodnight!","Standing Bear Farm Hostel

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525976,"Day 33 - Groundhog Creek Shelter to Catpen Gap Campground 14.5 miles 3/25/16Today started off as pretty unremarkable. Corncob and Rhodo left the shelter at 5:30am to push a 23 mile day. That way, they will get to Hot Springs tomorrow morning with plenty of time to hang out. We left around 8:30am. Terrible, oppressive fog right out the gate. This kind of fog really weighs on my mood. You can not see where you are going 10 yds ahead and my glasses continuously fog up which is just the worst. On our 1st mile we ran into a 50 year old solo thru hiker named Brightside. He resides in California but from Maine. We chatted a bit then moved on. Legs were not moving as well. Or, maybe they were but I just felt like they weighed 50lbs. each. Not in great spirits and the temp dropped while Cheetah and I were about 6 miles away from Walnut Grove Shelter at this point so we picked up the pace. The wind picked up and I was about to resign myself to a hard day when we ran into two ATC volunteers who were painting the white blazes. So cool! They are the reason we actively go in the correct direction each day. They use a small paintbrush and tite bond white paint which comes out of what looks like a glue bottle. He had a stencil but didn't need to use it. They were both in their 60s or 70s. AT (wouldn't give us his real name) told us that he built Roaring Fork Shelter with his friend and trail mentor Howard MacDonald over 20 years ago...amazing stuff. While talking to the 2 volunteers, Brightside and Old Fox appeared and joined the conversation. We parted ways after thanking them for their hard work and went uphill to Max Patch Bald.My mood was completely lifted. It felt like a completely new day after talking to the volunteers. It truly is amazing how quickly everything changes out here (weather, terrain, mood, etc). Max Patch was surreal. The dense fog made the green bald seem as though it were something out of a movie. It was nice being with Brightside and Old Fox, they are so young at heart. Old Fox shared with us that he enjoys mountain climbing and that he has climbed a 17,000 foot mountain in China twice. Brightside married his wife in Alaska in his friend's living room. I love hearing little facts about people that make you smile. It's very easy to find the good in people out here. After Max Patch the skies cleared and we descended for a good while. We began running into more members of the Carolina Mountain Club who were maintaining the trail for all us hikers. We met a man named Lou who was hoeing the trail. He is 93 years old. Wow! We ate lunch w Brightside and Old Fox at Roaring Fork Shelter. We exchanged contact info which was nice. I told them that we should all carry AT info cards to exchange with each other. After lunch we parted ways as they sped onwards and we kept the same pace.Nice, level, gradual downhill. We came to a steepish root system and I stepped on the wrong place bc my foot immediately slipped and I couldn't stop myself. My pack's heaviness created a momentum that rolled me over and caused me to land hard on my rear end. I laid there for a second to make sure nothing was broken and then realized we could laugh bc I was fine and still alive. Cheetah and I started moving again and about one tenth of a mile in I used my trekking pole to point to a gnarly old tree. When I did, I suddenly noticed that about 5 inches of my pole were missing, whoops.We turned around and went back to the place that I fell. We found the end wedged firmly among the roots. Cheetah had a hard time prying it loose. Better my pole than my arm. I adjusted my poles to make them the same length and they work fine for the moment. I am going to get new ones for free from REI when I get the chance to call. Continued on at about 3mph which is good for us at this point. Went about a mile and was about to take another step when I looked down and noticed I was about to squash a snake. It was about 1 1/2 feet long and dusty brown/green. Snake didn't move. He was either too busy sunbathing on the trail to be bothered or giving me the deer in the headlights maneuver. Cheetah and I laughed and moved on.We reached Lemon Gap, woohoo go Mom's maiden name! There were little Easter eggs perched on top of the sign as trail magic for this weekend's Easter Sunday. Both Cheetah and I partook. Uphill until a bald and then immediately after was Walnut Grove Shelter. Old Fox was there! We were wanting to push on another mile and a half. It was 4pm at this point. A hiker named Ahab came up and Old Fox and he knew one another. Ahab convinced Old Fox to hike another 5 miles. We headed out and parted ways with Ahab who was staying at the shelter.Started our climb up Bluff Mountain. We reached our campsite after a half mile of uphill. Not too windy. Feet sore and body tire but feeling good. It was a beautiful night and Cheetah and I cooked and then she started the most amazing fire we've yet to see on the trail. It was nice being with just her at that camp site. We listened to music until the coals died down and stargazed until 10pm. Bedtime. It's been a good day.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525979,"I had a 4 day block of time where I just did not have the energy to write in my journal so this entry is devoted to catching back up. Each missed day is summarized in a paragraph below...Day 34 - Catpen Campground to Hot Springs/Asheville, NC 11.7 miles 3/26/16Cheetah's ex-coworker Jen picked us up in Hot Springs and drove us 45 mins to her beautiful home in Asheville, NC. We ordered from a restaurant called Homegrown and watched Villanova in the NCAA tournament. Corncob's cousin, Arcidiacano (sp?), is the start player on the team which was really fun to watch. Fell asleep in a real bed which was wonderful. Also, big shoutout to the Sunshine Gang (AT thru-hikers 2012). Before hitting Hot Springs, Cheetah and I came across their campsite where they had set up a couple days of trail magic. They were making chocolate chip pancakes, apple moon pies, clementines, bananas, etc. So so so tasty. It was fun talking to a couple named Tom and Jerry who now live in Damascus. Jerry is from Hilton Head Island and Tom is a big climber who has frequented Red River Gorge. Amazing group to run into.Day 35 - Zero day in Asheville, NC 3/27/16Jen made us eggs, bacon, and Rhodo let us eata lot of his REAL NYC boiled bagels. We did laundry and ate a lot of food for lunch. Jen drove us to downtown Asheville and we walked around. Ate at Early Girl Eatery then ice cream at Kilwins. Walked to Haris Teeter for resupply. Jen made us a huge dinner of a whole turkey, broccoli, carrots, bread. Then apple pie, salted caramel ice cream. Watched the Tar Heels play. Loved that Jen was a huge basketball fan. She was so passionate and it reminded me of UK fans. Went to bed in the comfiest bed on the trail.Day 36 - Hot Springs, NC to Pond Campsite 3/28/16 4.8 milesWe were dropped off at 9:30am in Hot Springs. Jen made us an amazing breakfast of homemade granola/oatmeal. She stewed apples, apricots and raisins to pour on top as a sort of syrup. FOOD SO GOOD. Dropped off at Bluff Mountain Outfitters. Post office run. Corncob headed to the mountain. We (Rhodo & Cheetah) started heading out but stopped at the Hot Springs resort. Took a mineral bath, walked back to town for lunch. Whoops. Hiked out at 4pm and went 5 miles to pond. Camped with Snap, Tank, Frodo, Captain Chuckles. Nice fire, beautiful stars. Day 37 - Pond Campsite to Jones Meadow Campsite 3/29/16 16.9 milesWoke up to a beautiful day. Captain Chuckles hiked with us to have a slower day. Met Palendrome. His trail name is introduced as a riddle asking us to figure out his real name which is actually a palendrome. I couldn't figure it out until I told a fellow hiker to which they immediately replied ""Mike Kim."" Andddd he was right, ugh. Snap lead all 8 of us up a 5 mile climb to a shelter. We had a 1.3 steep steep STEEP climb after that then less than a mile to our final destination. Cheetah took a 15 minute break with Rhodo and I powered on with Palendrome. He chatted me all the way up that mountain. I was dying but without his distraction it would have seemed impossible. Set up camp with Chuckles, Frodo and Tank again. Snap gets off the trail April 7th so we really want to spend time with him. Chuckles has a troll doll named By Lunchtime. The doll likes to sneak into people's sleeping bags, shoes, and surprise the unsuspecting hiker.Day 38 - Jones Meadow Campsite to Flint Mountain Shelter 3/30/16 11 milesNeeded to get to Erwin bc Corncob's amazing mother got us a hotel room which is seriously so nice. We have decided to do 11 miles then 8.8 then 2 miles to Sam's gap. We are being picked up by Eggman (a past AT thru hiker). This way we can maximize our time with Snap before he leaves and we can get to Erwin by Friday. We will be ""yellow blazing: about 27 miles of the trail by doing this. Had lunch at Jerry Cabin with new faces. Stretch (19 year old from South Florida), Riptide (Louisville 25 year old guy), Agua (Augusta GA, mid 20's, 2014 Southbounder). Thorasee and Freud (two girls hiking like us!) stopped for lunch as well. Snap and Rhodo were with us. We made it to 300 miles. Beautiful day. We spent 2 hours sunbathing. 6 more miles to Flint Mountain Shelter. Met Ron Jon. Tessla and Rash stopped for a bit before continuing on in the dark. Honeybuns was also there. He was at Top of Georgia with the name Weatherman at that time. Fun guy to be around as well. Very windy night.Day 39 - Flint Mountain Shelter to Hogback Ridge Shelter 3/31/16 8.8 milesNow caught up! Woke up this morning to crazy wind. Slept in till 9am bc we were only doing 9 miles. Headed out with Agua and Snap. Honeybuns behind us. Nice and flat for 3 miles the 3 miles uphill. Snap and Honeybuns veered off to the Hikers Paradise hostel for pizza and wifi. We continued on. Hard uphill for me today. Legs were very fatigued. We stopped for lunch at the very top with Agua. Definite rain today, we were just waiting for it. Continued downhill with only 3 miles to shelter. Lots more green sprouting up lately. Crazy winds blowing sideways. Rain stated, not bad though. Agua rejoined after a bathroom break and we pulled into the shelter around 4pm. Riptide and Ron Jon were already there. Shelter fits 6 and we crushed 8 people in. Gross weather for a it. Lots of new faces that I don't remember too well. Two Tennessee boys, one in college, one just out of college. The plan is to met Eggman at Sam's Gap at 10am and then heading to Uncle Johnny's to pick up my new, unbroken trekking poles! Then Corncob and Rhodo will pick us up for the hotel in Johnson City, Tennessee. 6:45pm. Really foggy. Everyone pretty much cooked dinner in their tent or in the shelter. The rain eventually stopped and Agua built a huge fire. The fog was so thick and creepy. Snap posed me for some cool long exposure shots with my red headlamp. Worried about mice tonight with the rain. Good day, ready to meet Mama Corncob and reunite with the boys tomorrow!","Catpen Gap Campground

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527024,"Day 40 - Hogback Ridge Shelter to Erwin, TN 2.4 miles 4/1/16Crazy night. Didn't sleep well. We were crammed into the shelter and then the rain started. Very loud but eventually I was able to get some sleep. Then around 5am I woke to the sound of Cheetah constantly pulling Velcro apart. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. A mouse was chewing on the wall beside her so loud that it sounded like a zipper being pulled up and down. At that point I yanked Cheetah onto my sleeping pad. I hate mice so much and they are my kryptonite on this trail. Somehow fell back asleep til around 7am. Agua was up and out of the shelter around 6:30am. He hiked slow, low mileage with us yesterday so I'm guessing he is trying to push some miles. We got moving around 7:30am. Snap slept in his tent bc he hit the shelter after it had filled up. He so easily puts a smile on people's faces. Also, his most recent photo was used by Appalachian Trials on their Instagram blog. We headed out of camp around 9am. This left us with 2.5 miles to hike in an hour. Easy terrain too. We left Riptide and Honeybuns back at the shelter.I had surprisingly fresh legs so I went a little faster than Cheetah and Snap to hit Sam's Gap right at 10am. Didn't want to miss Eggman. I followed Otter and Smalls (2 Tennessee boys) into the gap. Low and behold there was trail magic. An amazing man named Quiet Paul (2006 AT thru hiker, Carolina Mtn Club member) was cooking 6 eggs per person and half a plate of hashbrowns. So delicious. Cheetah and I both had a cold beer with our breakfast. Paul said he does trail magic every year for 10 days I that same spot. Cheetah and I have discussed annual trail magic plans after the 100 days. It's an amazing way to stay connected to your original hike while maintaining a dynamic relationship with the trail.Eggman was able to fit Snap and Riptide in the car as well and we headed to Erwin. It was a 30 min drive thru windy roads and beautiful landscape. We stopped at a gas station to repay Eggman for his ride with two 6 packs. Uncle Johnny's hostel was busy. It sits right on the Nolichucky River and it was fun to run into familiar faces (i.e. Green Hornet, Palendrome, etc). I picked up new trekking poles from REI and I think they're going to work. They are men's so they're not as skinny as mine but we shall see. I will send my broken poles back to REI so they can reimburse me. We were sitting in the sun when we saw Corncob and Rhodo roll up with Mama Corncob. She looks like one of his sisters and is amazing. She had a bunch of food so we gave Snap a hug and headed out with the crew. Johnson City is about 20 mins from Erwin and we are staying in the Comfort Suites. Mama Corncob went above and beyond (even this is an understatement). She booked Cheetah and I a suite. We have a jacuzzi tub, king size bed, and completely separate room with wet bar, couch, tv, desk, etc. Great real estate for laying out the stinky clothes and tents. Then she pulled out the food. Dear god I almost died...Brie, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, FRUIT, guacamole, beer, champagne. OMG. THEN Mama Corncob showed us the Walmart clothes she bought us so we didn't have to wear dirty clothes until laundry. Wow, overwhelmed and happy. She is amazing. She also brought face wash, shampoo, Epsom salt, razors, etc. I caught up a little on Trail Journals and then hung out with everyone after showers. We decided on Mediterranean. Great decision. I got dolma with lamb meat. So good. The place was caused Babylon and was BYOB so we enjoyed some wine. Brought some leftovers home. Got back around 10:30 and I finished up Trail Journals. Called Truitt who was a sleepy puppy. Then talked to Mr. Keegan via FaceTime with Cheetah! Exciting news! Mr. K is planning on riding his motorcycle down to Erwin on Sunday and then hiking with us on Monday. YES! Can't wait to see him  great day!","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527031,"Day 41 - Zero in Johnson City, TN 4/2/16 Stayed up late last night and watched Girls episodes on HBOgo. Slept like a rock until we woke up at 9:30am. Went down to breakfast. Riptide was there with his girlfriend (I'm guessing). After breakfast I did a couple chores. Aired out my pack and pre-washed my socks. It's gotten to the point where my liner socks are so gnarly that they become crunchy. It takes a pre-wash along with a regular wash to get them semi clean. The sink water that I washed them in turned brown, nice. Went to work sewing on two patches on my pack, an NOC patch and a GSMP patch. Took a break to soak our feet in an Epsom salt bath. All four of us sat on the edge of the jacuzzi and stuck our feet next to the jets...heavenly. My heels and arches were very happy. Finished with the patches and then we gathered our laundry and headed to the Wash-A-Rama. Fantastic time capsule of a laundromat. Definitely a little seedy, I mean the police were called while we were there, but I loved the flavor of the place. Stuck in 1960 with the pastel Wash-O-Matics. Aqua walls and then the best part were the Laundesign posters. They were definitely originals. 1960, NYC prints of great pen and ink caricatures. Cheetah and I ordered pizza to the laundromat while Corncob and Rhodo picked up food from the Mexican place across the street. We left there around 4pm for a small resupply at Food City. Of course I got too much food. I was on autopilot and forgot that Mr. Keegan will be here tomorrow evening with dehydrated meals for Cheetah and I to choose from. So amazing and kind of him. I am really excited to be eating a healthier diet for this section of the trip bc I think it will help with my fatigue and possibly foot pain. I will fill in what all he dehydrated once he arrives. I can tell Cheetah is extremely excited to see her dad. I peeked out of the bathroom today and she was just standing there smiling waiting for me to reappear just so she could tell me how happy she is to see him. So sweet.Back to the hotel (but not before a stop at McDonald's for McFlurrie's) and we watched the Villanova game. It was so cute, Mama Corncob brought us all a Villanova tshirt to wear so we could properly root on her nephew/Corncob's cousin, Ryan Arcidiacano. They won the game 95-46 I think which is amazing so he will be playing in the National Championship against UNC. WOW! The boys ran out for Chick-Fil-A while Cheetah and I took turns taking Epsom salt baths in the jacuzzi. We are chick-fil-a and watched O Brother Where Art Thou?Forgot to mention that right after Food City we went to an outfitters called Mahoney's which was really packed. Cool store. I got a smaller pair of ExOfficio underwear. I am a serious convert. Anytime I workout from now on I will be wearing them. Picked up a pair of Patagonia shorts, a sit-upon, and some awesome Patagonia shorts for Truitt's Birthday package. He turns 28 tomorrow! It's getting harder to be away from him the longer I'm out here but he is being incredibly supportive and understanding. I know this is a very selfish journey I am on. Night and happy birthday Truitt!!!","Erwin, TN

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528158,"Day 42 - Spivey Gap to Erwin, TN 4/3/16 11.1 miles (slack pack)9:30am wake up in order to grab breakfast from the hotel in time. Did a lot of small odds and ends at that point. Switched out ziplock bags, packed clothes, sorted things to be sent home. I have decided to send home one of my long sleeve synthetics, Nike shorts, a large pair of underwear and then extra journal pages. When I'm finished with a journal I send it home as a keepsake for myself. I also rip out the pages of my AWOL guide that we have already hiked. Minimal impact on weight but it's something. We cleaned up the room and left the hotel by 2pm. Stopped at Jimmy John's for lunch, thank you Mama Corncob!Headed to Uncle Johnny's and picked up 2 small backpacks to slackpack with. Mama Corncob was nice enough to take our full packs to the Mountain Inn in Erwin. This is where Cheetah and I are staying with her father. Rhodo and Corncob got a room with Mama Corncob as well. Corncob plans on slackpacking tomorrow as well, but southbound. This way, he will walk back to Erwin and still cover new miles, while also allowing him to watch the championship game on monday.I threw a raincoat, headlamp, liter of water, SPOT, and wallet in the backpack and then Mama Corncob drove us up to Spivey Gap and we started around 4pm. I was a little weary about doing 11.1 miles at 4pm and making it to Uncle Johnny's before sundown. I was wearing shorts and didn't want to be uncomfortably cold. Complete opposite experience from what I expected. We were practically moonwalking up the mountain. We were able to push ourselves and not get fatigued. 30-35lbs makes a huge difference. This is the first time I have felt in great shape. My legs felt powerful and I was able to keep my breath the entire time. I have been drinking alcohol a lot less and eating semi-healthy out here. The strenuous days of high mileage with added weight has whipped me into tip-top shape. I compared it to the constant struggle and fatigue of soccer two-a-days and then how you feel stepping out onto the field for the first game. You KNOW you're in shape. Corncob and I walked together for a while which was nice. We discussed his potential psychology career after the trail and his concerns/expectations. I think he would make. Great therapist. Once Cheetah and Rhodo caught up we decided to run for a bit. We probably trail ran for a total of 2 miles. Once again, this felt amazing to do. In the past, seeing trail runners pass me made me question their sanity, but when you feel good it is an amazing experience. You are forced to become attached to the ground where you are placing your next foot. Are you able to decide quicker than your next footfall? It was truly fun. We hit the shelter about one and a half hours after we started. There we met Red and Blue along with a couple other hikers, Bear Bag, Sneaky Pete, etc. Quieter group than we are used to but all nice.Around the end of the hike we began to glimpse fantastic views of Erwin and the Nolichucky River. What a beautiful area. After this, I broke off from the group and continued at a light run. Hard on my knees and feet but the rest of my body felt good. I was met at the end of the trail by Uncle Johnny's huge blind dog, Jerry Garcia. He led me to the hostel and right into the big bear hug of Tom Keegan, Cheetahs dad. He had been hanging out on the front porch with Jay and Otter, sharing a beer. After loving on Cheetah and showering her with a father's kisses, we hopped in the car and drove the mile and a half to Mountain Inn. There was a feast of no small size waiting for us. All I can say is holy shit we are spoiled!Gazpacho, crab and lobster bisque, clam chowder, shrimp, clams, oysters, king crab, torta, hearts of palm, Cabernet Sauvignon, old fashioned's, and a homemade raspberry cheesecake. Tom drove back to the hostel to pick up a thru-hiker named Jay so that he could also enjoy the spread. They had worked it that Tom purchases his shrimp from Jay's Godfather. Such a small world. We feasted in the lobby of the Mountain Inn. So decadent. Put on some Ray Charles and laughed the night away. The food was the main event. Mama Corncob, Corncob, Rhodo, Jay, Tom, Cheetah, and I chewed down til 11:30pm. We cleaned up and headed to our rooms. Cheetah helped her dad put together his pick for tomorrow. His pack is pretty cool with its external frame. He also had his fathers poncho from WWII that he wore in the Philippines. Love it! We are finally getting to bed. Around 1am.","Spivey Gap

Cheetah told me that when she wakes up at home she and her mom make really quiet squeaky noises to one another. So we have started doing this to each other whenever we wake up and it makes me laugh everytime. Cheetah showered and we had breakfast at the hotel. Cheetahs brother had sent a jar of REAL maple syrup from Wisconsin so we all shared this on the waffles which of course was delicious.Tom brought up that he would just keep the hotel room for another night, so we wouldn't have to pack up all the dehydrated food he brought. Then we would get a shuttle from Indian Grave Gap at 9am tomorrow morning and divvy up the food then. We agreed so we will be back in Erwin tomorrow morning for a bit before he drives us back to the gap and we will begin our day from there. I'm thinking we will be doing a 9 mile day.Before heading back to Uncle Johnny's Tom drove us to the downtown area of Erwin so that I could ship my trekking poles back to REI. The broken ones, not the new ones. We got to Uncle Johnny's and saw Honeybuns along with a couple hikers from our slack pack day. Honeybuns informed us of some trail magic that's happening at Indian Gap tomorrow so we may be lucky enough to run into it when we're dropped back off. From there Rhodo, Cheetah, Tom and I started hiking. Crossed the Nolichucky River and then the train tracks. Nice and flat. Beautiful terrain. It reminded me of the first 3 miles in GA. Wide pine-needle covered trail, walking beside a large stream strewn with moss covered boulders. Absolutely perfect weather at 65 degrees and sunny. For lunch we stopped and ate on some of the boulders. I iced my right arch and heel in the freezing water. From there we hiked uphill. Hard incline. Major props to Tom for conquering today's mileage. This was tough terrain.We stopped at the first shelter for a break and Freud and Farasi were there. I really like these girls. They are 24 and 25 and from GA. They have a cool story of how they met but I'm getting tired so I'll leave it for another entry. We ate crab legs and then got moving. I was alone on nice flat trail for a while so I called Truitt and then called Andi. She got her brace off! (Recently tore ACL). Glad I got to check in with her. I miss our weekly phone calls.We all made it to the campsite by the gap and we set up shop. Farasi and Freud were already here. Made a fire, food, a little rain but not much. Tom made hot dogs. Nodding off. Having Tom here makes me excited for my dad to visit. Night!","Erwin, TN

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528304,"Day 44 - Indian Grave Gap to Beauty Spot Campsite 4/5/16 2.3 milesWoke up and the temperature was around 38 degrees. Tom, Cheetah, and I went down to the road to wait for the shuttle to Uncle Johnny's ($27). It took about 20 minutes down a windy road. At Uncle Johnny's I bought a new Platypus dirty bag to filter my water from. The one that came with my Sawyer started to come apart at the nozzle. I also purchased an ultra-sil waterproof 18L Granite Gear food bag. RIP to Rusty Bridge's cheese wiz explosion Sea to Summit food bag.Headed back to Mountain Inn and the meal prep a la Tom Keegan began. He had dehydrated yams, lentils, mushrooms, green peppers, shallots, garlic, onion, carrots, olives, cranberries, papaya, cherries, apples, pineapple, wasabi peas, sunflower seeds. He also brought about 10 different kinds of spices. Cheetah and Tom prepared bags from the vacuum sealer and then Cheetah and I went through everything and created our own meals. After a meal was created Tom would vacuum seal the meal. Each meal weighed next to nothing. An example of a meal j made is: soba noodles, lentils, green peppers, shallots, onions, garlic, mushroom, and Thai teriyaki seasoning. We made more meals than we needed and created a bounce box for Damascus. Seriously amazing. He is too good to us. He is planning on sending pre-made meals once we let him know what works. After packing up all the food I ran over to the gas station for a new journal bc I go thru them so fast. Jumped into the car and went to Uncle Johnny's...again! Haha. We dropped off a bunch of food and I got a sticker for my Nalgene bottle. Then post office. I sent Truitt his bday present, Cheetah and I sent a letter to Mama Corncob in Hawaii.Tom drove us up to Indian Grave Gap and there we ran into Bear Bag and Nomad. Both older than 40 I'd say but sometimes it's hard to tell out here. Bear Bag is from Fayetteville, NC and Nomad is a Floridian who hiked with Frodo for a bit in the beginning. Mama Corncob and Corncob drove up with Coconut in the backseat. Coconut started with us on the 22nd back when his name was San Antonio. He is quiet but very friendly. It was nice being with another hiker who had experienced the same time frame as us. His name is Coconut bc he spilled coconut oil all in his backpack. Mama Corncob brought up the rest of the beer, fruit, etc and gave Nomad, Bear Bag and Coconut some trail magic. Cheetah and I started up the mountain. We hiked for two miles. We felt great and our legs were moving really fast. I think it's bc we had just had such a positive experience with Cheetah's dad and Corncob's mom. It was a sad goodbye. I know it was hard for both Cheetah and Tom to leave each other. She was in good spirits once we got going though. His visit definitely rejuvenated both of us.We got to Beauty Spot which was an amazing bald with beautiful views. Right after the bald we ran into a campsite with Rhodo, Honeybuns, Snap and Corncob. We had only gone 2.4 miles but they wanted us to stay there for the evening. This is the 1st time Cheetah and I have had conflicting choices on what to do. I wanted to continue on but Cheetah wanted to stay. In the end we stayed. Nomad and Bear Bag showed up along with a 19 year old NH girl named Mambo. A guy named Miles also showed up. Big fire and then we headed up to the bald for the sunset. Simply gorgeous. Layers upon layers of mountain ridges. Fiery oil-painting of a sunset. I sat in silence for the entirety of the sunset. Then the stars came out. Before that Snap set up a hilarious photo shoot of Honeybuns with the last of the light behind him. I died laughing. Built a fire on the bald and now I'm sitting here with Corncob, Honeybuns, Cheetah, Rhodo, and Snap. Going to walk back to the campsite soon.","Indian Grave Gap

Cheetah and I got out of camp at 8am. 38 degrees, probably 28 degrees windchill. We were 1st ones out of camp. Super windy but beautiful frigid sunny morning. Unaka Mountain was a favorite of mine. Around the summit a dense spruce forest spread in all directions. The light was mesmerizing. Cheetah and I stopped and appreciated the surroundings. This was a place to saunter...in the words of Journeyman (who we saw yesterday at Uncle Johnny's!!!!) 4.5 miles in 2 hours. It was just us today. We got to the 1st shelter. We stretched and I took a poo, hehe. Had to use the shovel. 3 more miles and there was trail magic. A trash bag at a parking lot. Cheetah and I shared a clementine and we emptied our garbage (it's the little things). At 2pm we stopped in a grass clearing for lunch. A section hiking Canadian couple was there and we made small talk. This is when the sun went away. 2pm and only 4.7 miles left of a 16 mile day. We did good. We are such a good pair. We listen to each other and I would say we share a sort of kinship. We know each other. She gets me and I get her. Finished our hike. Last mile was hard but we are first ppl to shelter. Possible rain tonight so we set up shop inside. Ppl began to arrive about an hour after us...Mambo, Snap, Honeybuns, Corncob, Rhodo, Nomad, Optimistic Dreamer, etc. Full house, new faces.

Had to wear ear phones for half the night. Also there was a torrential downpour with crazy wind. I said a little prayer for everyone in a tent. Luckily the rain had stopped by morning. Wind hadn't stopped though. We got up at 6:45 and left right at 8am. I felt really good, legs were moving well and not fatigued. I definitely think the healthy dinner helped me this morning. Cheetah wasn't feeling great. She said she was feeling sluggish. The first climb was up Little Rock Knob and it was beautiful. Snap hiked with us for a bit but we took a bathroom break. On the way down the knob I got service so I called Truitt bc he's leaving for San Francisco for a couple days. I really miss him. I am looking forward to his visit. Then I called my dad. He was thinking of coming down tomorrow with John Carlin and hiking with us for a couple days. It's supposed to be horrible weather. -3 degree wind chill apparently. Also the terrain isn't the most interesting. Later in the day I called and let him know. He's coming weekend after next. I think he'll enjoy VA more anyway. Also happy bday Nana!!!After calling everyone we hit the beginning of Roan Mountain uphill (5.2 miles). Cheetah and I stopped for breakfast so Snap went on. Did my business and then ate some dried fruit. Mambo came up and joined us for a mid-morning snack. We 3 started uphill. It was nice having Mambo there bc we were all distracted by conversation. Once we hit the peak before Ash Gap everything changed for the better. We passed over the frost line and entered fantastical terrain. Huge boulders covered in mint and orange moss were the anchors to gnarled wind batteries trees. The wind was chilling and strong. Up to 35mph winds. Once we went down into Ash Gap I felt as though we had entered a fairytale. Everything was tinted green around us. The path was a snake of black earth sunken about a foot from the mint grass surrounding us. Lichen covered trees with no leaves stood as sentries to a gateway of spruces on Roan Mountain. We ascended into the spruce and Cheetah and I truly began to saunter in the true sense of the word. We were in awe. So my beauty and we were in the middle of it. We walked upwards like this for an hour. Reached the top and discovered a large meadow covered in ice. This used to be where a hotel stood in the 1800s. Nothing remained but the chimney. Mambo caught back up with us and we headed toward the shelter for lunch. So cold at this point. Must have been about 25 degrees with a colder windchill. Cheetah and I ate a quick lunch and got out of there as Rhodo, Honeybuns, and Corncob walked in to join Mambo. Raced down the mountain bc we know that lower elevation means warmer temps. Ran into an older couple from Pennsylvania who were section hikers. Made it to Carver Gap where Snap was waiting for us. We have been hiking in the Pisgah National Forest and Cherokee National Forest. Mambo joined us and we began the last 6 miles of the day. We ascended 3 balds before a big downhill. So so so very windy and sideways snow. 50 mph winds. Cheetah was physically blown off a rock. Around 13 miles mark my feet really began to hurt. Each step was a hardship. Cheetah said she could notice me wincing. I think my foot has finally changed after almost 400 miles of hard hiking. It's splaying more and I think that my arches have lowered a bit. I am planning on getting new shoes in Damascus that are trail runners. We made it to the shelter that is 1.9 miles from Overmountain Shelter.Cheetah and Snap took a break but Mambo went ahead. I took off about 20 mins before Cheetah and Snap. I put on music and felt good despite my foot pain. Today has been a great day. I got to the shelter sign and saw Mambo. We walked to the shelter together. It's one of the coolest ones on the trail. A repurposed barn that looks out over an amazing view. 4 section hikers already here. Ate dinner and watched the snow fall. Around 6pm the mass exodus of 20+ mile hikers rolled in. Red, Blue, and a bunch of other white men with beards, ha. Supposed to be so cold tomorrow so we booked a room in Newland, TN. 10 miles tomorrow!","Clude Smith Shelter

I had to pull my mid layer into my sleeping bag with me for added warmth. Not great sleep but pretty good. I did not hear a single mouse but I did hear a coyote or coyotes howling most of the night. Probably celebrating a kill. There were also 2 hikers that showed up around 9pm at night. Woof, no thanks. I'll pass hiking at night in the snow. Got going around 9am to a beautiful cold day. Someone said it was supposed to rain but the skies were bright blue. Immediate uphill and over amazing balds. It was crazy watching the hikers slowly climb up the bald ahead of us. They would turn into tiny moving ants silhouetted by the bright sky as they moved upward. Tan mountain, black slice of path, bright blue sky. Our next big climb was Big Hump. It was a mile and a half climb uphill and you could see your destination the entire time. One of the coolest parts was having a 360 degree view once at the top. Cheetah did a headstand and we took a couple pictures then headed downhill for the next five miles. The Roan Highlands are absolutely amazing. I think I told Cheetah ten times that I'm coming back to hike this section. Downhill was pretty uneventful. We crossed the Doll Flats and we were able to see Elk Park, NC in the valley. Lots of Christmas tree farms. At the edge of the flats we were greeted by a sign, ""Leaving NC."" Our 2nd state is complete! Now we have a couple more days in TN before VA.Made it to 19E and we were picked up by the owner of the Shady Lawn Lodge. 7 of us piled into his truck and rode 7 miles into town. Mambo, Cheetah and I shared a room while Honeybuns, Snap, Corncob, and Rhodo shared one. I was happy to be in a room with just girls for once. Filled up at the Mason Jar for lunch and then showers, washed clothes, grocery, McFlurry, dinner. The guys came into our room and we watched A Walk in the Woods. Pretty comical. Not similar to my experience at all. Then bed. Honeybuns is sick so he's been sleeping this whole time.","OverMountain Shelter

Very cold and windy but clear. We got started and immediately saw a lot of signs about vandalism on that part of the trail. Apparently a lot of the trail that runs thru the northern section of TN was taken by imminent domain. We have seen a lot of memorials marking family land that had to be given up. Land that had been in families for generations. The landscape was not very memorable. We had a difficult up that went on a bald and it us a view of Roan Highlands. Cheetah sat down to take it all in. Went on and we came across Jones Falls which was gorgeous. There we met up with Rhodo, Mambo, Snap, Red and Blue. We sat down and had a fantastic lunch. I really enjoy the new company of Red and Blue. The falls were amazing. The sun was peaking over right at the top which helped with the cold. We ground out another 6 miles that were uneventful all except for being with Snap. We entertained ourselves with different versions of Queen songs. There's a running joke that Cheetah left Snap for dead so of course we incorporated that into our lyrics.At the end of our day we made it to the footbridge at Laurel Fork. Luckily someone had placed an arrow pointing out the side trail to Vango Hostel, owned by Scottie (4,000 miles of hiking). We were still anxious about the trail actually leading us to the correct location. It was supposed to only be .2 off the trail but it was more like a half mile. Finally, I saw a confederate flag and thought we were either coming upon private property or the hostel. Luckily, it was the hostel. Cheetah and I had reserved bunks but Scottie had given our spots to Red and Blue. Scottie very generously gave Cheetah and I the private heated room. It was wonderful we/Cheetah needed after an emotional day. Big double bed, tv with VHS, carpet, etc. We cooked a pizza then said goodnight to everyone in the bunkhouse at 8:30pm. Red was playing guitar and it was very soothing listening to him, great voice (apparently he writes all his own stuff). Cheetah and I agreed we could listen to him all night. Cheetah and I headed upstairs and picked out When Harry Met Sally to watch. It was fantastic to watch such a feel good movie. Fell asleep happy.","Newland, NC

It was a day of puds, which are many ""small"" ups and downs. I am in the middle of my period so I am more fatigued than usual. My eyes are heavy and my mouth is dry.I got my ass handed to me on all the puds. We stopped at Moreland Gap Shelter for a long lunch and met River. He was fun to talk to. From Vancouver area of Canada and very funny. Got over the last two humps and then downhill (long) to Laurel Falls area. We kept playing cat and mouse with a section hiker named Mike. He's a reporter...his wife later told us that he is a Pulitzer Prize winner, wow!Finally got to Laurel River and it was beautiful. Large rock faces and cool stone steps down to the falls (300 of them). The falls were huge. We followed the river for a while. I think we missed the sign for the shelter. We found an amazing campsite right by the river and set up shop. It was just Cheetah, Corncob and Snap. Ate, started a fire, and then I climbed into my tent.Talked to dad on the phone for about an hour. I am really excited for him to come hike with us. He's coming April 22 thru the 24th and bringing John Carlin...possibly Joe Grider! I gave him a lot of tips and told him to be very judicious when picking out shoes.

Ughhh. Around 6am I got the motivation to get my bear bag down so I could take Tylenol and ibuprofen. It eventually kicked in so I felt better but very tired so slept in til 8:30am. Good morning. The campsite was amazing and being right on the water was so nice. Listened to a lot of Ray Charles while getting ready. Boosted my mood for sure. Gorgeous day. Sunny and 65 degrees. Went up 3 miles right away to the Pond Flats. On the way up we ran into two middle-aged women with the same exact packs as us. They were Deb and Bangles. They told us they were old college buddies from Georgetown University. I was behind Deb for a by and found out that she is an attorney for a corporation. She lives in Florida now. We stopped and took a break with them a mile from the top. It was great to talk with them, very fun ladies. They are slackpacking the entire trail so Bangle's husband is driving a trailer to a predetermined spot each day. So jealous. Cheetah and I carried on up the mountain and over. Interesting bc it is almost exactly an equilateral triangle as far as grade and mileage. On the other side it descended into Watauga Lake where there was a beautiful beach. Farasi, Freud, Snap and Corncob were there.We laid there for about 2 hours in the sun. Cheetah took her clothes off and jumped in. I just soaked my feet for a bit. While Cheetah ate lunch I took a 45 minute nap on the picnic bench. The sun felt wonderful. We finally convinced ourselves to get going around 3pm. We had 9 miles to go, 6 of which were hard uphill. The first 3 miles were around the lake which was beautiful scenery. The trail had a lot of broken glass from beer bottles unfortunately. I imagine this is a fun part of the trail for locals to come and party. I was tired but my legs were moving well. Was a little ahead of Cheetah, Corncob, and Snap. Once I hit the dam I turned around and saw Snap and Cheetah taking pictures so I pushed ahead thinking they would catch up soon. Immediate steep uphill. I set I my mind that I had 6 definite miles of it. I put in my earphones and turned on some rap music and got going. I refused to stop until I made it to the stream 1.7 miles from the shelter. I felt good on the main uphill but my energy petered out on the puds that took me on a roller coaster ride of the ridge. I finally came upon a couple tents and realized I was at the stream. Freud and Farasj were still there filtering water. I must have booked it bc they had left an hour and a half before me. There was a group of three flip floppers there as well and they were asking about Cheetah and I. They had heard we were from KY. Two older gentlemen that were uncles to a 23 year old girl. The girl was from KY (Greyhound). They had started south of the Shenandoahs and are headed south for Springer. Once they hit Springer they will start north to Katahdin from there initial starting point in VA. Greyhound is from Union, KY, wow! Same town as Cheetah. She also had gone to Georgetown College and know Madelyn Brown and Finnja Ramke. Such a small world. Corncob, Cheetah and Snap showed up about 25 minutes later. Corncob went on to get the last spot on the shelter. I headed out a little after to get there and set up my tent before it started raining. I was so worried I started running for a bit. Luckily no rain.Got to camp and set up. Good group. Otter and Smalls from TN, Blue and Cap'n Red from St. Louis, Freud and Farasi from GA, T from Asheville, Mambo, Rhodo, Snap, Corncob, Elusive, etc. Small fire and then bed. Rain started around midnight.","Laurel Falls Campsite

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529373,"Day 51 - Vandeventer Shelter to Low Gap Campsite 17.9 miles 4/12/16Woke up to rain falling on my tent. Such a soothing feeling to be in your tent when it's raining. About 55 degrees outside so not bad. We took our time to get going bc of the rain and we weren't exactly set on an 18 mile day yet. One of the shelters was 15 miles from us so that was also an option. Got going at 11am. Cap'n Red was still asleep in his tent which was funny bc Blue told us that he was wanting to push a 24 mile day. Blue was up and ready with us and just shaking his head and laughing. Even if they get going at 1pm I bet they'd still push through, they're not averse to night hiking. It was foggy and spitting rain. I had my shorts on so that kept me moving. I sent my rain pants home after the Smokies due to their weight and I haven't had a problem with not having them yet. Now that it's warmer it's easier to just wear shorts and not worry with wet pants. We did 5 miles in no time and got to the next shelter. Had a short 15 minute break and got moving to a road crossing 5 miles from there. We heard there's trail magic there and were thinking of eating lunch there. The sun finally came out and the terrain was so nice. We got to the trail magic around 4pm.There were mountain dews, dr peppers, Sierra mists, star crunches, tuna, safety equipment, etc. While we were there the trail Angels came to refill it and ""made"" us take more food. Cheetah and I both had 2 sodas so we were bouncing off the walls. Got moving around 5pm with 6 miles left. We went across grazing land and it was gorgeous green rolling fields that were fenced in. The sun was at the perfect angle so you felt as if you were in a movie. Corncob went on ahead. Cheetah and I finally got to the shelter at 15 miles. I consulted with Cheetah and we decided to hit the 18 miles we had originally intended to do. Just a couple of puds between us and the campsite. Snap was also ahead of us. We saw T and Elusive at the shelter and said hello. The last three miles weren't bad. I had to do my business but wanted to hold it until we got there bc the sun was on its way down. Also we were in bad trail for any bathroom shenanigans.Got to camp and Snap and Corncob were there. There was a piped spring down by the road and we ran around the curve of the road to catch the most beautiful gold and magenta sunset. It was Snap, Cheetah, and myself. We filtered water and then set up camp in the dark. Dinner, then bed.","Vandeventer Shelter

Jelly Ankles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529375,"Day 52 - Low Gap to Damascus, VA 15.2 miles 4/13/16Great night's sleep. I talked to Cheetah and she said around midnight she heard a car crash down on the road, broken glass then a guy shouting. I had earphones in so thank god I didn't hear it or else I would've been paranoid the entire night. Heard some coyotes but that's about it. Cooler morning but BEAUTIFUL day. About 2 miles in (we started at 7am) we ran into Rhodo and a guy named Jester. Rhodo was having breakfast. Apparently, Cap'n Red and Blue had stayed there as well. They pushed 20 miles starting at 12:30pm, woof! They hiked until 11:30pm.Kept going, our plan was to have breakfast at Abingdon Gap Shelter, which was about 5 miles from where we started. Great terrain and Cheetah and I occupied ourselves by talking the entire time. She told me about Betsy and Brian and I am probably more excited for them to get married than anyone else, ha. I'm so invested, yet I've met them only once! Ran into Abingdon Shelter and Jester was there having breakfast as well. From Minnesota but lived in Guatemala for the past four years. He's hiking to raise money for 2 different charities. One is called Ser Niña which is a charity advocating women's empowerment in Guatemala. Amazing! He went on and we followed about 20 mins later with Rhodo. Terrain was great the the day beautiful but our bodies are maxed out. Our legs were only moving out of muscle memory. At one point we were only 3 miles from Damascus and Cheetah had to stop bc her feet were so painful. She gets upset with herself for feeling the pain and getting emotional about it. I told her that if she doesn't let it out then she will go crazy out here. It's not safe to let yourself become all bottled up. You must haves release of some sort. You're allowed to cry and be in pain and hate your life sometimes. It's easy to try and be stoic about these things but it never works out how it should.We sat together for a while and collected our emotions. The last three miles were probably the easiest as far as terrain but they were our hardest for or bodies. Our bodies needed a break. My legs felt like absolute jelly. I was closing my eyes while walking. We saw the town from up above and we still weren't motivated. Could've rolled down the hill. We made it thoughThere is a welcome sign and we fell in front of it. Still had half a mile of town walking. On the way we were stopped by an 89 year old man named Wilford Corbin. He is a trail maintainer and even had an Appalachian trail belt buckle on. He is from Franklin, NC and told us a story about his high school graduation ring. He saw my Nana's that I wear and it made him think of the story, they both graduated in 1945! He was at Pearl Harbor in 1948 and he was playing with his ring while looking at the remnants of The Arizona. The ring fell in the ocean and he said Good Riddance. A guy next to him asked what he dropped and Corbin told him it was his high school ring. The guy asked where Corbin was from and he told him Franklin, NC. The guy said ""no kidding, me too."" They looked at each other and realized that they were each other's cousin! Corbin hadn't seen his cousin since he he got on a bus and went to war. Wow!Kept stumbling toward town. Picked up our mail drops, thank you parents! Headed for a taco joint called Hey Joe's. Scarfed that down then went to Woodchuck Hostel. We however and set our stuff up on memory foam mattresses. They also have a huge teepee in the backyard. Hopped in the shuttle for Food City at 5 and got stuff to make veggie stir fry. Had a pint of Ben and Jerrys. Made stir fry. Went to bed. Everyone is here...Shrink, Red, Blue, Smalls, Otter, Snap, Rhodo, Corncob, etc. Good group and Woodchuck is amazing. From North Dakota and hiked the AT. Moved to Damascus to start this hostel. So nice. Bed.","Low Gap Campsite
