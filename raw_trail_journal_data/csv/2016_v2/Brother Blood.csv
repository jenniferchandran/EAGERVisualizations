Brother Blood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496113,"It was my second section hike, in 2013, that I stopped asking thru-hikers why they were doing it. I gave up on the ridiculous notion that everyone on the trail had some deep, profound, personal reason to be making this pilgrimage. But I realized then that most of us just love the woods, and love hiking. So now as I tell people that i too will be making the same pilgrimage, it's my turn to answer the endless queries of Why??But give me time, I'll come up with some good (made up) stories to satisfy people's expectations of why I would do such a thing.Any ideas???",,Why do this anyway?,"May 22, Fri",0

Brother Blood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503940,"I made one small, very small concession to my wife. That I would carry a satellite tracking/emergency beacon on my hike. I ordered the Delorme InReach which will allow me to send messages to her, regardless of cell coverage. It will also allow anyone I allow, to track my progress along the trail. The hardest part will be avoiding the temptation to slip the device into a westbound car of people I may meet along the way. The look on her face when she sees the beacon making a beeline for Nebraska would be priceless !!!I'll be doing some backpacking this summer, and fall, and winter, but won't call them ""practice hikes,"" or ""training hikes,"" it will just be fun to be out in the woods.The idea of ""training"" to hike 2,186 miles to me is absurd.

It's because I am not preparing...yet. This week I will start dehydrating food, listing possible mail drops and deciding what final gear I need to purchase. Best piece of gear I received at Christmas was a 12 oz. flask with the inscription ""AT Thru-Hike 2016."" Just to have a little something to help on cold nights, or share with a fellow hiker in need. I will start to get in better shape. I hope to be able to jog two miles at a decent pace, and be able to hike 10 miles with 30 pounds on my back on the A.T. Being that the famed ""Roller Coaster"" of Virginia is only about an hour and a half away, I have a great training ground.

She was able to sleep on the train, I wasn't. I was able to get about a 30 minute nap.
I met Maverick, Silver Fox, and Sheryl at the Gainesville, GA train station and we made room for Taylor and crammed into a small hatchback, on our way to breakfast, then the trail.
Despite several voices, including Silver Fox, advising me not to do the 604 stairs up Amicocola Falls, I and my pack made the climb. So glad I did, a beautiful way to start the journey.
Finished 8.8 mile Approach Trail, and saw my first blaze!

As usual,he had the coffee made.Weather great, and I was only feeling the sunburn from yesterday a tiny bit. Stopped 6 miles in at Hawk Mt Shelter for lunch. Met Captain Guts, who +uickly broke the social rule of not discussing politics. But we agreed on alot so I naturally liked him. Former Marine as well.Met Molasses, you can bet how she got the name. And she was packing about 55 pounds of gear, hopefully she'll correct that and at least speed up to syrup speed. Enjoyed seeing WOK Man again. Last two miles were tough for me, and I was told Maverick as well. Damn, Silver Fox is in great shape. Sheryl just keeps racking up miles, and is loving her time with all the hikers.

I learned the first night that Maverick was battling a fairly acute resperatory infection, or something similar. Yet, depite spending a fair amount of time hacking instead of sleeping, he kept his word to see me off on my journey. I won't forget that Maverick!!! You're Awesome !We hit Woody's Gap around noon, and we greetedby a large bus, of the ""peacemakers,"" who shared trail magic. They were part of group called the 12 Tribes and seemed a little cultish. Who knows??It's here we cirst saw hikers quit, and actually offer their gear to anyone who wanted it.

Maverick and Sheryl headed to the Hiker Hostel yesterday, so it was just me and Silver Fox to take on Blood Mountain. Despite the warnings of a treacherous climb, it wasn't that bad at all. As usual Silver Fox was well ahead, as I hiked with ""Redneck,"" a German, big-city liberal, who said he got a good Southern 'redneck' (sunburn) on the first day. So I nicknamed him ""Redneck.""We saw Silver Fox' trekking poles leaning on the sign for the Woods Hole Shelter about halfway up the mountain, so we stopped at the shelter where Silver Fox, was making coffee. He's awesome !!We got to the summit without much problem as the rain was ready to come. The Blood Mountain Shelter at the summit is a beautiful shelter, but it was to foggy to enjoy any view. With the rain approaching, Silver Fox donned a yellow rain suit that made him look like he was hiking into a reactor at Three Mile Island rather than the AT.The descent was rocky, but not bad despite blowing winds and rain. And soon we at arrived at the first real landmark on the AT, Mountain Crossings Outfitter.It was there I met a young lady, later known as ""Pebbles."" 15- years-old and hiking with a friend, and the friend's Mom. But the hike was going slow, and Pebbles was obviously a little down. A week and half to Neel Gap.After meeting several fellow hikers, Pebbles decided she would join our ""bubble,"" and start making miles. She did, and she is one hell of a hiker.

Sheryl brings such enthusiasm and joy to the trail it’s impossible not to enjoy her company. This was her second section hike, and she completely immersed herself in the trail community, and is planning to do trail magic as the thru-hikers pass through Maryland.I will definitely miss Silver Fox always coffee ready at a moments notice. Having people like these three join me for the start of my journey means more to me than they’ll ever know. Planning to skip Hiawassee, I was packed way too heavy as headed out this morning. 48 pounds to be exact, about 12 lbs. of it was food. I knew it was too much, however, just because I know better doesn’t mean I’m still not an idiot.Met “Norway” who is from East of Oslo and hiking to New York before heading home, and Electra from Detroit whom I nicknamed “Rock City.” Second Shift made camp just before dark, it was great to see him.Pebbles caught us at HogPen Gap and quickly teamed up to form a hiking trio with Norway and Rock City.Still feeling great, one small blister, and only 3 Vitamin I taken the whole hike.","Neel Gap

The trail guide says the trail ""skirts the summit,"" but I will tell you, barely. The trail just misses the summit. It was then a less difficult 4+ miles to Dick's Creek Gap and a long lunch. Met Wild Horse, 007, Scout, and Cheda.At the point I still had neither hiker legs, nor hiker hunger, but I sure had hiker fatigue. And after lunch it hit me hard.007 was in front of me heading up Buzzard Knob, when he looked back, leaning over, resting on his trekking poles he yelled down to me, ""This is kicking my butt!"" Not something you expect to hear from someone taking his name from James Bond, but it was true, the hills were kicking our butts.We encouraged each other as we progressed a few yards, caught our breath, continued uphill until putting the climb behind us.

Maybe ""hiker legs"" are close??Another sunny day, so far I've been really lucky as the weather goes.A good campfire was burning as I entered the shelter area, brothers Slo-Poke & Hot Rod are great at getting a good blaze going. Conversation around fire pit turned too fast to religion and views, including one 22-year old hiker who had all the answers. Any disagreement just made him louder. I quickly exited the fire area for peace and quiet. The woods are a great place for reflection and questions, not such a great place for loud forceful answers.Enjoyed seeing Crumb Cake, 007, Norway, and Pebbles at shelter area.Another cold night in store, no worries, my gear has been great.

Due to the wind some the rain splashed up under my rain fly and dampened my underquilt, and got my pack wet. I'll have to hang the hammock higher on future rainy nights.I was in no hurry to get going this morning as I had only 7.3 miles to Winding Stair Gap and a ride into town. Before getting out of hammock, MoLa peeked under to say bye as she hit the trail, I fear i won't see her again because she is doing more miles than me, and I'm taking the next 2 days off. It's too bad because she is such a positive person on the trail.Had coffee with Pumbaa and Timon, 22-year old friends that both have a great attitude and are a joy to hang out with. I hope I'll see them a lot during my journey. The shelter was busy earlier, and loud. It seems many hikers are anxious to get into town. I was excited to get into town as well, just not in a hurry.The hiking was fairly easy, I stopped at the Rock Gap Shelter for coffee and a mini-bagel with salami, when I saw Pumbaa hauling ass with no pack heading South. He said he had forgot his phone and something else at previous shelter, but still had a great attitude.Called for a cab at Winding Stair Gap, very nice driver, Judy, took me to post office and then motel. A warm shower felt great !! Later on I walked downtown to the Lazy Hiker Brewing Co. where I met fellow thru-hiker Stefon. A quiet guy I had seen on the trail several times, but never talked.

Toward the end of the hike today, we went up the stone tower on Wayah Bold for a breathtaking panoramic view.Earlier in the day Wild Horse insisted that we summit Siler Bald, since she was told it was one of the five best views on the whole AT.

So I hiked on, improving my mood as I moved along. Had a nice pasta sides meal at Tri-Corner Knob Shelter, and got ready for an evening hike.My mood was greatly improved hiking alone in the evening, and realizing that doing big miles wasn't killing me.

It was, of course, the Smokies management. I was informed that before I arrived, a ridge runner came to the shelter and made everyone not in the shelter hang their packs. And proceeded to speak about thru-hikers in a very pejorative fashion. Saying that we are the ones that cause the problems in the park, and that we act like we have some kind of right to hike through the park. Basically treating thru-hikers very nasty.I WASN'T WRONG...I'M NOT DELUSIONAL. THE SMOKIES MANAGEMENT HATES US.The attitude of the ridge runner that so pissed off the other thru-hikers was proof that indeed the attitude toward thru-hikers by the Smokies management was biased, hateful, and toxic.

After 500 miles on the AT Greyhound looked like she had just left a beauty salon. Chopper, not so much. But he was doing great making his way up his 2700 ft. seemingly endless climb.I was on pace to make Hot Springs around 5 pm which is exactly what I had originally planned. Upon arriving in Hot Springs the buzz was all about the fires north of the city which have closed off some miles of the AT. Word is that we will have to be shuttled around the burn area, and miss anywhere from 10-14 miles of the trail. Ours will still an official thru-hike because missing that section is beyond our control, but I know I will find a way to get back and knock out that section.Enjoyed some beer and food before trail volunteer and friend Robert Ingram came and took me to his home in nearby Greeneville, TN for some rest and relaxation and a zero day, or two.Will get update on status of fire and trail closures before deciding when to move on.","Walnut Mountain Shelter

He was what some might call an earthy, hippy. But his positive outlook, and desire to work together to make the shelter as comfortable as possible is just what I needed. We used my hammock rain tarp to block the snow blowing in from gaps under the roof in the back of the shelter.

I will be updating my journal over the next couple days.The hike continues to go well, but I am ready to get out of Pennsylvania. The rocks are different than I expected. I thought it would be miles and miles of just rocks, no trail, but instead it is mostly smooth, and flat with area of intense rock climbing and bouldering.The real issue has been 90 degree heat and scarce water. In Northern PA it is common for a water source to be at least 1/2 mile off trail, and they are now often dry.The climb out of Lehigh Gap was the most intense and challenging of the entire hike.Forget the Virginia Blues, I had me a case of the Pennsylvania Blues. This break is just what I needed.","Campsite near mile 1263

Brother Blood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546141,"It's been awhile since I updated, but I'm still on trail and moving on. For more frequent updates you can ""Like"" my Facebook page: Brother Blood's 2016 AT Hike.I'm in Vermont at mile 1635 part way up Stratton Mountain, at a primative campsite with anice fire, and feeling great. It is so nice to be back at higher elevations at night, no bug net on hammock now, and nice cool, crisp mountain air.Tweeked my back back in New York. Vitamin I kept me doing miles, but sleeping was tough for about 5 nights. Had my first zero 2 days ago in over 300 miles. My body needed it.People in Connecticut were very nice, and really started feeling good there, back recovered and pace was good.The friends that did the first four days with me, Maverick and Silver Fox, flew up to bike a week with me. It's humbling to have people like them sharing my journey.I'll try to update more often, but until then, Brother Blood is heading up the next mountain !!!","Wind Gap, PA

The journey continues its wonders. Vermont was beautiful, and the people tremendous.

Almost out of the Whites, climbed Wildcat today, steep but not a real difficult climb. Currently at mile 1875 and looking forward to Southern Maine, the the turn for home. Looking at a completion date of October 4.Hard to believe I'll soon be in Maine. Looking forward to a zero in Gorham, NH Saturday.","Hanover, NH

Brother Blood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550374,"I did it !!!On October 4th I woke at 4:30 am, enjoyed two last cups of coffee in my hammock, and headed out, in the dark to summit Khatadin.The finish was anticlimactic, since for me it was about the journey, not the destination. But I was certainly happy to have made it.I think part of it was that my body was beat, and with colder nights and shorter days, I was ready for the journey to end.I will be going back and updating details of my hike, and find me at Facebook: Search ""Brother Blood"".","Birches Lean-To

Brother Blood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551918,"To all my fellow hikers preparing for the A.T. in 2017 or later. As a 2016 thru-hiker, I will not lay out a list things you ""must"" do. Nor will I offer unsolicited advice about my way was the right way. I know that it is true, that free advice is worth exactly what you paid for it.Your journey is yours, enjoy it. Do it your way. I never had the lightest pack, and somehow made Katahdin carrying the backbreaking weight of an entire toothbrush, handle and all. I was never the first one up and leaving camp, I was almost always last.Not long into my hike I realized I would not being doing 20's on a regular basis.I thought I could finish in about 5 1/2 months, it took me 6 months and 1 week. But I got to see the colors change in Maine.I let go of first impressions, and got to know other hikers for who they really were. That's one piece of advice I will give.I can't tell what shoes or socks to wear, or what pack is best, or whether to tent or hammock. But I am happy to answer any questions you might have.
