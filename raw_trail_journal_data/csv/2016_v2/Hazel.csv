Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505257,"Out of respect for the 2014 Hiker who had the trail name Mary Poppins I have chosen another name. At work, some time ago, I changed my name to Hazel. Why you ask, it is because there where getting to be far too many people with the same name as me. There were no Hazels  I had been reading the book A Fault in Our Stars. The main character is Hazel. She is smart (I am not). She has a good attitude and I really liked her. So Hazel it is.Last week I got my back pack. I'm so excited. I got the Gregory Diva 60. I thought I wanted the 70. I decided the bigger the pack the more stuff I'll try to take. If I could make it with a book bag that would be easier to carry.Yesterday I ran 8km in the morning then carried my groceries home in my book bag 11km. It was my day off. I am a server at a senior's home. I run on my feet all day. I hope it will serve me well for my hike.",,View Entry,"Jul 15, Tue",0

Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506936,"I just don't like them. I am really trying to get over my fear of them. I even touched one at the zoo. I have studied them, behavior,diet and their likelihood of hurting me. I thought I was doing better till today. I was running. I normally come across a couple or so down by the river on the path. This little guy was on the sidewalk on the bridge. He had nowhere to go, neither did I. I stopped. I couldn't pass. I looked around hoping someone else would come along. They didn't. The snake parked himself on the very edge. I hoped he would stay there as I passed as far on the other side as possible.
What am I going to do on the trail! If you hear a scream it's me coming across a snake. I'll be frozen in place until the snake moves away or someone else gently persuades it to move.",,View Entry,"Jul 24, Fri",0
Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509263,"I climbed Cascade Mountain in Banff, 9835ft. Up was hard work. Down was terrifying. So much loose rock and so steep. I got stuck three times. I just couldn't move I was that scared. My very kind friend gently helped me. I wish she was coming on the trail with me.
I learned a few life lessons up there. #1. I could not see the trail as I looked down at all the rocks. Sometimes you just have to have faith and take one step at a time without knowing exactly where you'll end up. #2. I always thought if I worked really hard, gave it my best, I could accomplish my goal. On the mountain I couldn't. There was one spot where I lost my footing. Couldn't get a grip anywhere with my feet. I was hanging on with my hands to a small edge in the rocks. I really thought , this is it, today I die. My friend came for me. I did not want to take her hand. I thought I would pull her down too. She said she had good footing and a firm hold. I took her hand and she swung me over. Sometimes after all you can do, you need help. Let people help you.",,Mountains,"Aug 09, Sun",0

Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518178,"I registered my hike this morning with the ATC voluntary registry. There are only 130 days till I start. I've never done anything this big before. Have I done everything I can to prepare? Have I studied enough? Am I fit enough? All these doubts are becoming more real. My big dream is coming closer to reality. I am going to make it happen. It all depends on me.
In church today the lessons focused on Christ's life and mission. And how we should emulate his works in our everyday life so that we can return to live with Him. My mind wandered. What if I knew the date I would meet my Savior. How would I be preparing differently. I think my questions would be the same. Have I done everything I can to prepare? Have I studied enough? Am I fit enough?
I've read Zack's book. I've written down so many reasons why I want to go. I am probably the most stubborn, self motivated, independent person on the planet. Yet I am filled with self doubt over this undertaking. I have the ability to turn problems into positives. I will say this anxiety and self doubt is a blessing to keep me on my toes and planning toward my start date. What do you think?",,Am I Ready?,"Dec 06, Sun",0

Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519406,"I've been living and working in Alberta since Sept 2014. I went home to New Brunswick for almost three weeks this summer to see my son graduate and to run two of my favorite races. 
When I left home I wasn't sure I would ever live with my husband again. I was so tired of being told ""no"" all the time, to anything. I worked in a nursing home. I knew many men and women who sat in their wheel chairs or lay in their beds wishing they had have done this or that in their lives. I didn't want to become one of them. I didn't want to say, ""I would have hiked the AT if my husband let me"". How sad would that have been. 
Time and effort have changed my husband. He now wants to drive me to Georgia and slack pack me for the first few days. It is 99 days today till I start my hike. It is 81 days today until I fly home. I am nervous and scared. All normal feelings when approaching a huge adventure. I may not finish but it will not be because I didn't try.",,flight booked!,"Jan 08, Fri",0

When I am at home on my day off like today, I am in total panic mode. I am to the point right now that I can't think what to do first. Know one really understands these feelings unless you are preparing to jump off this cliff yourself.
I leave Calgary March 30. I straighten out plans with my family (as much as possible). Then I drive to Georgia am start my hike April 16. I think I will do the approach trail on the 14th. I'll let the weather decide that for me

I went to an outfitter this afternoon. I decided to give hiking boots a try. Maybe they will save my feet from too much wear and tear.

I will walk with her.My husband is helping me for the first week of this adventure. I am not carrying a full pack yet. It is a real luxury to start this way. I am very grateful for all the help.

Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528620,"I have been worried about doing Blood Mountain because of the reports I have read in these journals. Let me help out those who follow, don't worry about it. Yes, it is hard. It takes effort, but it is not scary. I never felt like I was going to fall because it was steep on the way down. That is scary. Feeling helpless or out of control. That is scary.
The next scary thing is my feet. My big toes have blisters on the bottom of them. My little toe on the right has a blister, the left is just angry and red. The ball of both my feet are not happy with me. This is going to be a problem. I hope it goes away soon.","Gooch Gap

Uphill is ok and down is very painful. I am also having sun stoke symptoms. I am so burnt. The sun is great to have but it seems I sweat off the sun screen very fast. I know I will get better. I am putting my feet up for the rest of the day. I hope I get a good day in tomorrow. 
We are in the town of Helen for the next two nights. The Best Western here gives hikers a very generous discount. This is the best place we have stayed.
This is a German town. I bought some Hansel and Gretel fudge. That should fix me right up
Last night I only woke up once. That is remarkable for me. Who knew hiking would be the cure for insomnia.

My feet are still complaining but I iced them last night and again today when I was done hiking. That really made a positive difference. I met several nice people on the trail. Jess is hiking by herself. She is very pleasant. She had a short day today because of blisters. I have met several people who said it's harder then they thought it would be. One called for a shuttle at a break stop and was planning his flight home. I am tired and very sore but I know it will get better and my only thought is, how can I get better faster. I just want to do it.","Hogpen Gap

Everyone is so friendly and interested in what brought each other out here. It was still raining in the morning. I had breakfast in my tent, packed up in the rain and hiked out at about 8:30. I stopped at Standing Indian Shelter to make a hot lunch. At this point I still have no appetite. I was so amazed that my feet stayed dry. The trail was like a stream in most places. It stopped raining around 3 and I got to Carter Gap about 5. I was surprised to find 4 ladies my own age there. It was wonderful to listen to them and know we are all going through the same stuff. At about 8 it started to rain again. I was really worried about the tent. It was still wet from the night before. Would a wet tent keep me dry? Then the Thunder started. The ladies in the shelter said they would make room for me. I thanked them and said if the tent leaked I would be in. The tent did not leak. I woke up warm and dry.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

I had to pack up the poles and use my hands, fun stuff but tricky with a pack. At the top is a fire tower. I used it as a laundry line to dry my tent. It was a lot lighter walking down the other side.
My feet are doing some serious complaining. I am going into Franklin for the night and taking tomorrow completely off. I got a call into Stephen today. Amazingly my phone worked.","Carter Gap Shelter

I was invited to stay at a member's home tonight. Jerry and Jeannie Novak could not be kinder. Jerry got me an Epsom salt bath to soak my feet in and a root beer float. Jeannie just massaged my feet. She is an Rn. She really knows what she is doing. I don't normally let anyone touch me but I am desperate to get these feet better. I feel very well taken care of and am so thankful for their kindness.
I will be back on the trail tomorrow morning and will try to take more boots off feet up breaks. Unfortunately there are not always places to do this.","Rock Gap Shelter

I got to the shelter at 7. That is late for me. Tonight is the first time since I started that I felt hungry. I don't sleep in the shelters I stop at them because there are always others there. I love chatting with the other hikers at night or just listening to them. I can't seem to keep enough sun screen on. My left arm is so burnt it's blistering. It's quite painful getting the pack on and off. I am trying to keep it covered now with my bandana. The only long sleeve shirt I have would be too hot to hike in. Just little challenges. I am do happy to be out here doing this. I met a lady named Bugsy at the shelter. I said to her, we are so lucky to be doing this. We had such a beautiful starry sky.","Rock Gap Shelter

Next I came across a big black snake, like 4ft long. It didn't want to move off the trail. I waited about 10 min for the guys I knew where behind me to catch up. They moved the snake. Next I had a good but expensive lunch at the NOC. The climb out of there is well known, 3000 ft of elevation over 6 miles.

My plan was to hike 9 miles to the next shelter. Sometimes life has other plans. I have been having trouble eating. I am just not hungry. I should be really hungry. My poor system is in shock I guess. So,I had no energy today but I determined pushed on. Then on a down hill I felt the muscle above my knee give a sharp complaint. No amount of massage or pain killers where helping. I hobbled down a long hill to a road where I could get a hostel for the night. So, here I am updating the journal with my feet up.

I started out great. I had a big climb over Jacobs ladder. The trail is very steep there. I gave myself a little sermon on the struggles Jacob had in his life and how he over came them. I covered 4 miles in an hour and a half then my leg started to complain again. It got serious. It took me 8 hrs to cover the next 10 miles. I had no choice but to do it. I had to get to my pack. Additionally, it started to thunder. I limped along pitifully for the last two hours in the rain. What an adventure. I was going to camp but after my day I got a room at the lodge. Perfect move because I met up with Bugsy again. She caught up with me because of my short day then my zero. I told her about my leg and we decided to hike together for a bit. Bugsy is 72.

Everyone needs a paper print out of the permit. It was stressful. We finally forwarded our email confirmations to the front desk computer and the nice lady there printed them off for us. I'm not sure how I would have handled that on my own. That's the great thing, you are never really alone.","Fontana Dam

I met Focus tonight she has hiked the Pct and the CDT. Once she is done the AT she will have her triple crown. I had so many questions for her. We had a very nice chat over dinner. She says the AT is very hard in comparison to the PCT. I have heard that before.
Bugsy and I hiked on slowly. By the end of the day it was hard for me to lift my foot over the rocks and roots. But, I'm still moving forward.","Mollie's Ridge Shelter

My leg felt great today. I hiked ahead of Bugsy on the up hill. She normally catchs me on the down. We didn't met up again until the shelter. I was so glad she made it. Then I had to tell her about the bear. I saw my first bear today. He was close to the trail ahead. He just ran through the trees off to the left. What an amazing sight.
We have a Ridge Runner with us at the shelter. Kind of the Smokies law. She has an unfortunate personality. We are packed in here like sardines. I am extremely uncomfortable. Everything I have is wet and muddy. We sloshed through the rain all afternoon. My foot is killing me. Everyone, young and old, have blisters and sore feet. At night we peel our socks off, gingerly take the bandages off then let them air for the night. Next morning, rebandage and put our wet socks on again. Fun","Derrick Knob Shelter

We call all the shuttle numbers in our book they suggested we hitch hike! We were picked up by the nicest couple. After a 10 min drive down the hill they hugged us goodbye like we were family.
We showered,ate,did laundry and stocked up on foot care products. Back at the hotel I was taking care of my feet. I clipped the toenail on my right foot and it started to drip fluid. I went back to the drug store and got Epsom salt to soak it in. There seems to be fluid under the nail. I don't want it to get infected.","Mt. Collins Shelter

Funny how I knew this morning that this would be the day we part.

A hot fudge Sunday and a spinach salad. I didn't end up with either but I got a very good hamburger probably the best I ever had. I weighed myself tonight at the hostel. I have lost 18lbs in 26 days.

Packing up a wet tent is dirty. Carrying that wet tent is heavy. So there was a Hikers Paradise advertised and it was 9 miles away. I got going at 11 for my easy 9 mile day. Hikers paradise was a dump. Why do they think we have such low standards just because we are backpacking. They did help with the resupply so that was nice. Anyway, I left for the next shelter at 5:30. It took me till 9:30 to get there. So I was night hiking. That was fun. There were some others there. I was setting up and I realized it was too quiet.

Then I had a nice chat around a good fire. The temperature was really dropping. I was cozy in my tent but did not want to get out and I always have to, every night. Today I had trail magic.

Then I waddled over to the AT museum. Along the back wall was the old Katadin sign. I teared upwhen I saw it, thinking of all the people who had touched that sign and marked the end of their very long journey. I hiked a mile or so past the park boundary and choose a camp site. I was by myself. I could here people. Maybe they were at a baseball game, there seemed to be cheering. Voices carry a long way. It got dark. I still don't have my head lamp.

I yelled at him and said I was coming through so he better move. He didn't go any more then three car lengths away from me. I was glad he didn't follow me to camp.","Murray Cabin

I called and asked if there was anyone who could pick me up at the end of my day today, take me home and get me cleaned up for church tomorrow. A short time later Joanne called. She said she would love to have me over. My plan was to hike 22 miles today. The rock climbing slowed me down and this heat and humidity has been incredible. I called Joanne at 5 to say I was not going to make it to the agreed meeting spot. She said tell me where you are and I'll come right now and get you. Wow how wonderful. When I got to the road crossing I had been completely out of water for maybe an hour. That doesn't sound bad but it was. I was so dehydrated I had stopped sweating. I brushed the salt off my arms. Incredible people take time to leave water at road crossings. The people here know the hikers have no eater sources right now. The streams are dry. The ponds are low. This road crossing had just been restocked. I drank so much. Joanne brought me ice water. What a treat. She said it was 100 degrees today. We had a great supper. They had a Grannie suite downstairs all for me. I was so relaxed and comfortable. What great people to take me in.","Wawayanda Shelter

I camped just after I did the Lemon Squeezer. It was almost completely dark. I knew it was coming up. In order to get through I had to take off my pack and carry it infront of me. Then I put it and my poles on the ledge. I walked on a bit then got myself up and went back for my stuff. I shone my headlamp down where I came from to make sure I hadn't dropped anything.

It passed quickly. I thought if I hurry I can be under cover at the zoo when the next one comes. Bear mountain is bigger but so easy. The trail is just a masterpiece. The work that went into it is outstanding. It was a true pleasure to hike it. At the bottom the park concessions were closed. The zoo was closed. I had trouble finding the alternate after hours trail. I asked some picnickers how to get to the bridge. They were helpful and seemed surprised I came over to talk to them. I made it to the bridge just in time for the big storm. At the start of the bridge (over the Hudson) I could see the water. I wasn't even in the middle and the rain was so hard I could just see immediately in front of me. I still had to make it to the campsite that involved a steep up hill. The river of water coming down the trail added to my day. It had been hot even after the first storm. Now the temperature was dropping. It was hard with my glasses covered with water. At the same time it was refreshing  I got to the campsite and the rain was almost done. I got set up fast. I was so tired I couldn't eat.

I couldn't get any quarters. I started walking another 1.5 miles down the road to the next campground, Crawford Notch. It had a store. I was picked up by a couple of ladies who were out supporting their husbands on their hike. They had picked up another hiker and he asked them to stop for me. I wasn't even hitching at this piont.

I got phone service in and out. It was quite frustrating. The next time my phone went off I froze in place. I just happened to be going down a steep flat rock. I had my one foot on a root. My had on the tree and the phone in the other hand. I was literally hanging there. I got a call off to Stephen. I just wanted to be short and let him know I was ok. I hadn't talked to him since he left. I couldn't quit get the picture of my current situation across to him clearly. the conversation went on as I hung there. It was all good news. I also got a text from Storm. He was waiting for me at the Lake of the Clouds Hut. I replied that I couldn't make it there tonight. He said he would wait there till I came. I absolutely couldn't believe he was going to wait for me, wow. I got to Mizpah Spring Hut just as it was getting dark. I got to the campsite beside it and got m,y tent set up. I apologized to the two others beside me for the noise at the late hour and I introduced myself. They said , ""oh you are the infamous Hazel"". When Storm needs to get a message sent he sends it with everyone, they were all on the look out for Hazel. I was embarrassed and grateful all rolled into one. I decided I had made enough noise there so I took my food and stove over to the hut. The people there were still up (rich day hikers). Then I had a stroke of brilliance. I went into the hut and asked if they had any supper left over that I could work for. They wont let you buy it. They had lots. I did dishes for about 30 mins after I had eaten all I could handle. Its was so good. I went to bed full and happy.","Ethan Pond Campsite

Storm was outside the hut talking on his phone when I got there. I ran over and gave him a hug. I was really quit overwhelmed that he would wait for me. I warned him that I am walking a lot slower because my knees and ankles are done. He said great we are going to the five mile a day plan. This is something we talked about awhile ago in an effort to slow down our hike. I said perfect, I can do that. At Lake of The Clouds I told everyone about my friend Tim Sandford back home. Tim worked at this hut approximately 60 years ago. He would have loved to been here with me. I wish he was. Storm and I headed up Mt Washington together. This is the one I was scared of. After Franconia Ridge I didn't want any more wind. We were able to get cell reception at the top I called Stephen and sent off a few text. We made it to Madison Spring Hut by 5. We were spent. unfortunately they did not want to take any work for stays until 7 or later. The young man suggested we ""pop over Madison and stelt camp or go to Osgood Campsite"". All this was not happening today!. There would be no Popping. We made our way slowly down the 0.6 miles to the worst campsite. Storm and I shared a spot only meant for one tent. It was so funny trying to make it work. more hikers were coming in all evening. Storm was worried where they were going to go. After such a long climb down you just couldn't not find a spot.

I had a small slip and banged my elbow again. Storm had a big fall down by the river. He was ok, but his knee hurt. These things happen so fast.

It was so nice to see some of their favorite places. 
At supper my feet where getting worse as I sat there. By the end of supper my feet where so swollen. I soaked them in an ebsom salt bath it felt good but did knowthing for the swelling.

loaded multiple times. So the fix that a little I will just count my miles in the entry for a while.
Today we did 9.7 of the hardest miles yet. We did the Mahoosuc Notch. This is known as the most difficult or funnest mile of the trail. It is all boulders the size of cars or bigger. The trail goes over, under and around these things. It certainly was challenging. I got myself stuck at one point. It was a good job Storm was there. I hope everyone goes through that with a buddy. We passed by Speck Pond today. I would have loved to stay there but we had a dinner invite. Prim and Gray from way back in the first half of my hike, were in the area. They hiked to Harpers Ferry then came up to Katahdin and have been hiking back. It's called a flip. Storm and I tried hard to get to Grafton Notch as fast as we could. It took us till 7. Thankfully Prim and Gray waited for us. We had a great visit. We could have talked all night about all our adventures.

My hip and upper thigh is very bruised and my rib hurts but no bruise there. Well lucky I have another side to sleep on.
I did not want to put my wet socks on again today. It's the worst. The wet along with the dirt just makes your toes so raw. We decided to go in to a hostel at Andover and get cleaned up again. Before that could happen we had a mountain called Baldpate to go over. I was so scared on top, well not on top, as I was climbing up the open rock . We have had every challenge on this trail. I kept saying the next thing they were going to give us was a rope. Today we got it. To help us get down the rock to the ladder today we had a rope. I wish there was a lot more rope. I felt comfortable with that. So many times a day we have to cling to roots and trees to get down the steep wet rock.

When we got to the Katahdin stream campground we saw hikers we knew and haven't seen for awhile. It was all very emotional. My husband Stephen was determined to summit with us. This would be his first hike. The trail starts off gentle then as usual it changes. Then it becomes a boulder climb. Stephen said in his wildest nightmares he never thought it was going to be this hard. He gained a new appreciation for what it took to complete this trail. I told him I was mountain climbing in the Whites. He didn't understand what I meant until today. Storm's husband Jeff and his brother Doug where a tremendous help. We really all worked together to get up that mountain. I would not have wanted to do it alone. Kirk was also with us. It is his Dad's walking stick that Storm carried for him all the way from Springer mountain. Kirk's Dad died from cancer before he could hike the trail. Kirk and Storm knew each other in University. Kirk works for the news out of Portland I think. He interviewed Storm. He was filming us. When we got to the sing at the top I couldn't stop crying. I made it. I do not like to cry in front of people. I did not like my picture taken while crying. It made me very uncomfortable. This was the moment I had worked for and dreamed about for so long. I did it. I asked for help at the sign . It was very windy and I wanted to stand on it, victorious, like I had seen others do. There is a huge drop off about five feet behind the sign. Really, they don't make anything easy Storm and Jeff steadied me as I stood there for my picture. This is a picture I really wanted. Getting down was going to be another challenge. I was concerned about the time. Kirk suggested we take the Abole campground trail. It's shorter by a mile. It didn't have the boulders to climb over and down, tricky. It was very steep with loose gravel and dirt. I had trouble with it. My shoes were done for . The sides were split so my feet turned in them when I steeped on an angel. My knees were not dependable any more at this point. My ankles were turning more easily. I was worn out. The good news was that Stephen liked this trail much better. He was in a lot of pain from his knees as well but his confidence on the trail was great. This was the most challenging first hike he could ever have picked. Because we took a different trail back down we had to get a ride back to our cars and to the people who were waiting for us. Amazingly Julie and Bill Haas who came from Nova Scotia to see me, where waiting at the ""wrong"" place. They were right there waiting for us as we came out. They congratulated us then drove us around to our cars as we explained to them what had happened. It was so great. After lots of smiles and hugs and tears we headed to Millinocket for dinner all together. While there we met up again with other hikers. There is such a bond with these people. Only another hiker knows really what you just went through. Storm and I sat together at supper. I was dreading saying goodbye to him.","Katahdin Stream campground

Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549622,"I kept telling Storm he could finish the hike faster if he didn't wait for me. I said you should hike with Cake she is faster. You will have fun. I wasn't trying to get rid of him. I just felt bad when he had to wait for me. I am amazed at his patience and that he really enjoyed being with me. He even wrote down in his phone some of the things I always said so he wouldn't forget them. I know we will remain friends but it is not the same as being together every day. I could have finished this hike on my own but it would not have been nearly as fun. One morning we did not want to change out of our leggins we sleep in. As the day got warmer I had to find a place to do a complete bottom change. Pine needles on your socks as you slip into your shorts, not good. Storm was in the same situation. We got to the top of something and it was all rock with some good boulders to lean on. I said ok I need to change here. No peaking. Storm said he would change he too. We were about 15ft apart each with our own boulder for support. I said, you realize this is when the boy scout troop is going to come up the trail We had such fun. I want to thank Storm for all his help, support and friendship.",,Home,"Sep 22, Thu",0
Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550348,"I came on this hike for many reasons but I did it in memory of my daughter Jen. She would have been 29 years old on April 16 when I started. I carried her baby shoes with me from start to finish. I also wear one of her rings. It was nice to have a bit of her with me. Towards the end of the hike I told Storm I wanted to get a picture of Jen's shoes with some of my favourite things. He and I collected the leaves and looked for a sunny spot with bright green moss. I also love the white birch bark and this beautiful ivy that grows along the trail. I tried to get it all together for the picture. Jen didn't really like camping but she loved walking in the woods with her dog. I have come to a peaceful place in my heart now. I still wish she was here. I still wish I could have stopped her, helped her. But, now I am not so sad. Jen did what she felt was the only choice for her. I have to go on living. I have to be happy. I can be happy. I have chosen to be happy. I know I will see my daughter again. I now know that Jen knows I love her. That's all that matters. I am grateful for the time I had to ponder in the woods.",,View Entry,"Oct 11, Tue",0
Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552635,"I am working on my journal now. I want to add the pictures to each day. I didn't know how to do that for over half my hike. Finally I met Storm and asked him to teach me how to add pictures. Well now I have plenty of time to work on my journal.
Just a little update on me. I never finished high school. It's something I always wanted to do. About 10 days after I finished my hike I started GED school. I am registered to write the test in Feb. It is five tests with a total time allowed of 10hrs, given over two consecutive days. I am so happy to be doing this. I have applied for cooking school in the fall I hope I get in. I feel I'm taking charge of my life.
Merry Christmas everyone 
Make great plans for the New Year.

Hazel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598709,After finishing my hike my first priority was to finish high school. I enrolled in the Adult Learning program and got to work. Oct 2016 - March 2017 I studied and wrote test after test. Mar I took the final testing and passed. At 52 years old I finally finished high school with a GED. Better late then never.Next I enrolled in College. The Culinary Arts program at NBCC St.Andrews. I had been cooking for years but had no papers of any kind.
