Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/489325,"People on the trail now are reporting a lot of trash and large of groups of People are hiking, sometimes entire families. Sometimes 30 People to a shelter. I'm guessing movies like ""wild"" and ""a walk in the woods"" (coming out next year I think) are making thru hikes more popular.To avoid the crowds I'm going to start mid-feb and deal with the harsh cold. Anyone reading this could try a South bound trip to avoid crowds. I'll also pick up some trash along the way. Hopefully everyone pitches in to make the AT a nice place for everyone.","
