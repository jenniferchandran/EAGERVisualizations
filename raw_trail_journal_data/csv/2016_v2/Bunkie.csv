Yes, I am nervous about everything that goes into preparing for the trail. From; gear, clothes, food, logistics to retiring, from work, at the end of March and beginning the trail in April. I feel lucky and very blessed to have the support of my family and friends for this adventure I have thought about for so very long.",,Getting ready.,"Jan 18, Mon",0

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519951,"As my ""getting ready"" phase moves forward I feel blessed to not be on the trail at the current time. The cold weather is quite crippling. I did a simple two hour hike yesterday and the water line, from bladder, froze. One of my favorite things to do is to hike with Chrissy and our dog, Sammi. Neither will be joining me on the hike and that brings a bit of sadness to my heart. But, the good news is they will try to meet me in different sections around the Virginia area. As I mentioned in my, about section, I am not only preparing to walk the trail, I am also retiring at the end of March. I think this too has my head and stomach in a bit of a knot. I have loved my job but there are so many other things I want to do...... So, I have to practice that thing called, trust! Trust that things will work out just fine, fall into place and I will be able to explore so many other life opportunities.",,Getting ready.,"Jan 21, Thu",0
Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520069,"I have thought about walking the AT for quite some time. Always putting it on the back burner due to other chapters in my life....mainly work!    I plan on retiring at the end of March and begin walking the trail in the first week of April. I am very fortunate to have the support of my best friend and partner, Chrissy. Without her and the support she will provide, along the way, this adventure would only be more difficult. A little about myself - - I am 55 and currently live in Fredericksburg, VA. After teaching school for 9 years in the New Orleans area I changed careers and took a job that has afforded me the opportunity to live in several different states. I have lived in Texas, Kentucky, Vermont and Virginia. While Vermont was my favorite I was able to make great friends and experience so much in each state. I followed and learned so much through the journals written by several previous thru hikers (Jericho, Lady Grey, Left Turn, Bon Bon, Kat Walk, Elaine, Airlocks, Wired - to name a few). Because of their shared words, feelings, suggestions, successes and struggles I feel as though I have learned so much....and now I will be the one on the trail sharing my adventure.   My trail name will be, Bunkie. This is a small town in Louisiana where I was born and raised. I identify with it as the place that ""made me""....where I learned the value of hard work, friends and family.",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Sat",0
Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520474,"In approximately 2 months I will begin my walk towards Maine. I am both excited and nervous. I find that I can't turn my mind off... Thinking about/---being prepared, having the right gear, food, rain... Etc!    I have to stop my thinking and learn to trust that I have prepared and continue to prepare for this adventure . This past week I was in Tucson and had the opportunity to hike in The Sabino Canyon Recreational Area with one of my best friends and his wife. What a treat to hike among the rock cliffs and desert vegetation. I would highly recommend the area for anyone passing through the Tucson region. While I am very excited about my upcoming hike I also know that I will miss my family and friends tremendously.   But I also know they will all follow my journal and support me the best way they can.I continue to hike with my pack making sure things feel right. My shoulders sometimes bother me after 2 hours ... So I have learned to stop...take the pack off and do a series of stretches and then start again. Hopefully that 2 hour range will go to 3, 4, etc... I do a lot of walking/hiking with my dog, Sammi, who I will miss so much! I wish she was joining me but I think it will be hard enough for me to make this trek much less adding food and water for her. Besides, she is 11 and I don't think it is a great idea. Good luck to all the others who have started their hike! And to the rest who are preparing ... I hope you all stay injury free.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Sun",0
Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520711,"After reading Wired's blog and researching her suggestions on gear I decided to purchase the go lite umbrella. There is actually a video on you tube on how to secure it to your packs shoulder strap. So, while it was raining yesterday, I secured my umbrella to my pack and walked in my neighborhood for two hours. Let's just say ... I'm so glad Wired listed that as one of her favorite pieces of gear. Yes, it is considered a luxury.. But not having the rain pelt me in the face was great. It might not be for everyone.... But I'll be sure to carry it. As more and more of my family and friends hear about my plans to walk the trail ... The more REAL this decision becomes. Everyone has wished me well. I appreciate all of the votes of confidence and the support.   It really means a great deal to me. Recently I was toying with the idea of doing a flip flop hike (Harper's Ferry to Maine then Harper's F to Springer Mountain) but I have scratched that idea and plan to do my hike... Starting at Springer and walking North!! For those who have already started your journey... Happy Safe Trails to you. Looking forward to following in your footsteps.",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Thu",0

Retired! And heart dog.. Simply means Sammi is such a big part of heart. I'm lucky to live a short hour from the Shenandoah mountains. I try to do a lot of my training hikes there. It was a beautiful but a tad cold hiking day . Of course it did not help that we had several water crossings causing us both to have wet feet. I did learn however.... I will keep a dry pair of socks in my outside pocket of my pack. Making it easier to change... If I choose to do so.I recently switched to a ULA Circuit pack and really like how it is designed. I had 27 lbs which felt good... Realizing that I will probably range from 27 to 35 (ish) lbs depending on food and water weight. I do find that I do best if I concentrate on taking my pack off... Every now and then throughout the day...and do a few stretches. That might change on the thru hike but I don't want to be in such a hurry on this hike that I ignore the small things that might help me in the long run. I may be young at heart but.... Reality is I am 55.I have found myself thinking more and more about leaving my family for 6 months to follow my dream. Without their support and understanding.. This would be so much harder. I am both lucky and forever grateful!!! Thanks!!",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Sun",0
Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523041,"I have enjoyed reading the journals of those who have started their AT journey. It makes me very anxious and eager to follow in their footsteps. I find myself wondering about the people I will meet and befriend when I start the trail. I have one more week of work then I will be home, finalizing logistics and getting things done around the house. My plan is to travel south, to Georgia, via a one way rental car. And start walking on April 5 or 6. There is a slight chance that I'll head to Georgia a few days early and maybe start around the April 1. As I go through my everyday activities, my mind fast forwards to being on the trail, knowing that everything from brushing my teeth, using the bathroom, eating, sleeping...EVERYTHING-- will be so different.   I look forward to the challenges but I would be lying if I did not also say, it also scares me! One of my friends has expressed an interest in starting the trail with me. She would stay about a week and then head back to DC. While I would love the company..... I also know that if those plans change I am good with starting alone. If she forgoes the start she will definitely join me during the middle of my journey. I want to thank all of my family and friends who have shown so much interest and well wishes for me as I share with them my plans for this thru hike.   I am very blessed.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Wed",0

First, 9 years of teaching and then 22.5 years of Government work. I would not trade either. But, now as a friend has told me.... don't call it retiring....call it refocusing. So, that is what I am doing...refocusing - - - First I'll walk this trail, The AT, that has been calling my name since graduating from college. I plan to make it all the way but i am at a point in my life that what I know is: I will give it my all...I will fight through the tough days..I'll enjoy nature....I'll embrace the challenge...I'll savor the new friends that I make.....I'll ask for emotional help from family and friends when I feel like I can't take another step. The unknown, of the trial, the weather, the injuries, the ""unknowns"" - - -are what keep me up at night. I wake wondering -- OMG - - what if, what do I do when, etc... You name it...I'm thinking about it at 2 a.m.!!Whenever I am deep in thought, going through life changes, accepting good and bad things (in life), dealing with whatever.... I become quite and reflective. That is where I am now. I look around at my family and friends and know that I will miss them terribly. But, I have their unwavering support and that gives me such peace of mind. THANKS!!I have packed, re-packed and packed my backpack hundreds of times... I will have to trust my prep work and the advice given to me by thru hikers who walked before me - - who were gracious enough to post their journey. I am actually leaning towards starting a week early since Spring seems to be a bit early this year. I have a few logistical things to work out and I will post when I know for sure when I plan on starting my journey.",,One more work week,"Mar 13, Sun",0
Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524201,"I have moved my start date to March 25. Originally, I was departing the first week of April but as things have progressed I am lucky to have the flexibility to change my plans. I will drive to Gainesville, Georgia on Thursday where I will be picked up by the owners/operators of The Hiker Hostel. I will spend the night at the Hostel and then receive a shuttle ride to Springer Mountain on Friday morning. A good friend, Keri, will start the hike with me. She is planning on doing between 3 and 6 days before she heads home. I am glad that she is willing and able to join me for the first few days. So many people have wished me luck, expressed their concerns and interest in what I am about to do. And to be honest there are times that I am thinking..... OMG... What the heck... But, then I settle myself and know that - -things will be OK. My pack weight is roughly 34 lbs. That includes 4 days of food. I am hoping that the weather cooperates for the start but also know that that is soooooo out of my control and I just have to roll with it. Now..... I just have to wait for Friday .... and my journey will begin.",,A few changes.,"Mar 20, Sun",0
Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524702,"Today I arrived in Georgia. After visiting Amicalola Falls State Park and registering as a 2016 Thru Hiker I drove to Gainsville, Ga to drop off my rental car. Not everyone resisters ... But I opted to do so as it helps the AT conservatory keep track of trail usage. I am #980 for this year. Tonight I am staying at a hiker hostel... Where I have a bed in a cargo shipping container. Pretty cool digs! Tomorrow, breakfast will be at 7:30 and then I will be shuttled to Springer Mountain for my first day of hiking. My friend, Keri will arrive later tonight and she will hike with me for a few days. Nice to start with someone I know. I must admit that today has been an emotional day. I have been all over the chart with emotions. I was asked why.. And to be honest.. I'm not so sure. I guess I have thought about this for so long, planned, practiced, read, etc... And now I am here. I have done quite a bit in my life and I will say this one has me... Wondering.. What will this journey be ? Can I do it? There are so many unknowns that I feel like I'll literally take... One step at a time.. And let it all unfold. Thanks to all who have wished me well. I especially need to thank, Chrissy. Without her.. This would not be happening. She has been so supportive...even when I have become a bit crazy !!! She is my family!!   I will try to post every day but as you all realize that requires cell service. Ok.

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524825,"First day on the trail. Sleep was NOT happening last night. Neither Keri or myself slept. Our minds were racing and the anticipation of starting the hike got the best of us. After breakfast we took an hour van ride to Springer Mountain. The parking lot was one mile from the summit. So we walked up... Took pictures and then retraced that Mile to start our hike. We left the parking lot at 10:30. Our pace was good and we made it to hawk mountain shelter at 2:30. Covering 8.1 miles. We decided to end our day here as there are not good water sources for another 6 miles... Pretty tough ones at that. We set up our tents, cooked dinner and it is only 4:10 pm. Too funny. We are both pretty tired so I am sure we will be sleeping by sundown. 8 pm. It was a great first day.","

Keri and I both slept ok.. Not great but ok. A group of young hikers next to us had a stove fire ! But in the end not a big deal. I woke around 2 am thinking it was 6 because it was so light out.. Only to figure out it was a beautiful moon! We woke at 6:30 packed up camp. It took 1.5 hours to do that. Hopeful that will improve. We walked out of our site at 8 and walked until 2:45 We did some tough climbs today. Had our first trail magic!! It was awesome. Hot coco, banana bread, apples and more importantly they offered to take our trash. We obviously carry all trash out and it is nice to get rid of it! When we got to woody's gap it was turning cold and starting to rain. So we called a hostel that had two bunks for $20. We jumped on it. It is a large room with plywood bunks. We have our sleeping bag on top, it is a room above a general store. We have ordered a pizza from the store and we are washing clothes in the store supply room. We are also sitting on a couch , in the store, watching the basketball game. One stop shopping at its best.","hawk mountain shelter

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525052,"We left our bunk bed at 7:25 and tried our hand at hitch hiking. What I learned: if cars don't pass you will stand there a long time! Two cars did pass and they waved but I think they were on their way to Easter Services. We caught a ride with the store owner so all worked out in the end. It was a tough hiking day as the climb up and over Blood Mountain was quite taxing. Add to that it rained all day. That was actually ok but made for a very slippery hike. When it started lightening we voted on trying to get a bed at Neels Gap. We were successful !! So again out of the rain for the night. We had room for two others in our space so we have a young couple from NY bunking with us. At the gap we were also able to purchase pizza. I might get my fill of pizza on this hike. But it sure taste good after a tough hike. We have s good pace going and hope to make tomorrow's hike a tad longer. Keri has decided to stay until the NC state border. She has been such good company. I'll miss her when she is gone. I shipped a few things home. Trying to lower my pack weight a All is good on the AT. For all those reading, following along, sending messages..

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525252,"Today is day #4 of hiking. Prior to departing Neels gap I had the outfitter, in the Mountain Crossing Store, review my pack. He showed me one little trick on tighten my pack.. That made all the difference in the world. I am using the ULA circuit pack . We departed around 8:30 a.m. Hiking for 7.5 hours. We are stealth camping.. (Just a random , flat spot, in the middle of the forest). We are not 100% sure where we are. But we know we walked at least 15 miles. A third person, Trotter, has joined us.   After we set up tents and hung our bear bags we were joined by another lady, Hazelnut. The bear bag hanging.. Simply throwing a rope (thin and very light) over a tall branch and then hoisting your food bag so it dangles high enough that bears or other animals can get to it. But, Keri and I both agree that a very smart possum would climb the tree and pull the rope up.. Sit on the branch and enjoy all of our food. But, we do this anyway because I rather them do that at the tree and not in or around my tent. During the day Keri put duct tape to the test and covered a hot spot on her heel. So far so good. Duct tape is a hiker essential. The weather was perfect today. I'm hoping it is not to cold tonight. So far I am pleased with all my gear choices. I did weigh my pack this morning at the Outfitters and with all my gear, 2 liters of water and two days of food I was at 32.5. I am comfortable with that. I am enjoying everything but also know that I have just begun. While this is a great physical challenge I also know the mental part is just as hard.. If not harder. Back at home Chrissy is holding down the fort and taking care of everything!! She has the harder job! To all who have written.. Thank you so much. It is great reading your comments. As I type this... I am thinking.. Oh no, did I put my tent in a bad spot ... The wind is blowing right over the mountain and into my tent. Might be a long night. Oh, I have seen about 4 dogs hiking the trail... All carry their own little pack. I stop and say hello to each... I do miss my dog, Sammi. There are two groups of people out here. The younger crowd that tends to start hiking mid to late morning and then they stay up pretty late . And then there is the older (smarter/wiser ) group. That is where Keri and I fall. I am currently in my sleeping bag as I type this. And in my bag... I have my clothes , that I wear to hike, so I can keep them warm. Makes it easier to get dressed in the morning.","neels gap

I was told that Georgia was a tough mountain state... And I am here to say/-- it sure is!! The climbs are straight up.. Not much in the way of switchbacks. Trotter, a woman from Kansas has hiked with us for the past two days. She has a great pace and her company is enjoyable. She retired last year and decided to chase after her AT dream. Everyone on the trail is very nice. Most conversations go like this: Hi. Where did you come from (meaning: where did u start hiking this morning), where are u trying to go (meaning: where do you think u are sleeping tonight), are you a thru hiker (are u trying for Maine), what is your name (trail name). And, if U are close to a town... Any good info on all you can eat buffets is passed along. So far this has been a good experience. It is quite tough both mentally and physically. I think on the advice given to me by so many/-- one day, one step, at a time. Keri will leave on Thursday and head back to DC. Her company has been great. I'll be sad to see her go.Tomorrow we are hiking 10 miles and then catching a ride into town. We need to get supplies: food, fuel, take showers, etc. we will sleep at a budget inn that gives hikers a cut rate ??Thanks again for following along.","cold spring gap

Keri and I did not sleep well due to our tents were on a bit of a slope. Gosh that can make for a bad night .. Sliding off your sleep pad and into the corner of your tent. Oh well. Location, location, location... Even in picking a tent site. Trotter was the wise one in selecting her tent site! We packed up and began walking at 7:30. Oh my what a beautiful sunrise. Shortly into the hike .. Like 15 minutes.. I realized I had two hot spots on both feet. So.. Pack off, which sucks, shoes off.. Two pair of socks off... Then DUCT tape on!! Both big toes, both little toes and one heel. And it worked... Sweet !!We hiked 9.3 miles in 3.5 hours. We kicked ass. We were on a mission.. Trying to get to a road for a shuttle pick up for 11:15 to the Budget Inn in Hiawassee , Ga. The Budget Inn is 11 miles from the trail head. When we arrived at the road..there were some guys hitch hiking. So, a truck pulled over and I ran to the passenger window and asked for a ride into town. Because I was informed that the shuttle guy tends to run late. The driver of the truck said jump in and I'll take you into town. 4 guys and Trotter jumped into the back of the truck, Keri and I jumped into the back seat. In talking to The Caldwells , I asked if he had ever picked up hitch hikers .. ""No, never have"". I asked why he stopped for us and he said he was trying to do at least one good deed a day ! I told them they were now considered trail Angels ... We each paid $17 to stay in at the Budget inn. Upon checking in, a gentleman asked me if I was hungry... Humm,, it took me two seconds to say.. Very. ""How about some fresh ham ?"" Sure!! He told me to go to the picnic table and wait. I told Keri and Trotter to come outside. Out came Ramrod with an unopened 2 lb ham, a loaf of bread, chips, a whole sweet potato pie. The three of us made sandwiches and had pie! Trail Angel again!! Sweet. We then started our chores/- washing clothes, washing dishes, looking at the map. Upon finishing the we started walking to the grocery to purchase our next 4 days of food. Butttttt... On our way we saw a BBQ joint and decided .. Why not, let's eat again. In we went and had another full meal ??. We made our grocery bill and headed back to the hotel. But, on the way I decided I needed a haircut .. So $15 later... I have a serious short haircut. I told Keri I can't even entertain getting off the trail until my hair grows out!We are in for the evening. Keri is heading home tomorrow. She stayed longer then planned. Thanks Keri for joining me. Much appreciated. Trotter and I will march on tomorrow. We are a bit worried as a serious rain storm is on the way. We will head out tomorrow and try to make progress towards NC.

We decided to try our luck at hitching a ride to the trail head which was 11 miles from the hotel. We were out for 10 minutes when, Michelle, trail name Metaphor picked us up. What a sweetheart. She was going in the opposite direction, turned around to pick us up! Then drove 11 miles (out of her way ) to drop us off. Her brother, Troll hiked the trail in 1996 so she was very familiar with the needs of thru hikers. THANKS AGAIN METAPHOR!!We reached and crossed the GA/NC border around noon. 1 State down - 13 to go. NC started with two big climbs and very sloppy trails due to all the rain. But, we decided to push for a long day. We covered 15.8 mile in 8 hours. The ups and downs are pretty tough on the knees. As we came down the last stretch I saw a white tent and a pick up truck parked --- and I knew immediately.... TRAIL MAGIC!!! I think I started running down the mountain hoping they were not about to leave. As I arrived, Little Feet and Fifol (thru hikers from 2014) were cooking hamburgers, had beer, cokes, chips and salsa, salad, cookies... Both Trotter and I had two burgers each. They said so many people did trail magic for them... They wanted to give back. THANKS GUYS - you are both so awesome. It was a perfect way to end a long hiking day. Also, having burgers was: Giggles, Bacon (from Philly) and Summer Breeze (from West Virginia).Bacon played his travel guitar as Giggles sang songs. They were awesome. Wow what a treat. Now there are 8 tents set up for the night. We are near a creek and there is an owl that keeps calling out. Other then missing Keri on the hike... It was a great hiking day. I do have one small blister .. So I am treating that in hopes that it does not get worse. Trotter has some hip issues but she still kicks butt. She is 63 (I asked her if that was ok to share!) and she can pump out the miles. We are shooting for Franklin, NC by Sunday. That will be very doable.Thanks again for following along.

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526243,"Today is day 9 (Saturday). We started our day early...leaving Deep Gap around 7:30. It takes a little over an hour to take down the tent, repack everything, get feet ready , eat, filter water. Lots of morning chores happen prior to the start. It was quite cold and that makes it even harder to get going. Trotter and I both think we did to many miles today (for two old ladies) but we were in a tough spot deciding on stopping early or climbing Albert Mountain (5250 elevation) and then going an additional 2 miles to the first shelter. We opted to ""go for it."" Once again, the pack is kicking our butts. That additional weight plus the climb and the long hours of hiking...makes for a tough day. After 8.5 hours of hiking we make it up and over the mountain and the 100 mile mark. We stumbled into Long Branch Shelter and grabbed some floor space. By 6 p.m. there were a total of 7 hikers bedding down for the night. We all hung our food bags on the mouse proof hanging rope and tried to get some rest. But, the wind was blowing like crazy and the tempts dropped into the low 20. I had long johns, long pants, two pair of socks, three shirts and a skull cap on. I also used my mummy liner (and additional sleeping liner) inside my sleeping bag. Burrr...is all I need to say. This starts day 10 (Sunday) We departed the shelter at 8 a.m. knowing we had a short day of 7.3 mils to Winding Stair Gap. We made it there at 11 a.m. and hitched a ride into town. We are staying at a hotel tonight...washing clothes and resting our feet. Hopefully a good night of sleep will follow. Mike picked me up when I hitched a ride... and he drove 11 mile to drop me off at the Comfort Inn. I can't say enough about how nice everyone is to the hikers. Trotter was right behind me and she too hitched a ride into town. SWEET. Upon arriving at the hotel - the room was not ready so we both set up our tents in the parking lot to let them dry.

We are trying something for the first time. We are going to slack pack for 19.1 miles. That means: We will carry only essential items for a long day hike. We will leave our tents, cooking items, sleeping bags, etc... at the hotel. We are getting a shuttle ride to the trail head (Winding Stairs) and we will hike to Tellico Gap, NC.

Last night I arranged for David (a local shuttle driver) to pick us up at the hotel at 7:45. David is 90 years old and helps hikers whenever and however he can. He works on donations...no set fee. He dropped us off at Winding Stair Gap, where we left off yesterday. Today was our first slack pack day...no heavy weight - - just food, water and rain gear. WOW...what a difference. I felt like we could have run the entire trail. The weight makes such a difference. I wish I could slack pack the entire trail  The weather was PERFECT!! Cool to start but the sun came out in force allowing us to stay warm and have wonderful views. We took a few pictures at the top of Wayah Bald. Speaking of pictures - - while there is only one shown with each journal entry - - if you click on the photo tab (left side of page) you will be able to see several pictures.So back to the hike. Even with very light packs we did several climbs to 5000+ elevation. Met several new hikers and saw some that we have crossed in previous days. Everyone looks good but tired and in need of rest. It is tough getting a good night rest (at least for me).We arranged for David to pick us up at the end of our 19.4 miles so he could bring us back to the hotel. He was right on time!! And the trek to get us was not easy. While only 18 miles (via road) it took an hour. We jumped in his Jeep - - yes a Jeep - oh, he is also a HAM Radio Operator, Retired NASA Engineer, Garden Club Member, ..... As we made our way down the mountain he asked what we were going to do first - - Eat or Shower. When I said, eat....he expressed an interest in joining us. So, the three of us had a BBQ Supper. He had us laughing, holding hands to pray over the meal, doing math problems, etc... he kept us going.   What an interesting man.  We will now get our packs ready for tomorrow as we will have our true, heavy, normal load as we start our trek towards our next stopping point. We are heading to The Nantahala Outdoor Center. Things are going well but I do miss home and I miss Chrissy. I wish she were on trail with me. Hopefully, when I get to Virginia she can join me for a few days. Trotter is doing great. I think we both keep each other going.","Winding Stairs

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526568,"Today is day 12 (Tuesday).   We started the day with our 90 year old shuttle driver, David. Our drive back to the trail head was one hour. That hour was filled with David singing us gospel hymns, discussing theology, the discovery of Pluto, a stalker lady friend from church, etc.... He was all over the board. When Trotter said... David, you are quite the charmer... He said, ""why, yes I am."" He did not go over 35 mph even when the speed limit was 55... I think he really enjoys having a captive audience.. Google him: David Watters CIA. We started hiking at 9 a.m. Our plan was to hike 8.1 miles ending at The Nantahala Outdoor Center ( NOC)(near Bryson City, NC). It was a beautiful day and we only had two climbs. Sweet!! But, with full packs... It makes things a lot tougher. Both of us came off of the mountain saying... I'm mailing home XYZ to lighten my pack. Both of us weighed our packs and mine was 28.5 , Trotter's was 29. The only issue is... That was with only two days of food. When we get to the Smokey Mountain area we need to carry 7 days worth!! We both mailed home our pocket rockets (stove), cooking pot and anything we have not used. Now all of our meals will be cold. Peanut butter on tortilla bread, tuna fish in packets, beef jerky, meal replacement bars. Back to the NOC, we rented a bunk for $20. We have access to a group bathroom and kitchen. There is also a outdoor center (gear, clothing, etc) on the grounds. And, a good restaurant. To be honest I feel like all I do now is eat!! We met some new hikers today and we also ran into some that we keep seeing every other day or so. All such nice interesting folks. And, of course... Like minded. Friends and family have asked if I am having fun. The answer is: Yes and no. I love being in the outdoors, I love the challenge, I love meeting new people.... I don't love: being cold, having to unpack, repack my backpack, I don't like my shoulders hurting from carrying the pack... But, as I have said.... I will keep walking until I have enough. I hope that is in Maine but if it is VA, PA, etc... So be it. For now what I know is ... Tomorrow I will hike... It is all about one day and one step at a time. I feel like I am still learning how to actually hike this trail. I learn something new every day. I have become quite good at hitch hiking or simply walking up to someone getting in their car and explaining where I am going and could they give me a ride. Chrissy has been a help in every aspect. Not only moral support but also logistical support. In fact, she was the one who secured the bunk beds for Trotter and myself. Love her!!Several people have asked.... So how short is your hair?   Well, it might be the worse haircut I have ever had... In some places it is 1 inch and others ...maybe 2. But, actually I don't really care. The strange thing is... It is very dark .. Black! I don't ever remember having such dark hair. What is that about? Anyway... All is good. Trotter talked me into taking the top bunk because she is older and needs to go potty more then I do!! Humm??? And, the boathouse is 82 steps away.. Yes I counted! Ok. Done for the night. Not so sure if I'll have cell service over the next few days but I will post when I do. Thanks again for following along and sending nice messages. I am including a picture of s page out of my guide book so you can have an idea of how I know where things are (water, camping areas, etc.)","Tellico Gap

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526685,"Today is day 13 (Wednesday). We covered 13.4 miles today. It was quite the climb out of The NOC. The weather was nice but a bit chilly. The storm is coming in tonight with 100% chance of rain and also bringing temps in the teens. With all that we got a bunk at a local hostel for $20. So Trotter left the NOC earlier then I did as I wanted to have breakfast. I had three slices of French toast (or, lost bread, as we call it in Louisiana) and two cups of coffee. Yesterday, someone asked me if I had named my pack. My answer was no but during my hike today... I gave it a lot of thought and she now has a name . ""GEETSIE"". My family will understand but for those who don't , here is the explanation.My Mom, Margaret, AKA: Geetsie, is 86 years old. 7 years ago she suffered a stroke and has resided in an Assisted Living since that time. She is in a wheelchair and has a very difficult time communicating. Some days her words and sentences are clear but for the most part we spend a lot of time guessing what she is trying to say. My 5 brothers and their wives all live close and tend to her needs. I am the only one who lives out of state (Virginia). She also has some wonderful sitters.. And I joke with one, Doris who has become my Moms best friend. And I have begun to call her the sister I never had.Ok.. I digress .. So back to naming my pack ... GEETSIE. My Mom... And I say all of this with love, Is as stubborn as they come. If you don't tend to her, call her, include her, etc...she is letting you know about it. Every time I go home her immediate request is for me to take her riding. Put her in the car and just ride... She points in the direction she wants me to drive... And we just look at the crops growing, the flowers in the yards, we pull into our relatives driveways... If they are home, they come out and visit her while she sits in the car.So, I thought of my pack and said... I need my pack.. It supports me, has everything I need Just like my Mom did for me growing up... Supported me and provided for me. And, she loves to go with me... Everywhere, when I visit her. And there it was... The perfect pack name::: GEETSIE. I asked Trotter to name her pack. And she came up with a great one!! She named her pack, Tiny House. She made me laugh out loud with that one.","NOC

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526808,"Today is day 14 (Thursday). We covered 14 miles today. 
Last night it STORMED! I was so happy to be in a hostel. After a nice breakfast with Ms. Donna (runs the hostel) we were shuttled to the trail head. It started with a climb.. Up Jacobs Ladder. But, all in all, the 14 miles was not too bad. Trotter and I started off together but ultimately hiked our own hike. 
I saw some hikers that I keep bumping into every other day or so. But the treat was meeting a young guy with a trail name of, Monkey. And guess what... He too is from Louisiana. So of course we chatted and he knows where Bunkie is... He graduated from LSU and will start medical school this year. We talked football... Louisiana food...etc. He said he got his trail name (Monkey) because he got his food bag stuck in a tree and he had to climb to retrieve his food! 
The next big section of the hike is the Great Smokey Mountains. To be honest... They scare me a bit. The weather, their remoteness and the climbs. But, I'll stick to my mindset of.... One day, one step at a time. 
Health wise... I feel good. No issues as of this moment. 
A big shout out to Chrissy for her unbelievable support and encouragement... She rocks. 
My brothers, their families, my cousins, Aunts, Uncles, old coworkers and... New and old friends...have followed my journal. Thanks to all of you. I see all of your comments and I love reading the words. 
I have also enjoyed writing as it helps me replay my day and again it will be my diary for this journey.","Stecoah Gap

I struggled with heading out this morning but with Trotter's encouragement... We headed out of Fontana Dam at 9. We actually entered the Great Smoky Mountains around 10:30. It was a tough climb for the first 12 miles. It started snowing around 2 pm and continued for an hour. In the Smoky Mountains you are required to sleep in the shelters.... Unless full. If they are full you can tent. The shelters are three sided, stone, dirt floor, but two levels of ""platform "" space. Tonight we are in Russell Field Shelter. As soon as you make it to the shelter you do all of your chores. Empty backpack, get everything you need ... Set up your sleeping area, repack what you are not going to use and hang your pack on a nail. Then you find the water source.. Purify your water for the night and the beginning of your hike the next day. Then you eat....NOT IN THE SHELTER (due to the mice). After eating... You hang your food bag and all your trash in the tree. Some shelters have cables set up like a pully system. Tonight it will dip into the teens so I have on: Two shirts, a down jacket, a buff, skull cap, long johns, socks and down socks over that. My water filter (mini swayer) is also in my sleeping bag with me so that it does not freeze. Now... You might be wondering (because I am)... Is all of this fun? Or why do this?? Well, all I can say is.... Yes and no... But right now.., on this day... Yes, I am enjoying this journey. In a week ... I might not, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Trotter is on the bottom platform and I am on the top next to the park ranger. So he is filling me in on day to day activities. He spends 5 days in the park.. Hiking from shelter to shelter .. Sleeping in a different one each night. Then he is back home for two days.","Fontana Dam, NC

Anyway we were packed and ready to start our 12.1 mile walk to Newfound Gap. The trail was covered in snow and ICE. All was going well until I followed the wrong trail for about .5 miles before I realized I need to turn around. As I did I picked up my pace and before I knew it I had tripped and did a face plant on a rock (see pic in photos). When I realized my face was bleeding I grab snow and kept it pressed to the bridge of my nose. After regrouping ... Saying several very colorful words and expressions.. I started back up to correct my mistake. Only to see Trotter and 2 other hikers making the same mistake. One of those hikers was , Southpaw. He looked at my injury and immediately started some additional first aid. Since we could not get the bleeding to stop he took out his super glue and applied it to the gash. And it worked. Trotter was his nurse and she was instructed to blow on the glue... Which she later told me... She had not brushed her teeth and she was hoping I did not mind. After all that ... Which by the way happened right at Clingmans Dome . I woill not have fond memories of that location. Off we went with 8 more miles to hike before we reached Newfound Gap where we planned on hitching a ride to Gatlinburg for the night. I took off.. My pride and face bruised... I was making it to that parking lot. Some 3 hours later I found myself about 1/2 mile from the parking lot. I saw two ladies out for a day hike. I immediately asked if they were going to Gatlinburg... Which is a 30 minute drive from the trail head. When they said YES... I asked for a ride into town. Without hesitation they said yes. Now there are two more trail Angels.... Cynthia and Linda.! Thanks ladies you are the best. Trotter was a going to catch her own ride when she made it to the gap. Something we had already discussed. Anyway... My trail Angels gave me grapes and drove me all the way to my hotel. So very kind. Trotter caught a ride with a guy driving a pick up truck. She jumped in the back and half the way down his truck caught on fire!! After addressing that issue... He drove her into town and dropped her about .5 from the hotel. She called and we both laughed saying what a crazy day I will add that when I fell I was also saying to myself... I'm going home.. This sucks... Who's idea was this, etc. but after a shower and a great hamburger and knowing that tomorrow will be a zero day. I'm good. I'll rest tomorrow and start again on Tuesday.","Siler Shelter

With my black eye and bad haircut I thought ... Heck, I would not even pick ""me"" up. But, it all worked out and I secured two rides. Trotter on the other hand rode the trolley. I did not because I started my chores before the trolley started operating for the day. I ate three very big meals today knowing that the next three days will be tuna fish and protein bars. Oh, and summer sausage. It is 100% chance of rain tomorrow... Oh well.. Life goes on and so does the hike. We have a free shuttle leaving the outdoor center at 10 a.m. They will drop us at Newfound Gap and we will walk for 10.2 miles to the first shelter. We are still in the Smoky Mountains.. And that is the rule... Stay in a shelter or tent right next door. I will post whenever I have cell service. Oh, my face is pretty bruised... And yes, I have a black eye. Several friends have said I should come up with some amazing story as to how it happened.... Like, I fought off a bear, getting into a scuffle over sleeping space in a shelter or saving Trotter as she was falling off a cliff. Bottom line... I fell like a big klutz.

Well, it did not pass and I was sick all day. I could not keep water or food down..... I was determined to make it 15.1 miles so I could set myself up to get out of the Smoky Mountains by Wednesday. When I arrived at the shelter (6:00 p.m.) it was full with at least 40 people in and around the shelter. I could not even find a tent shot.   I saw Monkey (the young man from Louisiana) and he said, ""hey, I am up the trail about 300 yards on a flat spot and there is room for a few tents.

I keep thinking the climbs will get easier but not today...while I did have some nice stretches of flat walking the uphills were quite challenging. There were two spots that had signs indicating that if the weather was too bad you should take the blue blaze trail and not the white AT (trail) due to the hard climbs up and down and over rocks. The weather was beautiful so I stayed on the white blazes. But, the scrambles were enough to make me take my pack off...slide it down and then climb down .. it was like climbing Old Rag in Virginia. Anyway I took some good pics and will try to upload them later. My motivation for doing two long days (miles) was due to the fact that there is a new hostel that just opened with a full resupply (food and shower and a bunk) at mile marker 309. That made me put in the two long days. I am here now at Hiker Paradise .. I have had a shower, pizza in the pizza oven, clothes in the wash and the owner will take me back to the trail head (1/2 mile away) tomorrow for 7 a.m. I noticed that the forest floor is not only blooming with flowers it is also covered in pine needles. Obviously showing me that the trees I am now walking through are not the same as when I was in the Smokey Mountain and earlier. The sun is out in full force....I wish I had my hat that had the long flap to cover my ears. I am having to put my bandana in my cap and it hangs over my ears to protect them from the sun.

I did see some section south bound hikers today.

I caught up to 3 north bound hikers and we all had the same destination in mind. Whistling Gap. We shared conversation while gathering water for the camp site. All are very nice.. 2 guys.. One from Maine in his 70's. One from Kentucky ... I'm guessing 62 (ish). And one women who is only out for a few days. She said she is testing it to see if it might be something she would like to do. I had good cell service most of the day so I was able to call several of my friends and family members. And of course ... My Mom (Geetsie). With her limited speech she is still able to ask... ""Where are you now?"" Before Starting the trail, I put a map of the AT on her wall so she can see it from her chair. My family moves a little arrow pointing to my last location each time they visit. That way she can watch the progress. So today we talked about the arrow moving up... Ever so slowly. I did hear from Trotter today. She is currently sending the night in the same hostel I was in last night. So, she is one day behind me. I'm sure we will reconnect a bit later. Several people have asked about any wildlife that I have seen. I have not really seen any except I have seen several owls. They are quite interesting. Their movements are very deliberate ... Slow wing flaps, landing ever so gently on a branch and then they watch me walk. I can see their heads turning and following my movement. Pretty cool.My big climb today was to Bald Mountain. When I saw it from the distance I was thinking... Gosh I sure hope I don't have to climb up there!!! Well, I did and it provided quite the views. I'm in my tent right now ... Blogging.. And there is one serious wood pecker out there. I sure hope he moves to another tree or sleeps through the night!! Oh my... Now there are two wood peckers. Good night!","Rector Road

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528966,"Wednesday, day 27. Miles covered 13.3. Current location mile marker 342.1, Erwin, TN.I was asleep by 8:30 last night. It was a quite night as there were only 5 others camping in the same area. I woke around 5 and decided to get moving as I wanted to watch the sun rise about a mile up the trail. I had one small issue... As it was still dark out I was having a hard time finding the tree I hung my food bag!!! I had my headlight shining in every tree looking for my food. Finally after 15 minutes I found it!! Dang all those trees look alike !!I was hiking at 6...walked quickly to High Rocks where I sat, ate my breakfast bar and watched the sun rise. Perfect!! And I had a cell signal so I was able to call Chrissy ??I also contacted CH. He and I worked together and he is a very dear friend. He has been trying to meet me for several days so he could, not only see me, but provide any type of assistance he could. He has decided today is the day and he plans on driving 190 miles (one way)to meet me in Erwin, TN !! Wow! He is definitely a true trail Angel. I made it to Erwin at 11:45. Secured my room and relaxed a bit. As I was sitting on the front deck... Up walked Trail Angel CH!! Oh my goodness it was great to see a familiar face. He immediately asked what he could help me with and what I wanted to do. Guess what my response was?? You got it ... Let's go eat !! So, off we went to a local Mexican restaurant .. It was super good and I ate enough for two. Then he took me to Walmart so I could resupply (food, sunscreen, candy). From there I asked him to take me to a little diner where I could order a burger to eat later tonight. As we were driving back to the hostel he saw a Bojangles restaurant and asked if I ever had their biscuits. Nope.. But I'll try one. A box of 6 biscuits later... They are now my favorite. Yummmmmy . Now I am so stuffed... But it was all so delicious. I cannot express how much the visit from CH meant to me. It really made my heart happy and again such an example of genuine kindness. Yes, this time from someone I know ... Which even make it so sweet to know a friend of mine would do that for me. CH ... You are the best. Catching up on things and chatting about everything from his home projects, my walk, life, good food, life lessons... All good conversation with a dear friend. What a perfect day. I watched the sunrise. I walked in nature. I took a shower. I have a bed tonight. I shared the sunrise with Chrissy. I had a wonderful wonderful visit from CH. I received.. And gave.. Some wonderful hugs. On Thursday I will do what is call a flip flop. I'll hitch a ride north to Iron Mountain Gap and walk south.. Back to Erwin. This gives me a chance to see other hikers heading North and I'll be back at the hostel for another night. Then on Friday I'll catch a hitch again back to iron mountain and continue north. I am also hoping that Trotter will make it to the hostel tomorrow night so I will have an opportunity to see her again. If she does not make it here tomorrow she will definitely be here by Friday.","whistling gap

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529107,"Thursday, day 28. I covered 20.2 miles today. I walked north to south. I started at Iron Mountain and returned to Erwin, Tn. What a treat to walk in the opposite direction. I saw Sky Dawg who i met about 10 days ago. I also ran into, pound, ounce and gram. ( father, son and daughter in law). These are all folks I have met Along the way. I loved seeing them as I would not have had that treat if I were walking south to north. I think I might do that flip flop thing again down the trail. That idea was planted in my head by , 2015 Thru Hiker, Outliner. She did the same thing so I borrowed her idea. ( Thanks Outliner)The walk today was absolutely beautiful. The forest changed so many times. From open views to very dense heavy spruce trees . The summit was at 5180 feet. (Unaka Mountain). There were two locations that trail Angels were waiting with food and drink. Love them!! Oh, and remember that burger I bought yesterday to eat last night. Well, I never did eat it sooooo, I ate that for my lunch today. It was delicious !I made it back to Uncle Johnnys hostel around 3. Took a shower-- two days in a row!! A shower. Awesome! I am also washing my clothes ... That is an extra special treat. When I walked to the hostel I heard someone say, ""Hey Bunkie"" and in a hammock was Monkey drinking a beer. (Guy from Louisiana). Guess what!!! Trotter just walked up... She made it!!! I will get to see her tonight and she will share the shuttle with me tomorrow to Irin Mountain. She will do what I did today... Walk from north to south and return to uncle Johnnys for the night. I'll catch a shuttle ride from Uncle Johnnys to Iron Mountain (where I started today- walking south) but this time I'll continue on my North bound journey. The weather is calling for rain tomorrow and Saturday. While I don't really care for hiking in the rain I also know how critical it is for water supply and the terrible fires further north. A short section (I think 4 miles) of the trail is closed due to the fire. The hikers are being diverted to a fire road to cover that section. By the time I get there (VA) things may have changed. I understand it is arson. Today as I walked I was a bit reflective on how nice it was to know where I was sleeping tonight. And it made me feel extra blessed with my life. I have a home, a loving family and not a lot of worries. But I thought about folks who worry every single day about... Shelter, food, clothes, etc. I thought about my Mom and Dad, raising and providing for 6 kids. So, when I had a cell signal I called my Mom... Just to say , thanks! My Dad is deceased but I told him thanks as well. And it made me laugh a bit because I know he would be saying, honey, if you want to go to Maine I'll take you... You don't have to walk there. Marvin.. He was one of a kind and a great Dad. Now I sit in on my bunk looking at all my belongings and wondering if I really need all that food... It sure is heavy. Maybe I'll eat some of it tonight so I don't have to carry it tomorrow. Sounds like a plan to me!Oh, I woke this morning still smiling about my visit from CH. I think the next two or three days of hiking will be quite a challenge due to the rain... But I am hoping I can do at least 10 miles a day. Even though I am about 140 miles from Virginia I am getting excited because it is there that I will be able to see and spend time with Chrissy and Sammi.","Erwin, TN day 27

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529190,"This is just an update to start the day. Today makes 4 weeks that both Trotter and I have been in the trail. We chatted this morning about: is it what we thought it would be, how are we physically, mentally, do we miss home, do we think of finishing in Maine or where?, when will we reconnect, etc..Both of us agree that it has been exciting but a bit harder then expected. Not just the physical but also all the logistics that go into making this journey happen and continue. I miss home as does Trotter but I think she does not miss it as much as me. We both are thinking of the journey in segments. To think of Maine is too overwhelming. So, Trotter has decided to take a well deserved, overdue zero day today. I will march on so my go lite umbrella will be put to the test over the next few days. As I mentioned earlier my miles will be less due to the weather. And I also have a 6000 foot climb coming up. I weighed my pack this morning and it is 27 lbs which also includes my food (3 days worth) plus my water. 
Trotter will keep in touch with her family via emails while we hike separately. For anyone reading this and thinking of doing the trail.... If you do not have Verizon service it is quite difficult to use your phone...","iron mountain

Even though I was getting pounded with rain today I made pretty good time and distance. Yes, I used my hiker umbrella .. And loved it. Not much to say about the hike since it rained so much. I left Trotter at Uncle Johnny's this morning. She was going to zero (no hiking) and take care of all her chores and errands. I made it to the Roan Shelter around 3 and immediately changed out of wet cold clothes into several layers of my winter clothing. I ate, hung my best bag, got my water, purified it and it is now 5:30!! I'm in my sleeping bag blogging and chatting with Bambi, who I have seen over the past week or so. She is 19 and doing this before she starts college in New Jersey. Also in the shelter is periwinkle ... He is a triple crowner ( he has completed, the AT, PCT and CDT). He is out now just doing sections of the trail for fun. Bambi asked how old I was.. And when I said 55, she said--- oh my Mom is 55. Wow all of a sudden I felt old. Back to this shelter... It actually has 4 walls , a second floor and a DOOR!! Most shelters only have 3 walls. There are 3 of us in the bottom floor and 3 upstairs. The three upstairs are section hikers. Speedy is an older gentleman who walked up to me and said, ""do you drink?"" I said yes... And he pulled a small bottle of whiskey out of his pocket. He poured a shot for me. Now, for those of you who know me... I enjoy certain drinks but whiskey is not one of them. I tried sipping on it but I could not do it. So when he was not looking I tossed the rest into the forest. Sorry to all my whiskey drinking friends. Oh another funny that happened the other night. One of the hikers walked by me while I was sitting at my tent the other night and he said... Hey Bunkie have you seen my weed. I looked at him and said.. I don't think so but what does it look like? As he stared at me I said, maybe your dog ate it. He looked down at his dog (web) and said... Naw, he would be asleep if he did that. Ok now two more people have arrived at the shelter. Easy E.. I also know him from the last week or so. I don't know the other hiker. I warned all of them that I am a early riser so I hope not to bother them.","iron mountain

So last night there were 4 of us in the bottom floor of the shelter and 4 on the top floor. It was raining so hard and I was very happy to be in the shelter. It was cold but DRY! Everyone was in their sleeping bag by 7:30. At around 8:30 I heard some more hikers arrive but they did not come into the shelter. Instead they all hung their hammocks and slept outside. Glad it was not me!!And then it happened!! A lot of you will be grossed out... As was I ... But oh well!! At 4:30 a.m. I was half awake.. Remember it was cold so I was sleeping with my skull cap on (thank goodness) .... A mouse ran across my head! It took me half a second to realize what was happening and I jumped up as I was swatting my head. I got back in my sleeping bag and pulled it completely over my head. Yuck! But after a few minutes I was laughing and thinking... Ok if I can make it 16+ miles today my butt is staying somewhere that I KNOW I will not have a mouse on my head. I was up and out of the shelter at 7:30. It was still very cold and wet. It rained and even though I was walking through an area know for beautiful views... I saw NONE. I could only see 20 yards in front of me.. I was walking through rain clouds. The wind was so strong when I was on top of the mountains that, at one point, it almost blew me over (literally). I covered my miles and as soon as I arrived at the hostel I threw a pizza in the oven (yes I am tired of pizza but all hostels have it). I am now clean.. Washing my clothes and testing my feet. The fires have caused a lot of damage to the forest. In fact, the trail that I need to jump on tomorrow just reopened today. I will be walking through charred woods. Everything is going well so far. My feet are good. My hip is giving me a little bit of an issue but nothing major at this point. The forecast for the next few days seems to be clear so I am looking forward to that.

I had a wonderful breakfast at the Harbor Hostel. All the hikers (about 15) ate together. This place is known for their breakfast. Everyone pays $12.50 and you eat all that you can!! I packed up my belongs and was on the trail at 9 a.m. I was one of the first to leave. The weather was beautiful and I could see for miles. I could see the mountain range I came from ... Sure looked high!! I walked alone all day and the first people I saw were firefighters. They were on a gravel road (fire road) in the mountains. They said everything was clear and that none of the trail was burned but they were using the trail as their ""breaking spot"" if necessary. They took my name and said they were trying to keep track of thru hikers just In case there were others fires. I ran across one southbound hiker who started the trail last year... Did the northern section and this year he will complete the southern half. I had plans of walking about 15 miles today but I was never satisfied with locations for my tent. So I kept walking and I am glad I did. I made it to the shelter around 5:45 and there are three guys here. I put up my tent, ate a summer sausage and cheese sandwich and a cookie that I grabbed from the hostel this morning. I found a good tree to hang my bear bag and I have it marked in my head where it is!! I think it is strange how I see very few people when I hike. Those that I do come across we always chat for a minute but then move on. I do enjoy having other campers in the same area when I sleep in my tent. 4 is a good number. Two of the guys that are here tonight are sleeping in the shelter and myself and Tall Guy are sleeping in our tents. I also love when I have cell service so I can give Chrissy a call. I should be seeing Chrissy this weekend if all goes well. I am roughly 60 miles from where we will me. I might have to have some strange mileage days as one of the shelters and several miles before and after the shelter are currently restricting any camping due to bear activity.

I covered 15.3 miles today and I am currently at mile marker 426.8.As I was falling asleep last night I heard a loud crash.. Of a branch. I thought for a few and then had an awful thought of::: oh no, a bear has reached my food bag and is now having all of my food! So I got out of my tent, headlight in hand and walked over to the area of my food bag. Now, I have no idea what I would have done if, in fact, a bear was enjoying my food. But, I discover my bag still hanging in the tree .. All good! I woke around 6:30...did my morning chores and was walking by 7:30. A hiker, who arrived late in the evening, Kelsie (28 years old and has already walked the PCT), from Seattle left the camping area shortly before me. The three guys were having breakfast as we said our... See you down the trail. This is the first hiking day that I have seen the same hiker over and over. Kelsie and I kept stopping in the same area.. Not walking together but stopping at the same springs for water. In one of our conversations we decided we were both heading to the same Hostel and we would catch a ride (3 miles from trail head to hostel) together. The hike was beautiful. Be sure to click on additional photos as I have added several. The Laurel Falls area was stunning. Oh, before I forget... I did walk through a controlled burn area of the forest. I added those pics as well. The hike was not too difficult until I got to the falls area and beyond. There were so many large rocks, steps, uneven terrain .. That I noticed my feet were starting to have hot spots. That and I am in need of a new pair of shoes... Which Chrissy has mailed to my next stop. Damascus, VA. At mile 10 I was at 1900 feet and looked at the map only to discover.. I needed to climb to 3950 in two miles. So, I put my head down and marched up the mountain knowing I had to cover these miles today to set myself up for the rest of the week. Chrissy is meeting me in Damascus on Thursday .. Late afternoon. Oh, and Sammi too. I am very excited to see her. I'll take two zero days with her and then do one day of hiking with her. I have 41.5 miles to cover before seeing her. I am currently at the Braemar Castle Hostel in Hampton, TN. It is a really cool hostel and there is a small grocery/hardware store across the street. I picked up my food for 2.5 days and of course... A red Barron pizza to cook for supper. Oh my.. When I see Chrissy we are NOT having pizza. I really appreciate all of the kind words people have posted on my journal. I love reading your questions, thoughts, concerns , etc.   I am amazed at how may people are interested in this journey. I keep telling myself that no matter how far I get... I have already gained so much insight and reminders as to what is really important in life. And it all boils down to the simple things. But most importantly our loved ones.... Family, friends... Hug them all and don't be afraid to tell them how important they are to you. Even if you meet a stranger... Take the time to ask them how they are doing...

I met a few new people today at various shelters. All of the younger crowd. They all talk about the hikers in their bubble. A hiker bubble is: people that you see over and over again.. They have roughly the same pace and try to camp in the same areas. I find the younger crowd likes to hike that way. I, on the other hand, am not in a bubble. I like hiking my own pace and stopping whenever and wherever fits me best. I am currently camped in a spot by myself. My chores are complete and they are calling for rain tonight and tomorrow morning. Today while hiking , two other hikers were standing on the trail and they advised that they saw a rattlesnake. So, I took extra precaution when stepping over logs. Yikes! I also talked to two hikers who night hiked and they told me that a bob cat followed them for about 300 yards! Double yikes.

Last night I was the only one camping in my area. It was actually very nice since being alone meant I did not have to worry about making any noise early in the morning. I usually get up earlier then most. The only sleeping issue was... There was some very angry bird last night. And she talked about her anger ALL night. It could have been that I was in her space and she did not approve. So, what does one sleeping in the middle of the woods think about at 3 a.m.? Well let me tell you::I really wanted some cookies that were hanging in my bear bag.. In the tree. Do I get up.. Lower my bear bag just for cookies?? Noooo. Suck it up and go back to sleep. And then I thought.. What a great diet plan. Hang all your tempting food items in your back yard.. Making it a pain to go get it. And, I'll even sell you a bear bag... But wait, there is more... For $9.99 I'll send you an instructional video on how to hang your bear bag! Not sold yet... Wait, I'll even throw in some reflective tape to put on the outside of your bag so you can find it in the middle of the night with your flashlight !! Hey... I just retired.. I need to have a second job lined up. Anyway, I was up and out of my campsite at 7:05. I walked .5 mile and came upon stationary trail magic. I know , a new term for you guys! Well, that means people leave ice chest , usually close to a road crossing, filled with drinks and snacks. Mine was an ice chest placed by a group of 9 and 10 year old girls--- as a church project. Sweet. Then I hiked through private property (see photo link)... It was a cow pasture. The owners work with the AT and allow hikers to utilize their property. Gates and fence crossing are placed at the beginning and end of the pastures. Very cool. I was not sure how far I was going to hike today but knew that I need to arrive in Damascus no later then 11 on Thursday. That is when Chrissy is due to arrive. When I was 6 miles out...I figured.. What the heck. Get into town, wash clothes, take a shower and rest till she arrives. I crossed several hikers that I saw yesterday. It is actually the first time I have seen several familiar faces two days in a row. All very nice guys and gals. My plans are to zero on Thursday. Chrissy and I will do 13 miles on Friday. I'll zero again on Saturday. And start out again on Sunday when Chrissy goes home. I am so happy that she will be able to spend a couple of days with me. And, Trotter called! She is scheduled to arrive into Damascus on Saturday. So, she will meet Chrissy. I am glad she is getting closer.. That woman is amazing. I am staying at a hostel in Damascus... Woodchuck hostel. Pretty cool place. . I wanted to add... All hostels are on the honor system. There is food, extra things.. Washing clothes, etc. and when you leave you simply say...

I decided to ""go cold"" (no stove) around the beginning of NC. I have not missed it. But I did ask Chrissy to bring it in case I decide to carry it again. So, my cold food consist of: peanut butter, tuna fish, summer sausage , spam, bread, lots of high protein bars, cheese , almonds and candy bars. I usually carry CheeseIts ...

I have one hiking ""outfit"" and one clean outfit to sleep in. Two pairs of hiking socks, one pair to sleep in (3 total). One pair of hiking shorts.. But, I'll switch to running shorts...

Then Chrissy, Sammi and I walked the AT back to Damascus. That means we walked southbound and NOT northbound. This makes it easier to return to our original location where we had Chrissy's car. Chrissy was a true trooper.... we started out thinking we were going to walk 13 miles but as we drove to the drop off point we decided to ""add a few miles"" - - yikes!!! For her to do 17.2 miles in 7.5 hours was outstanding. And Sammi...she never slowed .. I loved having Chrissy on the trail with me. She learned a lot about what my days are like, she met a lot of hikers that I both knew and some that I did not. It made the day so enjoyable.

Making it to Virginia is a big deal. NOW.... Virginia has roughly 500+ miles of the AT passing through it. So, hikers spend a lot of time walking through Virginia. Virginia has more miles of the AT then any other state. Someone asked me about my base pack weight... It is roughly 25 lbs... then I add food and water.

I ran into Monkey (the guy from Louisiana) ... he too was staying at Woodchucks Hostel.   I saw several hikers that I have seen over the past few weeks - - some I know their names (trail names) but most, we just say hello and ask how things are going. On another note: When Chrissy picked me up and we checked into the hotel I found that I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the choices of clothes. I had asked that she bring some items that I might want to use during my hike. But, as I looked at everything - - it made me realize how little one really needs. I have talked about this before but when I saw all the choices . .. and knowing that I was doing fine with what I had - - it made me pause and reflect, once again, that life can be simple or as complicated as we make it. Don't get me wrong I love nice things and the fact that I do have choices but being on the trail for 30+ days makes me look at things a tad differently. Back to food: Once again I feel like I have too much food for the next section. I have extra spam as it has more calories and is easy to pack. I am sending my stove back with Chrissy. She brought it as I thought I might reconsider and want to start using it again. But, I really don't want it. Again, that may change down the trail but for now I don't really want to cook - - I rather eat my summer sausages, peanut butter, bread, bars, etc... That works best for me (at this point). As I look at the next few days, I see that the elevation goes up to 5000+ feet for a bit but then stays in the 2 and 3000 foot range. I googled, the hardest sections of the AT, and when I saw that there were 7 listed and I have only crossed one of those my reaction was, ARE YOU KIDDING. OMG... But, then I realized that I should not even bother reading the information and just plan on hiking one day at a time - - -as I have tried to do since starting the trail. Again the entire trail is too much for me to grasp. I have to look at it in small sections.I too read trail journals and I have noticed that a few folks that I am following (reading) have decided to go home. Anyone who has done any part of the trail or the entire trail knows that taking one step or 5 million steps (what that say it takes to complete the trail) has succeeded. Each hiker hikes their own hike and stops where they see fit. Hats off to all the hikers who stepped one foot on the trail.I had the pleasure to spend time with 2012 Thru Hiker Woodchuck (who owns the hostel) and in our conversation he said, the trail was life changing for him. When I asked him to expound he said that he realized what life was really about and that it was the simple things that made him happy. So, when he went back home (Montana) he longed to be reconnected to the trail. He had fallen in love with the town of Damascus, Va, while on his hike, so he looked for property and purchased the hostel 3 years ago. He also told me that the key to the trail is to have PATIENCE. He advised that if you are not flexible with your ""schedule"" you will never make it. Things very seldom went as planned while he hiked.... when he took it one day at a time and accepted whatever came his way - - rain, a missed trail marker, cold, hot, not enough miles covered, etc...he was more at peace on the trail....Love to all my family back in Louisiana. I think of you all every day.","Mile marker 487.2

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530858,"Today is day #38, Sunday. I covered 15.1 miles and I am currently at mile marker 502.3. (Wise shelter). It was a tough day for me. A tad emotional. I said goodbye to Chrissy and Sammi. We had a great visit and I am lucky that she was able to take two days off! When I started hiked... It was raining and I had a pretty big climb to make in the first 3 miles. I think the combination of having to say goodbye to Chrissy, hiking in rain, uphill and my pack felt heavy.... I started felling sorry for myself . Not a good thing when you are in the middle of the woods walking over rocks and roots. I was able to call Chrissy and she helped clear my head and my negative thoughts. I walked into the Grayson Highland State Park area and was disappointed as I did not see any wild ponies. For those of you not familiar with this area it is a really cool park that has hundreds of wild ponies roaming its boundaries. Anyway... Just when I thought, where are all the ponies? They appeared. It made my heart smile as I am a big horse lover. I took my pack off snapped a few pictures and moved on. My attitude continued to improve. Then I crested an area and I hear... Hey Bunkie!! There was Forest. He was with me about a week ago in the shelter when the mouse was on my head. He was standing there with his parents who came to visit him from Atlanta. They also brought trail magic!! So, two brownies, two oranges and one sandwich to go...later, I was off walking again. The trail became a bit more relaxed as did my mental state ). I planned on doing 15 miles today. After making it to the shelter I thought, briefly, about walking 7 more miles but I decided to STOP and enjoy the company of 4 guys who are at the shelter. Two are section hikers and two are thru hikers. I will not use my tent tonight as the weather is calling for big rain. So, I'll be on the shelter platform. I have already seen one mouse so I am hoping he does not bother me tonight. Yuck!Oh... And a big day. I hit the 500 mile marker. Sweet.","Mile marker 487.2

I slept well last night even with the symphony of snoring going on around me. There was a total of 7 in the shelter last night. I was up and walking by 7 a.m. After my not so good day yesterday I was determined to have a better day. I was 1 mile into the walk when I saw one of the wild ponies and that definitely made me smile. The threat of rain loomed all day. I felt like I was trying to beat the clouds over the mountains. I ran into Forest, his parents gave me the trail magic yesterday. He was on his phone on top of a mountain. Smiling, he said to me, ""I love when I can call my friends!"" To me, being able to stay in touch with family and friends is very important. It keeps me ""involved "" with home and it allows me to share my day to day progress with Chrissy. When I don't have cell service I do have a ""In Reach"" emergency device that allows me to sent a text message to Chrissy using satellites. I walked extra today because I am trying to reach Atkins, VA tomorrow. But, with the weather I am not so sure how tomorrow will play out. I ran into a mother and daughter who are doing a thru hike together. I thought that was really cool. I am camping alone tonight. All my chores are done and I am hunkered down in my tent as it is pouring!! I had tape on my feet the last two days and when I removed the one from my big toe I discovered I have a pretty good blister. I'll re tape before I head out in the morning. UGH.

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531214,"It rained all night...when I heard it break around 5:30 a.m. I decided to pack everything and hit the trail. I was walking at 6:45 and my pack was weighing extra due to all the rain. To explain... yes, my tent is waterproof but I have a rain fly over the tent and that obviously gets wet (but keeps me dry). My clothes, from yesterday, were soaking wet as well. All of that goes into a garbage bag to keep it away from my dry stuff. But, I think you get the picture - - things are WET and HEAVY. My goal was to make it 7 miles by 9 a.m. That would put me at the Mt. Roger Visitor Center. There is a shuttle bus that picks up hikers at 9, 11 and 2:30. It brings you into Marion, VA allowing you to resupply food, etc. Well, at 9 a.m. I arrived at the center and saw several hikers there. I asked, are you guys waiting for the shuttle? There reply: Oh, the shuttle just left. OH no... OH well... not much I can do but wait. I went into the visitors center bought a coke and went back out. One of the hikers then said - - hey, I have a phone number of a guy who, I was told, likes to help hikers out if you want to give him a call. Sure, I said. Got the number walking around the parking lot until I could get a cell signal. A woman answered the phone and she told me she would come get me but she was busy and that she would call her husband, Jim. And that she would call me right back. OK, great but I don't have good cell service. She said that she would call me on the phone located on the building. Sure enough 10 minutes later, Carrie called me. She said, Jim (her husband) would be there in 20 minutes. GREAT!!!! 20 minutes later up drives a van! My ride to town. I get in and he asked where I needed to go. I am not sure....it looks like the weather is breaking so I should get back on the trail to take advantage of this break. But, I need food so lets go to the grocery. On the way I asked how far Atkins was from Marion. OH, about 8 miles. HUMMMM. My logistical brain starting working. So I ask him - - could you bring me to Atkins where I will secure a room at the Relax Inn (Yikes). But I would then need a ride back to the visitors center so I could complete that 11 miles section of the hike (from Marion to ATkins). His answer - - SURE, I have all day. OMG!! Are you serious. This guy is too sweet. We first stop at Ingels (grocery store) I gather my supplies and meet him back in the van. I then ask if we can stop at McDonalds. SURE... I get three breakfast sandwiches to go. Back in the van. He drives me to Atkins. I get my room. Throw all my wet heavy stuff in the room. Back in his van. He now is driving me back to the visitors center. OH NO... I forgot to pick up bars (protein bars). NO PROBLEM... we stop AGAIN at the grocery. I run in pick up my bars and back in the van. We made one other stop at the dollar store to check for items but they did not have what I needed. I add this because he went into the store and bought a few things and..... he gave me some candy treats and said - - for your hike today. Again... what a sweetie. In our conversation I found out the his son, Spark, hiked the trail in 2014 and so many people helped his son this is a way of giving back. He asked that I sign his log book as he keeps track of hikers that he helps. I am number 51 for this year. Last year he helped over 135 hikers!! Now you may be thinking that sounds like a pretty good little business. Well, here is the kicker. He does this FREE OF CHARGE. He spent 2 hours with me...running me from here to there and back - - for FREE.   So, I look back and know that I missed the shuttle for a reason. It was to have the wonderful experience of Trail Angel Jim (and his wife Carrie). I was smiling the rest of my hike. I stopped and chatted with other hikers and I told them about my experience as though I had just received a new bike for Christmas (when I was 9). I am still in awe of his kindness. So, now I am at the Relax Inn drying out all my gear and watching the weather. Looks like a bad week in Virginia. But, I will hike on tomorrow as I do not want to sit out a day. I just saw another hiker that I know. Luna (Tic) is his name. And he and I will walk down the road a bit to have dinner together. He has hiked the trail once but has decided to do it again. That blows my mind. He is hiking with a dog, Berkley. So, I get to pet and get my dog fix while I am in the same area of Tic. Oh... one more thing. When I was getting out of the shower (remember i am in the RELAX INN) .. the water will not turn off. I get out of the shower and as I am turning the handle ... it comes off. Humm... OK, now what... I jam it back on - -and turn as hard as I can. There that worked.. OH my... always an adventure.","mile marker 525.5

She supports me 100% in chasing this crazy dream. But it is not easy on her. She works crazy long hours, takes care of Sammi, handles all the house issues... And since I have left for this walk we have had a leak in the basement, a storm that has caused some tree issues in the back yard, now she has to make some additional arrangements for Sammi. It just seems like everything is happening at once. When I say... Hey, I'll come home, this is not fair to you.. Her response is/- no, I've changed the locks you can't come home, that bad haircut you got-- well it has not grown out enough for you to come home, etc. So, big hats off to Chrissy she is the one that is my hero and the one who deserves an ""at a girl- you are amazing.""Today is day 42. I covered 20.2 miles and I am currently at mile marker 574.1. I checked the weather and decided to give to a go and gamble on how the day would try out. Not a wise decision. It started out fine but it did not end that way. This is my day: I started walking at 8:10. Nice start through some cow pastures. Another hiker, Zack started right behind me. As we entered the forest and not far removed from the pastures I kept hearing some sounds that I could not place. I decided it was a cow, from the pasture, in some sort of distress.. But I was not sure. I even stopped walking and try to figure out what it was because I heard it 5 times. When I made it to the first shelter I stopped to get a snack and Zack walked up. I asked if he heard the noise. Our conversation: (zack) oh, did you hear that? (Me)Yes, I think something was wrong with a cow. No, it was not a cow it was me throwing up!! What ? Are you ok? Oh yea, I throw up every morning! WHAT? Yea, it is from me smoking so much. Really, have you thought about quitting? No, not really. Oh.. Ok. Well, have a good hike. I am baffled by that but whatever. I'm just glad there was not a sick cow!!So I kept walking keeping in mind that a couple I met from Baton Rouge were slightly ahead of me. And I knew that they were catching a ride to another one of those Bates Motels on the side of the road. I thought if the weather really turns maybe I'll do the same. I hiked about 13 miles and OMG it started snowing when I got to Chestnut Knob, elevation 4393. At first I was thinking this is cool.. It is lightly snowing. But then... It became a whiteout!! And I was freezing. And then I remembered I had sent my heavier clothing home with Chrissy! Oh no! I had caught up with the Baton Rouge folks who have trail names, The Bean and JotC ( stands for Jesus off the cross). He was given that name by his mom who said ... He would make her so frustrated at times that it was enough to knock Jesus Off The Cross. Anyway... I told them I really did not want to camp in the weather so I arranged to shuttle with them to the motel. It kept snowing all the way down the mountain... Meaning the tempts never warmed. Bubba, the shuttle guy was waiting when we arrived at the cross roads. Tomorrow we will shuttle back to our exit point and start again. The weather seems to be looming over this area. I'll watch it again tomorrow... Just because that is what I do I have added several new pics to the photo log.

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531715,"I am at mile marker 590.7. I covered 16.6 miles.   I was leaving my room this morning when I heard someone call out my name. It was Whisper, a woman I met in Damascus. She is 60 years old and hiking with her dog Boomer. We chatted and she asked if I was coming back to this hotel. This particular area you have access to the town (Bland, Va) from multiple trail points. I told Whisper I had planned on hiking out and she said.... Well, if you want to share a room tonight I'm staying because I am waiting on a box from home. Hummmmm... That means I could slack pack (leave heavy stuff in her room and only carry food, water and rain gear... And it is going to rain tonight!! Guess how long it took for me to say, YES! SURE.. Sounds awesome to me. I threw my heavy stuff in her room and jumped in shuttle with The Bean and JotC (Baton Rouge couple). We were driven back to the trail head where we exited yesterday. Bubba was our shuttle driver. I day shuttle.. But that simply means someone with a car, truck, van that will bring you where you need to go. Anyway I am going to paint a picture of Bubba for you... Because, as I have eluded to before I continue to be pleasantly surprised on this journey. When Bubba picked us up yesterday.. It was on a dirt road, it was raining/snowing, he was standing outside his van, camouflage shorts, hat on backwards, smoking a cigarette, unshaven, not very talkative.. Just get in the van and head out. This morning when he picked us up and we had the chance to really chat with him. WHAT A SWEETHEART!! That gruff Bubba is a big teddy bear. He told several very heart warming stories but my favorite was: he shuttled a mom, father and their 6 year old son, last year during their hike. It happened to be The Saturday before Easter when he brought them to the hotel. That night Bubba went to the Dollar store and bought a Easter basket, filled it with candy.. On Sunday morning he went to the hotel early , put the basket in front of the room door where he knew the family was staying. He knocked and hid behind the car. The young boy opened the door and saw the basket!!! The father was extremely grateful and told Bubba that his son had asked... How will the Easter Bunny find me? And the Dad had said... Don't worry he will find you. Just perfect!! Bubba told stories about how much he enjoys doing what he does because of all the folks he gets to meet. I told him it is people like him that continue to brighten my every day. I already have 5 big brothers but... Bubba would be another great big brother if I ever needed one. So back to the hike. I saw so many different colors today. So many greens... Bright, dark, faded... Flowers blooming... Oh, and lots of mud. Major mud due to all the rain hanging around. I was able to cover my miles pretty quickly due to the light pack and no serious climbs and... I knew it was scheduled to rain mid afternoon. By 3:45 me and Baton Rouge folks were in the van... Yes, with Bubba, heading back to our hotel.. Big Walker Motel in Bland, Va. Home for one more night. Tomorrow, Whisper, Boomer and I will hit the trail between 7 and 8. On a side note: I have talked about food quite a bit. Well, today I dipped my pop tart in my peanut butter.... Delicious!!! And great calories... Which I need plenty of on a daily basis. To answer a few questions: how do I keep my phone charged on the trail.. I have a battery pack that can charge my phone (roughly) 5 times. How long are my hiking days: on average between 8 and 10 hours a day.","mile marker 574.1

I will start to include a list of some points that I pass during the day as a friend has asked for this info as she follows along. I passed: helveys mill shelter, VA 611, Jenny Knob Shelter, VA 606 (Trent grocery).This morning, before Bubba picked up Whisper, Boomer and myself , I walked about 1/4 mile to get a cup of coffee at 5:30. I have not really missed coffee while I have been on the trail but... I was awake and I figured.. What the heck! I also picked up a honey bun and some other sweet pastry. I shake my head at some of the stuff I eat. It is just crazy but I crave it and the calories keep me going. Today the weather, one again, calling for rain but (so far) I have only had about 30 minutes of on and off showers. I hope I can say that in the morning as well. I am camped along side a beautiful creek and I am the only one here. I have come to enjoy camping in solitude. Mainly because I don't want to worry about bothering others if I wake early and want to pack up my gear. That can be create quite a bit of noise. I have been struggling with shoulder pain/issues almost every day since I began this walk. I keep thinking... I just need to walk and I will become used to my pack, etc. But, I am beginning to think I either have something going on in my left shoulder or??? I am now asking other hikers how they pack their packs, what issues they are having, etc. what I have discovered is that there is NO hard and fast rule that: heavy weight should be at the bottom, middle, top of pack. Some keep it at the bottom, a lot keep it in the middle and a few keep it at the top. Today I stopped and repacked my pack three times. Testing every theory. Jury is still out on my decision but I am leaning towards-- sleeping bag at bottom, heavy stuff (food, clothes) next, then all the other miscellaneous items all the way up. One would think by now I would have this figured out... But I don't! Today I met Hashbrown and his dog Molly. Hashbrown had a raccoon hide and he was cleaning it. So of course I asked... And he said that Molly had caught and killed it so he skinned it to made something out of the hide. I will include a pic in the photo log. A first for me on the trail!!I also ran into a hiker who stayed at one of the hostels I was in 3 days ago. When she told me that she actually stayed a second night at the hostel I asked how the heck she did all those miles to be where she was today. She laughed and said...oh, I skipped 36 miles so I could catch up to my friends. Ha... Once again proving that everyones journey is different. As is life!Oh, as you can see by my mile marker... I passed the 600 mile mark. That is hard for me to believe. 600 Miles!! Shout out to an old colleague and friend, Fran D. She lives in Hawaii...and as she has followed my journal she has sent two wonderful care packages to Chrissy who will in turn get the items to me on the trail. She sent a box full of macadamia nuts... And as she said in her note... There is enough for all my friends and even enemies (ha). Then when she read I was eating SPAM... Well, we all know that spam is extremely popular in Hawaii so guess what she sent ....a box full of spam... Spam bites, spicy spam, spam in a can, spam in the individual sleeves, you name it...

Two person, the one person tent is too small. The guthook AT app. Cost $60 but well worth it. It pinpoints exactly where I am and I can locate all the water sources.

My hair is growing out (Bill M no comment!) and I might even need another cut pretty soon. Shout out to my dear friend B.T. Happy Birthday!! And to my brother Gordon//- YES, I am still in Virginia!! Also, my brother Jordan who is following me daily--- I will keep going!! Theresa M....think of you daily! Oh, side story-- a hiker showed me a picture of a rattle snake that she saw on the trail. It was sooo big. Reminded me of a story from my youth that had me laughing while walking. My Dad had killed a rattle snake and wanted to take it home to show others and cut off the rattles. I was riding in the back of his truck... He threw the snake in the back -- with me!!! Well, as he was driving through the fields towards the house the snake--- was NOT dead and when he started moving you never saw a 9 year old little girl fly on top of the truck... So fast. The next thing I knew I was looking at my Dad through the windshield telling him to stop that the snake was still alive. He slowed ... Stopped... Laughing at me the entire time.... Anyway... I am off to sleep. Tomorrow I think I will hike! It is Thursday--- I woke to a dry tent. OMG I am one happy hiker. And my friend Keri ( who started the hike with me) is meeting me today for a couple of days hiking.","666.8

She is kicking my butt each and every day. But, tomorrow I will hike!! I passed Audie Murphy Monument, pickle branch shelter and Dragon Tooth. Dragon tooth took it all out of me... I was climbing...then I was sliding on my butt down rocks that were too steep to climb down. I did sleep well and as I stated... I packed a dry tent. That was a real treat. Ahhhh the simple things!I was walking at 6:50 because I knew I had a 3000 foot gain in the first mile. I loaded up on water and peanut butter and one protein bar. By 7:45 I was sweating through and through.... And YES I wear the same clothes every day. Why? Because within 10 minutes I am either soaked from rain or sweat. But heck... Who cares. We all smell the same--- very very bad. And we can recognize each other from a distance based on our clothes. I kind of like that. I thought today would be easier since I knew I only had 15 miles. Boy was I wrong. The good news was the fact that it did not rain until 30 minutes after I made it to the hostel. And guess what... Guess... Yep it hailed AGAIN! But this time I was watching it from inside. Again.. The simple blessings. Keri was picking me up at the hostel at 4 so I had time to shower and wash clothes.. Good for me but even better for Keri. She will hike with me tomorrow and Saturday and then I will take a zero day on Sunday --- sweet--- all of it --- Keri hiking with me and the upcoming zero day. So last night I was trying to put some medicated powder on my feet but did not realize I was getting some on my sleeping bag. UNTIL I was trying to sleep and all of a sudden I was totally stopped up and could not breath. What the heck?? Then I discovered.. Maybe I am sensitive to the powder. I had to turn my sleeping bag inside out and then flip the top to the bottom.. And then I could breath. Lesson learned. I am now at a howard Johnson hotel with Keri. Tomorrow, Homer will pick us up and bring us to the trail head. We have 2 days to cover 27 miles and then Keri will head home. Should be fun as we will hike to McAfee Knob, the most photographed spit on the AT. All else is good... Oh, I obviously hit the 700 mile mark.","686.7

Gosh what a difference good weather .and good company makes. There is a bear issue in this area so we are very restricted on camping options. Today we can only walk 10.3 miles. Or we could do 20 and that is not happening. So, let's talk about our stay last night at the HoJo. I actually look forward to the stories that come out of my hotel stays. The room had a no smoking sign but OMG... There had been smoking in the room. Oh well.. It had a bed and shower... So I can get over that. Watched a little TV catching up on the news... Always interesting. Around 10... Guess what I hear?? Just guess!! Yep, the guy in the room next to me... SNORING.. And I can hear him. I actually laughed and thought of this story:: A friend of my father, Buster B, is following my journal. When I previously spoke about people snoring he told one of my brothers... ""Well, you tell Amy that Marvin (my Dad) snored with the best of them. And that whenever my Dad took Buster to the fishing camp he kept everyone up... With his snoring."" So now, I will embrace everyone who snores and think of it as a sign that my Dad is near. That makes my heart smile. Moving on. Keri and I woke at 6:30 brushed our teeth and went straight to Bojangles!! CH turned me on to their biscuits when he came to see me in Erwin. Thanks CH!! Went then packed our gear and waited for Homer to pick us up. And what a treat it was meeting Homer. I just love meeting and talking to the shuttle folks. Homer is 74. He, his wife and two kids hiked the trail in 2002. He had a book in his car that someone published about their hike. He was married on top of McAfee knob 29 years ago!! And every anniversary he and his wife hike to the knob and have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. PERFECT! Ok... We finally started walking at 9! Late for me but hey... Meeting Homer was worth it. We made it to a road crossing and there was a news crew ( channel 10 out of Roanoke, Virginia). They asked if they could interview us regarding the trouble with bears in the next section. We first said, no. But the young lady asked again and we agreed. It was kept short... And then we moved on. The hike was so calm compared to what I have been doing. A welcome treat and I am so happy for Keri. Now since we have time to kill ... We are sitting, shoes off hanging out on top of the knob. We will cover 10.3 miles today and 15.4 tomorrow to make it back to Daleville. Oddly i feel a bit guilty about taking such a break in the middle of the day. This is a first in 50 days. I need to let that go and embrace the good company and wonderful weather. We will camp at Campbell shelter where there will be lots of other hikers due to the restrictions I spoke of. Also, someone who is following my journal, from NH, wrote and told me that a hiker in the smokey mountains was bitten, by a bear, while he slept in his tent. OK that info and it being Friday the 13... I will follow the rules and NOT camp where the rangers have said, ""no camping."" Even if slowing down sometimes causes me to get antsy. I need to remember what Woodchuck told me.... Patience is key to doing this trail !!! Ahhh- the lessons I continue to learn.","701.8

We started walking at 6:40 and finished at 2. Keri and I stayed at the Campbell shelter camping area due to the bear activity further into the trail. There were roughly 20 hikers tenting in the same area. In Virginia there is a section of the AT that is also known as the Virginia triple crown. That includes: dragons tooth (kicked my butt) , McAfee knob (beautiful views but can be crowded), Tinker Cliffs ( more remote and beautiful views). Keri was able to hike the last two during her two days of hiking with me. We had great weather for our hike both yesterday and today. I told Keri she had to stay since she brought on the good weather. The hike was rather calm compared to what I have been doing and that too was a very welcome change. Today, Keri heard a strange noise and looked down to see a rattle snake sitting on the trail shaking his rattles. It scared the !!!!! Out of her but what does she do??? Stops, puts her pack down, takes out her phone to take a pic (check photo log). Brave girl. And where was I ?? Sitting on a rock, waiting for Keri to catch up, watching a black (rat) snake traverse the trail (see pics). Mine was a calm visit with a snake hers was... Well let's just say/-- I know a lot of folks who would be off the trail going home!! I met one hiker today who showed me a picture of a BIG black bear that he saw while walking near the restricted camping area. The crazy thing is the Bears are NOT shying away from humans... And that is the scary part. After our hike we had a great Mexican meal and now (6:30 pm) we are both in bed watching TV and looking forward to a good night sleep. Keri will go home tomorrow and I will do my chores; wash clothes, logistics for the next week, ""make"" groceries (that is what we do in Louisiana) and we also ""save"" (put them away) our groceries.Geetsie (my Mom) follows my journal with great anticipation... My sister in law, Donna, reads the journal to her when she visits. Another sister in law, Tricia, prints the pages so Mama can look at the pages and pictures. Thanks!!!

But, before she left we went to Bojangles for breakfast. I worked on cleaning gear, logistics, grocery shopping, watching TV, eating and more logistics! My feet have bothered me over the last few days so I purchased a new pair of shoes yesterday. I hope this does not cause me issues. I am a bit nervous about walking in new shoes. Fingers crossed on that one. I looked at my next week of walking and dang if it ///- the trail still has lots of big climbs and steep down hills. Virginia has been just as difficult as the previous states. Chrissy will try to met me next weekend if the logistics work. I'll try to cover 18 to 20 miles a day to make that happen.

I began walking at 6:50 and stopped at 5. My new shoes are good but my feet hurt from the miles. I am trying to play this weather system and make it to shelters so I don't have to set up my tent in the rain. Or more importantly pack and carry a wet tent. I was going to stop at Bobblets shelter but it was to early in the day. The hike (terrain) was pretty calm today. My next three days will have some big climbs so it is good that I got a few extra miles in today. I am in the shelter with two guys and i expect a few more hikers to show up a little later. Today i struggled with the mental aspect of being in the trail. This has happened twice...to this extent. And when I arrived at the shelter, one of the hikers told me he has decided to leave the trail. I immediately said, oh no, it might not be good for me to hang around you .. Since I am battling some of those same thoughts. We chatted a bit and he said he misses home and he feels as though he has walked his walk and is proud of his efforts. I gave him a big hug .....Trotter made it to Daleville two hours after I left this morning. I was sorry we missed each other. Ironically she is sharing a room with Whisper and Boomer.

I slept very well in the shelter last night. I was feeling so blessed to be in the shelter as it began raining early. I also slept next to Theo (golden retriever) (see pics). He is such a sweet dog. As is his owner, Sojo. I was packed and ready to go by 6:30 but Ferrell and I decided to wait on the rain . After an hour of waiting we gave up and decided to hit the trail. We walked 3.2 miles to a cross road and then made it to the campground. Ferrell and pop tart are catching a shuttle into town. Ferrell will stay there till his wife arrives on Saturday and then he will go home. Pop tart will take a day off tomorrow and start again on Thursday. I have decided to stay at the campground... There were no available cabins but the owner said I could sleep in the recreational room. SWEET!!! That means I am out of the rain for the day and evening. They have a small kitchen and offer meals. I have already had; eggs, bacon, toast, potato chips, coffee and a coke. I'll order lunch in a few and supper later??. I have had a shower, washed my clothes and I am now watching an old Robert Redford movie. Life is good right now. I had to convince myself that it was ok to take a very very short day. I did that by saying.... Ok over the past 2 days I have covered 28.2 miles and that helped me. I know... Crazy but it is what I needed to do to accept my decision. I spoke to Trotter this morning and she is taking a zero in Daleville--- mostly due to the weather. I could have shuttled there to spend the night with here but logistically staying at the campground is much wiser. Time wise. And, I have everything I need here... Especially the meals and dry room. While I have eluded to the fact that, other then Trotter, I have not really ""walked"" with anyone else during my time in the trail. So, of course, Ferrell and I had an immediate connection. Even though we just met yesterday and only walked 3.2 miles together... It was very enjoyable. When he hugged me goodbye... He told me, the exact same thing that I was thinking. He said, ""there are not many people, that you know immediately, upon meeting them, that you will be friends for a long time.""   Yes, it brought tears to my eyes! And I said, please reconsider ... And walk at least to Harper's Ferry, WV (the unofficial halfway point of the trail). He said it sounded tempting but he feels good about his decision to leave, the trail, and he feels good about his walk. Hats off to him!! I am very happy for him. Sojo and Theo (hiker and his dog) are here at the campground but he needs to move on because he is meeting family in a few weeks to celebrate his 75th birthday. I told him he could leave Theo with me but he did not agree to that. Well, it was worth a try!Tomorrow I will hit the trail again. The rain will be here all night and early morning. So, I'll have breakfast and then head out. I too need to cover some miles as Chrissy is planning on meeting me on Saturday if everything works out. It is hard to lock plans down due to the unforeseen things that happen every day. I am looking out of the window as I type this and I feel go grateful to be inside...

Yesterday, I only hiked 3 miles and then planted myself in a recreational room at a camp ground. I ate all day long and watched old movies. At 5 ish a man came into the room, eating an ice cream cone. He said, hey, where is the pool table that was in here last year. I don't know, I'm just here to avoid all the rain and the owner said I could sleep on the couch. He sits down... And we start chatting. He tells me that his wife, I Believe, thru hiked in 2014, and they come back to help other hikers. He said he was retired from a fire department out of Louisiana. I start grinning because I can't wait to tell him... I'm from Louisiana. He finishes his story and I say: I'm from Louisiana and my name is.... He interrupts me and says... Don't tell me (your name) ... But before he could shut me up... I say, my name is Bunkie. He says, So you are Bunkie!! Wait I have to get my wife... Sherri get in here, guess who this is!!! It is Bunkie! Now, I am sitting there wondering.. What is happening.. He told me they had been following my journal!! So of course, like any good fellow Louisiana folks.. There was an immediate connection. We continued our visit and he told me they were staying in a cabin at the campground. He also advised... If he was awake early ( today- Wednesday) he would come to the recreational area and see if I needed a ride to the trail head. I was awake at 5:30 , trying to be quite, as two other, very wet hikers, arrived and were sleeping on the floor. I walked outside around 6:15 to find --- it was RAINING. Not bad but it was still raining. I looked towards the cabins and what do I see... Jimmy walking to his truck and then driving my way. When he arrived he had two maps and said..... How about slack packing today? I'll refresh you memories--- if any ask if I want to slack pack/ it takes me about a half a second to say, YES!! Before I knew it I was sitting in his truck talking over logistics. He gave me a smaller back pack to put my day items and he put my big pack in the back of his truck. He explained--- ok, I'll met you at several points, I'll tie ribbon on the trees at the road crossing.. If it is one ribbon... Remove it and keep walking, if it is two ribbons, stop there and wait for me. Ok, I can do that!! I start walking-- again with a grin on my face that won't stop. I am wondering.. How lucky am I !! Wow... If I had not cut it short yesterday I would not have met, Jimmy and I Believe.. Pinch me!! Anyway.. I make great time and as I get to road crossing... The ribbon is there... I keep moving!! At about 13 miles in... There are two ribbons. I stop.. Wait about 10 minutes and up drives Jimmy and I believe. They put me in there truck... And we pull off the road a bit. They have food and drink for me!! Then we begin discussing... Mileage and choices. Jimmy says... In 5 miles you will hit Petites Gap... I'll be there waiting... Or you could keep going but there will not be another exit until you have walked 28+ miles. Ok, for those of you who know me--- well..... What do you think I said? Yep, I'll go the long route... I wNted to take advantage of the light pack!! Jimmy says... Ok, are you sure? YEP! So off I go.. Knowing I needed to make great time because they were also helping another hiker but he was 5 miles ahead of me. When I got to Petites Gap.. There was jimmy and I believe... Giving other hikers snacks and drinks. Jimmy asked if I was ok.... Yep.. I need to keep going! Well, there is a sandwich on the front seat for you!! OMG - these trail Angels are too much!! While I am eating and chatting with I Believe.. We discover that we both graduated from LSU and both taught school. Then I was off as I needed to cover 10 more miles!! Again... Still grinning.. Wondering why was I so blessed today!! All I could do was keep telling them both how much I appreciated what they were doing. All because they just want to help hikers... That they don't even know!! I made it to the rally point and there they were.. Just as planned. I met, My Friend, the other hiker they were helping. And then guess... Yep... Rain!! We got into the truck and drove into Buena Vista, Va and secured rooms at the motel. Sweet... Out of the rain. After cleaning up the 4 of us went out for BBQ. And discussed plans for tomorrow. Yep, they want to help us slack pack tomorrow as well. I am so blown away by their willingness to spend their entire day, evening, gas, money on food, etc... Just to give back to the trail and the hikers. I'm still smiling-- there is goodness, from strangers, who quickly become dear friends!! Yes, my plans are to keep hiking but if I were to leave tomorrow.. I have already received so much from the trail and so many new and dear friends ... That I would feel as though my hike was a success... Even if I did not make it to Maine. Ok... Good night.","755.7 middle creek campground

Do you know who he bought from? No, but I think they had a building located in a bad curve. Really!! Well, guess what.

He would come ever year... But I think he passed away. He went by DG .. Well, guess what.... His nephew is Jimmy, the guy who has helped me the last few days!! Come on--- really. Yep...

I cannot agree or disagree with that-- I'm just saying what I have read. I do know this/-- it was not easy. Guess what??? I am spending the night with Trotter. She is behind me in the hike but we ended up in the same motel. Sweet. Good to see her. Someone asked: What do you think about while hiking. What a good question. EVERYTHING!

Today was a fun day. It started with me saying goodbye to Trotter - -until I see her further up the trail. My trail angels; Mr. Jimmy and I Believe along with fellow thru hiker, My Friend and I traveled to mile marker 831.5 (where we exited yesterday) so we could begin our hike for the day. It was so nice being out of the rain last night. And to spend some time with Trotter. I also said goodbye to Farrell who was being picked up by his wife today. BE PROUD FARRELL - - you did AWESOME!!We started hiking at 8:30 and before I knew it - - I was climbing to 3959 feet. It is one of the last ""big"" climbs for awhile. I will be leaving the Blue Ridge area and entering the Shenandoah National Park (SNP) in 15 more miles (which I will cover on Sunday). Southern Virginia has been harder then I expected but now I can start to look at those miles in my rear view mirror and that makes me happy.Speaking of happy....I knew that after covering 10 miles today I would get to Reeds Gap where Chrissy and Sammi and my trail angles (mr. Jimmy and I Believe) would be waiting to see me. Even though the 10 miles were actually, in my opinion, tougher then the Priest, that I climbed yesterday - - I was so pumped to see my family and new dear friends that once again...I was hiking and wearing a smile! That was a good feeling. I arrived at the gap around noon...was greeted with lots of dog kisses from Sammi and a great hug from Chrissy. And....Mr. Jimmy saying, ""do you want a pepsi?"" Of course I do!!! We visited for about 15 minutes and Chrissy shared with me several bags of goodies that were sent to me by Fran D. (from Hawaii)....see picture. Thanks Fran!! I needed to cover 5 more miles to complete my day so I took Sammi and off we went to complete the next few miles together.

Today Chrissy and Sammi hiked with me.   The day started out damp, not raining, but guess what happened - - YEP… it rained. And then Chrissy said, “it was fun until it started raining and I was full of mud.” I totally agree with her - - - rain, mud, …. = NO FUN. But, here is the bright side to this story. We are now clean, dry and in a hotel room. What more could one ask for? WE are both good and have really enjoyed the day….rain and all.I have read journals over the past few years and what I notice is that every hiker talks about different things. Topics range from, but not limited to: flowers, views, climbs, weather, people, feelings, thoughts, revelations, spiritual, etc….   I was thinking, today, as I hiked, what is it that I tend to talk about? I think it is across the board what I think and talk about but what I have noticed is, it is primarily about the people I meet, on and off the trail. I find people and their stories - - hikers and non-hikers - -extremely interesting. Like today, Chrissy and I had dinner with Soda Pop and Skittles. Chrissy met them yesterday and by chance we are staying in the same hotel in Waynesboro. Chrissy was their trail angel today - - as she brought them to Wal-Mart so they could resupply while I was washing clothes. So, plans were made to share dinner together at the local Outback. We had a great meal and a delightful conversation. Lots of laughter. It is moments like that that I think I will remember…more then, the view from the top of a mountain. It is people that I may have never met if I had not started walking the trail. All the shuttle drivers I have written about, the trail angles that just appear out of nowhere …just at the right time. To some of my friends - - who are not only my friends, before the trail, but now they are a part of my trail experience (CH, for one.) And today… I ran into Conductor and Highlife (two fellow thru hikers). They needed a ride from the trail head to a hotel. Since Chrissy was here, in a car - - we were able to provide that ride to them. Something so simple - - that made their day so much better! Just a simple little ride of 4 miles! Think about that! Think about doing something nice for someone even if it seems small as it may turn out to be just the thing that makes their day, better. I think of trail angels, Mr. Jim and I Believe. The day they met me…..I was NOT happy. I was upset with the rain and I had decided to park my butt on a sofa and NOT walk another step until the weather improved. And then they came into my journey and helped me for 4 days straight. Just because they wanted too. Trail magic. Now go out there and provide a little magic to someone. Even if it is visiting someone who could use a little company.Take care…. Thanks for letting me share some of my thoughts.","847.0

This morning Chrissy brought Conductor and myself to our starting point and we both did a flip flop hike today. Meaning we walked south on the trail back to Waynesboro. We did this due to the weather and this allows us to stay in the motel one more night while still making progress on our miles.   Tomorrow (Tuesday) both of us will shuttle back to our starting point and walk north.

Enough to make me stop /-- try different things with my laces, foot strike, etc... I made my miles and I am now putting ice on it. I am keeping my fingers crossed that I wake up tomorrow and it feels better. As for the hike today... Even though it did rain, it was not much. I love doing a flip flop hike to see folks in front of me. I saw some hikers that Chrissy gave trail magic to. I also saw, Layers, Elle, Chrome, Astro... All hikers I have met in the past. Tomorrow, if my foot feels ok, I'll leave the hotel around 10, with Conductor. The plan is to cover about 13 miles. Oh, I almost forgot. Chrissy did more trail magic today, before she left. She gave Soda Pop and Skittles a ride back to the trail head. Then she came back and brought Conductor and myself to our trail head. She is a great Trail Angel ! Shout out to two nephews: Joe and his wife Sydney... Any day now... A baby girl. And congrats to Brad and Courtney... #4 on the way. Thanks to all who have sent me messages regarding some possible trail magic as I continue to move North. I look forward to meeting you guys along the way.","861.3

Conductor and I got a late start (11:30) because our shuttle guy did not show so we had to secure a back up ride to our starting location. Oh well... As Woodchuck said... Patience! The hike itself we pretty calm. We passed Loft Mountain campground and I was able to purchase a coke and some cookies as a late afternoon snack. My foot feels fine. I did add tape to the top and pulled it up to my shins. I'll keep that on... And hopefully the issue is resolved. We were trying to find a good stealth camp sight about a mile north of pine field hut but there was nothing around. When I came to the gap I saw a ranger pulling out of an area that has a ranger station. I flagged him down and asked if we could camp On their grounds next to the office. He said ok and if anyone ( in the morning) questioned us.. He told me to say, ""ranger Matt said it was ok to camp here"". Thanks Ranger Matt!! A father and daughter, Scott and Catherine joined us. They are out for a 5 day hike. She just graduated from VA Tech and she wanted to hike with her dad as a graduation present. SWEET!!Conductor also keeps a trail journal so you guys can follow him as well. He is shooting for Front Royal, VA on Saturday afternoon. His wife will come on Sunday and stay a week. She will help him slack pack and do other logistics for him. We will probably hike for a few days together. Well, we don't hike together. Our pace is different. But we will aim for the same stopping points each day for about a week. It is Wednesday morning...5:30. I am getting ready for the day. Looking at a 17 mile day. I slept really well... On a nice piece of grass by the ranger station. A big bonus... There is a faucet on the outside of the building that I can get my water. And there is a trash dumpster ... Yippie... I can throw my trash and not carry it! Ahhh... Again.. Simple things!! I have had my breakfast. Protein bar dipped in peanut butter, a few bites of cheese. I have packed my morning and lunch snacks: pop tarts, spam, meal replacement bar and peanut butter. Ok. I will hike today. Oh... Foot still feels good.","881.3

Yep-- I am over 900 miles!!I passed high top hut and baldface mountain. The weather for the last two days had been beautiful. They are calling for rain tomorrow. Today I was up and hiking at 6:45. I made it to the campground at around 3. I took a coin operated shower ... $1 for 5 minutes. Outstanding !! Then I washed clothes... Yippie. All in the camp store. I also had a pocket pizza. A honey bun. A bag of chips. And now a beer. My tent is set up... Conductor is also here and he too is munching down . My hike today was uneventful but I did have some very nice views of the mountains. I struggled big time in deciding to stop at the campground. I still had some daylight left and gave a lot of consideration to walking 9 more miles. But, listening to my head and NOT my stubborn side... And talking to Chrissy... I decided 17.8 miles was good enough. I think if I had continued I would have regretted trying to put in too many miles. Anyway... I am now set for the day. I hope to rest well. I do have a big mileage day set for tomorrow ... Just trying to set myself up for Front Royal arrival on Saturday or Sunday. I met Hong Kong Eddie and Steve on the trail. Steve is a thru hiker and Eddie is here for 2 weeks. I cannot even imagine being in a foreign country ...attempting to do this hike. Not that the trail is any different. But everything involved...especially Language. Both of them are so gracious ... I have enjoyed chatting with them. My foot felt good today. I hope that continues. I have thought a lot lately about what my journey is about. Those thought change from one minute to the next. Sometimes I am thinking... Ok, I've walked enough.. I think I'll call Chrissy to come get me. Then I can see myself continuing to walk... Because I am not ready to stop. I see myself reaching Harper's Ferry... And reevaluating what I am doing. Bottom line... It changes (my thoughts) all the time. And, I know I am not alone in my thoughts. What I do know is... My heart wants to reach Maine but I also know that regardless of where my journey ends... It is all good. Today my nephew, Joe and his wife Sydney welcomed their baby girl, Tatum to the world today.

Tooooooo many miles but when Dr. perky said he was going to a hostel in Luray...my mind flashed to: clean clothes, a shower and possibly a Mexican restaurant... My ""wants"" over ruled my mind and the fact that that is too many miles for me. But.. Here I am ... Showered, clothes in the wash and I have already eating a good Mexican meal and it is only 7:30!But man do my feet hurt!!!This is how my day went: up at 5 .. Tent down, breakfast, lunch packed, water bottles filled and walking by 6:01 .   I knew I had about 8 miles to walk before coming upon Big Meadows Campground . I knew they had a store and I decided...I'm having a cup of coffee!! I got there around 9:30 only to discover the store was 1 Mile off the trail. Not a big deal if you have a car but by foot... That means 2 miles round trip. NOT HAPPENING! But, as I walked by the camp sight I asked a couple if they had an extra cup of coffee... Answer : No but we will be happy to take you to the store !! I was in the car with Millie, their dog , in 30 seconds!! Got my cup of coffee and was walking again.. All within 30 minutes. I ran into Dr. Perky when I was 13 miles into my hike. I have know him for about 3 weeks and we see each other on and off. He told me about the hostel in Luray... And that was it... I was going to do 26.1 so I could shower and wash clothes. But back to the hike. At 1 we crossed the skyline drive and saw Skyland restaurant. We walked in... Not smelling or looking like the best customers but... We had money !!! We bought cold drinks, salads, sweets and more cold drinks. As the temps are changing I find I can't drink enough. After the treats it was time to cover miles ... Dr Perky stopped dead in his hike and said... Did u see that? What?? That bob cat!! Are you kidding. I did not see anything! He asked... How many bears have you seen? Me, none. How about you? I've seen 8!!! What... Heck all I have seen are deer and squirrel ... And I see those at home all the time. Oh well, maybe I'll see something exciting later. We completed our hike at 5:15 and the hostel owner, Allyson was waiting for us at the trail head. A short 10 minute ride and we had arrived. After a shower and picking out my loaner clothes (see pics) we were off to get dinner at the Mexican restaurant. I'm very tired and don't think I'll start hiking until 9 or 10 tomorrow.

I was the first one up so I made a pot of coffee and cooked myself some pancakes .. I even did the dishes!! I have not washed dishes in 2 months. It actually made me feel a bit normal-- I was smiling washing dishes!!My shuttle ride brought me back to the trail head at 9:30. Later then I wanted... But it was all good. My goal was to cover 9 miles and stop at Elkwallow Wayside (store in the SNP). I got there around 12:15 and promptly had: a blueberry milk shake, grilled cheese sandwich and fries. Then I was off heading north at 1. It briefly rained but nothing serious. I was walking along and noticed hundreds of little grasshoppers all over the trail. So I stopped to try to take a pic. I was not having any success so I was putting my phone away and I looked to my right. Not one but TWO bears (larger Cubs) were watching me! One was standing on his hind legs and the other seemed to be hiding in the tall grass. I said aloud /-- finally-- I get to see a bear on my hike. When they realized I was looking at them... The one standing took off running and the other attempted to climb a tree... And promptly fell. Seeing them was a special treat for me. Shortly after that I saw a fox!! I thought WOW.. Today is my day to see the animals!! Thirty minutes later..... I was looking at what I thought was a down tree with part of it black from fire. I was literally 4 feet from it when I realized it was another bear!! Just sitting there but looking in the opposite direction of me. When it turned and realized I was there it took off running. Very very cool!!! Three bears in 1 hour.   I also saw one of the largest wild turkeys I have ever seen. I was not sure how far I wanted to walk today but as I continued on my trek... I could see the clouds rolling in and then I began to hear the thunder. Not that I can't camp in the rain.... It just sucks!! So, my mind shifted to... How far is the next hostel ? And that is how and why I walked further then I really expected today. Oh well, I am here now (Front Royal Hostel) .. Showered, clothes washed and a bunk. I even had a small pizza and ice cream . Bunk, towel, load of laundry , small pizza = $30!! What a deal. I met a hiker yesterday who told me his name was : IFLH. I could not figure it out... And asked what it stood for. You guys guess... I'll give you the answer tomorrow. The clue is... When he told me what it stood for... I called him a lier.I have been asked if I am having fun. That's a tough question. I like challenges... So that part of it... I like. But no kidding.. This is kicking my ass. I do think I tend to do too many miles but I plan on changing that. I am also taking a zero or two ... Sunday and possibly Monday. I am blessed that Chrissy is able to come see me again this weekend. I am looking forward to seeing her and NOT walking for a day or two. Back to the ""fun"" question. This hike is a bit like a job... Logistics, get up every day.. Walk, cover miles, set up camp... Sleep... Break down camp.. Eat... Walk.. Etc, etc, etc.. The things I like-- meeting different people, hearing their stories, seeing the views, doing something that not everyone has the opportunity to do, sharing my day (through the journal), looking forward to special stops/-- usually connected to FOOD.   I have received a few emails from hikers who I met but have since gone home. I spoke of Farrell in a previous journal entry. Turns out he has injured his back... And will need to have medical treatment. Another one, Jul injured her knee and will have an MRI next week. Rich actually got hurt in a hotel.. When he fell in the shower !!Back to the hostel... I decided I wanted some ice cream so I asked the owner, Mike, where I could find a bowl to scoop some ice cream into. He said... Do you have a spoon. Yes I do... Mike said.. Just use your spoon and eat it out of the gallon container. But I don't want the entire gallon. That's ok... Just eat what you want. Hummmm. Ok. There are 8 people in the bunk house... 5 guys and 3 gals. I'm glad I have ear plus because I know there will be snoring tonight. Ok... Good night.","mile 941.2

I passed the Jim and Molly Shelter which has a porch, chairs, solar shower. Pretty cool for a shelter. I know I complained when it was cold and raining... well, now it is crazy crazy hot and humid. Oh well.... just like life... in general.. there always seems to be something that we wish we could change. But that is NOT happening out here.. I just need to get over it and keep moving North. Last night at the hostel I though for sure there would be snoring but you know what... I was WRONG. It was actually pretty quite for a bunk room with 8 people in it. I met a few new hikers... Sponge Bob, from Hawaii. He and I chatted a bit this morning and we both expressed the desire to have more time during the day to really enjoy nature.... but we both feel like.... we need to WALK to get our miles done for the day. I think both of us will try hard to correct that and take a little more time to really enjoy everything around us. The hike was nothing special today other then....at the end I knew Chrissy and Sammi would be there. I arrived before she did so I made a few phone calls and then saw her pulling into the parking lot. I told Chrissy...I am one spoiled hiker!! This is two weekends in a row that I have seen her. I don't take that lightly!! There are some folks out here that will not see their loved ones until they go home  That would be so very hard. Anyway, we are now in Front Royal, Va for two night. I am taking a ZERO tomorrow. I am really looking forward to NOT walking for the day. Also, Trotter will be in the area tomorrow night and I am hoping we can have dinner together. She sent me a text that said, ""I am so dirty...and I can't believe ...I don't even care, any more!"" Too funny! After checking into the Super 8 motel Chrissy and i headed to dinner at a local Asian restaurant. The appetizers were very good but both of our entrees were not that good. So....what would any good hiker do??? Hmmmmm... after we ate what we could, paid our bill..... I then drove straight to the hamburger joint and order another meal! Yep...ate that as well. The good news is - - -the hamburger joint is across the street from the motel. And they also sell ice cream. All that makes me very happy. It is hard to believe that I am close to the 1000 mile mark. To look back on the journey thus far I can't even wrap my arms around the fact that I have been walking for 65 days. I have met so many people, heard so many interesting stories, learned so many things, push myself harder then I ever have, cried because I missed Chrissy and Sammi, fell flat on my face and now have a permanent scar on my nose, eaten more food then I ever thought I could (and some very strange combinations), heard from folks (through trail journals) that I have not seen since high school, and from new friends that just happened upon my journal.... that is just a few of the things I think back on when I start to reflect a bit. OK.... nothing else for now... Just so happy to have my feet up as I have put in a lot of miles over the past two weeks. OHHHHH...

I am currently at mile marker 985.5, I did 8 miles today.   I was going to take a zero day but when Chrissy said she was going to the trail to hike with Sammi while I rested....I could not stand the thought of not joining them. Soooooo....I decided to do a NERO day. (nero is anything 10 miles and under). Chrissy brought me to a drop off point and then she drove south and walked towards me where we met halfway and then hiked in together. The weather was cool so it made for a very pleasant day. And, knowing I was doing a total of 8 miles put my mind at ease. As we came down the mountain and over the last footbridge I was trying to make sure Sammi did not walk towards the lady I saw standing on the side. I wanted Sammi to get into the creek to wash off the mud she had gathered on the trail. Little did I realize that the ""lady"" standing on the side was, I Believe !!! And, her husband, Mr. Jimmy was in a hammock relaxing. Chrissy crossed the bridge after me and she said, ""Amy, look who it is!"" I turned and it was then that I realized it was, I Believe and Mr. Jimmy.   It put the biggest smile on my face. They made a special stop on their way back home to see me at the trail head. They knew I was on the trail as I had answered a text that Mr. Jimmy sent me earlier in the day. Little did I know he was doing that...to figure out where I was so they could come see me. Wow... how special is that!!! We sat and chatted for about an hour and then they had to hit the road. ""I Believe"" gave me some very good advice regarding the remainder of my hike. THANKS - I Believe.... and Mr. Jimmy for making and taking the time to come see me. Chrissy and I then went back to the Super 8 Motel. After we cleaned up the front desk called and asked if I could take a call. Me??? What??? Sure!!! I heard a very familiar voice on the other end.... my friend, SUZANNA H. had driven from Fredericksburg, Va to see me. WHAT.... !!! She said.... ""honey, I am coming up...what room are you in?"" Too funny.   I open the door and who is coming down the hallway...my good friend, Suzanna. WOW... what a great day!!! She drove 1.5 hours just to say hello.

I am #414 for this year. I was up at 5 and walking by 6 this morning. My plans changed a bit as my friend, Keri was going to meet me at the hostel and let me slack pack but I decided to skip that and just walk towards her at Harpers Ferry. I made this decision because .... knowing me... I would be up and ready to go and I did not want to have other logistics to deal with. So, I was the first one out the door (Bears Den Hostel) to start my walk. I had a few more miles of the roller coaster section of the trail before things became a bit easier.

I made it to the AT Conservatory ...took my picture, had two cold drinks and then I had another special visitor.   A good friend and former colleague, TL W. walked in the door!! So good to see her! She drove from the DC area just to visit and have lunch. We went to a local pizza place...yes, PIZZA... but it was much better pizza then Red Barron...that I have been eating since Georgia!! WE also went to the local outfitter because I needed another shirt. NO I am not getting rid of the shirt that I started the hike with...so all of my pictures will still be the yellow one that says Run Seattle. More people ask...are you from Seattle - - because of my shirt. That answer is obviously, ""no"" but it usually ends up being a great opening for conversations. Anyway.. back to my visitors (Keri and TL) I had TL come into the hostel, where both Keri and I are staying tonight. It is called, Tea Horse Hostel in Harpers Ferry. I showed her the bunk room...how things are done...etc...and told her she could spend the night. Her response, ""oh, hell no, I am not sleeping here when my own bed is only 1 hour from here."" LOL... OK...wait one more surprise... I am sitting her writing my journal on the hostel computer and I hear the door open behind me. I glance and OMG...it is another good friend and former colleague, Dennis L... OMG...what a special treat. I can't believe....two friends who drove to see me. WOW... I can't believe it. I am so so so blessed. I will include several pictures in the photo journal. OK... I might update this journal some more tonight but now I want to visit with my friends. 
The 4 of us, Keri, Dennis, TL and myself went out to eat even though we had just had lunch 2.5 hours earlier. I should say.... Only Dennis and I ate. It was so great seeing everyone... Thanks guys... All of you rock! TL thanks for the last lunch treat and Dennis thanks for the dinner treat.

I love the fact that my hike has turned into such a community effort. Not every hiker would want the help and some might even think that it is not the same as doing it ""all alone"" in every aspect. I, on the other hand, look at it this way: if anyone wants to be involved in my hike...in any aspect... I welcome it. I want to share this experience. Yes, this is my hike and as the t-shirt says: ""hike your own hike."" I could not agree more. I have had friends visit, I have had strangers help me, I have received notes (on my journal) from people who want to help me as I get further north, there is a couple in PA (Cunninghams) who have offered to feed me and take me to their home...

She did her marathon training run in Shippensburg, PA and then she joined Spongebob and myself for the last 6 miles of our hike. A few things:To Flossy: FYI. Hikers don't shake hands.. Due to germs. We do fist bumps instead. I know that will make you happy. To Lisa F.: You better get your hiking boots ready!!To Fran: I shared your Spam with Spongebob... As he is from Hawaii as well but had never tasted the spam bites. He liked them!!To all my nieces and nephews... Thanks so much for following along. I love each and every one of you. My knee/-- it felt fine today. I added the KT tape for support. To everyone... Yes I may have lost some weight but not much. I still feel strong so I am not worried about it. I saw the perfect camping shelter today (see pics). It was actually two shelters that slept 6 in each but one had a sign : snoring and the other had a non snoring sign on it. What a great idea. Tomorrow the area I am in is slated to get a lot of rain. Spongebob and I decided to hike in it... Unless they predict something severe.","mile marker 1064.1

Sharing the moment with Spongebob!   And we covered our miles BEFORE it rained!!Keri was there to join us for the last 3 miles of our hike. Our stopping location was where the ""half gallon ice cream challenge "" takes place. Thru hikers pay $10 to take part in the challenge. If you can eat the ice cream in one hour you are then awarded a wooden spoon ! Neither Spongebob or myself took part in the challenge. Oh... We also saw a rare snake today...smooth greensnake (official name). (See pics). That was a treat. We are now at the local laundromat... Washing clothes for the first time in 4 days. Yes, I have been the same clothes... And YES I stink!!! The good news is... So does everyone else ??. Thanks to all for continuing to follow along. Special thanks to Keri for all of her support.

I covered 23.4 miles today. Today Spongebob and I had a very nice hike. The terrain was gentle and we also walked through a lot of farm land. Some of the hikers are not fond of this type of hiking but I really enjoy seeing the crops and walking near the farm homes. We made it to Boiling Springs around 2. After getting a smoothie and purchasing new inserts for my shoes we hiked out of Boiling Springs. We wanted to do 4 extra miles today since tomorrow we will try to make it to Duncannon, PA. It will be 21.4 mile hike tomorrow. And.... We have been warned!!!! The ""bad section "" of PA starts a few mile before Duncannon! The ROCKS are coming. It has been described as the never ending sea of rocks with no views of dirt! Meaning lots of careful walking, slow, and lots of stress on knees. Oh my!! Not looking forward to that. Oh well... You have to take the good with the bad! Right??Thanks for all of you who are reading and cheering me on. Much appreciated. It does help... Reading the journal entries. 
I have enjoyed hiking with Spongebob and we will continue to hike together tomorrow. But just like a good book.... There is always another chapter. Soon he will have family joining him... So his hiking will change (re: miles). The good news is he will always be a good friend and that is super special. Thanks Spongebob!Keri will go home tomorrow. We have really enjoyed her company and assistance. Shout out to The Cunninghams who offered to pic me up and let me stay at their home. Very nice!! Due to the number of people in my ""party"" it worked best for us to make arrangements at a local hostel. But... The offer was very nice!!Ohhhh... I almost forgot ... We had trail magic today. (See pics). There was pizza and beer!! Yes I had both. This is going to sound strange... Except for those who know me well... But I am so tired of eating!! It seem like other then hiking...

This morning Keri brought Spongebob and myself to a local cafe before we left Boiling Springs. We said our goodbyes and thanked Keri for her company and help over the past few days. She rocks!!We started hiking at 7:30 and the first 13 miles were so nice. We passed through more farm land and open fields. Spongebob and I decided we like this type of hiking so much because we are both... Country folks! He is actually from PA! I was loving PA until noonish!!! And then the beginning of the rocks started. Yikes! And, as I am told, the beginning is actually pretty calm compared to the next 160 miles. The weather was also a bit odd... Lots of wind and then .... Boom... It started raining!! We were at the top of the mountain and needed to descend to our stopping location. That was quite tricky. And ... Dang it, heck, darn, son of a gun... My knee started acting up again. Hurting with each step. I made it down ... Only to realize that Spongebob, who was ahead of me, was not off the mountain. I called and he indicated that he and another hiker had missed the trail and were trying to find the correct trail. So, I gave him some tips on where the trail turned and told him I would meet him in town. I made it to the famous Doyle Hotel ... Really.. The not so famous!! It is an extremely old hotel. Run down to the max!! You get a room for $25. I'll just put it this way:: there is a sheet hanging in my window ( window covering) no AC, the carpet has not been vacuumed in about a year, the bath is down the hall and it is quite scary... Like really scary. But!!!!! It has a bed, running water and it will make for great stories later on. Here is another beautiful story that is currently unfolding. When I lived in Houston I had a wonderful neighbor, Randy W. About 14 years ago he and his partner moved to Mount Joy, PA where they bought and currently run a very very nice bed and breakfast!! Ok... Now guess how far I am from there??? I am only 30 minutes (via car) from there. So, tomorrow Spongebob and I will take a Nero day (anything less then 10 miles). We will walk 2 miles to a parking lot where Randy will pick us up... Take us to his B and B where we will spend the night. He will then return us to the trail on Thursday !!! I have not seen Randy or Jon in about 13 years so I am very excited to visit and catch up with them. How special is that little story. ??Ok back to the Doyle. So there is a restaurant/bar on the first floor and that is where u check in. I asked the bartender about a room and she said ( without cracking a smile) oh, you want the hotel clerk?? Yes, I guess so. Ok, wait a second. She was wearing a cap .. Backwards when I was talking to her.... So after my request for a room and our exchange.. She took off her cap and placed it on her head.. The correct way and said... Ok honey, how many rooms do you need. Too funny. When her cap is on... Backwards she is the bartender.. When on correctly she is the hotel clerk.Even though the rooms are quite interesting and the place is run down.....They serve wonderful meals. I had fried catfish, French fries and a salad ($17)! Then Spongebob and I walked to the local ice cream shop and had some soft serve !! Tomorrow I'll see how my knee feels and make a decision as to hiking on Thursday. I'm going to buy a brace and see if that helps. Fingers crossed!!Even with the knee issue... I had a good day and I feel very blessed. I'm one lucky girl (old lady)!","mile marker 1125.1

We covered 1.7 miles and currently at mile marker, 1148.4.After a pretty poor night of sleep at the Doyle Hotel, Spongebob and I walked across the street for breakfast. We ate with , My Friend (another hiker), who I meet several weeks ago. We then packed our backpacks and headed out on our very short 1.7 mile walk to a parking lot near the Susquehanna River. This is where we would wait for our trail angel and my dear friend, Randy W! He and John own a B &B in Mount Joy, Pa. He picked us up at 8:45 and drove us to their wonderful B&B (Cameron Inn &Estate). Wow!!! What a treat. We arrived at 9:30...we were served some wonderful coffee, cheese, cracker and grape plate. Yummmm. We then cleaned up and promptly left with Randy and John to see a bit of Lancaster County and lunch in Lititz, PA. We shared 4 different sandwiches...all excellent. After that we had the most delicious ice cream that I have had since being on the trail. After seeing more sights we returned to the B&B for an afternoon nap. I did mention that today is a NERO day (very little walking and a bit of rest day). Oh, I also picked up a knee brace in hopes of that helping my issues. Tomorrow when we hit the trail we will have roughly 145 miles of rocks before we exit PA into NJ. This will be a good test for my knee. After resting a bit I realized I probably needed more food for the next few days of hiking. So, John took me to the grocery for a few more high calorie items   For dinner, Tyler, the chef at the B&B cooked a wonderful meal for the 4 of us. John also prepared some very tasty drinks and fresh salads for us. OMG... I want to stay here!!! Being treated like this and enjoying such wonderful company and conversations with old friends has been so special. Randy and John... Words cannot express how nice it was of you to accept not only me but my new friend Spongebob into your home and treat us with such love. It actually brings a tear to my heart. A good tear... One that makes me realize how lucky I am. You guys are truly Trail Angels! Thank you , thank you, thank you!!!On the motivational aspect of my journey: I find I am struggling a bit more lately. I love certain aspects of this adventure but I don't care for a lot of the day to day, routine, do it again... Logistics... Part of it.

It is a small room with 2 bunks and one single. So max is 5 people. I love that! The stay also comes with dinner and breakfast. All for $35. That's a great deal. I'll put some pictures in the photo section when I have wifi. Last night I slept well in the shelter but I was glad I had ear plugs. A weekend hiker , who was sleeping on the second floor of the shelter, was a serious snorer. Spongebob and I were both up early and began walking at 6. It was a very good feeling to know we only had 13.4 to cover for the day. We got to the trail head at noon and we were at the hostel by 12:15. Showered in the outside shower, went into town to pick up more spam, ate a hamburger and now relaxing. So far PA has been an ok State ... I have had a lot of rocks but I have also been warned that the next 100 miles are really bad. Yikes. Oh well, one day at a time... In every aspect of this hike. My mind was better today and I look forward to hiking tomorrow. Someone asked... Why do I say: hiking or walking... And not always use the term hiking. The answer is : who the heck knows.. I don't... I just use both as they are the same. Oh guess what.... The lady who runs the hostel also cuts hair!!! So, I'm going to get a haircut today!! $10. Sweet. Did I say I was staying here for a week. I should!!! Such a wonderful little place. But I'll move on. Except, Spongebob and I are talking about slack packing tomorrow so we can come back and spend tomorrow night here as well.

We were slack packing. There is no other way to say this.... But, the AT in this section of PA is horrible. The rocks are unbelievable and my feet are killing me. The good news is... Since we did big miles we are taking a zero tomorrow. Just to let our feet recover. I can't say enough about the hostel... Rock N Sole!! It is by far my favorite. And the owners are such awesome people. Funny story... So, yesterday, Jodie cut my hair and about an hour later we were standing outside chatting and she said.... Hummmm I think we should add a little more spike to your hair. So, she cut my hair .... Twice in two hours. Then she suggested that I put a while blaze in my hair. For those of you who don't know... The AT markers are white blazes on trees. Of course the hiker crowd would understand what the blaze in my hair meant but I think the non hiker crowd would think my hair resembled the skunk look. So, I passed on the white blaze... Even though Keri R called me a party pooper for not doing it!! Another story: Thru Hiker, Soup is carrying a Toyota hub cap on his pack. The story goes like this: the hub cap was found last year by a PCT thru hiker who carried it all the way to Canada... Then he somehow got the hubcap, which has a name.. TOTO ... To the beginning of the AT this year and hikers have been carrying it ... Hopefully all the way to Maine. I have pictures... And again, I'll upload pics when I have wifi...so, it might be a few days.

This section of PA is no fun at all. The boulders, rocks and oh yea I saw a rattle snake today. Two feet from me!! So needless to say... I want out of PA. I think I can cover the last 40.2 miles in two days so hopefully by Thursday evening I'll be in NJ. I never thought I would say... I want to be in NJ (sorry Chrissy). Ok about today. Spongebob, Anna and I had a great breakfast at the hostel and then Craig drove us to the trail head. The weather was perfect. The trail... And I am not exaggerating.. Is one of the worse hiking trails I have ever hiked. It is solid rocks, uneven, boulders, pointed rocks... If I don't twist an ankle I'll be lucky. As we were climbing a boulder field I stopped to look back for Anna and Spongebob when I heard something. For a brief second I did not know what it was and then my little pea brain registered that it was a rattle snake. I froze and look down only to see the snake right below me on the next Boulder. After a few curse words I was moving across the rocks. And guess what SB and Anna were doing.... They thought the snake was so cool, pretty and... Are you kidding me!!! I tried to take a pic but then I told them... Ok, I'm out of here ... I'll wait for you up the trail. Let's just say I am not a fan of snakes. The rest of the hike was the same.. Rocks and boulders... Even to the point on sliding down on my butt because it was so much of a rock scramble. With a pack of 30 lbs on your back... It makes this section quite challenging. Now we are set up for camping... I'm in my tent, Anna is in her hammock, Spongebob is sleeping on top of a tarp in a sleeping bag. I have called Peggy...

I am very careful about checking for ticks but sometimes you just don't catch it so enough. I had an interesting supper tonight.. My sandwich was:: a big slice is spam, 4 slices of summer sausage, peanut butter, powered cheese, mustard and honey. Oh my .. I can't believe I ate that!! But I did.

We told Anna, who is 21, to stand out front, I stood second (and I could pass for her mother) and we told Spongebob to go hide in the woods . Well the first truck that passed... Stopped and gave us a ride. It took 15 seconds to catch that ride. We made it to the restaurant.. Ate well and we asked a guy who worked there for a ride back to the trail head.

The weather was misty all day which made for nice hiking weather. We also came across trail magic at one road crossing. It was an ice chest with cold cokes in it. Nice!! We arrived in Delaware Water Gap, PA around 3:30. We went to the outdoor store where Spongebob was interviewed by a local TV crew regarding his AT hike. We then went to a local pub for some food and a few drinks. Then to have ice cream and coffee before we walked across the bridge to NJ. My friend, of 36 years, Peggy R. was coming to pick me up, from Scranton, PA, so I could spend two nights with her. Meaning a zero on Friday.

She gathered me from the trail yesterday and will bring me back tomorrow morning. It has been great seeing all of her family and catching up on things. I told her I walked all the way from Georgia just to see her    And actually ...she would be worth the walk. We are great friends.Tomorrow I'll be ready to hit the trail. Meeting Spongebob and his niece Gecko at the trail head in NJ at 9 a.m. NJ has 78 miles of the AT then it is on to NY.Funny story: Peggy's neighbor came over to visit and she looked at my (bare) feet and could not get over how swollen they looked. She keep asking me if I wanted to go to her house to soak them in her jacuzzi tub. Just to put her mind at ease I put ice packs on both of my feet while she was visiting. They are quite swollen but I would only expect that with all the walking I am doing. Good night.... I'll hike tomorrow.","mile 1293.3 PA/NJ border

Peggy brought me back to the trail head at 8:45 a.m. Spongebob and Gecko met me there and we began hiking at 8:50. The trail still has quite a bit of rocks but nothing like PA. We walking our first 10 miles and then walked an extra .3 to get lunch at an outdoor center. While there I met a hiker, Sweet Potato, who I have never seen before. That is starting to happen more and more. Seeing and meeting new hikers. Fun. After our lunch break we heading out and came upon an old fire tower. Catfish tower. I climbed up to the top so I would have a 360 view of NJ. I could see a few lakes but nothing in the line of mountains... And I'm ok with that!!We came to a good campsite around 5:30 that also had a water source. So we decided to stay. We were the first 3 here and now there are 8 (total). Zack is camping next to me and I just pray he does not snore. I have slept near him in the past .... And OMG he snores like crazy. Yikes!!!I am having an issue with one of my toes... About 1.5 months ago I had a stabbing pain in the top of my foot. I literally... Walked through the pain and it eventually went away but I continued to have more swelling in that foot then the other. Well I was describing this to Spongebob (who is a doctor) and I told him that my index toe does not come up when I try to flex my foot. He said... I have ""drop toe""   And it is because I have damaged or torn a tendon in my foot. Oh well.... As long as it does not cause any serious pains... I'll just have one crazy toe.... Out of 10...that's not too bad. Good night..... I'll be hiking tomorrow.","mile 1293.3 PA/NJ border

I am currently at mile marker 1335.7, high Point State Park (NJ). I covered 20.5 miles today. It is getting quite hot and humid. I totally felt the drain at the end of the hike today. The campsite last night was a good one but for some reason I did not sleep that well. We were up and walking by 6 a.m. It is important to get out early due to the heat. And, we wanted to finish in the early afternoon as SpongeBob's brother in law was picking he and Gecko up for the night. I am at a hotel and will meet them tomorrow at the trail head. Hiking with the two of them (SpongeBob and Gecko) is about to change. I will hike one more day with them and then they will go further north and walk Connecticut before NY. The reason for this is: SpongeBob's wife will join him soon and they will walk together for a bit. And then he has friends coming, from Hawaii, to join him and they want to walk the NY section. Bottom line is - - we all hike our own hike and his will take a logistical turn from here on out. He has invited me to ""do the same"" but my brain is already too full of logistical issues and concerns. I just need to keep walking North!!The hike today was uneventful but I want to advise those who are planning on doing the AT. NJ still has ROCKS. Nothing compared to PA but don't think they will magically disappear when you get to NJ. Not much else to share today. My feet are very sore but again....I would expect nothing less. Tomorrow I hope to make it to Vernon, NJ. I miss Chrissy.....and Sammi.","1315.2 csmpsite

I am still in NJ but physically I am in Unionville, NY with my tent set up behind the village office.   Free for thru hikers. There is a pizza joint across the street and a pub about .4 down the road. And a grocery that opens st 6 am for coffee.   Today I had a true Forest Gump moment. I had all intentions of walking 20 miles but when I hit Unionville.... I stopped and decided I was done. Not just for the day but... Ready to go home. So I hitched a ride into town. Which is a story in itself. A guy , going the opposite direction turned around... And when I looked in his car I thought... Ok something is wrong with this picture.. Car full of junk, front seat full of broken glass... But then I looked at him and thought... Hummm... I think I could take this guy if things go south... And I really need a ride... So I got in... And he brought me to the tavern. Where I had two beers and a burger. I then walked up the street and saw, Little Kiss and Snake.. Sitting on the front porch of the general store drinking sodas. So I joined them. They said it was to hot to keep hiking so they too were camping behind the village office. Both are great guys... In my age group . Spongebob and Gecko decided to take today and tomorrow as zero days. So, even though we were going to hike together today... We have now gone on our own journey. Trotter... Is home in Missouri. Poor thing became very ill and is now trying to recover from illness. She had an awesome hike and I really enjoyed meeting and befriending her. She may return after she recovers ... Whatever she decides.. It is her hike, her journey .... She walked more then a lot do in a lifetime. You rock Trotter. As for my journey. I know it is up to me to decide. I am a bit tired of all the logistics, repeat of days...walk and walk some more. My head is my worse enemy. I think.. A lot about something my friend Randy W asked me.... Have I received, from the trail, what I was looking for? I still don't know that answer. Mainly because I am not sure if I am looking for anything... Other then an adventure. So I question myself... Have I had enough of this adventure?   Oh, the Forest Gump moment... Remember in the movie when he just stopped running... Because he was tired and ready to go home. That is how I felt today around noon when I decided to stop in Unionville. I have and will continue to share all of my true feelings through this journal. I am not looking for a cheering squad to say... You can do it... Keep going. While I appreciate the well wishes... This is something I will need to decide. I do know this... I will have another meal at the pup later today. I'll drink lots of gatoraid...it is super hot in NJ... And I will walk 10 more miles tomorrow with Snake and Little Kiss to the hostel in Vernon, NJ. Oh... I will also enjoy the full moon tonight. And, tomorrow is , ""hike naked day"" (not kidding). No, I will not partake in that tradition and I really don't want to see anyone who does. But at the same time I am curious as to... Does anyone really do that???","Mile marker 1335.7 (High Point State Park)

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539043,"Today is day 89, Tuesday. I am currently in Vernon, NJ at mile marker 1356.3. I did 10.7 miles today. Yes, still hiking and literally taking it one day at a time. That is all my little mind can handle right now. I do know I will hike tomorrow.... and that is all I know at this point. I do appreciate all the e-mails and calls regarding my hike. I know this is my decision and I hate being in such a flux ...not knowing what the hell I am doing (staying or going). And for those of you who know me.... I am usually quick to make decisions and then ""go with it""... so, maybe this is one of my lessons on the trail. Sometimes decisions are TOUGH and there is such a push pull in what to do. I know...I'll know when it is time. Yesterday...it was time - - at that moment. But, then when I ran across Little Kiss and Snake...they lifted my spirits and invited me to walk with them the next few days. So, I decided to accept that invitation and get it a go. Trust me I am not the only hiker out here trying to figure out what the right decision is. We are at a point that....we are all very tired, the heat is upon us, the logistics get VERY OLD, eating spam, etc...all gets very old. With all that being said: Today's hike was a nice one. Short and full of NJ board walks. Just two climbs that were not very hard. I understand that NY (which I will be in tomorrow) has some hand over fist climbing... So, the easy board walks today felt good. Today was hike naked day. Snake decided to take part in that tradition. He is too funny. He informed me that he was the first kid in his high school that streaked ....so I guess it was all very familiar to him. It definitely made me laugh. We made it to the Chruch Hostel at noon. We had to hitchhike into town. The 3 of us were picked up by a local lady who said she like to, ""help out the hikers."" We are in the basement of a church that has a washer and dryer, shower and floor space. The donation is $10. The grocery store is a 5 minute walk away. I have my sleeping bag set out on the floor...claiming my space for the night. We have a taxi coming at 7 a.m. for a ride back to the trailhead tomorrow. We plan on a 17 mile day. Might be a bit much due to the climbs but that is where the first shelter is located. Thanks again for those of you following along. I will continue to walk until I fell as though I am ""done"" (thanks Chris C.). I would not look at it as quitting... I would simply be ""done"" with this journey. Wherever that is.... it will be just fine. I'm walking tomorrow.

After an OK night at the hostel ( just did not sleep well.. Everything else was great) I walked to Dunkin Donuts at 5 for coffee and bagels and donuts . I also ordered a sandwich to go so I could have that for lunch. Snake (S), Little Kiss (LK) and I left the hostel at 7 and we were walking by 7:15. It was a pleasant day with a nice breeze.   The highlight of the day was making it out of NJ and into NY. That makes 8 states are completed. The next big highlight was seeing... From Prospect Rock.. A very faint outline of NYC. Now let's talk about really big highlight... We walked an extra .2 mile to go to a creamery. I had an outstanding vanilla shake. I think she put at least 6 scoops of ice cream in it. I could barely finish it!! I had that and then we walked our last two miles to the shelter. So far just the 3 of us here. But, I know there will be more as there is a chance of rain. Someone asked me a good question::: why do I journal and maybe I might want to think about only updating every now and then. Here is my answer. For those of you who don't really know me... I am quite the private person. So doing the journal and sharing as much as I do.. Is NOT the norm for me. But, prior to doing this trail I followed several thru hikers (via their journals)   I learned so much from their honesty and willingness to share. So, I wanted to do the same... And give back to the hiking community... And to allow those who dont hike... A look into the life of someone on the trail. And I will always be honest with my emotions, feelings, struggles, challenges, etc... It is important for people who are thinking of doing the trail to see all sides of what to expect. I also keep the journal for myself... So I can look back at my journey. Shout out to Trotter... Hoping she is feeling better. Today I enjoyed hiking with S and LK... I just stay I the back and walk with them. I kept my mind blank... And just went with the flow. Nice. Ok ... Chores and supper... Then bed. One more hiker has arrived. A woman from Japan ...

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539428,"Today is day 91, Thursday. I am currently at mile marker 1393.0 (William Brien Memorial Shelter). Today I covered 19.6 miles. Last night my sleep in the shelter was not that good. I never could really settle my mind and the mosquitos were buzzing around my head all night. So, tonight even though we are at a shelter, I have opted to sleep in my tent. I usually sleep better in it anyway. Today we started hiking at 6 and did not finish until 5:40 pm. We had several rock scrambles and passed through the New York Lemon Squeezer. To pass through the Lemmon S most people have to take their pack off and carry it in front of them. Since I am built like a two by four (meaning no hips and no ass) I was able to keep my pack on... But I did have to lift my arms over my head to fit. We are having a very hard time finding water in NY. All of the creeks are dry. At several of our road crossing people have been very nice and placed gallons of water for the hikers. Without this trail magic we would be in trouble. We walked off trail to the Lake Tiorati beach because we could get water there and a free shower. So, at 3 we made it there.. I took a shower and put my stinky, wet, dirty clothes right back on after my shower. But guess what.... I still felt so much better after the shower. We all filled up with 3 liters of water and carried it 4 miles to our camp site. Adding that much water makes my pack feel like 40 lbs!! Especially at the end of the day. Yesterday I asked Cruise missle if she liked the hike so far. Her reply was, ""I love it."" It made me wonder because... I sure don't love it. A lot of the time I don't even like it. So, at lunch today I asked Snake and Little Kiss the same question. Both said... No, they don't love it. They like different aspects of it. But most of all they like the challenge. My thoughts are... I like some parts/// meeting people, trail Angels, seeing beautiful sights, hearing others stories... I don't like: being dirty all the time, eating what I have been eating, being away from home, my feet always hurting. Daily I think about what the trail has already taught me and I give thanks for that. I know this journey will end... Whenever... But I also realize that I will carry , with me, so many life lessons from being on this trail. Tomorrow we will pass through Bear mountain near Fort Montgomery, NY. We will pass through bear mountain zoo which is the lowest point on the AT (177 feet). We will cover 16.6 miles tomorrow and stay at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center. Tenting is free at their ball field and there are showers. Sweet.Tomorrow I'll hike. Heck if I don't... I'll still be in the woods. So, I have to hike!! But, I also want to hike . BTW.. I think it is pretty amazing how often I can post from the middle of the woods. I think I should get a contract with Verizon... Just to give them props for such good, far reaching service..

We were packed and walking at 6:05 a.m. We are still having issues with finding water. So, when we do find it... We end up drinking like a camel and then loading up our bottles (heavy).   We made it to the Bear Mountain Inn at 9:55. We asked about buying breakfast but he said... Sorry we just closed and won't serve anything until lunch. But then he said... You guys go up to the restaurant. We did and there was still stuff from the breakfast buffet. He said... Help yourself. Don't say that to 3 hungry hikers. We filled our plates and ate... Quite well. And!!!! They gave it to us.... Free of charge!! How sweet is that. From there we walked through the bear mountain zoo. Then across the Hudson River. We walked another 7 miles to a road crossing that had a good quick stop... Deli and all!! Here we bought sandwiches for our supper and food for the next 3 days. We ran into several other thru hikers doing the same thing. From there we walked one more mile to the Graymoor Center where we pitched our tents and took... Very cold showers. The shower is at the ball field. Just cold water. But it felt great. I took my shower with all my clothes on.. So I could wash them. Gosh do they stink!!!

We stopped around 2 at a state park.. Clarence Fahnestock. There we all downed extra fluids and took another cold shower and promptly put our stinky clothes back on. Oh well!!

The big issue continues to be the lack of water. It is a major concern We were actually only scheduled to do 16 miles today but since there was no water we kept walking so we could end up at the Deli. It was well worth the extra 3 miles.

And I was schooled on the history of superman ... All before 6 a.m. All 3 of us had breakfast, read the paper, dried our gear and packed our packs and then our trail angel, my niece, Jeanette, her two daughters arrived to shuttle us around. She brought us to Kent , CT so I could purchase shoes, then to the grocery, bank and ultimately back to our motel for the night. OMG... What a blessing she was. Oh and to boot... She cooked an awesome meal for all three of us. Can I tell you how good some Louisiana cooking taste !!! Think of your favorite thing... And that is what her meal was like !!!

We have had a change of plans. Tomorrow will not be a zero day. We will push on. And, we are actually 7 miles further north then I had recorded. That is even better. I had us at the wrong exit. Ok back to the hike... All is good. I have to admit that regardless of where this adventure is fulfilled and I am ready to go home... It has been such a rewarding time. Physically and mentally the toughest thing I have ever attempted.   People ask what is my favorite part... And by far it is the people I have met...mostly... Off the trail. The willingness to help total strangers just blows me away. And I love hearing their stories. It reminds me of watching the Sunday Morning Show that highlights ...good things (for the most part) in the US. Well, I could add to that show... All the wonderful people, with stories of their own, who want to help. Gosh.. What a special feeling that people who don't know you... Really care about you. I have included a picture of Wendy and her dog Lucy. She works at the motel... I sat with her for about an hour to hear her story. Lovely lady with nothing but good in her heart. And she shared how one of her jobs is to ride in horse trailers, with the million dollar horses, as they travel across the country. I would love that... So to hear her experience with that was a special treat to me. And her dog Lucy... When her owner passed away, Wendy took her in and gave her a loving home.

CT has been nice so far but we did have a very very steep decent.   Which can sometimes be harder then a climb. Every thing was wet from the rain last last. Snake feel a record 3 times today. All were pretty bad but he kept going. Little kiss fell once but not a bad one. I was the lucky one who stayed on my feet. Trust me... My turn will come. We are staying in the shelter tonight as it is calling for big rain tonight. Rather listen to people snoring then pack a wet tent in the morning. There are two flip flop hikers here, at the shelter, who just started their hike 2 days ago. It is interesting listening to their conversations. I had the same conversations when I was in Georgia. Now I feel like I was rather naive. But... We all learn as we go. And these two hikers will do the same. But of course we are sharing with them... Our knowledge..

Sleep was not that good but again I was very blessed to be dry! Even Lucky Dogs snoring was palatable . So we did our hike today...

I did speak to Ounce and Gram about yesterday's hike and they too said how slippery everything was. Ounce said she fell twice. We made it to Falls Village, CT where we are camping behind a local cafe (Toymakers Cafe). But, prior to our arrival we read there was an outdoor shower, for hikers use, at the local hydro plant. So, we walked there first and all three of us stripped down to our undies and took showers. All while the traffic drove by, the workers painted a wall... It was quite funny. At this point ... Anything goes. Tomorrow will be a short day. We will walk a little over 7 miles to Salisbury , CT where we will stay in a hostel. This stop is necessary as both Little Kiss and Snake will receive packages, from home. The place we are camping... It is quite funny. Hippie guy and gal .. Probably in their 60's. (Look at pics.. See their van parked in driveway ). Anyway, I spoke to them and they said... You must not leave until after breakfast tomorrow. We make the best sweet potato waffles. My response... Say no more -- I'm in!! Coffee, waffles and then a short hike. I wish every day was like that. She even said they get their batter from Louisiana. Ha.... Yet another sweet potato connection. As crazy as this sounds, I am looking forward to sleeping in my tent. It is my little home. I did walk to the package liquor store and met, Pat the owner. I told her I might be back later for a small bottle of wine. She said, ""oh honey, pick it out now and I'll get it cold for you."" Then she told me all about the village...

He is 68 years old and like me struggling with the mental aspect of this journey. He talked about going home but was concerned that he would let so many people down. Don't you find that interesting?? Here he has walked 1500 miles and he is worried about what others will think. Trust me... I totally understand where he is coming from. Sure, we are all out here, ""to hike our own hike"".... But, there is that unspoken pressure we (hikers) feel from those who are supporting us. I have eluded to this in previous journal entries. We also understand that it is simply encouragement , positive thoughts, well wishes, cheering us on.... But somehow we start to feel like ... Gosh, if I don't ""reach Maine"" it will not be a success. I know this is as far from the truth as possible!! So, as I sat with Lucky Dog and reassured him that he and everyone else walking the trail is successful - regardless of the how far we walk. It was at that time I could see the tears in his eyes and I think it was tears of.... Thanks, I needed to hear that. I stood up , gave him a big hug... At which point, my eyes were full as well. I told him that our loved ones at home wish the best for us but, only those who are walking or who have walked the trail totally understand all the emotions, challenges, etc that come with this adventure. Today, I bid him a good day... And started hiking. Low and behold he showed up at the same hostel. The first thing he said was, "" thanks so much for listening last night."" He needs to realize, by me listening, I too was reassured... That regardless of the distance... We will all be just fine. Then he said, "" I promise, I'm not sleeping in your room!""   I laughed out loud because.... Lucky Dog is, by far, the worse snorer in the trail, thus far!!! I have uploaded a few more pics in the photo section. Our next ""goal"" is Dalton, MA by Tuesday, July 5. Our packs will be heavy with food as that means 4 full days of food resupply. Thanks for following along. Safe travels to everyone over the 4 th. I so miss my family !!!","Falls Village, CT

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540407,"Today is day 99, Friday. I am currently at mile marker 1512.6. I covered 13.8 miles today. I am in MA!! I crossed the CT / MA border today. I have completed 10 states !! When I say that out loud...or even stop and think about it... I can't believe I have walked from Georgia to here!!!Last nights sleep, at the hostel, was very good. I was up and ready to go at 6. After coffee and cereal, Vanessa, the hostel owner, drove Snake, Little Kiss, Lucky Dog and myself back to the trail head. We knew we had two big climbs today and the weather was NOT going to be good in the afternoon. So, we started our hike pretty quickly but about an hour into it I received a text message from Snake, who had fallen behind. He indicated that he needed to rest a bit. We decided to stop and see if he could catch up to us. But, we received another text and he said he needed to turn around and go back to town. We then saw two south bound day hikers and we asked if they could check on him and maybe give him a ride back into town. Turns out they were both doctors. This fact made us feel batter. Fast forward : Snake went to the emergency room ... Test were run... Bottom line he was dehydrated. He sent a text an informed us that he was no longer mentally into the hike and he will head home tonight. Home is Florida for him... So he took a train to NY and will fly home on Saturday. He walked over 1500 miles!! He did an awesome job and we will miss him. Little Kiss, Lucky Dog and myself continued to hike... Quickly, as we could feel the weather changing. We made it to The Hemlock Shelter and now we are waiting for the storms. They are calling for sever weather with possible tornados. Yikes!!! I'm just glad to be in a shelter.","Sallsbury, CT

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540507,"Today is day 100, Saturday. I walked about 8 miles today ... And as I crossed route 7, near Great Barrington, MA., I decided to hitch a ride into town. It took about 15 minutes to catch a ride. When Rachel asked where I wanted to go... I paused and said, I really don't know. Maybe just drop me in the middle of town. As we drove the 4 miles into town I asked her to bring me to the Days Inn. I had NO intention of stopping in GB but when I came upon the road crossing ... My heart said to do it. I have struggled so much with the decision of staying on the trail or going home. I have received some great advice from former thru hikers, strangers and loved ones. The constant is.... Do what will make you happy. So, I am going to stay here for two nights.... Think long and hard and then make my final decision. I need to feel at peace with whatever I decide... And I know that. Here is at least one funny for the day: when I asked the clerk at the Days Inn if he had any rooms he said, yes. So I walked outside to tell my ride that I would be able to get a room. As I took my back pack out of her car, the clerk came outside to inform me that the rate was $225 a night. I am sure he saw total shock on my face and he then said , but I can give it to you for $155. I asked him to give me a minute. As I stood in the parking lot I called Chrissy and of course, I began to cry. Then the clerk came back outside and said.... Ok, I'll give you the room for $99!! I actually thought to myself.... Ok, I'm going to try that from now on whenever I travel. Cry and I might get a better rate. After checking in I gathered my clothes, the few that I have, walked to the Laundromat and washed clothes.    I then found the Mexican restaurant ... Had a margarita and chicken tacos. Now, I'll sit in my $99 a night room, relax and NOT think about my decision until tomorrow. Ironically, I received a message through trail journals (today) from someone who asked what was the toughest part of the trail .... For me it has been the mental. Yes, the physical is the toughest thing I have ever attempted but I can fight through that. But, the mental is constant... Even when sitting and having a snack. I think it is different for everyone but for me... The mental is by far the biggest challenge. Right now... I feel very good about sitting for the next day.","Hemlock shelter

Bunkie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540772,"After 100 days, 1520 miles, 10 states, tons of support, well wishes, advice, suggestions, questions and prayers I have decided that my Appalachian Trail journey is complete. I met such wonderful people both on and off the trail. I have made friends that will last a lifetime. My memories and lessons from the Trail will last forever. No, I did not make it to the official end of the trail but I feel as though my journey is complete. For those of you who are thinking.... Oh, you have gone so far, you are so close, keep going, don't stop, you will regret this decision, go home but...come back to finish, etc... I understand and appreciate your wishes for me but please remember.. This journey is and will always be something special to me and I am very proud of myself. I feel at peace with this decision. I have sat, relaxed, rested, talked to loved ones, visited with a dear friend, gave it lots of thought and to be honest (as I have been throughout) I do not feel the trail calling me back. As one former thru hiker (thanks Outliner) wrote to me: no matter how far you make it... The lessons you learned will last a lifetime. I believe that with my every fiber. Thanks to all who followed along and provided support to both myself and Chrissy. Most of all... Thanks to Chrissy for her love and never wavering support. Without her... None of this would have been possible. To all my trail Angels... On and off the trail you made me realize that there is so much goodness in this world. While we are all living during a time that so many bad things are happening around us ...we must not forget that we are blessed and WE need to be kind to others and hopefully that kindness will be contagious and passed forward... If you are thinking of doing a thru hike... Go for it! The journey will be YOURS to keep forever... However far you make it. To my fellow 2016 AT hikers... All of you rock. Thanks for sharing the trail with me.","great Barrington, MA
