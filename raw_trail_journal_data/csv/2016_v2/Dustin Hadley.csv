Dustin Hadley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508719,"I'm starting on the 6th anniversary of my cardiac arrest and one day after running a half marathon. I made a lot of progress since that fateful day, but I don't think I've fully healed emotionally. In training for the AT, I came across Jenni and Natalie on the Ice Age Trail doing the Warrior Hike to ""Walk Off the War."" Since that seems to be helping some soldiers, maybe it can help me with the rest of my own fight. I've always been a bit odd, but that seems exaggerated when I really beat the odds for survival.I was having a chat with Bookworm, who plans on hiking it again next year. Okay, the conversation was a few months ago. He got me thinking about how next year will be my best chance for this for what may be a long time. No wife/girlfriend, no children, no pets, and no home/mortgage--and I'm debt-free right now with almost a year to save.So, I hope for some emotional healing and fixing a bit of wanderlust. Maybe it won't help the latter so much, and I'll re-evaluate my career if my wanderlust gets worse. I also hope to meet some great people along the way, since Bookworm is one of the few people in my life right now that are actually active like I want to be.",,View Entry,"Aug 04, Tue",0
Dustin Hadley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508820,"What's the first thing many hikers do when they've decided on a major hike? Shopping spree.All right, mine was a bit more calculated. I went through and figured out what I already had. My sleeping bag wouldn't work, and my pads were either winter weight or old and the same weight but designed for summer--and I'm too old for the 1/2"" foam pad I liked in my early twenties (and also a side sleeper much of the time, which doesn't help).I was already tired of my tent (and old MSR that I think was cut or sewn wrong when they made the rain fly, as it's always been loose and touches the inner wall), so that made the list, but I was having trouble finding lightweight ones that were also in my budget and big enough for my 6' frame. I mainly had to pick two of the three. Thankfully, Bookworm reminded me of a brand I encountered the year before called TarpTent. I had to wait a bit to save up before buying, but the gist of it is good. While I repaired it, it was no help that I put a mid-size hole in the netting of my two-person tent on the first evening on the trail.A big advantage of living in Minneapolis is having Midwest Mountaineering so handy. They don't carry everything, but their products are more hiker-friendly than REI and the other local places that sell outdoorsy gear.With its proximity and my intention of hiking it in sections anyways, I decided to section hike the Ice Age Trail for training and shakedown. For my first section hike, I had issues I didn't yet know about. My pack was the biggest one. The size was potentially viable (60 L), but I'd only done short hikes with it before. I had no idea how horrible the frame was even though Gregory received numerous awards for this frame (it's a Triconi 60, but has the same frame as the Baltoro 70/75 series). It continually shifted on me and gave me serious hip issues by the end of my first day. It quickly made it to the top of my list for replacement, although I had hoped to wait until later because it was rated for more weight than the ones I was eying.My cookset was a mid-range set from my search and rescue pack. It was fine, but it's a two person set, so bigger pot, multiple bowls/cups, etc. Basically, a lot of extra weight when I could get down to a single pot and one cup. The alcohol stove needed tweaking, namely an aluminum wind screen, before it worked right. I plan to replace that with a cat food can with holes and see which works better, since that option weighs even less.Once the gear is figured out, time to think about clothing. I had luck with a pair of North Face shorts fitting well, so I bought a pair of their zip-off pants a couple of days ago. Haven't tried them yet, but we'll see soon enough. My old nylon shirt is discolored and otherwise showing its age, so I think I'll turn it into a bug shirt with some spray-in permethrin and see if I need to attach netting anywhere. Also, as much as I like my Fleet Farm hat, it isn't very well ventilated. My plan is to try Goodwill, Marshall's, or TJMaxx and find a wide-brimmed, soft hat that I can modify for both improved ventilation and possibly a bug net to flip down and protect my head.I'm open to other ideas, if anyone has input.",,View Entry,"Aug 05, Wed",0
Dustin Hadley,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518873,"A year-end wrap up and other update:I've been inactive for a bit; sorry for the few reading this. I've been working a lot of overtime to help save for this (I'm presently ahead of pace on savings--woohoo!). The downside is that meant several days I had hoped to spend on the IAT didn't happen (an illness didn't help that, either).However, I've made some good headway on preparation for the AT next year.Thanks to Booksmarts, I believe I've found a piece of rain gear and adjust my cook system. Midwest Mountaineering also had a nice sale last month on Merino wool, so I added a couple of base layers that are making the cut. I've even figured out decent shoes (more trail testing needed, but they've done well on light trails) and insoles.A really big step: I applied for the leave of absence. I've added two more weeks than I originally planned. It may take a few weeks to get approved as it is the holiday season and the main person to sign off on it is out until next week. However, my step was easier than expected and it cleared my direct supervisor's desk with her approval in about 90 minutes. I believe it even cleared the next rung in the ladder within a couple of business days. I've been asked to wait until after the 10th before bugging them on this, but they have until the 20th to make up their minds before it gets automatically denied (which they can reverse), so that's a reasonable time frame.Some mixed news--mostly sad, though. John, the other cardiac arrest survivor who was going to attempt a through-hike next year, had some family issues arise (great things, just poor timing) and will be delaying his hike for a year, but hopes to get on the trail with me for a shorter period of time. So, it sounds like I'll be going it alone for the first SCA survivor to complete the AT--an honour I had hoped to share with John. If my time off in 2017 permits, I'll see if I can join him for some of his hike.Assuming I get the leave approved, there are still some things to figure out. I need a better short-term home for my cello and violin (I think I have that figured out), a place to park my car for 4.5 months (a few ideas there, but nobody I've approached), confirming the person who can be my at-home helper (figured out, but confirmation and just-in-case paperwork still needed), and the ride to the airport after running a half marathon and parking my car. Nothing bad, just need to get done.I hope everyone else is enjoying time outside, making progress on their hike and/or preparations for it, and staying safe.","
