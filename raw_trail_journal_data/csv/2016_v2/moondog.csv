Thanks to Joe for giving me a ride here and hiking in for about a mile. It was a beautiful day for hiking. First time hiking with a full pack. A little harder going uphill compared to using a day pack. Still made thirteen miles to Mt. Wilcox North shelter. Hiked over East Mountain, through Ice Gulch, by Benedict Pond and ended on Mt. Wilcox. Cold night in the low twenties - warm in my sleeping bag.",,Mt. Wilcox North Shelter,"Nov 16, Mon",13

Shoulders are sore and legs tired. Otherwise it was a great hiking day. Hiking level and downhill are fairly easy. Made one five mile section in two hours this morning. Uphill is another story. Much slower. Met some day hikers today. One of them is planning to hike the AT, starting in March also. Hope to see him on the trail.",,Upper Goose Pond Shelter,"Nov 17, Tue",14

I made nine miles to October Mountain Shelter and listened to my body and stopped for the day at 1:30. Another great hiking day. It is supposed to rain tonight and tomorrow. I will stay in the shelter tonight instead of tenting. It's so quiet with no one else around. Also boring. Shoulders feel better today, but since my legs are tired, I stopped. Hopefully, the rest will be beneficial.",,October Mountain Shelter,"Nov 18, Wed",9

After a breakfast of mac and cheese, I headed out to make it to Dalton. Only had a few sprinkles during the day, but got a little wet because the trees and bushes were wet from the night rain. Made twelve miles to downtown Dalton. Was picked up by Joe and Jan at about 1:15. This was quite the experience. Can't wait to go to Georgia in March.",,Dalton,"Nov 19, Thu",12

It had rained hard during the night which made the dirt road slick. No problem for Duffy. We were all excited to get started, even in a light rain. I met Bald Eagle and , since we hiked at the same pace, we stayed together. The sun came out in the afternoon making the hike much more pleasant. Carrying a total of 44 pounds. Not my best idea. Thought we would have much cooler weather. Today's high was about 70. Hope it gets cooler so I can use my winter stuff. We made it to Hawk Mountain Shelter and settled in for a good night's sleep. Also met Elle, Camel, Umgawa, and Catfish Jon. Lots of great people having a fun time. Day 1 was great.","Springer Mountain

What happened to winter hiking??? Lance Creek campground was full, so we pushed on and found some flat space at Henry Gap. Got Gatorade, cookies, and chips from trail angel at Woody Gap. Great! Our tent site was near a woman's house and she told us we could get water from her tap. How nice.

Hiked with Bald Eagle and Nailgun. Beautiful views on Blood Mountain. We decided to get a cabin and treat ourselves to a nice comfy night.

I understand what MUDs and PUDs are for sure. We made camp quickly and ate early due to expected bad weather at night. Grumpy and Whisper, with Boomer the dog, joined us. We lucked out again and only had some heavy winds. It did get much cooler. We did here coyotes at night. This was the first evidence of wild life.","Rocky Mountain

I guess the last three big days took their toll on our bodies. It seemed more like twelve miles today. Anyway, we made it and Bald Eagle's wife, Robin, picked us up and into Hiawassi we went.

They left to pick up their daughter and will be back tomorrow to pick us up. Nail-gun and I did some shopping for supplies and then went to the post office to send some weight home to lighten the pack. Also got a shave and haircut.

Started hiking at 11:00. Can't thank Robin enough for all she did for us. She is a true Trail Angel. Didn't have my best legs as we started an immediate climb. As the day went on I felt better. Nail-gun and I were faster and forged ahead to Plumorchard Gap. Had some lunch until Bald Eagle and Chickadee arrived. When they were rested we continued. Nail-gun and I were so focused on the trail that we passed a campsite unknowingly and made it to Bly Gap in North Carolina. WOW!!! State number one is done. We camped here for the night with a lot of other hikers. We did 9 miles today in relatively short time. Felt good.","Dick's Creek Gap

In the afternoon we hiked 2.4 miles up Standing Indian Mountain and down 2.9 miles to Beech Gap. The total miles for the day was 12.1. Met One Shot yesterday and he was here already.

Then came Albert Mountain and the going got slower and slower. The last quarter mile seemed straight up. There was a fire tower at the top. Had lunch and felt much better. Best of all, this is the 100 mile point! Only 2100 more. We finished the day at Rock Gap camping area for 15.4 miles and a new high for a day. Then things got better - we noticed a shuttle through the woods and decided to go into Franklin from here. Nailgun's feet needed some attention. We are staying at a Budget Inn through tomorrow so Nail-gun can work on his blister. We stopped at the associated camp store and met Baltimore Jack. He is an AT legend - he has hiked the trail nine times. He gave us each a beer and we talked about hiking the trail. He gave us some great advice. Had dinner at a nice retro diner. Now the sandman is telling me goodnight.","Beech Gap

Nailgun went to a local outfitter and they fitted him with new shoes. The clerk was an expert on foot blisters. Bald Eagle showed up with his older daughter and son-in-law. We all went to dinner together and had a good barbeque meal. Good ol' southern cooking. When we got back to the hotel, the owner and his son were playing guitars and banjos. That was a lot of fun with a bunch of other hikers. Then, once again it was time for sleep. We will be ready to hike tomorrow.","Rock Gap

Really great. Franklin really likes the hikers. Then, the hotel shuttle took us back to Rock Gap. Nailgun and I met Bald Eagle and his daughter and son-in-law. We all hiked together for about 5 miles and then the young ones had to go back. The three amigos continued hiking for almost 12 miles. After the day off, it was a little hard to get going again. Of course, we had to go over two mountains. One was called Silers Bald. The trail did not go over the summit, but there was a side trail to the top. We climbed the quarter mile trail without packs to see the beautiful views and take some photos. The trail was steep and added to a long day. Nothing like a couple of big ups and downs. Met two older Australian men today. Had some interesting conversations with them. Flipper, GPS, and Spider-Man are camped here also. Dinner is done and time for sleep. We're hoping the rain misses us tonight. Another great day in this adventure.","Rock Gap

moondog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525089,"Well, we finally got some rain. Woke to wet tents, but we were able to pack up before more rain came. The rain was light in the morning. We went over Wayah Bald (moderate mountain) and came down to Burningtown Gap. There were trail angels on Easter Sunday with home cooked ham and cheese sandwiches and many other goodies. How nice of these folks. Talked with them while we ate. Said our thanks and good byes and headed up to Cold Spring Shelter. Nailgun and I decide to press on, but Bald Eagle said he had to stop for the day. We continued to Telico Gap and met our second trail Angels. They were from a local hiking club and had some nice snacks. Again, we gave them our profound thanks for being there on Easter. Then we headed up Wesser Bald for about 1.5 miles to a shelter and campground. Unfortunately, the inn was full, so we headed up and over the bald to stealth camp. At least the rain has held off so we could eat and get settled for the night. Rain is expected tonight and early in the morning. We will wait for dry weather to head down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center and get a room for the night. Hopefully, Bald Eagle will meet us there. Time for a good night's sleep. I updated yesterday's journal. Thanks again to all who send encouragement and best wishes. It helps to keep hiking on.","Wine Spring Campground

The trail was mostly downhill for the six miles with some steep rocky areas. The weather improved and we had some fabulous views. We made reservations to stay in a cabin-like building. It had 10 rooms that held 3-4 people. Got re-supplied for the next few days. Bald Eagle made it by mid-afternoon and we all enjoyed a beer together. This facility has a white water kayaking and rafting center. We saw some kayakers having fun. Had a good dinner of a large specialty hamburger and fries. Very yummy!

moondog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525354,"We had planned to go only about six miles today because the trail went up 3000 feet over six miles. Yesterday, we came down almost the same distances. Hence, this area is called the notch. We all felt good by the time we got to the top of the mountain that we decided to continue on to a campsite at the 10 mile mark. Today was the best hiking day for weather and views. We got tremendous views on the top of Cheoah Bald. Got some great photos and videos. Made it to the camping area and found about ten other hikers already set up. They included Smiles, Spider-Man, Grumpy, and Bill, all of whom we've seen over the past two weeks. Also met Mamba, who is from Munson, MA. He used to work in Lenox. What a small world. Had a good dinner of beef stroganoff (freeze dried of course). Finishing my journal from my sleeping bag. Time for nighty-night. See you tomorrow. This is a fantastic adventure.

When we got to Stecoah Gap there was trail magic in the form of apples. OK, this was special. Shortly after the trail magic, we started up Jacob's Ladder. This was a gain of 600 feet in 0.6 miles. Very tough. Once we conquered that, it went fairly well to Cable Gap Shelter and completed 11.6 miles. Good day.","Locust Cove Gap

I had to continue for one mile to get to the shelter as I will continue tomorrow. After getting settled at the shelter, I went back to the store to wait with the guys for their wives. We all went to dinner at the Lodge and saw other hikers there. I wasn't the only stinky one there. After dinner, they gave me a lift to the shelter and we said our goodbyes, at least for now.

It's mostly up until you get to Clingman's Dome with a lot of downs in between. Worked hard to make 13.9 miles today. It felt good to get this done. At the shelter, I met three trail maintainers. They had homemade chocolate chip cookies. Great! Bookcover, Bevo, Chaos, and Secret Agent also stayed here. Coyotes were in the area tonight. Will try a bigger day tomorrow.

moondog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526456,"This was my biggest day for mileage yet. 16.7 miles and I was pooped. Early in the day, I went over Rocky Top and Thunderhead mountains. Big up for the two summits, but couldn't see anything because the summits were engulfed in clouds. Oh well, continued hiking. Later I could see the summit (I guess I got there too early). Continued with ups and downs until the approach to Siler's Bald. The trail seemed to keep going up forever. I did trip and fall uphill, so it wasn't bad. Just clumsy from fatigue. Arrived at the Siler Bald Shelter and took a 15 minute rest. That made a big difference and I was able to continue the last 1.8 miles to the Double Spring Gap Shelter. Bright Bags, Mamba, Whisper, Bookcover, and Gentle Ben were there. A local hiker, Wildcat, and his wife were there also. Wildcat has completed the AT, Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail in the past. They had trail magic for everyone - snicker doodle cookies, cheese, pepperoni, and bread, and some Tennessee fire water. They had also gathered wood for a fire in the fireplace. The fire helped keep the shelter a little warmer at night. The temperature dropped to about 20. Glad I helped cut up the wood. The wind also kicked up to gusts of 40 mph (my guesstimate). Sleep was a little harder tonight with the wind. Just another day and night on the trail. Still a great day.","Russell Field Shelter

Helped get the fire restarted at 5:30AM and then went back to sleep. The day was clear however, which meant views would be available at Clingman's Dome. The trail was a steady, but manageable up to the summit and tower. This is the highest point on the AT. I guess it is all downhill from here (lol). Walked up the tower to a spectacular 360 view. Unfortunately, the wind made the cold unbearable and quickly took pictures and left. After, the trail went down until the next up and then down to Newfound Gap. Here, Mamba, Gentle Ben and I hitched a ride to Gatlinburg. Got a hotel room for comfort and cleaned up for dinner. After a steak and a couple of beers, it was time for a comfy sleep.

The three Musketeers were together again. Also, today is Bald Eagle's 66th birthday! Happy Borthday Bald Eagle!!! Nailgun and I moved out early ahead of Bald Eagle. It was a cool, windy morning. We didn't see Bald Eagle for the rest of the day. We stopped at the shelter, me doing 10.4 miles and Nailgun having done 15 miles. We thought Bald Eagle stopped at the previous shelter.

Then, just to make us feel better, the trail goes down for six miles with one small bump thrown in. Also, Bald Eagle had kept up with us yesterday, but missed the sign for our shelter and kept going to the following shelter. So he had put in a 20 mile day! We were all glad we would be together to exit the Smokies tomorrow. We did have spectacular views as we crossed the high peaks.

The mountain terrain was tough and the weather wasn't much better. However, it is a beautiful park. The only bear I saw was from the shuttle van when I left Gatlinburg. Of course this doesn't count. We exited the park and soon passed under Interstate 40. At this exit, Nailgun's wife was to pick him up for a surprise. She arrived about 5 minutes after we did. She had cookies and goodies as trail magic. A few other passing hikers were invited to partake and thoroughly enjoyed it. Bald Eagle and I said our goodbyes and headed the next mile up over a large hill to the Standing Bear Farm. This place was like an old 60's commune. The proprietor's name is Lumpy. He gave us the nickel tour after we selected our bunks. The laundry consisted of hand washing your clothes on a washboard and then putting them through the ringer (it would break buttons and zippers). There was an electric dryer. The store had many food and equipment items. You were on the honor system to write the items for purchase on paper and pay when you paid for the bunk. Beer was available, but Lumpy had to get it from a locked cooler and you had to pay cash. We met many familiar hikers from the past couple of weeks. Bald Eagle and Catfish Jon did a guitar duet for several songs. A lot of younger hikers had a lot of beer. It was an interesting evening, one I won't forget for a long time.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Now I am alone again as I head out at a brisk pace. After two miles of up, I am very fatigued. I have had a cold for a couple of days and that may be affecting me. I was taking a break, talking to Slinger when I heard voices coming up the trail. One of the hikers was Nailgun! He decided to hike today due to possible bad weather tomorrow. Glad to see him. He got me moving through a long tough day. He encouraged me up over Snowbird Mountain and then we continued on until we met his wife at Max Patch Rd. She was proving trail magic to hikers for several hours. What a trail angel. I had a great rest and snack of course. Again I said goodbye because Nailgun would take tomorrow as a zero day. I then continued to head towards Max Patch, a gain of over 900 feet in a mile. Carefree and Whisper, with dog Boomer, were close behind. Shortly, I missed a turn on the trail and they followed me. Fortunately, I realized my error quickly and we found the proper way to go. We summited Max Patch to winds of 40 mph and sleet and snow. Still took a few pictures before heading down.

From the time I started hiking I felt much better than yesterday. My cold is still here. The trail was fairly level for 4 miles and this made it easier to get the legs warmed up. Then came Walnut and Bluff mountains back to back. My legs felt good on the ups and I cleared the second summit, 7.3 miles, in three hours. I then made Garenflow Gap, 4.1 miles, in one and a half hours. Now I'm thinking I could make it to Hot Springs today. At the gap, a trail angel had hot dogs, chips, soda, beer, and sweet snacks. After filling up, it was time to get moving to finish the last 6.6 miles. I made it to the town by 3:30. I really felt good doing this - a new record for me. We'll see how I feel in the morning!

Then came two ups. The second one was hardest. I cleared Rich Mountain and was glad to see some down. Finally came Spring Mountain and up I went. It seemed to get steeper as I went higher. I finally reached the shelter and campsite. The weather was warmer today and I hiked in shorts and t-shirt. Nice after the cold and wind. Once the tent was set up the wind kicked up and it got cooler. Had a good dinner of Asian noodles and tuna fish. Nailgun called me and said he was 14 miles behind me. We should get together at Erwin.

The trail started mostly down this morning which made it easier to warm up the legs in preparation for the big up of the day. The day was clear so there were good views when on top of mountains. The best views came on Big Firescald Bald. This was a rocky ridge that required scrambling over larger rocks/boulders and climbing up to the ridgeline. There is an alternate route for bad weather - you don't want to be on this open ridge in a thunderstorm. It was windy, of course, but took many pictures. Then had to climb down the rocks on the other side of the ridge. This was tricky but fun.   A couple of miles later, it was time to make camp and enjoy a good dinner.

Started with a decent up, hiking over Big Butt Mountain. Not too bad of an up, then down the other side to a group of short ups and downs. Over the last month, I have come to understand the true meaning of MUDs and PUDs. These are mindless ups and downs and pointless ups and downs. You go up one side of a mountain and down the other side, just in time to do it over and over again. At least the rain stopped by late morning. The last big MUD was Lick Rock - up for three miles and down one and a half. Then the shelter was halfway up the next mountain. At least you get to use different leg muscles going up or down.

He had a Marine shirt on, so I asked if he was ever stationed at Camp Lejuene and he responded with an affirmative. Then I asked him his unit number. I couldn't believe it when he said 3/2 because this was my son's unit. It turns out he knows Alex and was even in the same platoon for a while. I called Alex immediately and he couldn't believe it either. Two Chains is a fast hiker. What would you expect of a Marine. After lunch there was another big up. A short rest at the top, there was a little level walk and then downhill to the shelter for the night. Stayed in the shelter due to rain tonight.

He was killed in a plane crash near this spot. Then it was a long downhill to a shelter for lunch. Since the shelter was off on a side trail, I had lunch at the intersection with Little Kisses. Joker continued on. After lunch, there was another big up. Little Kisses is a fast hiker, so I didn't try to keep up with him. Going up this next hill, the rain came back. Hike on! At the top was Dragon's Tooth, a stone monolith. Some people climbed up this rock, but not me in this weather. Then it was down a very steep trail over many large, flat rocks with big drops. Not fun on a good day let alone a wet day. I made it down the steep part ok and then while climbing over some other rocks my foot slipped and I fell, but not badly. Only a couple of scrapes. I finished the hill and came to the road. A short walk up the road led to the hostel. Eddie was the caretaker while the owners were at Trail Days in Damascus. I picked a bunk and Eddie said let's go. I didn't have time to clean up or change. He shuttled Joker and I to a local restaurant for dinner. One of the perks of this hostel. The restaurant, the Homeplace, served one meal as all you can eat.

I even sat down with my legs dangling over the edge. Not bad for not liking heights. Now we mushed on towards Tinker Cliffs, another area of great views as the trail winds along the cliffs. We ate lunch here before continuing. Now it was down until we came to Lamberts Meadow Shelter. Again, stopped for a brief rest. This shelter is closed due to bear activity. No signs of any bears. I left early because I thought they would catch me soon. Most of the rest of the miles were relatively flat. At least until near the end. I caught up to Little Kisses and Bug Juice who were doing the same hike with full packs. I hiked the remainder of the hike with them. As I mentioned, there was up, and it was very rocky, at the end.

This is more like it. Went through Gathland State Park, some Civil War history. No other exciting news during the rest of the hike until we reached the end for the day - Trail Magic!!! A section hiker was providing hot dogs, hamburgers, sweet treats, and drinks. What a way to end the hike. To top it all off Nailgun's brother-in-law picked us up to stay at his house. Before going there, he gave us a quick tour of the Antietam battlefield. Great Civil War history. Then we got cleaned up and went out to dinner. Big pasta plate for dinner. No trouble eating it all.

We weren't expecting to see them for a few more days but, today we got a good sample. The level section was very rocky. They slowed down progress a little and were painful to the feet. Then the trail started down to Duncannon. The down was steep with many many large rock steps. I'm glad I'm not a southbounder. Into Duncannon and I had lunch at the old Doyle hotel.

So, I found a place to stay the night (Bert's Steakhouse) to make plans for going home tomorrow. I met Yeti outside Bert's and we went in for lunch.

We crossed over the NY Thruway and headed up a ""nice"" hill. We made over that and later came to the ""lemon squeezer"". This is a very narrow passage thru rock walls. Just barely enough space to fit through with a pack. The walls weren't vertical either which made it more fun. Add in wet rock and dripping overhead and the joy just gets better. It really was fun and we made it thru. Then came an immediate rock climb straight up about six feet. I couldn't find a place for my feet, so I went around. That was easy. One more hill to climb and soon we would make it to a shelter for lunch. Almost there and Ranger Joe passed us again. About this time, Rebel said her ankle was hurting. Probably from several slips yesterday. We made it to the shelter and Sunoco had come up to meet Ranger Joe. Rebel was not going to be able to continue. Her ankle was swollen and sore. We put an ace bandage on it and she was able to make the one mile to the road. There, Sunoco picked her up and took her to a car rental dealer to head home. It was sad to see her go. We had a fun time hiking from PA. Ranger Joe and I hiked together for the next two miles where Sunoco would pick him up. I kept up with his fast pace, but it was work. We did it in 50 minutes.

The fog remains this morning. Everything is damp. There was one good up to a point where NYC is supposed to be visible. The fog got in the way. Continued downhill until reaching the Palisades Parkway. Hikers must cross this with no crossing aids. Morning City bound traffic was heavy. Waited for a break and dashed to the median. You don't want to be on the road with speeding New Yorkers. The other side was much easier. Next mountain to climb was West Mt. Another solid up was starting to take its toll on my legs as fatigue was appearing. No problem, just keep going. Finally got over the mountain and met a couple of section hikers. Now came the best part of the day - Bear Mountain. It starts easy on a road, but then the trail turns on to rock steps. Too many to count. Up and up on the steps made the knees feel great. Then the normal trail thankfully appeared. Of course there was still up to go. Near the summit the trail becomes a tiny stone trail, very pleasant. Almost to the summit and I came across three Deer. I guess they are used to people because they didn't run and let me take their pictures. Made it to the Perkins Memorial Tower. Fog still prevented seeing NYC. At this point, I have passed the 1400 mile mark. Now we go down the mountain. It starts out on a road and then normal trail. Soon you get to steps. Many, many, many steps. I saw a jogger going up the steps. Before I got to the bottom, he passed me going down. When I reached the bottom he was started up again. And people think I'm crazy doing the AT. At the bottom were signs describing the work to install the rock steps . There are a thousand steps coming down. If that doesn't make your knees ache. I had lunch at the park at the bottom and gave my legs a rest. From here the trail goes through a zoo. When you pass the Bear cage you are at the lowest point on the AT. Just a little further to the bridge and I called the motel for a ride. Into my room and I spread everything out to dry. My resupply package had arrived. They did my laundry and I got some supplies. My old trailmate, Bald Eagle, said to call his father-on-law if I needed anything. I called him and he planned to pick me up in the AM to bring me to a hardware store.

moondog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566139,"I was up at 6:15, though not totally awake.  I packed up and ate breakfast and got on the AT by 7:30.  Today was going to be, what else, up and down.  The wind blew hard all day.  Showers were in the forecast.  The trail started up immediately, but not terribly.  The legs were a little slow to start with, but this is not unusual.  About an hour into the day, I caught up with the section hikers and slowed to their pace because I think I sometimes go too fast and get too tired.  My legs were still a little shaky.  We continued on a passed a pond and saw evidence of a moose, but of course, no moose.  We did encounter enough of the ""Vermud"".  We reached the Congdon Shelter and I ate lunch.  I was feeling pretty tired by this time and only 7 plus miles done.  I decided that this was going to be the end of my backpacking for this season.  It didn't make any sense for me to continue on and not feeling strong enough.  This is very bothersome.  I have lost about 15 pounds and haven't figured out a good way to try to keep some weight on.  As it turned out, the section hikers were leaving today at the highway and offered me a ride.  At this point I accepted.  We left the shelter after lunch with some more up and down.  It started to sprinkle as we got to the top of Harmon Hill.  We are now headed mostly downhill towards Route 9.  We came to the steep down section and the rain just had to pick up.  There were many large rock steps on the way down.  The farther down we went, the harder the rain picked up.  This steep, rocky section continued right down to the highway.  No rest for the weary.  A couple of slips, but no falls for any of us.  We reached their car in a steady rain and loaded packs in the trunk.  The guys gave me a ride all the way home as they had to pick up a car in Cheshire.  What nice trail angels at the end.  It's time to end this section now, but I could be back next year.  After all, I am a section hiker.  Keep hiking and have fun!","Seth Warner Shelter
