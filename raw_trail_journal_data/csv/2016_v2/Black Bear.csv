Black Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530483,"Hi Everyone, I am so pleased to announce that I am back for Round II. I completed my first thru hike September 9, 2016 six months after my start. At that time I said, ""One and done."" I could not believe that people actually would do it again. When I asked a fellow hiker why he had done the A.T. so many times, his only reply was ""Ask yourself that question after you have been home a month"". It took me about 2 months before I wanted to hike again. Last month I toyed with the idea of section hiking my favorite spots with my husband. This week I decided to thru-hike again with my friend and hubby will join us when he can.This time I won't have to spend so much time researching gear. I know what I liked and didn't like. I can just enjoy this prep year and replace the few times I need.Happy Hiking here we come.",,Round II,"Apr 29, Fri",0
Black Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532987,"Since this will be my second thru hike, I thought planning would be a little ho-hum. But it's not. It's just as exciting as the first go around. In fact, it may be more exciting now that I know what to expect. My list of what to do differently is growing rapidly.Happy Hiking",,Just as Exciting,"May 08, Sun",0
Black Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532990,"Yesterday I went on my first hike that did not involve walking our dog in the surrounding woods where we live since I returned from my 2015 thru hike last September. It felt so good to get back outside and on a trial. It's about time I started taking off some of the extra ""fluff"" I put on around the mid-section after my return.
I was joined by my friend, Sharon (Shortcake) and her feline buddy, Ellie. It was her Idea to take a drive to the coast and hike Jordan Pond. In fact, it was her idea to hike the A.T. in 2015 but she was unable to. I went anyways. She is planning to go in 2017 and I said I would do it again with her. She doesn't have a trial name at the moment but is toying with the idea of ""Shortcake"". She is vertically challenged more so than myself, a baker, she is sweet and everyone loves her, just like shortcake. We'll see if the name sticks come next year.
Jordan Pond is a small body of water formed by the Glacier. The water is crystal clear and used as a water source for a near by town. The trail around the pond is a flat, short 3.5 miles of a smooth, gravely bed on one side of the pond and a rustic, split log boardwalk on the other side. An A.T. hiker's dream! We were not out for any strenuous or challenging hike, just a leisurely day in the sun. First true nice day of spring we have had.
We took a side bar part way around the pond to climb up South Bubble, a beautiful rock formation on the southern end of the pond. It's sister peak is North Bubble. This wasn't in our original plan. South Bubble ascent is a scant 400 foot elevation climb, but it is pretty straight up with rock steps, and a section of scrambling we were unable to do because of the Ellie. We will return another day to tackle that. Even though we could not continue we were pleased we went as far as we did. The view was stunning back out over the pond and as far as the eye could see out over the Atlantic.
While we were climbing up we stepped aside for an elderly man and his son to pass. The senior man's name was Fred, and he was 92 years of age. He didn't look a day over 70. The duo had hiked from the far side and were doing the 1.7 mile loop. 92 years old and he was out doing this short, yet moderately challenging hike. A family of four tourists were also out. They were a very nice mom, dad, brother and sister family enjoying what Maine had to offer. As young and as fit as they looked on the outside, they had to stop several times and rest. They did not even attempt the rock scramble. They didn't even have a dog as an excuse. At one point I thought the dad was going to keel over on the spot. they still were smiling and enjoying their hike as challenging as it was for them. But the heart of this almost century old man was full of life. Each of his steps were methodically and purposeful but it did not slow him down one bit. It was inspiring to watch him.
What does this post have to do with the A.T. and sharing with you? If you are just reading to live vicariously thru my experiences then enjoy. If you are looking to take away a nugget to help you with your thru hike. Here are three tips.
1) Don't be afraid to take that side bar for the extra view. You never know what you will see. Isn't it why you are going to be out there?
2) Age doesn't matter. It's all about heart. When the dream is big enough the facts don't count.
3) Take time to meet and greet other hikers. It will make your experience that much more enriching.
and last but not least
4) Even when things are tough and you can't go on, smile and enjoy what you can.

Black Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535905,"I am getting Gear-Up. The big three, Pack, Tent and footwear will be a no-brainier for me. I will use the same pack I did in 2015. A Hyperlite Mountain Gear 3400 Windrider but in black this time. I will use a Hubba Hubba tent by MSR and Cresta Hiking Boots by LL Bean. As soon as I figure out how to post photos to my gear section I will add them. I will also use the same poles. Black Diamond Pro Shock poles. Hope you are having fun getting Geared-Up.Happy Hiking",,Geared Up - The Big Three,"May 31, Tue",0
