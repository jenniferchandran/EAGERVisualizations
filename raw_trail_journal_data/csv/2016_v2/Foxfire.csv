This is a very rustic quaint hostel where I was greeted by the caretaker Lumpy who walked me around the facilities consisting of the shower, restocking store, kitchen, bunkroom and laundry room (washing machine is a tub with a washboard). Since I really wanted to sleep and not listen to snoring, Lumpy let me stay in the ""couples room"". The bed was made of some kind of discarded iron parts and the room was decorated by spider webs in the corners but the soothing sound of the stream out back and the private patio made it a great experience!","
