Ancap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555954,"I'm excited that I'm fully committed to at least starting the trail. I saw a presentation on the Appalachian Trail by a retired pediatrician in Tipton, IN named Jim Dashiel. I went on to listen to David Miller's ""AWOL on the Trail,"" especially since it's available for free with Amazon Prime. Why the trail? Bordering on TMI, I believe the trail offers a good forced extension of sobriety from hard usage of a certain addictive substance. When you see casual usage morphs into something that cuts you off from even wanting to communicate with the outside world, when it facilitates getting anxious when a source is jailed, and is the catalyst for being lachrymose when you're sobering in the face of other people using (jealousy of people using a substance, something, anything, has to change. It also is a way to get physically fit. I've been oscillating in a 100 lb range over a 4 year period, which would be absurd for a smaller person but I am a tall (6'3"") exomorph. Finally, sitting all day is not doing it for me. What are people waiting for? Death? Where are we going? I'm no longer satisfied with the couch being my destination. Human beings are are built for something more. They have been genetically engineered by nature to outpace any animal over a long enough distance. When a human being is in this type of optimized shape their genetic code tends to express itself in a much more aesthetically pleasing manner (hence reason two for this hike). I'm staged in Hudson, Florida for another week while the trail warms up enough to not get rained on in the day and freeze at night. I'll start the trail on March 17 after taking a bus from Orlando to Atlanta on the 16th and staying in a hostel (so long as the shuttle I'm trying to coordinate works out).",,"Appalachian Trail Head, GA","Mar 09, Thu",0
Ancap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556165,"I've gotten one quote for the cost of a shuttle to the trailhead. Ron's Appalachian Trail Shuttle quoted me a price of $120.00, paid in full upon reservation. I'm hoping to find a cheaper price or some way to group myself with others in order to get a fraction of the price. For a single ride there, that is more than reasonable of a price. But I'm thinking my request time, starting March 16th at 5:30-6pm (when I arrive in Atlanta) probably means it'll be just me. I'm trying to do the trail on a budget and am even bringing all the computing devices I need to keep earning money while on the trail. I have a money amount in mind that I want to have on my card when reaching the trail. If I have about a thousand dollars to start, I can write when I have cellular service and keep my income coming in. If anyone has any suggestions, e-mail me. I am willing to shuttle the morning of the 17th as well.",,Atlanta Shuttle to Trail,"Mar 12, Sun",0
Ancap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556603,"I'm leaving Florida today and heading to Atlanta to begin the trail. This will be my first time on the trail and I'm nervous. First I'm nervous because I am on a harsh budget and will have to earn money on the trail with my freelance writing. While I'm prepared to do that, with an iPad Pro with cellular connectivity, I hate the fact that I'm perpetually busy. I've had to ignore everyone around me for the past week in order to be able to afford much of my supplies. I read about someone who started the trail with 500 dollars, paid a shuttle a lot of money, and had to drop out 2 weeks later. I'm starting with less cash on hand, more accounts receivables, and credit I'm waiting to show up on my credit card so my Uber as shuttle can work out tomorrow. The trail is cold. That is also worrisome. I'm a big guy and don't mind a little cold. I generate a lot of heat while walking and I delayed my start for a week for temperatures to come above freezing. But have I ever slept outside in sub freezing temperatures? I don't think I have. I have a sleeping bag that is rated for 32 F, but like I said I'm on a budget and it seems like cheap products with false labeling have flooded the markets pretty pervasively. If I can pull it, I'm bringing an extra small blanket. I still have some money to earn this afternoon and tomorrow while on the bus and possibly while being driven to the trail. I love the fact that I can work wherever I'm at. My biggest bill is my phone bill and money I will send back up to Indiana for my daughter. Speaking of my daughter, I think the trail will help me get fit and focused. That's a lot of expectation from an inanimate thing, but I think it can be done. I don't want to be the guy who leaves the trail broke, begging for donations for a bus ride home. I want to be able to thrive under pressure and be an asset to others. I've been going through AWOL's narrative of the trail again. He was way more prepared than I will be. I've seen pictures of people on the trail, mainly younger people, and it seems like they all have really nice clothing for the trip. My intentions are to get a new wardrobe half way through, or maybe up near PA where my brother lives. An outfit or two. If I can focus as much on the trail on getting work done, getting in good shape, congealing my rhythm with that of the sunrise and the sunset (your girlfriends an actress, did you really think she'd stay!) then I think I can improve my life. This should be all about enjoying the journey and never having an end goal in sight. Enjoy the journey and you enjoy life. So far I am enjoying the journey as much as is feasible at the movement. After a weeklong withdrawal from speed, withdrawing from caffeine, and doing my dam best to start eating healthy I am once again positive in my accounts and not dumping clients due to being scatter brained. I share too much, maybe too often. But I want that to be part of who I am. These aren't good conversation starters, but they are things I wish for people to know about my struggles. The hardest challenge for me at the moment might be the physical aspect of it all. I'm 320 lbs (though people claim they'd never of guessed a number that high).",,Atlanta,"Mar 16, Thu",0
Ancap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557387,"As I write this it is roughly 31 degrees, I’m wrapped in a blanket, and waiting for the sun to rise. I didn’t get much sleep. I have to sleep with my sleeping bag open because I’m a big guy, the bag isn’t as big as I want it to be, and it is rated for 32 degrees. I’m glad a brought this blanket as a supplement. Yesterday I hiked the Appalachian Approach Trail. There were moments I felt really good and moments I felt miserable. Amicalola Falls was beautiful and brutal. At this point in the hike the attrition rate is really high. I understand that now. It’s not that people don’t like a little discomfort, there is a lot of it. I’m anxious about the small amount of food I brought. I slept on the bottom half of the shelter and kept remembering the story Rock told me, the first night, about a bear dragging a person out of their tent (that person was okay, the bear was probably looking for a bag of food and not a human). 3 others slept up top. A mother and her son, and a guy I met on my first night with a trail name of Shazam (or something similar). I have work to get done. One of my clients agreed to a 3-4 day deadline. Another is waiting for some edits, the sooner the better. I’m feeling more positive than the above narrative might seem. I shivered, I’m hungry, and I’ve barely slept but I have a feeling that the human body is more capable than what our modern lives put it through. One thing I really appreciate is meeting some people my first day who were very encouraging. Without having stepped food on the trail, my plans to through hike sparked a good amount of conversation and generosity. David, Phil, Carolyn (from Detroit!), a boy named Brandon, and a girl (I didn’t catch her name). Phil gave me a headlamp to use (which I’m using presently) as well as some trail snacks (all of which I’ve consumed). Those trail snacks, btw, were the most tasty thing ever when I was sitting at a water source, filtering water, and getting rehydrated from a long day of sweating. I’m pretty sure I didn’t bring nearly enough food and those calories (along with some PayDay candy bars I bought on the way out) will help me to get the 40 plus miles to the resupply place (a bit over 30 miles as of typing). My bag weighed in at 34 lbs. This is a decent weight for a bag but there might be too many food compromises. I need to stop being anxious about that and conserve what I have make up for it later. They key will be to hike over 10 miles per day and make sure I hit the resupply place with less days passed than more. I saw two father/daughter combinations walking. Not sure if the first set intend to through hike or not (nor if he is her father) but they had a pretty good pace and what seemed like forced breaks. Maybe I should force myself to rest more often. The second girl (who hasn’t been dubbed with a trail named yet) seems like she will be a prolific hiker. Her father is staying with her for the first month and she is hiking through. I met a guy named Travis who also intends to hike through but said he was questioning everything about life after hiking up Amicalola falls. He claims a stubbornness that might get him through the trail. I passed roughly 5 through hikers and probably as many passed me. The attrition rate, of course, is 75 percent or greater (I heard the statistic that 85 percent quit in the first 15 miles… that might be corrected as 85 percent of those who quit, quit in the first 15 miles). I was contemplating the half life of attrition after I made it up the first set of inclines. I said to myself, “Every mile I hike is a mile more I’ll likely hike.” Nassim Taleb once said something like, “A rule of thumb on knowing how long a business will last is knowing how long it has already lasted.” This is probably true of hikers, though no one seems to know the states. Every day I make it increases the likelihood that I’ll go all the way. I almost don’t want to update anyone until I’m 50 plus miles in, resupplied, and have gotten my work done. I wanted to go into how the trail is analogous to life, baggage that seemed necessary becomes unnecessary, but my fingers are cold and the sun has risen. Also, sometimes the most important things in life can’t go with you on the trail. Maybe someday I can take my daughter.","Atlanta

Ancap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557398,"I fell asleep on Justus Mountain twice in a car depleted emotional mess. Someone came to me, sat beside be, talked me up, got me moving and paced me in. We call him ""Bill Murray."" Great guy. It's not that the food I had wasn't enough, it was the wrong kind entirely. I need more carbs. Period. I was trying to trigger Ketoisis and that's a stupid time to start. I made it.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Ancap,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557400,"**24 miles since last entryI'm loaded up on carbs and now I'm more of a beast on the trail. My brother is now piecing together one of the most memorable days of my life. We climbed Blood Mountain starting right outside of bear canister territory, got to the best time lapse place availed, froze in the piercing winds, and got the clip. It was beautiful. The sun rose with my moon. I've been through some challenges that make me focus less on the distractions of life and more on having fund while surviving in nature (in a way). I think it's time for me to leave the group I'm hiking with. I've learned a lot from them and I don't plan to outdistance them, but I need my time. I've spent a little too much time with them and I need to spread out more. I don't want to get too attached. A trail buddy is going home today. Elizabeth. I got to know her more today than before. Confessed a few of the reason I'm on this trail. I'm happy.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
