Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522120,The time is fast approaching! Most of our gear has been acquired and we have been on several multi day shakedown hikes in a variety of weather conditions. The list of things we need to get done is still daunting but excitement is driving us on. There are 41 days remaining which includes 3 different weddings. Two of those weddings are out of town. 41 days still feels like a long time to me because of how excited I am. Luckily Melissa has been there to keep me rooted in reality. Sometime recently it has finally set in that pending calamity we are actually going to go!,,Welcome to our 2016 northbound Journal,"Feb 29, Mon",0
Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527127,"Preparing for the hike has been much more work than I could have imagined. We made countless lists of things to buy or make and an even longer list of things to do. Slowly all of the lists dwindled down to nothing on Thursday night. Instead of being relieved and relaxed at finally being done my body decided it was time to be afraid. I guess once the tasks were all done it all felt real for the first time. We had the gear, the money, the time, the plane tickets, and our possessions all secured and put away for six months. All that's left to do is get to Springer Mt and hike...We woke up early (330am) Friday morning and flew to Texas for one of Melissa's best friends weddings. I woke up to my nervousness being gone thankfully. It has been replaced by excitement. We will head to the trail from here on Sunday!We sent our packs down to Texas with a friend who was driving and we were very happy to be reunited with them last night. Thanks Felipe! He will also be giving us a ride to the trail on Sunday/Monday! That saves us from an 18 hour bus ride through the night. We haven't hike a mile yet but have been supported and helped so much by friends and family!",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Sat",0
Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527463,"Well we made it! We are in the shelter at the foot of the approach trail. We start our adventure in the morning. A very big thanks to Felipe for driving us from Texas! It made for a great stress free start! We are all set up for bed, our stomachs are full and it looks to be good sleeping weather.We spent the day getting some great photos at the falls here with Felipe and can't wait to see how they turn out. We climbed 425 slippery stairs to get to the top. Tomorrow is a very difficult 8 miles up to Springer Mt....",,We have arrived!,"Apr 11, Mon",0
Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527644,The approach trail was challenging but very doable. We arrived at springer mountain at about 245! We went to Springer Mt shelter to set up and have dinner and have returned to the summit of springer to watch the sunset over the north Georgia mountains on a cool clear evening. We have met some cool people so far and can't wait to see what the journey will bring! I will add a picture later when we connect to wifi,"visitors center

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541760,"Day 1 AT April 12, 2016Last night we got into our first shelter at amicalola falls state park. We met two guys, zack and James. Zach is a young skinny guy who says this is his first time camping in his life and he is attempting a through hike. James is an older guy who beat cancer three years ago and is turning 68 years old today. He was determined to hike in Spain but decided to do a few days in the AT. His few days turned into 6 weeks... Today we woke up at 7:45am and for my pleasure, my sleeping pad had completely deflated. Our camp stove didn't work right away and we lost a lighter and our rock bag for hanging the food backs. We worked out all of these slight setbacks and are getting ready to hike the approach trail today. Wish us luck.We made the trek up the approach trail that runs 8 miles. It is said to be the toughest climb in GA. The 8 miles was definitely slow going and felt more like a 16 mile day, but ultimately was very doable. At 9:30 am We started with a very steep stairway up a waterfall and then only went up from there. We made it to the AT starting point at 2:45 with a foggy but beautiful view of the surrounding mountains. After talking to a few other folks for a bit, we made it to springer mountain shelter by about 3pm. After arriving, we got set up and made our first AT ramen dinner. I was dehydrated and felt sick for about an hour. Luckily Mike took good care of me and made me drink water and lay down. He has been such a huge support from encouraging me while walking up hills to giving me back rubs to make my tummy feel better. I couldn't ask for a better teammate.","springer mountian shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527930,"Day 2 April 13, 2016""Everyone knows that pine trees are romantics""- mike Last night was brutal. There was 6 people staying in the shelter and 3 of them snored like monsters. We tried to go to bed around 9pm, and most people did. I on the other hand lay awake listening to the choir of snoring men until about 11:30. As frustrating as this was, I didn't know what to do. I tried pulling my sleeping pad out in front of the shelter but the wind was so vicious and cold that I could not stay out there. I moved back inside and lay there. It didn't help that every twenty minutes I had to blow up my sleeping pad again due to the slow leak. Finally, Mike started moving around. This was my chance. I felt bad but I leaned over and whispered "" love, are you awake?"" He responded to me so I asked him if I could set up the tent. I was at the point of tiredness and frustration that I could not stand to be in there any longer. Mike was clearly frustrated with my suggestion but said sure. I grabbed the tent and quickly set up the tent in the dark. As I finished, Mike came over to help set up. It was done. I went and grabbed the rest of my stuff to move into the tent. Mike stayed in the shelter to guard the rest of our stuff. The rest of the night was windy but without the loud snoring, I was able to catch some sleep. I woke up at 7:30 and packed up the tent and all my stuff before waking Mike and making breakfast. We chatted with other hikers and set off for an easy day. Along the first stretch of trail, we felt like we were in a tropical jungle. It was so incredibly beautiful as we walked along a stream with thick leaved dark green plants filling our view. A while later the terrain would change to ginormous pine trees that towers above us. Mike and I found so much joy in being in this amazing place together, recognizing the wonderful blessings that God has allowed us to take part in. We made our way passing other hikers, stopping, and getting passed, then catching up and ultimately being the first ones to the shelter. We stopped by a large waterfall to have lunch before we stopped for the day and it was definitely worth the extra time off the trail. Once at Hawk shelter, we pitched a tent so we could get a good quiet night sleep. The other hikers we had met along the way showed up and we chatted. There was Ben, square peg, Alex, Lou, and bones. Square peg had completed a through hike last year and was giving tips to us. We were all able to make dinner and relax for the remainder of the evening as other hikers began to show up.","Springer Mt shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527931,"Day 3 - April 14, 2016Today we woke up at around 7:30am and diligently made breakfast and broke down our tent. We were able to head out to the trail about an hour and a half later. Today was only an 8 mile day, but had two larger mountains to climb. Mike kept saying that today we would meet Sassafras and Justus and the guys who struggled before    weren't going to like meeting them. I thought that was the trail names of some old couple who stayed at the next shelter or were care takers that were rude or didn't take kindly to people who were inexperienced. Turns out it was the names of the two large mountains we climbed. They were difficult but we powered right up them passing a few groups. Up high on the mountains we had beautiful views on both sides of us. When we got into the valleys, it felt like we were in a tropical jungle. The day went by fast and we made it to the Gooch shelter. Only square peg made it in ahead of us and he left before 7am. The ridge runner keeping up the shelters was a younger guy who's name was Kenneth. He seemed to keep to himself a bit. Others trickled in over the course of the next few hours. We has eaten our last ramen noodle packs and took stock of the rest of the food we had. With a day and a half to go before result, we had enough food for two breakfasts, two bagel and peanut butter lunches, and many KINDbars to hold us over for dinner and snacks. I personally have been craving more salty foods and don't thing what is left is that satisfying, but it will keep me alive for the next few days. Now, Mike wants me to clip his toe nails so I am stalling by journaling right now...","hawk mountian shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528062,"Day 4- April 15, 2016Today we left Gooch mountain shelter around 9am and hiked a fairly easy day. When we got to the parking lot at woody gap, a guy called magic hat asked us if we were through hikers and said he had some trail magic for us! We had strawberries, bananas, and dried okra. He also had beers and burgers that he was doing later. We opted out of waiting for the burgers cause the place we are camping tonight doesn't have a privy... After the generous lunch, we hiked up a mountain to a beautiful view of the endless mountains in the distance. The wind was harsh and cold but we survived. Not too long after, we made it to a camp site for tents only. There was only about 4 built sites and over all about 7 usable spaces for the campers. This is an issue cause while there are only 7 available flat surfaces, there is potentially over 20 hikers looking to stay the night. The next further camping area or shelter is about 3 miles away but it is a requirement for anyone staying the night to have a bear canister. Apparently a certain bear was relocated to this area because he got in too much trouble elsewhere with getting into people's food bags. Now, it is a $400 fine for staying the night in that area without a bear canister. Hikers don't use them cause they are so darn heavy. That area lasts for about the next 7 miles and the next shelter after that is ten miles from our current camp site. So that is the predicament.. How will we fit 20+ campers in 7 spaces? We got in early and set up, so we don't have a problem. Accept for the really nice guy next to us who snored me out of the shelter three days ago...","Gooch mt shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528342,"Day5- April 15, 2016Today we hiked from lance creek to Neals gap which was just about 8 miles and over Blood mountain. We woke up at about 6:15 and got on the trail by 8am. Mike received his trip name today. Due to his ongoing responsibility to drink the remainder the gross coffee water with leftover oatmeal bits in the morning that I will not finish,he has received the name ""Dregs"". Anyhow, the first four miles were up hill, peaking at an elevation of 4,461ft, our highest yet. Along the way we passed a few people we've been acquainted with, an older couple, red tornado and jack. Later we passed two other men on the trail. As we worked our way up the mountains the trees changed from large pines to mountain laurel that encapsulated us in a jungle of wild and wavy tree branches. Towards the top, the trail became bedrock. We reached the top of the mountain at about 10:55am and looked over an absolutely beautiful view of the surrounding mountains. We met a ridge runner, Bill, who pointed out our start point for the day. It looked so far away I couldn't believe we were just there a few hours ago. It looked like it could have been where we were a few days ago. The remainder of the trail for the day only took us another hour. We went straight down the mountain passing all the first day hikers coming in for a beautiful Saturday hike. There were tons of Boy Scouts that seemed to have endless energy coming up this tough climb, and their leaders fighting to make it up. Once we reached Neals Gap, we went to Mountain Crossing, a re supply store. Outside of the store was a large tree full of hiking boots from previous hikers. We went in and did a pack shake down to eliminate any unnecessary items and send them home as well as replace my leaky sleeping pad. We then walked down to the Blood Mountain Cabins and rented a cabin. It was 72$ for 4 people so it split down to $18 per person and had free laundry service. A much better deal than the $18 hostel cramped full of smelly snoring hikers who pay an additional $5 per person for laundry. We asked our new friends Maddy and Ben to stay with us and they were delighted. Once we got our cabin and ate two pizzas, we walked back up to Mountian Crossing to meet up with Ben and Maddy. Unfortunately, at Mountian crossing, we saw an ambulance and were told Red tornado fell just short of where we were and possibly broke her arm. We saw many of our other new friends hanging out at some picnic tables. There was Gains and his dad Brad, michelle- now Lightning with her dog Thunder, Brooklyn and Matt, Alex 1.0, and Lou. We chatted for a while and others showed up. Once Benji and Maddy showed up, we went back down to the cabins and got some more food. Our neighbors ended up being other friends of ours, Hoot, pad foot, rook (Zach from the first day), and grits. Maddy went over to the hostel where most other hikers stayed at and returned not too long after with bones. They said that the hostel seemed dreary and had no windows, in the basement of a building. We were great fun for our cabin. After chatting for a good while, we settled in for the night. Mike and I shared a full size bed that sloped towards the middle and was extremely uncomfortable but it beat our other option by a lot. We had a great time with some great people that we really hope to see again soon.","lance creek camp ground

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528432,"Dregs (mike) here this timeToday was another great day. Out longest hiking day on this adventure so far, 11.5 miles. We are 43.2 miles into the trail (not including the approach trail) and so far all is better than expected. I am having foot pain in my heels that I think is related to plantar fasciitis that hurts very badly at times in the evenings. Both Melissa I are still dealing with one blister each. We are slowly increasing our mileage and easing our bodies into it. Tomorrow will be over 12 miles possibly longer if all goes well. We continue to be blessed with perfect hiking weather. It was a rather sad morning as we said goodbye to a couple trail friends Matti and Benji. We had a good time relaxing and talking over breakfast with them at the cabin. They are staying behind to rest one more day before continuing on. We hope to see them further on down the trail. The first half of the day was tough with rocky ups and downs. It warmed up quick because of our late start and our packs were heavy again with a 3 day resupply of food. On the way to our biggest climb of the day I got to give a buddy a trail name. I recommend the name Gandalf the Green and he liked it. He has long hair, he uses a staff instead of trekking poles, and you can figure out the green part. The climb up Wildcat mountain was short and steep but was over quickly. At the top our planned lunch stop was a shelter that turned out to be 1.2miles off the trail, we skipped that and found lunch and water at the bottom.We took our first long lunch and lounged by some downed trees. It was hot for the first time today so I mixed up some flavored electrolyte drink and we sat for almost an hour. The second part of our hiking day which was 4.6 mi was long but easy. There was a 2.5 mi stretch of some actually flat hiking. The last 1.5 miles dragged on and on with 3 mountain in a row that I thought (and told Melissa) were the last mountain. We got into low gap shelter and met a Swedish guy who was very friendly. There was a group already here who all started on the same day and all hike together. As we did our chores we made friends with Cosmo(not a trail name) and comet. A bit later Brooklyn and Gandalf the Green showed up and we all ate together and chatted. Curry rice for dinner was great but hard to clean up. Bones an Gains showed up and it almost felt like the old crowd was still together. We also met Kim and Carol (sisters) Lots of people we were hiking with are behind us now but we know we will meet more. Melissa and I are laying in our tents and readying ourselves for another night under the stars.","blood mountian cabins

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528605,"Day 7- April 17, 2016The first half of the day was easiest and the second half was the hardest. We woke up at 6:15 and got on the trail by 7:45. We switched from a hot meal in the morning to dry meals of pop tarts to save on time in the morning. We are almost out of coffee so I decided to just stop drinking it and Mike could ween himself off it. Instead of brewing some hot water, I saw Mike take a swig of his water and a spoonful of instant coffee and just swish it together in his mouth... Gross. He said it was fantastic! After leaving low gap shelter, we had an easy 8 miles of flat. It was the easiest part of the trail I have ever done. With the great pass we were making we had a few options for stopping points, either stop after 12 miles at Cheese factory camp site or go 16 miles to Tray Mountain shelter. We decided on Tray Mountain. The second set of 8 miles was devastating on our knees and feet. It would consist of walking straight down a mountain for about an hour, going up a tall steep mountain, back down and all the way up another to the shelter. It made a W shape looking at the map. While on the decline, our knees were taking all the shock of big step downs with our additional 30lb packs. Going up the mountains seemed to go on forever. Over all, I'd have to say for the first time, I prefer up hill. It puts much less strain on my body and I feel like my trail legs are coming in. Mike and I rarely have had to stop while going uphill and seem to be able to power through for long periods of time. After the first decent, we came to a parking lot full of people. It was a church group offering burgers and power aid and other snacks for through hikers. This is called trail magic. We were delighted to have a few burgers and chat with the group and other people stopping through. It gave us a nice break and took our minds off the difficult trail for a bit. We learned from other hikers that red tornado, the older lady who fell at Neels gap broke her neck and had to be airlifted to the nearest hospital. Prayers for her and her family. Anyhow, We still had two mountains to climb. We kept passing the same former through hiker in a yellow shirt who told us about wildcat mountain and chatting with him. When we stopped he would pass us but then we would catch up and pass him at his stops. We finally got to the top of a mountain where the cheese factory camp site was and took a long rest. We laid on the ground in the shade for a bit and then Mike went to get water while I built a little house out of twigs on the ground. I misunderstood where we were and how much further we had to go, so when yellow shirt guy passed us and said only another three miles, I was shocked. It made me feel like I worked so hard for so long and wasn't at the place I was so proud to be at. I begrudgingly stomped down this large mountain and back up another until we got to tray mountain shelter. We set up camp and saw our new friend comet come up the trail. We had dinner with her and set in for the night.","low gap shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528857,"Day 8- April 19, 2016We woke up at tray mountain at about 6:45 and got out by 7:45. Our quickest pack up and go yet. Our knees and the bottom of our feet felt sore so we needed to take it easy. We started out slow as we wound our way down the mountain. Because of the wear on our knees, we decided we would hitch into the town of Hiawassee for a resupply and possibly a zero day tomorrow. It was an 11 mile journey to were we could get picked up at a road. The day wasn't too difficult, there was one tough climb and one never ending decent. After we had been walking down for about 45 minutes, I told Mike it felt like the mountain just goes on forever. Not long after, we saw a woman going up the trail. She looked so exhausted as she wearily said to us that it just keeps going and she wasn't sure the top would ever come. After passing her we realized that the mountain did just continue to slope down. After about another 30 minutes or so, we got to a water spring so we sat down to fill up our water bladders. Comet showed up and sat down with us. Then two more people came down the mountain. We met Josh and Ali, a very young couple in their first year of marriage. They were very nice and we all chatted for a bit. Oh, and I found a salamander in the creek by the water source. It was neat. Mike called a place called Budget Inn to see if we could get a motel in town and it so happens that they also had one last free shuttle that could pick us up at 3. We were only a mile form the road and it was about 1:45. For the rest of that mile to the road, we continued downward. When we came to the road, there were two women set up with a table of snacks. Trail magic. We were excited to get over there. One of the ladies husband had through hiked the AT before he passed and as a ministry, her church from South Carolina do trail magic each year. It was cool hearing her stories and talking with the other hikers. Because we were waiting for a shuttle, we stayed longer than the trail magic ladies were going to be there for. They gave us tons of food to take with us as they packed up to go. Once they were gone, a girl name Chardonnay came across our path. She had just missed the trail magic by about 15 minutes so we gave her some of what we got. While chatting, we found out she had hiked the PCT last year and is going for the triple crown. A former through hiker drove up and chatted with us and Sipher showed up a swell. The shuttle arrived to pick us up and we loaded in. There were four other hikers who we had seen at Low gap getting dropped off at a different point. We was a fun drive up to Top of Georgia for one of the guys to get a mail drop. From the van we saw that Alex 2.0 was up there. We continues on to the budget inn and got checked in. Once there, we laid on the floor for a good while just being happy to have a rest. Then we showered up and took inventory of our food. We went to Daniels steakhouse for a fried chicken buffet that was only 8$/person, recommended by one of the hikers on the shuttle. It was pretty good, very filling, and very hospitable to hikers. After, we stopped by a grocery store and saw two other through hikers, Michael and Zach. They walked back with us to the budget inn to get rooms. When we got back, we saw Gandalf the Green and Brooklyn! They took a zero for her birthday so we will most likely be hiking with then again. We were happy to see them again! Once we got back in, we did our laundry the cheap way. Filled up the bathtub a bit, sprinkled detergent and Mike churned the slaty dirty pile of clothes with his feet. We rinsed it a few times until it didn't run so brown, then rung them out to dry. We stayed up late watching a basic cable game show called Separation Anxiety, then went to bed.","tray mountain shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528983,"Dregs here,Today was a nice day of rest in Hiawassee. We woke up at about 8am which is about an hour and a half later than we would on trail. We walked next door to the subway and got footlong subs for breakfast and we saved the rest for lunch. After that we walked to a grocery store and sat and had coffee for over an hour. We bought supplies for the next week and walked back to the budget inn we currently call home. The afternoon only got better. We sat outside enjoying the nice day from chairs for once. While we relaxed we met buck thirty from San Diego and he sat and talked for a while. His trail friend who soon became our trail friend Fast Forward came over to talk as well. This is when Melissa found out that Unicoi Gap (road crossing we where we got trail magic)was not unicorn gap....Everyone went their separate ways for dinner. We are staying in and eating trail food as we are a bit over budget for the week. Most of that is from gear replacement......Melissa needs a new hip belt for her pack as she can't tighten hers any farther. We bought one and it will be shipped to us about 5 days up the trail.The rest of the evening was quiet and restful. Hopefully the rest was good for our knees feet. The shuttle for the trail leaves at 9 am.

A light outside of the window tricked me into thinking it was the morning all night long. But otherwise I had a great night sleep. We were trying to catch a shuttle back to Dicks creek gap to start hiking again at 9am. The stay at the inn was everything I hoped a 45$ motel would be. Slightly dank, leaky faucet, blankets that smell like sneezes, and some interesting colors on the maroon carpet; but a flat bed with a good pillow, basic cable, and a shower. As well as many other hiker friends. While on our zero day, Mike was trying to find a basketball game on tv and we happen to watch Big Bang Theory for the first time. As it turns out, we now plan to binge watch the series when wifi is available to us... Anyhow, we got out for our 9am shuttle back to the trail and talked to a few other hikers for a bit. We were informed that about 20 miles away from us up the trail, wild fires had closed the trail. Also, about 12 miles of Shenandoah have been shut down due to wildfires. Hopefully it will rain tomorrow or over night to put out the fires. We got in the shuttle and got back to the trail. It was an 11 mile hike to the shelter, 8 miles to NC and 3 more to camp. The first 8 miles weren't too bad but the last stretch was steep and long. Starting out, I had some foot issues. Looks like the start of planter fasciitis but Mike has it and knows how to manage it. After lunch at the GA/NC border, I was still hungry and tired so we out in headphones and powered up the mountain. Queen, Billy idol, Steve vai, and the Pocahontas soundtrack got me to the top. Mike was was super encouraging the whole way as I was fairly moody. He's been the best partner and teammate through this all. Once we got to the muskrat creek shelter, square peg greeted us along with a girl called sunshine. Marty, Cosmo, gains( now ""silent do-good""), and more showed up. There was a dog and about 15 other campers as well. We set up in the shelter, which is scary for me cause of the snoring, but it's suppose to storm tonight. We'll see if I can make it through the night. A fire was made and we have been hanging out around it. Going to bed soon, currently 7:14pm. Hiker midnight it at dark.","Hiawassee GA

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529596,"Day 11- April 22, 2016Today it rained. Hard. We woke up at muskrat creek shelter, shoulder to shoulder with other hikers. A loud few people chatted as the rest of the site was asleep. Eventually we all crawled out of our sleeping bags and into the cold wetness. No one was moving too fast and it was a bit later in the morning than usual to get started. As we got our rain gear on, Mike and I decided to try and wait to see if the rain would let up a bit. It didn't. We started hiking and got drenched before we even hit the trail. Mike was in good spirits but due to other complications, I was not feeling so good. We had a 12 mile day planned to hike but did not make it that far. It felt like the longest 4 miles ever, to me, over very easy terrain. It was slightly slippery and very mushy with some slippery rocks, but fairly flat. We made it to standing Indian shelter to have lunch. There were a few guys trying to air out their tent in the shelter and failing, As well as a couple still sleeping and the couple, josh and Ali, in a near by tent. It was still early in the day, about 11:30. We ate and tried to get warm but it was a losing battle. As other people showed up, we decided to stay until tomorrow so we could get warm and dry. We met some new people and got settled in in the shelter. It stopped raining around 3:30 so we could dry some of our clothes out. As it is now, clouds roll in around us and thunder is brewing at the neighboring mountain. It will rain again tonight but is supposed to be nice tomorrow. Pray for sun.","muskrat creek shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529597,"Day 12- April 23, 2016This morning we woke up at 6:15am and were able to get out on the trail by 7:15. We had a long day planned to make up for our nearo yesterday. 16.2 miles from standing Indian shelter to our destination of long branch shelter. The day was absolutely beautiful, perfect temperature and clear skies. As we set out towards the top of standing Indian mountain, we came across stunning views of the surrounding mountains where clouds below us passed between them. The climb was super easy and gradual making it easy to enjoy the morning. 8 miles in and at about 10:15am, we arrived at the shelter we were aiming for yesterday. There were still people drying their soaked tents and clothes from pressing on in the storm. We ate some trail mix and stretched, then got back out on the trail. Making great time, we continued towards Albert mountain, the tough climb for the day. Though it was short, it was hand over hand climbing up boulders. Along the way were many tunnels of beautiful twisting rhododendron trees. It felt like I was in a fairytale or some woodsy novel setting. The runoff from the rain created waterfalls and running springs along the sides of the trail and crossing it. At one point, Mike needed to do some foot maintenance so we pulled off into another small trail. It opened up to a spectacular view of endless mountains. Closer to Albert mountain, we were pretty high up and we came to a narrow point in the trail where one side was a solid rock face and the other side was a steep cliff with an even grander view. Me, being afraid of heights, got slightly dizzy for a moment before deciding I needed to take some photos. We carefully stepped through the the slippery wet rocks that lined the trail on the cliffs edge to continue on. When we reached the base of Albert mountain, we saw josh and Ali and we all headed up for the climb. There were many steep log steps followed by putting out trekking poles down to climb up boulders all the way to the top. We reached the top where a tall fire tower stood overlooking the best view of the day. This also marks our 100 mile point on the trail! I can't believe we've gone over 100 miles already! Mike climbed to the top of the tower but I could only get to the second tier of the steps. The rickety old metal swayed in the wind and the height was terrifying to me. A friend named hazel who was already there for lunch took some pictures for us and we headed down the mountain. The rest of the 3 miles to the shelter were easy gradual downhill. We arrived at about 2:45pm. The water source at the shelter was a stream that had beautiful little coves that looked like how someone would set up a mossy terrarium. We played around in those coves and searched for neat things in the small pools of water. I found multiple newts and a small crayfish! In one of the pools, I was poking around with a stick and moved a leaf which accidentally set the pool into a spiral like a toilet bowl flushing. Water started flowing out but was refilled by new water. It was fun. The rest of the day we ate and set up camp as usual.","standing induan shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529653,"Day 13- April 24, 2016This morning we woke up at about 6:30 and was the first time I was the one who wasn't ready to move. It was hard getting up because I was so warm in my sleeping bag and outside seemed chilly and dark. We eventually got up and moving and left by 8. Today we planned to hike over a section that could possibly be closed due to wild fires. Fortunately, it was not closed and the fires were out due to the rain. The first part of the day had a few challenges going up the mountain between Wallace gap and winding stair gap. At winding stair gap, a guy got out of his Chrysler 300 sedan and asked if we needed a ride to town. Dregs and I weren't intending to resupply here in franklin, but we're both starving and having food conversations beforehand. Dregs has said if anyone offered a ride he would accept, and he did. So we got into this strangers car with our packs. I felt bad to stink up his nice leather seats with my sour stench. He said his name was Joe and he's from Long Island. He shuttles hikers back and forth for a few bucks. It was 10$ round trip to take both of us into town and drop us off at a grocery store. At first he said he would wait for us but then gave Mike his phone number and said he needed to give someone else a ride and would be right back. We took a huge risk and left our packs in his car, expecting him to return shortly. We got all of our resupply items and got rid of packaging, divided the portions up, and even got subway to eat. Joe was still not back. We figured he was just held up somewhere and we would wait a bit longer before calling him. After waiting, Dregs called. No answer. Waited a bit longer. Sent a text. Waited a bit more; left a voice mail. Over an hour went by and we sat on the curb in front of the ingles store. All of our stuff was with some stranger that we couldn't get a hold of and had seemed to abandon us. Finally a call. Right after we put a time limit on when the cops would be called, Joe called us saying he was right around the corner and had no cell service in the area he was driving through. Not 5 minutes later, he pulled up and got us. I was so relieved. Lessons learned about leaving valuables with strangers. But Joe was super nice and a great guy who was caught up in driving some lady hiker to another spot who disagreed with his directions. He felt bad for making us wait but honestly, we are just happy to have gotten a ride, resupply, lunch and our packs wernt stolen. We still had plenty of time to hike the rest of our planned miles as well. We had about 5 miles left to hike but now with an extra 6-7 lbs of food. My back was killing me, but Dregs made conversation a bit to help me take my mind off of the pain. We made up an electrolyte drink too, which gave us instant energy and clarity of mind and finished the day off strong. The shelter was a long steep distance off the trail but when we got there, there was trail magic left for us. Sodas and candy left as nice treats! The shelter was empty, no one else around. We had our pick of the tent sites and opted out of the mouse infested shelter. The site is also the first place we have had cellphone signal in days, so we made a bunch of calls to friends and family. Dinner was had as another hiker named jackrabbit stopped in to chat. He set up his stuff up the trail and came pack less to our shelter. We chatted for a bit and he left. Now it is time to lay back and relax until the sun goes down.","long branch shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529844,"Day 14- April 25, 2016Today we left siler bald shelter around 8. We had a brutal climb from the shelter to the trail that is said to be .3 miles but feels much longer. We had loaded up on Mountain Dew and pop tarts before the climb, which made it easier but still more work than I'd prefer before even hitting the trail. Once we made it up, it was a nice downward slope for a while. The day was full of long ups and downs. We hit one mountain that we climbed for two miles. I also learned today that when we come to a gap, ""gap"" means ""Get your Ass Prepared"" to go up a mountain. Or so says Dregs. That long climb led us to Wayah Bald which is the top of a mountain that has a stone tower where you can see all the surrounding mountains. It was beautiful. We ate lunch, crumbled up tortillas with spoons full of Nutella and peanut butter, and squarepeg showed up. We chatted for a bit and went on with the day. More ups and downs through all sorts of scenery. We passed through a section that looked like a forest fire had devastated it, another part that was wind blown, brown dry areas, and places that had tons of wild flowers. We even went through multiple parts that felt more like a rainforest with mossy trees and little waterfalls with coves that created small ecosystems out of the roots of large trees. Looking at all of the new blooming flowers from the rain helped pass the time and we discovered that NC is covered in poison ivy. We hiked about 12 miles. Finally we got to our camp site where the shelter sat directly on the trail. No one else was there. We went to the tent sites up on a hill and found a spot with the most amazing view. As we claimed our spot, we heard other people approaching. Squarepeg, jack rabbit, diatom and Captain Planet, along with some other guys arrived. We ate dinner and hung out for a bit and had some good laughs. As the sun went down it was neon orange and lit up the sky with beautiful colors. We had some issues with hanging a bear bag, but dregs handled the situation just as bed time rolled around. Now, we are ready for bed and another day of hiking tomorrow.","siler bald shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530019,"Day 15- April 26, 2016Today we set out at 7:15am. It was a humid morning that left our tent drenched but the temperature was nice to hike in. We expected about a 12 mile day, mostly down hill, to the NOC. For some reason, I started out tired and never really picked up my energy level which made the hike tough for me. At one point while going up, I decided I needed some food. I got a pop tart out and started eating it . I was sort of down cause I was so tired and Dregs began to get goofy to make me smile. As I laughed at him, my face full of pop tart, crumbs poofed out of my mouth in dry puffs of air. He attempted to vacuum the crumbs off my face and made me laugh more. He really cheered me up for a bit and we continued on. We got to a vista off a side trail called rocky bald and though it was up a steep boulder that I didn't want to climb, Dregs convinced me to go up it. We saw Diatom there eating breakfast and we continued up to the top. It was a great view and was worth the extra effort. Diatom ended up passing us on the trail... Multiple times, but we saw him again at the top of a viewing tower on Wesser Bald. The last fire tower we came across, I was too scared to go up but this time, Dregs convinced me to face my fears. As I climbed up the stairs of the rickety old metal and wood tower, I could see how high I was going. The stairs were just boards that you could see under which was terrifying. I made it to the top and sat down in the middle of the platform. Both of the guys were happy I made it up and it felt like an accomplishment for me and my fear of heights. The view was awesome. We had a 360degree view of all of the surrounding mountains. While up there and feeling wild, I spotted a medium size rock that someone had brought up. I asked the guys if I could drop it off the tower. They said go for it, but I was scared and hesitant to. I didn't want to hurt anyone if someone were to be down there. There was no one around and we could clearly see that. I got the courage and announced to the non existent people that I was going to drop a rock so watch out. I dropped the rock off the tower and it cracked and the main part of it landed directly on the wall of a rocky for epic as if it belonged there. A perfect landing. The three of us hung out up there for a bit before setting off again. The rest of the trail was down hill and hard on our knees. We made it into NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) around 1:15 and checked into our hotel. The place is much nicer than the budget inn... We got some pulled pork sandwiches for lunch with Captain Planet and jack rabbit, then went over to the outfitter to pick up my new hip belt for my pack. When I ordered my pack from REI, I got the woman's small pack that I wanted but with a men's trim shoulder straps and a men's medium hip belt. Not exactly right... But it fit great until I couldn't tighten the hip belt tight enough to take the weight off my shoulders. So Dregs ordered me a men's small hip belt for a better fit. After, we saw Squarepeg and had some drinks with him and the other guys. We had a good time and I almost got a trail name. Still not sure about the name. Storm. Like from X men. Cause apparently I'm feisty and strong... Like I said, not sure of it. Anyhow, we were able to get showers and laundry done and now we feel great. Tomorrow we go up a mountain. All day.

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530684,"Day 16- April 27,2016This morning we woke up at the nice NOC motel at about 7 am. Our plan was to get out by 10. We started some laundry, cleaned up our packs and drank a few cups of the real brewed coffee from the common room. I miss coffee. We had some time to relax before heading out and got on the trail by 9:45. I have my new hip belt that is comfortable but is almost all the way synched tight and may not allow for me to lose much weight before I have a reoccurring issue. Today was more than 5 miles up a mountain and only 2 miles down. We expected it to be as difficult as it was. We stayed at a pretty slow consistent pace from the beginning which worked out really well. And the calories gained from yesterday's gorge on pulled pork and beer really helped. On the way up the first part of the trail we found a black snake and I was so excited! The first snake sighting! Not 5 minutes later, a small lizard rushed towards us and up a tree. What a great start to the day! The reptiles got me pumped up and excited for the day. It was super humid and we just continued to climb upwards. The hike up was very steep at many points but we continued on. Finally we reached the top and walked flat for a bit. Then it went up again... Eventually, we came to a point where we would gradually go down to the Sassafras shelter. It was still early in the day but was suppose to rain so we got a spot in the shelter. We met a few new people and square peg was there too. We hung out in the shelter and ate dinner. More and more people showed up and the shelter got pretty full. Many of the guys warned against their snoring. I'm terrified of tonight's sleep... I plan on loading up on Benadryl and listening to music while praying for rain to hit the tin roof tonight. Side note- the privy here is the worst I've seen. Poo literally piled inches from the seat. Square peg tried to push it down to make space with a stick...","nantahala outdoor center

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530685,"Day 17- April 28, 2016So last night I didn't sleep... Maybe an hour or two. But the snoring was pretty consistent throughout the night. I tried breathing along with the snores for a few hours but I was still awake. Then I tried music. I played Joni Mitchell ""Carrie"" on repeat for another two hours or so. Better, but I could still hear the snoring in the background. Led zeppelin drowned it out the best and worked for a bit but I found that I was listening to the music rather than sleeping. So I turned off the music and it seemed to be quiet for about 10 minutes. As I was about to fall asleep, it started again.. Oh well. It's what I expected. I guess I fell asleep at some point for about two hours and woke up again. I laid there until 6am when I could wake dregs up. We got up and got out fairly quick and fortunately the weather forecast for the day had changed. Nice sunshine for the next few days! As we were walking we caught up to a few people. We eventually made it to a gap where someone had left some apples at a picnic table. We had an apple with squarepeg, kilometer, and two other guys we keep seeing Casper and fit. We had some caffeine and candy as well in prep for going up a mountain nicknamed jacobs ladder. It is only half a mile long but is so steep you can stand up straight and touch the trail in front of you. Before we started the climb, kilometer gave dregs some marital advice that apply to us and this journey. He's been married for over 40 years and said "" it's gonna get tough but don't be a p**** and keep working through it"". Not super politically correct, but good advice in my opinion. As we went up we could see it was a long scary climb. But we powered up the whole way without stopping. Dregs continued to spout off encouraging words to me the whole way up. Once we got to the top we felt amazing. We saw a small garter snake and continued down to a shelter for lunch. There we met Viking and ninja. The rest of the day we had an easy 6 miles that seemed to stretch on for awhile. We made it into camp at Cable Gap shelter and set up our tent next to our old pal cypher. Mr. Squarepeg was all set up in the shelter along with a section hiker named Scott. Kilometer got in not long after as well as ninja and Viking. Later we made dinner at the shelter with the guys and a newer friend named fun fact joined along with Michael and Fiffal. We sat around talking for a bit and now it is time for bed after a 15.2 mile day on little sleep. Tomorrow we hike into Fontana Village and then to the Smokies.","sassafras shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530686,"Day 18- April 29, 2016This morning we woke up a bit later at around 6:30 but were quick to pack up and go. We only had a 7 mile hike to Fontana village that was mostly down hill. As we started out it seemed as if all we were doing was going up and up. At the top I was already exhausted and ready for a nap. Yesterday's climb must have taken the energy right out of me and one pop tart is not enough breakfast when working that hard. Dregs and I got talking and he ended up spending the next 5 miles telling me the detailed storylines of each character in the latest book of Game of Thrones. I had read the books up until the middle of the last book because they seem to drag on to me and I get bored. But Dregs's synopsis of the remainder of the book was captivating and exciting as we hiked through the woods. Intermittently he would stop the story do we could climb some steep hills but then he would continue. It made the miles fly by. We eventually saw water from Fontana Lake in the distance. As we got closer it seemed to be near and then far and then near again. We made it to the marina and caught a shuttle to the lodge. At the lodge we planed on getting our Smokies permit printed out and then getting food before heading out to the Fontana shelter known as the Fontana Hilton. Unfortunately, the Internet at the lodge was down. They said it would be about 45 minutes to fix so we caught the end of their breakfast. We were the only ones in the restaurant but the food was great! Dregs got a breakfast burrito and I got a three egg omelet with cheese, tomato, and peppers along with hash browns and toast. Yea, I had the better meal... We drank coffee and chilled for a bit. The internet was still broken when we finished so we decided to go to the post office and general store. We saw Squarepeg, Viking and funfact before we left the lodge. Once we got to the general store they said their internet was down too. The whole town in fact. We got a coke and went back to the lodge. There we hung out with Squarepeg and funfact. We all decided to go get lunch at the grille and found other friends there. Cypher was already there, funfact, Squarepeg, Michael ( now outlaw), Fiffal, and kilometer all had lunch with us. There, Michael was given (by dregs) the name Outlaw from his rebellious attitude towards the Smokies and their rules. Also, this is where my trail name was agreed upon. It was decided that I would be Chicken Hawk. You know, from the FogHorn LegHorn cartoon where the little chicken hawk tries to eat FogHorn the whole time even though he is so much bigger than the chicken hawk. This is due to my small size but eagerness to take on things bigger than I, such as my appetite and the fact I am attempting the AT through hike. We had a great time hanging out and then went back to the general store to resupply. There were many hikers at the general store hanging out and picking up packages from the post office. Second shift was there handing out brownies and Nowhere was handing out beer. Ninja was there as well. We resupplied for the 6 days in the Smokies and went back up to the lodge to check on the wifi. Still none. Eventually, Squarepeg took the initiative to call the Smokies Rangers and they were able to fax us our permits! We should have did that hours ago but we had a great time either way. A shuttle took us back to the marina and dregs and I walked quickly the last mile to get to the Fontana Hilton for camp. Once we got there it was packed with other friends of ours. All the people we were with earlier were there as well as Cosmo and rob from Baltimore and his uncle. We set up camp and hung out for a little while before bedtime.","cable gap shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530689,"Day 19- April 30,2016This morning we woke up at 6:30 and got going fairly quickly. We set out around 7:30ish and started towards the Fontana Dam. I was feeling much more tired than usual and was less enthusiastic about this part we've been looking forward to. As we saw the dam the water was low but it still had some awesome views. We looked down the drainage tunnel and it was impressive how large and deep it was. We passed the visitor center and it wasn't until we had gone all the way across that dregs realized we didn't know where to put out smokies permit slips. Dregs was slightly panicked and didn't want to go all the way back and I, in my already tired and moody state, couldn't take the stress. I sat down at a picnic table to let dregs figure out what he wanted to do. He found another hiker who said the permit box was up ahead so we continued on. I was moving slow and frustrated so dregs took the lead. I fell behind and was still upset for no real reason. Dregs tried to cheer me up as we started our 12 mile climb into the smokies but it didn't seem to work. Every 50 feet or so I would feel overwhelmed and feel like I couldn't breath. Dregs made us find a place to sit down and he got out ibuprofen and caffeinated tea powder for me. He said he was going to fix me. I downed the tea and medicine and a few day hikers showed up. We chatted with them and the two guys from the Netherlands, Moe and Tiko, showed up. The day hiker tried to name one of the guys orange peel cause of his shirt and we wanted it to stick. After that we kept pace with the Netherland guys for a bit and I meticulously felt so much better. Apparently I'm pretty reliant on caffeine to function. Hiking the AT is not the place to try to quit drinking coffee. We continued on and found two small snakes along the way. We got to the top of the first major climb where a fire tower sat overlooking the smokies. It was such a tall tower and dregs kept saying that it was safe and frequently used and inspected. We took off our packs at the bottom of the trail that led up to the tower and used our trekking polls to climb the rest of the way. Without a pack, it felt like the polls jet propelled us up. As we got closer I saw that this ""safe"" tower had a rusted out railing that one side that fell completely off... But we climbed it. I only got to the second tier which was high enough and over the tree line and dregs and moe went all the way to the rickety top. They said that the floor seemed to be rotted it but with a new pice of plywood over top. They got down and we continued on our way. It was a log day and we were racing to get a 15 mile day in before expected rain would arrive. We made it to the first shelter that we planed to have lunch at and found Squarepeg, the Netherland guys, a ridge runner, and two other hikers. The ride runner checked our permits and we ate for a bit. Still being time concise, we left not long after. Thunder rolled but no rain showed yet. We got to our last mountain to climb and dregs told me we were almost to our final destination so I picked up speed and got my second wind. 40 minutes later we still weren't there..he exasperated a little about how close we were. But we made it to the shelter. Not 10 minutes later, the first rain happened. We had made it without getting wet! The showers came and went as more and more people showed up. Even funfact eventually showed up and we were super happy to se him. He still set up his hammock out in the rain. Crazy. We all made dinner and hung out. It was only 3:30 when we arrived so we Had a long time to chill out. Dregs let me sit on his feet for a bit to keep me out of the dirt while he gave me a back massage which was super great. It was neat to watch the smoky fog roll in around the shelter and blow through as if we were going through a cloud. Now the storm is picking up with thunder and lightning. Time to wind down even though it's not even 8. Oh snap!! Just now while writing, a bear and her cub walked into camp!!! Then went sniffing around a tent with two people in it right in front of us!! A hiker named jack saw them first and casually said ,""hey, there's a bear"". It was so cool!!! Scary though, they don't seem too scared of people cause the guys were yelling at them and they just looked at us and kept sniffing around. I'm really excited that we saw them!","fontana dam shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530880,"Day 20- May 1, 2016Last night was interesting. Around 1:30am, the bear that we had seen in camp earlier was now in the shelter with us not 10 feet away. I heard a loud banging sound from above me when some other hiker tried to scare away the bear going through our packs that were hanging up. There was about 10 people in the shelter and we all woke up immediately. The bear left the shelter but didn't leave the site. Some of the guys went out into the fog with shovels and made noise tiring to scare it off. The fog was so thick that you couldn't see 5 feet ahead of you and it was pouring rain. One of the guys saw that the bear had chewed up his mint scented camp soap and it had exploded everywhere. About 5 minutes later after all the ruckus, Funfact, who was a bear biologist, came in the shelter from his hammock and announced there was a bear out by him. The bear stuck around for a bit and then left. It wasn't until the morning that I realized the bear had also gotten to my pack and ripped open the side pocket after some pop-tart crumbs. In the process of the bear tearing that up, it also stole my camelback water balder. We searched for the bladder around the shelter and jack eventually found it near the woods. It was covered in bear drool and was missing the mouth piece. I found the mouth piece near my pack and went down to the small creek to wash the bladder and test if it would still holed water. I wasn't able to get all of the drool off but luckily the bear did not puncture it!! We got out on the trail at about 7:40am which was later than expected due to the eventful night. We had a 15 mile day planned that was going to be slightly challenging. As we hiked, it was a bit more than slightly challenging; it was extremely difficult and slow going terrain up steep mountains. Our reward for such hard work going up each mountain was a wall of fog that blocked the amazing views that people travel from all over the country to see. Our first real views of the Smokies were just smokey. We didn't get any real good views throughout the day, but the forest around us was lush and green. On our way up to a shelter where we would have lunch, two large wild turkeys appeared. They stared at us like we caught them doing something suspicious. Cautiously, the walked towards us and around us. Then they hopped back onto the trail and picked up some speed. It was awesome because typically wild turkeys run away from you before you even know they are there. After that cool experience, we kept hiking up to our lunch spot. We were greeted by loads of chipmunks everywhere we looked. They would get really close and run right by us. And they were fat little suckers. It was pretty cool. We had lunch and talked to two girl hikers at the shelter before heading on. The last 6 miles of our day were suppose to be easy but there were still plenty of steep uphill challenges. We met a couple along the second half who were training for iron man and they met back up with us at our destination, Silers bald shelter . We also met guliver at the shelter. He asked if he could take our picture with his travel companion, Jessica. He pulled out a little paper doll in a plastic baggie as her rain jacket. It wasn't until after the weird exchange that he mentioned it was for a YMCA children's group following his through hike. I took some time to sew up my bear-torn side pocket and am quite pleased with my handy work. It gives my pack character. Later, jack, Eli, and funfact joined the party. We all ate dinner and are currently getting ready for bed. Tomorrow is another 15 mile day.","russell field shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531399,"Day 21- May 2, 2016This morning we got up early and decided we wanted to try to hike 15 miles before it was supposed to rain at 12:30pm. That would be 15 miles all together with 4 miles up a mountain to Clingmans dome, which is the highest point in the entire Appalachian trail, and a tough rest of the day through the smokies, in 5 hours... That is hiking a very fast 3 miles per hour up steep mountains. We knew it was a long shot but we doubled up on our instant coffee packets and headed out. For the first hour we literally ran down a mountain. Not just walking quick, but running. It was exhilarating and fun and dangerous, but we felt great. We even booked it up some steep parts as well. After a few miles we stopped at a shelter to use the privy and there we saw a deer grazing around a few people. We approached cautiously as to not scare it until we realized it was so use to people it wasn't concerned with us at all. We were feet away from this beautiful large female deer and it just walked around like we weren't there at all. It was awesome. As we were leaving, we saw a second deer come over and one of them pooped. And that is how we learned that deer poop like dogs. Squatting. Interesting, right? Anyway, we continued on and almost out of nowhere, the ecology of the woods drastically changed from dry brown oaks to full lush pines and moss covered rocks and logs with so many new kinds of greenery. All of a sudden we felt as if we were in the mystical forests of some of our favorite adventure novels. The majesty of the forest distracted us from the continuous uphill that seemed to never end. We finally understood why the smokies are one of the most visited national parks in the country. It was stunning. The forest continued on and we went forever upward to the highest point on the AT. We got to a few views where you could see mountains floating in the distance in a sea of clouds. It was spectacular. We eventually got to Clingmans dome where a tall cement tower with a circular walkway took you to the top for what was hoped to be a great view but instead most of the mountains were covered by fog. It was still beautiful and fun to go up and two ladies were excited to meet ""real thru hikers"". After that we continued onwards with a brisk pace tiring to make our deadline. We stopped to get water at a spring that seemed further than advertised in our guide and then made it to a gap even further than expected as well. Somewhere along our journey today we reached our 200mile marker and have now been in Tennessee also. At the gap, there were many day hikers and tourist and we ended up passing then very quickly as we went up the two mile mountain. I was ready to be at the shelter and we didn't have our phones out for the time so we couldn't see how close to rain time it was. Because of this, I was anxious to make it up the mountain. I got in the zone and raced up faster than I thought I could go. We even passed a few through hikers and made it to the ice water shelter first and without getting rained on. When we checked the time, it was 2:40pm. The rain had held off for us just like we were praying for all day. Over the next few hours , over 16 people poured into the 12 person shelter and at least another 10 tented outside of the shelter. It was the most packed shelter I've ever seen. We met some new people like Maddy, mercury, visor, Pocahontas, and pimp daddy long legs. We also saw some old friends like funfact and Captain Planet. It has been raining hard now for a while and there is sure to be some loud snoring tonight. Benadryl and earplugs will hopefully save me. Good night.","silars bald shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531401,"Day 22- May 3, 2016Dregs woke me up this morning in the shelter at about 6:30am. I took my ear plugs out and the choir of snores filled my ears. Not how I wanted to wake up and I really just wanted to go back to sleep. After about 30 minutes, I crawled out of my sleeping bag and started to get ready for the day. It was gray and wet out with thick fog. Not many people had gotten up yet and the shelter had at least 17-20 people in it and another 6 tents right out front. It was suppose to hold 12 people all together. We headed out hoping for a 13 mile day over easy terrain. The real challenge was going to be the forecast of all day rain. As we started, I tried to avoid stepping in all of the streams of water and squishy mud. It took me about a mile to really realize that I was already soaked and it didn't make a difference if I walked right through or not. My feet were so completely wet that not long after we started I needed to stop and sit on a wet log to tape up both of my feet all the way to prevent blisters that were already forming. Dregs was frustrated with me at first cause he really wanted me to take care of my feet and I felt bad for stopping so frequently at the beginning. He was very patient as he stood in the cold rain for a long time not moving. I also had to tape two toes together so I wouldn't step on them and rip the toenail off. Once I got taped up, we got going again and were able to move much quicker with less pain. We got to an overlook called Charlie's Bunion, which dregs has been looking forward to for as long as we've been planning our hike. It is supposed to be one of the best views the smokies have to offer and when we got there all we saw was a wall of fog. A blinding white wall of fog so thick you couldn't see past the bushes that lined the trail. It was such a disappointment for him and I felt so bad because he had been talking about it for days and here we finally are and there is no view what so ever. Similarly, the whole day was on a ridge line with many great viewing opportunities that we could not see due to the fog. Today we really had to use our silver lining perspective to get through as well as our sense of humor. I began to see the fog as really quite beautiful. It was so dense, vast and blindingly white that I couldn't help but be in awe of it. Each time we passed what would have been an awesome view we would instead gaze at the blinding fog and take it as the great view. I did really enjoy it. We also appreciated the mild terrain with its gradual ups and downs and flats. Dregs also practiced his dad humor with comments such as ""we'll just have to go with the flow"" as we walked down trenches filled with streams of flowing water that poured over rocks like waterfalls. Overall it was a good day with challenges that we had to overcome together. We stopped at a path that went down to a shelter for lunch and as we were eating, a large branch fell off a tree not far from us. The forest was so moist that it's hard to believe any large trees could survive with the water saturation. We eventually made it to the Tri Corner knob shelter where again, we were the first ones to arrive. We read in the trail register that there was an active bear here and stored that information in our minds. While we were setting up, we heard a noise outside of the tarp that covered the front of the shelter. Dregs went over to investigate cautiously and when he looked out he called me over. I peered around the corner and there we saw a very perturbed squirrel standing right in front of us. He stared at us and then started squeaking at us viciously as if we had intruded on his home. He ran up a pole and continued to squeak at us. It was absolutely adorable. We ate first dinner at 2pm which was our first time trying mountain house freeze dried meals. They were great. We were given two of the meals by a lady who I let use my phone charger the night before and she was obviously grateful. More people started to arrive and after awhile we had another full house. We socialized and snaked for awhile before setting in for bed. Tomorrow we may attempt our longest day yet. Pray for a good night sleep with only light snoring.","ice water shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531414,"Day 23- May 4, 2016This morning we woke up to sleet. It's was the coldest morning we have experienced yet and it didn't help that all of our shoes, socks, and pants were wet from yesterday's rain. I got up and spent about 40 minutes taping my feet up so I wouldn't get more blisters from the wetness. We had a fairly slow start but knew we were trying to hike an 18.6 mile day, our longest mileage ever attempted. Once we left we started walking fast to warm us up. It took a long time to even start to get a little warm. The sides of the trail were lined with snow. Yes, snow in May while we were at an elevation of over 5,500 ft. It was cold. But eventually we started to warm up. We caught up with funfact after walking like maniacs for a while and hiked the rest of the day with him. It was really cool hiking with another person and having more conversations going throughout the day. The trail was mostly downhill coming out of the smokies and it was cold so we hiked fast. Probably faster than we've ever gone before. There was a strange climate change when we reached a lower elevation where it seemed to go from winter to a warm bright spring day all of a sudden. We ate lunch at a log and tried some new chicken jerky given to us by two men section hiking and we tended our hurting feet. My toe was getting a blister under the toe nail and it hurt badly. We pressed on and as we went, a small trickle of water along the trail grew and grew into a many leveled beautiful waterfall that was quite large. It stretched on for a while and streamed out along the trail. We had a few crossings of the river it formed which were pretty formidable. The last mile of the day was near the hostel we would stay at, Standing Bear. It was near a road and we could hear the traffic,but the wild flowers and overgrowth of plant life made it feel like when I was a child and I found a path that I wasn't supposed to go down but did anyway. I felt like a child sneaking towards a gingerbread house in a story book or like we were headed to a secret place where adventurers congregated. Anyway, it was neat and fun. The three of us made it to the hostel at about 3:40pm where we found jackrabbit and a few other hikers. The place was quaint and let's just say, interesting. It had porter potties and showers that weren't the cleanest to say the least. It also had a plethora of animals ranging from 5 or so dogs that played with a dead mouse and put rocks on our shoes so that we would play fetch with them, two cats that walked on the clean dishes and waited for the pizzas to cook, and a rooster that climbed trees. It's resupply cabin was neat though. It was based on the honor system where you go in and take what you want and write down the prices and tomorrow when we leave, we will pay for the things we took. It had just about everything we needed too. We ate a pizza and some hot pockets, showered, did laundry by hand, and set up in the bunk room. Dregs also took care of my blister under my toe nail as it looked like the whole toe could pop at any moment. It was very painful, but dregs was able to puncture and drain the blister gently. It looked like my toe completely deflated and felt so much better. Hopefully I don't lose the toenail. I hobbled around for the rest of the evening but I think it will be much better in the morning.","tri corner knob shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531958,"Day 24- May 5, 2016This morning dregs crawled down from his bunk and sat on the bed next to me. I took out my earplugs and he whispered, ""they have an alarm chicken"". I couldn't help but laugh in the quiet bunk house. A rooster had been crowing every ten minutes since 5am. He then whispered, ""someone keeps hitting snooze on the alarm chicken"". It was pretty funny first thing in the morning. We got up late, around 7:30, and began to get ready for another 15 mile day. We still had to check out of the hostel and had the opportunity to make coffee. After dregs made a community pot of coffee, before it was done, a crowd of people began to take cups of the coffee. This caused the plunger in the coffee maker to get stuck and the filter to overflow. The impatient group of people accused dregs of screwing up the coffee which aggravated him a bit because it was their acts that caused the problem. He was slightly bitter for part of the morning, but things got better after a few cups of coffee. We set out with funfact for a day filled with uphill funness. The first part of the day would be 4 miles up a mountain, then a few miles down, up another large mountain and a very steep long climb. As we started up the mountain, I got into a slow but steady pace. With this pace I didn't need to stop or take breaks, just kept my heart rate under control and small steps. We lost funfact to a different pace but were able to meet up with him later at camp. In the first part of the day it started hailing on us. It was cool cause it would bounce off of us and didn't get us wet. As we went on, it began to rain and that was cold. We picked up our pace to stay warm. Later on in the day it began to hail again and we were exited but then it started to worsen into an actual snow storm. Yes, a snow storm in May. It was really neat but we were now soaking wet and freezing cold. A dangerous combination. The storm calmed down and the fog picked up. As we were climbing the steep portion of our day headed to Max Patch, which is a large bald mountain top, the fog got thick and bright like the ridge line in the smokies. Max Patch was another on of the amazing and famous views that dregs was looking forward to but when we got there, our view was again a wall of fog. The denseness of the fog combined with the 360degree empty coverage of it was disorienting and quite ominous. Dregs was disappointed yet again that his chance to see this famous view of surrounding mountains was blocked by fog. The ground was extremely squishy and slippery from the snow and the wind was brutal and cold. We were passed by two other hikers who were going to the same shelter as us. Once we got to the shelter it started pouring rain again. The 6 person shelter was already packed with 10 people so we had to set up the tent. Luckily, we had practiced setting up our tent in a way that let us put the internal part up without getting wet, covered by the rain fly and footprint. We were able to get our tent up and keep it dry. It took a long time for us to warm up after changing into dry clothing, but eventually we got warm. We had dinner and funfact showed up so we hung out with him for a little bit. Once we got into our tent, dregs joked around for a bit making me laugh and snort which I'm sure the other campers could hear. They probably think we are in here having a party... It's been a very physicality challenging day with additional challenges from weather and recovering from a long day yesterday, but we made it and can look back and say it's been a good day.","standing bear hostel

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531959,"Dregs here,We have been in Hot Springs NC for what feels like a week to me. Today is Sunday I think and we arrived at 4pm on Friday. We took our second zero mile day yesterday and it felt great! We will hit the trail this afternoon after we have some lunch at the Hostel. We woke up Friday morning and it was just as cold as it was the night before however it wasn't raining! We still have yet to pack up our tent in the rain but our time for that is surely coming. It took us a long time to get moving but eventually we made it back to the trail. In our shivering morning packing session, Chicken Hawk, Funfact and I decided to hike 18 miles into Hot Springs and stay inside for the night.As far as terrain was concerned it was an easier day than most. It took quite a while for us to warm up. A few miles into the day we ran into some day hikers who informed us that there was some fresh fruit trail magic not to far ahead and also that the forecast for rain had changed to 70 degrees with only a 30 percent chance of rain. Needless to say this news was quite the mood lifter. We stopped for the trail magic and Funfact quickly caught up. We hiked with him for most of the rest of the day. There were some very cold and windy spots on the ridge line before we really descended into town. The descent was very tough on Chicken Hawks toes but she was strong and pushed through knowing we had about a day and a half of rest coming our way. We passed quite a few hikers and strolled into the Laughing Heart Hostel at about 4pm. We found a spot in the bunk room and set up. I hung all the wet stuff out to dry and we had hot showers! This hostel is wonderful, very clean with lots of amenities. They actually provided soap in the showers! As soon as we showered Chicken Hawk, Funfact and I headed into town for some real food. We start some laundry before we left and a nice hiker named Fox agreed to pull it out when it was done. I had an awesome burger and we ran into Marty who joined us while he had his dessert! He is now known as crash due to an accident he had at the Fontana Hilton where he fell of the top bunk. After dinner Crash invited us to the tavern for a beer on him. We walked further into town and had a drink with Crash and Simon and a bunch of other hikers who's names I'm sure I will learn later. We left at 930 because we wanted to be back before the hostel quiet time. We got back and all the lights were on and everyone was just preparing to head out. They were mostly quiet coming in at night but one hiker stumbled in and loudly asked a dark silent room if anyone was sleeping....in the morning we all found out about a police officer giving hikers a really hard time. One hiker was picked up for having an open container, he was arrested and had to pay $2000 bail likely ending his hike. The officer gave a British hiker a bunch of grief for not having his passport on him while he was clearly coming home from the laundromat. Still another hiker was stopped for J walking. Lots of people are upset about it.For our zero day we had an excellent breakfast with friends new and old. I woke up early and let CH sleep. We met Friar Tuck and Reptar and Hi tech. After breakfast we went to the outfitter to get Chicken Hawk some different socks to try and fight the blister problem. We grabbed a package from Chicken Hawks mom at the post office and it was full of goodies! Thanks Mom! After that it was back to the hostel for Rest and relaxation. I did some minor gear cleaning and organization. The plan for the evening was to head back to the outfitter for a shirt for me( mine is itchy) hit the tavern for dinner, dollar general for resupply, hostel to drop it all off, then back out to the hot springs to soak in natural hot mineral water at 10pm. Dinner was excellent with basically the same crowd except for a different guy from the UK that I named The Ambassador . Resupply was low so we will need to check back on the way out of town. The hot springs we very relaxing but very similar to being in a normal hot tub. When we got back everyone was at a camp fire but we were to tired.A good nights sleep was had and we are waiting for a picnic to start soon. I miss the trail. We plan to do 11 miles to the first shelter.","roarig forks shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532226,"Day 27- May 8, 2016Today was quite challenging but started off very good. We woke up nice and late, 8:30am, at the hostel and knew we were staying until at least 12. There was a picnic hosted by the hostel owners and run by the hikers doing work-for-stay. We planed on hiking out after burgers and hotdogs and only doing an 11 mile day to the first shelter. Dregs spent the morning preparing to leave and I spent the morning lounging around avoiding the tasks he wanted me to do. I'm sure I had at least 8 cups of coffee and still didn't want to move. It is mothers day, so dregs and I got to talking to our moms and letting them know how much we appreciate them. And we really do appreciate and love them. Then, we finally were able to grab some food. All of it tasted great. Hamburgers, hot dogs, French toast casserole, egg casserole, coleslaw, chips and some sweet tea. We ate it all, so good. When we were done, we said our goodbyes to our hiker friends and me, dregs, and funfact set off. We hiked down our most traveled part of the trail, that led to town, for the first time with our packs. It was a struggle to make it down the steep steps but felt good to finally use my trekking poles that made me less likely to topple down the steps. As we walked through town we got stares from locals and fond greetings from all the other hikers stoping in. Once we got through the town and onto dirt trail, we caught up with fox. Really nice guy, strange, but really nice. He had just taken his pack off so he could dunk his head in the rushing water of the river running along the trail. He dunked his head right into a rapid and looked refreshed as ever. A few steps later we came across a turtle which was a neat find and a little further up the trail we found a red headed skink. The first two miles of the trail were straight up a mountain and it was sad to see that along the whole trail, all 11 miles we hiked today, all the trees and plant life had been burnt in a wildfire. The tunnels of rhododendron trees were now what dregs called, ""rhodo-dead-friends"". The climb up the mountain was strenuous and our bodies were not use to the hard work after our zero day. It was really hot out and we had a full resupply of 5 days of food. My feet were hurting due to blisters and my ankle swollen, Dregs's back was bothering him and he wasn't feeling great, as well as both of us had very full stomachs and it was already late in the day when we just started our 11 mile hike. Yea, We had some challenges to overcome. We struggled for a while and took it really slow. I changed out of my shoes that were hurting my blisters and put on my crocs. I hiked most of the day in those and it worked out great. Then we came across a south bound through hiker, Mountain Man, who we talked to for a bit. After that we took some ibuprofen and picked up the pace. My left knee began to hurt really bad because I had been favoring it while my blistery right foot was in pain and that was an issue for a bit. Dregs encouraged me all day so that I could keep going while in such pain which made a huge difference for me. But eventually, around 7pm, we made it to the Spring mountain shelter where all the black flies were biting and set up our tent. The three of us had dinner and could finally relax. Hopefully tomorrow we have less struggles.","laughing heart hostel

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532228,"Day 28- May 9, 2016Today was tougher than advertised. I was told yesterday that today's 15 mile hike would be super easy with only one challenging section up a mountain. With that in mind, this morning I was in no hurry to wake up. I didn't get to sleep until about 4am cause I had to pee but didn't want to expend the effort to climb out of my warm sleeping bag, get shoes on, find my headlamp, and go out into the cold dark world to use the restroom. Eventually I did and was able to get some sleep after. In the morning, I didn't want to get up and dregs let me sleep in until about 7:30. Once awake we slowly got ready for our easy day. As dregs was putting away his sleeping bag, the pull string came all the way out of the stuff sac. I couldn't help but laugh as he looked distraught. I fixed the bag for him so that I could justify my laughter. we didn't know our easy day that looked like small ups and downs on the map were a bit more dramatic than led on and the one challenge was extremely steep and long. In addition to that, our easy part after the big climb was a rocky ridge walk that was treacherous in my crocs. Yes, I wore my crocs all day today which was good on my blisters but not so great with getting a solid footing on jagged angled rocks. Before that though, we had a nice lunch at a small shelter with a few other hikers. Our meal consisted of tortillas with peanut butter and Nutella and our breakfast mix ( dry oats, brownie mix, and honey bunches of oats cereal). Delicious. After eating we set out for our big climb. It felt like it would never end but obviously it did. At the top, we had cell service so dregs ordered us warm weather blankets to replace our sleeping bags. Funfact joined us for a good part of the rest of the day. The ridge walk had some beautiful views but it took us probably an hour to go a little over a mile on it. I got to walk by myself for a bit while the guys were off on side trails, which was a nice change of pace for a time. They caught up again quickly and hiked the last few miles. We got into the jerry cabin shelter at about 5pm. We have officially passed the 300mile mark as well. Dinner was made; mountain house lasagna thanks to my mother, which was delicious, and are now getting ready for bed.","spring mountian shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532788,"Day 29- May 10, 2016This morning I did not want to get up, again. It was later, 7:30am, and it was nice and sunny out, but I really didn't want to move. Dregs spent the morning in the tent making me laugh, but I still wouldn't move. For some reason, when he told me to respond to Diana's text about socks by saying ""dobby is a free elf"", I lost it and the other hikers camped near by heard. They commented about it once we were packing up. We were slow to get out of camp but loaded up on caffeine, sugar, ibuprofen, and allergy meds before hand with the goal to hike fast to get past rain. Forecast said rain at 2:30pm. It was 9am when we left and would have to hike a solid 3mph to make our goal. If you didn't know, that's fast for walking. The day looked not too bad on the map, mostly down hill and only one large mountain to climb, but that's what we thought yesterday. We set out and booked it up a steep uphill to start and felt good and energized. At the top of the mountain we decided that music would be a good way to zone out and hike fast for our 15 miles. As it turns out, it was a great idea. The gradual down hill allowed us to almost run down the mountains and we kept a very fast pace the whole time. Again, I was in my crocs to let my blisters heal. And again, it was a good idea. We blazed past a few other hikers and then got passed ourself by Strech, who was actually running down the mountain. We came to a road and lucky day, two women were setting up a trail magic cooler. We ate cookies, chips, soda, and split peas while talking to other hikers that came down. We knew we were on track for our original goal, so we kept it short and continued on. Even more so now, we wanted to make our time goal just to prove we could a this point. As we hiked on, we got to the large climb. It was brutal but we powered up a very steep 2.5 miles, stopping only for a picture of a waterfall. We made it to the hogback ridge shelter at 2:45pm and had no rain yet. We were the first to the shelter but five people had stopped in for lunch. There were two guys, two girls with a dog, and fox. We chatted with them for a bit and then they pressed on. We were able to set up in the shelter before anyone else staying arrived. Bombay arrived and then red dragon and a few other hikers. We met a section hiker named Day Hiker, who through hiked in 98. More people showed up and we ate dinner. The shelter filled up quick and dregs got some extra water for funfact cause we couldn't save him a spot in the shelter. Apparently, the water source was very far away. I wouldn't know cause somehow we have made unintentional roles where I set up the tent and make dinner and dregs gets the water and cleans any dishes. Our system has been working out well. Finally the rain started but it was short lived. I'm still glad we got shelter space so we won't have to pack out a wet tent tomorrow. My knee has been hurting from favoring my left leg while my right foots blisters heal. Both feet have heel blisters that have now been popped and drained and the blister under my toenail has deflated a bit and feels much better. If its raining tomorrow I will wear shoes, otherwise I will wear my crocs one more day to dry out the blisters. Honestly, hiking in my crocs has felt much more comfortable than shoes but I trip a lot more.","jerry cabbin shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532789,"Day 30- May 11, 2016 7:00amOne of the greatest things about the trail is how one instant everything can be going wrong, it could be miserable and rainy, you could be hungry and losing the mental battle, but then all of a sudden, out of nowhere everything flips. All it takes is a ten minute break or a kind gesture from a stranger or the rain to stop and the sun comes out. Currently I am enjoying a rain storm from inside a dry shelter knowing that today I only need to hike 10 miles and I have all day to do it. The thunder is banging like someone hitting a tin roof and all I can do is appreciate my current state of being warm and dry and in no hurry. Just a few changes to this situation and I could be in a dreary state of mind and body. Right now is good. Later could not be, but I know that it only takes an instant for the seemingly never ending struggle to end.4pmThis morning started out rainy with a forecast of rain and zero prospects of getting any shelter space at the next shelter where the other twenty hikers planned to go. We knew this starting out and so dregs was in no hurry to pack up and leave. I , on the other hand, was still anxious to get moving knowing that we could still beat a few people there and get an ok camp site. We didn't leave until 10:30am and it was raining hard all morning. As we climbed the first large hill, a man was walking towards us with a strange box. As we met, he asked us if we were through hikers and opened a large box of dunkin doughnuts! The three of us, dregs, funfact, and myself grabbed fritters and doughnuts and a few bananas. It was a really nice treat seeing as how we were in for a cold wet day uphill. After about a mile of hiking, the rain seemed to slow and then stop. I was getting hot in my rain jacket and was also struggling with my hat and water bladder so we stopped so I could get situated. We started hiking again and almost immediately we heard a crack of thunder and it began to pour rain. There was no time, I was drenched. I was cold and frustrated and not looking forward to our camp situation later. As we hiked on I got so cold I had to put my wet rain jacket on to warm the water between me and it. We kept going and I began to accept my discomfort. The rain slowed and it became a little more pleasant. A large climb came up that would lead to Big Bald and it was a challenging climb in the wet slippery mud. About half way up we saw a cooler set up under a tree. I figured it would be empty because of all the people who left the shelter before us and the fact that all coolers so far have been empty. We opened it up and to our delight there was tons of cookies, a gallon of milk, hard boiled eggs and apples. The cup of milk was so incredibly creamy, cold and fresh. The cookies were soft homemade peanut butter and the eggs were delightful. Second trail magic of the day and this rough morning was starting to really turn around. But my feet still hurt and were soggy and it was going to be a rough cold evening setting up a tent and very possibly getting rained on for the rest of the night. We made it to the top of Big Bald and the 360 view was stunning. We were surrounded by mountains with clouds drifting between them. Best view yet. We got some pictures and headed off, only 1 more mile to the shelter that should be packed. Walking down that last hill was tough because the mud was thick and slippery. All of a sudden I hear a thud! I turned around and funfact was on the ground. Hilarious. Third round of trail magic. We all had a good laugh and continued on. The path to the shelter appeared quickly and the rain had stopped. The sun came out and we walked cautiously to the shelter. I couldn't hear anything and didn't see any sign of people. We got to the shelter and peaked in. Empty. First ones there, incredibly. It was almost 4pm and no one had stopped in to this shelter that so many people had planned on staying at. I guess they pressed on with the good change in weather. Either way, I was so excited. It was a big shelter with individual sections for each sleeper and two levels. The shelter was ours, the sun was out, we had two rounds of trail magic, and my feet were able to dry out with no additional damage from the rain. We had a mini cigar before dinner that we have been carrying from hot springs and then ate dinner with other hikers who showed up. Later another hiker came in and had a few strawberries to share, which was delightful as well. This day really turned around from rainy and rough to extremely pleasant. God has really taken care of us and has been faithful in teaching me to rely on him and trust him. This morning I wrote down a thought that was given to me by him and He followed it up with a direct example showing his love.","hogback ridge shelter

But I'll get to that in a bit. I'll start with the uneventful morning where we woke up early and got on the trail. We planned on another 10 mile day as we stalled for getting packages in town tomorrow. It was mostly down hill and quite pleasant. The only tough part was a really steep hill that we powered up and a not so bad mountain that looked worse than it was. That mountain was cool because a waterfall followed most of the trail and had neat pools at each level. Dregs made silly jokes to motivate me such as "" the ferns say you're doing a fern job!"" Those jokes make my day sometimes. We were getting close to the shelter and looking for the water source that was suppose to be .3 away from the shelter down a steepish hill. The shelter had no other water source so dregs wanted to get 5L of water to carry up. We passed a few springs that seemed to be listed on the map before the main one and then got to a small waterfall/spring that looked to be the source we wanted. Dregs filled up the water and we began to hike, only .3miles to go. Or so we thought. The trail kept going and going and then we came to the marked spring for the shelter... dregs was carrying so much extra weight for about a mile and a half. Then we went uphill. Finally we made it to the No Business Knob shelter that had no easy water and no privy. Only 12:30 and we were the only ones there. We set up and red dragon showed up, then Daria and and the South African guy with difficult name arrived.Two others showed up and then funfact. Not long after, a guy I won't name, came up and said he had killed a rattle snake that was on the trail. He chopped its head off and planned to cook and eat it because he killed it. He truly believes he was saving someone else's life by killing it rather than going around. Some people at the camp had very strong feelings about him killing it which is understandable. But he went back down to the stream far from camp and dressed the snake and cleaned it up to bring back to cook on the campfire. Ironically, this guy was supposed to go to the vegan festival today until his snake ordeal. Anyways, Dregs wanted this guy to be cool with us cause he would be sleeping next to us tonight...so he helped him build the fire and gather wood for the cooking. The guy cut up chunks of the snake and began to roar it over the fire. He used our tony chachere's Cajun seasoning to flavor it. The guys boiled it for a long time and we all hung out until it was done and we all tried a little meat.","bald mountian shelter

We got up around 7:30 and it was still raining. Last nights storm was pretty intense. The three of us, me , dregs and funfact, slowly got packed up, in no hurry to be in the cold rain, and got ready to leave. As we started walking, the rain dwindled down to nothing. The rain stopped completely and the sun came out. It was supposed to be all down hill but instead it seemed to roller coaster up and down small mountains for the first few miles, then it turned into never ending switchbacks all the way to town. We walked into town and continued down a road that no cars passed down for a log while. We were getting concerned we would have to walk the extra few miles but eventually we got picked up by an old couple with a boxer dog. They told us to hop into the bed of their truck and drove us to a pizza buffet. It wasn't the fanciest place but we ate a lot. We needed to get to our super 8 motel 5 miles away after the pizza so Dregs causally asked locals in pizza place who were talking to us where we could hitch at to get to the super8. They offered us a ride there. We rode in the bed of truck to motel and checked in. Dregs had discovered that one of his trekking poles was broken so he called Black Diamond who makes his poles and they are sending him a new pair. In the meantime he only has one pole. Dregs has also been having shin pain which could be shin splints and a possible hike ender of it gets too bad. My feet have been itching really bad. It looks like tons of bug bites but is blistering in some places which could mean poison ivy. In addition to all of that we needed to sort out some credit card issues that we were unaware of because we have been on the trail and not receiving mail. Dregs got that all situated and we walked over to Walgreens for anti itch cream for my feet and a leg wrap for his shin. Then we went to the post office and picked up two packages we have been excited for. One was our new blankets for warmer weather to replace our 15 degree bags and the other was from our church, Living Stones. They had sent us Kind Bars which we have been looking forward to. First time trying the maple flavor and they are fantastic! We went back to get funfact and then the three of us walked a few miles to get a texmex diner. On the way there, we saw a quail in someone's front yard running around, I was excited to see it. At dinner, we all got fajitas and it was super good. Afterward, we walked over to resupply at food lion. It was going to be a long walk back to the motel and it was getting late but then a man pulled up to us in car and offered us a ride back to motel. We got back and sorted our foods for the week. My feet are still unbearably itchy but hopefully the swelling and itch will go down by tomorrow. Ibuprofen, Benadryl, hydrocortisone lotion and bed. Looks like Big Bang Theory is on again. That should take my mind off my feet until I can fall asleep.","No Business shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533199,"Day 33- May 14, 2016Dregs here,We woke up this morning in our Super 8 motel room and headed down for free breakfast. My leg was still hurting and all of my research points to shin splints. I have heard of people able to continue hiking with this injury and sometimes it even gets better. I spent most of last evening trying to figure out how I could be one of those people. It seems that because of where it hurts and that it only hurts on downhill steps, that the cause is the way my foot lands or high impact on down hills. My plan for the day is to adjust my gait so that I don't walk with the weight leaning on the outside of my feet and also to land toe first on down hills. Plus lots of stretching.Breakfast was ok but also plentiful so we took our time. Funfact headed up early to pack up as he is headed Johnson city to rent a car. He was planning on hitching a ride and needed to get there by 12 before the rental place closes. He is leaving the trail for 4 days for a planned family thing. Sadly it does likely mean not seeing him again for a long time or forever. Very sad day.As we packed up our stuff the itchiness on Chicken Hawks feet began to let up. I guess that means it's not poison ivy thankfully. Check out time was 11am and we were only planning on going 12 miles so we were not rushing at all. I got a text from Funfact stating that he had gotten to Johnson City and had his rental car. He was offering to pick us up and take us to the trail. We of course accepted and rushed to get ready. He was coming in to get us as we were headed out to wait for him. It was nice not to have to hitch hike but even nicer to see our buddy one last time.He dropped us off and we headed back into the woods. As always it felt like going home again. We waved as Funfact drove away and started a 6 hour drive. The first couple of miles were very easy and a good place to practice my new hiking strides. I was using Chicken Hawks trekking poles so I could have a full set with my injury. That left her with just one and she doesn't like the scratchiness of mine. So then I had one of mine and one of hers, it was odd have 2 different trekking poles. It gave me the idea that if we found a good stick then she could have both of hers back and I would be in basically the same situation. I prayed for the perfect stick and told Chicken Hawk to keep an eye out. Minutes later she found literally the perfect stick. It's the right height and even has handle. I spent the rest of the day focusing on my steps and stride and praying for help in finding a solution to my shin problem. Time will tell if my changes will help. We hiked slower than usual because of me but I felt I could go on much farther. About half way through the day Chicken Hawk got really excited and yelled ""Look at the Bloom-a-dendron!"" Sure enough there was a beautiful pinkish purple bloom on a rhododendron bush just ahead. From one day to the next the blooming had started. It was very exciting to see and we can't wait to see when they are all in bloom.We crossed a very cool high mountain bald called beauty spot and the cold wind started whipping. We got down to the place where we planned to camp and found no level area for our tent. I had to make some adjustments to the leaves on the ground to create some flat land for ourselves. In the end it worked well enough. We are currently nestled in our tent getting ready for bed on what seems like it will be one of the coldest nights so far.","super 8 Erwin, TN

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533963,"Day 34- May 15, 2016This morning we woke up to brutal wind, fierce cold and my mouthpiece to my water bag chewed up by mice. We had decided to wake up late in hopes of it warming up a bit, but by the time we left at 10:45am, it was still freezing. Our first bit of the day was right up a mountain which got the blood flowing but didn't quite warm me up completely. Dregs had his base layer on but I was sure it would be too warm for it soon. It never really got warmer and I never gave in to putting on a warmer layer. The day was fairly uneventful. Dregs focused on his stride to help with his leg pain and I decided to listen to an audiobook, Mistborn. The day was full of climbs but it didn't seem too tough. We kept flip flopping with another hiker, bubble head, who we've seen a lot for the last few days. Eventually we made it to the shelter and set up camp. We made dinner and finally after 34 days, our fuel canister that we started the trail with ran out of fuel. It lasted much longer than expected as we made dinner every night with it. Many of our more recent friends showed up to the shelter, Bombay, wallet, blue sky, and bubble head. From there we just settled in for another cold night. It's supposed to be the last really cold night for a while, but we'll see about that. Tomorrow should be a bit warmer.","camp site

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533958,"Day 35- May 16, 2016Dregs here,Today was another good day. We woke up in our tent at 615 am and got ready and packed up by 715. It was warmer but still cold and we were happy to be back to waking up early. The day started with a small up and down before starting the big climb of the day, Roan mountain.The climb was gradual and long but the terrain was beautiful and varied. The higher we got the prettier it was. There were no open vistas but the trees slowly changed to pines and then very little pines. It got colder and mossier the higher we got. We saw lots of ice and icicles in mid May in the south. We got to the top at over 6000 feet and there were no views other then the terrain. The path became noticeably rockier and harder to walk on. Not to much later we passed the highest shelter on the AT. We didn't stop but pressed on hoping for a warmer place for our lunch. The trail descended and continued to greener. It was almost like being in the smokies again. We got to a road at Carvers Gap and climbed on to an open sunny bald. We sat on the grass with great open views of the surrounding mountains and had a satisfying lunch. As we sat a college class with packs on headed past us up the trail. There were enough of them that we were afraid the shelter might fill up. We hurried past them and enjoyed an open expanse of mountains all around. From there there was a steady down hill. My legs started to tire because I'm still trying to adjust the way I walk to try to alleviate my shin splints. I have seen steady improvement over the past 3 days so far. We arrived at the famed Over Mountain Shelter at about 2pm, we were the first ones here. It is an old barn converted into a shelter that says it sleeps 20. It could likely sleep 40. Lots of new thru hikers as well as some of the ones we have been seeing like Bombay, Wallet, Blue Sky, and Bubble Head are here. There is also a bunch of section hikers and the college class is tented out. It should be raining by morning so it could get crowded.Chicken Hawk is headed to bed early as we want to wake up at 6 again. We resupply tomorrow and possibly hitch hike to a restaurant. After just less than 10 miles. We would then hitch back and find a camp site. It is supposed to rain all day. We did 15.6 today and the terrain ahead looks like it is getting easier for a while. Let's hope.","unnamed camp site

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533961,"Day 36- May 17, 2016Dregs here, Last night we went to bed with at least 20 hikers spread out all over the top floor of the Over Mountain Shelter. At the very last moment before bed a hiker came up to me as I lay in my sleeping bag and asked if she could set up next to me. I said absolutely and heard a friendly reply ""Dregs is that you?"" It was Kate from the smokies and hot springs! I felt bad for her because of her late arrival knowing I would rise at 6am.The morning was cold and we could hear rain falling gently on the tin roof of the old barn. We packed up as quickly and quietly as we could. Everyone was sleeping upstairs where it was warm so I whispered to Chicken Hawk that we should move our stuff downstairs before packing up. She nodded in agreement seeing that it would be really considerate to all of the nice still slumbering people. She then almost immediately dropped her food bag containing a backpacking cook set (like a pot wit a fuel canister inside). I could barely contain my laughter so I hurried the rest of the way down the precariously steep ladder. This shelter had a privy (moldering toilet) but it was small, the front was open, and there was no roof. I was excited to use it because there are none in Tennessee and this would be our last day along the NC TN border. I had the unique experience of sitting on a toilet while getting rained on. It was much overshadowed by the strangeness of a couple of hikers who had set up their hammocks with a view of the open front of the privy. They were presumably asleep and I really wasn't too concerned with the alternative however Chicken Hawk was a bit more bothered by it. I was chatty as usual this morning and we didn't head out until about 735. The rain soft but unmistakably present. We left the shelter and immediately began a steep climb up to an open bald. These balds are treeless mountain sides or summits that usually offer excellent views or at least the novelty of not being chokingly surrounded by trees and underbrush. On cold rainy windy days they offer self doubt and paranoia about hypothermia. Today wasn't so bad, it was not scary cold but we were hit with sideways rain as the wind fought to add itself to the list of delightful challenges we faced this morning. The trail ducked back into the trees but we knew there was at least another small bald that was visible from the shelter. We ascended another 500 feet and it got a little colder as the next bald came in sightn.The first bald was called Little Hump Mountain. The next hour or so was spent traversing Hump mountain. It was breath taking in more ways than one. It was cold, wet, slippery, and extremely windy. But so perfect and awe inspiring. We went up the first peak and saw down across a valley up a much higher peak. The clouds and fog obscured some things but not the brown line of muddy trail snaking its way up over the highest summit on hump mountain. The trail cuts back into the woods and for a second it seemed like we weren't headed for the daunting climb. The trail looped back around and we began our ascent. The climbs aren't as tough as they used to be, up is only slightly harder than flat these days. It's still more work to climb a mountain but much smaller climbs used to tire is out and require breaks or a super slow pace. We just walked up and up. We believe our trail legs are beginning to truly set in. We reached the summit of the tall bald mountain and saw that it continued up just as far as we had already come. It's truly amazing how much mountain can hide behind a false summit. With every step the wind, cold and austere beauty increased. The clouds formed pools in the valleys and were swept up at the edges where the wind whisked them away. We headed down and back into the trees for a 4 mile descent into resupply point. On the descent I was so caught up in reliving the majesty of the mornings scenery I had my first real fall. Slippery roots....It hurt but there was no damage.Our resupply was at the general store of Bed and Breakfast/ Hostel called Mountain Harbor. It was 0.3 down a busy road to get there. We had to wait for them to open the store but we met a few new hikers on the porch. Phase one of the plan was completed when they opened up and we got 2 days of food. Phase 2 was too hitch hike 3.6 miles to a restaurant named Bobs Dairyland. It was recommended by a local who was section hiking and stayed at the shelter last night. Kate showed up and we invited her to lunch. We walked to the road and Chicken Hawk stuck out the magic thumb and after 3 cars a white pick up stopped and we were on our way. The nice man left us in the parking lot of our lunch spot and we headed in. Some hungry looking locals walked in behind us and I asked him for his recommendation. With desire in his eyes he said ""The club sandwich is the best thing on the menu"" When it was our turn Chicken Hawk and I confidently ordered 2 club sandwich combos. My mouth is literally watering as I write this. They were as advertised. Afterwards we needed milkshakes to recover our senses.The hitch back took longer but a young guy in a nice SUV picked the 3 of us up and delivered us to the trail. Kate headed back to the hostel and we headed up the trail. Phase 3 was to find a spot not at a shelter a few miles in and have a quiet night hopefully before the rain started back up. I am happy to report all 3 phases were successful. Today was a good day. More rain in the forecast for tomorrow but we just may stay optimistic anyhow.","over mountian shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533964,"Day37- May 18, 2016This morning we woke up at about 6am to another alarm chicken in the distance from our secluded camp spot. It was great to not have a ton of people around us for once and was rejuvenating for me as an introvert. Dregs was getting packed up to hit the trail while I went to use the bathroom (tree) when I hear dregs say loudly, ""we have friends!"" Through the bushes I could see a big brown dog sniffing around dregs and I got excited. Then, a medium sized older black dog came around the corner to me and sniffed around. I put my hand out for him to sniff and he came over. I pet the sweet old dog and he seemed pleased. He then walked over to a tree near me and peed and then promptly walked off with the brown dog. Neither had collars and were roaming the forest. We have heard about wild dogs around these parts and may have just met some friendly ones. Or they are runaways, who knows. But it was awesome! About 20 minutes later another stray yellow lab type dog came near camp but walked away when it noticed us. We got out on the trail finally at about 7:45 expecting rain at some point today. Our hike was pleasant and not too difficult. We had 14.6 miles to our next shelter we wanted to stay at. Dregs set the pace so that he could walk a good speed to take care of his leg but ended up hiking probably faster than I would have. A part of the trail went past a beautiful river that looked perfect for fishing and passed a camp site that the guys we met yesterday, blister, trout, and voodoo, were still at. We also took a side trail to an awesome waterfall. By 1:15pm we arrived at the shelter destination. We were surprised that we had gotten there so quickly but decided to stay the night. We sat down for lunch and continued to eat everything we could spare. By then, a few section hikers and blister had arrived. We talked to them for a bit and felt a little more energized. With that, we decided that we should press on and hike another 6.7 miles to the Kincora hostel. That would make it our first day over 20 miles at 21.5 miles today. We also hit the 400mile marker early on in the day. Once we decided to do the extra stretch, I was too lazy to put my shoes back on so I hiked in my crocs again. While the first half on the day was full of mud, A lot of that second half had burnt forest from wild fires. Dregs and I decided to listen to our audiobooks for a while until it started to lightly rain. That didn't last long and we were almost to our destination when suddenly I see dregs slip on a wet root in front of me. As he fell, he curled forward and hit his head on a rock. I heard the thump and was immediately terrified. He got up, inspected himself and smiled. He was fine. Accept for a small but painful cut on his finger. It was scary and could have been much worse but thankfully it wasn't. He will be getting new trekking poles very soon so things like that will be less likely to happen. We reached the road to the hostel   at about 4:50pm and walked over. Surprisingly, there was only three people there sitting on the porch. We met Focus, Rest Stop, and the owner of the hostel Bob Peoples. Along with the 5 cats running around. The two hikers showed us around and we got a spot in the tree house. It was a 5$ donation per person to stay and were able to get showers, laundry, and a massive amount of spaghetti and meat sauce leftovers for dinner. It was everything and more than we hoped for. After eating with the other hikers we got ready for bed. The day didn't seem as long as it was with the miles but I'm sure ready to sleep.","camp site

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535091,"Day 38- May 19, 2016This morning we woke up in the Kincora tree house. I didn't sleep well because my muscles hurt and I was cramping. As we got ready to leave, dregs went down to the main house and talked to focus, rest stop, and merlot who were also about to head out. Rest stop and focus left before us and we were sure that we wouldn't see them again. One is a triple crowner and the other is a double triple crowner, someone who has hiked the three major trails twice each. They have been pulling 25-35 mile days. In talking to them, we were inspired to pick up our mileage and do longer days, not faster just longer. We left the hostel and walked with Merlot for a while. We got to know her a little better and learned her son had through hiked already, now she wanted I cross it off her bucket list.The first part of the day led is to laurel falls. It was a large water fall with a large beautiful stream that flowed from it. Following the stream was a rock scramble that we had to climb and was very slippery along river edge. We climbed mostly up for the day. As we were hiking, dregs had service on his phone so he made a few calls and check in at work. While he was on the phone I found our first set of chicken mushrooms. I was super excited but he was slightly distracted on the phone. We left them and continued. It was 8 miles to a road where we hitched into town. At the road there was a sign that clearly whomever posted it was upset. locals have been really upset that the government had forced some of their land to be given up for trail. We got ride into Hampton, TN and was dropped off at a McDonald's. I got 3 burgers and a mcflurry and dregs got three other types of burgers and two pies. It was everything I had hoped it would be. When we were finished and about to walk to the post office, people in a van saw us and offered us a ride. We picked up a box from eric with rain cover, pants and snacks. We were super excited for gummies and sweet strips. Next we went over to grocery store/ hardware store and resupplied. There, we saw the south african guy who's now calling us "" the hobbits"". When we finished shopping, we tried to hitch back to trail but had no takers. A guy in the grocery store parking lot waved us over and gave us a ride back. We got back to the trail where it started at big lake. By the lake we saw wallet and another hiker who had gone swimming. We Hiked on up for another 9 miles while listening to audiobooks. We passed over a large dam with a huge rock face behind it and beautiful lake and mountains on other side. It was pretty neat looking and made me feel so small in comparison. When we got to a spring near our destination, dregs began to fill the water and told me to go on and find camp for the night. I could have just gone 1.7 miles to next shelter but instead I kept going. I found a spot about two miles after the shelter after following purple and orange flowers that lined the trail. The spot was just big enough for our tent to have a nice flat space and a small sitting area. It was about 7pm. This was a long day that in all was about a 19 mile day. I set up camp and dregs showed up not long after. He was proud of me that I kept hiking on. We ate and got ready for bed with a pretty standard rest of the night.","kincora

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535093,"Day 39- May 20,2016Today we woke up at a campsite about two miles from the last shelter. Dregs wanted us to make at least 20 miles today so that we would have an easy day to Damascus, VA tomorrow. We need to get to the post office tomorrow before 10am so that Dregs can finally get his replacement trekking poles. As we were getting ready, I saw break neck quickly hike by. He is the guy who was arrested in hotsprings by some cop who has seemed to be targeting hikers. He said hi and kept up his quick pace. Not long after, Bombay passed our site too. We got hiking by 8am and I felt tired to begin with. My body felt tired from pulling long miles the last few days and was not ready for another long day. To help with the fatigue so early in the day, I put in headphones and went. As we hiked, we passed by the grave site of a hermit who lived in that area of the woods for fourty years. Grave stone was in the ruins of his old stone chimney and it said ""lived alone, suffered alone, died alone"". Pretty depressing. There, a PCT hiker named Pie stopped over to check out the grave and then she passed us. Day had pretty easy terrain. We caught up to Bombay at a road before a farm. The trail passed through a cattle farm and we got to be among all of the cows. Bombay got real close to a calf to get pictures and dregs joked about trying to ride them. As we passed through, we saw one of the cows had both horns and an utter... The three of us hiked together the next three miles to a Shelter where we would have lunch. We saw merlot there and met Pie officially. Wallet showed up after the others had moved on and we talked to him for a bit. He told us of the mouse issues in the last shelter that we passed up. He said that they were everywhere and one even crawled into bombays sleeping bag at night. We finished up lunch and hiked another 8 miles to next shelter. In the forecast it said that it was supposed to rain at 5. We got to the next shelter at 5pm and up to that point had already gone over 21 miles for us that day. Bombay had already arrived and we met a guy named morning wood. He had a funny pink hat with flowers and apparently had some interesting stories. Though it was supposed to rain, we decided we wanted to keep hiking so we would have an easier time getting to town early. Dregs went to get water and I hiked on to find home. I ran into merlot on the way and chatted for a bit before I continued about another 3.5 miles. I found a spot and set up camp quickly to avoid rain. It was about 6:15 and I could see the storm rolling in around us. It was extremely windy and I had a hard time putting the tents footprint down without it blowing away. Merlot arrived and set up next to us. Not long after, Dregs showed up and we ate dinner and got in the tent as the rain started. It violently rained for a few hours while the wind pounded the tent. We were lucky we had gotten ready and in the tent before the storm started though dregs got a little wet coming back from hanging the food bags. Today turned out quite well as it was our first day doing about 26 or 27 miles and avoiding the major thunderstorm. Damascus tomorrow, and finally in VA. What an accomplishment. It's pretty exciting we have gotten this far and it has been such an awesome journey. Each day we get stronger and braver and keep overcoming the many challenges put ahead of us. I can't wait to see what VA has in store for us.","camp site

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535094,"Day 40- May 21, 2016Dregs here, We woke up to a very light rain which was a pleasant change from the night before but still not the most encouraging thing in the world. We knew we were about 5-8 miles from town and all of the good things that go with it so it was easy to get motivated once we actually woke up. We got moving and we were ready by 745. Merlot was friendly as always so we chatted a bit longer than we should have. Our goal was to get to the post office to send home half of our cold weather gear. It closed at 11am so the race was on.The terrain was some of the easiest we have had yet but the tread way was still difficult because of all the rain. On the down hills we got what I refer to as bonus distance. Every downward step came with a little or not so little slide. Thankfully it was basically all down hill because bonus distance works in reverse on the uphills. About half way through our morning we came to a sign at the intersection of a couple of trails. As I got closer I got excited when I could start to see what it said. It was the sign declaring that we were done with our third state and onto our fourth. We made it into Virginia! After some selfies and picture taking we moved on. Not to long after it stopped raining. As we made our final descent into town it became clear that not only would we get to the post office in time but we would also be able to check into a hostel first and set our stuff down. We walked down the final switch back and beside a log cabin into a clearing. The trail followed a short residential street and then turned to the left ant there was the welcome to Damascus sign. A nice stranger offered to take a picture of us there!We walked a quarter mile down the road to Woodchucks hostel and were sad to hear the two person cabin was full. He offered us a tent on a platform with cots in it and breakfast for $30. There was also plenty of room inside but the tent option sounded quieter. We quickly pulled out what we wanted to send home and headed for the post office. Right before the road to the post office I saw the outfitter that was supposed to have my warranty replacement trekking poles. I wanted to stop there first to grab my new poles so I could mail my one good pole home with the rest of our stuff. They were there! Thanks Black Diamond! We made it to the post office with time to spare and sent our boxes home. What a relief, we could relax.As we pondered what to do next Pie and Focus waved to us from across the street. After chatting with them and Merlot for a while I saw the pizza place across the street turn its open sign on. We made our way over to an establishment called Bobo MacFarlands. I got a small child sized calzone and to be honest the next few hours are kind of fuzzy in my memory. Chicken Hawk got something healthier. We walked back to the hostel after that to clean up our aching bodies and muddy wet gear. Tent and other gear got hung on the clotheslines and we had our showers. Showers might be my favorite part of town stops. We did a load of laundry, put our dry gear away and planned the rest of the day. As we waited for our laundry to be done a scary looking storm began to roll in. Everyone thought we were crazy for going out in it. We needed to buy a few things from the outfitters in town. I got a smaller water bladder, chicken hawk got a replacement for her broken hip pouch. We went to a gym/running store and got a compression sleeve for my healing shin splints. Next stop was to a place called Hey Joes for burritos. While we had dinner the storm came down hard. Water started to flood in the side door and the staff of the restaurant had to all work fast and hard to keep the water at bay. The food was great and the storm stopped. We walked back to the dollar general to resupply. They had also been flooded by the downpour. We grabbed 4 1/2 days of food and headed back to the hostel. We spent the evening hanging out with Bombay, Blue Sky, Wallet, and lots of new faces. There was snorlax and music box with their dog stalker. A guy named heavy D who openly admitted he wasn't a nice guy and wasn't on the trail to make friends. He hiked out and then it started to rain hard not to long after. There was Cheesus and Two Step and also Smalls and Lt Dan. It was a good night with lots more food. Chicken Hawk went to bed early and I stayed up late watching basketball on Blue Sky's phone. Not a bad day at all with an easy one planned for tomorrow.","before VA

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535095,"Day 41- May 22, 2016This morning I tossed and turned on the squeaky cot in our huge tent at the hostel. It was 6am and I checked my phone for the time. I did not need to be awake this early but there I was, awake. I looked over at dregs starting to stir as well. I closed my eyes and tried to take in a little more rest before dregs would wake me for breakfast. The woodchuck hostel provided a large breakfast for the hikers between 6-8am and I was sure dregs wouldn't miss that. We both got up not long after and went straight for food. There was a lineup of homemade blueberry waffles and hash browns, hard boiled eggs and chopped bananas. And coffee, amazing hot coffee. I helped myself to two large plates of food and about 5 cups of coffee while enjoying morning conversations with the other hikers around, mogaly, false top, charge, dregs, and Bombay. We hung out for a bit and then dregs disappeared for a while to pack up his stuff. We planned on hiking out and getting some miles in. I found myself playing the role of dregs, talking to friends for hours instead of getting ready to leave. By about 11, dregs informed me we had only a few minutes to remove our stuff from the rented tent so I hurriedly packed up and moved out. We said our goodbyes to the rest who planned on zeroing and headed out. We stopped on our way through town to replace some socks and get some shorts and a tank top from the dollar general. The trail lead through town and we saw some old friends at the outfitter, C sharp, jack rabbit, second shift, and 2.0. We chatted and I had begun to get a headache from not wearing my glasses. Unfortunately I just sent those home seeing as how I haven't worn them in 3 weeks... I took some ibuprofen and felt better soon after. We picked up subway for later and got on the trail. After hiking for a bit we talked to some locals who want to do the trail and then we caught up to a hiker named Goner who we talked to for a bit. We went up a long mountain and caught up to slim and Lt. Dan. They stopped at the shelter at the top of the mountain and we continued on for a little longer. About two miles later I stopped and told dregs I didn't want to hike anymore today. I just didn't feel like hiking for much longer. It was already a 12 mile day and we left late. I wanted to make camp before rain at 8 and be able to relax so we hiked to the next water source a mile further and set up camp not far from there by a pond. We ate our subway dinner which was fantastic and then went for a walk around the lake. We saw a bunch of frogs and one sat on a log and looked the size of a frog shaped grapefruit. Biggest frog ever. We got back from our walk and got into our tent and dregs read the first chapter of the New Testament out loud. He asked if I got anything out of it and I said that I just realized that Jesus is not related to David cause he's on Joseph's side of the family... Anyway, we settled in and the rain began promptly at 8:00. Loud frogs tonight. Better than loud snoring.","woodchuck hostel

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535097,"Day 42- May 23, 2016It was raining when i woke up this morning; 6 am and I couldn't get dregs to wake up. I tried for a few minutes without success so I went back to sleep. I figured he would eventually wake up with the light and then get me up. We weren't in any rush to get anywhere and the rain would make us slow to rise regardless. At about 7, he woke up and I was partially awake. We stayed laying down telling each other it was time to get up for the next 30 minutes. Finally, the rain seemed to slow and we crawled out and got ready to leave. I unfortunately stepped in poo in one of my camp shoes for the second time and grudgingly tried to clean it off for a bit. We packed up and left camp, walking around the small pond we circled yesterday. Then we were off. The hike wasn't too challenging but we had a hefty uphill not too far in. We came to the first shelter where we saw Heavy D, who carries a 65lb pack. We chatted with him for a bit and continued on. At one point, in the rhododendrons, we stopped to put in headphones and get our audio books started until we heard a loud shuffle in the brush beside us. We froze and then dregs told me to keep moving thinking it could be a bear. We then both saw it, a young doe up above us on the hillside. It looked at us and then slowly creeped around and down the hill down to the trail. It froze in the path behind us, glanced back at us for a moment, and then pranced down the trail in the opposite direction from us. It was a really cool moment that almost passed us by. We continued on with excitement from the close encounter and made our way up a large hilly pasture. There, cows grazed up and down the trail. Two calfs stood in the middle of the trail and wouldn't move until we walked up to them. After the cows, we caught back up with Heavy D and passed him. I saw two more deer on our way up a mountain and we passed many south bound section hikers and slack packers. The scenery very much resembled the smokies again with beautiful mossy trees and boulders and many many small waterfalls and springs. It was a rock scramble for a while and the path was more like a small muddy river for the most part. We ate lunch at a tent spot and then once out of the woods, it opened up to a hilly rocky open area. The trail took us through large boulders and we had a rear view of all the mountains around us. It was stunning. We passed the next shelter and decided to keep going. We got to an open field and to our delight, a heard of wild ponies appeared. The trail went right past them and as we approached, two bold ponies came over to us. We had heard that they like to try to lick the salty sweat off of hikers so dregs stuck his hand out to the one we called Fabio, because of his flowing mane. Fabio licked at his hand delightfully and then I put my hand out too, he came over to me and l put my had out as well. It was scary and awesome. I didn't want him to bite us and we didn't want to encourage this behavior too much, but we couldn't resist the friendly pony. We continued on and started looking for a flat campsite. It was hard to find but eventually we found a beautiful spot to set up camp. It was that last site before the Grayson Highlands state park. We could see multiple herds of ponies from our site and have a great view of the surrounding mountains. Dregs gave me a back and foot massage which was wonderful and we set in for the night. I'm excited for tomorrow and seeing more ponies.","pond campsite

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535098,"Day 43- May 24, 2016Dregs here. We woke up in a beautiful campsite just south of Grayson highlands. The tent was completely soaked on the inside. It was actually raining inside the tent when we moved around. We later figured out that we forgot to open the vent windows and that's where all the condensation came from. We packed up on one of the coldest mornings in a while and headed into the Grayson Highlands state park. Our 5500 foot elevation accounted for the cold. We entered the park through a gate and immediately saw wild ponies. They didn't come over to say hi this time but that was ok, we had hiking to do.I was really excited for the park because the land leading up to the border was some of the most beautiful of the trail. The actual park wasn't quite as nice in my opinion as the land surrounding trail just south of the park. It was not the easiest walking despite the relative flatness of the highlands it was covered with rocks and water. There were long stretches where the trail was more like a creek and instead of hiking it was like rock hopping. Later in the day after many fence crossings we came to a stretch of forest that looked more like traditional eastern woodlands. We were on a side hill flat stretch when I heard chicken hawk yell ""bear!"" I was about 50 feet behind and caught up to see a mother bear at the base of a tree with two tiny Cubs. They were cat sized. We quickly kept moving not wanting to scare the young bear family too much.Towards the end of the hiking day we met two hikers wearing only blankets. They also had really heavy packs and foraged for mushrooms while stopping to talk with us. His name was Gemini and she was Flow. As we talked with the Honey Badger and a hiker named Sassy showed up. We hadn't seen Honey Badger since the first shelter in North Carolina. After chatting for a bit we wanted to go make camp. We were planning on staying at a campsite in the book that was down a blue blazed trail. We walked and walked but never found the trail. Finally we ended up at the Trimpi shelter making it a 22.8 mile day. We finished setting up camp and eating in the almost dark but still it was a good day.","camp before grayson highlands

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535099,"Day 44- May 25, 2016Today we started up the hill from trimpi shelter in our tent where we woke at 6am to an alarm. We got up and out by about 7:30 and headed up the hill. After about an hour we passed the couple we met yesterday, Gemini and flow. They had wanted us to see their tarp tent setup but we had passed by too late. It was a fairly simple day where we listened to our books only a little bit towards the end of the day. The terrain was fairly average with ridge line walks and rhododendrons tunnels with streams of water. Once we got to the first shelter, we met big bird who was a girl coming from the same shelter we had came from. There, we also found Merlot. She was excited to see us and told us about the shower that the shelter had. We skipped the shower but took a nice long break there. Apparently, because the shelter was so close to a town, pizza could be delivered there and the night before the shelter was filled with partiers. We didn't have time to order a pizza unfortunately but dregs and merlot shared in some chips left behind by the party crowd.After we left, we passed the visitor center and ditched some trash to lighten our load. A day hiker stopped dregs to talk and ask about the trail. We then saw Gemini and flow arrive as well. We continued on our hike up to a ridge and winded down to a creek near the last shelter. Dregs had run out of water and was frustrated with himself for not having water for the last few miles so we stopped before the shelter to fill up. Once we got to the shelter, we met three new people who's names I don't remember and it probably won't matter. Merlot showed up not log after and we all chatted for a bit. We stayed for about an hour before moving on, only 4 miles to Atkins, VA and we wanted to stop right before and camp. On that last stretch, we passed some day hikers that had a Vizsla and I almost teared up in excitement of seeing my favorite dog. Dregs made fun of me for how much I wanted a vizsla until about the time we found our home for the night. A small campsite right off the trail where we would set up. Dregs put on some country music and we prepared for the evening. We laid in our empty tent for a long while just relaxing and enjoying each other's company while we felt too lazy to set up. Eventually we got ready for bed and relaxed for a bit. It's been a good simple day with about 18 miles hiked. Tomorrow we go into town for a package and resupply along with some restaurants that we hear are pretty good.","trimpi shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536770,"Day 45- May 26, 2016Dregs here We woke up at what we thought was a campsite right before some power lines. After a few hundred feet of hiking in the morning our suspicions were confirmed. Only a few short hours into the day we came to a very old school house right next to a settlers museum. Storm Trooper was on the porch of the schoolhouse and he happily informed us that there was trail magic inside. Inside was basically everything a hiker could ever want from chips and soda to toiletries other supplies. It was awesome.As we sat and ate fresh fruit, Argonaut and Danger both arrived. Danger was a name we knew because our friend Red Dragon was trying to catch up to her and a group of people they started with. He apparently had caught them and would be along shortly. We sat for a bit and chatted before heading out. The big excitement for the day was the choice of 2 restaurants and a care package from one of my co workers. The restaurants were by the trail at a road crossing where we would then hitch hike into Atkins. As we emerged from the woods there were some train tracks to cross. Someone had taken loose railroad spikes to make the AT logo. The day got even better when we saw some deer in an open meadow. We came to the road and stuck out our thumbs. A nice family in a pick up truck picked us up and their young daughter sang us songs she learned in church. They dropped us off in the post office parking lot.At the counter after showing my ID I was handed a package from my coworker Jason. We sat on the curb and opened it up. The contents were so great, lots of Freeze dried meals and tons of candy. There was jerky and bug spray and all kinds of good stuff. It was such a boost to our mood that really carried on for several days as we ate good every night. It was really fantastic not to eat the same old things every night. Thanks Jason!We walked up the street to buy a few more resupply items from the dollar general and asked the clerk which restaurant option was better. She recommended The Barn. We headed across the street to hitch back and watched car after car pass us by. After 30min a pick up stopped and a grumpy guy said he would take us part of the way back. We got in and he said hold on and took us approximately 400 feet. We thanked him and continued walking and we came to a eclipse parked in a short driveway to nowhere. A shady looking young guy offered us a ride and then violently jammed our packs into his already packed trunk. After that was taken care of he told us stories of how him and his friends would hassle hikers back in the day. For good measure he had an ice pick tucked behind his ear. He was nice enough I suppose and he dropped us off at The Barn and wished us well. The Barn was great, we got burgers and charged our phones before making our way back into the woods with Argonaut. We went our separate ways and hiked a decent day. We came to a campsite at the top of a wooded mountain and decided to call it home for the night. After setting up we noticed some people paused at a sign just ahead. The sign indicated that we had hiked 1/4 of the entire AT. What a great day.After dinner 2 hikers came up the mountain. It was Rattlebee and Banana Pants. These 2 experienced hikers from Germany must have taken some time off in order for us to have gotten ahead. We offered to share the campsite and picked their brains for hiking tips. When they complete the AT they will both have completed the triple crown of long distance backpacking. Darkness fell and we all climbed into our tents.","campsite

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536779,"Day 46- May 27, 2016This morning we started at the 1/4 mark camp site. Rattle bee and banana pants left as we were waking up, those pct hikers are machines that never seem to stop. Dregs led the hike so that we could have a nice slow day hiking his pace but instead of going slow, he hiked super fast going about 3mph for the first half of the day. We got to a shelter where we planned to use the privy. When we arrived, neither one of us could find where the privy was but we really had to go. I ended up walking down a long trail to find it but led to nothing. After awhile, I came back up and found privy hidden not far from shelter. This was a very frustrating endeavor... We met two flip flop hikers at that shelter while we ate lunch who started two weeks ago and chatted with them for a bit. Then we kept hiking. It was a challenging day full of steep climbs and dregs went so fast that I eventually needed a break. He let me lead after that so I wouldn't die. It started to heavily rain as we went up a steep grassy plane. The trail was turned into a river of about 6 inches of water in most places. At first I tried not to get water in my shoes, but it wasn't long until I just walked through it cause we were soaked to the core. We got to a fully enclosed shelter at the top of the bald but it was packed full of hikers who didn't want to leave cause of the rain. We ate lunch outside of the shelter in the rain, cheese and pepperoni tortillas.it was quite delicious. Then we continued hiking. We got down to a gap where danger, storm trooper, red dragon, and their crew were. They said that Dangers dad was going to be doing trail magic at the next campsite. Though we didn't plan on going that far today, we set sail for that. It added another 4 miles to our day but in the end it was worth it. We hiked a 22.7 mile day and made it to the campsite where dangers dad and his girlfriend had made chili, salad and brought beer and chips. The couple doing the trail magic want to write a book about how to support through hikers, so they asked us questions and recorded the answers about what makes good trail magic and how to go about it. We set up camp in a spot not meant for a tent but it was the only flatish place not taken already. Lots of people showed up. We met Merlin, not even, big deal, and others. We ate, drank and socialized for a bit before I headed in for the night. While preparing for bed, my toenail finally came off! I was super excited and went to tell dregs who was still with people. Other hikers got excited with me over my toenail and we reflected on how being out here has changed what is socially acceptable to announce to strangers and take joy in. I went back to the tent and luckily, most of our clothes had dried from the earlier rain. I went to bed but dregs stayed out a little later to hang out with the large group of through hikers.","camp site at falls

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536773,"Day 47- May 28, 2016This morning we woke up knowing there would be trail magic to start the day. Dangers dad still had the party tent set up from the night before where he cooked chili for us. We walked over from our ""not real camp site"" and over to the covered area where we were greeted with the prospects of brewd coffee. We had about 4 or 5 refills of the small bowls full and then they made sausage and offered us bread with butter, fresh fruit, and cheese. We sat around and chatted with the family and some of the other hikers, storm trooper, danger, and red dragon, and then headed out for the trail. The terrain was relatively flat all morning and the weather was perfect, warm with the coolness of tree shade. We got about 5 miles in when we got to the next shelter. There, we came across the large group of night hikers who were still waking up and at about 11am. We got water from a stream and kept on hiking. Along the way, a south bound hiker passed us and told us that there was trail magic ahead. Dregs interrogated the man a bit, asking questions such as if it was a cooler left or people. He said people. We were excited for our second round of good trail magic of the day until we reached the road where the man had said they would be. We sadly looked up and down the road but there was no one around. As dregs slumped in disappointment, we turned to the trail and started up a small hill. Across the trail at the top of the small set of steps was a banner that was red white and blue with some patriotic phrase written out and many small USA flags around a tree. On the tree there was a sign that said ""trail magic 100ft"". From there, little flags lined the trail that led to a parking lot with a truck and trailer and a picnic table with a few people. They were making hot dogs and had tons of snacks and cookies and sodas. We ate two hotdogs and a bunch of the snacks while chatting with the family who set up the trail magic. Their kids played in a mud puddle and caught frogs which made me happy. After a nice long break, we got to hiking again. 7 miles to the road where we would spend 20 minutes hitching for a ride into town facing the wrong direction unintentionally. We gave up for a little to take inventory of our food we needed to resupply in town until two hikers we had just met at the Memorial Day trail magic, showed up and told us we were looking for a ride in the wrong direction. They started walking down the road to hitch and we stood finally in the right direction. Not long after, a lady with her small sweet dog picked us up. She flew down the twisty road to town and told us about her dog. We were dropped off at a grocery store and we got food for the next few days and some frozen cheesecake which was incredible. A guy on a motorcycle came over to talk to us and had his son, who was following in a truck, offer us a ride back to the trail. While they went shopping, we got cheese steak subs from Johnny's diner down the road. They picked us up from there when they were ready and we hopped into the bed of the truck. We were dropped off at the trail and just needed to find a spot to camp. We were taken on a road walk by the trail and got to a camp site right off the road. The water smelled like sewage and there was an overflowing trashcan so e didn't want to stay there. Willow, an older hiker we met yesterday, was sitting in that campsite and we chatted with her before deciding to try for a spot a little further. As we started passed the site, we realized we would be going up a large hill for about a mile before any spots would be available for camp. At the top we found a spot that was slightly slanted but we could make it work. Dregs went searching for a bear hang and discovered a nicer flat spot further back. We moved our stuff and set up. We had arrived at 7:45pm and so once set up we could watch the sunset from inside our tent. It was a beautiful orange. We found many inch worms and even a caterpillar on us while in the tent and freed our little friends. Today was a 20.9 mile day, we got great trail magic 2x, got hitches in and out of town, ate steak subs and cheesecake, and found a great campsite before dark. What an awesome day. And as we went to bed, the sound of the caterpillars poop bro point from the trees sounded as rain all around us.","camp grounds

He didn't know we were behind him all night and so he was surprised when we appeared from the woods behind him. We Walked 18.3 miles today with nothing particularly interesting happening. Caterpillars and their poop fell from trees all day like rain and the trail was littered with munched up leaves. Dregs listened to music and I, with no audio books left, watched the full length of Mulan scene by scene in my mind. I also sang the friends theme song in my head for multiple hours. We made it to the 600 mile marker where rocks where formed into the number. We got to a shelter to get water where we met some hikers new to us, firecracker, pace, squidward, and Whether or Not who had pretty dog that looked exhausted. At the end of the day we would get to some path to a waterfall but we went pass it to find a camp site before it rained. We found one near a beautiful stream but moved to a better one with less slope a little further. That site had many spots available but no one else ever showed up.

I had a mini freak out from exhaustion, tired, thought it was late, had to make over 20 miles to reach town easily tomorrow, everything felt yucky, gross and sticky. Dregs was very understanding. We got out by 7:30. Easy day, first 6 miles flat and uphill were very gradual accept for one. We stopped by a shelter that two ladies were Murdered at a long time ago. Then we went up a mountain. Got to a spring on the mountain that wasn't great but we filled up on water and it was a nice break from the steepness. Afterwards, we kept going. The most interesting thing that happened today was when we saw a snake catch a lizard. The lizard detached his tail and tried to crawl away but the snake came back after him and got him. It was a Brown garden snake and small black lizard. I had tried to video it but when it was over I realized I never hit record. I was very disappointed to have missed that nat-geo moment. We walked through some beautiful rhododendrons tunnels that had fully bloomed around us. Dregs and I walked arm in arm through the tunnel together. We made it to an overlook where we had reception so we made a reservation for a hotel in town for tomorrow. It was hard to get a room cause of the holiday. We got to a shelter to eat lunch and then kept walking until we found a spring to replenish water for the remainder of the day. finally, we hiked up to some power lines and saw dark rain clouds. We found the perfect home near by and quickly set up camp. Our day was done by 4:50pm, and we had hiked 21.1 miles. Later in the evening a man and his two young sons came up and camped near us.

But for some reason, my feet keep moving me steadily up the mountain and won't stop. My mouth is dry and I can't swallow but when I drink my water my stomach wants to puke cause it's so full from the Dairy Queen stop in town. This morning I downed two cups of coffee and a leftover corona from last night, a pop tart and a bacon chicken ranch sandwich, along with a snack wrap, some fries and an Oreo frappé. I keep telling myself it's only 8 miles today, but the sun beating down on me makes it seem like the 2 hours of hiking has already been a full day's work. We've just replenished our water and have only a little more hiking to do before we find home for the night. Now that we've stopped, it doesn't seem that bad. It's actually quite energizing to have done a big climb.Turns out we hiked a bit further than planned, 10 miles today. This morning was fun getting DQ with danger, storm trooper, red dragon, and the crew, and seeing them all again later in the day while getting water. They stayed at a camp site about a mile behind us and we found a cozy spot off the trail behind some boulders. We ate our packed out chicken tenders and fries for dinner and started smoking a nice cigar that Wayne sent us. As we smoked, it began to rain and thunder, so we made the wise decision to continue in the tent. It was quite nice being able to lay down and have the cigar while the rain poured around us. It got a bit smoky and I ended up with a little headache, but no big deal. We waited out the rain by watching fail videos on Dregs's phone.

Storm trooper stopped by and chatted a bit and the three of us left together. He hiked ahead and it was a fairly easy morning that just seemed to drag on. We were racing against the thunder storm that seemed to follow close behind us for a time. Half way through the day and right before our only large climb, the storm caught us. It poured for most of the climb and towards the top it slowed. The humidity was incredible so the cool rain was alright, but my shoes and socks squished making my damp feet sore. We stopped at a shelter at the top of the hill to eat lunch where we saw brew, storm trooper, red dragon and stick all pass by. Once back on the trail we were faced with flat but incredibly rocky and slippery terrain. It began to pour again which made us cautiously and slowly make our trek the rest of the way. About a mile before our campsite we got to a spring where a tent was set up on a very slanted hill. We later found out that it was firecracker avoiding the passing storm. Once at the camp site, the whole crew accept danger was there. We set up and all ate dinner together. Brew and storm trooper made a fire to dry out all of our socks and shoes and unfortunately a few of our socks fell in the fire, including mine. They were mostly saved with only small singe marks.

The weather was nice and the morning relaxing as we went downwards for a long time. We stopped at a shelter for water and then prepared for the three mile climb. The first half of the climb was tough but I felt energized and focused on powering up the mountain. Another hiker named lightning zipped up to us and said that he thought we were about half way done. After hearing that, my mind turned sad and defeated, thinking I've worked so hard for so long and could only be half way done. The mental battle for me switched so fast from feeling like we were close and doing so well, to feeling like it would never end and that I couldn't give any more effort or energy. From that point, I started slowing and feeling like I was in pain or uncomfortable. My body felt sluggish and time seemed to drag on. As I was feeling down, we came across a black snake that wouldn't move from the trail and so I stepped over it. When dregs went to pass it, it struck at him. He was frustrated with that and me for all of a sudden getting in a bad mood, but we pressed on. It wasn't long before we got to where the steepest part of the trail started and we powered up it for half a mile. It's crazy how little it takes to lose the mental game out here, but we overcame the struggle and continued on. Once we hit the top of the mountain, life felt good again. It was flat for a bit and then went down for a while. I briskly paced down the trail. As I turned a slight corner, before I even realized it, I was jumping back and quickly walking backwards towards dregs. My body knew before I even did that I almost stepped on the head of a large rattle snake stretched out across the trail. Dregs commended me on my reaction to the snake and we excitedly went back towards it. Another hiker, lightning, came down the trail and joins us in observing the beautiful golden rattler. We took some pictures and then walked around the snake off the trail. Dregs used a long branch to encourage the rattle snake off of the trail in hopes that no one behind us would have a similar close call. The snake did not rattle at us and seemed only slightly perturbed as it turned from the trail and curled up behind a downed tree. We continued on until we reached a shelter where we ate lunch and chatted with a hiker new to us, marmalade. He was an older gentleman from Manchester who we had passed at a shelter earlier in the day. After lunch, a dark gray cloud chased up towards our final climb of the day. As it stared to rain I hid beneath a plush tree and asked dregs of we could wait a few minutes to see if the storm would pass. To our delight, it did. Not a mile down the trail, we reached a field full of tall grass which made our efforts to avoid the wetness pointless. We got to see the second largest oak tree on the trail which was impressive and really really big. Then we went on. By the time we were on the steep climb, our bodies were tired and sore. I searched for some bit of hope to propel me the rest of the way up the incline. I looked at the map to see how long the climb was and was happy to see that it was just over a mile long. We had been climbing for a while so I knew it would be over soon. With that knowledge, I regained my momentum and powered the rest of the way up. It really is more of a mental battle than anything else, getting through these long tiring days. But when we got to the top, I felt energized and accomplished. We would have a nice flat trail for the next few miles until the shelter. The shelter and camp site happen to be half a mile down the side of the mountain and I know tomorrow I will not appreciate the climb up. There is something about walking miles that aren't blazed with white, let alone distances that are challenging. Either way, we made it home and met up with our friends there and ate dinner. The crew was again red dragon, storm trooper, stick, danger and brew. We will be coordinating with them for the next few days and zeroing with them in about 4 days. Dregs and I had our final cigar and enjoyed the evening with the group. 17 miles today.","wind rock camp ground

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536806,"Day 54Dregs here, As I lay here writing this we are nestled into our tent listening to a potentially severe thunderstorm roll in. All camp chores are done and food has been had. We have no dead trees near by and feel pretty safe about our tent site. It is the first day in 3 days where we have stayed dry, unless of course you count sweat. We have a not terribly challenging day heading into what is billed as the best restaurant on the trail tomorrow and a long but relatively flat day after that leading into a day off in town. Not a bad feeling at all.I awoke at 430 am this morning after trying to take a sip from my water bladder and finding it empty. This was particularly concerning because I went to sleep with a full 2 liters. After a very short investigation with my hand I found an almost inch deep puddle in the lowest corner of the tent which luckily was also where the water bladder was. This meant that only things I decided the night before to place in the low corner would be wet. Things like my cell phone and external battery......I moved the electronics and placed a fleece jacket in the small body of water adjacent to my down filled sleeping bag and decided that this was a problem for a later version of myself. Perhaps he would be able to deal with it because it was far beyond me. I awoke in the morning feeling sorry for myself. Between the aforementioned flood and loosing the gasket on my water filter the previous evening, I was feeling down on my luck. The missing gasket means that I will have to spill water everywhere when I filter it and gather more than I would otherwise need. I put my woes out of mind and set myself to my tasks. I resolved not to get super grumpy and ruin ChickenHawks day too. I warned her that it was going to take a while to pack up and I started carefully pulling my things out of the tent. After a while I was all packed up with no damage to my phone or battery.I walked over to the shelter and found out from ChickenHawk that Stick had an even worse night than I did. He was not feeling well but was planning on hiking anyway. The group of Stick, Danger, Brew, Red Dragon and Storm Trooper was planning on only going 16 to a shelter. They would then hike a short day to a hostel tomorrow and shuttle into Catawba VA where The Home Place restaurant is. We plan to stick with them today but skip the hostel and hike all the way to Catawba. We started out with a long climb back to the trail from the shelter. The trail was flat for a while but the day was hot. At a forkin the trail we followed schnitzel to the left for about 100 feet before realizing it was the wrong direction. The trail led onto a slanted rock face that was not the easiest to walk on. After a quarter mile or so I saw ChickenHawk jump back. She had apparently almost hit a rattlesnake with her trekking pole. 2 days in a row we saw rattlers that were in the trail and didn't rattle. After we were by it I again nudged it off the trail. This time we were rewarded with the classic and unmistakable sound of an agitated Rattlesnake. The rest of the day was hot and moderately difficult. We flip flopped back and fourth with our friends and saw some cool things like the Audie Murphy Memorial. Near the end of the day we came to a stream right before a mile long climb to the finish. The gang was set up and going to camp there for the night. ChickenHawk and I sadly pressed on to get us closer to our destination for the next day. Hopefully we will see them at dinner. We marched up the hill to the shelter and got situated just before the storm arrived. It has been raining the whole time I have been writing this however it seems all of the crazy thunder and lightning has passed. ChickenHawk is fast asleep next to me and it's time I join her.","sarver hollow shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537033,"Day 55- June 5, 2016Dregs here, Wake up time was much less eventful today. We packed up our wet tent and made our way up towards Dragons tooth. I had heard that this section was supposed to be difficult however I didn't want to tell ChickenHawk. She likes to be surprised by difficultly and not have to dread it. Just like every day we are going to a famous part of the trail all views were obscured by a very thick fog. We climbed along a rocky ridge line for 3 1/2 miles and it stretched on for a long time. It wasn't super difficult but it did feel longer that 3 1/2 miles. We got near the top and it began to rain. Dragons Tooth was .1 mi down a side trail. It was pretty cool and the clouds cleared up a bit adding some scenery behind the giant rock formation. We had our eyes set on an all you can eat restaurant called The Home Place so we headed down the mountain in the rain. After less than a tenth of a mile the descent turned into a rock scramble. No big deal. Even when wet we could just take it slow. Then the trail went down a 5 foot cliff. There were metal rungs pounded into the rock face to facilitate this. Obstacle traversed, now on to our easy downhill walk to food, or so we thought. For the next hour the trail wound down this mountain side through the most treacherous terrain we have experienced on this hike. It might have been different if it was dry but it still would be challenging. At the most difficult point we descended a wall of rock using only a six inch deep outcropping. Did I mention it was wet and slippery....We made it past the rock walking and on to an actual dirt trail. It was a relief to zoom along towards one of the most hyped restaurants on the journey. And then there was one more cliff to traverse. I stood at the top of this last little bit of climbing and thought to myself that it wasn't worth it....... Dragons Tooth was the worst work to view ratio on the trail so far. That being said, we were happy to have faced some difficult terrain and succeeded. We had about 7 1/2 miles to get to the road where we would hitch hike into Catawba for food. We ran into Danger who was waiting by a road that led to a hostel that she and the gang were all planning to stay at. We pressed on. The miles were easy but made more challenging by mud and running water. At some point in that stretch we passed the 700 mile mark! Towards the road we could hear cars and that made us hike faster. We made it the 12.6 miles by 2pm. Just as we made our way into the parking lot we saw a crowd of hikers by a car and a sign for trail magic.We walked over and sat for a while with drinks and snacks and great people. The trail magic was being put on by 2 ladies, one of which was a former thru hiker. They had everything we could want or need and even had tons of resupply items for free. We could have stayed for hours if not for the fact that we needed to get to the restaurant. My good friend Chris who attended near by Virginia Tech years ago, bought us dinner via PayPal specifically for this restaurant. It was one of his favorite places to go. Thanks Chris! We eventually made our way to the road and stuck out our thumbs. After a few minutes a car with a young couple inside stopped right in the traveling lane of a winding mountain road. It was a bit scary but no cars came as we loaded up. They were nice and took us the 1.5 miles to the front door which was blocked by about 30 people waiting to eat. ChickenHawk went to give our name and quickly came back saying there was no wait. Apparently all of the waiting people were in large parties. We sat and ordered. A table full of food was wheeled out to us. As we were eating, we saw the crew of Red Dragon, StormTropper, Danger, Stick, Brew and Firecracker. We said hello but wanted to get back to our food. They understood. The meal was everything a hungry hiker could want. Seriously. I don't know what more I can say. Life pretty much could not get much better. And then the server walked over and told us the lady at the first table paid for our meals! More trail magic. She had left before we could run over to say thanks. What amazing trail magic. What an amazing day. Surely it was about to go down hill fast as it was about to rain, we needed to hitchhike and then walk 2 miles.....There was no good spot to hitch so we walked and hitched, after 10 min a nice man picked us up in a minivan. He dropped us at the trail and we attempted to roll our swollen bellies up a mountain. Thankfully the climb wasn't bad and the rain held off. We made camp at the shelter campsite and took advantage of cell service to post some journal updates. Argonaut showed up and we chatted a bit before bed. What a day","pickle branch shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537034,"Day 56- June 6, 2016Today couldn't have been much more pleasant than it was. With two famous views on the trail, an easy 15 mile day over nice terrain, and no rain, we already were set up for a great day. It started off with us taking our time to get ready to leave camp. We knew we only had 15 miles to go so that we would be set up for a nearo into Dalesville, VA tomorrow. We also knew we weren't supposed to camp outside of designated camp sites in the national park so if we were to stealth camp, it would have to be late in the afternoon/evening. So we were in no rush to get out of camp. There were some rocky points in the morning with regards to communication between dregs and I, but after getting a little caffeine in us, we were all good. Before we set out, an older couple we had met at Over Mountain Shelter passed by and chatted with us for a bit. They are currently staying at the hotel we will be at tomorrow and had informed us of the multiple hiker boxes put out there. They said there were trekking poles and super feet in there, which dregs needs to replace    his while in town. If we don't have to spend the extra money, that would be awesome! We left the camp site at 10am and took our time getting up the first mountain. It was a very easy climb and went by fairly quickly. The first famous view we got to was MacAfee Knob. A small sign that said ""overlook"" pointed to a path right off the trail. Not expecting it to be the place we were so looking forward to getting to, we decided to check it out. As soon as we took the path, I was stunned by the glorious view. It was a series of large flat rocks that shelved off the side of the mountain and was an unobstructed view of the layers of mountains all the way left to right. In the middle was a shelf that protruded further than the rest and is the site of one of the most photographed places on the AT. This is where people come to sit and hang their feet off a cliff with nothing under them for possibly hundreds of feet. You really do feel like you are just floating in mid air above trees and valleys, looking out at endless mountains. I am terrified of heights. Everyone who is close to me knows this. But I had made up my mind before I even knew that we would be at this spot today, that when I got to the cliff, I would go to the edge and face my fears. I did not want to regret missing that opportunity so I had determined in my mind, weeks ago, I would do it. This made it easy for me, as soon as I realized this was my opportunity, not to think about how scared I was, only to think that someone better get a picture of me on the edge and they better do it quick before I fall and die. Dregs had gone over to the spot before me so I grabbed a few pictures of him fearlessly scooting to the edge. Then, I went over and asked a lady to take our picture together on the ledge. I made it a point not to look out at the vast emptiness in front of me and scootched in close to dregs. Then it was my turn alone. Dregs left my side and I was left to move closer to the edge. I accidentally looked out and got dizzy. I was so high up and there is nothing to catch me and wind just trying to push me off the mountain, I just knew it. I put on a brave face and tried to zone out while I had to sit on the edge of my death. Dregs finished taking the picture and I cautiously moved away from the edge slightly shaking. After that, we explored more of the cliff and talked to a hiker with a dog. With my new found confidence, I told dregs to get a shot of me standing on the edge with my pack. As I strut to the edge again, I unwittingly looked at the danger that I approached. I got to the edge and became dizzy again and had to balance myself with my trekking poles. It figures that right about that time, a large gust of wind attempted to knock me over. I yelled to dregs asking if he was finished getting the picture and then dashed back from the drop off. He was so proud of me for overcoming my crippling fear of heights and made me feel accomplished and proud of myself. I am so glad that I had that experience and did not pass it up from fear. We excitedly trekked up a few more small climbs and were in awe of the beautiful rock formations that surrounded us. They led us up to the second famous location of the day, Tinker Cliffs. It is half a mile of walking on the edge of the cliff where rocked protrude from the mountain like shelfs and drop off. It was absolutely beautiful and fun. We found a rock ledge that stuck out far off the mountain and we ate lunch there. Directly across from us, we could see MacAfee Knob where we were a few hours before. This has been, in my opinion, the prettiest and most enjoyable part of the trail yet. Following tinker cliffs, we wound down the mountain, still enjoying the beautiful weather. It was warm, supposedly the hottest day yet, but with the shade of the trees and cool breeze, it felt perfect. We stopped at a shelter that is closed due to a problem bear so that we could replenish our water supply and then headed to find camp for the night. We arrived at a spot labeled as camping, but didn't see any viable spots. A few other hikers said that they thought there were flat spots at the bottom of the massively long and steep logging road, but that it wasn't worth going all the way down. We decide to continue hiking on and hoping to find a better spot. Not long after, we came across what would be our home for the night, and it wasn't even 6pm yet. It was surprising to have gotten in so early after getting a late start and lounging throughout the day. We set up camp and ate dinner, went up to an overlook to watch the sun go down and met a hiker named spoon there. We came back down and are now preparing for bed. I am excited for tomorrow, getting into town and having a shower. The toughest part of being out here, for me, is the sticky feeling of sweatiness while sleeping and when waking up. A shower will be much appreciated along with a bed and no sticky yucky uncomfortableness. Today was such a good day full of fun and excitement, overcoming fears and being blessed with beautiful weather and views.","camping

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537505,"Day 57 and 58Dregs hereGoing to try to cover a couple of days here. We woke up at the makeshift designated campsite near Hay Rock that we were forced to use because of bear activity closing an area. We were both really excited about only hiking 4.5 miles and then resting for a day and a half. All of our things were packed up in less than an hour. We took it slow but the terrain was easy and we managed to catch up with a hiker named Judy that we had met a couple days ago. She was just a few tenths of a mile from the end of her through hike. She needed to take care of some family things. We stayed and chatted with her for a bit before we pressed on towards relaxation and town food. We stepped out of the woods and into Daleville VA. Our hotel was directly to the right less than 50 yards away. We checked in and picked up a couple of packages people had mailed to us. Our room was up a hill and farther away from the office than we wanted it to be. The room was great, or so we thought, and we immediately went for our packages. The first was the less exciting box from brother containing a few supplies from home that we needed. Thanks Eric! Next we tore into a box from Chicken Hawks mom. It was filled with wrapped presents!!! Chicken Hawk is turning 25 on the 10th and I will be 30 on the 14th. Thank you very much for all of the great gifts!! Next on the agenda was food. We decided this time to only eat at a restaurant once and get food from a grocery store for the other meals to save money. We walked about a half mile to a Kroger and got some food. I got a huge chefs salad and Chicken Hawk got a deli sandwich that had 3/4 lb of meats on it. We were very satisfied. In the same shopping center was an outfitter where we were dreading going to because it was going to take a serious toll on our wallets. We both needed new socks, I needed new shoes, insoles and trekking poles. We had found some insoles for me to try in a hiker free box at the hotel. The outfitter had a clearance section and I was able to find some shoes that would work for 30% off. Lastly I opted to go for a sturdy but simple $60 pair of trekking poles instead of the $140 ones that would have matched Chicken Hawks. It ended up not being that bad. Next we went back to the grocery store to buy some food for later. We got sandwich rolls and all the fixings for some hearty filling sandwiches. We started our walk back to the hotel with all of our heavy stuff. Almost as soon as we got to the main road a truck pulled over and told us to hop in. It was Judy's husband and Chia Pet! They took us right to our hotel door. The next part is always my favorite. We finally showered. Good hot long showers......so nice. We relaxed and made sandwiches that were fantastic for dinner. There was only one problem. Our room was hot despite the AC being on full all day. It was 10 degrees hotter in our room than outside. We walked to the office and they were really nice. They let us move to a new room. We set up in there and turned the air on. While it was cooling we went on a mission to find milk and cookies without going all the way back to the grocery store. After succeeding, we did our laundry and some relaxing. It was getting late when I moved the load from the washer to the dryer. The dryer made a sound like a machine gun.... It did sound like it was actually working possibly even too well but I couldn't keep all the hikers awake with the crazy loud dry so I hung the clothes in the room. It was the end of a great day and after a short fight over who got the better pillows we went to bed. We woke up at about 8am and limped to the free continental breakfast. It was decent and we got to socialize with other hikers. We went back to our room and lounged about before walking back to the same shopping center for more errands. We saw Blue Sky and Bombay on the way. They caught back up because of our zero day and it was nice to see them. We sent a few items home at the UPS store and then went back to the outfitter. They had brought a universal fitted sheet from their other location for Chicken Hawk so that she could attach her blanket to her sleeping pad. I also needed insoles as the free ones didn't quite fit correctly. While doing all of this we realized we should have sent home our cold weather sleeping bags in the ups box we had just mailed. I rushed over to see if they could let us go get our bags and add them to our boxes. The agreed and we walked back to the motel and then back out again. On the way back to the UPS store we saw a famous hiker named Seven and it was cool to chat with him. We sent our heavy bags home and then ran into Schnitzel. We helped him figure out where to send his cold weather gear. Our next stop was our one restaurant visit. A barbecue place called Three little pigs. We sat next to our friends Red Dragon, Brew, Stick, StormTropper and Danger. They left not to long after but we had some really good food to keep us company. The hiker yearbook guy Odie was there and he took our pictures for the hiker yearbook. He also have us a box of Ding Dongs. He is now one of my favorite people. After dinner we hit the Kroger one last time to resupply and then walked home. We spent the evening calling family members while I treated our clothes with permethrin. Once that was done it was all relaxing in our air conditioned room with our nice soft beds. There was another physical altercation over who got the better pillows. Chicken Hawk thought she had won when she firmly grasped the best one with her arms and legs..... I however turned the tides when I wrapped her and the pillow up into the comforter forming one large even better pillow for my use. After that excitement died down we dozed off for a great night sleep.","outside of dalesville, VA

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537497,"Day 59- June 9, 2016Finally a good night sleep. Wonderful comforters, a soft pillow, and being clean. To not wake up feeling sticky and gross is the most amazing part of getting into a town and it takes a few nights to get use to the unusually comfortable feeling. So this morning I woke up feeling great. We made it out to the continental breakfast at about 7:30 and enjoyed biscuits and gravy, bagels, and waffles with our friend storm trooper. Many other hikers we have met before passed through for breakfast and we said hello to most of them. Once finished, we went back to our room to pack up our stuff and make sandwiches for lunch and to pack out to the trail. As we were leaving, we saw red dragon who told us that danger and stick were sick and that their group would be taking another zero day for them to get better. That is the tough part about being tied into a group, sticking together even when it means spending more money and not making miles on days when you could. But we aren't tied into the group too tightly so we wished them well and checked out of the motel. As we started hiking, the uncomfortable feelings that are always amplified by taking a day off from hiking began. My new socks were rubbing the wrong way, my pack felt heavy even though we sent home our sleeping bags, and i felt tired and hot. We knew it would take a few hours to readjust to the trail and luckily it was quite an easy day. Dregs and I had fun conversations about wanting to train for a marathon after the trail and then we contemplated names for the Vizslas that will be our reward for finishing the trail. We talked about wanting to have a community group when we get back and what it would be like to move to Washington state. Time flew by and we got to a shelter 11.2 miles in. We ate our sandwiches that we packed out and continued on to look for our home for the night. We passed up a few slanty sites because it was still fairly early and wanted the perfect home. Finally, after passing the beginning of the blue ridge parkway, which will be with us through Shenandoah, we found a great spot to camp. We set up the tent and as we were unpacking our stuff for the night, storm trooper rolled up the mountain. We were shocked but delighted to see him. I figured he would have stayed back with his group with danger and RD, but he decided to press on. Dregs invited him to hike along with us if his other group didn't catch up. We will probably be doing similar mile days and keep pace with each other. The three of us ate dinner and enjoyed some chocolate treats before heading into our tents for the night. Tonight I try out my fitted sheet on my sleeping pad. Hopefully we are warm enough with just our small blankets. Also, tomorrow is my 25th birthday. Random things throughout the last few days have had to keep reminding me about it. I get excited every time I remember, but it doesn't feel like it's tomorrow. Hopefully it is a beautiful day out and easy terrain.   ","outside of dalesville, VA

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538576,"Day 60- June 10, 2016Dregs woke up to a very cranky and frustrated 25 year old chicken hawk. I was upset that I was unable to get any sleep, probably due to the chocolate ding dong I had as dessert or maybe I was just readjusting to being back out in the woods, or a combination of the two. Either way I was tired and frustrated and slightly sad that for my 25th birthday I would just be walking all day with nothing special to look forward to. It was morning and I was hanging out on the wrong side of the bed. But dregs lovingly said happy birthday and immediately began to pack up with the goal of leaving camp by 7am, which I've been wanting to do for a bit. We were able to start hiking at 7:05 and I was overjoyed. It sounds simple, packing up and getting a move on, but it is a constant struggle to want to lay there not moving when we wake up and then zoning out for long periods of time as you attempt to organize your pack and do morning chores. To get my birthday started out better than when I woke up, dregs took initiative and got us out early! This has been a big topic of discussion between us lately where we are both trying to find ways to compromise in how we'd like to hike. Dregs would like to hike big miles and be able to take longer or more frequent breaks while I want to start early and end the day by about 5pm so we have time to relax at the end of the day. We have decided to try to wake up early, hike as we feel along with breaking as we feel, and start looking for a camp site at 5-6pm. This morning was the first time we tested out our new system and it seemed to work like a charm. We hiked a nice section that only became a challenge at the end of the day with a very long uphill. We were able to reach our destination 21.1 miles in before 5pm. Because we were able to get out early in the morning we got miles in before it got really hot out and before we ran out of energy for the day. Anyways, when in camp, dregs and I laid down in the tent and he flipped around to give me a wonderful birthday foot massage. It was exactly what I needed after the long day of hiking and felt amazing. After, we ate dinner with storm trooper and shared a dessert raspberry crumble that our friend, bear wall, gave me for my birthday at lunch. Schnitzel stopped by on the way to a shelter not to far and hung out with us for a bit and then we headed in for bed. I hope tonight I get a better night sleep, but today turned out to be a great day, dregs really made the day feel special for me, and I got to spend my 25th birthday hiking the Appalachian Trail. Doesn't get much better than this.","passed blue ridge pkwy start

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538583,"Dregs here, We are behind quite a few days so I will be covering a lot of ground with very little detail. After carful consideration I have decided that it is Stormtroopers fault that our journal is out of date. We have been sharing camp with him and having campfires in the evening leaving no time before bed to write.Day 61On this day we hiked from a campsite just before Cornelius creek shelter to the camping area of Matts Creek shelter. It's was 19.5 miles and set us up for a quick trip to Glasgow VA in the morning. It was one of the hottest days on the trail so far and there were lots of day hikers out. The shelter had tons of camping space and a creek running right through it. I soaked my aching feet in the ice cold creek and they felt great all night. We met a Canadian guy who was just a week into his hike heading north to Maine. StormTrooper named him Gentle Giant. Chia pet showed up and we all chatted over a fire before bed. It is also worth noting that this shelter had the nicest privy so far. I would go into detail however I didn't go in myself. Day 62This day was a bit more eventful. We woke up and walked the rest of the way down a mountain and along the James River. It was a beautiful scenic crossing over the James River foot bridge. This put us on a road where we need to hitchhike into town. Schnitzel was also trying to hitch but from the wrong side of the road. We were able to get a man who was getting ready to do some kayaking and who was already doing some drinking at 10 AM, to take us into town and we even convinced him to take schnitzel. Glasgow was great. We resupplied at dollar general and got snacks. We walked to a free hiker shelter and packed our food. They had a hot outdoor shower that we all used as well. The last part of the plan was that Chicken Hawk, StormTrooper, and I would get some pizza before hitching back. We invited Gentle Giant to come along too. The pizzas were great and huge. Everyone ate way to much. We needed to walk out of town to hitch. The first guy who stopped took Schnitzel and another hiker but had no room for us. We made it back and started a huge climb in the heat.The tons of greasy pizza in our stomachs made us thirsty. The 90 plus degree weather made us thirsty. The over 2000 ft climb made us thirsty. We all ran out of water. Chicken Hawk, StormTrooper, and Dregs. All of us. We would need to take a 1 mile detour to get water but at least then we wouldn't need to go all the way to the shelter. We got to the trail and all pulled out our various water containers. This is when StormTrooper realized he had a 1/2 liter left which we promptly split up and drank. And then the trail to water was impassable....we had to go dry all the way to the shelter, another 3.2 miles. After being mostly dry for a mile......we got to the crowded punchbowl shelter and were sad to see the water source was a brown lake. I drank 2L of brown lake water as fast I could filter it. Same for Chicken hawk. We had lots of friends staying at punchbowl shelter but it was way too crowded and StormTrooper had a friend coming to meet him a bit farther north. Firecracker, Blue Sky, and Bombay were all there. As we left 6 more hikers came in.We found campsites and better water right after the spot that StormTroopers friend was going to meet us. She was awesome and brought fried chicken and fruit. We caught a great sunset and stayed up late talking. Lots of highs and lows in one day. One of the most eventful days yet. In total with the resupply and restaurant stop it was 17.2 miles.","harpers creek shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538579,"Day 63- June 13, 2016This morning we woke up at our site near the gravel road cold and tired from staying up late with storm troopers friend, Vivacious. We had a great evening before with them, eating fruit and fried chicken, but stayed up until about 11:30. The night had gotten cold as well, so it was hard to sleep most of the night. With all of that, we were able to get up and on the trail by 7:30am. The cool air made our morning the perfect temperature for hiking and had a very pleasant breeze. We made our way towards one of the last large climbs until Massachusetts. The trail followed a beautiful cascading stream with large boulders and pools of water. I wanted to go swimming so bad, but it was still slightly chilly out and we had miles to make. Today we passed the 800 mile mark! I almost missed it, but a small set up of twigs and sticks were aligned to spell out ""800 miles"" on the side of the trail. It's crazy to think how far we have come and exciting to know that we aren't even half way done our adventure. So much can and will happen and so much has changed sense the beginning. Things will continue to change and our journey will continue to surprise us. After we saw the sign, we began the climb that was 6 miles up and got so steep about half way up that I questioned whether or not we were actually on the AT. Lunch was had about two miles from the top and then we were off again. The rest of the hike was relatively easy and the weather Saturday at about 75 degrees and shaded by the green tunnel. We stopped at a field with camp sites to get water for the rest of the evening and found spoon, fire cracker, and two other hikers we had met there. Storm trooper showed up not long after and the three of us pressed on to search out a camp site for the evening. We hiked through lots of very high grass and overgrown underbrush to a site right before a road. Storm trooper made a fire and we got our tents set up. Our two tents are just inches from each other so I'm sure he will be wondering why there is so much laughter and snorting sounds coming from our tent. Dregs is being his goofy self and smells really bad. He keeps stealing my pillow and trying to get me to wear his sweaty gross buff as it is his birthday tomorrow and it would make him happy to see me grossed out. 18.9miles","camp site before shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538581,"Day 64- June 14, 2016It's Dregs's 30th birthday!! We woke up after a pretty good now guy sleep for both of us and slowly prepared to get out of the tent. Dregs was being goofy and making me laugh, I may have even snorted quietly. We heard our very close neighbor, storm trooper, say jokingly, ""keep it down over there"". Our tents were mere inches from each other and nylon walls have zero sound resistance. We got out of the tent and continued to prep to hike slowly as dregs enjoyed morning conversation with trooper. It's his birthday so I tried my best not to hurry him along when he got caught up in socializing throughout the day. We got on the trail by 8 and had a very easy 12 or so miles. The second half of the day was a bit more challenging. We stopped for water at the first stream and talked with the other hikers that showed up, Dragonfly and her husband Cat Skinner, chia pet, and storm trooper who was hiking with us. We spent a good amount of time there before continuing on the trail. Up a small climb, we go to a site called Spy Rock. After dropping our packs, we climbed up a mountainous boulder to the top where we had a 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains. It was beautiful. Once down from the rock, lunch was had with a trail maintenance guy. Dragonfly and cat skinner showed up and we spent some time chatting with them and then we pressed on. By then, it was about 2pm and still had about 12 miles to hike. This was slightly discouraging and put us in a somber mood for a bit. As we began to descend the mountain called ""the priest"", I struggled with slipping on the gravelly rocks and placing my feet as to not roll my ankle. It was frustrating and slow going, but the slope soon got less steep and the trail was less rocky. We got to a small waterfall where we refilled our water and an old man hiking passed us with news that his wife was at the bottom with trail magic. Our spirits were lifted and dregs, storm trooper, and myself picked up our pace to get to the road. We arrived at the road where a lady sat holding a small blind dog with a table full of goodies set up. There was fruit, candy, snacks, sodas and more. Firecracker was already there and we all sat and enjoyed this special treat. After filling up, we only had 2.8 miles up a mountain to the camp site we wanted to stay at. We booked it up the mountain to the site where we found large camp areas all around. Once set up, trooper made a fire and we ate dinner. I found 3 ticks which was bothersome, but only one was on me/ my shoe. Dregs received a birthday foot massage and we prepared for the warm night. We did 19 miles today.","camp site with overgrown underbrush

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540265,"Day 65- June 15, 2016This journal will be short as we are trying to get caught up. On day 65 we hiked 18.7 miles. We climbed three ridges mountain which will be the biggest climb for quite a while, like until Massachusetts. It was rocky and actually kind of difficult but had one of the best views near the top. Towards the end of the day we found another good campsite short of a shelter putting us in a decent position to going to Waynesboro the next day. Lee and Frolic joined our small campsite which was initially kind of strange but turned out OK. In the middle of the night we heard screaming and yelling at someone was having a lot of trouble with the bear in the distance. Not a good sign as we prepare to head into the Shenandoah national Park.Day 66- June 16, 2016We woke up unmolested by bears and had a very eventful walk the 8.3 miles to Rockfish gap. We hiked fast anticipating good food and clean showers, storm trooper lagged behind but saw a cub at the shelter which apparently was there menacing some section hikers all night. Not too far after that we all saw a rattlesnake just off the trail. As we walked along chicken hawk and I saw an even larger bear running through the woods just up the hill, Mr. storm trooper did not see this bear and we were sure to rub that in. We got to Rockfish gap we were standing there figuring out where to start hitching from when someone rolled up and offered to give us a ride. They let us out at the quality Inn and we were told we needed to wait to check in. While waiting we headed into town to get some of our chores done. The post office was the first stop. At the post office was a package from my aunt Jody containing a birthday surprise for both me and chicken hawk. The box contained two of every flavor of kind bar and literally the best brownies I've ever had. I don't know if that's because I'm a hiker and everything tastes good but I am almost sure they were the best brownies ever made. Thank you so much Aunt Jody!The grocery store wasn't too far away so we handled all of our resupplying before heading back to the motel to check in. We then had the much anticipated showers before heading out for coffee. We enjoyed our coffee as we headed to the laundromat and got the rest of our possessions cleaned. We use this time to form the rest of our plan on how the three of us were going to get to outback steakhouse for our birthday dinner. We ended up taking a cab that took a long time to get there. The steak was unbelievably amazingly good. Exactly what we were dreaming of for our birthday treat. It was awesome to have storm trooper there as good company. As a birthday present to us he paid for the cab rides to and from the steakhouse. After dinner we walked/ran to the Walmart across the street as a severe thunderstorm with the potential of tornadoes rolled in. We waited it out in Walmart and got a few other items. After taking a cab ride home storm trooper and I watch the Cavs win game six which meant that a few days later for game seven I had a interesting task of making sure to see game 7.","woods

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538585,"Day 67- June 17, 2016After a fitful night of tossing and turning in our unusually comfortable bed, we got up for breakfast. It was after 9am and the continental breakfast at the Inn ended at 9:30. We quickly prepared to head over to the next building over when we realized it was pouring down rain. We ran back to get our rain jackets that for some reason wouldn't zip on either one. Once we got over to the breakfast area, we saw storm trooper and whether-or-not. Dregs got his food and sat down near them. I went over to make a waffle and as I pressed the button to pour the batter into a small cup, the nozzle broke off and waffle batter came spilling out all over the place. I struggled to cover the hole in which it all came from and a few people jumped up to help me. While the lobby manager tried to fix the broken waffle machine and help clean up the spillage, I was able to grab the small cup that happen to fill with batter during the ordeal and pour it into the waffle iron. I successfully made the last waffle that the machine could produce. After breakfast, storm trooper graciously braved the rain to walk over to a coffee shop and bought dregs and I some wonderful coffee/ mocha. We drank our beverages and went to pack up for checkout by 11. Once checked out, another hiker we recently met, brother blood, called a lady to come give him a ride back to the trail. They offered to take trooper, dregs and myself back as well. Once back at the trail, the rain seemed to let up. It was very humid and drizzled a little. It wasn't long until the rain fully stopped and the sky turned blue. About a mile in, we reached the start of the Shenandoah national park. It is a pretty exciting milestone to be here and I am excited that it one of the most dense bear populated areas on the trail. Not far after, we saw some of our friends at the first spring including squidward, who also is a former Apple employee, and Pace. The three of us continued hiking with the intention of going about 10 miles. We chatted for the majority of the hike and all stayed together. It ended up being about a 13 mile day by 5:15 when we found our campsite. We set up and ate dinner, then headed in for the night. No rain in the forecast for tonight or tomorrow and our friends, James and Sarah, will be coming to hike with us tomorrow.

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539916,"Day 68 June 18, 2016Dregs here, it has been far too long since our last post. This was a great day. We had to walk 14 miles before seeing our friends James and Sarah. We got off to a good start in the morning but we were stalled by a mother bear and what we thought were 2 cubs. As it turns out it was 3 cubs. They were sitting just off of the trail and would not get out of the way. We kept walking backwards and making noises we advanced forward to trying get them to move. Eventually we had to give up and bushwhack around. After a short little bushwhacking trip we stumbled across firecracker, Pace , and schnitzel. While we sat there and chatted about the Bears storm trooper came walking right down the trail and right in front of the Bears that he obviously didn't see scaring them off into the woods. The second delay came in the form of being on TV. A Man stopped us and asked us if we wanted to be on a local broadcast about the area and he asked us a few questions and we answered. It was tough but we eventually did make our 14 miles. Because of poor cell phone reception it was difficult to meet up with friends but eventually Sarah found us at the loft Mountain Campground. In the car on the way a bear crossed the road right in front of a bear crossing sign. She gave us a ride to where James was set up to make us burgers. What awesome trail magic. After that we all packed up and we hiked out into the woods. We hiked in additional 7.8 miles which is a little farther than we planned because we came to a very crowded shelter. They did an excellent job and hiking and didn't do any complaining at all. We saw another bear while hiking bringing our total to six for the day.!We made camp on a mountaintop and they made us an amazing dinner of broccoli soup with fresh potatoes and turkey bacon. Storm trooper was there for good company and to make sure there was no leftovers. We all ate plenty and we're happy. At some point during the food eating process a small deer bizarrely charged right at us as if it didn't see us. We made some noise and he turned at the last second. We are all headed off to bed after a day of good fellowship and food. In total it was a 21.8 mile day that included some hiking with people who didn't have Trail legs. A major success in our minds and was one of the best days on the trail so far. Thank you James and Sarah!!!","shennendoah

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540266,"Day 69- June 19, 2016Dregs here,This was another great day, possibly my personal favorite but for off trail reasons as well as on. We woke up and our friends made us a wonderful breakfast of bacon and cinnamon rolls. It was truly great to hang out with them and it was a real blessing to get three meals as a gift from them. After packing up camp our friends hiked back to their car and we said our goodbyes. Not too far into the day we passed the 900 mile mark. Not too long after that we came to a road crossing where there was some really great trail magic. There was a couple with sloppy Joe's, beer, homemade banana muffins and they also had some resupply items for free. We walked away from there with a hiker named Mossman and had some good conversations for a bit. We met back up with storm trooper and started making plans about how we were going to see game seven of the NBA finals. We found a camp near skyline Drive and discussed whether or not all three of us would be leaving the trail. Chicken Hawk said she wanted to stay. The plan was to hitchhike 6 miles south to an exit of the park and then hitchhike an additional 3 miles to a cabin that we had rented. Chicken hawk would stay on the trail and sleep in the woods like usual. There was a PATC cabin right next to where we were set up and they had more trail magic. Me and StormTrooper headed off on our adventure and we will hear about the evening from chicken Hawks perspective first. Chicken HawkSo while dregs and storm trooper are off on their quest to watch game 7 of the playoffs between the cavs and warriors, I have chosen to stay behind and make camp on my own. I am excited for my own little adventure of being out here on my own for the first time and doing some of the things that dregs usually does like hang a bear bag. Before they left, dregs helped me find a good tree for the bear bag hang but I got to throw the rope and figure out the PCT method on my own. I've only watched how to make the knot twice before, in Georgia, yet I believe I did it correctly. Once my food was hung, I walked over to a cabin not too far from my camp spot where a family had set up for trail magic. They served me two BLT's, watermelon, and homemade pound cake made by the little girl. The girl asked me all sorts of questions about the trail and wrote them down as she likes to keep track of hikers answers. Another hiker happened by the cabin looking for water and was talked into coming over and having a sandwich. He said his name was free bird and apparently has met trooper a few times. We all chatted for a bit and then I headed back to my site for some much needed RnR. Apparently I am surrounded by bears as other hikers have reported seeing 6 bears in the last 5 miles. While in my tent, I have heard something approaching my site from the woods. I clapped my hands and the animal seemed to turn and head back the opposite direction. If it was a deer, no problem. If it was a bear, I'm sure it will be back later to check me out. I am excited to get to listen to my book and go to sleep when I want and have all the space to myself. I hope dregs and storm trooper get to watch their game and come back early tomorrow ready to hike. I'm sure their adventures will be more interesting than my quiet evening, but I'm glad I stayed. 16.8 milesDregs againWe hiked out to the road and started heading south along the road. Storm trooper and I stuck at our thumbs to hitchhike but there was clearly no place to safely stop. We had to walk a couple miles on the road to get to an overlook where we could stand still and hitch. After sitting there for a long time someone finally stopped and got us and took us out of the park and all the way to our destination. I saw that he had a small container of cigars and did my best to impress upon him that I loved cigars and didn't get to have them very often. After dropping us off he came over and handed me a cigar. We went into the office and got our key in and get situated in our cabin. I raced around cooking pizzas and taking showers trying to get everything done before the game started. The pizzas were good enough and the game was excellent. The Cavs won the championship making this Cleveland boy very happy. After watching all of the post game we sat outside and smoked a victory cigar. I was too excited for sleep so I didn't get the best night of rest but still this was one of the best days!","woods

It took 4 hours to hitch back to the spot where we left the trail. Chicken Hawk was having the time of her life. She was relaxing in the tent without the rain fly. She was bad and ate in the tent without me there to object. We got back at 11 and hiked on. Chicken Hawk kept saying ""look a bear"" to mess with StormTrooper. He sped off and we lagged all day. There were bad water sources and we didn't catch him until the end of the day. The trickle of a spring was filled with nematodes. We found a campsite near skyline Drive and called it a night. Day 71We woke up early with the idea of getting breakfast at Skyland lodge. It would be tasty food for our bellies but also keep us out of a morning storm. The plan worked great for the storm and the bellies. We saw lots of deer after breakfast and there was a wild turkey near the trail. Lunch was at 2pm under a bathroom pavilion and it started to pour. It rained all afternoon but stopped in the evening. We had dinner at the Elk Wallow Wayside with no name. We walked a mile up a mountain to camp for the night. 20.8 milesDay 72This was the day StormTrooper broke away to leave the trail for a wedding. We hiked 24 miles and crossed out of SNP!

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539914,"Day 73– June 23, 2016Today we woke up to rain. Last night the thunder shook the ground and lightning made it bright as day. We had decided the night before that if there was rain in the morning, we would sleep in until 8 to see if the rain would stop. At around 8:30 the rain slowed and we started packing up to hit the trail, we would most likely be drenched all day anyway. As we were packing up and getting ready to go, dregs and I chatted with a hiker, named smalls, who's friends had decided to go into town rather than meet him at the shelter as planned. The rain came to a stop and we had our chance to take off and start the day dry. The real trouble with rain is when your feet get wet and it's the worst when your feet are wet the entire day. That is how blisters destroy you. Anyways, we set out. It was a fairly uneventful day as we hiked. We passed and got passed multiple times by a hiker named Turbo and was slowed down for a long section of large downed trees that lay across the trail. After checking the weather multiple times and seeing that the rain chance kept changing, we decided to push for some faster miles. We hiked about 2.8 mph all day and eventually decided to pull a 22 mile day. We had expected to only go about 17 miles today, but being so blessed as to have still not gotten rained on, it was exciting to press on. We were also motivated to get further so that we could have a shorter day into Harper's Ferry on Saturday where we will be picked up for a short trip home. Dregs and I made it over the first two hills of The Rollercoaster and camped at a small slanty campground near a stream. We met a section hiker and his son and quickly got ready for bed.

We climbed the first peak of the day and found trail magic waiting there. Former thru hikers giving out goodies. The roller coaster was not too hard but definitely not enjoyable. In the middle of the roller coaster section we crossed the 1000 mile marker! Not too long after that we crossed out of Virginia and into WV. These were 2 huge and moral lifting milestones. We hiked to 2.8 miles after the David Lesser shelter which set us up for a nearo into Harper's Ferry in the AM!Day 75 76 77We walked in to Harper's Ferry and got our pictures taken at the ATC.

It's the first wonderful news guy sleep either one of us has had in quite some time. I slept all the way through the night, didn't feel sticky, the temperature was perfect, and our clothes and blankets were clean. It felt marvelous. Still wanting storm topper to catch up to us, we had decided not to push ourselves today. We are home and know the terrain here, so we felt at ease for the coming day. Walking through the familiar territory brought back memories from when we were training for the through hike and dreaming about making it this far. It was almost unimaginable to be able to walk from Georgia all the way here, yet, here we are. I remember all of the times these hills crushed me and pushed me to my limits. Now I walk over them with ease. I feel like the once large mountains look almost flat now with the images of the past 1000 miles as a means of comparison. We took on two of my former foes today, the Annapolis rocks climb and Raven rock. Looking through the lens of experience, they seem so insignificant now. We ran into crash a few times during the day and eventually were convinced to press on further so that we could make it to PenMar park where we could have pizza delivered. It ended up being a 24.3 mile day even though we were trying to let trooper catch up. We readjusted the plan for tomorrow so he would have time to catch us. Pizza was had in the same place we had sat with through hikers two years before, who stressed the glory of a large meal delivered right to the trail. They were right, it was wonderful. Right past PenMar was the Mason-Dixon Line. This significant point marks our exit from the south and the start of the northern section of our hike. It also is the MD/PA line marking the start of our seventh state. We camped right before a campground, right off the trail.

We hiked the remaining 6ish miles to Tumbling Run Shelter where we found some secluded camping down a blue blaze trail. We told stories over a fire about what happened while we weren't together. Day 81This was a 21 mile day that was mostly flat but started with the climb up to chimney rocks. Midday we came to Caledonia State Park and got food at the snack bar. We spent an hour at the Quarry Gap Shelter because it was so nice. Towards the end of the day chicken hawk pushed on alone to find us a camp.Day 82Another exciting day. We crossed the old and current half way points of the trail! We made it farther north on the trail than we had ever been before! The best part was we hiked another 20 mile day to meet up with our good friends Jordan and Diana. But first we watched our buddy eat a half gallon of ice cream at Pine Grove Furnace State Park. We were excited to watch him successfully complete the half-gallon challenge. I arrived last to camp and finished set up. Jordan and Diana made us chili and had tons of fresh fruit.

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540783,"Day 83- July 3, 2016This morning we got to sleep in and take our time waking up as we knew we would be spending the first portion of the day with Diana and Jordan. I slept pretty well with a nice full belly from the great chilli Jordan made and all of the delicious fresh fruit. As we began to stir, jordan joined us. Dregs, trooper, Jordan and myself sat in the comfortable camp chairs and chatted a bit until Jordan woke up Diana. It was a chilly morning and we were all moving slow, not that we were in any hurry. After finishing the remainder of the fruit and food they brought, dregs and trooper laboriously tried to figure out a plan for the day. We eventually decided on a short day of hiking and going into town with our friends for pizza, resupply, and laundry. We loaded into the car, 5 people, 3 packs, five camp chairs, a cooler and all of the rest of j&d's camping equipment all in their small Honda Fit. We were able to get laundry started and resupply at the local dollar general. There, our friends got to watch us hikers in our natural environment- sitting on curb sides with bags of food, ripping open all of it and repackaging it into freezer bags, and then somehow fitting all three full bags of food into one bag that would go into our packs. I'm glad Diana at least seemed intrigued with watching us while we scrambled to get chores done with friends around. Once finished, we hopped into the car and went to change the laundry over and then go get pizza. J&D treated us to pizza and trooper got appetizers and we all chatted and occasionally listened to political positions. We finished eating and got our laundry and headed back to the trail for our 8 mile hike to the only camping area in the next 23 miles. At the drop off point, Diana tried on my pack while the guys peeped their feet for hiking. we said our goodbyes and took off. There were a few steep climbs and two Rock mazes followed by the start of an 18 mile stretch of flat farm land walking. We found the campsite which already had a tent set up in it and we set up near by. Afterwards, we walked over to the town where they had a pool that allowed you to pay 2$ to use the shower. We didn't have high expectations but it was much worse than expected. There was only one shower in the woman's room and it had only a clear shower curtain. Not only was there no privacy in the shower, the hot water did not work. In addition, a young teenage boy was in the woman's room with his large family, all of them talking loudly and yelling at each other. And on top of that, none of the bathroom stalls locked or had any toilet paper. So I took my freezing cold shower in my clothes while a little boy looked on and pandemonium rang around me and I paid money for it. I came out when I was done and apparently the men's room wasn't much better, with both toilets clogged and again cold water. With the support of storm trooper, we approached the girl running the front desk and I asked for my money back. Yes it was only 2$ but as she apologized she suggested that these issues were known and that they just hadn't gotten around to fixing these problems. It was frustrating but came away slightly less salty. We were able to get back to camp and make a fire and dinner and settle in for the night. We are camped next to train tracks where there are frequent passings by the train as well as fairly constant fireworks going off for Fourth of July weekend.

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540784,"Day 84- July 4, 2016After a long nite of trains passing by our campsite, it was 5:45am and time to get up. Dregs and I had had a talk last night about some of the struggles I've been having with, as being accustomed to my independence, always being at the mercy of the people around me. When we wake up and go to bed, how long it'll take to get moving, how many breaks throughout the day, when we will spend money on extra treats, when we have to take a day off or cut miles or make miles and so on- everything is dependent on the actions and desires of other people and It builds to be trying for me. After the conversation, he took to heart what I had said so in the morning, he did what I've always asked- wake up and start getting ready so we can be out by 7am. We packed up and were able to be ready to go before 7. After talking to cat skinner and dragonfly, we were able to peel away from the conversation and head towards town. Trooper convinced us to stop in at a cafe- he's a bad influence on our treat habits- and we grabbed some coffee. As a part of last nights conversation, I had also mentioned feeling like I'm always the bad guy when I have to remind dregs we are on a budget. We allowed ourselves some good coffee but resisted getting breakfast like storm trooper. Once fully caffeinated, we had a 16 mile flat hike- flattest terrain yet. It weaved through narrow woods and along cornfields and I listened to the many interesting topics that dregs and trooper conversed over. We made it to a creek where we would get water for the night as it started to trickle rain. After hiking 20 miles already today, tent spots at the stream were taken, and knowing that up the next hill would be very rocky, we decided to make camp back up the trail the way we had come. We settled into an unused dirt road and just as everything was set up, the rain picked up. It was only about 3:30pm when we got into camp but we had made big miles and felt satisfied with our time and distance. A nice relaxing afternoon is also well appreciated. Trooper still made his nightly camp fire in the rain and we hung out after eating dinner.","boiling springs, PA

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541657,"Day 85- July 5, 2016We woke up a little late on the service road this morning. After raining all night, our tent was drenched and most of our stuff was damp and dingy. We packed up and set out to top off our water at the spring as there is no water for the first 11 miles of the day. After filling up and making some pack adjustments, we climbed a hill to where part of the famous PA rocks start. T wasn't as bad as expected but the real bad rocks aren't supposed to happen for another few days. A lot of the day was flat but it had its challenges. At one point there was a steep descent that was made up of large boulder steps at varying uncomfortable levels and angles which caused a few scary ankle rolls and a feeling of vertigo as I almost tumble forward down the remaining 100 feet. That may be a bit of an exaggeration, but it was slow going and annoying. At another point, the trail turned from the path that continued on straight. Instead of going straight, the AT was poorly routed to look like a side trail that went straight up a hill rather than continue down the expected rout. This looked odd to me, but I wasn't fooled. Storm trooper on the other hand missed the turn and kept walking down a mountain. When he realized his mistake, he ran back up the mountain trying to make up for lost time. In his effort to get back, he apparently missed the turn again and walked until cat skinner and dragonfly saw him hiking the wrong way and made a comment about his directionality. Luckily, we all made it into the town of Duncannon, PA where we resupplied at a gas station and continued on. Leaving the town, we ran into sidewinder, a hiker we met on the first day at springer mountain. Dregs and sidewinder talked as we hiked. We went over a bridge before the climb and could see right to the bottom where rock plates jutted at an angle from the river bottom. I couldn't help but be amazed at how it looked just like the mountains we climb and the rock formations that are so high up, yet these were at the bottom of a river. It was beautiful. After that, we had another long section of flat, yet that was the point in which I felt a twinge of pain develop on my lower shin. It felt as if I spontaneously generated a bruise on my shin and each step got more painful. Later, dregs and trooper decided it is probably shin splints and showed me some stretches I can do to help it heal. We had gotten water earlier and filled to capacity so that we could make it another 7 miles to where we would camp. Eventually we made it there, a camp site right after a shelter with no water. The guys made a fire and dregs burnt his incense he had gotten earlier. It was fairly late, about 6:45pm, so we ate and went in for the night.   ","somewhere, PA

Ninja Roll and Crash were up early and they started hiking before we even had the tent put away. We made decent time and left camp at 715. After an uneventful morning of hiking we came to a place where someone had used the ample available rocks to make chairs with backs. We had a nice lunch in the comfortable stone chairs. We saw tons of people on the trail in the afternoon. Not long before our last water stop of the day we all saw a little rattlesnake on the side of the trail. A bit later chicken hawk saw another much larger snake. There was confusion at the end of the day as we entered Swatara State park. A sign indicated there was no camping. This was unfortunate because we were at about 20 miles and ready to find camp. Luckily we stumbled across a whole group of folks breaking the rules including False Top and Charge. We ate with them and some new faces and everyone went to bed early. The site also had a creek next to it so we all washed in the creek. 22.7 miles for the day","campsite after shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541659,"Day 87- July 7, 2016We woke up on time this morning as all of the rest of the people at the camping area still had not stirred. As we climbed out of our tent to get our wet clothes from yesterday's sweat, Nemo came flying by hiking at his typical break neck speed. We had thought the eccentric man was far in front of us, but knowing he had a thing for staying in towns, we weren't that surprised. He recognized us and excitedly greeted us and briskly continued on. After the unexpected encounter, we packed up and readied our gear as to make it possible for me to hike my pace all day and get to camp with the ability to set up the full tent and have clean water. That involved swapping some clothes and the cook set for the tents rain fly and some iodine tablets. People started to wake up and by the time most people were up, we were ready to go. Dregs and I took off together despite our plan to hike separately. It was great getting to hike with him alone, not that trooper is bad company, but we were able to joke and laugh in a way that isn't shared with others, just between us. I have missed being a duo rather than a trio and this morning reminded me of the awesome way we are together. As we hiked, we came to a bench before a road and bridge that had a cooler sitting on it. I immediately guessed it would be empty or full of trash, but it was worth looking anyway. Inside was two ice cold cherry Pepsi's and an orange crush left. Dregs and I promptly drank the pepsi's and texted trooper to tell him about the last soda. As we continued on up the trail, we reached an intersection between the trail and a road with a small parking lot. In the parking lot, there was an older couple set up under a tent with tons of food and drinks. We sat with some other hikers, including Norway, and ate ham and pancakes. Second round of food was a queso blanco broccoli cheddar pasta dish that was incredible. We ate two bowls of that and trooper finally caught up with us. We each had a few sodas and cookies as well as grabbed some water, ziplock bags, and got a charge on our phones. It was great and the people hosting it were super sweet. After about an hour there, we decided to keep hiking. We made it to the 501 shelter that had a cold shower that still felt amazing. After rinsing off all of the salt that incrusted us, Nemo showed up. He must have took a long break somewhere for us to get a head of him but who knows what happened. He chatted with us for a bit and told us that he took about two weeks off the trail as well as some how pulling a 54 mile day at one point. That is a ridiculous amount of miles to hike in one day... Anyhow, we left the shelter, dregs, myself and trooper, and started making plans to see finding dory in the next town we come to. PA got very rocky and it caused me to roll my ankle and strain my shin splint. It was a rough last few miles but we made it to a campsite where little bear, ten bear, sukie, false top and charge all also ended up. Pace passed by and we chatted with him before he moved on and then we all ate dinner around a fire that trooper set up. It was a good 18 mile day but I'm glad to be going to bed.","camp after shelter

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541750,"Day 88 July 8thDregs here, We woke up at our site just past hertline campsite. Everyone there had the same free campsite in port Clinton PA in mind as their destination. The forecast called for storms at 3 pm. The town was about 19 miles away and I figured we could get to camp dry and not get caught in a storm. Chicken Hawk was sure that we would not make it....Soon after we began hiking there was a bit of a climb. We caught a couple of hikers who would be vying for our campsite and passed them. This would be a non issue because of all the space in town. After that it was flat for the rest of the way to a very very steep down hill. The steep down hill was another reason to hurry because rain could make it tricky. The racing to our destination was mostly uneventful except for when I almost stepped on a rattlesnake. As we approached town it began to drizzle. The descent into Port Clinton didn't fail to impress us with it's steepness. It was a very good thing to get down before it got muddy. StormTrooper got a room at the Port Clinton hotel and we set up in the free pavilion. Trooper let us use his shower and join in his load on the laundry machine. We all had a huge dinner at bar of the hotel restaurant. We walked the 1/4 mile to the pavilion where tents had previously been huddled to hide from the storm. Since then most of the tents were down in the grove. Only Brian a very talkative section hike was still there. Bedtime was the usual 930. All was well until 1230 when some drunk hikers got back from the bar and were loud enough to wake us up. Chicken Hawk charged right out and asked them all nicely to keep at down. Very surprisingly they did!","...

After that we walked over to the barbershop on the advice of some other hikers looking for someone who might be able to give us a ride into the larger city of Hamburg. It was there and we met Steve who agreed to take us to Hamburg for a price that wasn't too bad. Are initial plan was to try and take public transportation from there to Reading PA with the intent of seeing Finding Dory. We were able to negotiate a ride to and from the theater from Steve. It was really awesome to see a movie that we had all been looking forward to seeing.We caught a ride back to the super Walmart and did our usual shopping for resupply. We also bought some food to eat for lunch and dinner and then caught a ride back with Steve. It had been storming most of the day but it didn't stop us from getting our errands done. It's much nicer to be in town and dry on a rainy day. We sat in troopers hotel room and packed up our food bags and worked on budget stuff. We also had our dinner in the room and then after that joined trooper at the bar. Before it got dark we took our stuff back to the pavilion and campsite and set up in the grass far away from any possible drunk people and had an awesome night sleep.","port clinton, PA

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541753,"Day 90- July 10, 2016We woke up this morning in a soggy tent though it had not rained during the night. We camped in a field across from a pavilion where others had tented to stay dry, and we were inconveniently drenched in condensation. It was fine though, we packed up and as we did so, a man with a pointer dog showed up. We chatted with him as I hurriedly tried to get ready so that we could meet trooper for coffee at a barber shop before heading out of town. As we got walking his way, he sent us a message with the news that the shop was closed because it was Sunday. We disappointedly met up and started out days hike. Today was much more hilly than the previous day's in PA have been. After a long steep climb, we made our way through some boulder fields and on to a few overlooks. We ran into The KiD and his hiking companions at an overlook as well as some day hikers who chatted with us. After moving on, a day hiker with a vizsla walked by. Me being me, I excitedly asked the lady questions about her dog. Trooper finally got to see in person what a vizsla was after the many times I have talked about them. Down the trail we came across the KiDs dad and grandpa who had set up trail magic coolers at a road. We sat with a group of hikers and drank cold sodas and ate frozen three musketeers bars. It was delightful. Once we left, it was time to get water and then find a home. At the water source, I went ahead to scout out a near by campsite. On my way back I tripped and fell head first towards a tree. Luckily, my head missed the tree and only my hand scraped by as my shin landed on a raised root. It hurt fiercely for a bit and then was less painful. I hobbled back to the guys and announced that I had done something bad. They checked out my already swollen leg and confirmed that the bruise would be nasty. Currently, the spot on my leg is swollen on a space about the size of my hand with fingers together. We made it to a spot to camp and set up, made dinner and a fire, and the three of us hung out until dark. Hopefully my body does some recovering over night on my shin splints on one leg and a large welt on the other. 17 miles today","port clinton

The day was supposed to be mostly flat but the rocks got worse. Periodically there were very cumbersome bolder fields. After sitting down for a break and checking our guidebook a plan was struck. There was a restaurant at a road crossing that we needed to go to for water anyways, we were going to eat lunch!Not too much longer after that we came to the road crossing and headed towards the only building in sight. A foreboding feeling crept over us as we crossed the empty parking lot. Sure enough it was closed on Mondays. We made our way around back to get water from the faucet and had lunch there with roadrunner. After lunch the hiking was easy until we came to a section called the knifes edge. The ridge we were walking on became a spine of jagged rocks with cool views to one side. It would have actually been fun if our feet weren't hurting from the day of rocks. In the early evening I put headphones in to distract me from the foot pain. With loud music going and not a care in the world I passed gas. This is not something that would normally make the journal but on this occasion a hiker I had never met was just about to pass me....Thankfully he had a smirk on his face as he passed.....A bit later this hiker stopped for water at a shelter. I know this because less than an hour after my first impression fart I again tooted as this mystery hiker was nearing me to pass. He had no smile that time....Not my best and brightest moment.As evening approached we found a great ridgeline campsite with chairs made out of rocks. It came with a fire pit and a nice view! There were also some berry bushes too! Everything was great until I started to get sick and couldn't eat my meal. Not good. 21 miles hiked","camp

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544060,"Day 92- July 12, 2016We left our beautiful campsite that was surrounded by berries and overlooked the town and headed towards our biggest climb of PA. It wasn't long before we arrived at a small shelter where we would get our last water for the next 16 miles. At the shelter, a south bound couple talked to us about the climb we were about to do. The lady with the short bright pink hair told us that coming down the mountain of boulders was hell but she had been told by other nobo hikers that the climb up was fun. Our challenge would be increased by the fact that Dregs was not feeling well and hadn't eaten anything for dinner last night or breakfast this morning. Additionally, we would have to carry full water from the lack of sources down trail and the tough climb, rated a 9 by the ATC, would be fully exposed to the hot sun. After collecting our water, we set out to climb. We got to the road where we saw the mountain side. The rock face we would be climbing was obvious. We started up the mountain and I was impressed with the trails steepness. I let dregs go ahead of me as I slowly made my way up. Even with his discomfort and lack of food, he trucked on up. After a short bit of dirt trail, it turned to large boulders with hard to see white blazes painted on to show the way. At one point, I looked behind myself at the view of the bridge water and road below. I got slightly dizzy and reminded myself not to do that again. I put my trekking poles away and continued to climb. Until I hit a wall. It was only a few feet taller than I am but the rocks that most people use to climb up were small and too high for me to pull my feet up on to. In addition, it was positioned in a way that while hanging on, I would be leaning backwards towards the steep boulder field behind me. With my fear of heights, tired body, heavy pack, full water, shin splints, other shin bruised, and a backward slanting wall that I needed to climb, I did my best to try to get up. It didn't work. Dregs was just over the wall above me and could see my growing frustration and fear. As I dangled on a small foothold, I feared I was stuck with no way up or down and my arms getting tired of holding the weight forward. Dregs tried to assist me with his hand but I didn't trust I wouldn't pull him down or that I wouldn't be dropped. I slowly lowered myself back to a flat spot and took off my pack. Dregs climbed to a point where I was able to lift my pack to him and he hoisted it up and over. Then, I took a moment to gain the courage to try another rout to climb up. With the dwindling strength I had left, I made it up. Dregs gave me a hug and we continued up. As we crested a mound of rocks, storm trooper snapped a picture of us. It was a long trek up more boulders and then through desertous areas. Along the trail, berry bushes began to pop up everywhere and we lost trooper to a few bushes of raspberries and dew berries. We eventually met back up for lunch and continued on. I ran out of water about 6 miles before the next water source that wasn't .6 off the trail. Trooper gave me the remainder of his extra water so that we could make it. It was a long 18 miles we hiked to the shelter but when we arrived, we found a great camp spot far from day hikers and it had flat ground and lots of sitting space around a fire pit. The guys went down to replenish water and I was to set up sleeping pads, filter water, gather fire wood, start the fire and make dinner while they were gone. I made it a personal challenge to have it all done by the time they got back because they didn't think I could do it all. I proved them wrong, but in the process of collecting wood, a swarm of ants started walking up my arm and biting me. I had a bit of a freak out and got them off of me. They returned and we had a good time before heading in for bed. Dregs still wasn't feeling good but did eat some food.","

Day 94- July 14, 2016We were late this morning to meeting trooper at the dunkin doughnuts before getting back to the trail. Dregs was still not feeling well and I had not gotten a great night sleep. We did make it there eventually yet when we went to order, our credit card was denied. I checked our balance on my phone and it looked like nothing strange was happening. Dregs called the card company and found out that a few weeks ago they had sent a letter to our house informing us that due to a security breach, our card would be deactivated and replaced. Go figure they only sent a letter to our home while we were on a thru hike. No call or email about our money source no longer working. Either way, dregs was able to convince the guy on the phone to overnight us a new card. This would mean that we would be taking two more half days of hiking in order to be in the next town where the card would be. With that situation figured out, we set out to find a hitch back to the trail. We stood out on a corner near a road for 20 minutes watching all of the large SUVs and trucks pass us by unwilling to even look our way. I tried doing a little dance and singing, but nothing got their attention. Eventually, a couple drove up to is in an orange element. The man said that him and his wife had been watching us from the Wendy's across the street where they were having breakfast. They said they were surprised that with all the vans and large cars going by, none of them had stopped. They helped us load our packs into the car and drove us the two miles up to the trail head. We were thankful that this couple helped us out! It would be our final full day in PA and the rocks were said to be the worst here. We headed up the only hill of the day and not long after were met by the trail of rocks and boulders. Dregs checked the whether and saw that it was supposed to rain. We booked it to a near by shelter and waited out a severe thunderstorm with trooper, karma, and a few other hikers. Once the rain stopped, we slowly made our way through the wet rocks and at one point, we got to a section of large slippery boulders that are probably the most dangerous surfaces we've faced. Toward the end of our day, dregs got stung by a bee as we apparently walked through a swarm. PA just had to throw in a thunderstorm and angry bees before we left. We finally made it the 16 miles to Delaware Water Gap where we heard a church would be doing a hiker feed as well as had a hostel and tenting area. The people there were super friendly and many of the congregation showed up for the potluck. They brought hotdogs, corn, Mac n cheese, beans, coleslaw, salad, desserts and much more. They said a group welcome and prayer before letting the 17 hikers grab food first with the congregation following. We all sat at tables together and shared our journeys with the people of the church. It was a really cool way they have connected with this hiker community. After dinner, we showered up and dregs went to hang out with trooper and stick, who had just hiked 30 miles to catch us. It's been a good day and we are happy to be out of PA.","

We left the beautiful park with a lake and started our 12 mile hike to the bear mountain inn. It was a relatively easy day that was still plagued with short but steep ups and downs. We reached a mountain top where suddenly dregs pointed out into the distance. There, we could see the faint outline of the New York City skyline. Dregs sat stunned by NY city skyline and we decided to call aunt Kim who we wanted to visit. We were able to set up a plan to meet her at the inn and spend the evening with the other half of our NY family.

We crossed out of the zoo and made our way over the bear mountain bridge and up the next mountain. About a quarter way through our day, we arrived at a shell station where we found storm trooper waiting for us. We ate frozen coffee drinks and had some snacks before the three of us pressed on. We hiked a total of 15.5 miles and ended up making camp at a dispersed camp site right after a small shed that had a water faucet. At the shed, we met an older thru hiker and his golden retriever, Theo, who had hiked the whole trail up to this point including the smokies. Back at camp, we set up and ate.

It was a hot and humid day and ny has not had the best water sources. Dregs and I had decided that in order to make the day manageable, we would walk at a nice slow pace of 2mph over the course of our 11 hour hiking day and taking short breaks. Of course, as soon as we started hiking with dregs in the lead, he took off and hiked briskly up and down hills. Luckily the terrain was easy rolling and twisting hills so it wasn't too straining. A few times, I tried to remind dregs of our easy pace, but after 10 minutes or so he would pick his pace up again. I felt really good after a great night sleep and the light breeze that came through every now and then. We came to a road crossing and right off the trail was the Dover Oak, the largest oak tree on the AT. Under the tree, a man was set up with camp chairs and coolers filled with cold drinks. I grabbed a Gatorade and some cookies and again reminded dregs of the short breaks, especially because we had a resupply and lunch in a mile. It was a quick but appreciated break and the drinks were wonderful. We hiked to a food truck for lunch and were excited to get some real food and resupply before heading out to keep to our short break plan. When we got there, there were at least 8 other hikers in line and some locals. We stood in line in the blazing heat on our achy feet for 40 minutes waiting to order. I stopped thinking it was worth the pain and heat about 10 minutes in, but dregs and trooper were committed. We slowly got more and more displeased with the situation and even more frustrated when a local got in line and the lady working took her order and had it ready before they got to us, who were in front of the local lady. The meal was alright, I got a cheese steak sandwich. Dregs and trooper really liked their meals. We were there for two hours and I was annoyed, hot, itchy, and in pain. Not to mention we were only supposed to be there for 30 minutes or so and needed to resupply. I gave up on the resupply and was told it was expensive anyway. We hiked on when we were finished, into multiple fields. With the blazing hot sun, I hiked as fast as I could to get to the shaded woods. Once under the canopy of trees, my mood lightened and got into a little better mood. It was a great rest of the afternoon and we made it into camp at 4:55pm. After grabbing our tent sites and taking a washcloth bath from the water pump, I jumped in the tent and the guys stayed out and were approached by a few other hikers. They talked and I lay on the tent writing. 18.6 mile day.","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544071,"Day 106- July 26, 2016After a long and restful night, I put on my wet clothes and climbed out of the tent into swarming misquotes. As the three of us worked to get ready for the day, we were bitten up and constantly swatting at our faces and legs. Once out and moving, the cool morning air was delightful. The rain from yesterday really cooled down the temperature and made for pleasant walking and talking. We moved fairly quickly as we headed towards Falls Village, CT where we would pick up a package. We lost trooper for a bit as dregs and I got confused by the map of the town, but found him up trail a bit after a river walk. We got into town where we got our package containing new shoes for dregs, a pack towel, and gators for the both of us. We met back up with trooper on the porch of a closed inn and ordered pizza. Somehow trooper convinced a lady at the store across the street to give him the key to the fire house so he could use the bathroom. Dregs and I got a text from him in the firehouse bathroom with a fireman hat on... After our time in town, we headed up towards a view of a waterfall. I began to get mid day cranky and heat/sun angry. Dregs and trooper were able to help me reason my way into a better mood, that we only had 8 miles, plenty of time, could doddle and still make the shelter by 6. We chatted with a southbound hiker for a bit at a stream and could tell he missed being around people as our group joked and laughed together. Not far after, We found a view of mountains that, though it was at an open field, it was better than most vistas we come to. We took a break there and then headed on. The terrain wasn't bad and the temperature was not as hot. We restocked on water and did the final climb of the day. It wasn't bad and we made it to the shelter. At the shelter, there was a beautiful view that we ate dinner at. A hiker we met in the Shenandoah's, moss man, showed up and we chatted with him while we ate. The misquotes were even worse here so after eating we quickly retreated to our tent. 18.9 miles today","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544072,"Day 107- July 27, 2016It's hard to be out here. It's hard to get all of our chores done before going to bed at night, I am tired from a long day of constant hiking in the hot humid sun, only to arrive at camp and have to set up a tent, unpack, change clothes, make dinner, and write a journal so I don't forget the at that seems to blend into all others all the while being bitten by mosquitos. It's hard to sleep. The humidity congeals onto myself, my sleeping pad, my pillow, and my husband who wants me to cuddle with him as we are both sticky and hot and I can't help but to turn away. It's hard to wake up in the morning, knowing that I have to poke and prod dregs to get up so we can get up and out on time so that we can hike all day so that we can get to camp at a reasonable time so that we can get our chores done so that we can go to bed so that we can do it all over again the next day. The mornings are hard because I didn't get a good night sleep and I went to bed later than planned and I wake up earlier than necessary because the people I hike with take longer to get ready than I do but won't wake up unless I get them up. It's hard to hike all day. In the morning you feel good for the first climb but try not to think how many more climbs will fill your day, otherwise it is discouraging and seems like another monumental task that you must continually undertake. It is hard hiking with other people. It is rare that you can hike your own pace and must always be conscious of that pace because others are affected by it, whether it's too fast or too slow. Going up a mountain too fast wears you down quickly and going up too slow is equally as exhausting. It is nearly impossible to zone out and get lost in your own thoughts when another is there because they are either talking or you're trying to be aware of them in case they say something or need pace adjustments. It's hard to take breaks when you don't want them and to not take them when you do. It is hard to walk in the cold rain that affects you for the rest of the day and brings blisters to your feet and makes rocks and roots slippery. It is hard to walk in the blistering sun on a humid day where there is little water and bugs swarming around your eyes and ears all day long, only to get to camp and be damp from sweat, unable to dry because of humidity, attacked by mosquitos and needing to get all of our chores done so we can go to bed at a reasonable time and try to sleep on the damp sleeping pad. It is hard to do this day in and day out and constantly be at the mercy of others while dealing with constant discomfort and energy draining activities, but at the end of the day, I was in the beautiful wilderness with the love of my life and a good friend, building our relationships and challenging ourselves. I'm learning to trust my husband more and seeing how wonderful and encouraging he is to me always. I'm learning a lot about my limits and how those limits are actually pretty flexible. I've learned that at any moment the tables can be turned and a bad moment can turn into trail magic. And I've learned that yesterday's rain is dryer up and forgotten in today's sun. We crossed into Massachusetts today after climbing mt Everett, which a sobo hiker had compared to the whites, and trooper and dregs swam in a waterhole. After an 18 mile day, we made it into a town where we watched Star Trek Beyond 3D and tented on the lawn of a community center which provided showers. It turned out to be a good day.","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544073,"Day 108- July 28, 2016 We grabbed a cab out of town and were dropped off back at the trail. First thing in the morning, we had eaten breakfast at McDonald's and resupplied. We planned on hiking until 6 as usual and aimed for an 18 mile day. It was a decent day of hiking, not too tough but I can tell that we are moving up and down mountains more than the previous states. We got water early at a shelter where we found our friends Stick and Sidewinder. After hanging out for a bit and eating lunch there, we continued on. We made it to our destination campsite at exactly 6pm. A large group of middle school aged boys had taken over the campground which worried us. They were loud for a bit but eventually calmed down. It is supposed to rain all night and some of the boys forgot their rainfly... It will be interesting to hear their reaction to getting rained on through their tent. We ate dinner with trooper, stick, sidewinder and a man named Steve who plans on doing the trail next year. Dregs and trooper enjoyed relaying all of their tips tricks and suggestions to the man. The mosquitos are huge and plentiful here, so I went into the tent early. Almost ready for bed.","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544074,"Day 109- July 29, 2016We woke up to rain that had settled down sense the night time. I packed up all of my things while still inside the tent as dregs and trooper harassed me about having to come out into the rain sooner or later. By the time I came out, the rain had almost stopped. Steve, the guy testing his gear for next years thru hike, asked us if he could start the day with us as he wanted to pick our brains about the hike. He kept pace with us up two mountains before needing to slow down and let us leave him behind. We continued on hiking as the day got more and more sunny with blue skies. With everything still wet from the rain, I slipped and fell three times. Lucky I did not get injured. I felt good today, like my Virginia blues that didn't start until PA and continued until CT, finally has really started to subside. We ate lunch at a picnic table near a pond at an inn that sold sodas and continued on our way. Steve had caught up while we took our lunch, so we were able to chat again with him as we passed by. It was fairly flat with minor ups and downs for the mid and latter part of the day. Before setting out to find camp, we stopped by the cookie lady's house. It was a blueberry farm that the owners welcomed hikers to and provided cookies for. We saw crash and ninja roll leaving and another group of thru hikers we didn't know. Unfortunately, the elderly lady who owned the farm didn't realize we were new people who had just arrived, so we didn't get any cookies. However, dregs, trooper and I were able to pick a gallon of blueberries for only 6$. It was more blueberries than I could ever Handel, but it was fun and they were delicious! We set out to look for home after, intending to only go another mile or so. We haven't seen much dispersed camping in a long time, so we were lucky to find a spot almost two miles further. After making a fire to control the mass amount of mosquitos and eat dinner, we retreated to our tents. It was a 23 mile day","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548128,"Day 110- July 30, 2016We woke up early to get to town before the post office closed. It was Saturday so it closed at 12 and we had 8 miles to walk. I was getting destroyed by mosquitos so I left before the guys. With my music on, I briskly walked. I got to town by 9:50am, plenty of time. As I passed a sub shop, I saw ninja roll and crash. I left my pack with them and headed over to the postoffice. Once I got our package with our warranty replacement parts for our trekking poles, I went back to the sub shop and hung out with the guys until dregs and trooper showed up. We ate some great steak subs and filled up on coffee from the cafe next door. Trooper got a room at an inn and we went over there to do laundry and shower. We lounged around for a good long while before dregs and I headed out to the woods. We walked about a mile on the trail through a neighborhood and parked ourselves just outside of town in a pine forest. It was supposed to rain at 8pm so we quickly got our chores done and cooked dinner in the tent vestibule. I got attacked by mosquitos and hid in the tent. We hung out for a bit before the rain started and then went to bed. In the morning we would need to make it to another town to meet aunt Becky and Julia!","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548129,"Day 111, July 31We awoke along side the trail just outside of Dalton to a slight rain. We packed up as quickly as we could and started the climb over Crystal mountain. It rained pretty hard but the climb was gradual and easy enough. We made it into Cheshire with a bit of time to spare which was perfect because as we walked down a quaint residential street we were called over to a crowded carport. They was a nice family cooking breakfast for hikers! And it was amazing! Chicken Hawk and I ate our fill and pushed on into town where we're going to be met by my aunt Becky and cousin Julia! They had no trouble finding us and we drove to the trailhead to meet a trailing Storm Trooper.Even though it was still raining a bit, Becky and Julia wanted to do a bit of hiking so we left Chicken Hawk in the car and walked into the woods to meet our hiking companion. After a half mile we came across trooper and headed back down to the warm car. We had a couple hours to kill before we could check into the Air B&B that Becky and Julia had rented for the night. We found a nice diner in North Adams called Izzy's where we spent the next couple hours. The food was great and they even had a life sized Darth Vader that Storm Trooper had a moment with. On our way back to Adams where our new home there was was an outfitter. Our gracious hosts stopped there for us and we were able to get our trekking poles fixed. The last stop before check in was a a trip to the grocery store for more food for dinner. This was the perfect opportunity to resupply for us. We finally all arrived at a great little place with a cloud obscured view of Mt Greylock. We hung our tent and wet clothes to dry and had some showers and relaxation. We hung out for a bit and then had an absolutely wonderful meal cooked by Aunt Becky. The rest of the event was spent hanging out and having dessert. It was a truly great day!","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548130,"Day 112- August 1, 2016This morning I got to have a real cup of coffee and a fresh apple as I headed out to read my new Harry Potter book on the porch while all but myself and trooper slept. As soon as I was about to sit down, the owner of the Bnb jumped up from his side of the porch and started asking me a million questions about the trail. Trooper say inside listening and chuckling as I answered the typical list of questions. I was able to get some reading in and a few cups of coffee before dregs, Becky and Julia got up. Once everyone was awake, we packed up and went to a breakfast spot called the daily grind. I ate a large veggie omelette with home fries, bacon, and toast. It was great but very filling. After breakfast we were dropped off to start our 11 mile hiking day. It was raining all day as we climbed up Mt graylock. With my full belly and town accustomed feeling, I did not enjoy the climb. It was a constant climb for about 5 miles, I felt nauseous, felt dizzy from not wearing my glasses, cold and wet. Dregs worked hard to help me keep my spirits up and not to crash. We did make it all the way up though, and it seemed to not feel as strenuous. We caught up to trooper at a beautiful pond with a cabin near the top of the mountain surrounded by pine trees and misty fog. It looked like a scene from a move or a painted picture. We continued on to the summit where the fog had whited out any view of anything and it began to rain more. We made it down the mountain to a shelter where we pitched our tent as the sun came out for the first time today. My spirit was much higher than it had been earlier in the day and we were able to get all chores done quickly. I crawled into our tent and read my book while dregs and trooper hung out outside. Tonight will rain again and will be cold. Hopefully tomorrow is a better day.","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548131,"Day 113- August 2, 2016It pored rain all night. We woke up to our tent filled with water that had gotten on our tent foot print which then soaked through the bottom of the tent. Our blankets and sleeping pads were drenched and it was cold. Dregs recommended we wait another 30 minutes or so to see if the rain slowed or stopped before getting out and dealing with the situation. We waited and soon enough, the rain stopped. We did our best to clean up the water but knew it would be something to deal with later at camp. It was cold out but the rain was not supposed to start up again. Dregs and I left before trooper and walked for a little while with a section hiker who yesterday briefly thought I was storm troopers son... He was a really nice guy who had thru hiked in '93 and we walked to the bottom of a large mountain with him. There, we found trail magic of Gatorade and bananas and trooper caught up to us. We continued on through a town and then up a fairly long and steep climb. At about 8 miles for the day we crossed into Vermont. I was really excited and so was dregs. It's amazing to me that we have walked from Georgia to Vermont, 113 days out here, and only 3 states left to hike. What an accomplishment. I really feel that God had been guiding our journey and bringing about the success that we've seen. After eating lunch at a huge boulder, we hiked on to a shelter to find camp. It was a 17 mile day. We found a cozy corner of camp ground across the river from the shelter and apparently the tent sites on the other side filled up quick and are crowded. Trooper made a fire with wet sticks and we were able to hang up all of our wet gear to dry. Dregs found a rock in his pack that trooper had put in there as a joke. It was a shrink wrapped rock form a coffee shop we had recently been to and on the back it said ""friends "". Dregs was not amused at first but it was hilarious. He will carry the rock to ME. After eating, two hikers came over to find a spot. Lucky us, it was crash and ninja roll! We ended the day with dregs hanging out talking to our friends and I read my book and relaxed.","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548133,"Day 114 Friday August 3thThe first thing I saw when I stuck my out of my tent was Vera sleeping outside right by the scenic view. I was very impressed, I have not yet cowboy camped and I'm not sure if I am brave enough. We all slowly packed up and walked the mostly flat 5 miles to the road where we would hitchhike into town for resupply. We ran into Stick at the trailhead parking lot. He was leaving town and saying goodbye to a friend from home that he had been hiking with. They had already sorted out a ride to town for Sticks friend to use so we hopped in. The ride was from the towns hostel owner. He dropped us of in Manchester Center by the grocery store. Our plan was a little different this time. We wanted to eat lunch first and give our food time to digest before we headed back out to hike. After much pleading from Stormtrooper we decided to get Thai food. There was a couple of hours to kill before it opened so we started the rest of our errands. First up was Starbucks to charge up our brains and our phones. Next we spent quite a bit of money at the outfitters. After a short walk we arrived at a restaurant called Thai Basil. The food was excellent! On our way to resupply we got bagels at a nice local place because they were there. Finally we made it to the grocery store and left with 3 more days of food. We repackaged our meals and we're lucky enough to steal a ride from the hostel owner again. Thanks! Our planned 2 mile hike to the shelter went smoothly and it was a relaxing night at camp","

Dregs and Chicken Hawk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548132,"Day 115- August 4, 2016Today we left a noisy shelter site where it's over crowded area was filled with loud inconsiderate section hikers and some sobo. I left the guys, who were still packing up, so I could get walking while I had the energy. Dregs caught me quick because I had to keep making pack adjustments, but I soon got a lead on him from a long down hill. I hiked by myself most of the day, listening to my sword of truth book. I stopped at around 10:30am at a stream and footbridge with a camp site where I told dregs I would wait for him so we could get water for a large climb and eat lunch. It was much earlier than anticipated so I just waited for him and when he showed up, I consulted with him on our next stopping point. I left and headed up a beautiful mountain full of berch trees and pines, mossy boulders, ferns and all sorts of rich greens. It smelled incredible, like a fresh cut Christmas tree mixed with the freshest most pure air I've ever breathed. It was wonderful though the climb was long and in some parts steep. At the top, I came across a fire tower that I had promised dregs I would climb to the top of. I am so terrified of heights and have only made it to the top of one other towers that was not as high. Some section hikers encouraged me as I started the climb alone. Half way up, a couple came rushing up behind me. I stared at the floor board and let them pass as I clung for my life on a small beam. I waited there, unable to bear moving lest they need to squeeze by me or I feel pressured to move out of their way while they moved about. I waited until they decided to come down and then I continued my journey upwards. I had to keep telling myself they were normal stairs that I just needed to walk like any other. But then again, sometimes I slip down steps in normal life... That thought didn't help much but I kept going all the way up. Shaking, I crawled up into the top of the tower and quickly took some pictures and then sat on the floor. I heard from below me dregs call up asking I I was up there. I answered him and he came up to join me. It felt like an earthquake, him walking up, and it was terrifying. He reached the top and found me sitting on the floor holding on. He gave me encouraging words as I insisted that I go back down now. The hardest part is the first few steps going down. I turned around and stepped down as if I were climbing a ladder. Keeping my eyes focused on the steps, I made it all the way down. Very proud of myself. We ate lunch at the bottom and then I hiked on to our next meet up spot, a shelter. Once there, I got water from a pond and talked to a few other hikers, walked back up and dregs and trooper showed up not long after. We figured that only two more miles were necessary to make our goal into town tomorrow, but I ended up skipping the 2 mile camp site in hopes that there would be a good spot in another mile or so. There wasn't. It was 6 miles from the last shelter rather than 2 before there was any camping. I found a spot with a beautiful view of layering mountains. Trooper showed up and then dregs called me looking for us. He had though we went down to a shelter that was .5 off down a hill and was very upset when we weren't there. He made it to us later and then more hikers showed up. We all ate dinner as we watched an orange sunset. 21 miles","

Once on the trail, I felt energized and like I could hike fast all day. It was foggy as I made my way up a mountain where I passed many other hikers. It was beautiful being in a pine forest filled with fog. Trooper eventually caught up to me as I slowed before lunch and we decided to eat at a shelter 12.8 miles in for the day at only 12:30. Dregs showed up for lunch not long after and had with him two south bound hikers, butterfly and dragonfly. All of us chatted for a bit as a bit more rain suddenly came through. It passed shortly and then I took off to hike more. There was trail magic at a road crossing and I grabbed a Pepsi and a banana before trooper and I finished off the day of hiking. Only another 5 miles to make our 18 mile day. It was an easy hike and once at the shelter at a large pond, I dropped my pack and went on a quest to find better camping that we didn't have to pay for. I walked almost all the way around the large pond with no luck. I returned to the camp site and dregs had arrived. We made camp and washed up in the pond. Dinner was had and we payed our 10$ for our over crowded campsite. Overall it was a good day with 18 miles done by 3:50pm.","

We had only a little to me before we left to get dunkin doughnuts and make sandwiches to pack out for lunch. It was raining and we weren't excited to be leavening town so soon. Once on the trail, we each got into our rhythm of hiking. I listened to my book and took off from the group. I had slipped in the mud early on and was sad that my cleanness from town lasted almost no time out here. The time seemed to fly and before I knew it, it was 4:09pm and I had hiked 20 miles. At a shelter, I made camp and not long after dregs and trooper showed up. As we prepared for the evening, I was happy we finally got our winter gear back as I was cold from the rain and sweat the wouldn't seem to evaporate even after I had stopped hiking.
