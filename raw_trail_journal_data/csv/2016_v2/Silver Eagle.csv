Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522010,"First journal entry. I've been working on preparations for a section-hike to begin a multi-year thru hike. As a boy, I bagged many mid-Atlantic miles and much experience on the AT in Maryland and Virginia (it did not actually go into West Virginia in those days). Always had the desire to return, and the right circumstances have now come to pass. My life included a long career, and great children, and a wife with the patience of a saint. In 2014, we drove from our home in Florida and spent time in the mountains of NC and Virginia. When we later saw ""A Walk in the Woods"", she told me I should go for it. So, I'm going to section-hike annually while I'm still working, then finish off this piece I have left on my bucket list.","

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522024,"So, after my wife suggested a section-hike, I started planning for a (multi-year ) thru hike. I managed to schedule a 2 week vacation in May, and I figure I can cover ground well enough at my age to make it Franklin by the Friday of the 2nd week. We have a date, she will pick me up at Winding Stair Gap, and we have reservations at a favorite hotel nearby.Today, I did my third practice hike, 6.3 miles with 27 lb pack. I'll be ready; I usually get 5 miles a day hauling paint around my store, so no problem.","

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523350,"Earlier this week, son-in-law Eric insisted we find a camp spot where he and the kids, (my older grandchildren) could set up a base camp, let me do a loop hike with full pack, then return and set up my trail camp as if I was on the trail for real. Site selection was tricky with Daytona Bike Week taking over most of the state and national parks nearby, but we found great state forest an hour away with many miles of trails, and absolutely no by else here! Got in 6.5 miles in heavy heat, 80° plus, and lots of soft sand walking. Tough on the legs! Tent and rest of kit working well, but gotta work on some trail recipes, can't handle Knorr sides.

Silver Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527047,"Road trip! Cool day (long sleeves in Florida this morning?!). We decided that Pat would drive from Jax, through or around Atlanta, and on to Winding Stair Gap just using her iPhone GPS like she will the day she picks me up after I finish my section next month. She is the best, as always. We'll be celebrating our 42nd anniversary in June, and it's always been fun like this. Thank you, baby.","Jacksonville, FL

As near as I can tell, everything is ready, packed, reserved or planned. Sending my resupply box off while I am on my way to work, should be in Hiawassee before me. See you all on Springer Mtn on Monday morning!","Jacksonville, FL

I had no idea they stop at so many towns between Jax and Atlanta!   Hiker Hostel is a fantastic place, very much a home for hikers. They'll be dropping several of us at the trailhead tomorrow morning after breakfast, then I'm on my way Sitting in a bus all day almost busted my resolve, but no! I'm doing this.","
