Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522762,I've almost completed gathering/purchasing my supplies needed for this trip. I will make gear list entries soon. I initially intended to hike the entire trail to the end but that has changed. I'll only be able to hike for 30 days. I'm still going!! My departure date to drive from FL to ATLANTA is 28 March 2016. I plan to have boots on the trail NLT 3-30-16.,,View Entry,"Mar 07, Mon",0
Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523347,"Today 3-12-16, I finally broke in my new hiking boots! They've been a major pain but I've logged about 20 miles in them and the left boot finally stopped hurting my ankle! I have also found out that Amicalola Falls Lodge has long term parking. I'll be able to drive direct and not worry about where to store my bike. 2weeks till I depart for Amicalola Falls! I've got all my gear now and will start practice packing up and then unpacking and setting up tent and gear.","North from Springer Mtn

Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525130,"I have finally finished packing my backpack (and repacked, and repacked) and feel it is ready with everything I need for this hike. It is very difficult to pack for everything you think you ""need"" and then find the backpack is too heavy. I then had to unpack and re-evaluate what you can really do without and repack. I have everything loaded and ready to leave out early heading to Atlanta. I am looking forward to this adventure and hope that it is as I have imagined. I've spent several months preparing and reading and planning. I have walked / hiked almost 200 miles with my German Shepard, Ginger, in preparation for this hike. She has been a faithful companion that I will miss while I am away. I will try and update this journal daily as phone service will allow. I will also try to post pictures if I can figure out how!

Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525362,"I'm in camp ground tonight at Amicalola Falls State Park GA. All has gone well and I'm ready to hike tomorrow. I bought fuel for my stove and tried it out for first time. It works! Spilled a little fuel on picnic table and it caught fire. No biggy! Gathered wood from surrounding area and made nice fire tonight. I've gone through my back pack once again and culled more items to get my weight down to 28lbs. Amazing I can have all I need in one little BPK. Temps are expected to be in low 40's here tonight. My ""GOAL"" is to reach Hawk Mountain Camp tomorrow evening (approx 15mi). Tomorrow is suppose to be clear and mild. Expect rain tomorrow night late. Hawk Mtn has a shelter! Im ok! Good night All!","North from Springer Mtn

Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525518,"The mountain will make you earn every beautiful summit view and every easy walk across ridge tops as well as all the easy downhill walks!! The mountain will tell you exactly how old you are as well! Longer day than expected. Glad to be in a shelter tonight. Very windy and about 45deg. I slept in today and got late start 11am. 4 peeps in shelter. Most went to their tents. I'm doing fine. Feet are fine. Nice and warm in my gear. Saw a lot of random flowers trying to get spring going up here. Met many p on trail throughout the day. Ran out of water as I arrive at shelter. Used my filter to refill at stream. Great water. Trying not to use up phone pwr so may not respond to all text / ph calls. Will see how weather dictates the day tomorrow. We shall see said the ""Blindman ""! Good night.","North from Springer Mtn

Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525740,0930 hike from springer to hawk mt. Arrived 2pm. In light rain. Crashed at shelter. Rain hit hard as I slept. Got food and water.

No blisters no cramps. I'm good!! I'm going to bed now. Expecting lots of rain tonight and into the morning. So may be a late start to Gooch Gap!! Good night.

Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525952,"Very interesting trip. Once again traversing some intense trails that would turn back a few mountain goats!! On the uphill trek I go in 200ft intervals, find a fallen tree and rest 2 min then repeat. Such a relief to find the flat trail at top that leads to the decent!! Strength is very different than stamina and endurance. Lift all the weights you want but your only tasked for the monument. Walk 1000-2000 up a mountain in 1/4 to 1/2 mile, that's a different thing altogether!! As I crossed paths at top of sassafras Mtn an older lady said ""it's all downhill till the next mountain""- now that's a profound NS Mr. T. I'm still good on food. Water plentiful. At a crossroads several of us found 6 gal of water left by trail angels!! Fog was so thick yesterday evening vis was only 20ft. Tonight I cooked tuna in water with lemon juice and then spread on tortillas/wrap. Cup of hot green tea with peanut butter snack pac. The shelter host here has kept us all in stitches laughing. He's a clone to B. Bates!!Dougs SIL.   Going to lance creek sat then Neels Gap by Sunday. Still warm dry and no physical problems. All gear working great!! Crucial. Going to bed. Night to all. Sleeping in tent tonight. Low 40's. Hope to wake to sunshine!!","

Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526160,"Today was a really good day. Went to sleep w rain woke up to cold front and cool winds. Dry and warm again last night! Hot oatmeal with extra raisins and squirt of lemon juice!! Cup of hot green tea with pop tart! Got late start but made it to woody gap by 3:30. Had great reception from 12 tribes volunteer group.... Hot homemade tomato cream potato soup with some fancy green tea and fresh pumpkin bread!!!!! Took an hr break and head out to this camp - Lance Creek- settled in by 7. BEAUTIFUL overlooks as we crossed 2 small mountains. Hiking w ex marine and his friend from college station. Good guys. Lots of rain till today but managed to stay dry so far! Others not so lucky. Tomorrow we plan an early start to Neal's Gap. Steap rugged rocky terrain but the more food I eat the lighter my pack. Hiking sticks are essential to navigating the assents. Meeting some good people, funny people and a few odd ones..maybe I'm in the ""odd"" category of others assessment! Will try posting photos now with my last 24% of battery left.

Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526315,Had a cold night at Lance Creek. Winds gusted at 25+ knots over the top of the mountains that surrounded us. Thankfully we were several hundred feet down snug on hill side trail camp. Woke up ready to hike to top of blood mountain and finally to Neels Gap. At top of blood mountain we could see Atlanta about 60 miles away--YES we did!! Beautiful walk down the final 2.5 miles to Neels Gap. Had some welcomed snacks and my first shower!! Felt brand new! My two friends and I got a ride into Blaisville GA and had great dinner at Italian restaurant!! Getting a room for the night to recoup and rest. Will post more photos tonight. Thanks for all the messages in guest book and all your encouragement!!,"Neals Gap

Blind Man ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526755,"I've decide to end here on a good note and start heading home. It's been great and awesome experience. Have had zero problems of any kind. I have also met some great people that I got an opportunity to hike with along the way. Just wanted to take a little of this time off and spend with family also. 4-4-16 I'm heading back up hill to Neels Gap and will get a ride back to Amicalola Falls from there. The Appalachian Mountain Trail will always be here waiting. Thanks again for the notes of encouragement!""Blindman""",,Done for now,"Apr 07, Thu",0
