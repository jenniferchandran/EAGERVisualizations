If everything goes well, I will attempt to finish the AT this year. I will start later this week. Hope to keep a record of this hike and also hope to see some old friends on my way north. Start date will be in the next 4 days.","

Fresh Ground,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/455462,I woke this morning and realized that I had put my thoughts and dream on trailjournals. Wow. I usually keep things to myself so I can remain flexible. This is great. Now I feel like the commitment has been passed on to others. All I need to do is focus on having fun. Will probably start hiking before Trail Days in Damascus. Just want to try and get my trail legs before everyone passes me. I am smiling right now!!!,"home

Rain is forecast for thursday, so friday will still be my start day. I am sure trail days in Damascus will be fun and I would see alot of people that I know, but hiking is what I need now.","home

Fresh Ground,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456609,"day 1; started from Elk Garden mile 490.6 and hiked to Old Orchard Shelter mile 505.9 day 2; made it to Trimpi Shelter mile 520.0 day 3; made it to Partnership Shelter mile 530.6 I have finished the Highlands and will take a break to rest my neck. This was the injury that took me off trail in 2012. There is a problem when I hike distance, so I will take a break and do some trail support. This is also the first time that I have hiked without my dog and best friend Dottie. After losing her at Fontana Dam earlier this year, it is hard to hike without her. The memories of our hikes together are fresh and painful now. I may postpone any further hiking until the loss of her isn't so strong in my mind.","

Fresh Ground,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537542,"Well the time to hike is a little over one month away. This will be my SoBo portion of a flip-flop. I hiked NoBo from Springer on Feb.18th. Made it to mile 707.7, which is the McAfee Knob parking lot. Been working the last two months and buying some lighter summer gear. I will start hiking south from Katahdin on July 15th. Will be nice to be back in the woods. Hope to see my NoBo buddies and hiker family as this Southern boy heads toward home.","home
