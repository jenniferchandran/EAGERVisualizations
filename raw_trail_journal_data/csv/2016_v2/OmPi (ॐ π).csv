OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460851,"Ten years ago shortly after college I began looking into hiking the Appalachian Trail. At a crossroads in life I desired to do something to help find myself and maybe figure out what I wanted from life. More so than anything I think I desired the trail because it was a time with nature, a prize to be had, a goal to be accomplished. As well, my A personality said, ""Now is the time, before you have any additional obligation, things to hold you back, or prevent you from doing so. Now is the right time if ever there is one."" My adventure never took off. My hiking partner decided not to join and I attempted a short weekend trip on the FL Trail only to discover less than a mile in that I was entirely uncomfortable with the silence I would be experiencing over 6 months and 2180 miles. Fast forward 10 years and life has become a much more complicated. I've crossed into my 30's, have a relationship of 5 years, 3 little ones (dogs), a job I love, and we have just bought a house. Nothing is wrong with my life, actually it is pretty amazing, even if it is somewhat mundane. The call of the trail has never left me over the last 10 years, but it has subsided slightly that is until last year when I had a brush with death and much of my life was called into question.I questioned my friendships, my job, and my direction in life. I was broken down and in my weakness I found strength to begin to change the things that I found less than desirable. In the year to come I eliminated most of my toxic friendship, discovered how much I love my job, and began to change directions in my life. Here I am in the present still not entirely satisfied with life but in a better place than I was one year ago. My health and strength has returned, new friendships have started to be form, and a new path is beginning to be blazed ahead of me. Things are looking up but the soft quite call of the Trail is growing louder and louder and it is not going to be bypassed again. During the end of May 2014 I was walking some small simple trails in the NC mountains with my partner and best friend. I expressed a thought of hiking the AT which was met with interest from my friend and discouragement from my partner. I can't say that I blame him with all that we have built together over the last 5 years, the obligations that we currently have, the time away and many other things I can understand where this would seem like the most inopportune time to hike the AT. This is the warning that my A Personality told me 10 years ago that I should do the AT then before obligations piled up. But alas life takes its own path and lessons must be learned in the process. So I began researching, reading and dusting off my old information from years ago and found my inspiration stronger than ever. Progress a few weeks later and the AT has created some serious problems in my relationship, but my resolve has not faded. We will work through our problems and I know that my partner will come around. I have set a 2016 hiking plan to ensure that over the next 2 years I have plenty of time to satisfy my obligations and make arrangements for this journey, not to mention I have some conditioning to do if I intend on being successful. So with this post I breath life into this journey much like the divine I manifest the first vibration of this adventure which burst forth from within. All posts until my last will be about the my perseverance and preservation of this adventure until I complete it and experience the transformation that it will no doubt have on me and the world around me.",,"Om, The Beginning","Jun 11, Wed",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460854,"Part of deciding on a 2016 hike is to ensure that I have plenty of time to accomplish my necessary to do's before hiking.

For those on the trail what are some things you may have left undone that are on your mind that you wish you had done. For those planning your hike, what does your To Do list look like?

OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/460885,"The more I read of people's journals and accounts on the trail I realize that everyone has their Why or is at least seeking a Why for their hike. As AWOL mentioned in the first pages of his book it is rare for someone to have a definitive concisely articulate why. So it goes with me. My why is one that I cannot explain. As I have mentioned in other parts of this journal, my life is not in a bad place, actually quite the opposite is true. Unlike many I am not at a crossroads in my life having graduated from college, laid off a job, getting out of the military, recently separated or anything else. My why is not entirely answered but here are a few things that I do know about my why.

 I recently had a brush with death and that challenged me to live more in the present and live more free. 
 The adventure and accomplishment of hiking the Trail has been in my mind for over 10 years.
 Looking at today's world of perpetual connectivity with electronics and others, I crave to disconnect and commune with nature, myself and the divine. 
 I'm a bit of a starter and often not a finisher and I would like to prove to myself that I can and will finish this great task
 If not NOW, then WHEN?
 Nature often feels more at home, though not always as comfortable, to me.
 The Trail is calling out to me, in my thoughts, my dreams, my goals and aspirations
 While I cannot put my finger on it, I believe there is something to be learned, something specific to my life, something that will change everything about me and help me have a greater Positive Impact on this world and my life that can only come from this venture.


I want to hear from you:
What is/was your why? Do/Did you have one? If on the trail or having completed the trail, how important is the why in sustaining? If planning, how much of a role does your why have on your preparations? If off the trail did you have a why? If so, what was it and how did you deal with your why when getting off the trail? Also got everyone, does your why still drive you to want to get back on the trail or complete other dreams/goals?",,"Why OmPi, Why?","Jun 11, Wed",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461187,"All that is within me desires to be prepared for this journey. Thankfully knowing that I have 2 years to prepare has been a certain consolation though I don't want to wait till the last minute to begin. I have been considering what preparations need to take a priority. Clearly the thought of physical training, which is majorly necessary has a pretty high ranking. The desire to anticipate excessive weight loss, as I do not gain weight and tend to lose it fairly easily, has been on my mind. The thoughts of water fills, pack weight, and best gear, along with logistics of resupplies, mail drops, and zero days, have all been rummaging through my head. But none of these do I think are the primary item for which I need to prepare.
In the last few days, as I read through various journals and finalize AWOL's book, the reality of needing to train for internal strength and fortitude has been made very real to me. The ability to prepare not so much physically but mentally and emotionally I have decided is the number one priority for me. Blisters are sure to come, rain is sure to fall, I can expect to be freezing cold as well as hot, sweaty and bug bitten. All of these are things I've experienced before and made it through, I have not however been faced with all of these things on a nearly 2200 mile hike where the comforts of life are not just around the bend.
My problems comes in that I don't really know how to train for internal strength. If anyone has any insight I would love to hear it. I have been working on some exercises to gain strength, lose my building belly and increase stamina but I haven't yet figured out how to train to face my inner-self desiring to quit. I have considered Yoga and more than anything have been working to ensure I complete all that I start. 
Let me reveal a little something about myself, this is a major flaw of mine. My self reflection has really opened my eyes that I have a tendency to begin something that I am excited about, only shortly there after to abandon it when my enthusiasm wears out. Surely I am not alone in this, surely others have gone before me on this grand adventure and completed it with a similar mentality, as well I am certain many who have gone before and left the trail also had the same mentality.
The more I reflect on this particular need of internal fortitude and preparation the more self doubt creeps in and challenges my journey. All of this being said my recognition of this internal flaw is very much becoming one of my ""WHY's"" that I desire to do such a journey. I need to correct this imperfection and go forward in my life with a more dedicated drive, one that doesn't just desire to do lofty things but actually accomplishes them.
As always I would love to hear from you:Those who have completed the trail - How much do you think this internal fortitude played a role in your ability to complete it, as well did you do any thing to help prepare yourself for this self battle? What do you suggest for those of us who desire to be one of the few that hold firm and manage to complete the Trail.Those on the trail - Did you prepare, if you could have done more to ready yourself would it be for this internal struggle or something external? Any suggestions for us who will go after you?Those who have left the trail - Did you train mentally for the challenges of the trail? What did you do? What did you wish you would have done? How much did the physical elements compared to the mental challenges cause you to end your trip early?Other who are preparing - If you are like me at all you are fascinated with the logistics, the gear, minimizing your pack, and maximizing your miles, but have you thought about the mental challenges? Do you think they will be a problem for you? What are you doing to prepare to be part of the 1/4 who completes the trail?",,Internal Fortitude & Preparation,"Jun 13, Fri",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461754,"Daily as my reading, research and investigations continue I am introduced to new ideas, lingo and various other trail concepts. Most recently I came across the acronym of HYOH or Hike Your Own Hike. As with every community there are various takes on what a particular saying means. One of my favorites however is from Scott Bryce's Pacific Crest Trail Hiker Glossary. He describes HYOH as ""An encouragement between hikers to hike according to your own dreams, goals, expectations, etc, and not have your hike determined by other hiker's expectations."" It is your hike, hike it your way.Reading through some others views provides a little more specific view's on the HYOH saying (e.g. Dave's Don't HYOH). Dave attributes a little more Libertarian or moralistic focus on the saying, and he tends to disagree with the HYOH philosophy. His views of HYOH can be seen in his captioning a quote of another hiker ""as long as your hike does not effect other people, it's all kosher."" He proceeds to express his distain for this view by saying, ""most of [HYOH concepts] center around a refusal to engage in a debate over the purpose and minutia of lightweight backpacking, and by proxy a refusal to acknowledge that the details of how one pursues lightweight backpacking matter."" It doesn't appear that Dave and Scott understand HYOH differently rather they are taking different sides on the philosophy. My Libertarian nature holds that everyone should hike however they want and when seeing one hike differently realize that they may be coming to the trail from a different scenario. That being said I don't believe this rules out the debate, or more so, discussion on how to hike better, lighter, more or less comfortable, or even why hike at all, it simply means your views and situations are not the same as everyone else on the trail. Further reflection on this idea and how it applies personally revealed something else interesting to me, about me. My last hike (10 years ago) was sidelined when my hiking partner decided not to join. I now realize that I was not hiking my own hike I was hiking someone else's. Many fears have begun to creep in that something similar would happen this time and as I continue to reflect on this mantra I have come to peace with the fact that my 2016 AT hike is my own. If others care to join me, great! If someone decides not to join, great! I am preparing to go on this journey not for anyone else and thus I do not need anyone to accompany me. I am going to Hike My Own Hike.On another level, reading through some other's journals (currently Flinch's Journal has my eye) and having finished AWOL's book and now into a book called the Ultimate Hang (about hammock camping) I have come to realize that the AT provides so many opportunities beyond the simple purist mentality to which my rigid nature desire to conform. I have started to open my mind to alternative options so as to not miss the trail by being blinded by it. Thank you to Webbear and NiqNaq for signing my guestbook as well as Trail Pilgrim for the great advice of starting a personal AT Guide built from my own notes on my musings of so many other's accounts.",,My HYOH (Hike Your Own Hike) Philosophy ,"Jun 16, Mon",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462327,"A few days ago I was browsing through the Appalachian Trail Conservancy website on their FAQ's page and found they will send you a list of former thru hikers who have completed the trail who are willing to talk with you and help you with your planning etc. I wasted no time and got 5 of their lists. After reading through some of the general information they have compiled on each category in the lists I was able to rule out a few options and a fire was stoked for other options. I reached out to 9 former thru hikers and wanted to give a special thank you post to those who responded and have already provided invaluable information for planning, preparing, training, logistics, gear selection, etc. 
Baltimore Jack - Provided a number of great resources, namely the ATC site above, Trail Journals which is where you are reading this, along with The Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association and encouraged me to get to one of ""The Gathering"" events they host yearly. I think I will certainly have to look into that either this year or next before my hike. Before getting my email from him I had downloaded his resupply book from back in 2007, there are certainly some changes but a great read nonetheless. Thank you Baltimore Jack!Dan aka Late for Dinner - Dan is an ultralightweight hiker and his information has been incredible! He took some time to cover tons of gear, mentality, multi-use items, tips and techniques to get the most from the trail. He is really an awesome advocate for the AT and I know he will be a key to making my hike a successful one.I have to follow up on ""Dan the Man"". This guy is incredible, his story is awesome, his motivations and introduction to the trail are really interesting. He suffered with Lyme Disease while on the trail and didn't let anything stop him. By all means Dan is going to be the guru that helps me make it to Katahdin. Dan, if you read this, time to write a book and help thousands of others trying to make their way on the AT! Clinton aka Vagus - Thanks for taking the time to reply, hopefully we can chat. Check out his pictures on his TJ tons of them! Looks like a lot of fun to hike with.Juliet aka Just Blue Skies - Dehydrated 90% of her food for her hike. She has offered tons of information on diet, nutrition, gear, as well as various other insights into the trail. Thank for taking the time to share your insights and cover so much with me, I really look forward to further discussions. Also congrats of your 50th Birthday this week!Next to ""Dan the Man,"" Juliet has been the most helpful in preparing me for the venture ahead. I will be forever indebted to your wisdom that you have so graciously shared with me. She is clearly a major advocate for the AT as well.
Samwise - Great website about hiking and backpacking on the Appalachian Trail as a VEGAN. I appreciate your insight and help.
Sprout - Thanks for writing back even in the middle of your hike. I wish you luck in your current adventure and look forward to hearing from you soon.
Neal aka Old Gear - I am continually impressed with the amount of help and support I have received from people I don't even know. Neal is a perfect example, taking time out of his PCT hike to send a few emails and have a phone conversation with me about my AT planning. His initial advice was to be sure to start strength training my knees, ankles and working on increasing balance. This guy is great, a wealth of information, and has offered to help coach me in my preparations. 
I also feel I should mention:AWOL - For his  inspirational book giving his account of his time on the AT as well as taking the A.T. Guide Book to a whole new level.Good Badger - For his  book on mentally preparing for the Appalachian Trail as well as a number of other random blog posts, updates etc that I read of his. This guy will crack you up! Google him The Good Badger or Zach Davis and visit his website at http://zrdavis.com/I will update this particular post often as more respond and the Trail Advocates above offer greater insight.

OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/465122,"Well I have continued to absorb info over the holiday weekend while spending time with my family. The Good Badger's book (Appalachian Trials) can now be crossed off my list, though I'm sure I will reread it at least a few more times before starting my adventure. If you are unfamiliar with Good Badger or his book, I strongly recommend it and for those who are serious about ensuring you complete the trail, it is the only book I have found that focuses on the mental and psychological preparation for the AT. One of the suggestions of Badger to mentally prepare is to complete an exercise which requires you to ponder, meditate, reflect on, and complete 3 simple statements regarding your goal of a Thru-Hike. He suggests taking at least 10-15 minutes on each statement and then actually write your reflections down, make a list, and bring it with you on the trail. He recommends reviewing it regularly especially while you are on the trail and more importantly when you are facing challenges and your own Appalachian Trials. I am Thru-Hiking the Appalachian Trail because... (This should focus on reasons for hiking the trail. I considered the question why do the trail now?)Life is short and later may never come!I need a break from excess connectivity and reevaluate what really matters.In spite of all the good in my life something is missing.I desire different experiences, people and challenges in my life.My life often feels boring and I desire an AWESOME adventure and more thrills.I want to Pursue the Unknown.The trap of Consumerism is building within me and I want to live ""Less is More"".I feel at home and ""connected"" when in nature.When I successfully Thru-Hike the Appalachian Trail, I will... (This should focus on personal benefits I will experience/acquire once completing the trail.)Have new friends with whom to share life's passions, joys and sorrows.Obtain new skills that will make me more successful in life.Better understand myself, nature, and the Divine.Have Life Long Memories that the effects of Dementia will never be able to erase.Be a More Positive Impact in the World.Know that I can do anything, even if it is unknown or difficultHave disciplined my body and mind which will help me be more successful in other areas of my life.Create new opportunities in my own life.Be a part of an Elite Community of men and women.If I give up on the Appalachian Trail, I will...(These are the negative emotions and perceptions you will have of yourself if you quit. For this I question how will I feel about myself if I give up?)Feel Defeated and Weak.Lose confidence in myself and my abilities to accomplish future goals.Have proven those who doubted me right.Let down those who believed in me or lived vicariously through me.Be stuck in a cycle of meaningless nonsense.This powerful exercise is sure to be effective not only for accomplishing your goal of completing the AT but can also be applied to any of your other life goals.",,Mental Prep work for ,"Jul 08, Tue",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/465714,"I have been researching and learning more and more about the Ultralight Movement. Based on the recommendations of Dan ""Late 4 Dinner"" I picked up and read through Ultralight Backpackin' Tips by Mike Clelland. Great book and great insight. The burden of excess weight while hiking is a known physical and often mental/emotional challenge, though the trade off of having additional comforts can make cutting pounds, ounces, and grams from your pack a burden. When I first started hiking as a kid, I didn't give any thought to weight, now that I am preparing for a long distance adventure on the AT my initial thought was to fall into the low end of the lightweight category. Then after some consideration I like the challenge of trying to fall into the UL category. I'm still not certain that I will be at an UL weight by the time I hike but the goal has been an exciting adventure in my planning over the last few weeks. For a quick look at what some of these definitions mean I suggest a perusing of wikipedia's small Ultralight Backpacking Page. In general the goal of the Ultralighter is to get their base pack weight to under 10 lbs by eliminating redundancy, using better materials, and willfully minimizing what one needs in the great outdoors. This does not mean being stupid, unsafe or ill-prepared. I have just broken the sub 10 lb base pack weight in my planning. There is no guarantee that this will be my final gear list but I was proud to have negotiated with myself to reduce, find the best, lightest weight gear for my needs. I have a feeling I'll be pretty sporty with my gear as well. Time to keep my eyes pealed for sales and discounts as well. Between now and October I want buy a Pack, my Cooking Gear, and some kind of trail runner. I already have a hammock and other sleep gear but they will need to be upgraded (reduced in weight) before my big trip. Once gear begins to arrive I would like to start section hiking the Florida Trail on some weekends and breaks over the next 20+ months. Ideally before I depart on the AT I would have hiked the entire length of the Florida Trail.",,"To Go Ultralight or Not, that is the question...","Jul 12, Sat",0

OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/472164,"While it is not quite hiking season here in FL yet I have over the last month begun some preparations for the big 2016 AT Hike! In my second entry ""Pre Hike 2"", I had outlined a few to do's before the hike and every day that list seems to get longer not shorter. The other day however my Partner and I had a discussion on the AT venture and it went really well, so well that his position has become one of support rather than discouragement towards this big venture. This is a huge item to have checked off my list!
One month ago to the day I also started some basic simple physical & mental training for the hike. This has taken the form of Yoga and personal meditation. One month ago I was a disaster with balance, posture, strength and form; today I am a little better off and discovered through this training that I really enjoy the yoga practice. To ensure I remain committed to training and moving forward on this journey I have signed up for a 30-day Yoga Challenge. The Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual benefits from Yoga are sure to help me all the more in preparing for this amazing adventure.
Finally I also managed to dust off some of my old gear and gather a few items that have collected around the house over the years to put together the beginnings of a test pack to run on the FL Trail with this hiking season. Lots still to do with gear but it was great to go through what I had and see the changes in the hiking gear world over the last 10 years.

OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/473146,"So I have to tell you my greatest fear other than not completing the trail is that of bugs on the trail. No not an irrational fear like entomophobia but a fear of being bitten, eaten and worse infected especially with diseases that can cause severe illness like Lyme Disease. While I don't know that I've mentioned it or if it has come across in my past posts, I'm somewhat of a ""crunchy granola"" kinda guy and have a small case of chemophobia or at least I don't like using chemicals whenever possible. This fear as well I would not qualify as irrational as the toxic risk of excessive or regular chemical use has been demonstrated well enough for my belief. So when you combine these two things, a bit of a sticky situation can be the result, namely how am I going to address one without caving on the other. Outside of Food and Gear how to prevent bugs from biting and thus infecting me has been one of the top items I have been researching and I feel I have found some solutions.DEET - The chemical option! While the EPA continues to suggest that DEET does not present a health concern to the general public I know I don't like it, it makes me feel funny and knowing that the skin is highly absorbent the idea of lacing my body with it for months on end doesn't appeal to me. As well if you read through the EPA's ""Using DEET products safely"" you will see that on the AT it will be nearly impossible to use DEET safely according to their advice. This will be a last resort that I will pick up on the trail if all else fails me.Foods & Diet - Whether science or old wives tales some suggest certain foods and vitamins (i.e. onions, garlic, various herbs and spices, Apple Cider Vinegar, Marmite, B12, bananas, beans, and citrus especially grapefruit) will repel bitting insects. For me seeing as most of these items are common in my daily diet I'm hopeful that it will be helpful on the trail. Some of these items may help you on your inward journey as other hikers may also be repelled.Essential Oils - My secret weapon for the trail is a natural Essential Oil based bug repellant that is still being formulated and tested but I can and will share some of the possible essential oils going into the mix. Rose Geranium (This lady swears by it for her and her dogs in the fight against ticks. Dogs Naturally Magazine references it as well as an effective preventative.) Wellness Mama whom I love and adore has her own suggestions for a Homemade bug spray using Citronella, Clove, Lemongrass, Rosemary, Tea Tree, Cajeput, Eucalyptus, Cedar, Catnip, Lavender, and/or Mint Essential Oils. I figure I have a good few months in the FL Mosquito season to test my concoction before giving it a real go on the trail.Permethrin - Another Chemical Option! While I am hesitant still of using it regularly I think for the trail I will soak some of my gear in this as another preventative. The biggest reason I am compromising on this item is because it has been shown to be much more effective against ticks (LYME DISEASE INFECTING BASTARDS) than DEET with much less of the toxic side effects. Not to mention this is applied primarily to gear, clothes, etc through soaking then drying rather than directly onto my skin. I know I know if its on my clothes and my skin is touching my clothes it is bound to have some transference, but I am willing to accept the effects because the results appear to be top quality. I will probably leave the bottle in my bounce box and send it to myself along the way as applications usually last a few weeks it seems. Bug Gear - There seems to be lots of different bug gear out there which I'm sure will be helpful for mosquitos and black flies as apparently they get pretty bad on the AT in certain states. Anyway still trying to figure out if the excess weight will be worth having more than what I have in my arsenal already. If anyone has insight on this as well as suggestions I'd love to hear it. What about you all? What are your plans for dealing with bugs, chemicals or anything else along the trail. Share your insights on my guestbook or shoot me an email. Big shout out to ShutterBug thanks for the Guestbook Entry! Looking forward to crossing paths on the Trail.",,Phobias,"Sep 05, Fri",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/473478,"While other preparations are probably more practical, I think every AT Hiker loves talking gear more than most anything else. Gear doesn't really do it for me, while I think it is great, truth be told it's just stuff, necessary stuff to get me from point A in GA to B in ME. Maybe it is the Franciscan in me that disregards stuff but it is also that same nature that leads me to the Ultralight or at least Lightweight mentality and the desire to function in the less is more mindset.

OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/475502,"I've heard many things about this trip, mostly positive and affirming but some negative. In the time leading up to a long distance thru-hike, especially if you are sharing about your upcoming journey, someone you come across is bound to give negative feedback at some point.""That's out of the ordinary"" is one of many that I have heard and it was meant in both a positive and negative fashion. Others have reminded me in various ways of my joy in starting and yet not always finishing something. Some have asked ""Are you still doing the Appalachian Trail thing?"" and many people are curious with all the other commitments in life how I am going to be able to take 6 months away.Today when I read this quote it spoke to my inner being, it reflected my desires back at me, and it encouraged me in this journey. I want to take a moment and share it with all of you and encourage each of you who are following this journey of mine to take a moment and reflect on this reality.Our existence is not even a blip on the spectrum of time. If we continually focus on doing what others desire of us, what society tells us is necessary, and what we have grown up being programed to believe, we will have wasted what little time we have. I encourage you to reflect on this and don't focus on the past but what you can do NOW and in the FUTURE!",,Its Just Not Normal!,"Oct 01, Wed",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476180,"The all powerful ""they"" say when you dream in a different language is when you know that you have a working use of that language. I wonder if the same applies to the Appalachian Trail? This morning I woke up from a dream about starting the AT and while it didn't make a lot of sense (do dreams ever?), it got me to thinking that this trip is very real for me, so real I'm actually dreaming about being on the Trail, meeting the people, and having experiences and on an adventure of a lifetime. This morning I am up early watching the second blood moon of this tetrarch. Apparently the 21st century will have something insane like 8 of these sets of 4 total lunar eclipse which in some ways makes it a pretty incredible time to be alive. Sitting here in my light polluted sky has me yearning for some true wilderness where this very unique cosmic experience could be experienced in its fullness and not just over the roof and between the lights of Whole Foods where employees are walking in staring at their phones missing the beautiful and magical experience that is happening. In spite of my present situation I am feeling connected to Nature, to the Divine, and to everything and one around me; and clearly my spirit is looking forward to the adventure that is still over a year away. I really am looking forward to meeting people who are willing to disconnect and take a moment to open their eyes, minds and hearts while choosing to connect to something greater than themselves.Namaste!""All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.""- T.

OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476761,"Preparations continue for the AT. I continue to read, research, talk to past hikers, train mentally and physically. As I have mentioned in past posts Yoga has become a major source of training as I know it will help me mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually on this amazing journey. Last month I completed a 30-day yoga challenge and decided based on my schedule that I would continue with a 60-day yoga challenge. This has been a huge step in the right direction for me and my habit of starting and losing interest. Speaking of habits, one of the reasons people recommend 30-day challenges and one of the reasons I chose to commit to a 30-day challenge was to ""form a new habit"" which some say it takes 21-days to create. Forbes.com has a great article about creating habits and addresses the myth of the 21-day habit formation. In this article the author discusses how simply doing something for 21-days does not necessarily make it a habit and from where this idea came. He continues by offering 3 stages of habit formation and I found them really useful for the Appalachian Trail. The first stage of habit formation is the ""Honeymoon Period"" where things seem perfect and nothing can go wrong. This is the period of joy, where you are riding high and overlooking all the problems because something is new, fresh and exciting. The truth is however no matter how great the honeymoon is that it will have to come to an end.Stage 2 is the ""Fight Thru"" and this is the point that really struck me. A lot of the suggestions the author makes to create a successful habit (ie finishing the AT), happen here in this stage. What is interesting is that many of the preparations Zach Davis suggests in Appalachian Trials, are the same as those offered in this step. The fight thru is exactly what it sounds, when the honeymoon wears off and old habits are ready to take back over (ie you are ready to get off the trail), you must fight thru 2-3 times to overcome and solidify your commitment to this new habit. You successfully complete a fight thru by recognizing you are entering into a battle period, next do it in spite of your urge to go back, and finally keep a humility about yourself. Unfortunately there is no easy way around the fight thru but there are some tools to help in your battle. The biggest tools are found in knowing your why's and answering the questions the author recommends and Zach Davis recommends in Appalachian Trials (my answers). Also reflect on them regularly and revisit them when you have the feeling of letting the old habits take hold, in our case when you are ready to give up on the AT.Finally you will have a new habit, once you have 2-3 Fight Thru's under your belt. That being said it doesn't mean you are immune from backsliding or falling into old habits again but the process of staying committed will become much easier. When in this stage beware of discouragement (days of rain), disruptions (illness), and bigheadedness (I'm too good for anything to stop me). If you run into any of these, know that you are probably going to need another 2-3 Fight Thru's to get back to a successful habit.More than anything else we must remember this process is not going to be easy and success through great habits take daily work, they are never permanent and require constant commitment. As I continue in my preparations and the formations of new habits to help me be successful on the AT I commit to often reflecting on these points as well as revisiting and updating my own answers to the Appalachian Trial suggested questions.",,The Fight Thru,"Oct 19, Sun",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477376,"One of the questions I most often receive when mentioning my upcoming AT Thru-Hike is ""Are you hiking alone or with others?"" and my answer is a confounding, ""Yes!"" I then share with them that I will be setting out alone but quickly follow up by sharing that the AT is a very active and social trail, with thousands of hikers on it, this in spite of the reality that very few complete their Thru-Hike. So yes I will be hiking alone and yes I will be hiking with others. Even if I were to find a specific hiking partner (which I really do not desire, for reasons past mentioned in my original post and my HYOY post), I would still not hike every step of the trail with this person by my side or even within ear shot. Hiking pace and style, nature's calling, minor injuries and setbacks would all create space. This seems to be common place for friends and strangers who become friends on the trail, you fall into a Hiking Bubble. I've been reading and this topic of hiking bubbles and groups that form on the trail have been prominent lately and a theme seemed to require some reflection. I can hear my mother saying it now ""You need to be careful who you surround yourself with."" As a kid you looked at her and said ""Ok, Mom whatever,"" but now as an adult this has really struck home. A man by the name of Jim Rohn has a similar saying, ""You are the Average of the 5 people you spend the most time with."" Take a moment and read that again and think about it. Think about the 5 people you keep closest and see if it speaks truth to you?A little over a year ago when I was struggling with my health and my world was turned upside down I was confronted with this statement and it is one of the mantras that I continue repeating to myself as I decide on what and with whom to spend my time. It is something that I know will influence my hiking bubble/group. AWOL, The Good Badger, and various others in their hiking journals mention or have demonstrated that they were pulled up or down by their hiking bubble. 
The Badger offers A word of Caution to Aspiring Hikers and speaks to this point directly suggesting you surround yourself with people who are ""intoxicated on serotonin throughout their hike, regardless of the obstacles thrown their way... their energy is infectious."" He also discusses ""those who struggle from day one and continue to do so until the day they quit."" The rest of us are the average of these people who will have good days and bad days, who will want to quite at times and other times be in sheer awe of the glories of trail life. As for me and my hike, I will surround myself with as many positive people who are thrilled to have the experiences they are having and can see the silver lining behind every rain cloud.",,Are you Hiking Alone?,"Oct 27, Mon",0
OmPi (ॐ π),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478112,"A dear friend, mentor and a person I consider teacher read the following excerpt the other day from David Whyte. ""BEGINNING well or beginning poorly, what is important is simply to begin, but the ability to make a good beginning is also an art form, beginning well involves a clearing away of the crass, the irrelevant and the complicated to find the beautiful, often hidden lineaments of the essential and the necessary. Beginning is difficult, and our procrastination is a fine, ever-present measure of our reluctance to take that first close-in, courageous step in reclaiming our happiness. Perhaps, because taking a new step always leads to a kind of radical internal simplification, where, suddenly, very large parts of us, parts of us we have kept gainfully employed for years, parts of us still rehearsing the old complicated story, are suddenly out of a job. There occurs in effect, a form of internal corporate downsizing, where the parts of us too afraid to participate or having nothing now to offer, are let go, with all of the accompanying death-like trauma, and where the very last fight occurs, a rear guard disbelief that this new, less complicated self, and this very simple step, is all that is needed for the new possibilities ahead. It is always hard to believe that the courageous step is so close to us, that it is closer than we ever could imagine, that in fact, we already know what it is, and that the step is simpler, more radical than we had thought: which is why we so often prefer the story to be more elaborate, our identities clouded by fear, the horizon safely in the distance, the essay longer than it needs to be and the answer safely in the realm of impossibility...""In hearing this I could not help but reflect on the great adventure that is ahead in the Appalachian Trail and recognizing how true and pointed these words are for those of us preparing to begin on this new journey. I am now, even with so many connections severed, still tied to this world so strongly, in a complex web of irrelevant connectedness. To begin this journey well, I have come to accept, is entirely an art and not a science. Daily working to willfully release all that is not simple and essential will only help my resolve to reach Katahdin. My happiness is so often prevented by my reluctance and fear of embracing the simple, or more pointedly simply embracing that which is. When I embrace the reality that my 5,000,000th step is far less radical than the first step from Springer Mountain is when I know that I will have taken up my rank as a humbled student of the trail.",,Difficulty of Beginning,"Nov 11, Tue",0
