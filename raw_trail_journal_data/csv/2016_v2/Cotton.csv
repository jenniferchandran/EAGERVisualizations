Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516091,"Here's a list of some of the books I've read in preparation of my thru-hike. These are the ones I thought were helpful. The really bad ones are left off. I'll add more as come across them. Apologies for some of the limited reviews as it's been a few years since I read them, so my memory is faint, but I added them because they left a good impression way back when. They're in no particular order.Miller, David - AWOL on the Appalachian Trail – It’s a good read and gives a nice presentation of a thru-hike. The first person present narrative gets tedious. AWOL has the go-to AT trail guide.Davis, Zack – Appalachian Trials: A Psychological and Emotional Guide to Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail – I was skeptical of this book, but picked it up after numerous positive comments. It’s worthwhile and provides good advice for overcoming the mental aspect of a thru-hike.Blanchard, Dennis – Three Hundred Zeroes – Three Hundred Zeroes comes from taking 300 days off in order to have open heart surgery to repair a genetic heart defect. Stolz, Digger A. – Stumbling Thru: Hike Your Own Hike – Part one. Good readStolz, Digger A. – Stumbling Thru: Keepin’ On Keepin’ On – Part two. Good readBryson, Bill - A Walk In the Woods – The first AT book I read. I’ve read several times, now, and it’s still entertaining. But, don’t count on it for a very thorough feel for a thru-hike.Johansson, Jorge – Smarter Backpacking After 50 – For us mid-life folks (or beyond), the probability of successfully completing a thru-hike is inversely proportional to pack weight. Jorge provides a good primer on that end.Grinter, Lawton – I Hike – Lawton is a member of the Triple Crown club having thru-hiked the Appalachian, Pacific Crest and Continental Divide Trails. This book is a collection of his poignant experiences and worth the read.Montgomery, Ben – Grandma Gatewood’s Walk: The Inspiring Story of the Woman who Saved the Appalachian Trail – this is an inspiring story of one of the early thru-hikers.Walker, Bill – Skywalker – Close Encounters on the Appalachian Trail – This is a guy you wouldn’t expect to have finished his thru-hike due to inexperience and issues with hypothermia and many cautioned him against the attempt. But, he did it. Good read.Fletcher, Colin & Chip Rawlins – The Complete Walker IV – My first book on preparing to backpack. Although backpacking technology advances every year, this is still a good starting point and the go-to reference.Curran, Jan D. – The Appalachian Trail: How to Prepare for and Hike It – Good basic information for a start.Emblidge, David, Ed. – The Appalachian Trail Reader – This book provides excellent background on the history of the Trail’s origins and the Appalachians in general. It’s a must read for any hiker, thru-hikers and section hikers alike.Shaffer, Earl V. – Walking With Spring – Earl Shaffer was the first person to thru-hike the Trail in one season. Until then, it was considered an impossible feat. The trail Earl hiked is entirely a different trail than the one hiked today. It’s longer and in some ways more difficult today. It’s a good read if only to see the advances in hiking equipment.Rubin, Robert Alden – On the Beaten Path: An Appalachian Trail Pilgrimage – This well written book provides good insight on a thru-hike. With many of the AT books, it’s hard to keep track of progress in terms of mileage/days progress. This one does a good job in that regard.",,Reading List,"Oct 21, Wed",0

I had a great Christmas, though. My wife and I spent some quality time with my wife's mother and sister in Nebraska and then drove to Michigan for my son's wedding (at which I officiated - quite an honor). My three year old granddaughter made a beautiful flower girl.
Now's the time to buy that last bit of gear. I still need to get a sleeping bag (Big Agnes Zirkel UL20) and a backpack (Osprey Aether 70).

I'm reading the Journals of the early birds and looking forward to reading how things are going for them.I'm getting a little nervous about hiking in the Bubble, but there's nothing I can do about it. I chose my start date because I want to start soon enough to ensure getting to Katahdin before it closes + wiggle room, but not so soon as to be strapped with a lot of snow.

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524225,"Last night it got down to about 38F with a 10-15 mph breeze. That was pretty chilly as a broke down camp at 6AM, trying to get a head start to Blue Mountain shelter and a chance at one of the 7 shelter spots. Closing camp and hiking with the headlamp was a new one, but it went pretty well. There was water a shirt way down the trail, so I didn't get water at the shelter before I left. I took my gloves off to get water and, somehow, lost my left glove. I wasn't sure where I'd left it because I had been putting them on and taking them off as I moved from the cooler/windier hill tops to the warmer/stiller valleys. Without that left glove, my hands were getting very cold and I started to make plans on where I might replace them in Hiawassee and there was no way I would backtrack who knows how far to find it.As I walked along in the early light I saw a black thing on the trail. A glove and a left one, at that. I knew it could only belong to one of two guys who had passed me, both of whom I'd been hiking with - I use this term loosely. We start and end at the same shelters. Since people were making their Hiawassee plans, I wasn't sure I would meet up with them. Finally, when I got to Unicoi Gap, all of these young hikers are gathered around a Trail Angel tent waiting for their shuttle to a hostel. I walk up, drop my pack, and ask, ""Did anyone lose a left glove?"" All the other guys laugh and point to this guy I figured was the one. Then, he asks, ""Dud you lose a glove?"" He found my glove. So we exchanged gloves much to the amusement of everyone and I lifted my arms and said, ""Thank you, Jesus!""Today had several firsts:1) I hiked in clouds2) I hiked in sleet 3) I hiked in rain4) hiked with my headlamp 5) I fell Regarding #5:The section between Low Gap Shelter and Chattahoochee Gap is pretty tame. After Chattahoochee Gap, it gets pretty tricky and continues to be tough until Unicoi Gap with a few reprieves. In one of these tough areas I was day dreaming and miss-stepped. Center of Gravity (CG) is important in aviation and, evidently, backpacking. Anyway, I stumbled and put my trekking pole down to catch me, like I've done a hundred times before. Only this time the pole found only air. I tried to catch myself with pure physical strength - not gonna happen. The next think I knew, I was in a slow downward spiral toward a 100' drop. Earlier in the day, Umgawa mentioned the nice thing about the AT is that if you roll off the Trail, you won't roll far because a tree will stop you. I knew there was no saving this, so I went defense. As I fell, I tucked my trekking poles straight and underneath me, crossed my arms across my chest and enjoy the ride. I ended up facing the way I came and pinned between a tree and my backpack (which was lodged against the rock I just fell off of). I tried to get up, but I was the proverbial turtle on his back. I tried to get my pack off, but I was wedged in so tight, I couldn't reach my straps. I finally get the straps unbuckled through a great deal of grunting, some of which was necessary. As I'm getting out of the straps, along comes a young lady on a mission for a shelter spot and doesn't even ask why I live this spot so dearly that I would be groveling in it. She stepped over my sprawled kegs and is on her way. This scene is repeated by two more hikers in quick succession for a grand total of three hikers whizzing by without a word (in all honesty, one of them might have looked down and said hi. On the third pass, I was tempted to ask, ""Pardon me, but have you seen a Samaritan in these parts, by chance?""The good news is, no harm done.I'm now at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee. A darn good $50 room which I would highly recommend. I'm not sure if I will take a zero here tomorrow or not (a zero day is a day with zero miles hiked). The weather forecast is black ice in the morning with 1-2"" of snow. After yesterday's 9.7 miles and my tired legs, that's not a good combination with ice and snow (not to mention 2 1,00' climbs/descents right out of the box). I also need to find a spare cell phone battery. I sent the big clunker home and the cold killed my phone. I'll post either way, but probably zeroing.No phone is why there are no pictures. But, if you haven't already, check out my photo journal. I have more pictures there.Thanks for the encouragement through my guestbook and through Carolyn.","Low Gap Shelter

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524348,"My zero day in Hiawassee gives me a chance to reflect. Today is my father's birthday. He would have been 92. Happy birthday, dad, I still miss you. In the beginning of the movie A Walk In the Woods, Bryson is standing in a funeral visitation reception line to give his respects to the widow. A man behind Bryson leans in and says, ""It kind of makes you want to slow down."" I always think to myself, ""It kind of makes me want to speed up!"" My father passed away in 1982, just before his 58th birthday. That's too young. Ever since then, I've been keenly aware that time is nigh. Maybe that's part of why I'm on the AT. Go for it. Why wait? Why not? As I approach 60, I realize that feeling will never end. Moving down the Trail, I'm already planning my next adventure. When I spoke to Carolyn last night, she told me Moses was feeling down with me not there. A week ago, she and I left and only she returned. He looked for me, but I wasn't there. He and I are together almost all the time. So, what does this have to do with my AT hike or my father? I learned a lot about parenting from Moses. I learned that being a good father is 85% praise, 13% correction, and 2% rebuke (or, as Yogi Berra might say, 80% praise and 50% correction). In raising my kids, and the same as my father raised me, I felt the number one job of a father was correction and rebuke. Why praise someone for doing what they should be doing all along? Right? With Moses, I learned that the more I praised him for the little things, the better he understood doing right over doing wrong. At the beach, ""Good boy, Moses, you didn't chase after that other dog!"" It's the same for kids. At the end of the day, ""Good job, junior, you didn't set your brother on fire, today!""The Bible teaches that we should be mindful of scripture at all times and in everything we do (Deuteronomy 6:6-9). In the middle of that passage, it tells us to also teach it to our children. There are worse ways to raise a child, IMHO.My father served in the Army Air Force during WWII, was shot down once and had many close calls due to what he referred to as a ""Crazy pilot."" Now, we know about PTSD. Back then, they suffered through it. I think my father had his share of suffering, but he did it on his own - I think my backside suffered a little, too.Happy birthday, dad, you would be proud of your grandchildren and their spouses and they would have been blessed to have known you.

On the flat sections, I had to slow down because i could feel hot spots on my feet. I don't want sparks coming off my shoes and starting a fire, hahaha!The Trail was smooth for the most part and pretty easy to navigate. As I neared the top of Tray Mountain it became very similar to the top of Blood Mountain (check pictures in May, 2015 for Blood Mtn). I came across some Trail Magic at Tray Gap. Some local retirees were using Trail Magic as an excuse to go sit in the woods. Whatever the reason, it was greatly appreciated coming just when/where I was going to have some lunch before the final push up Tray Mountain. I was in my happy place hiking today, tooling along, listening to my hiking playlist and playing lyric theology.Lyric theology is where I listen to the lyrics in secular songs, place them into a systematic theology category and then give myself a sermonette on the lyrics in terms of the theology it represents. When you listen to James Brown, The Commodores, The Crusaders, ZZ Top, The Grateful Dead, Melanie, Van Morrison, Billy Joel, Judy Collins, Queen... it can be quite interesting and upliftingI have a nice campsite near Tray Mountain Shelter overlooking some mountains and a valley. It's clear and cool, now, so I expect to see many stars tonight. It's breezy, so I set the narrow part of the tent into the wind. We had a hard freeze last night and I expect one tonight as well. I think I'll see a splendid sunrise from this spot tomorrow. I hope I can capture it.I was talking to another hiker at Tray Gap and we both noticed the hikers are thinning out. I haven't seen Texas since Low Gap. This guy mention that 25% drop out at Neel Gap and about half of those that started at Springer will be gone by the Smokeys. When I get to Franklin in 5-6 days, I'm going to get a compression thingy for my left knee while hiking and support socks for my feet when I sleep (I've heard they really help).

It was pretty breezy when I got to camp, but gave me a chance to set up my clothes line and dry off my tent footprint. Then, the sun went down and the wind came up. I'm positive the wind got up to 50mph and I laid in my sleeping bag thankful I pushed the stakes in just a little more before I turned in.
The crazy thing about this wind was it would howl and then die down to nothing - dead calm. Then, in no time, I'd hear the wind in the valley rushing up the hill for another assault. This went on all night. I came to the conclusion that God must have sleep apnea. What a racket!
The hike from Tray Mountain to Deep Gap was very smooth. Sassafras Mountain was the tough climb, but only 800 feet in a mile.

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524710,"I didn't have internet yesterday, so I'm posting the 3/23 & 3/24 journals today. I was the first to arrive at Deep Gap shelter, which is an all-time first for me. A fire was still smoldering in the fire pit from the previous night's hikers. Since I had a raging headache, I snagged a spot in the shelter and took a nap. An hour later, I heard the noise of other arrivals and crawled out of my bag to check it out. One person was going through his pack, but another was showering the area for firewood. Something caught my eye with this fellow and as I focused in I saw that, first of all, he was walking through the brush in his bare feet. Second was his clothes. He was wearing blue jeans and a cotton t-shirt. Although this was fair game twenty or even ten years ago, cotton is a big no-no for thruhiking. It's heavy and when wet offers zero insulation. The first thing that came to mind when I saw him was Horace Kephart's stories of the 'mountain folk' in his book Our Southern Highlanders. These people preferred bare feet even during the winter and preferred sleeping on the bare ground during heavy frost. Mountain Shadow (Chuck's trail name) is sleeping in a hammock without a rain fly or sleeping bag. He showed me holes in his coveralls, which he sleeps in, where he got too close to the fire sleeping one night when it got down to 18F and snowed. I left Deep Creek this morning before Mountain Shadow was up, but bumped into him, again, this afternoon at the Hiawassee grocery store. There was no vacancies left at the hostel when he arrived, so he's back on the Trail. I hope I see him, again.There's a threat of thunderstorms this afternoon so I hiked the short distance to Dick's Creek and then down the hill to the Top of Georgia hostel. I'm glad I did. This mountain home transformed into a hostel is very nice and the staff is friendly, hospitable, and efficient. I'm glad I stayed here. Only 8.9 miles until the North Carolina State line. I was reunited with two trail buddies here at the hostel. Jingles with her Boxer, Ziva (Hebrew for radiant - Jingles isn't Jewish) and Texas.

After 3 zeros at the Top of Georgia Hostel, his right foot is still swollen (possible stress fracture) and after 3 miles on the Trail today the T-Band on his left hip brought him down to a crawl. At the 5.3 mile mark, we discussed whether he should continue ten more miles to a possible pick up location, or walk the 5.3 miles back to Dick's Creek Gap. He wisely chose the latter. I'll miss you, Texas, the hike wont be the same without you.Big milestone day, today, I crossed into North Carolina. Woo-Hoo!!! I also met a new dog family; Blue and his wife Chili and her dog, Brody (sp? He's named after that famous Olympic downhill skier). We hiked leap frogging all day and Brody and I became good friends.The hike was fun, today, with no major issues. I'm always stronger after time in town. Interestingly, the trail seemed to change when we got about 2 miles from the state line. The footing was less Liam and more gravely and I walked through a beautiful Rhododendron forest. Before that was a standing pine forest with a great pine smell. The campground here at Bly Gap, a tenth of a mile into NC, is on a slope, so I'll be swimming upstream, tonight. There are about a dozen people here including Mountain Shadow. I met Westy and Golden Eagle on the Trail, both of which have Trail Journals.

Mountain Shadow, a true Georgia mountain man, said these were called sitting trees. The Indians and mountain folks once used these kinds of trees to store supply caches and also to sit on while hunting to wait for game to come by. This sitting tree is the traditional GA/NC border and the most photographed tree on the Trail. It seemed as though stepping across the North Carolina border, we stepped into a completely new ecosystem. The rocky climbs of Georgia have given way to a misty Rhododendron forests and cascading streams. The Smokeys are a natural rain forest and I seem to be getting somewhat of a foretaste of the Smokeys. Even the rocky sections are moss-covered enchantment. Needless to say, all hikers agree it's truly a wonderland.It seems, also, the peaks are more stretched out and gradual. Certainly not the chest-clutchers I experienced in Georgia, or possibly I'm starting to get my trail legs. A little bit of both, maybe. The weather has certainly cooperated. It's been mostly cloudy today, which has kept the temps down, which is greatly appreciated.As I came down to Deep Gap, 0.9 miles from Standing Indian shelter, there was a family laughing and talking on the slopes along the Trail. An elderly woman was next to the Trail with a cloth sack digging in the dark loam soil among the dead leaves. I asked her what she was picking and she said Ramps. I recall in my readings that Ramps are a very popular in the spring time and are a traditional part of Easter meals in these parts. Ramps are like scallion with a broad leaf. What they taste like, I haven't a clue.As I bottomed out at Deep Gap, I saw a banner that said, 25th Annual East (something or other)"". There were several cars parked in the Gap and I could see more vehicles and tents about a hundred yards down a side road. Since I didn't see anything on the banner that suggested Trail Magic or even hiker, I assumed it was a church function, so I continued my trudge up to the shelter. About half way up, I met two ladies on their way down. They told me about the hiker feed at the tents. At the end of the day, I am in no mood to retrace even a half mile and I didn't have much of an appetite at that time, anyway.When I got to the shelter, I was greeted by Kevin (now, Lt. Dan) and the father of the two teenage boys who had passed me at a run in their way to the food. Lt. Dan and I agreed we were not going to walk nine tenths of a mile down a mountain and the back up for anything.I was pretty surprised and pleased there was room in the shelter, particularly considering the forecast for rain. Evidently, the hiker bash had all of the fast hikers pinned down with a BBQ. Well played, hiker bash people. I saw three backpacks in the shelter, so I asked, ""So, I guess there's room for me in the shelter."" The dad asked, ""Where, here?"" ""Uhm, yea.""""Oh, I don't think there's room for any more. My boys and I are sleeping in here."" I showed the nervous dad that the AT Guide shows the shelter is supposed to hold 8. ""Oh,"" said the dad. I think if you don't want your sons to sleep with strangers in an AT shelter, don't take them hiking during the peak time. Dad ended up sleeping between Lt. Dan and the boys with me against the far side wall. Whew! That was a close one!Anyway, the boys returned with some awesome smelling brisket for dad. As he savored the tender smoked meat, Lt. Dan and I began to decide that the hike down and back up the mountain wouldn't be so bad without a heavy pack. With explosive compulsion driven by free food and real food fixed by someone else, Lt. Dan grabbed his trekking poles and nearly ran down the hill with me in hot pursuit. It was worth the trip. The brisket was excellent and with all the trimmings; ice tea, potato salad, Cole slaw, chips, and the absolute best baked beans I have ever had. There was a nice fire going, which warmed us as we gathered to talk about the Trail and learn about the people putting on the bash. One person, Ron, is full blooded Cherokee. I noticed he had a tear drop tattoo at the corner of his right eye. When I asked about it, he said it's in reference to the Cherokee Trail of Tears. I enjoyed talking to him about Cherokee history of the area. Sadly, I didn't get a picture of him. It was good to see Westy and his wife, Kathy, were parked near the food tent - score! - in their Volkswagen Westfalia camper van (hence, the Trail name Westy). Remember the nice lady who gave me a ride from Cooper Gap to Suches? Yea, that was Kathy. So, a great reunion it was with good laughs over this pitiful hiker begging a ride. By the way, Westy used to work for Procter & Gamble in the notlrtheast. I told him my uncle Kennie worked for P&G in Kansas City. Westy said he remembers Uncle Kennie from when Westy was at the KC, KS plant as part of a group to run production in the case of a strike. Knowing my uncle Kennie, that was quite a conversation and Westy didn't elaborate. I was at the campfire way too late. It was after dark when I noticed Lt. Dan's trekking poles were gone and he with them. Luckily, I had the rare good sense to bring my headlamp, so I bid our hosts a warm adieu and hot footed it back to the shelter. The climb up the mountain was dark and misty with my headlamp beaming through a heavy fog. Luckily, I got back to the shelter while everyone was still up, so I hung my bear bag and settled into my safely sequestered spot against the far wall.","Bly Gap

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525321,"Happy Easter from Standing Indian Shelter! The day broke with a heavy fog and misty on again, off again rain - North Carolina at it's best. Whoa! When I sat up from my sleeping pad, I almost fell over. That was weird. I layer down and got up again, I got a repeat. It felt like the shelter was on the high seas. This kind of freaked me out because I had the same feeling back in 2004 when I couldn't even lift my head from my pillow. I'll need to keep my eye on this.The foggy rain continued all day lending its own brand of magic to the Carolina mountains. The threat of heavier rain and possible thunderstorms in the late afternoon. I arrived at Carter Gap Shelter by 1:00 with the intention of having lunch and moving on. When I laid down on the shelter floor to rest before fixing my lunch, more spinning. Not good. The promised rain arrived, so I decided to hunker down for the day. I grabbed my spot in the shelter. In my Easter email exchange with Carolyn, I mentioned my vertigo. In less than ten minutes, Jack sent me a text with instructions and illustrations for exercises to overcome the vertigo. I performed the exercises a couple times before the shelter filled with sleeping bags. By 4:00 I'm shivering and a little concerned, so I slide into my sleeping bag.I'm pretty nervous about this vertigo.","Standing Indian Shelter

This mountain is the first big climb of the Trail with a bit of the steep boulder scrambling I'd expect in Pennsylvania or New Hampshire. Although only 0.2 miles, it's formidable at this point of the hike. Frankly, I didn't share the enthusiasm of the twenty-somethings around me.Just before the climb, I called Carolyn to check in. Call completed, it's time to get with it. The climb was tough, but only two tenths of a mile. My biggest issue was turning my head back and forth aggravated my vertigo. Slow and steady.I finally got to the top and the reward of a beautiful view. Westy arrived as I was getting my lunch out, so we enjoyed lunch with a view together. Westy is a great guy about my age and we hike about the same pace. He has definitely been a blessing on this travel.Lunch is done with the tough climb of the day bagged, it's time to get going. My plan was to hike to Long Branch Shelter for an 8.6 mile day.Problem: If I hike to Long Branch Shelter, that will make for a 7.3 mile hike on Tuesday to get to the Winding Stair Gap Trailhead and a ride into Franklin. Carolyn had made a reservation at the Franklin Microtel three days ago. I suggested the Microtel due to it's tactical proximity to Bojangles Chicken and Dairy Queen. For three days, now, the image of a plate of Bojangles chicken and its delectable sides with the after party of a Chocolate Xtreme Blizzard has been the proverbial carrot driving me on. If I have a 7.3 mile hike on Tuesday, I'll surely miss lunch! Onward, men! I dug my trekking poles into the Carolina loam and drove on to Rock Gap Shelter, giving me a short climb for the day and 3.8 total miles. You can do it, Comrade!!I made it to Rock Gap Shelter by around 5:00, satisfied, but too pooped to eat. That makes a grand total of food intake of oatmeal for breakfast and a foil of tuna on tortilla for lunch.The Rick Gap Shelter is located on a rocky hillside. With no room in the shelter and the two flat tent pads taken, I pitched my tent on the hillside. You can pitch a tent on what appears to be a reasonably level spot only to find, when you lie (lay?) down, you can feel a definite slant. Well, this hill looked to be at about a 20 degree incline. Based on experience, I pitched the tent with the head on the uphill side. When I got in the tent, I felt as though I was going to shoot off of my sleeping pad right down the hill. This is going to be interesting.A few days earlier, someone mentioned he put his backpack in the foot of his tent to raise his feet, thus arresting downward progress. I hadn't mentioned before, but part of the vertigo recovery recipe forwarded by my son recommends sleeping with your head raised like sleeping with two pillows. This will be interesting. My feet raised on my backpack and my head raised on my clothes bag. Alas, it didn't halt my vertigo or my downward progression. I spent the night climbing back up to my pillow in the equivalent of a tumbling Gemini capsule.Bojangles tomorrow!!","Carter Gap Shelter

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525326,"I haven't been able to update my journal due to poor connectivity on the Trail. The last previous update was 3/24.Franklin, North Carolina is about 10 miles east of the Winding Stair Gap trailhead parking. The city of Franklin has a wonderful $3 shuttle from the trailhead parking lot to wherever you need to go in town. I love this city! The shuttle leaves the trailhead at 9:30, 12:30, and 3:30. I figured if I got up at 7:00, I could be on the Trail by 8:00 and, after a leisurely hike of 3.8 miles over an average mountain, I could meet the 12:30 bus and be in town in time for a Bojangles lunch.At 8:00 I was on my way. Cool temperatures and a clear sky made for a nice walk. By 8:45 I had cleared the mountain and I began to think I could make the 9:30 shuttle. Time turn on the jets. The farther I went down the mountain, the more I thought I might actually make it with visions of a departing bus in a cloud of diesel smoke pushing me faster. I was no longer a hiker, I had become a trail runner with flashing trekking poles and the nimble foot placement of a Olympic athlete. Bojangles! became my war cry. A half mile from the parking lot, I could hear the card and trucks traveling on US 64, below. How much farther? Check your Guthook app with gps. No, fool, there's no time. Bojangles!A tenth of a mile from the foot of the hill, I can see the highway and barely make out the parking lot. It's 9:20. I'm almost there. Bojangles! What's that whipping feeling on your ankle? A couple quick glances reveal me left shoe lace has come untied. No time to stop and tie it. Just walk with your legs farther apart. You don't want to trip over your shoelaces, now, and break your neck. Bojangles!I arrive at the parking lot at 9:25 walking like a cowboy who had just ridden 800 miles. The bus arrived ten minutes later. I paid my $3 and was on my way.When I got to the Microtel, the package Carolyn had sent was waiting for me. I'd asked her to send my 3 liter water bladder. I've been using 2, 1 liter smart water bottles. The problem is, whenever I want a drink I have to stop, take off my backpack, drink, put on my backpack, and get on my way. That can take up to ten minutes. Additionally, I tend to not get a drink because of the loss of time, causing dehydration. This will be a big help.I also found in the box a surprise from Carolyn; two Russell Stover Easter eggs. Thanks, Carolyn!I had lunch at a BBQ place because of its proximity to the laundromat. Maybe I'll have Bojangles for dinner. I don't know, I'll decide later.I thought the vertigo was gone until I got up from my nap a little too fast and keeled over onto the bed. Not good. At least the room is on the level.","Rock Gap Shelter

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525455,"3/30: Zero day at the Microtel, Franklin, NC.The new shoe laces Carolyn sent are perfect. I did town chores; back flush my water filter, shower, rinse out my dirty water bags, shower, laundry, sleep, grocery shopping.I went to the Macon County Library to print out my Great Smoky Mountain National Park thru-hiking permit. This library is beautiful and looks like a lodge in a national park.I only had to shop for two days as I'll be resupplying at the Nantahala Outdoor Center, another two day hike and I'll be at Fontana Dam, gateway to the Smoky's.There's a Hiker Box at the Micromotel. A Hiker Box is a box where hikers can discard unwanted food & equipment which are then available, free for the taking, to other hikers. These boxes are often found in shelters and especially hostels, but I've never seen one in a motel. In this box I found an open box of rice, several clothing items and a fuel canister. I dumped several protein bars at the Wala-Yisi Center at Neel Gap. I forgot to mention in the 3/28 post that I dislocated my thumb trying to put my gloves on (all part of the experience!). Leaving Carter Gap Shelter in the rain, my gloves were wet. One negative review about my gloves is that the lining will come out when taking them off in the wet. Then, if you put them on in the wet & with wet hands, you can't shove the lining back in. So, at Carter Gap Shelter, with wet hands and in the rain, I was jamming my fingers into the glove. I was very close to success when I noticed the thumb on my right hand was over extended and I couldn't move it. I pulled it out of the glove to find it was dislocated. I grabbed with my left hand and shoved it back in place when, pop!, it went back out. Shove it back in place, flex it and forget about the gloves. After hiking 110 miles, I have a better feel for how to manage my gear.My feet & legs seem to be holding up. No pulled muscles and that tendon on the exterior left knee isn't any more sore than at home. I was going to buy a knee brace at Walgreens here, but decided to save my $$. I've found that a resting step helps the strain. One thing I've noticed, though, is the first knuckle on my right toe has been acting up. This is an injury from my 1994 airplane accident. In the past, it only acted up when I put on too much weight, so I suppose the weight of a ~40# backpack is included. There's nothing I can do about it. I hit the Trail tomorrow and 4-5 days until I get to the Smoky's with heavy rain and thunderstorms forecasted for the next two. I've been doing the Epley maneuver for my vertigo and it seems to have worked. That was pretty rough. I'll keep posting as long as I can get an Internet connection. So far, North Carolina has not been good. So, hang in there. Also, be sure to check out my photo page.","Winding Stair Gap

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525773,"3/31: Winding Stair Gap to Waya Bald ShelterThe day started cloudy with a slight breeze as the Franklin bus dropped me and Turtle off at the trail head at 10:00. Right away we passed over a beautiful cascading stream. These mountains are amazing. We were making good time and I could tell my body was rejuvenated from the day off; lots of rest and real food. I don't tend to eat well on the trail. I'm either too tired to fix dinner or to driven to get down the trail to eat breakfast or lunch. Consequently, by day three on the trail I'm struggling. I plan on changing that. By 11:00 we the wind picked up and by 1:30 we were in a complete downpour. We had already put our pack covers on and were wearing our rain gear. We were still making good time and I expected we'd make it to Waya Bald Shelter certainly by 5:00, even with the rain. The trail became very slick and we had to slow down for caution's sake. I slipped and fell in the mud a few times, but no worries except there went my laundry job. Being covered in mud made me think of my dad. He was a mechanic and it seemed the greasier he was when he got home, the bigger the smile on his face. My falls weren't falls so much as slides into second. Safe!Turtle and I arrived at the shelter at 4:00, but it was naturally full with 2 overflow already sleeping in the approach area. It was raining hard, now, and I was soaked through and starting to shiver. Turtle asked if we, too, could sleep on the ground and everyone agreed.We all took turns going to the privy to change our clothes and eventually I started to warm up. As I shivered, soaking wet in 50F temperatures, I was reminded that the biggest danger for hypothermia isn't when it's below freezing, but the exact situation I was in; 40'ish and wet. That really saps the heat from you.It was an interesting mix at the shelter. A couple from Australia. A young woman from Britain, and 4 or 5 Yanks. We quizzed each other about all kinds of stuff. Interesting conversation. The rain finally stopped and the overflow people pitched their tents. The forecast is for more storms tonight and tomorrow morning. Then, nice.","Winding Stair Gap

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525940,"4/1: Waya shelter to Wesser Bald shelter.What a storm we had last night! Big wind, hard rain and lots of it and lightning. I think this was the remnant of the storm that went through Wichita and Indianapolis. Luckily, we were on the leeward side of the hill and the wind went up and over us. My tent wasn't buffeted at all. But, boy, did it get wet! My tent has mud splatter all over where the rain splashed up under the rain fly. The inside was maybe a little damp, but not wet at all.I made the mistake of putting my socks on top of my shoes, which I keep outside the tent under the rain fly. When I wronged out my socks, I must have gotten a cup of water from each one. Since I have an extra pair of socks, I considered just putting on the dry six and packing the wet ones. With a forecast of more rain I decided that I would only end up with two pair of wet socks. So, I put back on my cold, wet socks. They warmed up quickly, so no biggie. However, by the end of the day they are smelling like someone else's wet mut. Today's goal was to get to Wesser Bald Shelter do we'd only have a short 5.8 mile hike down to Nantahala Outdoor Center. Westy reserved a 4 bed room for us, so we can stay out of the bunkhouse. So far, it's Westy, Turtle and me. Westy is trying to track down Fish 'n Chips for the 4th spot. Fish 'n Chips is a young guy with a tattoo on his right calf of a Christian 'fish' and 'n Chips inside of it.I saw my first Salamander today. They're very common in the Smoky's.I think today was the worst hike of the trip, so far. It wasn't the climbs, so much, although they were tough, it was the descents that killed me. My right leg from hip to foot is really hurting. My right hip was fractured in my airplane accident and it's been screaming for a few days, now. The first knuckle on my right big toe was also hurt in that accident and it's been hurting almost every step. My knees (both are arthritic) have cause some pain in the past, but the steep downhills are really causing them problems. Finally, I think I'm developing a shin splint in my right leg. All the old guys agree the downhills are torture. I almost called it a day at Tellico Gap, about 3.8 miles from my destination. Turtle came along and we couldn't find a decent place to set up tents, so off we go. I arrived at camp beyond spent and hurting bad. I set up my wet tent, hung my bear bag, and climbed into my sleeping bag. Since tomorrow's hike is short, I can take my time breaking camp in the morning.The water bladder Carolyn sent me has been a life saver. I'm now getting plenty of water while I hike because I don't have to take the time to stop, drop my backpack and pull my water bottle out.","Waya Shelter

Cotton,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526385,"4/2: Wesser Bald Shelter to Nantahala Outdoor CenterI slept well last night especially considering I pitched my tent on top of a fresh bear track the night before. Hey, it was about the only level tent spot at Wesser Bald and, in these mountains, you would almost wrestle a bear for a decent tent spot. After I hung my bear bag without eating dinner (again) I was all snug in my tent and changing into my sleep clothes, I found a Snickers mini in my pants pocket. Rats!! I did NOT want to get up and take down my bear bag to put this little wrapper in the garbage ziplock. I know, I'll just stick it in my wet, stinky sock. There is no olfactory on the planet earth that can make it past a pair of hiker socks. Nor would they want to. With my Snickers wrapper safely secured, I went off to sleep.The day dawned cool and clear. It was a great day for the the short hike to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) at the bottom of Wesser Bald. Although it was a steep downhill hike, I was driven by the NOC's reputation for killer hamburgers. Forget breakfast, on to NOC!My poor eating has been a problem for me. As of this morning, other than a package of cheese crackers and a half dozen Snickers mini's, I've only had a single serving of oatmeal (yesterday's breakfast) and a foil packet of tuna (yesterday's lunch). This would always catch up with me by day three out of town. Back at Bly Gap, Reboot told me her Fitbit showed she was burning about 4,500 calories a day. I was burning about the same. But, I was only taking in maybe 400 calories. That will catch up with you. Plus, my vertigo was back worse than before and my knees were taking a terrible beating from the steep (emphasis on steep) downhills. Other than losing my strength due to lack of nutrition, the downs are much worse than the ups.So, as I laid in my tent last night considering everything, I decided it was for the best I get off the Trail. The downhill scrambles are only going to get worse and I don't want to put myself in the situation where someone has to get me off a mountain because of injury. As I write this back home in Wisconsin, I'm disappointed, but I still feel it was the right decision.The NIC is at the confluence of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Smoky Mountains. The views are spectacular, but still more 'blue' than 'smoky.' There were a couple crazy scrambles down that made me think, ""Seriously? The Trail goes down there?"" Alas, it surely did and it was a killer on my knees. I knew there would only be more in the GSMNP not to mention the White Mountains. This pretty much cinched my decision to call it.I knew I was almost to the bottom of the mountain when I began passing a steady stream of day hikers on their way up. As the families and young couples gleefully passed me, I recalled what some thru-hiker once said, ""Day hikers smell good!"" It's true!At the NOC, the Trail crosses a feeder stream and rather suddenly empties out onto a busy three way intersection almost in the middle of NOC central; General Store, Outfitter, and Rivers End Restaurant. As I watched the parade of cars passing a full parking lot and the (clean and fresh smelling) 'tourists' milling about, the first thing that popped into my brain was, ""You mean I could have driven here?!?"" I had to laugh.I'd been planning and rehearsing my order of business all the way down the hill; eat lunch, buy a change of undies & shirt, shower, laundry.I bumped into Turtle at the Restaurant, so we shared a table and had lunch. Turtle was hiking on that day, so this was the last I would see of him.The NOC is a pretty cool place. Sitting on a very clear Nantahala River, it offers trout fishing (I saw some pretty nice trout from the foot bridge crossing the river), river rafting and kayaking. They even have an Olympic class kayak course. From the the comfort of the Restaurant, which is right next to the river, you can see the kayak course. It looked like fun until I watched a kayaker flipping over many times trying to make the chutes.Since the Trail passes right through the NOC plus the availability of large quantities of beer from the General Store, the NOC is a traditional party spot on the Trail. If you're under thirty and thruhiking the Trail, you cannot leave the NOC without your 'I got so hammered that..."" story. After I had my dinner and shower, I was walking down a steep hill to the General Store to do my laundry (item 4 on my list). As I approached a rather steep set of timber trail steps, a twenty-something hiker was halfway up and slowly struggling to make the top step. Just as he reached the top step, he teetered to his right, just catching himself with his trekking pole. ""Nice save!"" I thought to myself.""Tough hike today"", I said reassuringly (it was for me!) ""Not really"", the man slurred, ""I'm just drunk."" ""Well, that certainly raises the order of difficulty"", I replied."" ""Not really"" he dead panned as he turned the corner to follow the path up to the bunkhouse. Why hike the AT when you can get slobbery drunk at home, I wonder?Later in the day, I made contact with Villa Brewer who shuttled me to the Asheville airport the next day to meet the flight to Chicago Carolyn booked.That evening, I had dinner with Westy and said farewell to him the next morning as we went our deprecate ways; he toward Fontana Dam and the GSMNP and me to Wisconsin.","Wesser Bald Shelter
