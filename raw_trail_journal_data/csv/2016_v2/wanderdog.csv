wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517004,"I enjoyed attending the Appalachian Trail Institute, learning many things, meeting wonderful people, and capturing truisms of the trail. Here are some of them which resonate with me:1. walking the trail is not recreation, it is an education AND a job.2. Don't fight the trail, you have to flow with it.3. If your goal is to hike the entire trail, then do it. No point in cutting corners with blue or yellow blazes.4. The trail is a trial....liked this one....the Trail cannot be changed you must change to the trail.5. Be a smart hiker, not a strong hiker....given my age and starting physical condition, I'll have to be smart.DECISIONS (want to record these to see how they pan out during the hike):a. I choose to wear heavy boots. I need the ankle support and structural support for my feet.b. My goal is to carry 10 days worth of food with 17 mail drops. I'm still finalizing the list.c. I will filter my water with iodine back up...I view this as risk mitigation...I've come to hike not endure diarrhea.d. I am starting early to avoid crowds with March 5 as the date...I recognize I will experience cold weather and my pack will be heavier.e. As Yoda says: ""Do or do not, there is no try"". My goal is Katadin with three key benchmarks:    - Damascus, VA...from this point on, it is psychological...do the miles    - Skyland Resort in Shenandoah National Park...meet my wife.    - The Whites - got to get through the Presidentials...then onward to Maine",,Sound bites from ATI,"Nov 07, Sat",0

Learned much and solidified my position on approach to the trail after discussions of risk and comfort. Jennifer Pharr Davis also spoke and was great. It was a watershed moment for me, with all the aspects of preparation coming together.I plan to take a bus the evening of March 3 to Gainesville, GA, arriving around 1130 on the 4th and then get picked up by the folks at the Hiker Hostel.

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522835,Hiked today with Mudslide to Woody Gap and grabbed a shuttle 2 miles to a outfitter and a charge. Original plan was to lay up at Woody Gap then a short day to Jarrard Gap. The logistical challenge is two-fold: a requirement of having a bear canister to camp between Jarard Gap and Neels Gap which is a 5 mile trek over Blood Mountain. Rather than lay up a day to make the climb I pushed to Lance Creek and plan to go to a Neel Gap for a 7.4 mile must do hike.,"gooch mountain shelter

I had the tune from an old hymn stuck in my head: open my eyes that I may see. I believe the chorus ends with ""illumine me savior divine"". Also had a Bard Owl hooting and thought of my Dad's many years at White Haines Optical (WHO). I walked into sunrise and climbed Blood Mountain. Wonderful view but a challenging climb. And a challenging descent. I fell, no injuries (except ego) but I broke one of my hiking poles. Grrrrrr all the way down. Arrived at Neel Gap and went to Mountain Crossing outfitters for resupply. I asked for help with the pole and a Viking-looking guy was able to put a Leki bottom on the good Black Diamond top. Good to go with custom poles. A quick shower and wash, with 4 days of supplies and I was off. Lots of folks catching shuttles but I'm heading to Bull Gap.","Lance Creek

Ran out if gas on Wildcat Mountain. Ego says keep going but old guys rules say breathe. I have no where to be until October 15. Gear is holding up. Rained a little in the morning with fog and mist. Cleared up and we had a beautiful afternoon. And I took a nap. A little frustrated by how fast the battery goes but we'll try to solve that at Top of Georgia.

Day 6. What a day. I did 10.7 miles but have to add the 1.2 miles from Whitley shelter back to the trail. Terrain was reasonable after Low Gap shelter where I had lunch. The afternoon was a quest for sure. Camped above a small stream on a saddle around mile 49.8. Had a great day but tired. Not too sore. Feet a in good shape.","Whitley Gap Shelter

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523269,"Day 7. Started at what I thought was at a stream crossing at mile 49.8 but it was actually not as far, estimating 49.1 because I came across water and a camp site on my hike this morning. Water was a challenge and topped off at the spring and then hiked to blue mountain shelter for breakfast. Then a climb over Blue Mountain and a big descent to Unicoi Gap. I was running low on food and decided a resupply at Top Of Georgia. Grabbed their shuttle as other hikers were already waiting. Their stock of supplies were disappointing so I made the decision to grab my mail drop that was to be picked up on day 10. Also had a wonderful surprise. An encouraging note from the DeBaars. Thank you. Grabbed a shuttle back to the gap and climbed 740 feet to campsite called Cheese factory site. 7.5 miles today. Two more days and a zero day in Hiawasse.","little stream at approx 49.1

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523394,"Day 8. Another good day today. Water was a challenge as every source was off the trail at least .3 miles and downhill. Climbed Tray Mountain that was about 650 feet up. Not much but it was a climb straight out of camp at Cheese Factory. Nice surprise of trail magic at Tray Gap on the way up where the AT crosses a fire road. Had an apple and a nice visit. Hats off to #TrayGap2016. Bypassed Tray Mountain shelter, grabbed water at Steeltrap Gap. Climbed over Round Top, not much in elevation but a surprise. Made it to Addis Gap and followed a fire road .5 miles off the AT to camping and water. I have a nice campsite near a cascading stream, one kith say a babbling brook. It will be nice sleeping tonight. No cell coverage so I may hike back to the gap for a call home. JTotal AT miles today. 7.6. Walked back to Addis Gap but still was unable to get cell coverage. This is the first night I haven't been able to check in with home. I met Goat Gas and Princess camping at the Gap. At dinner they came down to get more water. Today I had thoughts of nice people who I had camped with, even hiked with, that are either ahead or behind:John or Mudslide who lives in Atlanta and got off the trail to retool. He is retired Army and had been struggling with arthritis. The last day we hiked together, he turned around on the trail and said he was able to close his fist for the first time in years. He got back on the trail at Woody Gap last Thursday. Jackie and David were are great couple. David was the shelter greeter as people came in. I haven't seen them or Stephanie (former Marine and hiking with a German Shepard) since Bly Gap, about a mile after Neels Gap.","cheese factory

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523397,"Day 9. Woke up to moderate showers around 4am. Tent did a good job keeping me dry. Woke up again at 7am and wondered why it was still dark then remembered one of the last things Linda said to me as I was getting ready on my last day at home: daylight saving time. Doh. Still dark and lost a hour of sleep. Plan was to stay at Top of Georgia tonight and had to make the 1230 shuttle. First, up Kelly Knob which is 800 feet climb in one mile in the rain. I love it BUT took it slow. Pack is very heavy from the wet tent. Managed at quick call home at Deep Gap and headed for Dicks Creek Gap with a descent of 1200 feet. Muddy.   Arrived 20 minutes late so a nice .5 stroll to the hostel. Shower, laundry and collect my mail drop. Found my bunk. Then set up my tent to dry it out. Caught the 4pm shuttle to Hiawassee for ribs and here I sit enjoying the quiet evening waiting to be picked up. Great day. Total miles only 5.4 and a zero day tomorrow for healing and errands.","Addis Gap
",Dicks Creek Gap,"Mar 13, Sun",5.40
wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523500,"Day 10. No miles today. They call it a zero day. Time to let body recover. I am grateful for no injuries. Many hikers struggling with knee issues after extreme downhill hikes. Transportation at little or no cost is a challenge. I took the free Hostel shuttle back to Dicks Creek Gap and then waited for the Budget shuttle to town. Success!!Laundry is done and first mail drop retrieved. I have to do some gear adjustments and send some minor things home. That's the plan. The execution of plan:Arrived at Budget Inn and it's a true half-star motel but with running water, a bed to sleep in and a ride back to the trail in the morning, it's a bargain. Walking around town to do errands and without a pack, it's a breeze. First, a stop at the library to compose a letter to the government to resolve a pay issue. They require a signed letter and copies of W2s. How to get that done?? Printed and signed the letter at the library and then walked to post office to mail home. The boss will add the documentation required and forward. While at the post office, grabbed two boxes, back to the hotel for a gear sort. Some stuff goes home and backup cold weather gear goes to Creekside Paradise on the AT, my next mail drop and overnight. I am saving almost 5lbs but still wanted the gear for the smokies. Still working on getting the supply logistics down. Adding a quick run into Franklin so I only have to carry 5 days of food. The town has a shuttle that runs back and forth for $3. Not bad. Then a few days of hiking to the NOC. The trail actually goes right through the facility. Hike some more to Creekside and then the smokies. Still haven't worked out a resupply in the smokies and I don't want to hitchhike to Gatlinburg. Feeling very good, no soreness other than a tight back. After all the wandering was complete, I headed back to the hotel, thunderstorms are approaching. As I round the corner at the motel, I see one of the room doors is wide open. I start counting room numbers. It's my room!! What is going on?? My door is wide open and there are locals in my room room. Panic!!! Warning!! Ok, just breathe, they are fixing my leaky shower. All is well at the garden spot in Hiawassee, Georgia.","Dicks Creek Gap

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523622,"Day 11. A few months ago I read two of Jennifer Pharr Davis' books. A quote from her 2nd book struck me about my endeavor to hike the AT: Quote from Called Again: ""it made me realize how much our culture is paralyzed by the fear of losing. I wasn't worried about not succeeding; I was worried about not trying.""I have dreamed of making this hike for over 3 decades.I am up early, waiting for breakfast and the shuttle. I am no longer fearful or worried. I have sensed God's presence, felt the support of family and friends, and a certain calm about heading back out. ""Time to stop talking and start walking""I walked 8.7 miles today. Not as far as I'd like but a good stopping point.   I'm amazed how hikers are driven to a gap where road and trail intersect, the hikers collect all their stuff and disappear into the woods. Today's hike felt like more up than down. We started at 2465 and ended at 3840. We'll be hiking at around 4000 tomorrow. The milestone for today: we walked into North Carolina. One state down, 13 to go. Still working on distance and timing for a trip to Franklin. I figure that will be the morning of day 16 but that puts me behind two days. Future journal entries will bear witness to my planned schedule versus walking reality.","Dicks Creek Gap

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523786,"Day 12. No cell coverage so uploaded on day 13. Long day today with a major climb out to Bly Gap. 800 feet in 1.3 miles all in fog an occasional rain. Then ridge running past Muskrat Creek shelter. Stopped for a break about a mile past Chunky Gal Trail. Yes, it's a real name. While sitting there a couple walks by and tells me that if I lost a red hat, it's laying by the Gal Trail cutoff. Doh!! That's my hat, a Christmas gift from my wife AND my primary cold weather hat. Stowing my backpack off trail, I begin to hike the mile back (yes, it's uphill) to retrieve my functional and sentimental object. About halfway back, here comes Nick and his superdog Morgan, with my hat tucked under his belt. Thanks dude. A little trail magic. Heading out I descended into Deep Gap at 4341 feet. Took off my boots and socks, and took a nap in the warm sun, having hikers shout their greeting: ""hello wanderdog, see you at the top"". From Deep Gap to my destination it's 5.3 miles with a climb to 5435 feet, top of Standing Indian Mountain, and then descend to Beech Gap at 4460 feet. Today was an emotional day with thoughts of my God and my wife. I have felt God's presence each day. Without my wife's support this year, I would not be able to complete the trip. More importantly, because of her excellent skills at managing money, we are in a position to take this trip. (Since this is a public blog, I'll leave at that but more was felt and said in a private email)Also, thanks to all for support and prayers. I am doing it, one step at a time.","Bly Gap

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523902,"Day 13. Another great day. Leaving camp, the first 4 miles were easy breezy. Walking through tunnels of what I believe to be Mountain Laurel, with their green leaves in through winter, it was beautiful. Nice break at Betty's Gap where I met Charlie and his dog Morgan and Kid and Pops. Nicks dog from yesterday is names Luna. But she's still a superdog. The easy ended at Albert Mountain with a moderate grade for the first 2 miles then a serious climb to the top. We made it. There was a great view if the valley and Franklin. Took a break with boots and socks off, soaking up sun, and enjoying the clearness of the day. Then headed down the hill for 2.4 miles to the Long Gap Shelter to set up camp, top off on water and prepare the evening meal. I had a chance to call home and share my thoughts from yesterday. Better said voice to voice than an email. I am actually setting my alarm for tomorrow morning. Trying to make the 1230 shuttle to Franklin for a quick replenish of supplies and return to the trail at 3pm. .Only 7.4 miles to hike. Yikes.","Beech Gap

I stayed at Long Branch Shelter, very nice, but still tented. Same mileage just the wrong name. The plan was to start hiking around 6am to catch the 1230 shuttle. I awoke at 330am, tossed and turned for 30 minutes and decided to pack up. On the trail by 420am, using the headlamp to hike. I hiked almost 4 miles in the dark with the sun rising around a mile past Wallace Gap. Then lamp off for the big descent into Winding Stair Gap for the 0930 shuttle. Amber and her Shitzu, Theodore were already there. Folks start arriving for a total of about 12. Nick and Luna heading in for a zero day   A timely departure to a Franklin, NC, for some errands. First, an outfitter for meals and a water filter cartridge. No luck. I'll have to try the NOC in 3 days. Jumping from plug to plug to charge the phone, I went to the coffee shop for chai tea and a Danish. A few emails and then on to the 50s diner for lunch: ""yes mam, I can sit anywhere as long as there's a plug"". I had section to myself. Most excellent burger. Then a cruise to ingles for toilet paper and baby wipes (my shower each day). I walked out of the store and the return shuttle appears just for me. Linda, the driver, always wanted to hike the AT but says she's too old now. Hmmm, she was younger than me. Just a short walk in. But a shout and wave from Charlie, who was coming out of the woods as I was entering the other side. Organized my gear, took a nap, washed my socks and cleaned up. Just 7.9 miles today.

Yesterday I felt lethargic in the morning but hiker 14 miles. Today I hiked 11.9 to A. Rufus Morgon Shelter which is 1 mile short of the NOC. Everybody is headed there because of snow forecast for this evening. It was a challenge staying warm today. Polypropylene sleeveless base with two smart wool tops and smart wool long johns. Had to wear my raincoat for wind and snow pellets, which led to wet undergarments. Hung them but they didn't dry before I climbed into my sleeping bag. To save weight, I didn't bring a heavy jacket or fleece so the only refuge is the sleeping bag. Stopped around noon to prepare a full meal. Stephenee and her German Shepard caught up with me and joined me for lunch. Then she was gone......Planning to stop at the NOC for small resupply. I am one day behind schedule and hope to be at Creekside Paradise on the 23rd or day 19.

Good morning!!A quick 1-mile hike to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) for breakfast and resupply. Solved my rain coat problem with fabric tape. Good coaching from the NOC folks. Headed out for a big climb to Sassafras Gap Shelter. Cold long climb with high winds and snow and ice on the ground. Tried to dry my layers when I arrived. They are still damp. Let myself get too cold and waited to long before I jumped in the sleeping bag. Brrrr. It has taken about an hour to warm up. Hiked 7.7 miles today with a tough climb. Start tomorrow with a climb to a peak. Still no purifier cartridge so I purchased a mini sawyer as backup. Will need to get tablets for the smokies or find the cartridge as the sawyer doesn't stop the virus threat. It's a traffic jam at the shelter because everyone compressed at the NOC last night.

And I did a lot of praying because I had to work for every mile. Some days I am able to detach and put my legs on cruise. Not today. The day was blue sky with a light southwest wind. Although I hiked in snow and ice whenever the trail was on the north side, most of the time it was a nice weather day. Had lunch at Simp Gap   A nice spot in the sun to relax for a few. Then the descent into Stecoah Gap for water which was needed. And some trail magic of apples and bananas. Then onward to Jacobs Ladder, the climb everybody was talking about. Fear sets in. Will I make it? I've already done 8 miles. I pushed up, taking my time. I hiked the whole ascent without encountering another person but I was not alone. Arriving at Brown Fork Gap Shelter, i was the first one there. Weird, there were several people ahead of me. Then Two Soles (formerly Blue), Waterboy and Lemonhead show up with smiles. Someone picked them up at the Gap and brought them to town for pizza. They are good guys. I have an easy day tomorrow as I am picking up mail drops at Creekside Paradise on the AT and spending the night there. I have had many offers from folks wanting to send stuff. All is good. Anything sent is something I have to eat on the spot or carry. If I have a need, I will ask and coordinate with ground support (my wife). Prayers and support are valued.

A quick call to Creekside Paradise on the AT and I was on my way to a beautiful cabin home. Met Jeff, the owner, and immediately felt welcome. I am the only guest. Chores. Took a shower. Awesome. The woods doesn't smell that bad. Then washed everything I carried. What did I wear? Town clothes from one of my boxes. Sorted through my boxes. Surprise!!! A apple carefully wrapped, sunflower seeds and cheddar cheese sticks, all consumed immediately. Then to sort the food. 1 day to get to Fontana Shelter, 8 days to get through the smokies and 3 to get to Hot Springs, my next mail drop.

Gear is sorted, pack is heavy, but I am lighter (and gray). I haven't had my hair or beard this long in years. Goatee notwithstanding, I am very gray. Ouch!! Jeff drove me to town for the post office run and he's getting groceries. This is an awesome place. I hope to visit with my wife. They have thru-hiker rates. $60 for a bed, shower, laundry, run to town (robbinsville), breakfast and 2-mile shuttle to and from trail. Very nice. This is the first time I've sat in a chair in over a week. As I type this, I am sitting on the front porch in the sun, the stream flowing in front of the house, no boots, gear is ready and dinner soon. Can't stay too long or I'll stay another day. Thank you Creekside Paradise on the AT. An excellent alternative to Fontana.   ","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525163,"Day 20 and 21. Ended at Russell Field Shelter. Tough two days , physically and emotionally. Big climb from Fontana Dam, weakness from losing weight, rain and high winds. In the smokies with marginal cell coverage. Next post will be in Gatlinburg for resupply (3 Days?). Thanks to DeBaars for letter. Prayers for Mike. Prayers for Jim.","Yellow Creek Road

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525164,"Day 22. Hiked 8.9 miles, tough terrain, still struggling with being emotional, doubting my self and lacking gumption to climb the hills ahead of me. Ran into Chloe, an AT Ridgerunner and had a nice chat. She said to embrace the emotion. Having a hard time with appetite. I know I must eat, but I have to force myself to eat the entire portion. And I don't think I'm drinking enough water. My Katadin Hiker cartridge failed today. But I have the backup mini Sawyer which works fine. Stopped at Derrick Knob Shelter tonight and it is packed. Found a nice tent site and all is good. My choices tomorrow are hiking 7.4 miles or 13.5   The long distance would require a climb of Clingmans Dome. Don't think I ready for that. Mudslide, now know as Owl, caught up today. It was good to see him. Reread the card from my wife and the nice note from the DeBaars. Prayers for Mike. Prayers for Jim.","Russell Field Shelter

Owl hiked with me today just to coach and assist. He was very kind. Got to Silers Bald Shelter and could go no further. Stripped off wet clothes and jumped into sleeping bag for two hours. It is the first time I was concerned. Am I able to continue? I have very little appetite and know I am not drinking enough water. Managed to eat 800 calories this evening. Still raining and cold. I will assess in morning.","Derrick Knob Shelter

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525251,"Day 25. I don't know when I first started thinking about getting off the trail. A few days ago I was on top of Rocky Top, pack off, laying in the grass to catch my breath. A hiker came by and asked if I were ok. I thought ""no"" but said I was fine. Two nights later I was in my sleeping bag, thinking about the climb of Clingmans Dome and being angry at myself for my fear of climbs and fear of stopping. Yesterday morning, in my heart, I made the decision to stop at the sign about .5 miles south of the Dome. I had made the climb to Mount Buckley and was ridge running. There is a note in the ATGuide that says ""NoBo:AT is the left fork of this intersection"". The poem Road Less Traveled came to mind. I went right, headed for the visitors center. I have left my thru hike. I am sad and disappointed in myself but know it's the right decision. No excuses nor rationalizations. I was not prepared enough physically or mentally. I'd like to add some humorous quip but none come to mind. Thank you to all for encouragement and support. AND prayers. I have done much talking with God over the last three weeks, expressing gratefulness and asking for help. A life-long dream put to rest without success. It is time for me to still and know that He is God.","clingmans dome parking lot

wanderdog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525593,"I arrived home yesterday, getting to the Woodbridge bus station around 10am. My wife arrived shortly thereafter, and we had a quick ride home. The bus trip overnight from Knoxville was OK, didn't sleep much, and had feelings of regret.But regret is a waste of spirit. While I'd like to still be on the trail, it was good to be home. I took a shower and took a nap.A buddy and I will go on a day hike next week, climbing Old Rag in Shenandoah. Thus ends my thru hike journey. I told my wife I plan to do some section hiking this year. She stated that she'd like to go back to the Smokies, drop me off at Clingmans Dome parking lot and have me finish the AT in the smokies. I can do that....Thanks to all that encouraged and supported and prayed for me.AND thanks to all of those people I encountered on the trail.","home
