Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514055,"I have wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail since high school. My brother gave me the Sierra Club publication of 'On The Loose' and planted the seed. Still have that book. But somehow time and money were never together at the same time, then my son was born and life just kept happening. So this year, I am giving myself the gift of starting the trail for my (gasp!) 60th birthday. Actually I will be starting before my birthday as I'd like to finish a good section hike before it gets too hot. Kind of crazy excited about the idea of finally beginning this hike. Would love to be able to do this as a thru hike but my job doesn't give me that kind of flexibility. Lucky for me I'll be able to retire soon (well in two years) then I can dive into the trail for as long as I want. Looking forward to the adventure, friendship, challenge and beauty.""We live in a house that God built but that the former tenants remodeled - blew up, it look like - before we arrived. Poking through the rubble in our odd hours, we've found the corners that were spared and have hidden in them as much as we could. Not to escape from but to escape to : not to forget but to remember. We've been learning to take care of ourselves in places where it really matters. The next step is to take care of the places that really matter. Crazy kids on the loose; but on the loose in the wilderness. That makes all the difference.""    - Terry Russell",,View Entry,"Sep 21, Mon",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514133,"Spent some time hiking Mount Ranier several years ago. Unfortunately, couldn't hike to the glaciers as it had been an exceptional snow year and there were 14' of snow at Paradise in June. The hiking at the lower elevations was absolutely amazing. Waterfalls every time I turned a corner and I was lucky enough to get a really clear day and a phenomenal picture of Ranier itself. I hiked 20 miles over two days with no problem straight from a desk job so I know I can get in shape to do this. I have to say as I read the journals that the AT sounds much more challenging. But I have been reading BonBon's trail journal and she gives me hope that I can do this too. I have a co-worker who hiked about half of the AT and trains scouts in backpacking. He is going to get me trail ready. I think he even mentioned 'training'. I'm actually so stoked about this that training sounds good. I promised I would only window shop gear and read Uncle Tom's trail journal to get smarter about what I need. I'm on it!",,View Entry,"Sep 22, Tue",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514561,I am both thrilled and overwhelmed with the amount of information that is available for me to learn how to plan for my section hike. It is daunting but certainly better than not having information available. Thanks to all who have posted trail journals I can learn from!,,View Entry,"Sep 27, Sun",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515169,"Good thing I like to read. There is so much information available and I am getting immersed in books on gear, hike planning, and how to make my own trail meals. Tent or hammock, quilts or sleeping bag, down or synthetic - the choices are endless but i am learning a lot.Also upping my workouts as I start preparing physically. Lots of stair climber workouts, weight lifting and walking. Unfortunately, it is flat as a board where I live in South Carolina but it is still nice to know I can walk 3.5 to 4 miles an hour for several hours without hardly elevating by breathing rate. I'd say without breaking a sweat but I sweat easily. I guess that means I cool efficiently, right?Planning a visit to REI next month to spend some time trying on shoes, boots and backpacks. I'll start there and work from there.",,View Entry,"Oct 04, Sun",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516210,"My planning is progressing well. Starting to build my gear list and my initial plan for the hike. Building my workouts which include stair climbing in the gym and climbing the stairs along the Savannah River Walk on my work breaks. Even my husband said these are very like steep trails and good practice. They are old stone steps with higher step ups than current codes so it is a good workout. 
I had a little setback this week. Strained my back yesterday and am laid up for at least a few days. Never had back pain like this so let's hope four days of rest will have me back on track. Now that I have plans taking shape, I can't imagine being delayed in starting this adventure. In fact, I have already made reservations at the Hiker Hostel for my last pre-hike training which will be hiking the trail from Amicalola Falls to Springer Mountain. That will be my last opportunity to train, test my equipment and be ready to start in May.",,View Entry,"Oct 23, Fri",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517040,"Had to travel to Phoenix for work on Nov 2nd so I took the opportunity to spend some quality time at REI. Tried on just about every hiking shoe they had but bought the first pair I tried, the Lowa Renegade. They are a bit heavier than I wanted but they are soooo comfortable. Took them to Camelback mountain Friday and hiked to the top and down again. Felt as comfortable when I got back to the car as when I left. And Camelback was an awesome workout. If I could do it twice a week until May, I would be really fit to hike.",,View Entry,"Nov 08, Sun",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517869,"So you may ask what that thing in the picture is and why is in my AT journal? Some of you may know what it is and are still asking what it is doing here. The answer is that I live in South Carolina where hills are few and the closest training hikes that even vaguely resemble the AT are 3 to 5 hours away. So.... I got creative. The A-Frame in the picture is part of the equipment my dogs train on for agility courses. After studying the structure, I decided it could be my trainer too (steel frame looks strong enough to hold me). I had to brace it with fence poles as it is a bit wobbly (top heavy) when I get to the top and me falling over with the frame seems counterproductive to training. The 'turbans' on the fence poles are to hopefully prevent fatal injury should I get clumsy and fall on one of the poles. 
Of course, the main advantage is the mental training. This has to be the definition of PUDs right? Except it really isn't pointless if it makes me more fit for hiking right. I will say my dogs are just about rolling on the ground laughing. I keep waiting for them to give me treats each time I go over. No telling what the neighbors think.
Backpack arrived today so I can start increasing my training by wearing it too.",,View Entry,"Nov 30, Mon",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519474,"So one of the hardest gear decisions to make was whether to use a hammock or tent. Both have pros and cons but one of Uncle Tom's journal entries finally tipped the balance for me. He said he went from a hammock to a tent because he really liked having access to his stuff at night. For me, I really want a space where I can sit, read, write and sleep with bug protection around me and the first three are harder in a hammock (from my perspective). Plus I really think it would be nice to be able to change and take care of personal stuff in private - again harder to do in a hammock. So I found a tent that is actually lighter than the hammock I would have chosen and it uses my trekking poles rather than dedicated poles. 
Being the engineer that I am, I figured out the distance and elevation that I am covering when I use my mini mountain (A-frame) for exercise. Currently I am going up and over a bit over 300 times per session with my backpack on, weighing about 15 lbs. For each 300 PUDS, I go about 1.02 miles and have a change in elevation of 1050 ft. up and 1050 ft. down. So that is a 1050 ft. change in elevation per half mile. Better than walking on the flat in the low country.
I've given a lot of thought to my goals for this hike too. Certainly I have a physical goal in terms of miles I'd like to reach, but I also want to enjoy the time on the trail and appreciate the beauty around me. It is such a gift to have the time away from work to simplify my life to the basics - walk, food, sleep and nature. I don't want to squander that gift by focusing so hard on making the miles that I don't see the details of the environment I pass through. Even on my training walks at home, I attend to the sounds of the wind in the trees, the water running through the marsh and the animals that I see in the woods. Several weeks ago, as I was walking down the road, a bobcat jumped on the road in front of me, followed by her three kits. The kits were about half grown. I froze to avoid scaring them and I so wanted to take a picture, but was afraid they would be gone the minute I moved. One of the kits did turn his head to look at me. Such awesome animals and beautiful. I have never seen a bobcat before so this chance crossing of our paths was simply amazing to me. I was able to enjoy watching them for a little over a minute before they disappeared into the woods on the other side of the road. It was the highlight of my weekend.",,Gear and other prep,"Jan 10, Sun",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527088,"Can't believe it is only three weeks to start my hike. Been very busy getting ready. Food is dehydrated, dinners made and all packed into daily bags. The food is about on target for weight - about one pound per day, about 2500 calories average. Tried most of the meals as I made them and only one didn't pass muster. The recipe had dehydrated mushrooms in it. Mushrooms aren't really my favorite and they were a little bitter upon rehydration. Best dishes have dehydrated quinoa in them. The quinoa dehydrates and rehydrates very well. So that chore is mostly done. Now to pack boxes, make labels and have them ready to ship.
Everything else is coming together well. I have a few more littles to add to my backpack but it is pretty much all in place. I am somewhere between excited and terrified. I will say I am in just about the best shape I've been in years. My husband says I am thinner than when he met me. Could be true. Cholesterol is down too. So the pre-benefits of this adventure are well worth the journey.
Back to work and more to come.",,Getting close...,"Apr 09, Sat",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529744,"Two weeks out from my planned departure date and I popped a tendon in my knee. I was very close to tears over this but I had been ignoring a sore muscle in my knee, undoubtedly from over training. So in the long run, it is better this happened now and not on the trail. Was on crutches for a week but, with physical therapy, this is healing much faster than I thought it would. So my focus is on healing this completely, including the strained muscle, before I start hiking. I want this to be a good experience. I certainly don't want to be crawling down the trail with a loaded pack trying to get to a ride back to my car.
Food is packed and ready to go. Backchecking my gear, especially the little stuff so I'll be ready when the knee is ready.",,Bump in the Road,"Apr 25, Mon",0
Phoenix,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537490,Two months of PT and the knee is still a problem. I finally had an MRI several weeks ago and just met with the doctor today. Turns out there is a fracture in the tibia. So looks like an arthroscopic procedure is in my future and it may be some time before I can be ready for backpacking. I just have to remind myself I'll appreciate the hiking more by having to wait and work for it I suppose. It is possible I could do some short hikes in October but I'm just going to have be patient with the process. Very much enjoying enjoying this year's hiking by reading everyone else's journals.Happy trails.,,Bigger Bump in the Road,"Jun 09, Thu",0
