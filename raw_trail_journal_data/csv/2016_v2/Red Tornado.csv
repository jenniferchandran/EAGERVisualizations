Red Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523204,I went to Guadalupe National Park this past weekend and hiked. It was pretty windy but sun was out so it turned out to be a really nice day. It's the perfect place for a good workout.,"

Red Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523767,Left Sunday afternoon headed to Guadalupe NP to hike the peak again. Started out early Monday morning and was blessed to have perfect weather. Guadalupe Mtn are noted for extremely high winds. Hiking the peak is quiet a challenge 8 miles rt with a 3000 ft elevation gain. On Tuesday morning before leaving drove to Mckitrick Canyon which is still part of Guadalupe National Park. It is a much more relaxed hike and a good way to end the trip and head home.,"

Red Tornado,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528872,"This is Red Tornado's daughter, Cinthia placing this entry on behalf of my mom per her request. For those who don't know, unfortunately mom suffered a serious injury on the 4th day into her hike. Mom took a fall and fractured the C2 vertebrae in her neck. EMS did get to her and she was air lifted to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga, TN. We feel very blessed and are very thankful she did not suffer any spinal cord injury but it was still very serious and required surgery. The doctor initially tried to go through the front of her throat but the screw would not take because her bone was too soft so they had to do a second surgery through the back of her neck. The second surgery went very well and she is as good as could be expected at this time. As you know mom is very independent and determined so the outlook for her recovery is very optimistic. Mom will complete her 2 to 3 week rehab at Siskin Rehab right next door to Erlanger. Once mom completes rehab in TN she will return to Wichita and stay with my brother, Mark to finish her recovery with family. Many people have already asked about cards. I will post an address once she is settled at Siskin or you can mail them to me at: 2641 N. Garland Ave. Wichita KS 67204 and I will make sure she gets them. I get mail for my mom all the time so the post office is used to it. In lieu of flowers (because it would be too difficult to get them back to Wichita) we ask you send a donation to the Appalachian Trail in her name. I know the Red Tornado and her family greatly appreciate all the support and prayers that have started to come in. I will continue to post weekly updates on her behalf until she is able to do so herself. Again we want to thank-you for all the support and love being sent her way!  ","Hawk Mtn campsite

Again, we truly appreciate all the support and prayers.      ","
