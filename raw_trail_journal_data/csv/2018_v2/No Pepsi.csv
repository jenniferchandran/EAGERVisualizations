No Pepsi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582048,"I have most of my gear already.  But I was looking at getting a couple upgrades.  I ordered a new hiking hat with a mesh bug guard inside it.  In 2003 I had a regular bucket hat I used for sun and rain protection and a dorky green baseball style cap with a pouch in front that contained a bug net.  Hopeful my new hat will serve both purposes.  When the weather gets warmer, the gnats and mosquitos can be maddening.  They will get right in your face and go in your eyes and ears.  Fingers crossed this will be a good purchase.I also ordered the 2018 AT Guide.  This is a book I will carry that will tell me where food and water can be found. It provides mileage for the trail.  Tells you were campsites, shelters and road crossings are.  It's a necessity to have one. I can't imagine how early thru hikers were able to hike the AT without a guide book.  On a side note, the AT Guide is a creation of AWOL.  AWOL hiked the AT with me in 2003.  He also sent me a free copy of the 2017 AT Guide which helped me prepare for my hike.  Thanks AWOL, that was very nice of you. I need to order some new glove liners and I'm still thinking about getting a new winter hat for my hike.  I've got to protect my money maker. :)","

On a side note, I'm planning on referring to myself in the third person.  Like Jimmy on the Seinfeld episode.   ""No Pepsi's down!!""  ""No Pepsi's hungry"" or ""No Pepsi's feet hurt""   Just sayin

I got a new rain/sun hat for this hike.  It has a built in bug net that pulls out of a compartment on top of the hat.  Very cool.  Trying to decide what other stuff I need to buy,  probably will only be some new socks and such at this point.
Several people had asked me about mail drops.  For those of you that didn't follow my past hikes,  there are places along the trail that I can receive packages. These package should read 
Stephen Bryant
General Delivery
City, State  zip code
and should have ""hold for AT hiker"" written on them.   
What you should consider if you want to send something to me is.... is this something I would want to lug over mountains in a backpack.  During my hike in 1993, a friend sent me a bunch of photos of the two of us together.  While it was very nice of her to think of me and send them to me, I had to throw them away.  Pretty much if it's not edible or disposable, you probably shouldn't send it to me.  There was a silver lining to this story.... receiving the photos and having to toss them in the garbage inspired me to invent the edible postcard. 
You can reference the ""Mail Drops"" option in this journal to see where I will be getting mail. (and get addresses)","

No Pepsi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582810,"It's common for first time thru hikers to have feelings of inadequacy when starting out on the AT.  You run into other hikers who project a more rugged outdoorsy image and think..""what am I dong out here?""  I remember my first backpacking trip was in 1993 and I was attempting to hike the AT.  There was another hiker out there who looked like the ultimate outdoorsman wearing camouflage and military clothing, long flowing hair and carrying a huge knife on his belt.  He had a very rugged trail name like ""US Steel"" (not his actual name, but something in that vein) and I thought he was the picture of an AT Hiker and I was not.There was another hiker that year,  she was a overweight 50 something woman from WV named Rachel.   I quit my hike in Pennsylvania that year, US Steel didn't make it out of NC.  Rachel?  Made it all the way to Katahdin.   My point is..  You can never predict who will complete a thru hike on the Appalachian Trail. If you got your shit together enough to start a thru hike,  you can do just as well as anyone out there. What does it take to complete a thru hike,  you need to really want to finish a thru hike and you need to be really stubborn.  Most of all you need a little luck.  I hiked with a woman in 2003 who was in her 60s.  She had to quit her thru hike in NH because she kept falling down and eventually broke some ribs and had internal bleeding.  She made it all the way to NH but didn't finish the trail  But I'll tell you, she was a really nice lady and was as tough as a pine knot.  You can do everything right and it can be over if you have a little bad luck.  That being said, you can do a lot wrong too,  make sure you are prepared. Under 6 weeks to go before I start my hike.  Hoping to get out on some weekend hikes over the next 6 weeks.","

But there is a big difference between camping in the rain on a thru hike and camping in the rain over a weekend trip.When I first hiked in '93, I did have a few times where I had to hike all day in the rain and a couple times when I was forces to hike in thunderstorms.  Both are not generally pleasant to me. However when I hiked the AT in '03, we had record amounts of rain that year.  The Roanoke Virginia newspaper said it had rained 21 days in the month of May that year.  It was pretty miserable. I'm crossing my fingers that hiking the AT in 2018 is a reasonably dry experience.  However, based on the month of February, things are not looking promising.  Uggghhh!Just over 4 weeks to go until I leave Nashville!!","

Cross your fingers the forecast changes. Its no fun backpacking in the rain.I just went to REI and bought two pairs of hiking socks and two pairs of sock liners.  Those were the last items I needed to get for my hike.  I'd considered just using my old socks and liners and decided not to skimp on something so important.  So even with my REI dividend and a 10% off coupon it was over $50!!  Money well spent.  7 more workdays after today.  Clearing everything out of the house this weekend.  It's getting close to go time!!Thanks to Daliah Macon and Lloyd Caufield for allowing me to store some of my stuff at their houses while I'm homeless.  Thanks to Chuck Higgins for letting me stay at his place a couple nights before I leave town.A special thanks to my fellow 2003 thru hiker Last Minute for doing my mail drops and resupply for me.  He is also taking me to Springer next week.  I appreciate all the assistance LM!","

Under the heading of ""who's the biggest idiot on the trail in '18"", guess who forgot to bring fuel along for his hike. You guessed it. All will be ok, first store is in 30 miles. I have food I can eat until then.

Camped at Justus Creek with Adam. For being the second day of the trail, I had a big mile day. I did almost 11 miles. I am meeting hiking friends from '03 tomorrow morning at Woody Gap and wanted to get closer to the meeting point. But when I started to hike away from Justus Creek, I realized I was out of gas and couldn't go any further. 6 miles tomorrow to hook up with those guys. Switchback and Last Minute are going to be feeding the hikers at Woody Gap. 
There are also a group feeding hikers at Gooch Gap which is 2.4 miles away from me. A friend I went to college with has a ministry that comes out to feed the hikers. So tomorrow I will get my first feed the hikers trail magic ever. 
Weather is cold and I am feeling every bit my age so far. But I have done more miles so far than any of my other two hikes over the same timeframe. So far no rain, two cold but sunny days.","Stover Creek

Camped again last night.  I am spending my first night inside tonight.  Due to a rashy situation I really needed to take a shower and get dried out.   Had my first rain today,  not too bad.  Still cold too, but not intolerable. 
I also had my first feed the hikers experience today.
Had breakfast at Gooch Gap with James Evans and his group from Benchmark Ministries. I went to college with James many years ago.  I got to visit a little while with James and Robert Poole (also went to college with).  Thanks James for the hiker feed,  it really means a lot to a thru hiker to come across one of these. 
Then hiked 3.5 miles to Woody Gap to meet my hiker friends from '03 Switchback and Last Minute and their families. They had a huge spread at Woody to feed the hikers.  I ate well today.  
I got a ride with Switchback to Vogel St Park and got a cabin.  I'm now clean and dry and going to let some of the muscles heal.  Thanks for taking care of me Switchback.","Justus Creek

After waking up this morning, I did my laundry then was going to hitchhike up to Woody Gap to start hiking.  I  couldn't believe I wasn't able to get a ride after 90 minutes of trying.  I finally got a professional shuttler to stop and I negotiated a price with him. 
While I was  hitchhiking the weather was fairly good and the sun came out a couple of times.  When I got back to Woody Gap, there was pea soup fog and they were calling for freezing weather and snow.  It wasn't a tough decision for me to go with other hikers to a hotel.  So Im in Blairsville GA with Dorothy, H.A.M and the Austin girls.
So those of you surely keeping score, that's two nights in a tent and two nights inside. 
Hopefully the weather is improved.","

Camping north of Hogpen Gap 
I got a late start leaving Neels Gap and was able to do about 7 miles in very nasty weather. Still no sun, cold, extreme fog, and sleet. Ended up setting up my tent about 6 inches from the trail in the soup. UggPr","

Woo Hoo, 50 miles dow!! Did 11 big miles today. Still not making the miles I would like and not moving very fast at all. Sometimes only a mile an hour. The hiking is still very hard for me. I told myself the first three weeks would be miserable physically, I hope things improve. I can't get to Maine at this pace. 
Woke up to the extreme fog and sleet. Tent and all my gear was wet an muddy. Weather as bad as you can imagine. Morning hike was pretty miserable. Then the skies cleared the sun came out a little and the temp warmed up. Still haven't been able to hike in shorts, but the weather is better. 
Another problem is the number of people on the trail. It's crazy. there must have been thirty people at the shelter last night. I ate dinner, got water and hiked on the the nearest campsite. I'm also hating the crowds. The first night on the trail at Stover Creek shelter, there were 20 people. In 1993 at Stover Creek Shelter, there were 3 hikers. Really hope the crowds start getting smaller.

Short day into Helen Ga. Helen is a tourist town with a Bavarian theme. I hadn't visited Helen on either of my hikes, so I really wanted to check it out this time. Did a short hike for a rest day and heading out tomorrow. Two big mountains to climb tomorrow. 
Lots of cool stuff in Helen, it's like a small Gatlinburg. 
Shared the room with Lance from Kansas.Cool story,  I had met an older hiker in Blairsville and after several attempts to find out where he was from,  I found out he was from Cookeville, TN.  About an hour from Nashville.  I ran into him again in Helen and found out his real name is....  Stephen Bryant.  What are the odds of that.  Pretty wild.","
