Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584195,"We’re starting off the new journal for our 2018 AT hike full of optimism, enthusiasm, and excitement.  After the disappointment of last year’s medical issues (mine this time), we’re both back in good condition and looking forward to this year’s hike.  We’re aiming for a mid-April start to avoid possible wintry conditions, but still allow for a couple months of hiking before the summer heat becomes intolerable.  At our extreme age, we don’t handle extreme temperatures very well.
We’re still planning to use our car as a mobile “bounce box” full of all the supplies we’ll need for the hike.  That way we’ll have access to our heavier cold weather gear at the beginning and lighter warm weather gear when the time comes without mail drops or additional purchases.  Also, since we like to have a Mountain House meal at the end of each day, we have a 2-month’s supply already in the car, so we won’t have resupply problems along the way.
According to weather reports and current hikers’ journals, this season has been very cold and wet so far.  And so, we’re optimistic that warmer weather will arrive within the next month, but leave behind abundant water sources along the trail.  We’re excited about the prospect of hiking through a magnificent spring bloom in VA, as well as finally getting to see the wild ponies in the Grayson Highlands.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Thu",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584505,"With less than a month before our hike begins, we are mostly ready.  We don’t need to add many supplies.  Our gear is sufficient and well tested, and we still have all the Mountain House meals we expect we’ll need.
But we have been working on our fitness for the last couple of months.  By spending the winter months in warm Florida, we’ve been able to take long bicycle rides.  Our scenic tour rides are usually about 24 miles, and we do that two or three times a week.  In addition, we’ve been working of strengthening our core and leg muscles to improve balance and stamina.  The added benefit is that Woofie has dropped 10 pounds since January, so that’s less weight to haul up and down the mountain trails.",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Tue",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585419,"We’re back home in MD and finally getting some spring-like weather.  Last night was a rare and wondrous sight: a super blue moon.  What could be better than that!  Well, how about a hike on the AT.
April starts tomorrow, Easter Sunday.  And that reminds me that it’s my late parents’ wedding anniversary.  My mom always remembered her beautiful Easter Wedding. But my dad always remembered his anniversary because it was April Fool’s Day.  And that also means there are only two more weeks before we start our hike for this year.
We still have all our gear and supplies that were meant for past failed hikes, so we’re hoping that the third time will be the charm.  But we are adding lightweight multi-sport gloves this year, fleece gloves with waterproof shells.  We’ve learned that April showers in the mountains can make very cold hands.",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586352,"We spent the last week in NY State where we grew up.  My home town is Warwick, NY, which is just off the AT a couple miles.  I had to run an errand in Vernon, NJ, so I crossed the AT twice where the AT crosses Rt 94 near Vernon.  Last spring we hiked south a small section from Rt 94 on a day hike.  The photo shows a raised board walk that traverses a very well used cow meadow.  The trail crosses Rt 94 then climbs up to the ridge, eventually passing Greenwood Lake below.
With just one more week before we get back on the trail, we’re taking care of all the last minute loose ends that need attention before leaving for what we hope will be a couple months’ hike.  We’re ready both mentally and physically for a nice long and steady hike, enjoying each day as it comes.",,View Entry,"Apr 10, Tue",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586672,"Today is the last day of waiting and preparing.  All the bills are paid, the mail is forwarded, the cat is with the cat sitter, and house watching and lawn mowing are all arranged.  The backpacks have been packed and repacked several times.  We even have new transitions eye-glasses for the trip.  And luckily for Woofie, when one of her lenses fell out this morning while putting them on, it was at home instead of on the trail.  So, that told us to pack a small precision screw driver, in case we need to repair our glasses again.
We are leaving tomorrow for Damascus, VA.  We have reservations at the Hikers Inn for two nights.  The weather forecast is for a cold and rainy day on Monday, followed by 4-5 days of nice weather.  We’re spending the rainy day in Damascus.  I’m sure we’ll get our share of rain over the two months we plan to hike, so why not start on a nice day.  We’re starting our hike by getting a shuttle north to the Massie Gap parking area in the Grayson Highlands and hiking back to Damascus.  Then we’ll get a shuttle south into TN for a three-day hike back to Damascus again.  After that we’ll return to TN to finish up that state northbound before continuing north on the AT in VA from the Grayson Highlands.  It might sound confusing, but that’s the plan because we’re bouncing our car from town to town, then getting shuttles up or down the trail and walking back to the car.
Today is also the anniversary of my pace maker surgery.  So, now I’ve joined Woofie.  She has two new knees, and I have a battery powered pace maker.  The bionic woman and Iron Man are hitting the trail.  But if you see us on the trail, you can just call us…",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587175,"It was 76 degrees when we left home on Sunday morning with full packs and high hopes.  It was only a 6 ½ hour drive to Damascus.  Along the way we ran into the cold front sweeping across VA, and we had to travel at greatly reduced speed through a heavy and near blinding thunderstorm.  But we made it to Damascus by 5 pm.  The weather had slowed us down a bit, but it had also caused the other people who had booked at the Hikers Inn to cancel their plans.  So we got to stay in a nicer room instead of the one with the twin beds.
The forecast was for another full day of rain so we spent Monday exploring Damascus.  But what hadn’t been in the forecast earlier was that the second half of the day would be snow instead of rain.  We drove up to Grayson Highlands to see what conditions were like up there.  Needless to say, if there are snow flurries down in the town, there are significant snow accumulations in the mountains.  Now we know why White Top Mountain, which we passed on the way, has that name.
By late Monday night the forecast was for sunny weather for the next five days, but three or four of them would have temperatures falling below freezing every night.  We didn’t know if the sun would melt the snow off the trail in the mountains, but we did know that the trail would be wet from all the rain, and would be icy every day.
So we decided to postpone the beginning of the hike for a couple more weeks until the freezing temps are gone.  Woofie was apprehensive enough just walking on autumn leaves on the trail.  Having to deal with icy rocks would have been too much for someone trying not to damage replacement knees.  So, instead of starting our hike on Tuesday, we drove back home to wait for warmer weather. 
We had a very nice stay while in Damascus, finding good places to eat and visiting both of the Outfitters in town.  On Monday afternoon, I met a hiker heading out of town in the snow.  How totally appropriate: his trail name was Santa, and he even had a real white beard and a red Santa hat.  On Tuesday as we were getting ready to leave for home, we saw other hikers heading back to the trail, which made us feel sad and a little guilty.  But Lee, the very nice lady who runs the Hikers Inn, told us not to feel that way.  The other hikers have to hit the trail; they’re walking.  But we don’t have to; we have a car.  So we’re staying safe and will return in warmer weather when we can enjoy ourselves.",,View Entry,"Apr 18, Wed",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587790,"Ok, so now the plan is to drive back to the trail on Saturday and start hiking on Sunday, April 29.  We’ve made our reservations at the hostels along the way and arranged for shuttles up or down the AT, hiking whichever direction takes us back to the car.
Oh, and we're not starting in Damascus this time.  Now we’re starting exactly where we left off on our previous hike.  We’re driving to Mountain Harbour Hostel for Saturday night and shuttling south Sunday morning to Iron Mountain Gap to continue our northward AT trek.  When we get back to the hostel and our car, we’ll drive to Black Bear Resort for the night.  From there we plan to get a shuttle south and hike back, then another shuttle north and hike back again, southbound this time, so we’ll be staying there twice before moving the car up the trail.
I thought that having the car would make hiking easier by simplifying our resupply effort.  But it’s turned out that it requires a lot more planning.  Making reservations and scheduling shuttles means having to figure out where we’re going to be, when, and for how long.  I hope that we can get into a comfortable routine doing this.  But so far I’m longingly recalling our first two years’ hikes, where we just walked in one direction without the need of a schedule or plan.  If hiking with a bounce car were easy, more people would be doing it.  So it must be hard.  But it’s my hike, and I want to at least give it a fair try.
To be honest, though, having the car with us for our last two years’ hikes, which turned out to be very short ones, was a real life saver.  Two years ago we drove our car to Uncle Johnny’s and shuttled north to Iron Mountain Gap.  When Woofie fell and broke her knee cap at the end of the first day, all we needed was a shuttle back to Uncle Johnny’s, so we could return home in our car for the medical care she needed.  Without the car, we would have had to pay not only for a rental car from home to Erwin, but also for another one the next day to get back home.  That would have been well over $1000 in transportation costs for a single day of hiking.  So maybe it really is worth the hassle.",,View Entry,"Apr 23, Mon",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588323,"We made it to Mountain Harbour B&B today, and we’re spending the night in their best room to celebrate the start of this year’s hike. After tonight it will be just the woods, the mountains, and the elements topped off by our cozy tent at the end of each hiking day. 
Tomorrow after a nice warm breakfast we’re getting shuttled to Iron Mountain Gap, about 30 miles south. It should take us four days to hike back. Then we’ll drive to the next planned waypoint, Black Bear Resort, and repeat the process. Tomorrow is forecast to be sunny but cold and windy with temps between 35 and 55. Perfect. 
Looking forward to getting to Roan High Knob Shelter in a couple days, the highest shelter on the AT.",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589130,"After a wonderful AYCE breakfast at the B&B, we met our shuttle driver at 9:15 and were at the trail head at Iron Mountain Gap by 10am. We put on our packs and got started by 10:10 on a sunny but chilly 40-degree morning. 
We warmed up quickly as we climbed out of the gap. It didn’t take long for our bodies to tell us they weren’t used this type of activity. We took it nice and slow with lots of stops. 
Around 1pm we made it to the top of Iron Mountain, so that’s where we broke for lunch. But it was cooler and windier there than it had been lower on the trail, so we didn’t stay long after finishing lunch.
With the hardest part of the day’s hike behind us, we covered the last three miles faster than the first three, arriving at the shelter just before 4pm. We had first pick of the tent sites and got a perfect one. By the end of the day another 6-7 tenters and a couple hammockers arrived. We’re expecting a cold night, but we’re snug and warm in our tent in our down bags. 
Tomorrow we have 8.5 miles to reach Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest shelter on the entire AT.","Iron Mountain Gap

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589132,"When we woke up this morning at 6:00, it was only 40 degrees. We packed up what we could while still in the tent to keep warm, so we didn’t get hiking until 8:10. 
About 10 minutes after we started, we met Vegas, whom we’d met the night before at the shelter, going the wrong way. He had to go back to the shelter to get his hiking poles that he forgot. He said he only uses them as part of his tent, but since he stayed in the shelter he didn’t need to pack up his tent, and so he forgot the poles. 
Around noon we stopped for lunch at Hughes Gap Road. While there a hiker named Po also stopped for lunch. While we were all chatting, it was discovered that his mom and Woofie were both born on the same day of the same year. What a wild coincidence!
But the main event of the day was climbing 2200 feet to reach the top of Roan Mountain at 6200 feet.  It took all we had to get to the top by 6pm. We had planned to stay at the shelter, but we checked the hiker guide book and found that there aren’t any spaces to put a tent there. The shelter is large, but very cold, being the highest on the AT. So we pitched our tent about .4 miles before the shelter.  We know we can keep warm in our tent.  Even though it got up to the high 70s today, it’s just 37 degrees at 9 pm, our hiker midnight.","Clyde Smith Shelter

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589134,"It was so cold last night that we didn’t cook our evening meal, but just ate a Clif Bar and some other snacks. Then we climbed under all our blankets with all the clothes we have with us on, including hats and gloves. We were warm enough but didn’t want to get out of the tent this morning. 
We were packed up and on our way by 8am. It took us half an hour to reach the side trail to Roan High Knob Shelter where we’d planned to stay last night. I had to get water for our day’s hike at the shelter, but the trail was a nightmare to climb, so Woofie waited for me on the trail. 
I climbed the .2 miles to the shelter, then went .2 miles down to the water. With full water bottles, I had to go back up and down the mountain to get to Woofie on the trail. It took an hour to get the water. 
It warmed up quickly to the 60s while we hiked down the other side of Roan Mountain.  From there we hiked over three more mountains: Round Bald, Jane Bald and Grassy Ridge Bald. The views were spectacular. We stopped on Round Bald for an hour and cooked a hot meal. It was so good, and we needed it after missing dinner the night before. While there we met two girl hikers, Jukebox and Girl Scout, before we headed out. 
The trail was all down hill from there to our shelter, but was hard going and we got very tired. We decided to stay at the Stan Murray shelter instead of continuing to the Over Mountain Shelter as we’d planned. We’re glad we did. The other shelter was going to be very crowded and noisy, we’re alone and enjoying the peace and quiet at this one.","Roan Mountain Road
",Stan Murray Shelter,"May 01, Tue",5.60
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589135,"When we left the shelter at 8:30 this morning, it had already warmed up enough to hike in shorts and shirt sleeves. Our plan for the day was to take a short distance day after yesterday’s hike over three mountains wore us out. 
One thing I’ve learned from this year’s hike is that Woofie’s bionic legs are more powerful than my battery powered heart. I know this because when we go up hill, I slow down and she doesn’t. And when we go down hill, she slows down and I don’t.  So she’s better at powering up the hills, and I’m better at coasting down them. 
Half a mile after we started, we passed the side trail to Overmountain Shelter, but decided to hike on because it was a quarter mile off the AT down hill.  So we climbed up Little Hump Mountain. Half way up we stopped for a breather and along came Half-Slow, who is Vietnamese. After chatting with us a few minutes, he was so impressed by our hiking at our age, that he recited a poem by Shakespeare as a gift in our honor. 
Just then another couple he already knew from the trail arrived. They are Marcie and Mary, trail name M&M, who are both from Ireland. We took a group photo to remember the occasion. 
We got to the top of Little Hump Mountain by 12:30. It was so pretty we stayed to eat lunch and even napped in the sun. From there it was only a mile to where we’re camping tonight. On the way we passed through a low forest where the ground was all covered with white.  But it was from flowers instead of snow — so pretty.  And that is where we met Chip, a class of 2015 AT thru-hiker, and his wife, who is trying avoid getting the trail name Dale. They are doing a two-week section hike. 
Our camp site has just a few places for tents, but it’s a very nice spot with the same ground covering of white flowers. The only other hiker staying here tonight is a young girl, trail name Produce, from Quebec hiking alone.  She carries fresh vegetables to eat on the trail.  And tonight she is cowboy camping, sleeping on top of her tent instead of in it, so she can look up at the stars. 
Tomorrow we hike over Hump Mountain and finally reach our car that’s parked at Mountain Harbour Hostel.","Stan Murray Shelter

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589136,"We got an earlier start this morning so we could stop on the trail for water before tackling Hump Mountain, the summit of which was 1.5 miles away and a strenuous climb. The water stop was a nice piped spring next to the trail after walking just .2 miles. 
We continued descending off Little Hump Mountain until we reached Bradley Gap, which is similar to a bald, no trees—just grass, but at the bottom of a valley instead of on top of a mountain. It gave us magnificent views down on both sides and up at the two Hump mountains, behind and in front of us. 
Too soon to have developed our hiker legs yet, we had to stop several times on the way up for a breather—but also to take in the ever improving views and take pictures. 
We finally reached the summit by 9:30. While resting at the top and enjoying the 360-degree panorama, two more hikers arrived, Papa J, a 59 year old from the mid west, and Tumble, a 40-something guy from Devonshire, England. Tumble had a hard time staying on his feet in the bad weather at the beginning of his hike, but he’s currently on a new record of two weeks without a tumble. 
We started down the other side of Hump Mountain around 10am. The first mile was an easy hike down the grassy slope. But the next mile took an hour and a half because of the difficult rock scrambles and trees blown across the trail. We finally reached Doll Flats, half way down the mountain and a nice place to camp or just stop for lunch, by lunch time, and we ate and rested there until 1pm. 
The last three miles down to the road and the hostel where our car waited for us was much easier. We stopped at a spring to get some more water and rest with just a mile to go because it was in the high 80s, and were hot and getting tired. 
When we made it to the road, we were offered a lift to our car almost immediately by Crazy Wolf, a former thru-hiker, himself.  An hour later we’d made it to Black Bear Resort, where we’ll be taking a zero day, and have a much needed shower.  We don’t have our hiker legs yet, but we do have our hiker hunger. We each ate a whole medium pizza, drank two sodas, and then a bowl of ice cream.","Tent site 387.8

There is no cell or Wifi service except for a computer for hikers to use for email, so I had to upload all the photos and journals from our phones at McDonalds in Hampton, where they have Wifi. 
While we got some laundry done in the afternoon, we visited with several other hikers. A couple of them have their dogs with them on the hike. 
For supper we drove to Elizabethton and went to an AYCE Chinese buffet, where we lost count of how many times we refilled our plates. Then we stopped at McDonald’s on the way back to our resort for ice cream sundaes while I uploaded photos. 
It was dark when we finally left there. The drive back up over the mountain gave us the most exciting view of the Hampton city lights. It’s something that most hikers would never see.","Black Bear Resort

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589642,"With the legs and feet feeling better today, Woofie decided she wanted to walk around downtown Elizabethton and visit all the antique stores we saw as we drove through yesterday.  So that’s what we did this morning after breakfast at McDonald’s. Elizabethton is only a five minute drive from Hampton where the McDonald’s is. 
The main street through the historic business center of Elizabethton is lined with several antique stores, so Woofie had plenty to see. Unfortunately, none of the stuff in the stores was antique, just old, outdated, unwanted, or useless.  We also noticed that, although the city was clean and nice, the main street on Saturday morning was empty. No cars and just a handful of people. I guess Elizabethton is suffering the same fate as most towns and cities in that all the real businesses have relocated to the edges of the metropolitan areas where the malls and big box stores are. But we still had a good time talking to the people we met in the stores we visited. 
And that reminds me of the place we visited yesterday. We went to Brown’s Grocery and Hardware store in Hampton yesterday afternoon, and when we pulled into the parking lot, we parked right next to the headstone of Mr & Mrs Brown, located right next to the store. Woofie went into the store and had to ask if they were really buried there in the parking lot next to the store. 
Well, the person she asked turned out to be Sutton Brown, the current owner of the store and the great grandson of the gentleman named on the headstone. He laughed and assured us that no one, as far as he knows, is buried in the parking lot. 
But it really is his great grandparents’ headstone. The reason is that his great grandmother died at age 30, but her husband lived another 35 years. Because of the long time between the times they passed, they couldn’t be buried next to each other in the cemetery. But when his grandfather had the stone made with both of their names on it, he didn’t know they weren’t buried together. So when he did find out, he decided to bring the headstone back to the store. So now it’s in the parking lot for all the store visitors to see and enjoy. 
The rest of the day we spent back at our cottage relaxing and preparing for tomorrow’s return to the trail. We’re getting a shuttle south about 25 mile, back to the trail head on Rt 19E, where Crazy Wolf picked us up three days ago. We expect to take three or four days to get back here to Black Bear Resort.","Black Bear Resort

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589638,"We were shuttled south to the trail head at 19E, where we left off three days ago. When we got out of the car, it started raining, so we had to hurry and put on the pack covers and the rest of our rain gear before we could start hiking. We finally got going by 10:20. 
It rained on and off all day until just after 3:30 in the afternoon, but it was a fine misty type of rain and was quite refreshing to walk in. It did stop long enough around lunch time for us to sit and eat, and it cleared up nicely by 4 pm. 
We met loads of hikers today as they passed us. We made it to the shelter just before 6 pm, but well after most of the other hikers had arrived and picked the most suitable tent sites. Needless to say the spot we finally chose pretty much sucks. Although it looked ok with a nice bed of leaves, it’s not even close to level. We won’t be sleeping late tomorrow.","US 19E Trail head

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589639,"We woke up early this morning, and were hiking by 7:40. It was cool and clear, and we saw the sun come up over the ridges as we walked. About an hour later we stopped to eat breakfast, our morning Clif Bar and whatever other snacks we feel like. By the time we stopped again for lunch at 11.25, we had covered 4.5 miles, so we had been maintaining a 1.5 mph pace all morning. Pretty good for us, considering that we were both still tired from our poor night’s sleep last night. 
As we walked, I began thinking about rocks. We’re surrounded by all kinds, sizes, and shapes of rocks, a wonder to behold. Then I thought, that really rocks!, an expression meaning that’s really good. I hear people say that all the time. This rocks, that rocks, he rocks, she rocks.  Everything is terrific. So here’s a question. When is it bad, when you say something rocks?
Not long after we got going this morning, we met a nice 61 year old lady, trail name Sloth, obviously a reference to her hiking speed. She walked along with us for the next hour chattering away a mile a minute, a much faster talker than walker. She was in the Navy and then the Foreign Service and his lived in many countries around the world. A very interesting lady, who is now hiking the AT. 
Then we met Croft, another lady hiker about that same age. She posts her hiking journals on Trail Journals dot Com just like we do, so we hope to see her journal when we get home. 
Just after we got water at Cascade Falls, we found a nice tent site around 2pm and decided to take advantage of having first pick. We’re happy to make today a short day, both because we didn’t rest well last night and because it might storm later in the afternoon, so we’re ready in our tent for anything. In fact, I just heard thunder as I type. 
So, when is it bad when you say something rocks?  When it’s a rock. As in, “Watch out when you step on that rock!  It rocks.”","Mountaineer Shelter

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589640,"When I put up the tent last night, I also put a tarp over the whole tent to give us more protection from stormy weather. The thunder storm that popped up yesterday afternoon, seeing my rain deterring tarp, gave up and headed some other direction. It never rained on us at all. 
Also tenting with us at our site are Ninja & Josh.  We met them yesterday as they passed us. Ninja hobbled into our tent site with an injured ankle. Since she couldn’t make to the shelter, they set up their tent and sang songs the rest of the evening. 
We got an early start this morning. When we got to Moreland Gap Shelter, we met Choo Choo. She’s the same age as Woofie and is hiking with her nephew and his girlfriend, Josh & Ninja, who we tented next to last night. She began her hike in 2002, but got sick. Four years of health problems later, she was finally diagnosed with Lyme disease. It took her three years to recover. Now she’s back to finish her hike. 
We stopped for lunch and to get water at 12.30.  While we sat eating, Woofie saw a scarlet tanager.  Then within five minutes it got much colder and started to rain. We put the pack covers on the packs, threw on our rain jackets, and started hiking again. So lunch was over just like that. 
As we meandered down the mountain the last three miles to the road, where the hostel and our car are, it got sunny and warm again. We made it to the road by 4:15 and then had to walk the road to our cottage at the hostel another.4 miles. In the 20 minutes it took to get there, it started raining again.

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589682,"Today is a rest day. The two most important things we need to do today is eat as much as possible and walk as little as possible.  It’s nice and sunny, so it didn’t take long to dry out the tent, tarp, and rain jackets. 
Unlike Woofie, I like to snack as I’m hiking. Lots of hikers carry trail mix, a mixture of nuts, dried fruits, and candies like M&Ms. Some trail mixes can be bought in the store, but most hikers like to make their own blend. 
I usually carry a bag of raisins in one pocket and a bag of M&Ms in the other. I never mix them together; I’m a purist. The raisins are a good snack in the morning before we stop for our breakfast meal. After that the M&Ms are fair game for the rest of the day. 
But when I have the misfortune to drop one or more M&Ms on the ground, I always practice the leave no trace code and pick them up and eat them. Mmmm, trail mix.","Black Bear Resort

We made our arrangements to be shuttled north 29 miles to the TN 91 trail head tomorrow morning at 8:30. We expect the hike back to take us five days. Granted, that’s only about 6 miles a day on average.  
But the shorter distance days make for a much more pleasant hiking experience. It gives us time to enjoy very nice places as well as to talk to some very interesting hikers along the way. We’ve also learned that shorter distance days let us get to our intended campsite early enough to pick a good place to tent before they’re all taken.  There are a lot of hikers at this time of the year, and the shelters and surrounding tenting spaces can get quite crowded.","Black Bear Resort

An hour later we arrived at the trail head. We got under way hiking south back to Dennis Cove Road by 9:50. The other hikers departed northward toward Damascus. 
The hiking today was along the ridge on the mountain range. We had no mountains to climb or descend, just a pretty much straight path through the woods with some minor hills up or down. The most tiring thing today was the heat: sunny, clear, no wind, and temps in the mid 80s. 
But walking high along a nice ridge all day does have one big drawback. Without any major changes in altitude, there are few natural sources of water, and the few there are don’t have much water to offer. 
The trail was alive with hikers. We were meeting about 25-30 an hour, all of them heading north. Some we even recognized from the week before on the trail. They’ve hiked to where we are now, but we got driven north past them so we’re now meeting them going the opposite direction. 
We went 7.5 miles today, which is pretty good for us considering our late start. We passed the Iron Mountain Shelter after having lunch there, and hiked three more miles to a tent site near a weak spring, where we’re spending the night.","TN 91

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590305,"Because of the high temperature yesterday and the prognosis of the same today, we got up at 5am this morning and got on the trail by 6:40. We were rewarded with a beautiful view of the town’s street lights below before dawn, a new crescent moon, a glorious sun rise, and wonderful temps in the low 60s to hike in. 
As we hiked along the trail in a cool, clear breeze, we could see the valley below through the forest, whose leaves still haven’t grown enough to obscure the view. And we could see that the valley below was covered with a layer of clouds—overcast for the people down there; undercast for us mountain top dwellers, reveling in the morning sun. 
Hiking along at our usual pace of about 1.5 miles/ hour, we took our first break after two miles. We went two more miles and stopped at the Vanderventner Shelter for another break. By then it had warmed into the mid 70s. The only water source at that shelter is down a side trail and located at an elevation 300 feet lower. It is also a steep down and up, so not many hikers make the trip, nor did we. 
Instead we hiked another 1.6 miles to a spring right on the trail. But by that time the temperature had risen to the mid 80s. We decided to hike back .2 miles to a tent site we had passed and spend the rest of the day and tonight there. 
That puts us just a 7.5 mile hike to our planned stopping point tomorrow, the Boots Off Hostel and Campground. Most of tomorrow’s hike takes us past Watauga Lake, a popular place for the general public to visit. But because of the trash left by all the visitors, the entire area has been declared a no camping area for AT hikers due to aggressive bear activity as a result of the availability of all the trash. That hostel is the only place we can stop to camp for the next 7.5 miles. That’s why we’re waiting here today. It would have been too far to hike there today. Also, we’ll be able to hike it in tomorrow morning’s cooler temperatures.","Tent Site at 441.1

Up early enough to be on the trail by 6:25 this morning, we made it back down the trail to the spring we’d visited yesterday before any of the hikers who’d camped there over night had gotten up. We refilled our water bottles and went on our way. 
We made it down the mountainside to the Watauga Dam by 8:30 before it had even warmed into the 70s. We took lots of pictures as we walked across the dam. We saw the sign commemorating the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that built the dam in the 1940s, creating the man-made Lake Watauga. 
The next two miles to the road where the hostel & campground are posted as a no-stopping area. We weren't even allowed to visit the Watauga Shelter to take a break.  But the trail goes right around the lake, yielding pleasant views. 
To our good fortune a couple from Ohio had driven to the parking lot by the lake to offer trail magic to hikers. Ron, a 2012 thru-hiker trail named Bucket, and his wife Joy were serving chili dogs and soft drinks to hikers that happened by. We got there starving at 11:30, and those chili dogs couldn’t have tasted better. 
After that it was just a short walk across the road to get to the hostel. It’s a great place. With our tent site that has its own picnic table, we also had showers, laundry, and a ride to town for supper. Life is good.","

Although I didn’t know it at the time, I had begun a 44-year span of service in the USAF, which included 22 years active duty as a Russian linguist and 22 years as an AF civil servant providing IT support in the Pentagon. Although now retired, this month I’m a full time AT hiker. 
Today we were awake at 5am and ready to hike by 6:15. But we didn’t get a very good night’s sleep. The people at the hostel never stopped partying until 4am, and we weren’t tenting far enough away to avoid hearing all the goings on. 
Anyway, just as we were about to leave the campground, we met a hiker coming to the campground. He had hiked passed it the day before but stopped and camped in the no-camping restricted zone. He hung his food bag as normal before he went to bed, but bears had gotten his food bag by 11pm. So he had to come back to the campground to replace his food, bag, and ropes. But he should also be given a hefty fine for violating the no-camping area rule. Now the bears have gotten another free meal, and the restrictions will have to stay in place even longer. 
We finally got going by 6.25. It took us til 9.30 to reach the top of Pond Mountain. We rested on top at Pond Flats for a while. Going down the other side was as hard as going up, because the temperature was climbing into the 80s on the way down.
We reached the bottom by 12.30. A stream was there, so we both cooled our feet in the water while we ate lunch. Then we had only a mile to go to get to the shelter. The Laurel Fork Shelter was tough climb and a scary one for Woofie, because it went along a high cliff for a while. 
Tomorrow we get back to Black Bear Resort where our car is. We’re looking forward to clean clothes, town food, and a couple days of rest before going out on the trail again.","

One must have landed briefly on the log next to our tent because it was so loud, it was like having a front row seat at the concert. 
Since we had data service at the shelter, we checked the weather forecast for today and saw there was a chance of thunderstorms in the morning. So we got up early to hike to Dennis Cove Rd before it rained. It didn’t start raining until 4pm, so we made it with hours to spare. 
Along the way the trail ran next to the Laurel Fork River and crossed a very nice foot bridge over it. Before we got to the road, we met Highlander, an interesting and very nice hiker from Washington State, who got his name because he hikes in a kilt. 
We walked from the trail head to Black Bear Resort and got one of the rustic cottages.  After a shower, laundry, and a pizza for lunch, we spent the day relaxing and watching movies. Tomorrow we move the car to Abingdon, Va.  It’s the closest city to Damascus, Va, which will be our hiking destination for the next two legs of our hike.","

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590717,"Having completed both a north and a southbound leg of hiking back to Dennis Cove Road, today we said our final farewell to the Black Bear Resort. In all we’ve spent seven nights there in three different cottages. We enjoyed our time there immensely, and we felt sad to leave our “home away from home” for the last time. 
It was a wonderful place to stay, and we hope to return there again for an actual vacation stay some time in the future. With the exception of a common use computer, there is no access to the internet or cell phone service there. If you’re interested in a peaceful, disconnected vacation place, we highly recommend the Black Bear Resort. The family who own and operate it make every effort to accommodate and please their guests. 
So, today we drove about an hour north to Abingdon, VA.  It was a good day for driving instead of hiking because it rained steadily all day.  We’re staying in the Super8 motel for at least a couple days. One reason, of course, is to rest our tired old bodies.  But the forecast of thunder and lightning storms for the next few days may make it necessary to wait even longer just to be cautious.  We’ll have see how it looks in a couple days. 
When we do return to the trail, we’ll be hiking a north and a southbound section back to Damascus, VA, the so-called “friendliest town for hikers” on the AT.","Black Bear Resort

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591070,"We've spent the last three days avoiding the forecast lightning storms on the AT mountain tops, safe in our Super8 Motel room. But to be fair, here in town we didn’t get many of the storms that we saw nearby on the Doppler radar.  So, we explored the area each day in our car. We found good places to eat and visited antique stores in Abingdon, Bristol, and Chilhowie. 
In one small store in Bristol we learned from the store owner about ramps. He told us that the ramps are now out on White Top Mountain. All we know about ramps is that’s how you enter and exit an interstate highway. 
He said no, they’re plants you can eat. They grow in damp areas at high altitudes. They are wild leeks, something like scallions. They’re supposed to be really good when added to fried potatoes, if you like onions. We never expected to learn about edible vegetables on the AT from an antique store owner, but that’s why we like meeting and talking to folks wherever we go. There’s always something interesting to learn. 
Tomorrow we’re getting a shuttle from our motel in Abingdon to the trail head at TN 91. Last week we hiked from there back south to Dennis Cove Road. This time we’re hiking north to Damascus, VA and saying good-bye to TN. We have to leave our car in Abingdon instead of Damascus because Trail Days is in full swing there.  There would be no place to park our car and no one to shuttle us out of town during the festivities.  But Trail Days will be over when we reach Damascus, so we shouldn’t have a problem getting a shuttle back to Abingdon to get our car.","Abingdon, VA

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591554,"Up by 6am we were all packed, checked out of the motel, and ready to meet our shuttle driver by 9am. He arrived right on cue and by 10am we were hiking north from TN 91. 
The first 1.5 miles were through a farmer’s meadows. The first meadow had a nice gravel path with the grass on both sides mowed. The second meadow we shared with his cows. We had to be careful where we stepped because the cows weren’t careful where they plopped.  With the sun shining on us out in the open field, it got really hot.  But once we hiked back into the shade of the forest, it was 10 degrees cooler. 
We made it to Double Spring Shelter, three miles of hiking, by noon, so we stopped there for a lunch break. Because the next shelter, Abingdon Gap Shelter, was too far away to reach today, we filled all six of our water bottles so we’d have enough water to cook our evening meal wherever we stopped to camp. 
We left our lunch spot by 1pm. Two hours and 3.5 miles later, we arrived at a busy road, Rt 421, where there’s a picnic table and a spring, so we stopped for second lunch and visited with some other hikers.  One was a girl from Australia, and one was a guy who went to West Point and is just finishing 8 years in the army. 
We hiked another couple miles and found a nice tent site along the trail. Our 8.5 miles today is a pretty good day’s hike for us, considering the late start we had. It was a gorgeous day, and the trail was easy hiking.  Tomorrow the weather is supposed to be more unsettled, so we’ll see how it goes.","TN 91

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591555,"The forecast for today was partly cloudy in the morning until 9am when the chance of thunderstorms was to start and then increase as the day progressed.  The Abingdon Gap Shelter was three miles away or about a two hour’s walk for us, so we slept in a little longer this morning, planning to start hiking by 7am. 
We got going by 6:50 and were making good time for just a few minutes, when I heard Woofie go uh-oh behind me. One of her eye glass lenses had fallen out on the trail. She had heard it hit the ground and stopped immediately. We found it right away, but the screw was missing from the frame, so we couldn’t fix it. Luckily, she had a spare pair of glasses in her backpack. That little episode cost us the 10 minutes early start we had, so now we were right on time as planned. 
When we arrived at the shelter at 9am, we found that the forecast had changed. The stormy weather was delayed until noon. We began to hope that, like the day before, the bad weather would either be delayed further or never arrive.  We also became optimistic that we could hike the remaining 10 miles to Damascus for our first ever 13-mile day. 
We left the shelter at 9:30 and covered almost four miles in the next two hours. At the half-way point by only 11.30, we were pretty sure we could make it, even though we could hear thunder in the distance. But we weren’t worried because the radar showed it to be 10-15 miles away to the east and moving away. 
A few minutes later we came upon a tent site, where sat a couple and their dog, whom we’d been leap-frogging with all morning. As we said our hello-agains, we felt a few rain drops, so we started putting on our pack covers. But within a minute of the first rain drops came a heavy downpour. 
Everyone scrambled to put on their rain jackets. The others disappeared down the trail in the rain. We put up a tarp between two trees and made a quick lean-to. There we sat on our packs on the ground under the protection of our temporary shelter for about 45 minutes until it stopped raining. Looking at the radar, it showed that the storm had popped up right over us. That’s why we had no warning. 
But with the forecast for more of the same weather for the rest of the day, we put up our tent and decided that 13 miles wasn’t happening. We climbed into our tent, traded our wet clothes for warm dry ones, and were happy to just camp there for the rest of the day.  
Tomorrow will be a short day with just 6.7 easy, down-hill miles into Damascus. We’ll get a ride back to our car at the motel and a room for the night. We’ll also see about getting Woofie’s glasses repaired at the Walmart eye-glass center in Abingdon.","Tent site at 457.0

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591558,"It had cleared up over night, so we had a nice sunny morning to hike in. As we hiked, we passed several more tent sites along the trail, many of which had also been occupied by hikers over night. We talked to a few of them for a few minutes as they prepared for their day of hiking. One couple, Infinity and Alex, were from England. 
At the next tent site we stopped and talked with Diamond Blue Eyes, a 69 year-old retired army medic from PA, before hiking on.  Just as we arrived at the TN/VA state line, he caught up to us again. To mark the occasion we took a picture of him with his phone and he did the same for us with ours.  It was lucky for all of us that that is where he caught us. 
We covered the remaining 3.5 miles to Damascus, arriving by 11:15. We were starving for lunch, so we walked to the place we knew they had great hamburgers only to find it closed. It seems that they had run out of food over the Trail Days weekend and hadn’t yet restocked. So we walked another block to a diner and got the hamburgers we craved. 
After lunch we went to one of the outfitters in town to request a shuttle back to our motel in Abingdon. We got our ride at 2pm and were in our room before 3pm. We’ll be taking at least one day off because I came down with a cold and need a rest day to recover.","Tent site at 463.3

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591720,"Tomorrow we’re heading back out to the trail. The last two days, beautiful as they could have been for hiking, we’ve spent in our motel room while I tried to get over a cold that hit me fast and hard on the night before we got into Damascus. The easy walk into town had me dragging by lunchtime, and I’ve been feeling lower than low for two days. 
Today finally yielded some improvement, so we drove to Damascus and scheduled our shuttle ride for early tomorrow morning to Massie Gap in the Grayson Highlands. We expect the 31.5 mile hike back south to Damascus to take us four days.
For most of the hikers we meet, that distance would be a two-day hike. And for a couple hikers, Produce for example, it’s only a one-day hike. But a thru hike is like a job to hikers. They wake up, hike, go to sleep, wake up, hike, etc. They have a schedule to maintain to get to their goal at the other end of the trail before Mt Katahdin is closed to hikers in mid-October. 
For us, hiking the AT is our vacation trip.  So why would we want to finish a vacation trip in a day or two when we could enjoy it for as long as we want.   We could take even longer to hike the 31 miles, but that would mean carrying more days’ worth of food, and heavier backpacks. It also means more days without a shower.  So a break at some point, even from a vacation, seems wise for two smelly hikers in one small tent.","Abingdon, VA

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592133,"To prepare for today’s hike, we ordered a large two-topping Dominoes pizza for supper last night. We ate all but two slices, which we saved for breakfast this morning. With Woofie’s glasses repaired, today’s shuttle already scheduled, and the alarm set, we went to bed thinking everything was ready. What could possibly go wrong?
Sound asleep we were when someone opened our motel room door at 1:30am and peeked in. The noise he made woke Woofie up. We then heard a “Sorry!” and the door closing again. I even remember seeing light shining into the room from the hallway as I roused myself to wakeful awareness.  We both asked each other if what we thought we just saw had really happened. I got up, went to the door, and checked that it was secured and that nothing was missing from the room. 
This morning before we checked out, we asked the desk clerk how secure the locks were and mentioned our intrusion. She immediately apologized and confessed it was her fault. She had sent someone to see what a room looked like before they decided to take one, but she either misread the computer or the computer listing wasn’t right, because she thought our room was unoccupied. 
So much for getting a good night’s rest before hiking. Neither of us slept well the rest of the night. 
But from the moment our alarm went off, everything went like clockwork just as planned. We made it to the outfitter in Damascus just as they opened their doors, and were shuttling north to Massie Gap in the Grayson Highlands by 8:15. By 9:15 we were hiking. 
The weather was perfect. The scenery was breathtaking. And the wild ponies were both plentiful and beautiful to watch. Our shuttle driver told us to look for the pony with the long flowing blonde hair. He calls it Fabio. But, unfortunately, we didn’t see Fabio. 
We took our time, walking even slower than usual, and took more pictures in one morning than we have over past four-day hikes.  
Another point of interest was the recent addition of a few bear boxes placed near Thomas Knob Shelter and the tent sites along the trail in both directions. Bears have been stealing food bags and even backpacks recently in that area. The large steal lockable boxes are a place for campers to safely store their food and scented toiletries over night. 
But the bears are smart. They know why the boxes are there and what’s in them.  Bears have reportedly already attacked the bear boxes a couple times, leaving them overturned, but unopened. So just a couple days ago the rangers added another layer of defense. They installed an electrified fense around the bear box. Anyone needing put something in the box or take something out just needs to turn off the juice first and then turn it back on again when finished. 
To me this seems a very expensive and high maintenance solution.  And I also wonder how long it will take the bears to learn how to turn off the power on the electrified fence. But it’s more likely that they’ll learn to watch the box from a distance and wait for someone to open it before charging in for their free meal.  A better solution would be to install bear cables like the ones installed at all of the shelters in the Smokey Mountains. They work fine and need no power to operate. 
We had a great time. And at the end of the day Woofie especially liked seeing flocks of gold finches flitting through the yellow flowers in the last meadow we crossed. But the terrain had been very rocky and difficult. So we only managed to go a little over seven miles and were glad to stop for the day by 5:30.  And a surprise for us, also camping here tonight is Diamond Blue Eyes, whom we met the day we hiked into Damascus. A very good day on the trail.","Massey Gap, Grayson Highlands

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592140,"Today’s hiking took us up one side of White Top Mountain, across the top, and down the other side.  The forecast for today was for an 80% chance of thunderstorms starting at 7am. So we got up early enough to be hiking by 6:40. We got the tent packed away, still dry, and our pack covers and gaiters put on. We were ready for anything. 
We got lucky for awhile and made it to the tent site on top of the mountain by 9am without any rain. We stopped and eat our breakfast meal for a half hour.  By time to move on, the sky had darkened, so we put on our rain jackets.  We refilled our water bottles at the next spring we came to just a short time later before continuing on across the mountain top. 
As we walked, the clouds descended to the ground, and we were walking in thick fog, then light mist, then light drizzle. When we reached the point where the the trail started down and the view of the surrounding valleys were supposed to breathtaking, we could only see a few yards in front of us, just enough to see where the trail went. 
The trail was steep and very rocky. And the lower we went, the harder the rain came. It made for very slow going because of the slippery rocks and roots. 
We met at least a couple dozen hikers climbing up on their way north. And I kept looking along the trail for ramps, the wild leeks we’d learned about a few days earlier. I think I saw one and pointed it out to Woofie, but because of the rain, she didn’t care to stop, and I didn’t feel like picking it either.  So it’s still growing there unmolested. 
We finally came to a tent site where we could stop for lunch by 1:30. It was raining quite hard, and had been for a couple hours. We were wet and tired, so I picked a nice level spot between two trees, hung the tarp to make a shelter from the rain, then put up the tent under it.

But we didn’t really care very much, since Woofie had been battling the cold she got from me for the last two days of hiking. She really just wanted to get back to town and recover in a motel room for a couple days like I had done after our previous time on the trail. Once again she proved she is stronger than I am. I had hiked only one day sick with my cold, but she had just hiked two days over much harder terrain and in the rain with hers. 
We slept an extra hour before starting to break camp and didn’t get hiking until 8:20.  The weather started off nice and the trail was much flatter and easier than the day before. We came to Rt 58, the road we’d been shuttled on to Massie Gap two days earlier, and tried to hitch back to our car in Damascus. Lots of cars and shuttle vans passed by, but none stopped for almost an hour, so we thought we’d hike to the next place the AT crosses the road.  I had no idea what was about to happen. 
A mile past the road we came to the Lost Mountain Shelter, where we stopped to get more water. While there, a couple and their dog arrived. They had also been at our tent site the night before. They told us that just ahead was a junction with the Virginia Creeper Trail, an old rail line that had been converted to a hiker/biker trail. They said they were going to hike back to Damascus on it instead of the AT because it’s so much easier. We decided to do the same. 
We reached the Laurel Creek Bridge after another 1.5 miles. That is where the AT and Virginia Creeper Trail meet. We crossed the bridge and found that the two trails are the same for the next .6 miles. While on the hiker/biker trail, Woofie said she’d like to stay on it until we got to Damascus instead of getting off to go to town today. Although it was now 1pm, because of our late start and the hour we lost waiting at the road for a lift, we’d only gone 3.2 miles and were still 15.5 miles from Damascus. 
But the Creeper trail was so nice and easy to walk on, we could easily go at a 2.5 mph pace. After 2 hours the sky darkened, so we found a campsite along trail to put up our shelter tarp just in time before the rain began to pour.  We sat on our packs, keeping dry under the tarp and eating snacks, for two hours. It finally stopped by 5pm, and I suggested we put up our tent. We were still 9.5 miles from Damascus. But Woofie spotted that the nice tent site where we were sat right under a big dead tree. She said let’s keep going. 
Rested and fed, and with cooler air, we found we could go steadily 3 mph.  Still feeling good after an hour and with only 6.5 miles to go, Damascus began to feel within our reach.
We timed the passage of each mile marker—20 minutes apiece—maintaining 3 mph.  We stopped briefly for a drink and a snack at 7pm, 3.5 to go. Let’s keep going she said. 
For the next two miles, water from all the rain was running across or along the trail. It became impossible to avoid. So we walked in three inches of water, still without slowing down. We reached the Damascus town line by 8pm, but still had almost a mile left to our car. 
We arrived at our car at 8:30, having covered 18.7 miles since leaving our camp in the morning, a distance typical for us of two good day’s hiking and many miles over our best ever distance.

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593127,"We checked out of our motel at 7:30 and arrived at the the Mount Rogers NRA by 8am as it opened for the day. We got our parking permit and parked in the long term lot. 
Rambunny arrived by 8:15. We had her go into the visitor center to correct the phone number that they had given me. The day before when I’d tried to call her cell phone, I got some poor guy who said he’d gotten a few dozen calls for Rambunny in the last couple of weeks since the visitor center had been giving out the wrong number. It turns out that Rambunny doesn’t even have a cell phone, so who knows how they got a cell number to give out for her. But it’s all squared away now, so that guy shouldn’t get any more calls that aren’t his. 
On the ride to Massie Gap, she told us about her 2004 AT hike. That’s when I found out that she’s good friends with Stumpknocker and Mrs Gorp, whose trail journals I’ve read. It was in those journals where I’d heard the name Rambunny before. So I’ve met a real trail journals celebrity. 
She dropped us off by 9am.  We started hiking in a stiff breeze as we crossed the open field. We were glad to get into the trees of the AT. The dark threatening storm clouds of the morning evaporated under the strong sun.  The rest of the day just got nicer and nicer.
We stopped for a lunch break at the Wise Shelter and met several other hikers, some were thru-hikers and some were out for just a week. They all complained about the terrible rainy weather of the last week. Although more rain was forecast for today, it was nice so far, and the next few days are supposed to be nicer. 
We hiked for a couple more hours through some of the most gorgeous scenery. About 2:30 we came to a nice tent site and decided to camp there even though the sun was shining and the sky was clear. Our feet told us they wanted to stop for the day. We set up the tent and climbed in for a rest. About 15 minutes later it starting raining and continued for more than a hour. We were so happy to be warm and dry.","Massie Gap

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593128,"It rained for a couple hours after we made it into our tent yesterday. It stopped for a while, and we managed to cook and eat our evening meal before it rained some more. It rained almost all night. I loved it. The sound of the rain makes me sleep so well. Woofie, not so much. 
We had to wait for the trees to stop dripping down heavily when the wind blew so we could pack up our tent. We finally got going by 7:50 in heavy fog. The trail was very wet, muddy, and slippery, and for the next couple hours between the dark overcast and the thick forest canopy, it stayed very dark and hard to see to hike. 
Along the way a hiker and his dog passed us. We came upon him again later as he was trying to make a phone call from the trail. As we passed, he ranted at us that he’s the unluckiest thru-hiker on the trail. He had some of his things stolen from his pack, his dog is injured, his hiking partner left him because his attitude was too negative, and now he just found out that someone is using his credit card info to buy things online. I’d say he has a right to be unhappy about the way things are going for him. 
We thought he must’ve met some low-life character at Trail Days in Damascus. Later we met him again at a shelter where we stopped for a lunch break. He said the card info is being used in his home town of Milwaukee, and he thinks it’s his father doing it.  What interesting things we learn just hiking along on the trail!
We hiked on for a couple more hours, climbing to the top of Iron Mountain. Yes, now that we’re in VA, they can reuse all the names of things. So this time it’s Iron Mountain in VA instead of TN.  Woofie wanted to take a nice rest at the top. But when we found that we had cell data service, we checked the radar and saw storms heading our way. So we hiked down the mountain after a too short rest to try to reach a tent site a mile away before it started raining.
We made it to the tent site and put up our tarp first in case it rained before we could get the tent set up. Still dry, we got the tent up. Still dry, we repositioned the tarp over the tent so we can get it packed up in the morning if it’s raining then. Still dry, we cooked and ate supper. Now the forecast is for no rain until late tomorrow afternoon. 
Woofie will sleep well tonight. Me, maybe not so much.","Tent site at 507.0

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593130,"Knowing that we had a longer day in front of us, we got up early and were hiking by 6:30. It was nice to have a clear and dry morning to hike in. The trail was gently down hill and smooth for a couple miles, so we made good time, almost two miles in the first hour. 
Around 9am after a long steep climb we were rewarded with a nice water fall. We stopped for a break at Comer Creek Falls and had some snacks. 
While there, Ronrico, from Michigan, and Rattlesnake arrived. Rattlesnake got his name for seeing a lot of rattlesnakes while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. They’d been hiking for days without a shower, so they went for a swim in the cold pool below the waterfall. I hope they made it out of the water again, because they never caught up to us again all day. 
After another long climb we made it to High Point by lunchtime so we broke for lunch. It was nice on top with a cool breeze. Woofie was enjoying herself there until she was surrounded by a flock of millipedes, which she hates. I rounded them up and saved the day for her. 
It was another warm humid day with storms forecast for the afternoon, so we decided to stop early and camp at the Trimpi Shelter. We got here by 2:30 and had to set up the tent as quickly as possible. Not because of rain, but because of swarms of mosquitoes. So we were trapped in our hot tent in mosquito heaven and praying to the thunderstorm to arrive. It was forecast for about 5pm, and it arrived right on schedule. And, being a storm, it was over by 6pm so we could cook supper.  And there were fewer bugs then, too. 
Tomorrow is supposed to be a clear, cool day, just right for doing the last ten miles to get back to the car. We have to reach the Mount Rogers NRA HQ before they lock the parking lot gate at 4:30.","Tent site at 514.4

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593131,"After the cold front blew through last night, the sky cleared, the rain and humidity were gone, and there was a nice cool breeze. This morning it was only 54 degrees, 10 less than yesterday morning. 
With an early start and a cool clear day, we were sure we could cover the 10 miles to the car before the gate closed at 4:30.  And the trail cooperated nicely, too. The path was smooth and gently down hill for the first couple miles.  After a half mile we came to a meadow that the trail passed through for another mile. After the first hour of hiking we’d already gone two miles. 
The thought of getting to the car and going for town food helped propel Woofie along the trail.  We ate our Clif Bar breakfast while still hiking around 8am and didn’t stop for a break until 10:40. After four hours of hiking we’d covered almost seven miles, leaving only three more miles to do with almost six hours still left. We sat for about 30 minutes and finished off almost all of our snacks, first the cheese & crackers, then the chocolate covered donuts. 
Not long after we got going again, Woofie spotted a small bear on the trail in front of her. But It was long gone before I could get a glimpse of it. 
We took the last three miles slower, just because the day was so beautiful with the sunny sky, cool breezes, and flowering bushes along the trail. We made it to the Partnership Shelter, just .2 miles from our car at the Mount Rogers NRA parking lot, by 12:50 pm.  We stopped to talk to Babushka and her hiking partner, Orphan. We’d met them several times in the last two days. They were finishing the same section that we’d just done, but their car was left at Grayson Highlands. They needed a shuttle ride back, so I gave them Rambunny’s phone number. 
We got to the car by 1:15, covering the whole 10 miles in about 6.5 hours. Woofie was already looking forward to getting a shower and a pizza. We got a room at the same motel in Marion, VA we stayed at last time, and were surprised that so many of the hikers we’d seen over the last few days were also staying here. 
With showers taken and pizza eaten, we dried out all the wet gear from our packs. Since one good deed deserves another, we went back out and had chocolate milkshakes.","Trimpi Shelter 523.7

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593293,"As they say, all good things must end. And since we’ve reached the end of the time we planned for this hike, this hike is over, and we’re heading home tomorrow. We had hoped to make it as far as Daleville, VA, in two months of hiking, but when we lost the first two weeks back in April because of snow still in the mountains, it turned out that Marion is as far as we could get in six weeks. 
We always plan on ending sometime in June because the days are getting too hot. But we’ll come back in early fall to carry on where we left off. So today, instead of resupplying and packing for more hiking, we took a drive up to the Big Walker Motel in Bland, VA to see what the next part of the hike will be like. 
When we got there, the first person we saw was Matriarch, a 75-year old lady hiker from Oklahoma we’ve already met in two different sections of the trail. She’s going to complete her thru-hike by jumping up to Mt Katahdin in mid summer and hiking back south until she’s finished. And we’ll be able to follow her on TJ under the trail name Okie.  What a great surprise. 
We’ve had a great time this trip. Some of the sights were even more beautiful and awe inspiring than the ones from our previous hikes. And the best memories are of the many new friends we made along the trail. We hope to see them on the trail again in the future.",,Home,"Jun 07, Thu",0
