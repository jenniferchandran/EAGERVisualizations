Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575119,"And so the trail start took over our life - again!
I am not sure how this happened. In September 2015, lying in the Lakeside hostel in Monson,Maine I promised myself I had finished with the AT. The last few days hiking Maine had been very difficult and we just could not face the 100 mile wilderness. So we went on a three week camping  holiday in Maine and then flew back to Cape Town.
But the AT seems to creep back, slowly, without you realizing it. It calls you, entices you and tempts you to come back and try again. Turning your back, closing your ears or trying to distract yourself with work and other hikes just does not work. 
And so the decision was made. We will do the thru hike in 2018 - leaving on the 4 April - our wedding anniversary. I thought that would be it. Nope - now the real obsession starts.spending hours on trailjournals.com looking at what other hikers are buying, packing and raving about.Now you look at your gear and then look at what is available. Is gear envy a recognized problem.?I know there is nothing wrong with my tent,sleeping bag or backpack BUT the new tents and gear look so good.  So we redo the budget and push the Airbnb a little harder to boost the savings account.  YES YES YES , we can afford the zpack tent,the new sleeping quilts and Osprey backpacks. Lighter is the way to go!
The planning starts, air tickets, shuttles and bounce boxes. The tickets must wait because I can't book the return ticket yet. Luckily we have 10 year Visas, so that's sorted. I just want to get this over and done with and start hiking.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575637,"At which point have you made the full commitment to do a thru hike in 2018
Is it when you have the logo tattooed on your leg or when you spend a small fortune on a new and improved backpack. Or maybe when you start interviewing people to rent your house and look after your animals. Whatever it is, it seems the crazy idea that's was just a thought is becoming a reality. Thru hike on the AT in 2018
Since we have done two long section hikes covering most of the trial, you have a good idea of what you in for. So you have to ignore the voice in your head reminding you of the cold, the heat,bugs,the bears, the ticks, the heights, the snakes and sore body
You have to try and remember why you are attractedto the trial. 
The simplicity of living in the woods, the beauty of nature and the camerardie of shared pain with fellow hikers. And of course the sense of achievement. And seeing what your body is capable of and best of all eating whatever you can lay your hands on whenever you are in town. 
But for now the fun is in the planning. What to eat, what to wear, what to carry, what not to carry, what is a luxury and what's absolutely essential .
And answering the question people ask with a pained expression, but why.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578576,"The gear is coming.
After all the research, after the hours and hours spent on websites, all offering the lightest,best gear, we finally decided on a ZPack tent and two sleeping bags. Between myself and Dandelion (wife) we almost ended up in divorce. There were times of no speaking as we agreed and disagreed on what the Tent and sleeping bags should weigh, look like and work (separate poles vs. Hiking poles, side entrance vs. front entrance and single wall vs. rainfly)
I am sure we will be freinds again sometime soon 
The most exciting part is that they are on the plane as you are reading this, winging its way to Africa, only to return in April. 
I can’t wait to put the tent up in the garden, blow up the sleeping pads and test out the sleeping bags.  I know it sounds childish, but sometimes a little bit of excitement makes us feel younger. Perhaps we will make up once the tent is up",,Home ,"Sep 26, Tue",0
Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579288,"Now the spending begins 
After hours and hours of research, checking websites, watching you tube and following hiker blogs, we have made our choices  
1  ZPack duplex tent 
2 -7 degree sleeping bags from ZPack. 
3 Osprey back pack  
All the other equipment will be from our  hiking cache. Stove and water filter from 2013 Sleeping pads from 2015 and we are good to go.
Is it immature to find an open patch and pitch your tent and spend one night just testing to make sure what you spent your last monies on, was worth it. 
After one night I can say we made the right choices. They will definitely work on th AT

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579522,"Its on 
Yikes! After months of should we or shouldn’t - we have committed ourselves. The AT thru hike 2018 is on 
Plane tickets are booked, House almost rented, upgrading of hiking equipment has begun - so it is on .
Despite declaring after the two long hikes I never wanted to do such a long hike again, we are going to spend 6 months walking in the Appalachian mountains. One of the things I have realized with such a long hike is that mental preparation is as important as physical and equipment preparation. The ability to overcome fatigue,extreme discomfort, bad to scary weather ( lighting and thunderstorms), sore body parts and boredom is essential if you want to summit Kathadin You have to have a strong idea of what you are trying to achieve and tools to get you there. 
Along with the excitement of the adventure comes the constant reminder that this will not be easy going and preparation is the key to dealing with the challenges. 
Mentally we prepare by planning our daily miles, planning our food and knowing that back home we have people supporting and rooting for us and taking care of the domestic issues. 
Physically we keep on doing day hikes. From early next year we will add big backpacks to our routines and so get used to having the weight on our backs 
Equipment wise we have a new Zpack tent, Zpack sleeping bags and two brand New Osprey back packs. Can’t wait to try them out 
Now to arrange the shuttle from Atlanta to Dahlonega

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580069,"Greetings from Cape Town. 
One step closer. Today we registered with the ATC. I know you don’t have to. I know that this does not mean that I have to start on the 4 April and then spend our first night at Devils Kitchen campsite. 
But, by registering, it makes it real. It just reinforces the fact that we are going to do it. It adds to to the excitement building, it brings us one step closer to Springer and those first steps on the AT following the white blaze all the way to Kathadin.  
Now, our conversations are all about drop boxes and where to send them. So as of today, we will send a box to Neil Gap, a box to NOC and a box to Fontana (everything we will need to get through the smokies). After that we will re supply from stores along the trial, except for a major resupply at friends near New York 
Hours have been spent on what to put in the Dropbox. Definitely some dried food, biltong (South African beef jerky), perhaps some medication and lastly treats. 
We have found tennant’s for our house who will look after our dogs and cats (for a reduced rent). All our plans are coming together nicely and the excitement is building. 
Lastly we are talking to a NGO about raising awareness and funds for their cause. I can’t reveal who yet but will let everyone know in the next two weeks. 
Next Wednesday will be listening to a talk by someone who has done sections of the PCT. He will be sharing his experiences and thoughts on ultra light hiking and nutrition on the trail. Looking forward to that. 
That’s all for this weeks update. 
See you up the trail.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580236,"169 days walking in the forest 
169 days on the trail. That is how long we think it will take us to thru
hike. A long time to be walking. 
Question:
how do you eat an elephant?
Answer    - one
bite at a time  
We have
divided up the whole trail in 100-mile sections, trying to guess how long each
section will take us. We also built in rewards to keep us motivated.  Example
we will download a new audio book or a special bounce box with a treat from
home (biltong or dehydrated food). The small things will make this a great
adventure and keep us motivated to put one foot in front of the other. 
I know
how hard it is to accurately estimate the time it will take. The parts of the
trail we think will be quicker, may turn out to be a slow hard slog. Our feet
could be sore, we may get sick, we may meet up with other hikers and slow down
or we may just get of the trail to go sightseeing. So, 169 days is our best
guess, 
In our
planning, to try and create some goals, we have created some “to aim for”
dates.
1 10
days to Franklin so we need to be there by the 14 April 
2 Hot
Springs by early May 
3
Harpers Ferry late June 
4
Hanover middle of August 
5 Monson
early September 
6
Kathadin middle of September 
7 fly
home end of September 
The plan
is not very specific as Dandelion makes it up as we go. Each resupply stop we
will plan for the next section. The next section could be 3 days at 15 miles
per day and then 5 days when we up the mileage to 20 days. In the mountains it
may come down to 12 miles in a day.  Even the best plans will need to be
changed. In between all this is the zero day that we all need to recharge. The
only concrete date is the 4 April 2018, the day we start at Springer. That
is not negotiable  
This
trail is not about physical fitness, but mental strength. The ability to keep
on forcing yourself over the next mountain in the pouring rain. The ability to
keep walking when you tired and hungry. The ability to keep on going when you
wet and cold. 
In the meantime,
we calculate how much money we need to save to walk for 6 months. We continue
to rent out our Beach house on Airbnb and squirrel the income away.
 Slowly we are getting close to our target of $ 4500 For the walk  
 To
Keep fit and motivated we continue to enjoy hiking at home and living the
adventure. Last night we hiked up Stellenbosch mountain to watch the sunset and
the full moon rise. Cape Town is a great place for hiking.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580531,"Hoek to Hoek.
Fifteen of us excitedly set off early on Friday morning to do a little-known hike that goes from Jonkershoek valley, up the panorama route- over the Bergriver neck and into the kloof to Fraanschoek. (about 21 Km) 
 

Lucky for us the wind was blowing as we puffed up to the neck keeping us cool and energised. (with 15 people 14 ladies and one male student this was not a quiet group). We stopped for a snack at the neck, looking down towards stellenboch town on one side and the unknown kloof we were about to climb down into. It looked wild and overgrown with spiky trees and bushes. Putting on our gloves, long sleeve shirts and pants to protect us from the overgrown, prickly plants we started the climb down. Slipping and sliding, grabbing at plants, luckily we had protection.

There is something amazing about standing in a valley looking up at the mountains. They are just so Majestic, so Strong, so Permanent.

At the bottom, a swim and breakfast next to the river in the shade of some beautiful trees.  (time to lick the wounds). The rest of the hike follows the river down the valley. It is very hard to walk next to the river without swimming, stopping for a snack, swimming again and just meandering slowly down the trail while hopping across the smooth creamy river stones. (we almost felt 21 again) 
The plant life in the kloof is magnificent, especially the rare blushing bride (Serruria Florida) that is unique to this area. 
5 pm we saw the shuttle bus waiting at the end of the jeep track running next to the bergriver dam.

Fifteen weary but happy hikers with stories to tell and new friendships made through hiking the Hoek to Hoek together.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580635,"Why?
 Why are we walking 2190 miles from Springer to Katahdin?  This question is not easy to answer. Here are 10 good reasons why. How I answer depends who is asking. Someone close to us will get the more detailed, personal answers. People outside our close circle will get the more generic answers. Our church Family will more easily understand number 4,7 and 8 while our close friends and children will understand number 2 and 10 and fully support us (Springbok and Dandelion) in our quest
Here are my 10 quick answers to the question why we are attempting a thru hike.
 We want to be able say we thru hiked a trail of 3377 km from beginning to end, sleeping in the forest, braving the rain, the wind, the cold and the heat. How great is it to be able to say we did it? Dandelion wants to prove to herself that she can do heights and conquer “The Whites”. She thinks it will be easier if she has been on the trail from Springer. For Dandelion (Leslie) this is a fear that must be faced down.  Because it will be an amazing adventure. The weather, the  snakes, the bears, the bugs, the ticks and of course the people we will meet and the friendships we will make all add up to making this walk worth doing.
Dandelion wants to write a book about the trail and Christianity and the amazing lessons one can learn from living life slowly for 6 months. At the age of 21 I was diagnosed with a heart defect that caused my heart to beat irregularly. The solution was to fit a pacemaker. That was almost 40 years ago. The day I woke up from the operation I was given a long list of things to do and a longer list of things I should not do. I can’t say that I have stuck to those lists. I have run, hiked, swam, driven cars, eaten salt, still drink coffee and many more. That is not to say I have been irresponsible, but I have lived well. Now I want to prove to myself and others that a long-distance trail is not beyond people living with heart disease I will be working while walking to prove that the world is getting so small that I can continue to work, assist customers and manage my business while on the trail. I know you will say that working on the trail is not in the spirit of the Appalachian trail, but I will be combining my interests and passion, and that must be good.  Using our walk as a foundation, could lead to some speaking opportunities that will allow us to inspire more people to get out and enjoy nature and an opportunity to tell others how God is faithful to His children. Perhaps a slight change in my career is in the offing?
I want to spend more of the rest of my life hiking and enjoying the world that God has made. Spending 6 months on the trail seems like a great start. The opportunity to eat what we want, when I want,for 6 months is just too good to miss. Ice cream as often as I can, chocolates to power you up the mountain and giant burgers with all the trimmings. All eaten without guilt. Can’t wait. So, I can be a hero in the eyes of my grandchildren, my nephew and nieces and inspire them to be adventurous, to live life and see the world. To make the most of the opportunities that life brings and to prove to them that you can have an adventure at any age. 
 

I am sure that as we sit here we can add to the list but the overwhelming reason for doing this is a very selfish one. We am doing this because we want to, and we are inspired to. That’s the truth!

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580820,"On the Appalachian trail you are taken at face value and recognised for who you are or who you want to be.  You can become a completely different person with personality traits that you have decided on. You may become more outgoing or you could have decided to become a loner for a period. Because nobody knows you, you are who you want to be. This is an opportunity to leave the past behind you? The ability to start new, the freedom of no one having a preconceived idea of who you are. No one to remind you of the failures or to put you into a box. Relationships are created on the trail based on who you are now and how you present yourself to your fellow hikers.

 I (Springbok) want to listen more, speak less. I want to hear the woods and have time to turn the thoughts around in my mind, before blurting them out. I believe this will be a good thing to learn for the later years in my life. It is time to give others a chance to talk/lead.
 That’s the other reason why trail names are so important. It gives you something to talk about when you meet new people on the trial. A hook to start the conversation and a platform to build friendships. Something that will encourage a longer conversation than just when did you start and how is the hike going
 Your trail name can be given to you by fellow hikers. This is normally around the campfire and is a result of something you said, did or the way you look. Example Rooster got his name because everything he ate was covered in Rooster Hot Sauce, Trash bag because she picked up other people trash and carried it out. If you don’t want others to give you a name, you can decide on a name beforehand and hope that it stays your name. Of course, if you do something stupid or if it an obvious character flaw you may be renamed. A good example of this is “ Wrong way” – a hiker got this name by continually walking South when he meant to be going North.  
 Here are some examples from our last hike; Codger, Trash bag, Fifteen, Poppins, fat man walking, Rooster, Doggy daddy, Trigs, Pantry, marathon man, Fly Bye, little Bird, Sis, Chuck wagon, Easy Rider, Turtle, Slow Going and Bones.
 Why did we choose Springbok and Dandelion?
Dandelion a fluffy flower that floats on the wind. Looks like someone early in the morning who has not flattened down their hair. This is so opposite to Leslie. She wishes she has hair that stands up in the morning. Dandelion is the name that Leslie chose as the sort of look she has always wanted. Out there, fluffy and a little bit wild Springbok: The national sporting emblem of South Africa. The name of the national Rugby team. I am a supporter, some would call me fanatical, but I wanted something that would let me talk about South Africa and Rugby while on the trail.
 So for six months we will lose our identity, live in the moment and will answer to Dandelion and Springbok. Not sure Leslie and Ian will feel the same again.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581079,"I don’t want to die of boredom. – my mental happy places.

Walking for 10 hours a day, every day, for 6 months can become a death by boredom experience. I am not saying that hiking the AT is a boring experience, I am saying that there are stretches of the trail that challenge you mentally. Conversation with those around you dries up quickly and your mind starts telling you:

Your feet hurt (they do but you don’t want to know)
 It is so hot. These flies and bugs are everywhere The mountain is so high
You are thirsty and your water bottle is empty Why are you doing this
Let’s go home !!!!!!!!!!!

 Now is the time to disappear inside my head and look around and decide which happy place/ room to visit to keep myself focussed and motivated. This is the happy place you go to pass the time, to get away from the pain and the boredom. This is the place where you keep your survival strategies and where you go to become strong.
 I need to keep myself from listening to my mind and body if I want to get to Katahdin. There is a saying: “Never quit on a bad day!”. This is true. BUT you must have survival strategies to help you through the day. This is where your happy place comes in. 
What are my happy places that make the time and miles fly by:

1) Christian contemplation
I am a Christian, so I often contemplate the bible reading of the day, or the sermon that we listened to or just the wonders of the world around us and give thanks to My God that I can enjoy Him and his wonderful creation. My favourite of my happy rooms
2) My business
I take my business challenges and turn them around in my head, debate them from all sides and agree a plan of action. Tomorrow I may agree with that plan or may have changed my opinion.  Hopefully by the time I next get to town I can e-mail the staff at home with a well thought through plan of action. Luckily for me there are always challenges when you own your business. My most productive room
3) What an opportunity
 I contemplate new business opportunities and what I may be doing after the trial. Will I start:
The hiking business in South Africa that will generate a great deal of excitement,
 Will I do the summer camps for Christian children,
Will I open the long-distance trail from Pietermaritzburg to Cape Town? A 1600 km walk. 
In this room I can spend may hours.

4) Daily blog
What to write in my daily blog?  I write it in my head all the time. Every step I take I am thinking of what is happening around me, who we spoke to, who passed us and what we saw. Everything is evaluated, questioned and then either filed or discarded. The daily blog is a story written every step of the way.
5) The next few days 
The next zero/resupply point. The dream of a good healthy meaty meal, a warm shower and being clean. What to resupply, where to sleep and how long to stay.  Our plan for the next section of our hike comes together in this room. Dandelion has access to this room too, so often my plans and her plans may not agree. We then have a great discussion which could take up 5 miles to resolve – a welcome distraction.
 At the end of the day, the happy places/rooms are locked for the night, waiting for the challenges of the next day. We fill our stomachs with food and our re energise our minds by hanging at the shelter and enjoyed the company of others. Perfect!!!!

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581161,"Trail magic 2018 

There is a saying that the trail will always provide. The trail looks after you and it expects you to look after it. You need to respect the norms and customs of the trail. So as hikers we practice the LNT (leave no trace policy) wherever we go. 
When we receive trail magic, we always say thank you and never take more than we need. We make sure we leave some behind for the hikers behind us. That is the way it is and that is the way we have always hiked. 
Trail magic has a way of coming at just the right time, to give you exactly what you need. 
An Example

In 2015 my wife and I were doing a long section hike (750 Miles on the AT). It was one of those days, hot and long. We were not talking to one another, we were bickering. “You are walking to slow, you are making a noise, why did you have to say that, I don’t want to stop now, why are you always trying to control everything.”  You get the picture. As we were coming down a long hill, two day- hikers came up and asked us if we wanted some salami sticks and a cold soda. Of course we said yes. Once the hikers had left, we finished the food and drink and carried on walking, talking about the trail magic and how the trail always provides. Trail magic saved the day  – we were friends again.

Trail magic 2018:  starts early: 

A hiker we had met in 2015 saw that we were going to Thru hike in 2018 and offered to fetch us from the airport, give us accommodation in Atlanta for two nights to help us get orientated, will drive us around to purchase what we need and will then take us to Dalonehga the day before we stat hiking. She is a trail angel.  Thank you, CAT.

A big Thank You

This left me thinking about all the amazing volunteers and trail angels out there. Even before we start this walk let me say thank you. Some of you we will meet on the trail and thank you in person. If we don’t meet you, please know that we do appreciate the kindness you show to us hikers.  We thank you for clearing the trail, making sure the blazes are visible and checking out the shelters to make sure they are usable by us, as we make our way along the trail.

To the trail angels of 2018. A thank you for all the effort, time and money you spend to give us hikers a fantastic opportunity to complete the thru hike. Every bit helps. You have no idea of the impact you have. You may even save a marriage?

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581845,"Go baviaans  the 4 day 3 night trial in the Baviaanskloof.
To start here are some intresting facts.
1 The babiaanskloof is a world heritage site 
2 Baviaans means baboons in Dutch  - we saw them 
3 The name of the trail is the leopard trail 
4 It is a 50km drive on dirt road through the Nuwekloof pass to get to the start. 
We  decided to arrive the night before so that we could walk to the cedar waterfall for breakfast before starting the on day 1 of the hike..
The drive in along the gravel road was doable in the Hyundai if you drove slowly and made sure that you kept a lookout for larger rocks in the middle of the road. Hitting these rocks are not good for the car or for the relationship of the driver and passenger ( Wife). The  50 km drive took about 1 hour 20 minutes and the car, a little dusty, handled the road well. 
On the drive in we saw two klipspringer buck, a tortoise and some baboons. Can’t wait to see that leopard. The natural beauty is amazing and the folded Cape rock mountains tower over you. 
We had booked two beds in the hiker house, part of the cedar falls guest farm, but because it was Christmas Day we had the whole house to ourselves. We settled in and spent the afternoon reading and taking a short walk to stretch our legs.  The rest of the hiking group will arrive in the morning 
Supper was just a sandwich and coffee followed by left over trifle from Christmas Eve diner with friends. 
Early to bed to get ready for day 1 
On the hike we will be testing:
1 My arm coolers I  got for my birthday - worked very well, no sunburn 
2 The blue tooth splitter that will allow myself and Dandelion to listen to audiobooks - brilliant we could walk and listen , a winner
3 Our new pillows and pillowcases. - fantastic 
4 Rooibos tea as an additive to my drinking water. - Mmmm still thinking about this one 
5 First outing for my new black diamond tracking poles.- Yep great choice. 
Sadly our mountain hardware down jackets are still held up in customs so they will only arrive middle of January (middle of summer) we will have to just trust that the gear reviews are accurate and test them in Georgia when we start, 
Day 1 base camp to camp 1 
This was a slack pack hike. So we packed all our gear into the black crates provided, filled our water bottles and marched out of camp. Julian and the rest of the hikers would arrive later, so we decided to hike to camp,1and meet them there.  
Leaving base camp, you turn right and immediately climb 300 meters to the first shelf and then another 150 meters to the top. A long walk across a boulder field in the mid day sun was a challenge. In the distance we saw a herd of blesbok who ran as we walked by.  We detoured to Gabriel’s   pool for lunch. Home made sandwiches with coffee. Why does everything taste better on  a hike. 
Lunch over we walked on. 4 horses walked up to us, sniffed, relished we had nothing for them and wandered back up the rocky valley. We turned down the valley and after an hour found the camping site. 
All our gear had arrived, including Granny, who at 83 was a bit old for the walk, so was transported along with all our gear from camp to camp. 
Half an hour later the others arrived and tents were set up, fire started and food made. 
Early to bed, tomorrow was going to be an early start 
Day 2 camp 1 to camp 2 
The wind. There is nothing like trying to put up your tent in the wind. The gusts broke a tent pole and whipped up the dust and the sand as we set up camp. I hate the wind. and after we had walked for 17 km 
Earlier,we broke camp early and by 7 am we were walking.  It was supposed to get very hot so our first stop was going to be reflection pools. Reflection pools turned out to be suffering from  a lack of water. Luckily we had packed enough water for the day. 
The group decided to stay and rest. All the sleeping mats came out and we all had a great afternoon naps. Getting bored we listened to a audible book where is the next shelter. This gave everyone a taste of the Appalachian Trail. It certainly passed the time.  
By 1  PM we were ready to walk. The route description made a point if mentioning a swimming pool at camp 2. The motivation for getting going was the pool. 
It was hot. The heat bouncing of the rocks made it a long 2 hours as we walked down the valley. 
The shortcut was signposted. No discussion. We all took the shortcut.  No argument 
We walked to the swimming pool. It was dry. Not a drop. Not even a pipe running into the pool. Off we trudged to camp 2. 
Surprise. There is an awesome shower. The day ended well. Clean and  a full stomach 
Day 3 camp 2 to camp 3 
Today promised 3 big climbs and then a 9 km walk down a wooded,shaded valley full of indeginius trees and plants. 
By 6.30 am we were packed up ready to go. The first climb  - honey bush  hill comes after 5 km off steady walking down the valley. Slowly we start climbing and straight up the mountain to the neck. Your are amazed at the view of rolling mountains. As far as you can see the mountains roll on.  Looking closely we can see the trail down from where we are standing into the valley and up the other side to climb the next mountain - inconvenient truth. 
This was straight up the side of the mountain untill you reached another beautiful view. 
2 out of 3 done. Then down into the valley and up aint so bad. It wasnt. 
Draaipunt marks the halfway point with a short walk to a stream and a great place for lunch. As we arrived we were greeted by two black eagles soaring across the valley. 
They are magnificent. 
With 9 km to go it was not a long lunch and after a quick 30 winks and another chapter of the book,  we were on our way. 
The valley has been devasted by fire and a flash flood that  happened a week ago. 
Trees are burned and the trail is washed away. This must have been a beautiful place, with tall trees along the winding stream. Now, just a jumble of branches left behind by the flood. 
3 hours later we walked into camp and there was a swimming pool. Packs down and everybody in, clothes and all
Tents arebup and the fire is roaring. Supper tonight will be ribs. 
Did i mention we saw leopard spoor today. Looked like a mother and her young one. Excitement. 
It has been a great walk but time to go home.  
Day 4 camp 3 back to base camp. 
7 am and we packed and ready to go. We smelled home and hot showers.
The walk started through birdsong valley, unfortunately, the fire and  flood had devastated the area and the birds were very quite. The marking of the trail was a challenge and the map was consulted frequently. Into the river bed then up the bank, around the fallen tree, through the sand patch and then back up the river. Occasionally spotting the leopard trail marking, high fives because we we still on the trail 
To leave a valley, you need to climb out, and climb out we did. A steep 500 meter climb up a mountain right to the very top. 
Half way up we had to step over a garter snake who did not mind that humans were  stepping over it. 
A quick walk across the plateau and then into the cauldron. Two valleys with a 300 meter climb separating  them. It was getting hot and we all wanted to get home. 
Cresting the last ridge and down the last long hill to base camp. 
The shower to rinse off the dirt was amazing. Hot and powerful. 
Clean we packed the car, and started the long  drive home. 
A great hike. I will definitely be back in a few years when the area has regenerated.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582026,"I am becoming paranoid.
I am a mature, sane man, who thinks rationally. I have my own business and can control my emotions. Even if I say so myself, I am not prone to Paranoia. BUT…..

I woke up this morning with a headache. Not a severe headache, just a small thumping in the back of my head. Not a big deal, except…… my first thought was I hope it is not something serious that will keep me from staring to hike on the 4 April. 
This is happening more and more. I drive more carefully, I walk down stairs slowly, when I hike, I make sure I put my feet down in the proper place. I stay away from people who are coughing and sneezing. I am starting to change the way I live.

Every ache and pain is examined. Is it serious, do I need to get medical attention. Do I have to rush out and buy medication or a splint or brace? The worst is that every ache and pain can be linked to (in my mind) to the gear I am using.

My knees are a bit sore – do I need new shoes
My back hurts – do I need a new back pack/sleeping pad
My stomach feels a bit uneasy – do I need to change my diet
I am to hot – change my gear
I am to cold – time to buy new gear 
I try to sit down, take deep breaths, push these ideas to the back of my mind, and constantly tell myself that I am being silly. These thoughts don’t go away. 
I need to develop coping mechanisms to deal with my paranoia, if I don’t, I am sure that I will be spending the next 6 weeks locked up away from the world or relying on medication or alcohol to keep me calm (I am partial to a good red wine).I  don’t want to arrive in Atlanta, bubble wrapped, protected from the world. Come on April 4,  hurry up,  I am not sure I will make it to then

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582233,"The sweet spot.
Golfers talk about it, baseball players talk about it, cricket players talk about it. Rowers will tell you they are in the swing. Athletes may say in the zone. That spot that is just right. Perfect.
The dream that has been chased and now achieved. Long hours of training, thinking, crying, tinkering and coaching. Searching for perfection. Always looking.
Everyone has a story of the perfect shot. The perfect moment when it all  comes together. That moment that brings a big smile to your face and a feeling of contentment . 
The morning was a typical South African summer morning. The Idea was to walk over Stellenbosch mountain with 25 pounds on our back. Snacks were packed, water bottles filled and With a sense of “let’s see if we can make an improvement to how the packs are carrying” we set off up the mountain 
After two weeks of adjusting this strap. Pulling down that strap, shall I carry the pack high up on my back or do I carry it low. You all know the frustration of the pack just not sitting right. The straps that bite into your shoulder, the pain in you back or the numbness of your bum as the pack presses on a nerve. It seemed that no matter how hard we tried it was just not right 
This morning it all came together. At last that final adjustment of pulling the bottom straps up, allowing the weight to ride slightly higher on my back and suddenly me and my backpack were one. 
It is so hard to explain this feeling of comfort. You know that you have 25 pounds on your back. You can feel the weight but somehow it is not heavy. You can feel the straps and yet they feel normal, aah my pack has found its sweet spot, it’s in the swing. I am in the zone.
Now I want to wear my pack, I want to pick up my pack and go walking. We have bonded. My pack and I become one this morning.  A marriage made for the trial.   I am in love.  Now to fall in love with my hiking sticks.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582525,"Objective 1 Franklin by  14 April.
 Start with the end in mind. In the context of the Appalachian trail, this means that we all start with summiting Kathadin in mind. This is what has inspired us to start.  A good planning strategy that, in my case, may lead to failure because I am forgetting that to get to the end I have to start at Springer. To get to Springer I have to do a whole lot of things now. If I don’t do the Now things, then my chances of summitting are greatly reduced.
 All sport stars play to win and dream of winning the league, yet when asked, everyone says that the next game is the most important and they will be focusing on planning to win just that game. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, they say. One game at a time. Short term focus.
 My challenge is this. While I dream of Kathadin, my shakedown hikes are forcing me to get some short term focus.  So for the next two and a bit months, I am going to focus and on getting to Franklin by the 11 April 2018. That has now become my all-consuming goal. If I can make the 110 miles in 10 days of hiking, then I am set for the rest of the trail. Once there, I will take a zero and use the time to plan the next 100 miles/ 10 days. If this works, copy and repeat.
 I need to do this 22 more times and I will get to Kathadin. Sounds doable to me. So.....

 This means:
 Focus on my training. Now is the time to get up in the morning and with energy and discipline, put on my back pack and get out and start training. I need to get this first block on the checklist done. If I don’t get this building block in place now, how can I ever dream of summating Kathadin? Checking out my feet. I have to go to the podiatrist to get my feet checked out. They have been complaining lately so I have decided that they need to be examined. If I am going to walk to Franklin and then 2200 miles to Kathadin then I think I should spend some time loving my feet. Without these feet this may be a short walk.
Checking out my gear. If they work for my shakedown hike and the first 10 days, then they should be good to go. I will replace whatever I need to on the trail. The drop boxes will go to Neil’s gap (day 3), and then 7 days walking to Franklin. After Franklin and our first zero we can talk about where next to send the box if we want to. Franklin will be our first real resupply point. If we can stay out for 6 nights without coming into town, then going to Kathadin starts to become a reality Training my mind to be in control. Using the time now and the first 10 days to get the right mindset, to build the mental discipline to push just a little more. To practice saying no to the legs and forcing yourself to go the top of the mountain. Now is the time to discipline the mind and show your aching feet and legs that you are in control. You make the decisions around here and they better get used to it. 
So now when people ask me am I planning a thru hike I say that is what I am dreaming about, but I am only planning for the first 10 days. If I do that right, then the rest should take care of itself. One section at a time

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582882,"Waiting  is so hard   - leave some trail for us please
 Lying in bed on Sunday morning, scrolling through my Facebook feed it is full of hikers starting today, starting tomorrow or next week. Everyone is joining the party and is getting out there to start the greatest adventure of our lives. I am stuck in sunny Stellenbosch with over a month and a half to go before we fly to Atlanta.
 Let me describe my state of mind:
1 Yesterday our training walk sucked. My legs were tired and the 3 mile climb was just plain hard. My legs and I had to have a serious conversation about who is in charge of this body. I know it will all be ok on the day but yesterday a small seed of doubt crept in. You can’t even walk up this mountain, what are you going to do on Sassafras and Blood Mountain. The people on the trail are telling you how big these climbs are. 
2 My backpack that was my friend for the last two months became evil yesterday. A true Jeckle and Hyde. I could not get this pack to be comfortable. After all the miles together, it seems my pack is also eager to get going and is bored now with these little walks. It seems to be saying “When is the real thing coming? When are we getting our chance to go and play in the woods?” 
3 When I was a child, sitting quietly and waiting was not my strongest trait. Nothing much has changed. Everyone ahead of us is already having their adventure, making their stories (and blogging them) and here we sit, in the starting pen, impatiently checking our gear, checking all the lists and just waiting for our date to roll around.
 Let’s be honest, all of that are  us still waiting , we can’t get enough of the news from those on the trail, but can’t help feeling a great deal of envy that we not there yet. Please leave some of the trail for us, we are just behind you.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583127,"We are boring ourselves already. I can’t imagine how our friends and family are feeling. The world revolves around the trail. My Facebook feed is just AT hikers leaving, packing, packing to leave, waiting to leave. But for us, we are in the training/planning phase. 
I have always been told that in order to succeed, one must do a few 
1. Have a goal - Kathadin2. Have a plan - walk for six months 3. Break the plan into achievable milestones - first stop Neels gap 4. Have the right equipment - we have everything we need 5. Practice, practice, practice!
Steps 1 - 4 are pretty much sorted, it is step 5 that is still in progress.
So what are you doing, you ask. Great question because the answer has four components: 
1 Physical training. consists of hiking three times a week with our backpacks loaded with 25 pounds of water. One hike is a long 4 hour hike up a high mountain. In the coming weeks we will do two full day hikes with our back packs just to check that the legs are good. In addition, we do three spinning classes a week, normally 45minutes but on Wednesday we add another one hour class to get the endurance up.
2 Mental training. consists of hours and hours of watching thru hike videos, living every second of the 2017 bloggers and what they faced. Preparing ourselves to face the same challenges, endless talking, planning of routes and food and routines. We are boring ourselves already, I can’t imagine how my friends and family feel when they hear us talk. Man,we must be super boring. Only hikers can discuss pack weight for two hours!
3 Managing what is left behind. Our house is rented, we sell the cars in two weeks’ time and our animals have a great home until we get back. The business is in good hands. We are starting to disengage with church and family and planning the farewell dinner with children and grandchildren. 
4 Making sure we spend the money we have on being able to last the whole trail, but also to pay the bills back home while we walk. This is not that stressful, just takes some careful planning and not focusing too hard on bank balances. 
It is only when you start finalizing the plan, sorting out the practice or final training stage, that the hike becomes real and the first hurdle to cross is that little voice in the head that says is all this disruption really worth it. The loud voice in my head says hell yes yes yes!!

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585024,"I thought that with one week to go we would have it all wrapped up. The planning that was done in September last year showed that this last week would be spent resting and double checking that we had it all sorted out. 

This has not happened. There is still so much to do before we fly out from Cape Town this Saturday. 
The shopping list just seems to get longer. Coffee satchels, compression socks, bounce box treats that will remind us of home. Then there are the birthday presents and Luther memorable gifts that have to be bought and left behind to be given to the right person at the right time 
The saying goodbye to friends and family. Meeting all those that are important to us and trying to touch base that with those that can’t make it. We are busy every night this week saying goodbye and sharing our story.
Getting all the things in place to manage my business. One final management meeting and a quick meeting with those responsible for the Marketing. Briefing my fellow directors and handing over the projects I have been working on 
Packing up our gear and making sure that we pack what we need and leave behind the stuff not required. Each piece has it place and needs to be checked and serviced. (Dandelion bought a new sleeping pad, but it leaks and needs to be returned) 
All the insurances and finances need to be checked and understood. Power of attorneys need to be signed and finalized. Need to make sure that the credit card companies are aware that we will be in the USA. 
Final checking off of the main list and all the sub lists. Pack back list, bounce box list, audible book list, things to do in Atlanta list, shopping at REI list, the lists go on and on.
Planning the first 10 days, making sure that we will be in Franklin by 15 April. Food, drop boxes and walking miles all agree. The rest of the trail will take care of itself
Training,training and more training. Putting on our back packs and walking everyday for at least 3 hours. Checking our equipment, adjusting, tweeking and getting the settings just right.
Checking all the settings and links on the Facebook and you tube sites. Making sure the our procedures and process are good and that our posts will all be up on the sites for all our followers to read or watch. 
Last interviews (Cape Talk on Thursday at 2.30) and a final push to raise awareness and funds for the heart and stroke foundation of South Africa. Please support this worthwhile NGO by donating to foundation. All funds go directly to them and will not be used to support our walk. 

This week is going to be a short week and before you know it we will be in the trail and the grand adventure will have begun. Leaving Cape Town on the 30 March and starting our hike on the 4 April. 

Thank you for supporting the foundation. keep on sending messages of support they keep us motivated to keep on walking.

We had flown for longer than 24 hours and waited at Doha airport for 8 hours. To say we were tired is to underestimate how we felt. We were knackered. 
Before we could rest we had to be nice to customs and immigration at the Atlanta Airport. “Please can we stay for 6 months”. We were so nice he let us stay until the 31 December. If we are still walking then, heaven help us. 

Waiting for us at the airport was a trail angel, kathy who fetched us from the airport, took us home, and gave us a place to sleep and fed us for two nights. 

Then last night we went out to supper with Michelle (Well woman) a hiker we met in 2015 and kathy and her husband. Pizza in the USA is really good. 

This morning we did all the boxes of treats we need for the next 20 days. 1 box to Neils gap (around mile 30) to be fetched on Friday and one to Fontana dam (around mile 164). 

We will go into a couple of towns in between to buy some food. 
Everything is ready. 

Kathy then drove us down from Atlanta to Dahlonega (about 100 miles)

Miles for the day 14.2

Weather cool but sunny 
 

It is like meeting an old friend. 
 

The moment we got to the top of Springer Mountain and saw the first blaze, the plaque and the write our names in the book that is kept in the cubbyhole in the rock, we knew we had made the right decision. It was great to be back in the trail. Then as if to say welcome the mist cleared and we had spectacular views of the mountains around us. 

We started the day with breakfast at Macdonalds (yes we know that it is not the healthiest but that was the best on offer). While waiting for the shuttle we met a hiker who had started two days ago. Full of knowledge he told us all about how difficult Sassafras mountain was and how he nearly died climbing the mountain. We said nothing and just nodded. On the ride up to the Springer parking lot, it was decided that we would have a code word for hikers that know it all. - Bobbejaan. We will use that word when we think someone should be ignored. 

2 interesting facts: 
1 it was our 37th wedding anniversary today and we got married at 15.30 ish on that day.'
We left Springer at 9.45 ish and if you convert to South African time, then its close. I am not sure exactly what time we actually said ""I DO"" 
2 The army are doing exercises in the woods and so we walk past soldiers camouflaged as trees. We can see them but they don't make eye contact. This is a serious exercise. 

The walk today to lunch at Hawk Mountain shelter was greet. A little chilly but no rain and quite a few people to chat with. 

The afternoon walk up Sassafras was a bit more challenging and for the first day out perhaps a bit ambitious. It kicked our butts and even though we are reasonably fit it felt very difficult. 
We planned to stop at Justice Creek. Got here around 4.30, set up camp and we are now snug in our new sleeping bags and tent. 
Tonight will be a great test as the temperatures are going to go to freezing. Will let you know in the morning how it went.

Weather: warm and sunny 

We thought we were organized and could pack up efficiently. This morning was chaos. It was cold and we were falling around, looking for stuff, putting things in the wrong bags. Generally not a good way to start the morning. 
We finally left camp around 8.45 still talking to one another and as it normally is, the trail goes up. A nice way to warm up and get the muscles working. 

Last night was cold, but we survived without too much fuss. Our sleeping bags, sleeping mats and silk liners kept us warm. We did have our down jackets on plus long pants. 

We got to Gooch Gap shelter and went in for a pack break and a privy stop. Everyone was keen to tell us that there was another South African on the trail and we had just missed him. So we set off to find our South African compatriot. Half an hour later we caught him (Firebreather) is his trail name because he can purse his lips and blow powerfully into the fire causing it to flare up. We stopped for a quick chat and agreed we would meet up the trail. Dandelion was in a hurry today because there are only 5 tent sites at Lance Creek. We agreed we will talk tonight. I am sure that if we are both going to Maine, we will meet again. 
The big news of the day was the trail magic at Woody Gap. 12 Tribes Hostel had set up a gazebo with tea, soup, fruit and of course brownies. We stopped and visited a while with fellow through hiker wannabes. It is still too early to contemplate that you will walk the full 2200 miles. For Dandelion and I, we will keep on talking about hiking to Franklin. After that we can plan the next 10 days. 
We arrived at Lance Creek around 2.30, found a great spot and we are now resting in preparation of Blood Mountain in the morning. 
So far no animal sightings except chipmunks and squirrels and we heard a woodpecker. 

Please remember to visit the heart and stroke foundation and donate to their great cause of educating people around heart disease and strokes

We packed up quickly and efficiently. Yes, we are getting it together. 8 am and we were out of there. The first iconic mountain to climb and Neil’s gap for lunch. It was shaping up to be a great day. 

As we walked towards Blood Mountain there was a choice of two mountains. I choose the right and Dandelion chose the left. The crow or cry game. Dandelion lost and I crowed and crowed all the way to the top. 
The view from the top was great. 
On to the next milestone. Neil’s gap. This is the watershed. The place where 30% of hikers give up. There is a tree that is full of boots, old and new where people who have given up leave their boots or where people who have bought new boots, leave their boots. They also sell new gear and food. Three sandwiches later, both myself and Dandelion were full and ready to go. 
Then into Pudland. Georgia is known for puds. Pointless up and downs. The trail planners look for every mountain and then take the trail right up every mountain top. The views are great but it would be great to walk around the mountain for a change. 
Then trail magic number two. 
At the gap there was trail magic of chips and soda. The people doing the trail magic's daughter lives in Stellenbosch and is married to Songeso Faphza. They do awesome work among the children. 
It was supposed to rain tonight so we walked off the trail down a side trail 1.2 miles to a shelter. 
Out of the rain. 
Slowly we are growing. Our trail family is growing and we are having good conversations and great discussions about the trail. 
Health wise we are still good. Mind-wise we are still strong. 
Still feeling excited about being here.

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586184,"I hate day 4. On day 4 your lack of sleep, lack of shower, lack of clean clothes and lack of privacy reach tipping point. It is now when we both have to be mature and suck it up. So far we managed to stay civil. 

Yesterday we decided to do the 1.2 mile down to the shelter. This morning started with the 1,2 mike up to the trail. A great way to warm up except we had forgotten that we were in the land of puds (pointless up and downs) and that is what we did for 12 miles. I am sure that there was more up than down. It just felt that way. 
We are at that stage of the trail where we see lots of people. Some new, but mostly people we have seen before. Tonight at the shelter there are at least 6 people we have known. I won't introduce you yet because a lot of them have sore knees, and other twinges. This is what happens when you walk a long distance trail. 
A storm is rolling in and tonight we are going to get to -5 degrees. Should be fun to check our gear again. A lot if the hikers have gone into town to spend the night. We want to save our dollars for later. 

Food wise, i am getting used to peanut butter in almost anything. Mash and flavoring for supper , bread and peanut butter for breakfast/lunch and then snacks (snickers or energy bars in between).

Springbok and Dandelion,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586186,"A day to remember. 
First was the cold last night and then trail magic supreme. 

It was cold last night. Ice in the tent, ice on the food bags and ice on the trees. On the one hand the cold makes everything more difficult. Clips don’t open, you have to take your gloves off to do anything, then out them on before your fingers froze. So it was frustrating packing up. Eventually we got going and walked straight into a winter wonderland. The trees were all iced up and ice dangled from the branches. As far as we could see were ice sculptures. It made the walk down to the gap (Road) pleasant. 

On the way down we are stopped and asked if we were Springbok and Dandelion. Yes we replied hesitantly , not sure of what was coming next. Tatter then asks if we would like spend the night with him and his wife at their cabin in the woods. We have a shower, and I can pick you up at the gap and take you home. We can't describe how grateful you are when you stink, your clothes stink and it is freezing outside and a trail angel invited you home. Then takes you to all you can eat supper. Southern fried chicken, mash and gravy and salads and vegetables. We did make the most of that diner. Then a store where you can resupply. Thank you. 

Then at the bottom, a group of previous thru hikers were feeding current hikers breakfast. So we stopped and had beacon and sausage buns for breakfast and a great cup of coffee. 
Then we had to climb rocky mountain on a full stomach. Rocky Mountain is a 650 foot climb in about a mile. It certainly warmed us up. 

On the way down someone had put cans of beer every 10 yards down the mountain. Dandelion and I shared a beer on the way down. 

Down at the gap was a whole case of colddrinks, so we had some to drink. 

Then up Tray Mountain 1316 feet in 5 miles. This is the climb of the day. Slow and steady and up we go, only to have ice rain down on us at the top of Tray Mountain. It sure seems strange to see icicles rain down all around us. 
Tatter was waiting for us just short of the gap and we were taken home and spoiled rotten. 

Oh yes we did hike up and down some mountains today.

We were so busy talking we walked straight past the sign without even stopping for a picture. We were not going to go back half a mile just for the picture. 
We are getting into a great routine. Up around 7 am when the sun rises and out of camp by 8. Dandelion prepares our breakfast the night before so we stop around 10 am for breakfast. 
Then lunch around 1. Before lunch we talk or walk in silence. After lunch we have started to listen to audio books to pass the time.We aim to finish walking around 4.30/5.

Tent goes up first, then I fetch water, while Dandelion sorts out her sleeping pad and bag. I filter the water and fill water bottles and a 2 liter bladder we use for coffee and supper. I make the coffee and supper and then it's clean up , bear bag hanging and by 8.30 we are asleep. 
Today we were glad to leave Georgia and we were welcomed by North Carolina with three steep long climbs. All this before lunch. Not nice N/C. 
After lunch we climbed our first 5000 foot mountain. Standing Indian Mountain. Here there were great switchbacks and it made for an easy afternoon walking. Then down to the gap. 
Pitch our tent and another day is done. We are walking faster and further than most people at this stage, which means each night we meet new people. Only two people from last night shelter has kept up with us. 
Gump is an engineer from India and has 4 months to walk the trail. We sort of leapfrog each other on the trail. 
Evan is a graduate who has traveled the world and is now doing the AT before starting work. 
 We have so much to be grateful for. 
1st state done. 
We are getting our trail legs.

Both of us are still healthy. 
We are still talking to each other.

We survived the coldest night in Georgia in 25 years in our tent.

We are a little homesick and feel far away especially if we are needed by friends or family.

Week 2 and all is well. We are getting this walking thing down to a routine. 
So today we hit three milestones. 
1: We walked passed the 100 mile mark today. Not far in the context of the walk but at least 50% of people quit the trail by this point. So we feel that passing this landmark is a great start. 
2: We climbed up Albert mountain, an iconic mountain with a fire tower that has an awesome view. On the trail there are landmarks that mark your progress. So Blood Mountain is the first, then Standing Indian and now Albert Mountain. We march northwards, ticking off the landmarks. Tomorrow, we tick off Franklin. 
3: We go to town in the morning so we have completed phase 1 of our plan. When we started to plan, we agreed Franklin was phase 1. Tomorrow Dandelion will start on phase 2 when we plan to get to Hot Springs by the 23 of April. Watch this space for the new 10 day plan. 
Today we started our hike at 8 and just ambled down the trail. It was slightly downhill and soft , covered with pine needles and no roots or rocks. It felt like we we were taking a walk in the woods. 
Two hours later we reached our first gentle uphill which led to the most amazing view and then down to the foot of Albert Mountain. 
To get to the top of Albert Mountain you climb a gentle hill then turn left and straight up the hill. I am not sure how to explain the climb. 
Straight up rock hopping for about 200 yards is accurate. It is one of those climbs that certainly leaves you breathless. Then you get to the top , breathe in and see 4 States laid out below. The view is amazing. 

Tonight, we are in full shelter with a girl and her dog. We have another dog at the shelter and the two dogs are both on leads. They are growling and flashing teeth at one another. 
I am not sure that taking a dog on an adventure like this is a great idea. It seems like a lot of extra work. 
Supper was jambalaya rice with added mash. Hiker hunger has still not arrived so we are still only cooking half a pot of food. I am sure that will change in the next few days. 
Still healthy and happy.","Beach Gap

A short day into Town. Town day means we were up at 6.45 and ready to roll by 7.30. It is amazing what a little bit of motivation can do to your leg speed. We got to the gap just in time to catch the shuttle bus to town. $3 per ride. Got dropped in the middle of town right next to the coffee and yogurt shop (I don’t know the connection between coffee and yogurt). So the first thing we did was have coffee. 
My sleeping pad has been really cold at night and so some nights it felt as if I was sleeping on an ice block. It made the cold nights colder. I have learned that sleeping pads are rated for their warmth. 5 being great. Mine was 0. I bought a new sleeping pad rated as four seasons 4.6. Looking forward to testing it. Also got new darn tough socks. Feels like a shopping spree. 
Then down to the hostel for a great shower and a private room. It is awesome to unpack your bag and clean up a bit. There always seems to be something hiding in some dry bag or other that needs to go or needs to be found again. 
As I write this we have had supper, and did a small shop. 

Yesterday throwing a bear rope was a challenge. My first throw was perfect so I tied off the rope, ready for later. Later I clip the food bags to the rope and start hoisting the bags. The branch breaks. I now look for a different tree and after finding one , throw the rope, except I forget to hold the other end of the rope so the whole rope goes over the branch. I then put the one end in my pocket and take the bag with the stone and rope and throw it over the branch. This time the bag opens and the stone comes out and the end of the rope hangs about twenty feet off the ground. Mmmm. Determined, I tie in the stone, put the other end in my pocket and SUCCESS at last. Our food was safe from the bears and my self esteem was restored. 

Looking forward to a good nights sleep

The day started with the owner Zen singing us awake at 6.45 am to get us up and ready for the all you can eat hiker breakfast at the First Baptist Church. 4 pancakes, 2 coffees and lots of bacon later, we were dropped off back at the hostel. Stomach a little full. 

Went shopping for resupply at Ingles and walked up and down the isles deciding what we needed and what we wanted. Espresso beans covered in chocolate was my luxury, Dandelion chose rice krispy biscuits. As always, we bought too much and will be carrying extra. Having shopped till we were hungry, we went along to Wendy’s.

We both ordered burgers and fries. I was asked if I wanted a triple. Of course I said yes. I was given triple patties on my burger, triple normal fries and a litre of coke. Enormous. Yes, I finished it and was nicely full. Perhaps this hiker hunger is coming along. 
Tonight we met Michelle for a drink at the lazy hiker brewery and then all you can eat and catfish and pulled pork with salad and vegetables. A small Ben and Jerry ice cream finished the day. Thank you for joining us Michelle.

The hardest thing to do when leaving town is to hoist your backpack. It has suddenly become a lot heavier. 10 pounds heavier in fact. All food for the next few days. Just to add to my mood, the trail goes up and up all the way to Wayah bald. 
A bald is a mountain top with no trees on. Almost like a monks haircut. Very pretty as you come out of the trees and suddenly there is a grass patch. Normally there is a view as well. 
On top of Wayah bald they have built a tower and you get a 180 degree view on NC. 
You can drive up to the tower so there were a number of clean smelling people with little cooler boxes of drinks and snacks. One couple had a flask of coffee. I tried to hint and then hinted some more and then talked about how I missed coffee. They did not catch the hint. They packed up and went home with the flask of coffee. Oh well, I will have to do better next time. 

So 10 miles before lunch, lunch at the bald and then 5 miles to the shelter. A pretty normal day. 

We are camped at 5000 feet and there is a rain and snow storm blowing in tonight. A great time to test the tent and my new sleeping pad. Will give you feedback later. 

There are lots of Germans on the trail at the moment. We have 5 camped with us tonight. Friendly and fun. 

We are all camping because the shelter has been colonized by 5 youngsters. 
The generally accepted rules are: 
1. You only take up enough space for yourself

2. You do not spread all your stuff around everywhere 
3. There is a no loud music allowed 
4. In the shelter you are respectful of others 
Even when camping these rules apply so we are close to 3 other tents because space is limited tonight.

The storm arrived around 9 pm, all blustery and rainy. We were dry and snug in our sleeping bags and tent. In the morning I woke up with the bottom of my sleeping bag wet. The tent was not leaking, but the wee bottle was. (enough said - what happens on the trail stays on the trail) We cleaned up and packed up in the rain and the wind. By 7.30 we were on the road again. 
This morning Blue Bear (from Australia) asks me if we are from South Africa. I say yes. He then asks if we had met The other south African couple on the trail. What are their names, I ask. Springbok and Dandelion he says. Everybody seems to know them. We laughed when I introduced myself. 
Dandelion had her pink rain skirt on and I was a bit more formal with my black rain skirt. No pictures because it was raining and very cold. At times it was sleeting but we are thru hikers and tough. 
When walking in rain and the whole world is grey it takes a bit of mind over matter to keep the spirits up. 
The trail designers helped by taking us along the ridge (exposed to the elements) and taking us up and over every little hill top they could find. At least it kept us warm. 
4.5 hours later we were in the NOC and dropping our bags in front of the restaurant and ordering coffee and pizza. 
When we arrived, Moss came up to us to say that a parcel had been left for us by Aurial at the outfitters. Aurial had drawn a picture of a Springbok and Dandelion on a piece of paper and wrapped up a pack of Oreo cookies for us. Awesome. 

The NOC is full of hikers and lots of hikers we have met over the last few days. 

This afternoon we are in bunkhouse room drying out everything we have. 

Tonight we ate burgers and sweet potato fries. So cool not having to eat packet food. What a social evening. Lots of talk and chatter about the trail. 

Tomorrow we walk out in sleet and rain again.

As I write this blog , I am lying in my tent with the snow gently falling around us. I am in my sleeping bag nice and warm. 

This morning we left the NOC in cold but clear weather. As we climbed we could see snow on the ground but thought very little if it. The higher we got the more snow we found and more ice on the trees. Then it started snowing and we kept climbing.

The higher we climbed the more it snowed. At first it was very exciting walking in the snow. The more it snowed the wetter we got and the colder we got. Luckily for us we kept on climbing and that kept us warm. 
Snow makes everything beautiful and clean. It was fantastic to walk through the snow today. 
Today was a tough day. We climbed big mountains and then the people who designed the trail routed the trail over every small mountain. This meant you are constantly going up and down which is very tiring. 
Then at the end of the day we had to climb Jacobs Ladder 550 feet in 250 yards. That is almost straight up. 

We got to the shelter at 4 but the shelter was already full of young hikers. So we had to pitch our tent in the snow. 
We are learning that you need to be quite tough and resourceful to complete this trail.

Some days are diamonds and some days are stone. Today, even though we were rushing off to a hotel room and the snow was still on the ground it was a stone day. Lots of up and downs and specially those pointless up and downs that take you over a bump (50 metres up and then down again ) with no view. It took us just over an hour to get down from the top if the mountain down to the village. Slow and painful with lots of switchbacks. 

Rant to follow. I think the kids in the shelter last night were really selfish and when hikers come in from the snow and cold, then you tidy up your stuff and make room. It is not great setting up your tent in the snow and trying to cook when your hands are freezing. Not great manners people. Rant over. 

Now for the great news. 
Today we arrived at Fontana Village around 2pm and booked a room. Just as I was paying , Aurial ( hiker who left us trail magic at the NOC) walked in so we invited her to share a room with us. Our treat. 
She is a 22 year old who worked for REI to save enough money to walk the trail. At 13 she was diagnosed with diabetes and carries insulin with her but with all the exercise does not need to inject herself every day. 
Just got back from supper. The food was great but the service was awful. So we ate the food (a giant pizza and salad - wilted lettuce and 2 tomatoes) and left no tip. The power of the customer at work. 

We are showered, re supplied and full. Life is good.

Waking up in a hotel room is really great. No mattress to deflate, no sleeping bag to pack away, toilet in the same room, brushing your teeth in the basin and of course breakfast that can be ordered (egg omelette with bacon and mushrooms). 

The walk up into the Smokies was amazing. Steep but doable. And very pretty. It was a beautiful hot sunny day and soon we were down to t-shirts. We had only loaded a litre of water each. We soon were rationing and praying for water. 
Just around the next corner was an ice cold stream of water straight out of the mountain. We are very aware that God's protective and generous hand is upon us. 
I am also listening to Billy Grahams autobiography. What a great Godly man. 
Just before lunch, we were walking down a gentle path, admiring the carpets of flowers and talking about how great the trail is, when Dandelion slips, finds the only rock for miles around, with her head. Lots of blood but no serious damage. We stopped and started cleaning up the cut, when a hiker with alcohol swabs came past. Five minutes later we were on our way. 
This afternoon was like walking through a garden. Beautiful trees, amazing carpets of flowers, just great walking. 

Today was a great day on the trail, good weather, great trail and nice hikers to talk to. 

The fire tower was amazing. Taking the side trail I went up to the top of the tower. About 100 steps up. Then you can see all around. You can see Fontana dam, the mountains you walked yesterday and the mountains you are going to walk tomorrow. What a great diversion. Dandelion walked on and it took me at least 1.5 hours to catch her. It was interesting walking alone in the woods, looking for the bears. 
The Smokies are having bear problems this year, one camp site was closed and there are signs everywhere to be aware of bears and not to leave food lying around. All food must be hung on the bear cables. 

We are now doing 16 miles a day fairly easily, starting at 8am and ending around 3.30 or 4 pm depending on the climbs. 
Then we have the camp routine down. I fetch and filter water. We then set up tent and while I make the hot chocolate/coffee, Dandelion sets the beds and generally gets the tent ready for the night. Then supper and in bed by 8.30. Fast asleep by 9 and then up by 7 am and we do it all over again. 

Shelter is full tonight ( you can't tent in the Smokies). If you get to a shelter and it is full you are allowed to tent but I sure don't want to tent when there are problem bears around. 

Still healthy and having fun

Today was a busting lung, burning calf type of day. All day we went up a big hill , down a small one and then up a big one. Not sure how this works as there can only be so much up -right? We did gain 2500 feet in elevation so I suppose that makes sense. The views today were amazing until the mist rolled in. 

Tonight we are sleeping above 5000 feet for the first time and once again we are supposed to go below zero. We are becoming mountain people. 

To add to today, it was misty and windy. We are certainly being given lots of opportunity to develop character. It was so cold today that my phone could not take pictures. 
We have caught up with a bubble of hikers. Last night there were 12 of us in the shelter. Tonight the shelter is full and there are at least 20 people in tents. Luckily, most of them are planning on going into town in the morning. That should clear the trail a bit. We will go on and make our next town stop in Hot Springs (next Tuesday ).
Trail friendships are starting to develop. We have been hiking with the same group of people for about a week. Within the group and among single people we can see partnerships develop and then dissolve as new people connect. Interesting.

13.6 miles walked As I write this, we are trapped in our tent. The tent flaps are held together with a loop and toggle. These are frozen together. So here we sit waiting for the sun to thaw the toggles so we can get out. As we get dressed inside the tent, ice is raining down on us from the frozen condensation. 

The sun has come out. What a difference the sun makes. The birds are singing, we are singing and the trail is an amazing place to be. 

First up is Clingmans dome. The highest point on the AT - 6612 feet above sea level. The views were amazing. You could see mountain after mountain and range after range for 360 degrees. Breakfast down at the bottom of Clingmans dome and on we went. 
The majority of hikers went down into Gatlingsberg to resupply. The town kindly runs a shuttle to and from the gap. 
We went on to the Newfound Gap for lunch. Sitting on the grass watching all the tourist driving up to the gap to admire view, then getting back into their cars and driving home. 
We had crackers and cheese for lunch and then a hiker (Proffesor) got dropped off at the gap. He gave us 3 pieces of deep fried chicken. The best kind - fatty and greasy! 
Leaving the gap, we saw a sign saying 1972 mikes to Kathadin. Whoo whoo!! 
Then up into the next climb. 3 miles later (1,15 hours) we were at the shelter. 
The rule is you have to sleep in the shelter unless it is full. So everybody who wants to tent was sitting outside on the grass waiting for the shelter to fill up. We were happy to grab 2 places. 
Supper was a great rice side mixed with mash sitting with Blink, Hikefar and Rocket on the grass, in the sunshine. A perfect ending to an almost perfect day. 

The big dilemma is to walk 20 miles tomorrow and the 13 miles the next day to get out of the Smokies and to a hostel called Standing Bear where you can resupply. Or to walk 13 miles tomorrow and 18 miles the next day. Either way you end up at the same place, it is just about when.

By 7.30 this morning the shelter was empty and most of the tents had been packed up. Standing Bear hostel was waiting. A resupply point that has pizza and sodas and chocolate. A great place to stop if you are hiking. 
We have got to that point in the hike that all we talk about is food. What we are eating and what we have eaten and of course what we are going to eat and where. All you can eat places are a great hit. 

Today we marched down the hill (11 miles) to Standing Bear. We were planning on staying there tonight, but we arrived at 11.45 and after a pizza and soda we decided to move on to a campsite about 3 miles up a 4500 foot climb. By 2 we had arrived. 2 pm being very early, we pushed on, walking fast to beat the rain. 4 pm we were at the shelter and still no rain. The shelter was full so we are in our cozy tent. 
The weather for the next few days is expected to be rainy but not very cold. Oh well, 3 glorious days in the Smokies with sunshine and views where you can see forever, is worth a bit of rain. 

As we entered the Smokies on Wednesday last, there were signs everywhere to be careful of bears. Don’t feed them, don’t touch them. Don’t approach them. Well, we did not even see one. Not one! 

The trail places like Standing Bear have an amazing power to pull people in and hold them. Today we met 2 people who spent 5 days at the hostel. This hostel is in the middle of nowhere. It just seems that the hostel gives them an excuse to stop walking. Hike your own hike is often heard on the trail, so I guess that is what they are doing.

Today we will call one of the most challenging days ever we have had on trail. 

Just as we left the shelter, it started to rain. Not hard but a gentle rain. Like all other days the first 2-3 miles is always up a mountain. As we walked up the mountain the wind started blowing a gale and the sleet started stinging our faces. The higher we climbed, the colder it got and the stronger the winds blew. As we climbed over one mountain we heated up and then froze going down the other side. Up and down we went. Hot then freeze, hot then freeze. 

After 7 miles we reached Max Patch. A large bald. You will remember that a bald is a large grassy patch on top if a mountain. No trees to break the wind. The wind was howling. It blew us up the steps and when we got to the top it blew us off our feet. One mile of fighting the wind, trying to stay on our feet and being blasted with rain. It was literally a battle to get across Max Patch. In the process we both lost our pack covers. Our packs are soaking wet. Luckily everything is in dry bags. 

We rushed down to the nearest shelter to dry out, have lunch and just regroup. There were five or six other hikers there that had crossed Max Patch. They were all wet and shivering. 

Lunch down, we put our wet gear on and hiked on. We were not going to be put off by a little storm. By 3, we were done and arrived at our camp site. Birdie and Termite were here had started a fire. Fire is such a good thing. Then Blueberry and her dog arrived followed by Remedy and Chucklebery. A great social evening with lots of laughs around the fire 

7-15 pm we are in bed. A storm is still raging outside. The wind is howling around and through our tent. 

Our tent is proving to be a challenge and is more like a shelter than a tent. In windy conditions like today, our tent is not very warm or wind proof. This is starting to become a real issue and we are talking about getting a proper tent. (Don’t laugh)
When we set up camp, one of my tasks is to throw the bear line. First you choose a suitable tree, with a suitable branch. Throw the line over the branch and there we go. Just before bed, attach food bags to line and hoist up the tree. Tonight for the second time, the branch broke and down came branch food bag and all. Time to find another tree. Throw the bear bag, the line gets stuck and my carabiner gets stuck on a branch. Nothing else to do but break the line and say goodbye to my carabiner. 

 It has been that kind of day. Tomorrow we walk into town for good food, a good bed and resupply. Yippee","Ground Hog Shelter

Today was a day of great celebration - Town day. We walked into Hot springs and the first thing we did is stop at the diner and order a large burger with all the trimmings. 

The trail today was the normal up and downs, except that today we had two long downhills (5 miles and 4 miles). Of course in between there were the usual up hills. The thing with long downhills, it sure is hard on your knees and your feet. Today they took a beating. We both have sore feet and blisters on the side of our feet. 
When we got to Hot springs, there was a small problem with our accommodation. 
3 days ago I booked at the Creek Side Motel for three nights. However, I don’t know why - perhaps trail brain, I wrote down Alpine Motel. Alpine Motel is on the main road except it has been closed for about a year. We waited outside for an hour before we realized something was wrong. Off I go to find alternative booking and find a room at the Iron Horse. Connected to wifi I realize that we had booked at the Creekside lodge. So tonight we have two rooms. However, all is not lost. 
The laundromat driers are not working, so we have a room to dry our washing and a room to sleep in. We are fancy hikers. 

Supper tonight is a big pizza and beer. I am lying in bed nursing a food baby. So good to be full and in a nice clean bed. 

The big decision now is to stay two or three nights in Hot Springs. We need to rest up a bit. The wet socks and shoes of the last two days has started to cause problems with our feet and we need to see to that. We also need to resupply for the 5 days to Erwin.

There is a lot to be said about rest. Just lazing around allowing our bodies to rest, specifically our feet. They are starting to get that tingling feeling every night as our feet try to recover from the days walk. Dandelion also has a dire right foot (on top) which google tell us is tendonitis. The cure is to loosen her laces and to stretch her calve muscles. 

It is also a time to stock up on protein and caffeine. We have eaten burgers (2 patties) and all the trimmings as well as Southern fried chicken (very very very good). Pancakes for breakfast with bacon and sausage. I think we have sort of filled the food hole. It seems that we cannot eat enough to stop that hungry feeling. I have also stocked up on caffeine with the free refills offered everywhere we eat. 
Beer is expensive so we drink coffee and water when we eat out. 
On the gear side, we have replaced our backpack covers that were blown off on Max Patch, a new spoon for Dandelion, a new carabiner for the bear rope (long story) and a gas canister. 
A full resupply for the next 5 days as we march on to Erwin.

Just 6 miles to go to the 300 mile mark and 18 miles to go to the 500 km mark. We will do both of these in the next two days. 500 km walked in less than a month. Woo hoo. 
It is amazing what a good rest can do. How it revitalizes your body, sorts your mind out and prepares you for the next stretch of the adventure. Hot Springs did that. 2,5 days of town is exactly what we needed to regroup and motivate ourselves for the next section. All our gear back up and working. 
We powered out of town. 
Plans changed as we walked. So today as we walked our first plan was to walk 11 miles to the first shelter. We got there by lunch. Next plan is to walk another 5 miles and find a stealth camp site. Problem: no water. Final plan walk 19 miles for the day and camp at the shelter. We are camped at the shelter with about 15 other hikers and a great social evening was had by all. To succeed on the trail you need to be flexible. 
 As we were leaving Hot Springs this morning, Russia (from Colorado- don’t know why she is called that ) joined us and walked with us the rest of the day. She is section hiking and will leave the trail in Erwin. 
At supper tonight it emerged that there are about 10 of us who all have the same time frame to finish the walk and it seems we we will be seeing a fair amount of each other over the next 4 months. 
Tonight is the first night we can lie in the tent and leave the flaps open and watch the sun set. Awesome. The dial up bird is singing as the sun goes down. Pure bliss. 
While it was great to be in town with good food and an on suite bathroom, it is also good to be out in the forest again. 
While in Hot Springs we did some research on our tent. We discovered that our tent poles (hiking sticks ) were set to low and that was the cause of the breezy problem. Tonight tent set up perfectly. Springbok is a happy camper. 
Another great day on the AT.

17 miles walked 
After a fantastic evening with an amazing sunset and a great sleep, the plan was to walk 14 miles to the next shelter. 
The trail was good with a few steep ups to keep us warm, some downs to allow for some rest, but lots of contour walking, allowing us to cover 14 miles in just 6 hours. 
Then we heard the rumor of a hostel 3 miles down the trail that would shuttle us into Erwin to a Mexican restaurant and Walmart. No brainer. Off we went to the hostel and it was true. There were sodas for $2 and camping for $10. 
The food at the restaurant was good and plentiful. We both had little food babies at the end of the meal. (I even have supper for tomorrow night). A great decision to walk 3 miles. 
We have become part of this moving train of people hiking north. Everyday we now walk with people we know. Sometimes catching people, sometimes being caught, but we rarely meet new people. We are all on the same time table to get to Kathadin. It is just one big family, all offering support to one another to get the end 
Breakfast thus morning was high on the ridge which forms the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. You can see forever.

A cold cold start this morning. 5 degrees. Luckily the trail went up and up this morning. A great way to warm up. 
As we started the walk, the lucky 6 walked passed and joined the climb. As we climbed we passed more hikers. By the end of the climb we had a train of 16 hikers trudging up the hill. A conga line of hikers dancing up the hill. 
At the top we all separated, some going slower, some speeding up but for the rest of the day we passed one another, stopping for conversation and a quick laugh. 
Because today was going to be a short day we stopped for breakfast, then second breakfast. At second breakfast, we were serenaded by the lucky 6. We reciprocated with Nkosi Sikikele. 

Then word came down the trail that there was trail magic at the next gap. From a slow walk we changed gears and moved into fast forward. 
What a feed. 3 tables of food. Pulled pork, chicken, salads, sweets, biscuits and drinks. It took us an hour and a half to leave. 
We are camped at Low Gap with 5 other tents and lots of social.

Today was Big Bald day. We had stopped short yesterday because we wanted to walk across the Bald in good weather. What a great decision that turned out to be. The weather was fantastic. The view was 180 degrees of amazing beauty. Mountains and valleys as far as the eye can see. We had to stop for breakfast. We were joined by Just and Strong and Flowers. It took an hour to eat breakfast and get tired of the view, but eventually we had to leave and march on down the trail. This is the last shelter before Erwin and we wanted to get here early, set up the tent and relax. The plan is for a short 6 miles into Erwin and spend the day on eating and resupply. Of course a hotel room and a bed. 
The rest of today's walk was just amazing, walking through forest with a carpet of flowers. Then a climb up next to a beautiful cascading waterfall falling tumbling down next to us as we climbed up about 400 feet. 
Wish you all could be here just to see that. 

The art if throwing a bear rope was refined last night. 
The only suitable tree was a high 25 meter throw. Russia threw her bear line and J then tied his stronger line to hers. The plan was to hang all 6 bags from one strong line. We tied all the bags to the line and Flowers and I lifted the bags while J pulled the line. The knot came loose and all the bags and line landed in a heap at my feet. 
Next plan was to use two bear lines. If we could throw both lines together then that would be great. We tied the lines together to the throw bag and then the fun began. We had to get both lines over one branch in one throw. 5 throws later we had hikers lined up to test their bear line throwing skills. Some went to the left of the tree. Some were just too low. Some got the line stuck on a root and the bag came crashing back, missing heads and toes by inches. J steps up and on his first throw gets it. The prize, a Snickers bar. 

We have also decided that we are not eating enough and need to re-look how we are feeding ourselves. We need to take away snickers and instant energy and add a lot more protein. The way to do that is to carry more protein bars. You can buy them at large supermarkets. We also need to get something to add to our water to replace the minerals and salts we are losing. 

Dandelion has been telling everybody we meet on the trail about the all you can eat KFC in Erwin. The reaction ranges from great - see you there and some have an amazingly strong negative reaction to KFC. The result of all this is that some people are calling Dandelion ""The Colonel"". Seems this name may stick. 
Russia has decided that she is enjoying the trail so much that she is staying on for another two weeks. I am now being teased about having 2 wives. 

Our feet are sore today and we need to start thinking about replacing our shoes. 500 miles is about their limit. Will see if we can get them sent to Damascus by 8 May.

Town day. Today is town day. 
The tents came down early, the shelter empties quickly and by 7.30 we are on the trail and doing at least 3 miles per hour. If you have planned correctly your pack is light and your food bag is empty. Breakfast is in town. 

Arriving at the hostel at the edge of town, the first thing to do is to buy coffee. $1.50 gets you a cup and one free refill. We all sit on the deck and catch up with some of the hikers just leaving town. We swap stories of the hike, who is where ( both ahead of us and behind us) and what is good in Erwin. 
We needed to get to resupply and then to our hotel. Russia our hiking partner left the trail a week ago but had hired a car while in Erwin. She offered us the use of the car for 2 hours. 5 of us piled straight to Walmart for resupply. 
We bought lots of high protein bars and quick freeze dried meals and then onto the hotel, check in and let the day begin. 
By 12 noon we are showered and our laundry is on the line. 
Dandelion and I are off to KFC for lunch. We bought enough for a small family. There was not a crumb left. 
The rest of the day was spent lying on the bed and reading and sleeping. I like this kind of day. 
At 6, 10 hikers went out to the Hawg and Dawg and ate hot dogs with coleslaw and chips. Some of us may have had two main meals. On the way home we bought a pint of Ben and Jerry ice cream to share.

Our shuttle arrived while we were having breakfast. What a breakfast it was. Waffle with banana, black berries, red berries and maple syrup. It was delicious, especially since there was unlimited coffee. 
The shuttle dropped us off at the trail head. Today was a day of 3 big climbs. 

The first one out of Erwin took about two hours, followed by trail magic at the gap. Lemonade and chocolate brownie and then a good climb up to Beauty Spot. Each of these climbs leave you red faced and breathless. We have taken to stopping once or twice just to catch our breath. 

Lunch was on top of Beauty Spot. Dandelion had made chicken mayonnaise buns for us with lettuce and real butter. It was a great lunch. 

The afternoon climb up Unaca Mountain was testing. But the forest at the top green with pine needles under foot worth the climb. Then a nice downhill to the shelter. 
Just another great day at the shelter. By 5.30 the tent is up, the water filtered for the next day and water boiling for hot chocolate and coffee. 

The in thing at the moment is stretching at the end of each day. As I write this, Dandelion and Russia are stretching. 5 other hikers around me are stretching various muscles. Some interesting poses that should not and will not be photographed. 

We are really enjoying the sunshine and being able to walk in shorts and a t shirt. Every water source we pass we dip our caps or bandannas in the ice cold water. Refreshing. 
The sunshine also means we take more breaks and just enjoy the views or the water.

15.7 miles walked. 
What an interesting day. With only 15,7 miles to walk it was an easy day. 
We left camp at 7.45 and by 8.45 we had done 3 miles. So we stopped for breakfast.While eating, our friends who had slack-packed 20 miles yesterday came walking past. Slack-packing is where someone drops you with a day-pack away from a town or hostel and you walk back. A nice way to cover miles quickly, but is normally quite expensive. 
Then an hour later we all stopped for water and a 30 minute rest. 
After another hour it was time for an early snack so we all stopped for another half an hour. Then one o clock was lunch next to a stream for half an hour for lunch 
We are walking quite fast, so by lunchtime we were only 6 miles short of our camp site. 
This afternoon we started one of the hardest climbs on the trail. A climb up Roan Mountain, 4029 feet to over 5500 feet in 3 miles. 
The trail switchbacks up the mountain, so you are constantly walking uphill for 3 miles. It was hot and sunny and not even a gentle breeze. This is definitely the toughest climb on the trail so far for us. 
By 3.45 we were done. Packs down and tent up. 

We are camped half way up the mountain with pine trees all around us. Very pretty. 

Russia's ankle has a deep hole in it from her shoes rubbing along the whole day. We are helping her doctor this to make sure she can carry on.
Tomorrow we will tackle the last 1500 meters to the top. 
Top 5 physical challenges of the hike for us: 

1 Walking steeply downhill for 500 metres at the end of the day to fetch water. Especially if it is really steep. We fill a 10 litre bag and then carry 10 kg back up to camp. Then the water still needs to be filtered. 
2 Getting out of your tent in the morning. Putting both feet on the ground and curling yourself out of your tent. 
3 Carrying and eating enough food to keep the hunger at bay. Food is the heaviest item in our bags. The snacks and protein bars weigh a lot. Without them, we would just not have the fuel to walk for 8 hours a day and do between 15 and 20 miles. We also need enough food to allow our bodies to recover each night. 
4 Everyday, parts of your body take turns to hurt. It may be your shoulders that hurt from the backpack, your foot because it feels like it or it could be you have pulled a muscle or done some serious damage. The hard part is knowing which is which and act accordingly.

5 The last mile of the day. It is normally uphill to the shelter so that last mile is drawing the last of your energy and sometimes your good humor. 

The trick is managing these challenges in such a way that they become a normal part of your daily routine and life on the trail. So far I think we are doing a good job.","Cherry Gap Shelter

An old red barn that has been converted into a shelter. The grass in front of the barn is freshly mowed. I am lying in the sun on the grass writing this blog.Life on the trail can be idealistic.
Today was a short 9 mile hike to get to the shelter. A 2 mile climb and a gain of 1000 feet to start with to get up and over Roan Mountain. I think this is one of the last 5000 feet mountains for a while. Then we had trail magic at the Roan Mountain parking lot. Chips and soda and fruit and nuts. A great first breakfast.
Up the bald we marched. This is day hiker territory so the trails are wide, the incline gentle and the markings great. On top of the Bald it was time for second breakfast. Just love this concept of first breakfast and second breakfast.Then we aimed for the shelter. 12.30 back packs off and coffee on the boil.A great short day that allows us to lie in the sun for the afternoon and just rest.The view from the shelter is spectacular as you look down the valley. There is rain predicted for tomorrow so we are making the most of today.
5 things that are magical on the trail:
1: Waking up in your tent and seeing the most amazing sunrise almost every morning. The same at night when the sun goes down as you snuggle in your sleeping bag and watch the light fade.2: The sounds of the forest as the birds sing, the wind rushes through the trees or the water tumbles down the mountain. Then there are also times of absolute silence.3: The social interaction at the end of each day as you meet new hikers, reconnect with those you know, swopping stories of the day, as well as general banter.4: The community of hikers that share the same dream and goal to do a Thru Hike. The support, encouragement and sharing you give and receive as we all move up along this footpath.5: Trail magic and the people who spend so much time and money just standing at a gap and feeding all us hungry dirty hikers. It is difficult to explain the excitement of receiving trail magic as well as the feeling of gratitude.
All of the above keep us walking yet the most powerful motivator is the marking off day by day our progress up the trail. Every 15 or 18 miles walked moves us a little bit closer to our goal.
Lastly, we are hugely conscious of Gods provision and His answering of our simple prayers as we walk. It is indeed a humbling experience.

But let me tell you about today. 
We had to walk up Little Hump, a smallish grassy bald that got us warmed up. We left the shelter at 6.30 because we knew today was going to be a big day. Then came Big Hump. Big Hump is over 5000 feet with not one switchback in sight. You walk straight up the front. The views from the top make it all worthwhile. Down 3000 feet through some awesome forests and meadows to meet Dave and Jim who are joining us for the weekend. 
At the road we go to the Harbor Mountain hostel and they have a food truck. I have been dreaming of a hamburger for days so I ordered a Thru hiker burger ( 2 patties, bacon, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and onion on a toasted bun). Craving satisfied.The afternoon walk was a gentle up and down until we got to a road crossing and trail magic. An ice cold beer on a warm afternoon. 
The trail then ran next to a river where we watched people catching trout.

The afternoon climb was a bit more of a challenge now we had full backpacks and all the weight back. It was really hot (I know we moaned about the cold) as we climbed and none of us had enough water. At last 2 miles before the shelter there was a slow spring, enough to wet our heads and fill our water bottles. We will never take water from a tap for granted ever again. 
Todays water source was the worst ever. We are camped at the highest point with an amazing view of the dam. The water source is down in the valley 500 feet below us on a steep side trail. It took me half an hour to fetch water. I arrived back at the shelter hot and sweaty (and a little grumpy).

Then you get the slightly noisy gurgle.These two are normally managed by earplugs. 
Then you get the chainsaw. So loud that nobody can sleep. 
We had a chainsaw camped right next to us, right behind the shelter. Just as we we wanted to go to sleep he started up. By 12 he was still going and he had been joined by two others. It was too much for Strong, who lost it and told everyone to shut up. They did for 5 minutes and then started up again. 
People who snore really badly should not camp right next to people. Today we are both a bit grumpy. Rusha had a bad day today. 
First she walked into branches that hang across the trail. 3 times. Then she had to have a toilet stop. First you find a quite spot,then you dig a hole, squat, wipe and close the hole. Rusha got the first three right,then reaching back for her toilet piper, put her hand in the hole. 
Her new trail name may be ""Rusha poo hands"". The lesson. Always know where you have put your toilet paper.

Damascus is a great town. Great food, great accommodation and full of hikers. We had a great time in the town. But to make the miles you have to walk. 
We were told about the creeper trail, a trail that runs along the river for about 9 miles with no real ups or downs. The trail meets the AT at mile 485. This meant we could walk 9 miles, make 15 miles on the AT and miss all the ups and downs and twirls the trail does coming out of Damascus. 
The negative is that you miss a few miles of walking on the AT. The positive is you still walk north, meet the AT and walk 18 miles of the AT by 2. Then you can find a pine forest to camp in and spend the afternoon resting your feet. 

I bought new shoes in Damascus and they fit perfectly. Because they are new, the orthopedic inserts are working properly, stopping my feet from rolling. Today this hurt my feet a bit and my knee is complaining. It is good to take a short day. 

The pine forest is amazing to camp in. Soft under your tent. We spent the afternoon just relaxing and catching up on our reading. 
Around 4pm, a thunderstorm came through. Light rain but it was good to see our tent is waterproof and dries quickly. 
Camping tonight with Jay, Strong and Rusha. Bleep, Bojingles and Flower Boy join us when it works for them. 
We walk separately but meet up at the shelters or campsite at night for supper together and normally some good conversation and laughs.

It is amazing how many old hikers we meet on the trail who want to relive their experiences. This trail seems to suck you in and never let you go. 
The rest of the day until lunch time was walking through the forest running into large groups of day hikers. They are normally slower than us. One group shouted “step aside thru hikers coming thru! “ as they moved off the trail. That was funny. 
Then we crossed into the Grayson highlands. 
We met Dave and deanne on the trail about 1 mile from the turnoff to the parking lot. They had walked up the trail to meet us. Dave and Deanne were camping at a camp site nearby. 
What a dinner. Steak , sausage and salad. And as much beer, cold drinks or Spier wine we could drink. We ate and ate and every one of us had a food baby. 
Dave and Deanne fed us and then some. We will have food for lunch tomorrow. 
We are sharing a tent tonight. All 5 of us in one tent. Should be fun.","Camp Site

Miles walked 22,8 

Let me start by saying we did not plan a long day. It was just that we could not find a suitable campsite before the shelter. This meant we just had to keep in hiking. 
The weather is getting hotter and the streams are drying up. We are a little concerned about the water situation and have decided to make this part of our planning process. We don’t want to carry too much water as it is heavy , but at the same time we don’t want to get dehydrated. I think we just need to plan our water stops to make sure we always have enough. 
Dave was up early to start the fire and get the coffee and breakfast on the go. It was almost civilized to stand around and drink coffee and eat bacon and egg buns for breakfast. Thank you Dave and Deanne. 
By 8-15 we were in the trail with the idea of walking till we were tired. Today was a pretty walk. Through meadows and green forests with no big ups and no major downs. 
Just before lunch we heard a rumor of trail magic at the next road crossing. We sped up and went rushing down the trail to find that we were too late. The people had packed up and gone home. Feeling a bit glum we crossed the road and then crossed a river. Lots of hikers were swimming. We didn’t stop because we had a mountain to climb and wanted to get it done. On the other side we stopped for lunch near a stream where we could cool down. 
Lunch was a roll with left over steak, potatoes and a piece of sausage. Then this afternoon just as we were starting our last climb, a car stopped and asked if we wanted colddrinks and cinnamon rolls. Of course we said yes. Just another amazing day on the trail. 
Yesterday we were told about a bear about 100 miles back that had learned to knock down food bags from where they were hanging in the trees. The bear had succeeded for 5 nights in a row to steal a food bag. Tonight J and I made extra sure our bags were hung high and away from the tree stem. 
We also saw a hiker yesterday taking his dog and cat for a hike. The dog on a leash and the cat ( very undignified)in a sling/pouch hanging in front. 

Physically and mentally doing very well. We have lots of people camped around each night and so the evenings are very social. On the physical side the mountains are not as high as in Georgia and North Carolina and we are very definitely a lot fitter.","Massie Gap

Allow me to rant (again). Shelter etiquette is: you consider other hikers. Last night around 9.30 when we were all in our tents fast asleep, 3 hikers decided to hang their bear lines and put up their tents. Their headlamps flashing across our tents and waking us up. This went on for 10 minutes. What made it worse was they arrived early and sat and talked until 9.30. Not cool. 
We lost our cool and asked them to stop. Apparently not done. Oops. 

This morning was a short 10 mile walk to the shelter and pick up by the bus to go into Marion. The pick up was listed as 11 am. 
At 10 am we had 2.3 miles to go. 
We put foot and did the miles in 45 minutes arriving in time to catch the bus. On the bus was a couple from Ireland. They are also walking the trail, so no doubt we will run into them again. Had a great chat about rugby and all things Irish. 
It is a little overwhelming to go shopping in a Walmart or Food Lion. The choices are so wide and you know what you buy, you have to carry. We bought a fair amount of fruit and sort of had a food feast. You do things while on this trail that you would not normally do. 
Had mexican food for supper with Thumper - a Canadian. Lots of other hikers in town so lots of social interactions and discussions. The majority about where to eat and the weather. 
The weather for the next week is going to be rain, rain and more rain. Looking forward to the world cooling down a bit and the streams running to give water. Not looking forward to the thunderstorms. We will just have to time our walks over the high mountains to avoid the storms. I will also keep the tent close to the top of my pack in case we need to shelter quickly . 
As the saying goes. No pain no rain no Maine. 
Dandelion got new shoes today. Hope that is going to fix the sore feet on the downhill and rocks. 

Lastly we weighed ourselves. We have both lost a lot of weight. I have lost more than Dandelion ( had more to loose), but she is adding muscle from all that climbing.","Trimpi Shelter

Miles walked 18.3 

We have passed the quarter way mark. 42 days to walk 551.8 miles. Average of 13.2 miles or 20 km a day including our off days. We need to average 13.7 days to get to Kathadin by 7 September. Seems we may need to start walking slightly further each day. Virginia is quite flat so we should be able to up our daily mileage to around 20. A few of those days and we will be good. 
Our walk today went like this: 

Leave Marion at 7.40am. Thanks Jim for the shuttle. 
8am start walking. 
8.25am first big climb. 600 feet up no switchbacks. Straight up a mountain. 
9.15am top of first hump. 
9.45am bottom of the hump. Start to climb next hump. Straight up 450 feet. 
10.25am top of next hump (still no views). 
11.00am bottom of second hump. 
11.30am top of next hump 400 feet up (still no switchbacks). 
12.15am down the mountain alongside a beautiful stream and then into an old schoolhouse. The school was opened in 1870 and closed in 1939. Only One classroom. Some rules that today would be frowned on. Example boys and girls playing together - 3 lashes. 
Inside there was a sign saying trail magic but all we could see was hand sanitizer and toilet paper. I lifted the lid of one of the wooden boxes and there it was. Cold drinks, chips and lots of goodies. We were so excited it felt as if we were young and back at school.

1 pm. Town of Atkins and we stopped at the gas station and had cold drinks and lunch (chicken mayonnaise rolls made by Dandelion while we were in Marion). 
1.30pm moved on to the next gas station and bought ice cream. Ran into M&M again (Irish couple also thru hiking). Great conversation. A lady heard us talking, googled Appalachian trail and came rushing over to talk to us. Wanted a quick interview with Dandelion. Then two more ladies came out and wanted to buy as a cold drink each. We were just too full to say yes. 
2pm started walking with 7 miles to go and a big thunderstorm threatening. Quickly crossing 2 meadows and then into the woods. 
2.30-4 pm climbed up and down little mountains and hills. Up 100 feet down, 50 feet up, 75 feet down, 100 feet all afternoon with not one switchback. We have realized that being fit does not mean you don't huff and puff up a hill, it just means that when you get to the top you can carry on walking and recover quickly. 

4 pm set up camp and rest. We are alone tonight with 10000000 mosquitoes all trying to get their pint of blood. It is a pretty campsite, right next to water and flat.  And now the rain has started.  The weather forecast is for 7 day of scattered showers. Seems we may be getting wet in the next few days. It is snug and dry in our tent. 

Just another amazing day on the trail. 
Oh yes! Trail days is this weekend in Damascus. A festival over three days that celebrates the trail. There will be many equipment vendors and lots of people (40000) will attend. Traditionally it has been lots of drinking and one big party. Lots of hikers are shuttling back to Damascus to attend the party or have slowed down to be in Damascus this weekend. That is why the trail is so quite at the moment. Today we saw 3 other hikers.

Miles walked 17.4 

Woke up this morning with water in our tent. Not a lot but enough to get us a little worried. We have sent a mail to Zpacks to ask what we need to do fix this. 
Rain has been forecast for every day until next Friday. Rain is good for a number of reasons: 
1 It cools the world down and if it is not raining too hard then it is great to hike in. 
2 It gets the streams flowing and so collecting water is a lot easier. 
3 Everything will be green in a few days and that is great. 
Rain is bad because: 
1 Everything is wet and clammy. 
2 You get rashes from wearing wet clothes - not comfortable. 
 That said, we would prefer the rain to the snow and the freezing fog. 
Some hikers stay in the shelters or hostels when it rains, waiting for better weather to hike in. Our view is that the miles need to be done and it is better to get them done and then dry out at the shelter or hostel. Also, we have spent money on wet weather gear and feel that we need to use them. 
Today they were used and passed the test. Sort of. By the end of the day we were soaked to the bone, but we did walk in rain for most of the day. 

Our walk today was mostly little bit up and then down except for the first hour of the day when we climbed a big mountain with great switchbacks and the last 2.5 hours when we climbed up to the shelter (4407 feet) with no switchbacks. This is hard to understand - such different trails from the same state. Of course the no switchback trail also had rock and roots to scramble over. 
The shelter we are staying at tonight is the only shelter that has four walls and a door. Very comfortable. 

In the middle, we stopped at a hiker hostel to eat our breakfast. Rusha announced that the rain was just the final straw and her wet boots would give her blisters and she was going home. Just like that we were back to being just the two of us. 

That is the way of the trail. People come and people go. We will move on and meet new people.

Bland days in hostel 591.3 
Miles walked 22.1 

The weather forecast was for rain all day and so we made the decision to walk to Bland and find a hostel to dry out and clean up. 
Yesterday was wet wet wet and everything we walked in was soaking and smelly. Even though we hung everything up in the shelter to dry, nothing dries in this damp weather. 
Our clothes are clean and are being dried as we speak. 

Back to today. There was no rain. We left the shelter at 6.30am because we had a long day. Our guide books said flat but there seemed a lot of ups and downs for the first part of the morning. 
Then we met a hiker that left Zimbabwe in 1995 and now lives in Virginia. A great and quick 2 hour hike brightened the day. He walked fast and the conversation was good. The trail flattened out and the sun came out. He went to the shelter for a “smoke” and we climbed our first big climb of the day. 
Then down hill to Laurel Falls for lunch next to the raging river (there has been lots of rain). 

Then almost the best uphill we have had on the trail. Nice gentle switchbacks and good music from my phone shot us up the mountain. The rest of the day was gentle contour walking. 
4 pm and the day was over. 
At the crossing was a small cafe so we had sodas and fries while we waited for Jeremy to come and fetch us. 
Tonight we sleep in a bed after a hot shower. 

The key debates between myself and Dandelion at the moment are:

1. Can we continue to do long days +-18 miles a day and still stay strong for the next 4 months or should we be slowing down a bit but risk not making Kathadin by middle of September. This is an ongoing discussion. Anyway, this weekend will be two short days. 
2. What can we eat to up our protein level that we are not tired of already. The food we eat is tasty but quite bland. Example Mountain House brand lasagna with a bag of mash. That should feed 4 people but we polish that and then look for more. It is not just quantity but also quality of food. The same goes for our snacks. It is becoming quite a challenge to keep up our energy levels during the day.

What a day. We filled our bucket of building character and completely filled the bucket of perseverance and emptied the sense of humor bucket. 
Even though we were slack packing and our bags were being dropped off at the Trent grocery store, the day did not go well. 
Firstly it rained all day and the trail was like a stream. 
Secondly there was mud everywhere making the trail slippery. 
Thirdly our feet look like ""dead man's too long in water"" feet. We have had three days of walking in wet shoes. 
Fourthly everything we walk in is wet. Our clothes and socks and shoes - all wet. 
Fifthly the first stream we crossed, Dandelion slipped and put both feet in the water. Not that it mattered but it was not a good start. 
The whole day we walked in the rain. 

Now for the good news. 
We are camped in a nice camp site with a store that serves hot food. 
They have a washer and drier so at least our clothes are dry. 
The camp site is level and that is great news. 
Inside our tent is dry and warm. 
Just had a burger and fries at the cafe and enjoyed talking to the other hikers camped with us. 

I have been asked about finances so let me give you two examples. 
1: Last night we resupplied for 3 days at a small store in Bland and bought a pizza for supper and a ham and cheese roll for breakfast. Plus we stayed in the hostel and paid for washing our clothes and the shuttle from the trail plus him dropping our backpacks at the store. That cost $120. 
2: In Marion we resupplied at Walmart for 5 days. That cost $86 and for the five days we were in the forest we stayed for free. It is a balancing act between budget and comfort. Sometimes you just need the comfort to make you feel excited about the trail again. 

Someone asked what we talk about all day. 
1: About other hikers, where they are, what they said, what their plans are and if we should be doing something similar. 
2: About our plans for the hike in the next few days. 
3: Our plans for when the hike is finished.

4: The bible reading we read that morning and what that meant to us. 
5: The books we are reading or listening to. 
At other times we just walk in silence, each of us deep in thought until something happens like meeting another hiker that breaks into that. 

I forgot to mention yesterday that we met Pappi. He is 87 years old and is attempting to be the oldest person to thru hike the trail. He had already hiked it once when he was 60. He has also done the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail. Impressive.

Today was a beautiful hike from the ankles up. The trail was flat and wandered next to and across a raging creek for about three hours. The sun was shining and the forest was green. A quick breakfast at Wapiti Shelter and then a steep one mile climb of just under 1200 feet to get the heart pumping and sweat pouring. Then a gradual climb up and over the ridges with an amazing view of the valley below. By one we had arrived at the hostel. 
Our hike from the ankles down was another matter. We were dealing with the aftermath of three days of rain. It was pure mud with a few raging streams thrown in. After 5 minutes we decided to just walk in the mud and clean our shoes in the raging streams. 

Let met tell you about Woodshole. It is an amazing place to spend some time. We are in a private luxury tent, lying in a double bed, with a duvet. Luxury. 
The first thing we did was shower. A long hot shower and then an afternoon nap, with a cat on the bed. 

Supper tonight was organic home grown salad and fresh home baked bread, lentil curry ( mince on the side for us protein junkies) a ice cream for desert, home made of course. 

Jay, Strong and Flower Boy will catch up tomorrow as we have decided to zero here and take a rest. We have walked 150 miles (245 km) since last Friday. Time for a rest and time to fill our sense of humor bucket.

Dandelion is in charge of the planning and she has decided that we should start this next week with a short hike over a little mountain into town to resupply and last big supper before we head out for 5 days. 
We also will use the time to check our gear and make sure everything is in working order. 

Dandelion is doing an amazing job managing this schedule. We are both still feeling fairly strong and are injury free. A lot of this had to do with her planning. 

We left the hostel at 8 after a cup of coffee and strolled over the mountain. A great walk along a nice trail. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, the chipmunks were scurrying along. We strolled and talked and enjoyed an easy morning walk. 
In Pearisberg by 12.30 we stopped off at Dairy Queen for a large chocolate milkshake and then off to find a room. We booked the last room at the Plazza motel (not hotel). The room has 3 double beds so J, Strong and Pathfinder are sharing with us. 
We had just gone shopping when the rain started and we got wet. 

Tonight we went out for Mexican and then back to dairy cream for ice cream. Suppers out are really great. It makes such a difference not eating out of one pot. 

We are at that stage of the hike that we recognize most of the hikers around us and so every meal becomes a group affair. Lots and lots of fun for all. 
The next week is going to be really exciting: 
1 Dragons Tooth. A part of the trail that requires some rock climbing down and ladders. 
2 Home place restaurant. All you can eat southern fried chicken. 
3 4 pines hostel. An old garage converted to a hostel. 
4 Macafee Knob - the place to have your picture taken. 
5 Tinker cliffs with views that are amazing. 
4 Daleville and memorial day weekend. Strong has a friend there who may take us in.

Today was a day to see animals. 
The start of the first climb there were 3 deer on the hillside, happily feeding while we walked past. Then a tortoise crossed our path. Not a very friendly fellow, he just sat there, so we moved on. Then the siting of the day. A mother bear with her two cubs about 30 yards up off the trail. The cubs played on the rocks while mother bear watched us. We watched for about 5 minutes then quietly walked past. At last we have seen a bear. 
The rest of the day was uneventful from a walking point of view. We walked out of Pearisberg on a major road for about a mile and then started the first climb. Just a little warm up. At the start of the second climb we were stopped by a Sheriff and warned to stay on the trail. It turns out that there are protesters camped in the woods. They are protesting against the building of a pipeline across the Appalachian mountains. We did not see anything, and yes we stuck to the trail. As always the views from the top were amazing. 

We have established a pattern of fast up the hills (J and Strong) and fast downhill ( Myself and Dandelion). We walk as we need to and stop for breaks and chats at water points and lunch. At the end of the day, we camp together and have fun. Tonight it is raining so we are all in our tents. Tonight we are camped next to a stream and I can hear the rushing water as I write this. There is something soothing about that sound that puts you to sleep. 
The jury is still out on our tent. Single skin tents are light, easy to put up and very quick to dry and take down. The issue is that they are not always as waterproof as they should be. Tonight it is not raining hard but every now and then we feel a splash in our faces. We need to decide if we can live with this and keep a lightweight tent or buy a tent with a rain-fly but carry a lot heavier. 
Carrying extra weight is a big issue and so this is not an easy decision.The more weight you carry the larger your chance of injury, the harder it is to climb hills, your energy levels are rapidly depleted and it can be demoralizing to pick up a heavier pack, especially when the tent is wet. 
Perhaps getting a little wet is not so bad. We will see. 
Our trail family has grown by one as Blue Bear (an Australian) has joined us. 
We have decided that we need to do the miles every day but also make memories and have fun doing it. Today was a perfect example of walking hard, ( 3 miles per hour) but also stopping for an hour's lunch and a bit of a rest.","Pearisberg

Today was one of the hardest days on the trail. 
It started with a walk through mud and then a steep 1000 foot climb straight up the mountain in less than a mile. To make it worse, the trail was rock and mud. This was followed by 3 hours of walking on a level but really rocky trail. 
Stopping for breakfast at a rock with a 30 foot drop, I stepped on the rock, slipped and went sliding towards the drop. I managed to roll to one side and into the bush next to the rock. It would not have ended well if I had gone over the edge. God has His hand on us. 
Lunch was a great a time with at least 15 of us sitting around talking. Blue bear (Australian) and I were trying to explain the game of cricket. We may need to try again later. 
As we walked out after lunch, Dandelion almost stepped on a black mouse snake. They are big 5 feet long but harmless. But a snake is a snake. 
This afternoon was a 2000 foot climb straight up. It took us just over 2.5 hours to do 4 miles. It was hot and the trail was mud and rock and not one switchback. It was murder on our feet and then down 2000 feet on rocky trail. Today is the first day that my feet are really hurting. ( I will need a pain pill tonight. ) 
The flies and midges are out and so you need to breath through your nose or risk swallowing swarms of midges and then coughing. Coughing is hard when you have no breath because you walking uphill. 
Everyone at the shelter is walking on beaten up feet. 

On the positive side, it did not rain today and we could all sit outside and cook and eat together. 
The social on the trail keeps us motivated and the group we are hiking with are fun and there is lots of laughter and insults. 

We are watching the weather. The forecast for Monday is for a storm system to be moving through that will dump 10-15 inches of rain on the trail. That is a lot if rain. We may go and hide in Dalesville on Monday.","Camp site

My apologies. It seems I got the number of days on the trail mixed up. We are at day 51 of our walk and tomorrow we pass the third of the way mark. Who would have believed it. 
If yesterday sucked, today was a much better day. The sun was shining, the woodpecker was pecking, the birds were singing and the trail was soft and level. It started with a great 5 mile walk through farmlands, then a stop at the oldest oak tree in the trail. It is enormous. Breakfast at the top of a stiff little climb,followed by a ridge walk with amazing views. After lunch we climbed up to Audie Murphy memorial. He was a second world war hero who was awarded the purple cross for bravery 3 times. He died in a plane accident on the mountain. 
It was 4 pm and we had a 4 mile down hike to the campsite. I put some music on and with Queen, Plain White T's and other songs I ran down the mountain. Dandelion and the rest followed behind. A river runs along next to the camp site, once the tent was up it was time for an amazing swim, clothes and all. A great way to cool down at the end of the day. 
My watch stopped today. This is a real pain as the watch helps me keep track of the miles as well as helps with the mindgames of making the time pass. Example: Next snack at 11 or check your progress at 12. I feel a bit lost without it and will get a cheap watch in Dalesville on Sunday. 
We are putting in 2 big days of over 20 miles each to reach town on Saturday because there is supposed to be a big storm on the way and we can then sit out the worst of it in a nice warm hotel room.

Strange things happen on the trail. Last night Pathfinder (he sleeps in a hammock) was visited by a mouse in his sleeping bag. He says it rushed around the bag for 5 minutes before he flicked the mouse out of the bag. I am sure the mouse was just looking for a cuddle. 
Today I took a fall and twisted my ankle- again. Luckily I bought a brace before we left and today it was used. It works really well and I was able to do 12 miles without a problem. 
Our new game is called food porn and is played at lunch and supper. As we are eating our crackers or rice side, one person will start by saying I would rather be eating ..... and then another would say something else. The longer we hike, the simpler the food we crave becomes. Today my craving was for a litre of ice cold milk and an orange. Dandelion is looking at any fresh fruit she can find while J just wants ice cream. Sometimes steak comes up and KFC has been mentioned. What gets us going is AYCE ( all you can eat) and The Homeplace is on the agenda for Saturday night. Southern fried chicken by the plateful.

What a day. We were up early because we had a Whiperworl bird sing all night. It just goes ""whiperworl, whiperworl"" without stopping. You can't find the bird so it drives you crazy. 
We had two challenges today. Dragons tooth and Macafee knob. 
Dragons tooth was a 2500 foot climb that started as nice switchbacks up to the ridge and then some gentle ridge walking until we had climbed 1000 feet. Then it seemed that we had some rock scrambling to do. So we scrambled up and over rocks all the way up. Having a pack on and poles complicated the climb a bit. At the top we took the picture of the tooth and then came the real challenge. 
As many of you know, Dandelion is nervous of heights and the route down has the reputation of being dangly. We did not sit around after breakfast, we started down with Dandelion poles packed away and hands sweating. There was one section that you had to be careful but the rest was a breeze and we got down in time to go to a gas station to resupply. Dandelion was brilliant and just breezed past all the rocks and small drop offs. 
I have been craving milk so my lunch was a 2 litre bottle of milk and two thirds of a pizza. Dandelion had the rest and a large Gatorade. 
Milk does not hydrate you and so after half an hour I was hot and thirsty. Water become an issue because all I had was 750 ml and no water source for about 8 miles (3 hours) of walking up and down little bumps in the mid day heat. I was a touch grumpy. 
At the start to the climb up to Macafee there was a shelter and water. I drank 1.5 l of water and immediately started to feel better. Dandelion downed her water and the world was good again. 
Macafee knob is an iconic spot on the trail, firstly for the views but also for the picture opportunity hanging your feet over the cliff. We took the pictures and hung out for a while, taking in the view. Down 1,2 miles to the shelter and camping. 
Lots of day hikers on the trail. It is a long weekend this weekend so lots of people out and about. They smell clean and fresh. We don't stand too close. Lots of them want to talk about what we are doing and why. It is fun to stop and chat and of course take a rest on the uphills. 
A great day on the trail. 
While we were cooking a big black mouse snake came to visit. They are harmless but a snake is a snake. We will keep our tent zipped up tonight.

It was 5,30 am in the morning and Dandelion was poking me in the ribs. Town day she said. Time to get up and get moving. We wanted to be in town by 1 pm and a shower and to beat the predicted rain. We were on the trail by 6-15 am. 
The walk was amazing, starting with a gentle downhill and then a nice uphill to wake up the legs. The uphill led to a beautiful view from tinker cliffs. A view right across the valley to Macafee knob. Yes we were there on day 52.

Then down into an green valley and breakfast at the shelter. On the way out we saw a family of deer and then a long up and down along the ridge. This part went on forever. We could hear the town sounds and see the town. The trail goes to the end of the ridge past the town and then back down to the road. 
By 12.45 we had a Gatorade (large) in our hands, a good hotel room and we had beaten the rain. We are sharing the room with Pathfinder to save costs. 
We were tired after our long days and high mileage days so after a shower we lay on the bed to read and woke up 2 hours later. We were obviously exhausted. 
There was one last thing to do today. Visit The Homeplace. This is an ""all you can eat southern fried chicken and vegetables"" type of place. You eat and they just keep on bringing. A real hiker place. I think the 7 of us did it justice. Flower boy and Bojingles joined us. They are 2 days hiking behind us but the hostel they are staying at is close to The Homeplace. It was great to catch up on all the trail gossip and find out who was where. Based on this, we are doing pretty well and are ahead of most hikers who started with us. We had to clear the bones of our plates to make room for more chicken. It was delicious. I know that between myself and Dandelion we managed 10 pieces. They also bring sweet tea and lemonade. We rolled out around 7.30 pm. We were not finished yet. The road led to Macdonalds and a Mac flurry to round off the meal. 
Because we were in town bedtime was 10 pm. 
Another great day on the trail. 
We use an App called Guthook that maps the whole trail. It gives you the elevation but more importantly where the shelters, campsites and water sources are. When we left we bought all 8 maps. When we leave here we pass onto map 4. We are definitely making progress. 

There is a storm warning and flood warnings for the next 3 days. Heavy rain and thunderstorms. Tomorrow we are in town but next week we are between towns. Sounds like we are in for a wet week.

We love zero days. 
You can roll over at 6 am and sleep till 7.30 am. Then make some coffee in your room and read a book till 8.30. Wander down for breakfast and slowly start the day. That's what we did. 
Yesterday J hired a car so that we could get around town and for some shopping. 
First we had to have a strategy meeting. We needed to agree the walking plan for the next week. 130 miles in 8 days. 
Some issues to consider: 
1 A massive tropical storm moving in and dumping a lot of rain over the area. 
2 J's uncle has a cabin about 70 miles up the trail and we are all invited to spend the night. 
3 We need to resupply after 4 days. We can no longer carry enough food for a longer period. We don't have space and it is too heavy. 
4 Devils Backbone Brewery is coming up on Saturday. They allow hikers to camp in their back yard. 
5 We want to be in Waynesborough by next Tuesday.

Lots of discussion was had about long days and short days. Big miles (over 20) and small miles (under15). We decided on some big and some small days. We will keep looking at the weather and see how that goes.  
Once the strategy was agreed it was off to find new shoes for Strong, new backpack for J , new crocs and watch for me. Of course we had to have brunch at a cool brewery. Their slogan is ""Clock out tap in"". Also needed to resupply. All done by 4pm and packed away by 6pm. 

Then off to another brewery for supper. This eating thing has become an obsession. No sooner have you finished one meal and you are looking to see what next. Snacking in between meals is the done thing.
The day is over, the bag is packed and after breakfast we will walk 18 mikes to the next shelter.

The walk out of town is always a difficult one. Backpacks are heavy with food and your feet are saying we have not had enough rest. The trail today was friendly with no extreme ups or downs. Just the normal elevation.

What was challenging was the crossing of the flooded streams. 4 times we had to wade through rushing water, making sure to keep our footing. We debated removing our shoes, but they are so wet already from the trail that we just walked in. Gave them a good clean we did. 
I think you develop a different mind set out here. It is more a case of lets do this rather than lets take our shoes off, put on our crocs, cross the river, dry your feet (with your socks) and put your shoes back on. It just seems too much trouble. 
We are constantly looking for the easier way to pack, hang a bear bag, resupply. Anything to make our life easier. 
Today was Memorial Day so there were day hikers and other people out for the day. They were on the trail as well as at the road crossings. Not just any road crossing but the Blue Ridge Parkway. The road runs along the ridge with beautiful views of the valley on both sides. The trail criss crosses the road and takes us through the parking for the view sites. Passed lots of clean smelling, nicely dressed normal people. 
Today we got trail magic from one couple (a coke and a banana) and spent 10 minutes talking to a family about the hike. They were reading the information board about the trail at one of the view sites when we walked past. It was fun talking to them and answering all their questions. We were a bit impatient as we had 5 miles to go and the rain was coming. 

We made it to the shelter just as the rain started. Interestingly there were no campsites. This is unusual so there are 8 of us squeezed into a shelter for 6. The way of the trail is that we will always try and make room for another hiker, especially when it is raining and the next shelter is 7 miles away. 

J has told me that as the crow flies the distance between Springer Mountain and Kathadin is only 953 miles. The total length of the AT is 2179 miles. It just shows how the trail twists and winds along to go over every high mountain between Georgia and Maine. 
If we carry on at our current pace we will be finished at the end of August. I guess we will slow down in the whites. Our aim is to finish by the 15 September.

18 miles a day seems to be our daily walk at the moment. I think that if we can keep this up then the hike will be a great success. 

Because of the cloud cover it is humid. Very very humid. So humid you sweat when walking downhill. You are drenched with sweat when walking uphill. Sadly the majority of our walk today was uphill. 3 climbs. One to warm you up, one to get you really sweaty and then the last climb. 4500 feet that took from 1.15 pm to just before 4pm. There was sweat dripping of the sweat that was dripping off my face. My sweat cloth was so wet that it was useless. All this because the rain is coming. I am lying in my tent and it is raining outside. Hopefully it will cool us down. 
About 300 miles back we met Leaky Valve and Stringcheese. Tonight they came bounding into camp. Apparently they have been chasing us for a week because they want to hike with us. It was a great reunion and a time of catching up. 
The trail puts you under pressure in interesting ways. 
People who hike faster than you do hike past you during the day and you feel the pressure to keep up. Or you see a hiker ahead of you and you feel the need to pass them. 
The other pressure is miles. There is a lot of pressure to hike big miles every day and if you don’t then you feel you should be. This caused us problems in 2013 and 2015. This time around we have been a lot more disciplined and stuck to our planning. We walk at our pace and do the miles we are comfortable with. Being older has it’s benefits.","Bobletts Gap Shelter

The trail teaches you to embrace the suck and get on with it. It has been raining now for 4 days and everything on the trail is wet and slippery.

We embrace the suck by being glad that our tent is not leaking anymore and even when it rains at night, we are dry. 
We embrace the suck by planning to have breakfast and lunches out of the rain at the shelters and at least eat out of the rain or mist. 
We embrace the suck by having hot choccocino every day when we have finished hiking. Something to warm us up and give us a shot of sugar. 
We embrace the suck by making sure we have dry clothes to change into and our sleeping pads and sleeping bags stay dry. 
Some things we can't change, such as wet clothes and wet shoes. This is starting to become a big challenge and our feet are starting to rub raw from being wet and we are developing rashes from being in wet clothes all day. Luckily we have dry socks and anti rash cream. Our feet are our biggest concern and we will have to be careful how we manage them over the next couple of days. Wet feet with spots that have rubbed raw will not be helpful. We need to stay on top of this to make sure we don’t have to leave the trail because of it. Today we left in the rain and a gentle climb up to the top of the mountain and into mist. Then a meander alongside the blue ridge parkway (a scenic drive along a winding ridge with views to both sides) and then down to breakfast. 
On the trail anything different creates interest. Today before breakfast we passed under the guillotine (a big rock wedged above our heads with enough space to walk under it). We all took the required photograph and moved on. 
After breakfast we meandered again until we climbed High Cock Knob. We just had to have lunch up there even though there was no view and we were in the mist. 
Then a long climb down to the shelter with scattered thundershowers chasing us. Just when we though we would make it to the shelter, the heavens opened. So today we started in the rain and ended in the rain. 
Strong bought new shoes in Dalesville and we think that they are a size too small. Her feet are just full of blisters. We are all trying to help as much as possible and Dandelion has been giving much needed moral support. 
Hikers stink. Dandelion and I have been smelling ammonia which is apparently a sign of our body eating itself. We need to be eating more food. So today at the end of the hike we had a bag of instant smash with a glob of real butter and slim jim chopped in. Then a freeze dried meal for two followed by a choccocino. In between, we snacked on chips and a chocolate bar. We are going to have to up our calorie intake some more if we are to finish this. I am amazed at how much we are eating all ready and still we go to bed hungry every night. We need to work on this. 

Both of us need new shoes at Harper’s Ferry. Only 200 miles away. Will order them on the internet, but it is hard to believe that I bought a new pair in Damascus almost 400 miles ago but just 3 weeks ago. Shoes only last about 6 weeks or 500-600 miles.

Just after midnight last night, the storm hit our campsite. The heavens opened and dumped rain on us for about 45 minutes. It was loud that it felt like being inside a drum. There was water everywhere around our tent. Not So much inside our tent to start with. 
Unfortunately we had pitched in a slight dip and our tent was now in a pool of water and water was seeping in via the netting. 
When we woke up our sleeping pads were wet and the bottom of our sleeping pads were slightly damp. Considering the amount and force of the rain, we were very happy. 
7 am and we were on the trail. J's Uncle was picking us up and taking us to their cabin. The first 4 miles were day hiker heaven. Nice flat trails that were well maintained and switchbacks even up the gentle inclines. We crossed over the James river on a great foot bridge and then walked up to the first shelter, all on fantastic trail. 
After the shelter, we got back to the real AT and started the steep no switchbacks climb up a nameless mountain with no views. A bit depressing. 
We were on our way to Bluff Mountain and needed cheering up. I cranked up the music and for the next hour we sang and danced down the trail to Queen, Jethro Tull as well as lots of rock and roll. Before we knew we were at the parking lot and on our way to the cabin. The music lifted our spirits. 

Strong was really struggling today so we persuaded her to hike in her crocs. It was a bit slower but it seemed to hurt less. This afternoon we went into town and bought new shoes. Mens size 10. Lots of room for her feet to expand. Hopefully this will solve the problem. 
The rest of the afternoon was taken up resupplying in Walmart and then unpacking all that back into our bags. 

Doug and Regina have been very kind. Feeding us,doing our washing and giving us a place to shower and sleep. It is the small things in life that are worthwhile.","Matts Creek Shelter

Nb NB NB. We passed the 800 mile (1280 km ) mark today. 

Summer has arrived on the trail and this means: 
1. Lots and lots of little black flies that get into your eyes, ears and any other opening they can find. This makes climbing a big mountain a real challenge. Breathing through your mouth (gasping for breath) means you suck in a few of these flies, and cough and gasp your way up the mountain. You can wear a bug net but it is hot and gets sucked in too. It is also difficult to sit outside (they bite and yes it is sore!) and to eat takes some thought and timing. Not sure how we will solve this. 
2. It is getting hotter every day and walking in the heat of the afternoon is interesting, especially when the water sources are dry and there is no real way to cool down. It makes for dangerous dehydration situations that need to be managed. Today we ran out of water at the top of a big climb and still had 4 miles to walk to get water. It was hot and very uncomfortable. The first thing we did when we got to camp today was get water and we each drank about 1,5 litres. 
3. Everything is green and beautiful. The trees are green and the forest flowers are in full bloom. Sometimes the display stretches for miles. 
4. The afternoon thunderstorms are becoming a reality and we need to be below tree line before the storms hit us. It is also nice to have our tent set up and ready to crawl in when the rain strikes. 
5. America is on summer holiday so all the camp sites and summer stores are all open and ready for business. It makes hiking a pleasant experience. 

Today we started with a huge breakfast at J's uncle's house. There was sausage, eggs, bacon, grits, biscuits, bagels and coffee. A great way to start the day. Our bags were so heavy from the resupply as well as Doug and Regina's generosity. For the first time this hike, I struggled to close my backpack because my food bag was so full. 
Then on the trail by 10am and an amazing walk along the river, through the green forest, with the birds singing and the chipmunks shouting. It was a great morning's walk. 
Lunch at the shelter and then a 3500 foot climb to Bald Knob Mountain. These big climbs take about 2 hours to climb and they are generally quite steep. It was hot and we did not bring enough water. There was no water on the way up. It felt like our heads were boiling. 
Our new mantra is that the trail will not beat us. We will win. 
There is one last big mountain to climb on Sunday and then that should be the last of the 4000 feet mountains until we reach the whites. We are not going to miss them.

Today was our longest walk in terms of hours. We started at 7am and finished at 6.30 pm.

It took us so long because: 
1 We had to spend time at spy rock. A big rock with amazing views across the valley. To get to the top, you have to scramble up the rock anyway you can. The same when you go down. It is easy to get lost on the way down and then spend time trying to find the trail. 
2 We visited the Priest Rock and shelter. You are meant to write your confessions of what you have done wrong on the trail in the book.
3 It started to rain and poured and poured all afternoon. 
4 Coming down the Priest was one of the longest and most slippery trail we have had for a long time. Steep rocks and trail made for very slow going. It took nearly 2.5 hours to do 3 miles.
5 At the bottom of the mountain there was trail magic. Bacon and egg sandwiches with coffee. 
Today was a wet slow day and we are camped on a slope because a group of scouts are camped with us and camping space is at a premium.

It rained all night. The camp site we were on turned to mud. Everything is full of mud. Our backpacks, our tents, our dry bags are just full of mud. That does not stop thru hikers. We packed up and off we walked straight up the last 4000 foot mountain until the whites. Because it was the last mountain, they made it a good one. 
It started gently winding up and around, crossing some great waterfalls and stopping at views across the mist filled valleys. As with most climbs in Virginia, just when you think you have reached the top, the trail crosses a small ridge and finds a higher mountain. Today the mountain was higher and steeper. So up we climbed to the very top. The last but scrambling over rocks. I can tell you that rock scrambling is very tiring with a pack on your back. 
Then down to the shelter for breakfast. This 6.5 mile walk had taken us over 3 hours. We still had another 14 miles to go. 
The trail went over the Blue Ridge Parkway and then wound around next to the parkway for 5 miles. 5 miles with water streaming down across the trail. Making the rocks extra slippery. I slipped and fell, Dandelion slipped and fell and after the first 5 water crossings, nobody was having fun. 2.5 hours later we completed this stretch. This left 10 miles to go and it was 2.30 pm. 
As we walked out into the parking lot - trail magic. Pork cuts with baked potatoes and lots to drink. This was an answer to prayer. 
We were debating if we should walk on or try and get a shuttle to town and spend the night in the hostel. We were wet, cold and a little grumpy. 
Pathfinder came next, dropped his pack and declared that he was finished. He was going into town. J and Strong were 10 minutes behind and they did exactly the same thing. Finished. 
We arranged the shuttle and came into town. 
Tonight we went to Ming all you can eat chinese buffet. Every thru hiker goes there because it is so good. There we met 15. We walked a long section with him in 2013. It was great to eat all the food and catch up. 
Today did not go as planned but tonight we are warm and dry with a plan to do the last miles in the morning.

It is amazing what one day of rest can do. A day of lazing around, watching TV and of course eating. We feel strong and motivated again to go walking. The change in weather also helps. We have 7 days of sun forecast. 
This morning we started with a big breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon and biscuits. J and Strong had made a huge fruit salad that I am still nibbling on just before bedtime. 
Then it was fix and clean gear. Our gear has been wet and muddy so it was great to clean everything off, fix what needed to be fixed and generally tidy up. It is a good feeling to have a clean and dry gear. All our clothes have been washed and dried. It is almost as if we are setting out on day 1. 
We resupplied at Walmart. This was a small resupply because in the Shendoah park we can buy food at campgrounds and small diners in the park. Tomorrow we walk out with lighter packs.

The decision was made to walk a short day today and walk 20 miles tomorrow. The reasons being: 
1. A late start this morning. We had breakfast at the house and then cleaned up. The shuttle picked us up at 10am and them dropped us off at the trail by 10.40am. That is a late start for us and we wanted to start slowly to get our legs going. 
2. Pathfinder, in a moment of madness, kicked the punch bag hanging on the garage and hurt his hamstring and back. Strong is just not feeling well. Dandelion just wanted to stop. 
3. Tomorrow we sleep at a campground with a store and a shower. If we walked on today we would have missed that. 
4. If we stay at the campground, there is a roadside diner on Friday morning that makes great blackberry pancakes. 

You can see that there was some logic to our planning. 

This section of 140 miles between here and Harpers Ferry will take us past the 1000 mile mark and to the psychological half way mark at Harpers Ferry. Very exciting for us to start this as it is the last section before we start counting down to the end, even if it is still 1000 miles to go. 

We started the walk this morning in glorious sunshine and signed in to the park. We were fully expecting to see a hundred bears but nope. Not today. The trail was gentle with a few gentle ups and downs, walking through the woods. We kept looking for the bears. Perhaps tomorrow. 
Lunch was on top of Small Calf Mountain where trail angels had put tractor seats for us to sit on. 
Dandelion had made delicious turkey sandwiches with lettuce and tomato sandwiches. Lunch was good. Then a short walk down to the shelter and by 2.45pm we were all set up. 
Dandelion is currently having an afternoon nap while I write this. 

Our challenge now is to work out how to set up our tent on a tent pad where we can't use tent pegs. Z packs can send us poles but that is expensive. The other option is to carry cup hooks but screwing them in to the wood every time can also be a big job. I have also seen people just using the tent pegs on a long tent line pegged to the ground but then the tent guide ropes are really long. 
Will keep you updated with what we decide. 
I bought new shoes yesterday so today was their first day out. I was careful until the first mud splash and then the shoes were old.

The Shenedoah National Park is a gentle rolling trail with some climbs, but mostly trails for day hikers. The trails are well maintained and the climbs are gentle with switchbacks. This makes for easy walking. 
The walking was so easy that you don't concentrate on where your feet go. Today a root tripped me up and I face planted. Luckily there were no rocks but I did scrape my leg and my arm. Just a little bit of blood but no real damage done. 
We started at 6.30 am and by 3 pm we were done. 
Today's highlight was Black Rock Mountain. A mountain with a cascade of black rocks on top and down the one side. Looks like someone just dumped the rocks there. 
This included a stop for lunch at a picnic spot, table included. Almost felt like a person again sitting at a real table. Pity lunch was normal crackers and cheese with tuna. A picnic basket with chicken, salad and rolls and perhaps a chilled white wine would have been nice. Sigh. 
After lunch a quick walk to the campsite, booked our spot and then down to the camp store for colddrinks and ice cream. 
When we checked in we were told that that on the one campsite they were doing a hot dog dinner for hikers. Around 5 ish I walked down to check. Sadly the hot dogs were for a wounded warrior sponsored event. They did offer to charge our phones. That was great. 
So I walked back to the store and bought Vienna sausages and rolls and we had our own trail magic. 
The nice thing about where we are is that there are campgrounds and wayside diners everyday. Means we don’t have to carry lots of food but it is hard on the cash flow. But pancakes for breakfast vs oats and a bun or hamburgers and fries versus Knorr rice sides. 
I am happy to spend the money.

Today we passed the 900 mile mark. 1 week ago we passed the 800 mile walk and next week Thursday or Friday we will pass the 1000 mile mark. It definitely feels like we are making progress. At this rate we only have 13 weeks left. We are having so much fun that that 13 weeks sounds far too quick. 

This morning was our first wayside experience. Breakfast at the wayside was pancakes, french toast, bacon, eggs, hash browns and of course coffee. While eating, the volunteer responsible for this section of the trail sat talking to us. He has been doing this for over 30 years and knows this section of the trail and the bears very well. 
Interesting fact about bears. They mate in spring, but the embryo is only implanted in autumn if the bear has enough fat - amazing! 
This meant we only started hiking at 10.30am. Because it was only 14 miles it was not really a problem. The sun was shining and there was a gentle breeze. 
The profile is fairly gentle and we walked up and down the hills through tunnels of mountain laurel and rhododendron bushes. They are all flowering at the moment. The trail sort of follows the skyline drive and every few miles we cross the drive. The last 3 miles up to the hut was a bit of a shocker. A 900 foot climb straight up the mountain. Luckily it started to rain as we started up, cooling the world down a bit. These climbs are quite tough but we are strong and fit and take them in our stride. We don’t even have to stop and rest anymore and recovery is quick. 
The bugs are bad. Really bad. You cant sit down without them swarming all over you. They bite and tonight at supper my feet were bleeding from the bites. We spray bug spray but they find the clean bits. As we lie in our tent we can hear the constant buzz of the bugs outside. They can't get in, but we are trapped inside until the morning when we will spray ourselves and continue the fight. I fear we are going to loose this one.

Another day filled with food. 
Breakfast was at the hut, oats and and a bun with honey and peanut butter. Then a quick 11 mile walk to Lewis campground and lunch from their camp store. Not a great selection but we made do. At least the Gatorade was cold and we could buy ice cream. Then a quick 9 miles on to Big Meadows Wayside for a barrel of chicken (8 pieces plus coleslaw plus mash) and blackberry milkshakes. Not a bad day considering we are in the forest. We also stopped where we had a cell phone signal and ordered two new blow up pillows and new shoes for Dandelion. 
No day is without drama and today we walked an extra 3 miles (not counted) because we missed a turnoff. The turnoff we missed was to the Big Meadows Wayside and we ended up 1,5 miles beyond the wayside at the lodge. I asked around and found someone to take our packs and Dandelion and Strong the 1,5 miles back down the road. The men started walking. About 200 yards down the road we were picked up and dropped at the wayside. 
After eating we had to walk the 1 mile up to the campground. It is difficult to walk after such a big meal. 
Lots of extra walking that is not counted. 
There are lots of ways that we add miles: 
1: We go down blue blaze trails to shelters. 
2: We fetch water, sometimes 3 miles away. 
3: We walk around town on zero days. 
4: We walk to and from hostels and towns off the trail. 

While these miles are needed, they are not counted towards the 2190 miles of the trail.

The trail today was a mirror image. This morning we walked out of the hut and up to the tops of the mountain and then down again into the valley and then up a long fairly steep climb followed by some level walking and a stiff up to the campground. This afternoon was exactly same. 
We are camped on a slope with big vans all around us. We keep on sliding down the slope. Should be an interesting night. 

Update. I learnt last night that sleeping on your back helps when camped on a slope.","High Top Hut

We are really enjoying the waysides and making the most of being able to buy food on the trail. 
After a quick 1st breakfast we had to run 7.5 miles to get to the skyline resort by 10.30am. (They close the breakfast buffet then). Pathfinder came around the corner and ran into mother bear and two cubs. Mother bear ran up the mountain, Pathfinder retreated slowly. We were lagging behind and saw none of this. We got to the resort at 10.34am and the buffet was closed. We had to settle for service from the coffee shop. Coffee and sandwiches. We stayed for almost 2 hours. 

Just 6.5 miles in the afternoon. Strong, Pathfinder and Dandelion walked on ahead while J and I walked slowly at the back. At a picnic site, a large family was having a family get together. The girls had walked straight past them. Myself and J walked up to the group and started talking. I asked about a vending machine. Nope they said. Just as we were about to walk away one of the ladies asked if we wanted a soda. Of course we said yes. We stood around answering their questions about a thru hike and they offered us a pulled pork sandwich. Yes please. Just as we were about to leave we asked if we could take a soda for the girls. Sure, they said and please have two bags of fried chicken. They also added two slabs of chocolate for desert. A good job scrounging some extra food. 
Unfortunately the storm had moved in but who cares. Just a little but of water. 
We were treated like heroes when we got to the shelter with sodas and chicken for everybody. 
Today the trail was just the trail. Up and downs with some amazing views of the valley. 

We have decided that the foundation has been laid for a successful thru hike and agreed that our normal hiking day will be 17 or 18 miles depending on camping or shelters. At our current hiking speed we should be finished hiking by 3.30 or 4 Pm. 
This gives us time to set up our tent and rest for tomorrow’s hike. We will still hike some long days (over 20) but that should become the exception. In this way we are hoping to avoid injury and still have the energy to finish.

 Last night we slept in the shelter because of the rain. It is easier than setting up a tent but you need to sleep on the shelter floor and deal with the mice. Last night J spent the night flashing his light to chase the mice away. They could care less. They were all over our bags and us. The whole night. Nobody got much sleep but the mice had a great deal of fun. 
By 7 am we marched off up the trail aiming for a shelter 17 miles away. By 7.30am the rain and cold had settled in. The trail was mud and very very slippery. On we walked because the first goal was to reach Elk Wallow Wayside for lunch around 11 miles away. The more we walked, the colder we got. We know that you should stop and put warm dry clothes on, but it is raining so hard that those clothes get wet in seconds. So we keep our wet clothes on and keep walking. As we walk we talk about an alternative strategy for the day. 
To get to Maine, we need to walk in the rain and we don't want to go to town every time it rains. What has complicated the situation is that we have sent all our warm clothes up the trail. It is supposed to be summer. 
We arrive at the wayside around 11.30 am. Our reward: a big juicy burger and fries with coffee at the wayside. 
J is our weatherman and his forecast was more of the same for the whole day but clearing in the evening. All of us were cold and wet and Pathfinder and Strong were shivering uncontrollably. A decision was made to swap our town night tomorrow for a night in town tonight. So we arranged a shuttle and went into the town of Luray VA. 
Tonight warm and dry in a hotel room.

Miles walked 16 

We were picked up from the hotel at 7.15 am and back on the trail by 7.45am. As a group we like to be up early and put the miles in before it gets too hot. 
As a group, we have made the decision to enjoy the trail and for whatever reason we can, not to get caught up in the mileage game and compete with other hikers who do more miles a day than we do. It is so easy to want to walk big miles and chase the big mile days. It is just as easy to injure yourself that way. Our mileage per day will be in the region of 16-20 miles per day, depending on where we can find a shelter or campsite. That means we stop walking around 4pm. This gives us time to relax and for what is needed before bed. The shorter miles also mean longer, lazier lunches in the sun. Putting our feet up a bit and enjoying lunch. It also means stopping at the view points and enjoying the view. 

Dandelion is getting braver and braver. This afternoon we stopped for water and once I had filtered her water she headed on up the trail alone . I finished up and followed her. She was walking so fast I only caught her two and a half hours later when she stopped at the shelter. 
While walking alone, I saw a raccoon just sitting next to the trail. I stopped and we shared a 15 second moment before it strolled across the trail in front of me. 
Sadly we are now out of the Shenedoah Park and we did not see a bear.","Elk Wallow Wayside

Miles walked 18.2 (30.3 km) 

Everybody has a plan of how many miles they need to walk each day to get to the end by a date decided on. J has a spread sheet that gets us to Kathadin by early September. Dandelion has a plan that does the same. Today both plans came together with our 18 mile day and they both show that if we average 15 miles a day we will finish on the 6 September. J and Strong would like to finish on the 6 September, their wedding anniversary. Because of this, everyone is in high spirits. 

We started early this morning and by 10am we had done 8 miles. We stopped at John and Molly Denton shelter, one of the nicest on the trail. They even have a shower. The shelter is surrounded by grass with nice camping sites. 
Then another 6 miles up a fairly long climb to a long lazy lunch outside. Inside the shelter was a big snake curled up on the rafters. I don't mind snakes but I don’t want to share a shelter with them. The shelter was halfway up the mountain, so after filling up with water we climbed the second half. At this stage of our hike, climbing is not the challenge. The heat and lack of water is. Sometimes you feel like your head wants to explode you are so hot but you can't pour your water over your head because you need the water to drink. 
At last around 4pm we arrived at the shelter. It is fairly new and well looked after. Best of all, there is a fairly large stream running in front of the shelter. We dropped our packs, grabbed soap and clean clothes and spent 10 minutes in the cold river washing ourselves and our clothes. We feel almost new after our bath. 
Staying in the shelter tonight because we want to get an early start to tackle the roller coaster tomorrow. This is a series of 13 up and downs in a 10 mile stretch. Should be fun. Hopefully there will be some water to cool us down. 

Today, I am particularly proud of Dandelion. She persevered and smiled even though she was having a tough day. We all get those days when you question your sanity and commitment to finish. You start resenting the miles to come, the climbs and the mud and the rocks and of course the heat. You start thinking of home and all the comforts. Then you have to push that all aside and just keep walking and focus on the goal. Dandelion did that today and was still smiling. 
2 more days to Harpers ferry, the half way mark.

What an amazing day. Where to start? 
Left the shelter at 6.30am. It was a glorious morning. The sun shining down through the trees. The birds singing and a gentle breeze to keep us cool. The trail was soft and gentle and even went through the Sky Meadows State Park. Rolling grasslands with open vista down to the valley. Then we had trail magic. A cooler full of Gatorade. 
By 10 am we had done 8 miles and we stopped at a shelter for water and a 15 minute break before we got to the roller coaster. 
The roller coaster is a 13 mile stretch of trail that climbs up and over 14 peaks that range from small, short, sharp climbs to long rocky climbs that go straight up the mountain. We eagerly climbed the first mountain, put our hands in the air and went down the other side. Mountain 2 was longer and steeper and not nearly as much fun. By mountain 3 we were not nearly as cheerful. Then as we crossed the road, Lavender and Count were there with trail magic. Hot dogs, watermelon and of course cold drinks. 
With new energy we climbed up to Buzzard Rock Peak and down the other side to the 1000 mile mark. 
A great celebration and a prayer of thanks that we have made it this far. Just as we took the group photo a deer came past. A great omen. 

With 4 miles to go to Bear Den Hostel, we set off with high spirits. The trail had other ideas and we huffed and puffed up the last three mountains. We had to work hard uphill and downhill was rocky and muddy. It took us over 2 hours to get to Bears Den. Our feet were bruised and battered but after a good nights sleep all will be well. 
What a pleasure. For $46 we can camp, get two showers, two pizzas, two 1-pint Ben and Jerry ice creams and pancakes for breakfast. We have also bought an extra pizza for lunch tomorrow. 
A great day on the trail.

This morning started with pancakes at the hostel and easy walk down to a highway that needed to be crossed. This is one of those crazy situations that the trail crosses the highway and you have to get across by dodging the cars. It is scary and not much fun as the cars don't slow down and there are no signs warning them that hikers are crossing. Safely across, it was an easy 8 mile walk to Blackburn Centre to fetch a letter Amber sent. 

The center is 0.3 miles off the trail, down a steep incline. Sadly there was no letter for us and the caretaker was not in the mood to be kind. So no letter and we had to ask nicely for a soda which we donated money for. Not a good experience. 
Then a quick 3 mile walk to the David Lesser shelter for a 1,5 hour lunch and stocking up on water for our camp site tonight. Just as we were leaving, a hiker arrived and told us about trail magic 3 miles down. We sent Pathfinder ( our fast hiker) to go ahead and tell the trail angels we coming. The rest of us hurried off down the trail. 
Across another busy road and there it was. A grill with hamburgers and a cooler full of soda and beer. While the burgers were cooking another ex Thruhiker arrived with chic fillet burgers and a watermelon. 
We stopped for an hour. 
Then an easy 2 mile hike to our campsite, talking to Pathfinder about his future.

Miles walked 17.5 

It was hard to leave town today. 
1. There is no water on the trail so we had to carry enough for the first 5 hours of walking. This adds 4 pounds to our bag. 
2. We are walking in a heatwave so even early in the day we are sweating and panting. 
3. We have food for 4 days and that adds 10 pounds to our bag. 
4. We all had town legs and they just did not want to walk. Too much lying around on hotel beds watching bad TV. 
All 5 of us had to force our legs to get going. With some persuasion from our minds, legs started working and we could climb the 1000 feet to take us up the mountain and onto the ridge. 

Breakfast was at 6.30am at the hotel. A good breakfast with lots of waffles, eggs, sausage and coffee. By 7am we are on the trail. The first 4 miles are alongside the river along the old canal tow path. It is flat and fast, a good way to start the day. 
The rest of the day is fairly flat but very hot. We are grateful that we are walking under the trees. It is still hot and with no streams to cool off in, we overheat and have to stop every hour to cool off. Drinking warm water doesn’t cool you off, it just hydrates you. We are going to have to be careful and manage our hydration carefully over the next few days of the heat wave. It is supposed to cool down on Thursday. 
By 4pm we are in camp. This camp has restrooms and a shower. First an ice cold shower with all our clothes on, then a big bottle of water with flavor and then we put up our tent. It is fantastic to have a table and a flat tent pad for the night. The simple luxuries that makes you feel human. 

J and Strong have lost the bag with their tent pegs in. Luckily they have a free standing tent. If that happened to us, it would be a disaster. It reminded us how careful we must be when we pack up. Because we worry about how much our packs weigh, we carry no spares. Everything in our bag is needed and there are no duplicates. A good reminder to be careful.

Summer has arrived and all the families are out walking and camping in the woods. It is great to be camping and see all the people out enjoying the woods. Tonight we have a group of girls on a hiking camp and at least 5 families camped at the shelter. 

We started early today and hoped to get the majority of miles walked before it gets hot. By 10am we had done 8 miles and then the rest of the day is a doddle. 
Some days you wake up and your first thought is ""I don’t want to do this"". I don’t want to walk. I just want to go home. Today was one of those days when you just start walking and don't think. Once you get going then you can keep going. 

We thought it would be a doddle. Maryland had other ideas. They decided that the trail needed to be full of rocks, just to break up the monotony of nice and smooth. Then lets throw in some steep but short climbs to keep them sweating. Lastly, we will make sure the water source is far away from the shelter and of course downhill.

Miles walked. 19.8 

When you hike the trail, it is the small things that keep you going forward, despite the conditions. 
Today the legs were tired and the trail was rocky. We struggled for the first hour to get going. The trail was badly marked and frustratingly challenging as we clambered up and over rocks. None of this bothered us because we we were headed for Penmar State Park for colddrinks and snacks. 
When we got there, the vending machines had been taken away. 
No sodas no snacks. We were very disappointed. 

On a brighter note we passed into Pennsylvania today. State no 6. The trail is 296 miles long through this state and should take us just under 3 weeks. The challenge is the rocks. Pennsylvania is famous for its rocks. Not just small rocks but miles and miles of rocks. Shoes come here to die. 

The rest of today's hike was normal. Long stretches of good trail with a few rocks just for fun. Lunch was at a great picnic spot. Today we had crackers with cheese and slim jims. We are walking fast enough to take a 1 hour break and still finish around 4pm. 
The tough part today was the 1200 foot climb straight after lunch. That was challenging because the first 500 feet or so was like climbing steps. Not that much fun with a backpack on. We reached the shelter around 4pm and then had to walk another mile to get to the water. One day there will be running water in the shelters ( big sigh). 
I have downloaded the last few episodes of The Big Bang Theory and so we have been watching them at night. Nice to have a little bit of normal out here.

We also ordered a take away cheese burger each for lunch. Really good. 

For the first time this hike, we spoke about home. What we are going to do when we get home. 
Paint the house 
Hang new curtains 
Buy a new car. 

At lunch it was decided that we would walk a long day so that J, Pathfinder and I could do the half gallon (2.3 liter) ice cream challenge. The challenge is to finish the ice cream in 30 minutes. The prize: bragging rights to say you did it. 
Eating so much ice cream was not easy. A good steady feed while making sure you took from the outside where the ice cream was soft, helped. Drinking just a little bit of water also helped. I felt the pressure as I had been talking up the challenge all week. I was sure I could do it but towards the end the scoops were getting slower and slower and smaller and smaller. It was good to put the last spoonful into my mouth at 28 minutes and 16 seconds. Yeah! 
We all managed to finish within the 30 minutes. No sweat, but no supper either. I am a bit hungry as I write this.

After yesterday we decided that today was going to be an easy day. 

I am pleased to say that there were no consequences to consuming all that ice cream. I am feeling good. 
By 7am we were packed and on our way. 7 miles in was Green Mountain Deli. I know we are meant to be walking, but this was too good an opportunity to miss. They are just 0.2 miles off the trail and make amazing sandwiches. We also only have 15 miles for the day. After a great brunch, 2 liters of chocolate milk and lots of coffee (1.5 hours later) we moved on. Just 7.9 miles to go. 
We all plugged in our earphones ( listening to audio books) and set our eyes on the shelter. 
The first 2 miles was a breeze. Easy trail and gentle climbs then we crossed the road. 

Note to trail maker. It is great that you found a cliff that is 20 stories high and that you could build 45 cm high steps up the side of the mountain. For a day hiker with a small pack, that can be fun. For a hiker with a 30 pound pack on our backs, climbing 20 stories of steps- not so much fun. Then to lead us through the rock maze -a great idea but please mark the trail. 
This 2 mile of maze and uphill climbing and scrambling is hard on the legs and drains you of energy. 
We did it. We climbed the steps, we solved the maze (by luck) and walked up and down the next two mountains to get to the shelter before the rain starts. We are becoming thru hikers. We are going to finish this trail. 

We are sharing the shelter tonight with a hiker who is writing a book on the history of the trail. It was interesting to hear the statistics about the trail and how the trail has changed over the years. It has got longer and the number of hikers has increased dramatically. This year, over 4000 people registered to thru hike. They expect only around 500 to finish.

Three days in a row we have found a place to buy food. This morning, it was a small coffee shop in Boiling Springs. A 4 mile walk from the shelter and we were seated with eager faces waiting for the pancakes and bacon. Hopefully tomorrow we will make 4 in a row. 
We left the coffee shop and straight to the outfitter. New socks for me and a new t shirt for Dandelion. 
As we left town the rain started. I like the rain except it turns the whole trail to mud. Sticky, slippery, go everywhere mud. You cannot walk fast in this mud. The trail was flat, winding through farm lands and fields for 13 miles. Very pretty but a little wet and full of mud. I guess we are never satisfied as hikers. 
As I write this blog, I am looking at my food bag. It has been 7 days since we did a good resupply. The stores we went to did not do resupply. Even though we have eaten out, my food bag is nearly empty. One supper of mash and a chicken rice side plus 3 crackers and one stick of slim jim dried meat. Good planning because tomorrow we go into town for resupply. 

This trail puts together the most amazing people. Some people are really cool while others are just plain annoying. 
Last night everyone had settled down in the shelter (around 8pm) when 2 hikers came in. Wet and loud. We all made space and settled down again (8pm is hikers goodnight) then they proceed to cook and talk and watch a show on their phones. It seems that to tell people not to do stuff is not done. So everyone grits their teeth and tries to sleep. We got our revenge by waking up at 5.45am and packing up to loud sighs from the couple. 
Now there is a loudmouth, know it all who just talks and talks, swears and knows everything about everything. It is really irritating. After a long days' hike you look forward to good conversation and a bit of peace and quiet.","Alec Kennedy Shelter

The walk to town was a slow walk but we still made town by 12pm. You walk straight into the town via a path down the mountain. Near the bottom the path splits and the normal people foot path keeps on going down the mountain. The AT goes up again over a 150 foot bump to arrive at a parking area 50 feet further down. (Sometimes I have no idea why they do that). Then into town and down the Main street to the Doyle hotel. 
The Doyle is famous on the AT for its beer on tap and good food. Sadly it's rooms have not been maintained. We stopped for lunch. A couple of beers and burgers and to wait for J’s uncle to pick us up and take us to a house we had rented. We plan on spending 3 nights here with tomorrow being a zero day and Tuesday a slack pack of 18 miles. 

While we waited, we spoke to the other hikers in the bar. Hikers can be a noisy lot. 

The rest of today was spent washing, cleaning and catching an afternoon nap and shopping for the next few days. 
My sleeping pad is leaking but very slowly. The problem is I can't find the leak. So I need to decide to buy a new pad ($150) or think of another way to find the leak. Water in the bath did not work. 
In other news we heard that Angie (Dandelion's best friend) is coming to join us later in our hike. We are trying to surprise Dandelion on the trail for her birthday. (19 July) Will see what I can work out with Angie in the next while.

Bill and Mary-lee (J’s uncle and aunt) have been great. Driving us around to resupply and to the outfitters and to drop Dandelion and I off at the movies. We saw the book club. A movie about older woman looking for intimacy. A funny movie that allowed us to buy a large popcorn and large diet coke. That was lunch. 
Tonight a good diner of lasagna and salad and early to bed. 
We have rested today and are ready for the next section to Delaware water gap and the end of Pennsylvania.

Slack packed south today. We were on the trail by 7am (thanks Bill). It seems that slack packing means that the boys carry the packs and the girls dance down the trail. That's what happened today. We love this because we can walk fast and get the miles done. Pathfinder has hurt his back and did not join us today. It was strange only having 4 of us. Tomorrow he will start one day behind us and catch up because he walks faster than us. 

We thought that the trail was quiet. Walking north you move in sync with other hikers and sometimes don't see anybody because you are all walking the same speed. Walking south you pass all the northbound hikers and realize how busy the trail is. We passed over 20 hikers. Lots of them people we knew. Tomorrow we will be hiking with them again. 
Then we saw the bears. First I saw what looked like a large dog running across the trail. It was a teenage bear followed by another bear. The second bear stopped looked at me and walked down the trail and then sauntered off into the forest. Talk about being ignored. 

Lunch was chicken mayonnaise sandwich at the shelter and then down into Duncannon for a chocolate milkshake before being picked up by Bill and taken home for a shower. Bill and Mary Lee made supper for us. Chicken and steak and baked potatoes. 
I just love zero days and slack packing.

Leaving the house this morning was hard. We had spent three nights there and it had sort of become home. We knew where everything is and the fridge was still full of our stuff. By 7.30am we had everything ready to go. Pathfinder off to the Doyle to start one day behind us and hopefully catch us soon. The rest of us back to the road crossing to continue walking North. Thank you Bill and Mary Lee for being so kind. 

A day of two halves. The morning was great. The trail started on a gentle 1000 foot climb and then wound its way gently through the forest on fairly level, soft trail with a few rocks here and there to make it interesting. We saw a white tailed deer with her fawn just off the trail. The sun was not shining but it was cool out - just right for walking. 
We stopped for lunch at the shelter and after lunch everything changed. 
We walked down a road for 100 yards turned back into the forest and the green was replaced with swamp and green slime. At one stage the trail was under 1 foot of water for 50 yards, with no way around it. We had no choice but to splash straight through . Bye dry socks, bye dry shoes. It was not fun and we sort of left that piece of the trail feeling grumpy. 
Then up a climb that was nasty, down a nasty incline, all the time walking through a forest that was burnt and gnarly. Of course it started to rain. 
We were aiming for this campsite but it has no water so J and I filled up at the bottom of the mountain and carried up an additional 4 liters of water. Each liter weighs 1 kg and we have an out of town pack full of food. Luckily it was less than a mile. 
We set up camp with the threat of rain but managed to cook and hang the bear bags before the rain started. 
The wood thrush is singing and the fireflies are out. Now that it is not raining it is fantastic to be camped in the forest.","Clark Mountain Road

Last night was an adventure. We were camped on top of a mountain at around 2000 feet. When we went to bed the sky was overcast but no rain was predicted. Around 12am the thunder and lightning started. It was all around us. We were in the middle of an electric storm. There was so much static that there were sparks between my hiking pokes keeping the tent up. Then the rain came. In buckets and buckets. I could hear the water running under the tent. The rain was coming in side ways and blowing in under the vestibule and wetting our sleeping bags. It was a long night. By 4 am the worst was over and we finally fell asleep. 

By 7am we had dried up as best we could, packed our bags and moved on..... straight into a river which is the trail. Our nice dry socks are now soaking wet. Nothing else to do except walk straight on. Then the river we crossed had flooded its banks and we had to wade thigh deep through the swollen river for 500 yards. That sort of set the pattern for the rest of the day. The trail was wet and muddy. 
Oh yes, we are in Pennsylvania so there are rocks everywhere and when wet, slippery. 

This morning while we were packing up we mentioned a hostel, but that would mean hiking 21 miles. J booked the hostel and that meant a long hike. Dandelion put her head down and off we went. By 4pm we were done. 
The last three miles of the trail was a river, calf deep. Very frustrating when you want to get the day done. 
One positive is the sun will be shining in the morning 
The hostel is amazing. $40 gets you a bed, hot shower, diner and breakfast. 

Today we passed a land mark. We have less than 1000 miles to go. The countdown has started.

It seems we have decided to glamp the trail. Last night we stayed at a hostel to dry out. Tonight we are staying at the Port Clinton hotel. Not as grand as it sounds. It has been a long time since I shared a bathroom with the other 10 rooms. One of the best showers I have had on the trail. The beds are soft and we are sleeping inside again tonight. Not sure why I am carrying a tent (ha ha). The supper tonight at the hotel was really good. 

I managed to get to Cabela (large outdoor store) today and bought a new sleeping pad. I am a bit sad because I liked my Klymit pad. Unfortunately it has a slow leak which means that I wake up on the ground in the middle of the night. The selection was not good and I ended up buying the Neo air. Very expensive but no other choice. 
I am so tired of protein bars so I am trying to make my own trail snack. My first attempt was not good. Too much sugar. I was up and down the whole day. So I bought some nuts and mixed those in. Hopefully the extra nuts will balance out the sugar. We will see. 
The trail today was great. Long stretches of flat trail with some rocks in between and occasionally 100 feet of rock scrambling. The climb down to Port Clinton was very steep, with lots of loose rocks. A bit unstable. I was very pleased we were going down, because up would have been really hard. 
Tomorrow we start the last section to leave Pennsylvania by Thursday next week.","PA Route 183

Today the trail was brutal. We started with a 1000 foot climb that was steep. Calf burning steep. (Even my calves). 
We knew it was going to be hot (100 degrees f) so we started early. 
That was followed by rocks and more rocks. Rocks suck. You need so much energy to pick your foot up, heave your body and pack up, find a place to put your other foot, then heave yourself onto the next rock. It makes you feel like you are climbing steps. This was happening all morning. 
Then we had a 500 foot climb up a rock fall. By 11am we were tired. Very tired. 
It was also very hot. 
We did get to the top and saw the pinnacle. A pile of rocks that looked like it was man made and where rocks go to die. 
By 3pm we had reached the shelter. It is more like a manicured lawn where we are camping. 
At last we have other hikers around us. For the last few days it has just been the 4 of us. We are still waiting for Pathfinder to catch up. 
I did try to write the blog this afternoon but somehow my eyes closed and I ended up drooling on my pillow for an hour. 
At last it is cooling down. Still hot but bearable. Tomorrow promises to be a little warmer.

38 degrees is hot. When it is 38 degrees and humid and feels like 40 then walking 30 km with a backpack. Add some rocks in the trail and then some rock climbs called Bens Outlook, then over bear rocks and then the big one. The knife edge. 150 yards climbing on big rocks, in the full sunlight , balancing on the edges of rocks all the time looking to make sure you don’t step on a rattle snake (we did not see a snake but lots of people do) and keeping Dandelion focused on where to put her feet and not look at the drop off. To finish the day we climbed Bake Oven Knob. A jumble of rocks 100 feet up and 150 down and then a rock scramble down to the shelter. 
Oh yes, then make sure all the water sources are dry. That was our challenge today. 
We had walked for 6 hours and water was low. Both Dandelion and I needed water. We asked for prayer from our church family and 1 mile later we stopped for lunch. Blue blazes lead to water. I grabbed my bottle and 300 yards down was clear cold water. God cares for His children. Then at the road crossing about a mile later someone had left water for thru hikers. Warm but water is water. 
Tonight we needed a lot of water and of course the water source had three possibilities:

1st spring dry. 
2nd spring dry 300 yards down.

3 spring 0.5 of a mile down the mountain. So down the mountain we went and collected 10 litres of water. 
We are making sure that we have enough water.

Pennsylvania is a challenging state. Rocks, heat, steep climbs and no water. We are entering a 8 mile stretch with just one water source at the next shelter and then 13 miles on the ridge top with no water. And it is 100 degrees. 
We decided to beat the heat and walk early. 5.30am we were packed up and out of the shelter. At 8am we had walked 8 miles and started our descent down to the river and the climb up Leigh High Gap. 
Leigh Gap is a 1000 foot climb and is one of the talked about challenges on the trail. The first 500 feet is a steep, straight up trail that leads to the base of the rocks. That is where the fun and the challenge starts. Straight up rock climbing and scrambling. 
We thought we had beaten the heat but we were wrong. It was steep. It was hot and it was long. My shorts and top looked like I had just climbed out of the pool. At last we reached the top and started walking along the ridge. 
The ridge was once barren because of mining but they have restored a great deal of the land. The trees are back, the flowers are back and even the black and blueberries. 
It was a long walk under the sun and by 12.30pm we had all had enough. Luckily Little Gap was just ahead. 
We decided to hitch into a little town called Danielsville and sleep behind a deli and get something cold to drink. 
We stuck out our thumbs and the girls got a quick lift into town. The guys were not so lucky. But the lady who gave the girls a lift came back up the mountain (about 2 miles) to come and fetch us. Awesome people. 
At the store we got Gatorade, chocolate milk and lunch and then up to the pavilion. 
On the way in, J saw a sign for a bed and breakfast place. Off he marched to check this out and came back 10 minutes later very excited. They had 2 rooms with showers and air conditioners. They also did all our washing.

It took us 1 minute to say yes and check in. 
We are back to glamping the trail. Perhaps that will be the title of our book. Tomorrow we camp and hopefully by Wednesday the heat wave has broken and we can go back to walking 18 mile days.

Happy 4th of July to all our American friends. Yesterday we watched all the preparations being made for the big day today. Some towns were having parades and celebrations. Almost every town has a fire works display. A lot of the houses are decorated with 4th of July decorations that includes a flag. It is good to see so many people proud of their country and celebrating. 
At 7am Barbara dropped us back on the trail and immediately we start climbing rocks. We are all so sick of Pennsylvania and the rocks. Our feet are sore from constantly stepping onto or over these rocks. Enough now. Tomorrow will be our last day in this state. 
Hopefully things will get better when we get to New Jersey. Everyone is feeling down. The motivation is low. Now is the time for us to just keep going. 

We stopped a bit earlier today because of the rocks but also because of the storm. 
There is thunder and lightning all around but no rain yet. A little bit of rain to cool the world down a bit would be nice. And the rain came down and cooled us all off. 
We spent most of the afternoon in our tents while it rained outside. Today I don’t mind having to pack up a wet tent. 

I even managed to have an afternoon nap. I am enjoying my new sleeping pad. It is a step up from my old one on the comfort stakes. 

Last night was a long night. I ate half a big pizza and some ice cream. My stomach was unhappy all night. I almost stayed another day, but decided that it was not that painful and moved on. It seems that while on the trail things take chances to hurt. So today, it was my stomach and under my right foot.","Little Gap

I woke up this morning feeling grim. I had that kicked in the stomach feeling and a roaring headache. Not feeling like walking at all. Dandelion was fussing about what we both did not say - lime disease. 
We packed up and started walking. Today was the last time we would walk in Pennsylvania. 
This has been a very difficult state. Both physically and mentally tough. Not exactly sure why but it could be the heat, the rocks, the scarcity of water or a combination of them all. All of us are feeling a little battered and bruised and ready for New Jersey. 
The trail today was rocky and flat, but walkable. The only challenge was the walk out of the wind gap. A straight up scramble to get onto the ridge. A rude good morning for the legs. 
At tea time, I drank some coffee and my head ache went away. I admit I am addicted to caffeine. As I ate small bits, my stomach started to feel better and my energy levels returned. Must be the attraction of town. Not sure what the problem was but it seems to have gone away. 
The closer we got to town, the nicer the trail became and then the trail makers decided it was too easy for the AT. So off we go down a steep rocky climb down for about 2 miles only to join the smooth trail again. Then when we get to the bottom, the AT has to go up and over a 100 foot climb. Both the nice trail and the AT end at the same parking lot. Just because they can. 

We are staying at a reasonable hotel downtown. The Presbyterian church feeds hikers on a Thursday night. We won't miss free food. So we walk the mile across town to go to supper. It was worth it. A good spread and ice cream. 
We have joined up with Pathfinder again. He was waiting for us at the hiker feed. The trail family is together again.

We were so looking forward to this day. The day we walked across the bridge and into New Jersey. This morning we did that. 
Very early this morning we were up and hiking. 
The walk across the bridge was scary. Big trucks speeding past just feet from your shoulder. You shook every time the trucks came past. It was great to be back into the forest and climbing up Sunfish Pond. This was where we started in 2015. Today we realized how fit we now are as we sailed up the mountain that had us huffing and puffing in 2015. 
Sunfish Pond is pretty but no swimming, so off we hiked. 
The trail is lined with blueberries and so we stop every so often to pick a few or grab a few on the way. I decided to pick a few and put them in my water bottle. Blueberry infused water. 
12 miles in, we walked into the Mohican Outdoor Centre for milkshakes and ice cold Gatorade. An hour later we dragged ourselves from the store. 
Lunch was an hour later under a fire tower with a real picnic table. We were starting to feel like humans. 
The whole day today was overcast and hot and humid. So we hiked down to Crater Lake for a swim and cool off. That was fantastic, feeling the water around you and taking the opportunity to cool down. We were given a whole container of watermelon as trail magic. Unfortunately there is a big no camping sign next to the lake. 
We have walked 300 feet down the road and found a flat spot for our tent. 
A great first day in New Jersey.

We stealth camped last night just a short distance away from Crater Lake. Around 2am, we heard snorting and huffing and puffing. It was on the path and Pathfinder had hung his hammock across the path. It turned out to be a deer ram that was seriously unhappy that we were camped in its path to the water. It puffed and huffed and then crashed away through the bush. 
We promised ourselves that we would leave later this morning because the restaurant we were aiming for for brunch only opened at 11am. By 7am we were walking. 
We stopped in at the first shelter to fetch water. The mosquitoes carried us away. After fetching water my arm was bleeding from the mosquito bites. They totally ignored the spray. 
By 11am we were seated next to the lake, something cold in our hand and burgers and sweet potatoe fry and salad. A great start to the day. 
Then a rocky afternoon hike that took forever. It went on and on and it was hot and dry. Dandelion was getting grumpy and then we passed a group of children out for a hike. The first thing the first child said is that there is a lot of food at the next shelter. The shelter was just a mile away. We dropped our bags at the shelter and followed the signs and went down to the road.

At the trail magic yesterday, we were told that they would be serving breakfast at 8am. Today was a slow start. Wake up. Read a bit. Lazily pack and get down to the road around 8.05 am and then sit on chairs and drink coffee from a plunger and eat cold watermelon. They also had egg and bacon buns. 
That took an hour so we only started walking at 9am. 
New Jersey is reasonably flat but the trail designers still found some 200-300 foot climbs for us to sweat up. Luckily there were views to be seen. 
Around 11am we arrived at High State Park and there Iron Man ( thru hiker of 2016) was making pancakes . How can you say no to a banana, blueberry, chocolate chip pancake. They were so good I had 2. 
With just 9 miles left, we marched on at 12 noon. Dandelion and the rest in front and me at the back. I stopped for a toilet stop and to put my audio book on. When I looked up they were all gone. 
No problem, I just walked on until I came to an opening in the hedge I was walking along and disturbed a nest of wasps. I stepped back and waited for them to settle down. 5 minutes later, I ran through and got stung once on my arm. That really hurt. I poured water on it to take the sting out. 
5 miles to go in the middle of the afternoon with no water was not going to be fun. Every water source I passed was dry or stagnant. 3 miles ( 1,5 hours) later a small sign saying water 100 yards off the trail. Cold water straight from the mountain. 
Pennsylvania was dry and New Jersey is not much better. Water is a big challenge for us. There are trail angels that drop 5 gallon containers at road crossings. We don’t rely on the water but it does make it a lot easier. 
We have sort of become part of a larger trail family that is hiking the same miles and a similar pace. Lots of social and lots of laughs.","Mashipicon Shelter

We started the day early because as the sun went down last night, the bug orange lights came on in the park we were camping in. It shone all night, right into our tent. I eventually put a buff over my eyes but that did not help much. 
By 5.30am we were up. 
By 6am we were in front of the general dealer buying a cup of coffee. What luxury to have coffee early in the morning. 
The trail today was typical AT In Jersey. Up and down over small hills and over big rocks. Then they throw in some 800 foot rock climbs. 
The most famous is Stairway To Heaven. Yes, 800 feet of stairs going up a rock face. It would not have been that bad had we not stopped for a pint of ice cream and 500 ml of iced tea. That made the climb a little challenging. 
At 3pm we made the decision on to camp at Surprise Lake. The side trail was a mile off the trail. But it was worth it. 
We arrived around 5 pm and went straight into the water. Cold and refreshing. It also gave us a chance to wash off the dirt and sweat of the day. We are camped next to the lake and I am lying in my tent watching the sun go down. Beautiful.

Today was a short day. A day to rest and recover from the last week of hiking. In the last week, we have hiked 115 miles. 
Drama last night. We camped at Surprise Lake and as usual by 8.30pm we were asleep. At 11pm,  I woke up to the roaring of engines and bright lights on my tent. My first thought there was a road near by or that someone was driving up the trail on quad bikes. J screamed at them and told them we were camping here and they must switch off their lights. This they did. I then got up to see what was happening. I found two old jeeps with 6 people who had driven up the hiking trail to the lake. They were now stuck and needed a place to turn around. With lots of revving and maneuvering, they managed to get turned around and crashed back down the trail, breaking trees and wrecking vegetation. When I asked why the drove up a hiking trail, they answered that is what we do in New Jersey. That disturbed our sleep and it took a long time to get back to sleep. 

This morning after a breakfast at the lake, we climbed the mile back to the AT and almost immediately crossed the border into New York. 
This morning was walking on the big rocks on the sun. It took us 3 hours to do 6 miles. The slowest we have walked for a while, even though we knew that there was ice cream and chocolate milkshakes for lunch. 
Then a short 4 mile walk to the campsite and a chance to rest for the afternoon. 
Our biggest challenge at the moment is water. The water sources are either dry or stagnant pools. That means they cannot be relied on. 
The decision then becomes how much water to carry. Water is heavy but we need enough to get through the day. Even the shelters have unreliable water sources. 
For the last few days, we have ended the day dehydrated and have had to drink 2 or more litres of water to quench our thirst. 
One strategy is to drink as much as we can in the morning and when we get to water sources to camel up. It works but it is not easy climbing mountains with water swooshing around in your stomach. Just another challenge until we leave New York next Wednesday. Connecticut apparently has lots of water.","Surprise Lake

You won't believe this but last night around 10.30pm, we were all asleep when I could see bright lights and heard people shouting fire department! They flashed their torches all over. They were out looking for an injured hiker. 
That is two nights In a row we gave been woken up after 10.30pm. 
Hoping for a good nights sleep tonight. 

So: 
1. Water is still a big issue and we are relying on trail angels to leave water at road crossings or by going off to trail to ice cream shops or beach resorts. Even at the shelters there is no water. 
2. The trail through New York is like a roller coaster. Up and down. The ups are normally a bit of a rock climb and scramble and the downs are quite steep and loose rocks. This does not make for happy hikers. Dandelion's comment: ""If I wanted to climb rocks then I would have gone rock climbing, not hiking!"". 
3. The beach had vending machines and a water spigot. So we definitely walked the extra 0.3 mile down to the beach (it was at the lake) and made full use the vending machines for Gatorade and ice cream. 
4. Today was a day for animals. We saw a bear looking for grubs. The bear was not interested in us and just kept on scratching and sniffing. 
We saw 3 deer and one fawn. We saw a turkey. We saw a rattlesnake. 

We are camped for the night. Spirits are high because: 
A. Tomorrow is town day. 
B. Friday is a zero day. 
C. We cross the Hudson river tomorrow. 
D. We pass the 1400 mile (2324 km)mark.
E. Our food bag will be empty when we go into town in the morning.

You know that town day is very important to us hikers. Up before 5.30am and hiking by 6am. Only 16 miles to the end of this section and a zero day at Art and Annie. New York makes you work hard for any rest you may need. Today was no different. 
It started with a short 100 foot climb up a rock face and then followed that up with 6 more short steep up and downs. 
Then when your legs feel like jelly they make you climb 3 1000 foot climbs with no switch backs. 
Nothing can put us off and by 10.30am we had climbed Bear Mountain ( trail magic - Gatorade and chips - thank you Hummingbird) and were headed down to the zoo and the walk across the Hudson river. We made the mistake of thinking that we were almost there. Just 5 miles to go. 
The zoo was sad. The bridge was great. The climb up to Anthony’s nose was punishing. One of those steep climbs with at least 3 tops. Every time you think you there, you turn the corner and up you go again. This was followed by a long flat walk across the ridge. I am sure that when you want the walking to end, the trail gets longer. It took forever to finish. At last by 1.30pm we were done and buying Gatorade and steak sandwiches for lunch. 
Now the rest period began. Art and Annie fetched and fed us and made sure we had everything we needed. Thank you so much. There were also packages from back home and from Jay and Laura. Thank you all for making us feel special. 
We spent the zero day cleaning up, having haircuts and just lazing around. Just the way it should be.","William Brien Shelter

It is always hard to leave a great place and especially after a zero day. 
By 7am we were on the trail and making miles. New York lived up to its reputation. Find the rocks and send the hikers up and down the rock outcrops all morning long. This is so frustrating. It takes energy to step up and over and up and over. By noon, our legs were feeling like jelly and some people were just glum. I mean glum. 
Lunch was at Lake Canopy. A nice lake with a beach and a small shop. To get to the lake, we had to hike up a hill and over all the rocks they could find. We could hear the people having fun, but we could not get to them. It took an hour to walk around the lake. Now there were some very glum people. 
After lunch (chicken mayonnaise buns) we had five miles to get to the shelter. A quick 2 hour walk and we were there. 
There was a team doing trail maintenance and they asked for help. After 19 miles, we spent an hour moving wood and clearing up the place. As a reward we got supper tonight (chicken and pork chops with corn on the cob and strawberry cobbler for desert) and will get breakfast in the morning. A good exchange.

Last night after I had written the blog, I looked around for my charging bag. The bag has my battery backup and cables. It was nowhere to be found. Don't panic I say. But if I can't charge my phone, I cant navigate, I cant work out where we are, can't write a blog or read my book. I ask Art to check, I look around but the bag is missing. 
We walked out to a small climb and by 7.30am it was 100 degrees. I can't wait for the heat to break. We are praying for rain. 
Today was a slow day so I went down to the deli to treat myself to a coffee and donut and steal some charge by borrowing a charger. Dandelion joined me and we shared a club sandwich. 
At the back of the deli is a grass patch and a girl was doing nude meditation. She quickly got dressed but there was that oops uncomfortable feeling. 
Back on the trail, water is again a challenge. At the shelter they had a hand pump and the water was ice cold. I can't tell you how great it feels to drink 1 litre of ice cold water when you are hot and dehydrated. 
This afternoon we walked passed Nuclear Lake. Time for a swim. Jay was changing into a pair of shorts when Norvegan came walking passed and saw J nude. She turned and ran. Poor girl. 
This shelter is built on a slope so tenting sites were all slopey. I can't remember when we have slept on a level tent sites. At 10pm a hiker came in and put his tent up in the shelter, waking everyone up. J got into a little discussion with Pumpkin Spice about trail etiquette.","RPH Shelter

Because it was a big day, we were up early and eager to go. Walking past the shelter, Pumpkin Spice called to me and asked if the little orange bag was mine. My charging bag. It had fallen out at RPH Shelter and Pumpkin Spice had volunteered to carry it and he walked into the night to catch us. I was overwhelmed and gave him two of our mountain house meals (thanks Jay and Laura). 
God really does answer prayers and He shows kindness to us every day. 
With such a great start to the day we left with a bounce in our step down to the garden centre where they have a gazebo for hikers, as well as water and indoor toilets. A quick breakfast and a great morning walk through meadows and up and down gentle climbs. 
Lunch was on the banks of the 10 mile river. It was boiling and we put our feet in the water to cool off. 
After lunch the trail became a monster. Three big climbs in the afternoon and no water made all of us hot and grumpy. 4 hours later we came across our first water source. Chugging a litre of water each and carrying 2 liters each to the shelter. 
I have never seen so many mosquitoes in one place. They don't care about spray or clothing. It was eat and dive into our tents. Inside the tent it was boiling, outside the tent mosquitoes ruled. 
When it is so hot the tent becomes very small and we have to be extra polite to one another.","Telephone Pioneer Shelter

The mosquitoes won. This morning out of our tent and on our way before we were truly eaten. 
We were walking out to be picked up by J’s cousin and taken to their lake house for the next three days. One day of slack packing and two days of rest. 
We need the rest to prepare for the next 700 miles. 
As always our first hour and a half was a big climb and then up and down until we reached Caleb Mountain. What a pain. Hot and straight up. At the next level spot I took my clothes off and wrung them dry. They were dripping wet. To add to my challenge, the wet clothes are causing heat rashes in all the uncomfortable places. 

We climbed down a great rock cliff with steps and hand holds. Dandelion just climbed on down and off we went. 
The trail ran alongside a big river for 4 miles. 4 miles of flat trail. A gift. 
After every flat comes the climb. 
And up we went. The clouds were building and the thunder was thundering. As we walked it got darker and darker. The thunder got louder and the rain started sprinkling. 
Then I heard the sound of a waterfall and an approaching train. 
The cloudburst caught us. The rain came bucketing down. What a relief after all the heat. The rain was cold and refreshing. Nobody stopped to put on rain gear. We all rejoiced in the rain. 
Jody, J’s cousin was there to meet us as we came out of the forest, dripping wet and took us to her cottage on the lake for a great meal and a shower.

The slackpack was really good. Started at 8am and we were done by 2pm. I like that as a hiking day. 

Dandelion fell yesterday and this morning her whole leg is swollen and has little blisters on them. She decided that she did not want to walk with us. That made the surprise a little difficult because Angie wanted to walk down the trail and surprise her. In the end, Jody and Dandelion collected Angie and spent the morning together. 
We are spending 2 days at this house just resting and catching up. 
All of us are feeling tired and in need of a good break from the trail. I think the tiredness is mostly mentally. We are discovering that it takes quite a bit of determination to walk 18 or 20 miles a day. 
We are also all sort of carrying painful body parts from day to day. The feet hurt a bit more or a rash develops or your shoes wear thin and scrape your heel. Nothing serious but it all slowly starts to wear you down. 
The biggest challenge is coping with the same routine day after day. The mountains change and the weather changes but the trail remains. 
We are listening to stories and music and keeping our minds active with lots of talk and jokes. 
The other challenge is our gear. Shoes are starting to wear thin and finding outfitters and towns to go onto is getting a little more difficult. 
We are also discovering that New England is pretty expensive compared to the south. 
The trail is challenging and that's why only 25% of people who start this - finish. 
We will finish. As of today, we only have 689 miles to go.

Today was Angie's first day on trail. We were not sure what to expect but as usual she just got on with it. 
The trail was gentle to start with but then came Bear Mountain, a nice little climb with a steep rocky descent into Sages Ravine. A pretty 1 hour walk next to the stream. 
Now the work really started and we climbed Race Mountain. A long gradual climb up to the ledges with views back to Salisbury and Twin Lakes. The views were amazing so we stopped for lunch and just enjoyed. 
J and Strong have decided that they want to walk a bit faster and they arranged for a 21 mile day, making use of Jody to fetch them from the trail head later today. Not sure if we will see them again, but we never say bye, just see you later. J and Strong stopped for lunch with us and then everybody walked on. 
Everett Mountain is a steep up all along the rocky outcrops. That was a good 1000 foot straight up climb. Then down the back, a much gentler descent. At the bottom, just before the shelter Dottie was handing out water. Just what we needed. 
It seems we are alone at the shelter tonight. Rain is expected so we are all snug and warm in our tents. But the mosquitoes are keeping us captive.

We woke up this morning to a wet tent. There is something great about lying in your tent when it is raining outside. You feel warm and snug in your sleeping bag, but there is nothing as painful as packing up a wet tent and putting it in your backpack. But what choice did we have. 
We always have choices and today Jess Treats was one of our choices. Just 8 miles down the trail: 
1. We could dry out and take a shower. 
2. We could go into a town and buy shoes for Angie. Her shoes were hurting her when she went downhill and this is the last town for the next 120 miles with an outfitter. We went and got a very nice pair of Merryl’s. They will last to the end. 
3. There was also an opportunity for a chocolate milkshake. Mmmm. 
4. There is always an opportunity to slack pack and pick up the miles. Watch this space. I think a good long slack pack may be possible tomorrow. 
5. This is a place to reset your head. Dandelion is struggling with the repetition of the trail and also the harshness of chasing miles to get finished. Hopefully this will make the next section easier. 
6. I had some work to do so it worked out very well. 

By 7.30am we were walking in the rain. A light drizzle that was cold enough to keep our rain jackets on and the climbs big enough to make sure that we were hot and sweaty under the rain jacket. Sometimes you just can’t win. By 9am we were descending Jughead. Slabs of steep rock that you needed to walk down on. Today they were wet and slippery and so we needed to be careful. A couple of slips but no falls. The frustrating thing is they take time and energy to navigate. 
Then through the valley of the swamp of mosquitoes. Bug spray on - they don't care. They get in between your back and your backpack and they bite. Then they invite their friends and family over to join in the feast. Yes it is very sore. We half walked half ran the 2.5 miles through this swamp. All of us got badly bitten. Oh well, at least the mosquitoes got fed. 

The trail seems full of day and section hikers. Not many thru hikers. Last night at the shelter there was one other thru hiker and 4 section hikers. Not sure what this means but we rarely see thru hikers on the trail anymore. I know they are there but where? 
At Jess Treats, a hiker is recovering. Hurt his knee very badly by doing big miles every day through New York and Connecticut. We must learn that lesson. If we do between 15 and 18 miles a day we will finish the middle of September. We must remember to keep going at a moderate pace and not be caught up in the race to the end. We must stay in the slow lane and visit all the good places - just as we have been doing. If we do this, we will give ourselves the best opportunity to not pick up an injury. 

Angie's first day was a bit of an eye opener. I don't think she realized how quickly we walk and how efficient we have become at packing up and moving on. We are going to slow down a bit and Angie will speed up. We have refined our plan to still get to Hanover on the 7 August. We are just doing things a bit differently. 

I realized how jaded we had become when Angie was taking pictures of the view of a valley full of trees. We had just walked past and looked briefly. We need to stop and appreciate the journey. 
There seems to be a theme here. Slow down have fun and enjoy the last 680 miles on the trail.","Hemlock Shelter

Yesterday we bought new shoes for Angie. Meryl hiking shoes. Today Angie slack packed 20 miles today. A good introduction to the trail. Angie sailed through the 20 miles. 
Like any 20 mile day, you are sore and tired at the end of the day. The positive of a slack pack is you come back to a great supper, a warm shower and a nice bed. 

Good news is that Dandelion’s leg is looking much better and is no longer worrying her. In fact for most of the day she was in front. Now we are waiting for the blisters to burst and the new skin to grow. Sounds charming. 

We started in a light drizzle and within 5 minutes I had fallen. I stepped onto a wooden board and down I went. I slipped and fell 4 more times today, all on very slick wet rocks. Dandelion slipped 3 times. Fortunately nobody was seriously hurt. For the rest of the day the sun was out. The last half mile rained and stormed and we got to the road cold and wet. 
The trail was gentle with two big climbs and lots of ups and downs along the ridge. There was a little bit more water today so we could fill up our water bottles regularly. 
We found all the other hikers today. We walked south and so we passed all the northbound hikers today. We saw a lot of hikers that we had hiked with or knew from shelters. It was fun catching up and swapping trail news of which hikers were where, as well as news on good towns to visit or all you can eat restaurants visited or to be visited. 
We also found out that we are about two weeks ahead of the big hiker bubble. We will have to keep hiking to stay ahead of the bubble. The bubble fills the shelters, camp sites are scarce and towns and hostels become crowded. The trail is challenging enough without having to compete for resources. 

We have a new motto for the rest of the hike:

Last night I did a quick calculation and ....... 
WE HAVE 44 DAYS LEFT ON THE TRAIL IF WE DO 16 MILES A DAY WITH 5 ZERO DAYS. The countdown has started. Our estimated finishing date is 12th September. I know that looking forward is sometimes counter productive, but for us talking about the end and starting to plan for what comes next is uplifting. 
As we walked today we spoke about climbing Kathadin and deciding how to celebrate. We will definitely fly a South African flag and choose a great piece of music. Organizing a braai at the summit could be challenge. 
Angie is settling in well and there is a lot of chit chat as we walk. It makes the day go quicker. 
We were dropped at the main road by Jess, the lady who owns Jess treats (a hiker house). What a super place. Nice beds, good breakfast and a really nice vibe. We all sat around the dining room table for supper and breakfast and shared our stories with the other hikers. 
The hike went up to the ridge and then followed the ridge line for about 4 miles, then all along Upper Goose Pond, a very pretty lake. We decided not to go to the cabin because it was 0,5 miles off the trail. We climbed Mount Becket and had lunch at the site of the old fire tower. Sadly the fire tower does not exist anymore and there were no views. The afternoon walk was an up and down affair. Small little hills between 50 and 100 feet. No big challenge but tiring. 
Our shelter tonight has bunks and a stream that is running next to the shelter. Having a stream is luxury. It has been a long time since we have had water next to the shelter. The downside are the mosquitoes. Oh well, we will have to share our water with them. 

I read a book yesterday about a couple who slack-packed the whole trail. It cost them $20000, excluding food. An easy option but way outside our budget. I am afraid we will have to carry our backpacks all the way.","Main Road

Last night a storm was predicted so we decided to sleep in the shelter. We were dry and comfy but the mosquitoes ravaged us. The storm did not arrive. It arrived just as we left the shelter this morning. The trail quickly became a river. 

The rain is a pain to walk in but the streams are flowing again and water is plentiful. The forest is green and the blueberries are blue and tasty. The challenge with the blueberries is to pick enough while walking. If you are not careful you can spend up to 15 minutes picking berries. 
Yesterday we booked a room in Dalton because of the storm. It was great walking into town knowing that there was a warm shower and a bed waiting for us. The owner told us that the hotel has been fully booked for the last 3 weeks by thru hikers. 

Today we ran into a number of hikers that we have not seen for a while. We all have understand what it has taken to get here and so the comeradery among us is very high. It is a great feeling to belong to such a focused, determined-to-succeed group of people. It does underline the fact that we have walked for 113 days. 

We arrived, had a good cup of coffee and a shower. Then off to Walmart to resupply and to grab some lunch at Applebees. A great chain that serves good food at reasonable prices. 
The trail today was mainly downhill with the normal ups and downs as we did the 12 miles in 3,5 hours. Dandelion had town legs with myself and 4th quarter (Angie) running along behind her. It is amazing how fast we can all hike when we are going into town.

Dandelion, Fourth Quarter and Pathfinder stayed up late last night watching My 600 pound life"" and a program about squeezing pimples. We only woke up at 7am this morning and because it was a short day, it was a slow to get going day. We finally left the hotel at 9am because it was raining until then. 
This is the 5th day of hiking in the rain and we are slowly getting tired of all the damp. As I write this, the sun is shining and the forecast is for sunshine for the next three days. It will be great to get to the top of Greylock and see the views. 

We left Dalton and walked down the street admiring the pretty houses with summer gardens. Then into the forest and up a mountain on our way to Cheshire and the ice cream shop. The Chocolate milkshakes were really good. It started to rain while we were there so we stood around and chatted to all the other hikers waiting for the rain to stop. 

Then off to the convenience store which has a Dunkin doughnuts shop next door. So coffee and donuts for lunch, Dandelion bought a sandwich and Fourth grabbed a salad. Then Pathfinder offered to carry 12 donuts up the mountain if I paid for them. We are having coffee and donuts for desert tonight. 

The shelter we are in is 3 miles from the top of Greylock mountain. Most hikers spend the night on top of Greylock in the bunkhouse. We spent the night at the hotel last night so another night in a paid hostel was just not on. We will get there for coffee and hopefully a great view. 
Greylock is the first 3000 foot mountain since Virginia and is the the first of the bigger mountains as we go North. From here the mountains get progressively higher until we climb Mount Washington at 6500 feet. Greylock is the first training mountain for the big ones. 
The next few weeks is all about climbing big mountains every day. Yippee.

Rain rain rain. Day 6. 
We are in the shelter with 8 other thru hikers and at least 10 tents are pitched around the shelter. Only 2 hikers are section hikers. I am not sure why but we seem to have joined a group of thru hikers who are all hiking the same mileage. 
The trick is to leave early and get to the shelters around 4pm. Then you have your choice of tent areas or spaces in the shelters. The other hikers who arrive late look longingly into the shelter and when it is full sadly move onto a camping site. The trail is turning into a race for places to sleep every night. 
Today was a big day. 
We climbed Greylock. The first over 3000 feet mountain for a long time. The climb itself was not bad, the coffee and breakfast roll were excellent. The clouds had moved away so we had a really nice view from the top. Then down the mountain. It took just over 2,5 hours to walk down the mountain. 

We also crossed into Vermont. First Mas had to have the last stay. A steep boulder hop up a 200 foot climb and then scramble up a 150 foot mud track to get to the top of the mountain. 1 mile on, we crossed into Vermont. Vermont is known a Vermud. The first 100 feet and we were into mud. 
Just before mile 1600, as we were rushing to the shelter to beat the rain, I stepped onto a rock and down I went. I was full of mud and sadly I have bent my hiking pole. I was not a happy hiker.

We heard about a motel that charges $80 for 4 people including a shuttle to and from the trail head. Since it was just 1.5 miles more than we were going to walk, it was an easy decision to book a room and spend the night in town, drying out. As I write this, the sun is shining and the storms have not arrived ..... yet. In the mountains around us we can see the storms and the rain. It also gave us a chance to shower, do laundry and go out for chinese food. A perfect threesome for a hiker. The trail today was wet and rocky. Of course we had ups and downs. Today we seemed to have a lot of ups and the downs seemed very long. The last down to the road was rocky and steep. By this time our legs were tired from all the hopping and skipping to avoid the water and the mud on the trail. Our steps reminded me of a boxer in the ring. One step right, 2 steps forward, 2 steps left and on we go. Of course you try and keep your feet dry. None of us were very successful in doing that.  The challenge with wet feet is all the rubbing and chaffing that goes on. The tops of your toes are rubbed raw and then stay raw until they dry out. In our case, day 8 of rain is not helping our feet. The shorter days slow us down a bit, but I believe we have no other choice if we are to finish this. It is sort of holding back a bit so that we are in good shape for the last push. Angie is getting her trail legs and is keeping up with us. I think her and Dandelion enjoy town more than the wet cold trail. It will be difficult to get them going again in the morning.

What a great day. 
We left the motel at 8.30am and by 8.45am we were on the trail. It was a gentle switchback up the mountain and we climbed for about 30 minutes and got to the top. We knew that we had a long climb ahead and the trail wound gently upwards for the next 10 miles climbing up 1850 feet. The trail would go over a gentle uphill and then level a bit and then a gentle uphill to the next level bit. The weather was cool and cloudy and a gentle breeze to keep us cool. Too good to be true. 
Then ..... the last 0.8 mile was a steep uphill with steps that made you forget the last 10 miles. We huffed and puffed up to the fire tower. 
Lunch at the fire tower with great views across the valleys and a good look at the mountains we need to climb in the next week. Then a quick 4 miles down to the shelter. The emphasis here is on the downhill. It was long and steep but it was dry. That was great. 

Today was the first time that I got to the shelter and the shelter was full. There was only one campsite at the shelter which we grabbed. 
The shelter and the camp site sit on an open hill and face east so we will get to see the sun rise. This is only one of two shelters that face east over an open valley. 
This is the 5th night that the shelter has been full mainly because we are starting to see southbound hikers and hikers hiking the long trail. The social interaction has been fantastic. We are still part of the group hiking north and the whole group is traveling up the trail together. Lots and lots of fun. 

Today we met one of the oldest hiker on the trail -77 years old and doing his 4th thru hike and two of the youngest, a brother and sister - 8 and 10 years old. They were hiking with their father and they planned a grand adventure every year. I like their spirit.","Bennington

Our last zero day was 11 days ago. Going into town and knowing that you are not going to walk the next day is an amazing feeling. You feel like you do the day before your birthday or Christmas. I can lie in my bed tomorrow and read or sleep or watch a movie on my phone. I don't have to get up early, pack up our tent and walk 15 miles. I can also eat food from a refrigerator and get water from a tap and drink without having to filter first. This trail teaches you what is important. 
The shelter is one of the biggest on the trail and has space for 30 hikers. All night there is movement as people shuffle and roll over or get up to go to the loo. Some people snore and sniffle. Some people have sleep apnea and almost die every 30 minutes. At 5.30am people start to stir, letting the air out of mattresses and making coffee. Once one gets up, everyone gets up. 
We left the shelter at 6.30am with a spring in our step. The profile showed no major climbs, just a gentle up and down for a 9.5 mile walk to the road and then a quick walk into Manchester. The trail was dry today and so we made great time. By 10am we were in town and having coffee and doughnuts at Mrs Murphy coffee shop. Had some great banter with the owner and locals and got given two cloves of garlic to cook with. 
Then on to shop for food for the next two days. Chicken and potato salad and things to nibble on and drink while we rest. 
Tonight we sat and planned our next section to Hanover.","Stratton Road

A grand rest day. 
Breakfast at the up cafe. A hikers breakfast that is served on two plates. 
Plate 1 had three enormous pancakes with butter.

Plate 2 has 2 eggs, sausage, bacon and toast. 
What a great breakfast. 
The one waitress asked us if we were from South Africa and when we said yes, showed us her tattoo which read ""liefie"". She was married to a South African who died 3 years ago. She stood and chatted for a while and when we left she was in tears because of her memories. We wrote a note to her children in Afrikaans just because we could and to remind them of their family in South Africa. 
Then a quick planning meeting to agree the week ahead and to finalize our resupply requirements. 
A quick resupply and back to the hostel by 12pm for a lazy afternoon of rest before we start the next 100 miles to Hanover. 
Angie cooked spaghetti and mince for supper tonight. It had onions and garlic and tomatoes and some herbs. There was not a scraping left and every bowl was licked clean. This was followed by a Ben and Jerry half pint of ice cream for desert and then coffee. 
We leave at 8am tomorrow morning and will be in Hanover (mile 1750) next Wednesday.

Miles walked 16.5
We arrived at the shelter at 4pm and quickly put up our tents. The shelter is right on the big branch river which is quite rocky and so has lots of little rapids to get your sore and tired muscles massaged. We spent the next hour in an ice cold jacuzzi. It was fantastic. The feet and shoulders got most of the attention but other parts such as the calves and thighs also got a pummeling. Water is such a great way of ending off a hot long hike. 
Today there were three nice climbs when leaving Manchester. 
The first was Bromley Mountain. You did not even have a chance to warm up the legs and you were climbing. Luckily it started gradually but got steeper as we neared the top. The top is also the top of some ski slopes so there is a ski lift as well as a small cabin on top. Hikers are allowed to spend the night in the cabin. 
Then we had a great 2 hour meander across the top of the mountains and down into the valley. Yep, down into the valley always means up the other side. The other side was Styles Peak and then Peru Peak. A nice climb that is preparing the legs for the climbs to come. The climb lasted a good hour and a half before we went down steeply to the Peru shelter for lunch. 
Lunch was boiled eggs we carried from the hostel and some crackers. Having eggs on the trail is a luxury. The girls went and lay on the tent pad in the sun for half an hour enjoying the trail. 
The afternoon started with a gentle downhill then a stiff 150 foot rock scramble up Bakers Peak. Sometimes we don’t walk the trail, we scramble or heave ourselves up the trail to make progress. Bakers Peak was a bit of a heave ho. 
The rest of the trail was a gentle sloping down for 6 miles to the shelter. 
The zero day yesterday was great, but it is good to be back on the trail and moving forward.

We got to the shelter in the pouring rain. The shelter was almost full. Luckily Pathfinder had gone ahead and reserved some space on the bottom shelf. 4 people on a 3 meter by 3 meter shelf. When it rains we all snuggle up to make space for more hikers. 
Today we had two instances of trail magic. 
1. Hard core gave us a coke each. We carried that up Bear Mountain and sat at the top and enjoyed an ice cold coke. 
2. When we got to the shelter someone had left a packet of real coffee at the shelter. We made cowboy coffee. You boil the water, add the coffee and bring to the boil. Then switch off and leave for a few minutes. Bring back to the boil and then leave for a few minutes until the grounds settle. Pour carefully. The coffee tasted great but very strong. Will need to add a little less coffee next time. 

Vermont has decided that before we get to a shelter, you need to climb (scramble) up a steep rock face to earn your rest. Today was no exception. 

We crossed the Clarendon river after lunch with just 3.7 miles to go to the shelter. The suspension bridge swayed and rocked as we crossed. Dandelion was not impressed. We then started the climb up to the shelter. A 500 foot scramble up a 70 degree incline with large rock steps for us to scramble up. To try this at home, put on a backpack that weighs 12 - 15 kgs and then find a flight of stairs where the stairs are 40 - 45 cm high. To make it more realistic, make the steps uneven and slant backwards or forwards, left or right. Then add a light drizzle to make the rocks slippery. I sometimes wonder if they want us to finish this hike. We survived and are dry and comfy in the shelter. 

This morning we were up and hiking at 6.45am. The first hour was flat and fast. We stopped for breakfast at Little Rock Pond after 3 miles. Then up the first climb of the day, a 1400 foot mountain with a whole rock garden at the top. Hikers have created stone statues from all the rock and as you hike through, you add your rocks to the creations. There are some spectacular creations. 
Then down the mountain, across the road and up Bear Mountain. We sure huffed and puffed up Bear Mountain. We are back in the world of mountains with multiple summits and little rock outcrops that have to be climbed and conquered. Today we climbed and conquered 3 mountains.

I forgot to tell you about our bear bags at Big Branch shelter. We hung our bearbags over the river and went to sleep. In the morning, we dropped our bags and saw that Dandelion and Fourth Quarter's bags had been nibbled on. The squirrels had gotten into the bags and eaten some protein bars and nuts. Both food bags had teeth marks. 

Back to today. 
Three major happenings today. 
We climbed Mount Killington today. A big 4000 foot mountain that is the last big climb before Hanover. It was a long slow climb that took just over 2 hours. We passed the 500 miles to go mark today.
We passed the 1700 mile mark.
A big day for us. It did not start well. We woke up in the rain. Everything on the trail was wet. We had to cross two rivers that had come down in flood. The water was gushing up to our knees. The big decision here is to remove your hiking shoes or just plow on. We decided to just plow on through, mainly to wash the mud from our shoes and socks. It worked but in 5 minutes there was mud everywhere. Oh well, that's been the story of Vermont.

We finished around 3.30pm and hitched into town with an ex-hiker who has hiked some of the trail in Vermont. We were headed for the Yellow Deli Hostel. A hiker hostel that is part of the 12 tribes religious organization. The talk on the trail is that it is a sect, but the beds are free and the breakfast good. We will make a small donation to cover our cost. 

We have resupplied and are ready to go.

The sun came out to play today and should stay out for the whole of this week. This will brighten up our days and our moods. 
We started the day with a great breakfast at the Yellow Deli. Scrambled eggs with vegetables, de-hulled wheat, toast and coffee. All this for a donation and some help in cleaning up afterwards. We caught the 9.15am bus to the trail head. 
Last night there were 42 hikers at the hostel. The majority are north bound. The good thing is we knew most of the hikers by sight and at least 20% by name. It is great to catch up and swap trail stories. Tonight they are expecting over 60 hikers. 
The first attraction was Gifford State Park, a camping park for hikers and cyclist. The office sold ice cream and sodas so we had to stop and rest. Cokes for all and ice cream to share. 
Then Thundering Falls - spectacular. The falls are not that high but the volume of water was great. 
Then Thundering Falls boardwalk across a marsh created by the falls. The boardwalk leads to the challenge of the day. 
Quimby mountain - 1335 feet in 1.75 miles. The climb started at 12 noon with a few gentle switchbacks that did nothing to warn you of the climb ahead. The trail then gets real mean and just goes straight up the mountain with an occasional left or right turn to avoid small cliff face. By 1pm we were nearing the top, sweat dripping of us , legs pumping and lots of huffing and puffing. By now we huff and puff but don’t stop. I guess that is called trail legs. 
At the top was a small campsite. A great place for a quick lunch then down to the shelter. 
Stoney Brooke is a small stream but we managed to find a place to cool down and wash the sweat from ourselves and from our clothes. 
It was great to do a short day, rest our legs, set up camp early and rest. Lying reading a book in the forest at 4pm is luxury.

Miles walked 16 

As long as we walk a reasonable amount of miles a day, we will stay on track to finish on the 12 September-ish. 
This morning was one of the most difficult mornings we have had on the trail for a long time. 
It was up and down. Not big ups and downs but small 100 foot ups and downs with two bigger ones thrown in for fun. 
It was very hot. We did not have enough water with us and did not fill up at the last water source because there was meant to be water further on. There was not. 
One liter of water for the whole morning was not nearly enough. 
Interestingly, the lack of water translates to almost no energy in your legs and you feel yourself dragging up the hills. 
We did ration the water but in the heat, two sips every half hour is not enough to sustain you. 
By 12 noon we were fantasizing about cold gatorades at the Edge Farmstall just 1 mile away. Luckily the last mile was downhill. 
The farmstall only opens Wednesday to Sunday. Today is Monday. They had a sign that pointed to a spigot outside where hikers can fill their water bottles. We filled, we drank, we filled again. We had lunch on the grass in the shade of a big pine tree. Just as we were about to leave, the owner arrived and opened up specially for us to get something cold. Cold always tastes good. 
The afternoon was much better. Properly fed and hydrated, the climb was steep and long but doable and we all felt strong after lunch. 
3 miles on, we found a campsite next to a stream. We had done enough miles for the day so we dropped our bags, pitched our tents and rested sore and aching feet and muscles. 
Everyday day now we try and camp close to water to cool down and to try and clean up a little bit. The feeling of cold water splashed on your face and the rest of you is energizing and revitalizing and sort of gets you settled down after a long day. The cold water is good for our muscles and our feet. 

Our feet don’t hurt while we walk but once the shoes come off and we stop walking then the pains start. Our feet are bruised on the bottom from the long miles and there is no cure but rest. Rest is not an option now. I suppose we will just grit our teeth at night and keep on walking during the day.

We crossed into New Hampshire today. State number 13. New Hampshire is 160 miles long that includes the White Mountains with lots of high mountains including Mount Washington. This is going to be fun. 
The plan today was to walk 15 miles to Happy Hill Shelter and then a short 5 mile walk to town tomorrow. 
We arrived at the shelter around 2.30 pm. A bit early to finish for the day and there was no water at the shelter and there was a storm brewing. A quick conference and a change of plan. Book a last minute hotel room and head for town 5 miles away. We were chased all the way by the storm and almost made it. We just hit town when the storm broke. 
The walk into Hanover is a 2 mile road walk. We walked in the rain watching all the people stuck in rush hour traffic. We were getting wet but I would not change places for anything. 
A quick cup of coffee and a bus trip to the hotel and we are in a hotel room.Today the trail was soft and well maintained. We walked through forest and then out into open areas with blackberry bushes that force you to to stop and pick. We passed an apple tree that was planted by Johnny Appleseed and ate an apple.

There was real excitement this morning. Grown up people doing a little jig down to breakfast and lots of laughter and silly remarks. A double zero and we were being hosted by Denise and Brian for three nights. 

We caught the bus back to Hanover and dropped our packs at the Dartmouth Outdoor Centre. They have a common room that they make available to thru hikers to just chill. 
We collected our parcels from the post office. Brand new shoes for Dandelion and all our winter gear from Art. 
Seeing the winter gear is both exciting (we are close to the whites) and depressing (we are adding 3 pounds to our base weight). It is amazing how much clothes weigh. 
There is a coffee shop in town who loves hikers and to show their love, they give each hiker a free donut. They were very busy so we just grabbed a soda each and our free donut. We sat on the bench outside and watched the people walk by. People watching is such a great way to spend some time to feel connected to the normal world. 
Lunch was with Brian and Denise at a great pub and they had Guinness on tap. The first Guinness of the trail. It was cold and very good. 
We are now sitting on the back deck, a good coffee in hand and just enjoying the luxury of sitting on chairs and having good conversations with people who are not hikers. 
Even more exciting, tomorrow is also a zero day.

I love slack packing. If we could afford the $ 20 000 it would cost, we would slack pack the whole trail. 
I carried the backpack for the first two hours then Dandelion for two hours and Fourth Quarter for two hours. That means that Pathfinder has to buy and wear a bright pink of hot pants and hike in them for a day. Photos to follow. 
Today Brian hiked the first 3 miles with us. It was great to have him along for the first part of the day. He added a new vibe and local knowledge of birds and trees to the hike. We now know that the bird that sings is a Wood Thrush. Brian said goodbye at the three mile mark after taking pictures at Holts Ledge snd walking down to the Beaver Lake. 
That is where our work started. Moose Mountain. A great long uphill climb with a few false plateaus and finally the summit with no views. We compensated by sitting on a rock and having a home made pulled pork sandwich with barbecue sauce. Food tastes awesome after a big climb. 
We climbed the smaller south peak of Moose Mountain and then down to Hanover. The down took about 3.5 hours and as usual, we did the up and down routine to finally get into town and were picked up by Brian and taken home to shower and eat. We are going to miss the Sullivans tomorrow night. 
I counted 27 north bound hikers today. All of them thru hiking and most of them slowing down to enjoy the last time on trail. It is great to catch up with people you have not seen for a month, but we are all sharing the same experiences, but with different details. 
There is a definite sense of excitement to leave in the morning. We are going into the Whites.

Thank you Brian and Denise. Your hospitality was amazing. You made it very difficult to leave this morning. 
Brian and Denise dropped us at the trailhead this morning and we were met by Scott and Joanni with a parcel from home. They also decided to walk a few miles with us up the first bit of Smart Mountain. It was great to walk and chat with them. Thank you for the parcel Megan. 
Today we start the approach to the White Mountains. A big mountain to climb everyday. The climb gets a bit bigger and challenging everyday until we climb Mount Washington. Our daily milage will come down a bit because of the big mountains. 
First up is Smart Mountain. A mountain just over 3300 feet. We started the climb to the first ridge. A challenging first section of fairly steep climbs and rocky steps. A great view from the first ridge and some raspberries to pick. We said goodbye to Scott and Joanni and with a skip in our step tackled the second section. 
This section connects the lower first level with the peak of Smart Mountain. It was a great section on great trail, with gentle ups and downs until you get to section three. The foot of the peak. 
This section is big slabs of rock that you walk up for about 500 feet. The challenge is you cant put your foot down flat, you climb on your toes. This puts an amazing amount of strain on your calves and they burn like crazy. We sweated up this section to the top to be rewarded with lunch and a fire tower to climb. As we looked north, we could see all these towering mountains waiting for us. 
After lunch, we climbed down the mountain. It is easier getting down but the trail was wet and muddy. At the bottom we filled up our water bottles. Water is still an issue and so we had to carry water up to the shelter. I hate doing this because water is really heavy and at the end of the day your legs are tired. 
The hexacube shelter is shaped like a hexacube - 6 sides. and not like a normal 4 sided shelter. 
I am not sure why the shelter was built this way but it is interesting. 
Today was the first day of carrying all our winter clothing again. Our backpacks are full and heavier because of the additional clothes. It is cold tonight so the winter gear is out. If we did not have our clothes, we would have been cold. It feels like autumn is coming and the fact we are going north is making the morning and evenings colder.

That meant we started up Cube Mountain in the rain. Nice big slabs of rocks to walk up and a gentle rain to keep us cool. It was just 1.5 miles up to the top where we stopped for breakfast and a quick pack rest. Another big mountain ticked off the list. 
Down the other side and a great walk through the woods along amazing trail. This trail keeps on amazing us and wowing us even after so many miles. 
As we came down the mountain and across the road to look for a place for lunch, there was Granite State, he thru hiked in 2016, with trail magic of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, brownies,muffins and of course sodas. We spent about 30 minutes swopping stories. 
Up Mist Mountain as we were coming down, I ran into 2 mothers with their 6 children. Spent about 20 minutes talking about the trail. Answered questions like ""how long have we walked for, what we eat, where we sleep"". Who knows, maybe one day one of those children will thru hike the AT. 
It was great arriving at the hostel. We know most of the people so there is a sense of camaraderie and shared experiences/ pain. 
We are spending two nights here at the hostel. Tonight there is a hikers feed so we will be well fed, sleep in a bunk bed (with 20 others in the room) and have a shower.

What an amazing day. 9.8 Miles up to 4800 feet and back down again to the Hikers Welcome Hostel for a shower and an afternoon to rest our tired legs. So proud of Dandelion - first 4000 foot mountain and she just sailed on up all the steep and tricky bits. This is a good sign for the whites. 

Mount Moosilauke has the longest, steepest climb on the trail. 2000 feet in just over 1 mile. 
To try and describe this climb is very difficult but imagine: 
A sign at the bottom of the climb that says the climb is very dangerous and hikers must be prepared to avoid tragic results. A climb up next to an amazing waterfall.The rocks so steep and slippery that they have added wooden steps to help you up.Climbing up these rocks and steps for about 90 minutes before it start to level out. 

The views as you climb are amazing. The waterfall is beautiful and it takes your mind of the steep climb. I must confess that half way through my legs felt like jelly and I was wondering if I would get to the top of the climb. The first part over, you wind along the ridge through pine forest. Because we are so high the trees are really short- about 7 foot. It is strange seeing such small trees. 
Then on to the summit above tree line. Totally in the clouds no view at all. It is still great to get to the top and tick off the first big mountain in the Whites. 
A quick lunch and then all the way down again. 
It is great to end the day with a shower and a soft bed.

Today's hike was one of the most challenging days of this hike. Not only was the hike very technical, it was just slow terrain. Let me explain. 
You start the day with a steep 500 step climb up the side of a mountain. Then a 5 mile approach trail that goes up and down small 500 to 1000 foot climbs just because they are there. The climbs and descents follow the natural rock flow and require a little bit of rock scrambling to get up and down safely. It is very slow going. 
After 4 hours of up and downs, you get to the bottom of the big up to top of the Kinsmans South Peak. 
The first mile you walk next to a beautiful bubbling brook with 2 larger waterfalls and lots of smaller ones. Very very pretty. 
You cross the brook and start the climb up some rock falls. Pleasant, you think. After climbing rock falls for two hours you get to the top. Legs shaking. 
Dandelion was amazing. She just got going and kept on till the top. 
South Peak conquered, on to the North Peak. This meant down the rock falls for 500 foot and then up another 500 foot to the North summit.

The trail builders look for large granite slabs and then route the trail over them. Most of the big slabs have foot holds drilled or chipped onto them to stop you from sliding and landing on your butt. Did I mention the rocks are wet and slippery? This was our route down this 4300 foot mountain. 
Disappointed that we did not get a view from the south peak.

Happy we got some views from our lunch rock on the north peak.

Sad that I lost my glasses and had to buy a pair of reading glasses from the pharmacy to keep me going till I get home. 
The day started at 7am and we got back to the hostel just after 7 pm. It took us 10 hours to hike 17 miles. Under normal hiking conditions, 17 miles would only take about 7 hours. We are very tired but first had to reward ourselves with a tub of Ben and Jerry ice cream.

Miles walked 10.2 

The Franconia Ridge is one of the iconic parts of the trail with every hiker trying to make sure that you did this part on a clear day. The weather forecast was for partly cloudy so we decided to go ahead and take our chances. 
We climbed up the 4000 ft Liberty Mountain and then a quick ridge walk to where the trail starts. The trail is on a narrow ridge and follows the ridge up Little Haystack Mountain (4820 feet ) then Lafayette (5260 feet) before starting its descent to the valley at just over 3500 feet.

We caught the ridge on a bad day. It was cold and misty with a 30 mile per hour wind gusting to 60 miles per hour. It was, for us, one of the most challenging bits if the trail. 

We are starting to realise that the whites are a tough section. Each day we are doing more than 600 foot elevation gain and about the same in elevation loss. It feels like your legs are getting stronger but at night you know that you have worked really hard. The hard part is knowing you have to do it again in the morning. 
The other frustration is that our walking speed has gone down dramatically and it feels like it takes forever to cover the miles. Today we did just over 10 miles in 7 hours. In Virginia we were doing 10 miles before 11 am. Progress is slow but we are still on track for the middle of September. 
We are camped at 3900 feet with a cold wind blowing. First time in a while that beanies and buffs are out and our puff down jackets are on. It is going to be a cold night but we are prepared. 
The main discussion now is what to do about Mount Washington. If the high winds and clouds continue, we are not sure we want to summit the mountain on a cold and foggy day. So do we wait for a good day? If so, how long should we wait. We can't wait too long because we have to finish the trail by the 16th September. Do we move on to the next part of the trail where we are not so high and we can continue walking even if it's cloudy and cold? If we move on, what do we do about this bit of trail we have missed? 
The answer lies in part with Dandelion's ability to continue to face her fear of heights. Today was a very difficult day for her. She faced her fear and won today. It took great courage and determination from her to walk out on that ridge and to keep walking even when the weather was bad, the wind was trying to knock you of the ridge, the mist swirling making everything look a bit more uncertain and lastly climbing higher and higher up exposed ridges of rock. The hardest part is not knowing what could be next. I am not sure Dandelion is capable or willing to face these conditions again and again on this hike. 
There are still a few big mountains to climb in Maine.

It is amazing what a difference a day makes. We woke up to sunshine. That is already a way better start than the last few days. 
Even the climb down from the shelter over rocks and down a stream could not dampen the spirits. It was a 2 hour walk to the Galehead hut and coffee and corn bread for breakfast. 
We walked out to climb South Twin Mountain and on the way up, we passed a hiker with a large 47 on his back. New Hampshire has 48 peaks above 4000 feet. Kevin was climbing the South Twin as his number 48. He has taken 5 years to climb all 48. A group of us thru hikers waited for him at the top and celebrated his number 48 with him. Lots of whistling and clapping to celebrate. It was a great reminder that Kathadin and that celebration waits for us. 
Then onto Zealand Summit. At the top we were told about the grey jays that feed out of your hand. We took some crackers and crumbled them into hand and the birds came. 
Lunch was at the Zealand hut- potato and dill soup with bread, followed by blueberry cake and coffee - luxury. 
A quick 5 mile hike, the first flat easy trail we have had in the Whites and we were at the shelter. A shelter for 8 and there were already 5 in the shelter. The three of us squeezed in and the shelter was full. Rain is predicated for tonight. 
Myself and Angie dropped our bags and headed for the pond to swim and wash off the sweat of the day. The water was cold but that did not stop us from having a great swim while Dandelion washed her feet on the shore. They told us there may be moose on the shore but we have not seen one yet. 

Washington weather is predicated to be good on Sunday so at this stage, we will be going up Washington.

We woke up in the rain this morning. We were in the shelter so we turned over and went back to sleep as we knew today was going to be a short day. Eventually we left at 9 am. The latest we have left a shelter. 
It was an easy walk down to the road. I needed gas and had to get to a campground around 3 miles down the road. 
First we had pancakes as trail magic at the bottom of the mountain. Then a trail angel took Pathfinder to the store and he bought a canister. At $10 it is fantastically expensive. Normal price around $3. But I needed the gas to walk on. 

The weather forecast shows it will be clear on Mount Washington tomorrow so we decided to walk up the mountain. 
There are a few trails up to the camp. The AT is the steepest and rockiest. It also has some large cliffs that need scrambling over. Dandelion asked if we could take an easier less dangly path up. To do this, we need to hitch 4 miles up the road. In the rain a kind couple with 6 kids picked us up and took us to the trail. 
The camp site looks like a war zone. A strong wind blew through here in October and caused serious damage. We are camped on a wooden platform that is flat and raised from the ground. Under the platform is a family of mice. The whole family has come out to smell my shoes and sniff around my feet. We will have to make sure that all our food is packed away tonight. 
Tonight is also going to be cold. There is a very chilly wind blowing the clouds away. We had supper and very quickly climbed into our sleeping bags and zipped up. 
The plan is to be up early to get to the top of Mount Washington as early as possible.

At 10 am we were on top of Mount Washington, 6288 feet high. The mountain was under a light cloud and not too cold. Dandelion had made it to the top thanks to Yodi setting the pace and Fourth Quarter and I following behind. It was an amazing experience to get to the top. 
Dandelion had been nervous for today. Two big mountains to climb and Madison with a very exposed peak. Washington was the first one. 
We had left Mizpah at 6am because we wanted to get the views as we walked towards Washington. You are walking on a high ridge with the most amazing views of the valleys below and the peaks of the mountains in the presidential traverse. We passed over Mount Jackson, Mount Webster, Mount Eisenhower and Mount Pierce. It is truly a beutifull walk. By 8.30a, we were at the Lake of the Clouds hut for coffee and breakfast and then we climbed the last 1.5 miles to the top. 
There is a train and a road that goes to the top so there is a cafeteria style place on the top. There are also lots of people. We had a second breakfast and headed down the mountain to spend the rest of the day walking on big rocks. 
Our next stop was Madison Hut, just 6 miles away. It took us 5 hours to scrabble, slip, slide and walk over the rocks. Just to add to the challenge, 3 biggish climbs needed to be made. 
At Madison we had soup and crackers for lunch. The cook had burnt the brownies so we had those free for desert. Lunch was a social affair with a big group of thru hikers sitting at the table swapping stories. 
Then up Mount Madison. Mount Madison looks like a big dump truck has dumped a huge pile of rocks. It would be fun if it was not so high and exposed. Yodi led the way with me next, Dandelion and the 4th Quarter. The up was good and half an hour later we were at the top. Just 2 miles to go to the campsite. We climbed over the top and down the dragons tail to the tree line. Just like a dragons tail, this climb down had big triangles we needed to clamber over and down. The triangles varied in height from 40 foot to 80 foot. I counted 9 of these and then into the trees. 4th Quarter slipped and fell, and almost slid of the mountain. A rock stopped her from taking a 10 foot fall. No serious injury. 
I don’t want to sound dramatic but the climb down from the tree line to the camp site was the hardest down I have done. Rocks, roots and branches all trying to trip you up. That last mile took almost 1.5 hours. 
We arrived at camp around 5.30pm exhausted but exhilarated by the day. It is late, around 9pm now and tired and exhausted thru hikers who camped at Mizpah with us are still straggling into camp. 
What an amazing day. As a reward, the girls each got a good 10 minute foot rub. 
Tomorow, we go into Gorham and rest.

We slept in today. We were tired after yesterday's hike and just needed a slow start. First we made coffee and sat on the tent pad reliving yesterdays hike. We also emptied our food bags of all the food and bars we had left. We walked into the Notch today with no food left. That is very good planning. 
It took us 2.5 hours to walk the 5 miles to the Notch. The Notch has a hotel plus a vistors centre that sells resupply and a small deli. 
Breakfast was a Washington sandwich. This was a fresh wheat bread sandwich with roast beef, onion, relish, cheese and bacon with chips. Of course as much coffee as we wanted. When I told the cashier we were from South Africa, we got a 60% discount. 
There was a mix up with the shuttle so we waited for 2.5 hours to be picked up and taken to the Barn. We are sleeping in a big barn with lots of beds. It is like being in a shelter with beds and electricity. 
Supper tonight is spaghetti and mince made by the girls. I have been craving this for the last three days.

The Wildcat climb out of Pinkham Notch has a reputation for being steep and rocky and very challenging. Add a very rainy day and everyone thought we were mad. 
The shuttle left at 7am and dropped us at the Notch in pouring rain. Dandelion stayed at the hostel. 
She has decided that she has had enough of the Whites. 
4th Quarter and I started the climb and slowly and carefully made our way up the slabs of rock and the rockfalls. It was a storming day with the rain coming in sideways but we were enjoying the challenge of climbing. Two hours later, we had reached the top. The rain was still coming in sideways and it was freezing. No time to hang around and enjoy the weather. Onwards and upwards (and steep down) to the Carter Gap hut. The hut is the most remote hut in range and can sleep 30 people. We stumbled in wet and cold and slightly hypothermic. At the huts as a thru hiker, you can buy soup and bread for $2. A warm bowl of potato and leak soup plus the chicken mayonnaise sandwich made by Dandelion was lunch. 
All warmed up out we went for the afternoon session which was clearing up a little. The sun even came out to play for a while. Half an hour before the shelter, the next storm rolled in. Wind rain and the temperature dropped to below freezing. It was bitterly cold. Everything is soaking wet. 
We got to the shelter, found a place to set up our tent and dived in. We got into warm clothes (everything we had) and into our sleeping bags and that is where stayed. All our wet clothes we left lying in a damp heap next to the tent. We had breakfast and bars for supper and did not even hang a bear bag. We just got out to rush to the privy and back. The wind was blowing at 40 miles an hour with gusts of 60 miles an hour. All we could do was stay as warm as we could and try to sleep. 
My sleeping pad has been slowly delaminating and chose last night to delaminate with a loud bang. Fourth Quarter volunteered to sleep on my pad and I slept in her pad. 
Not much sleep was had with the sleeping pad not working and the wind howling around the tent. I think we managed a few hours sleep.

We woke up early to freezing weather. So cold that we both decided not to change but walk in the clothes we slept in. In any case, our walking clothes from yesterday were soaking wet and ice cold. It took us longer to pack up because we had just thrown everything into the tent last night and because our hands were freezing. The wind from last night was still blasting away. 
It did not take long for us to realise that hiking up a mountain in all our clothes was not a great idea. We were sweating within the first few minutes. Stop, take off extra clothing, put on ice cold hiking shorts. It is as unpleasant as it sounds. Then up the mountain. 
The mountain is covered in mist with a freezing wind blowing. Stop. Put on warm gear. Then down the other side of the mountain, the sun has come out. Stop take of all the gear. It was just one of those days. 
I have to say that the climb down today was a bit scary. Steep rock slabs that were very slippery without much grip. Both fourth quarter and I slipped but never fell. Then suddenly with 3 miles to go, it was great trail, walking side by side through the forest we felt like we should be singing snd skipping down the trail. I often play music on my phone and yesterday we were singing along as we came down the mountain and Stump was singing to her music as she came up the mountain. We met in the middle and had a little sing along. It was great. 
Today as we came down the trail we met a lady with a 6 week old baby in a sling and a 9 week old Labrador puppy on a lead. The baby was sleeping but the puppy was a bundle of energy. Very cute. 
We arrived back at the hostel around 11.30am. Back home safe and found. 
I took the shuttle to town and bought my third sleeping pad of the trip. (Thermorest will send me a replacement but it will take three weeks). 
This afternoon we will pack our bags and get ready to head out in the morning. The next big challenge is the Mahoosac Notch. A 1.5 mile stretch of large boulders that you need to climb under and over. This normally takes you about 3 hours. Should be fun.

I woke up with a sore throat and a great nasal drip. Dandelion brought me coffee in bed and I took painkillers and went back to sleep. I spoke to Eric the owner and asked if I could get a ride into town to buy some medication and if we could stay an extra night. There were no shuttles to town. The first shuttle would be at 12 noon. 
At 10 we asked which beds were ours, only to be told that they were full and we had to leave.

I caught the 12 noon shuttle to town and bought some medication. 
Back at the hostel Dandelion and 4th Quarter were packing up. 

Suitably medicated, I marched down the trail to spend the afternoon climbing up and down big mountains. The medication had kicked in and my sore throat was gone. We arrived at the campsite around 5pm to set up the tent and discovered a great rock just 5 meters from the tent. The rock became our cooking rock, our watching tv rock and watching the full moon and the stars rock. It was a great evening lying on our backs just relaxing.

 When we started on 4th april, we told everyone we were walking from Georgia to Maine. TODAY WE CROSSED INTO MAINE. I cannot tell you what a great feeling it is to cross into the last state. We just need to walk to Kathadin and climb it to be finished. 
To get there today was a 14 mile day that we all agree was one of the toughest days on the trail. The trail was rocky, steep and included five big climbs above 4000 feet and many exposed ridges. Everytime you went down a bit you climbed again. 
A lot of the climbs were up granite rock faces sloped at 60 degrees and you need to walk up, flat footed to make sure you don’t slide down and hurt yourself. And then just to make matters interesting they take you over rocks that they need to add steps to so you can get up them. For a person who does not like heights that can be intimidating. 
Dandelion just went up and over but I think all the climbs and exposed ridges is starting to take its toll. Everyday there are new challenges to be faced and I think she is running out of energy to face the challenges. 
Today we were also introduced to the Maine bogs. An area on the trail that is a deep mud pool with a plank across it for you to walk on. As you step onto the plank it either remains steady or sinks away under your feet and you sink two feet down into the bog. The challenge is to know which are the sinky ones and which are not. Today I sunk twice. I walk in front so I am the tester while the two ladies watch and wait to see what will happen. Of course I am laughed at when I sink.","Trident Cole Camp site

Today was a big day. 
Mahoosic Notch is a giant boulder field that runs the 1 mile length of the notch. To get into the notch, you climb down a steep hill, scrambling over big boulders and roots to get into the notch. There is a staging area that you can use to put all items into your backpack and pack your poles away. Then into the notch you go following the white blaze. Up and over big boulders, climbing down into gaps and then through tunnels created by the boulders. Easy with no backpack, a bigger challenge with a full backpack. The drops into and through the crawl space are challenging and fairly tight. In a lot of the areas you can hear the underground water running far beneath you. It took us about 1.5 hours to navigate the mile. There were lots of giggles from myself and 4th quarter. Dandelion was using the last of her courage to get through the notch and stay focused. While there were no large exposed areas, there were a few drop offs that needed you to concentrate. 
Breakfast was at the end of the notch and just before the next challenge. 
The Mohhassic Arm. A climb up out of the notch of just over 1500 feet. The climb is mostly on slanting granite slabs and big rock steps. Dandelion's courage bucket lasted to the top of this grueling 3 hour climb and now the bucket is empty. 
The last 10 days hiking the white mountains and now the Mahoosac range have been the most challenging 10 days. Everyday we climb 4000 foot mountains and often 2 or 3 climbs. Every morning you wake up with legs that feel empty and jelly like. Every day we put on the backpack and go another 10 or 15 miles. At the end of the day there is a general feeling of exhaustion. 
After doing 5 miles in 6 hours, we arrived at the campsite. The plan was to hike another 5 miles to the next shelter which was up a steep mountain. 
The consensus was to call it a day. It helped that it was next to a pond that we could swim in. We dropped our packs and went swimming. After lunch, the girls had an afternoon nap. A great sunday afternoon only spoilt by late afternoon rain. 
It seems that we are not the only ones to take a short day. The camp site was full with hikers all taking a short day and resting up. 
Today the discussion is focused around the next few days of hiking. There are some big mountains coming up and Dandelion is not keen to walk them. I want to walk the whole trail so it seems that I might do some slackpacking while Dandelion stays in town. It seems like a good compromise.

We started the day at 7.30am and ended at 5.30am. A very long day by our standards. The going in Maine is very slow. The trail is rocky and very rooty. At the road we waited for the shuttle to take us into Andover. 
Andover is a small town in Maine with one store and a hiker hostel. 
Today we climbed 4 big mountains over 4000 feet with the last mountain having great big granite slabs to walk up ( bald pate). The view from the top was amazing. You could see forever. 
The first mountain we climbed was cold and wet with the mist being blown up the mountain by a strong wind. Of course we went right over the top with a rocky outcrop exposed to the weather. We were buffeted by the wind and at times had to use our hiking pokes to stay upright. 
A very trying and stressful day for Dandelion. Dandelion is struggling to cope with all the exposed areas. It is very stressful for her to face this every day and even more stressful not knowing what the next big mountain will bring. Myself and 4th Quarter are doing the best we can to support Dandelion as she climbs.

Today we climbed Moody Mountain and Wyman Mountain. We slack packed today and Dandelion spent the day at the hostel. 
The hike was quick and the 10 miles were done and dusted by 1.30pm. The shuttle was due to pick us up at 2.30pm. As we crossed to the road, we crossed a river with a swimming hole and a small waterfall. We just had to swim. The water was ice cold but great for tired and sore muscles. We are trying to take every opportunity to swim in the rivers and ponds of Maine. 
When we arrived back at the hostel, Dandelion asked to talk to me. She had spent the morning thinking about the hike and the next 250 miles. Dandelion has faced her fear of heights over the last 300 miles and everyday she has shown courage and determination to climb them and conquer them. This she has done with true courage. She told me that she had enough and wanted to leave the trail. 
After much discussion, it was decided that Dandelion would be picked up by Brian and Denise and taken to Hanover. Myself and 4th Quarter will continue on to Kathadin with our trail family. We have made so many friends on the trail that we want to summit Kathadin with. We will do everything we can to safely finish this trail as quickly as we can and get back to Dandelion. 
Dandelion insisted that I finish what we had started together and I am very grateful that we agreed this. It is something that has become important to me as we walked the miles together. 
This was a very difficult decision for her and I ask that you keep her in your prayers as she rests and regains her energy and Spirit.

Our shuttle left at 6am this morning. It was very difficult saying goodbye to Dandelion this morning. Brian and Denise were picking her up this morning to take her to Hanover. We will not see each other for just over two weeks. We will continue to walk the last miles as quickly as we can so that we can end this hike and start our road trip. 
Another tough day in Maine. Bemis Mountain and Old Blue Mountain needed to be climbed. Some climbs are easy and some are more challenging. The first climb up to Bemis Mountain had me dripping with sweat and heaving for breath for the first 2 hours. Sometimes the trail sucks and you just need to dig deep and put one foot in front of the other. In this morning's case it was just up and up over roots and rocks. I will not let this trail beat me. 
Old blue was a gentle climb up to the top where we stopped for lunch. 
Just as we finished lunch of left over pizza and eggs the rain came bucketing down. That dampened things a little so we raced down the mountain to beat the rain. What started as a gentle decline soon turned in a steep dive down the side of the mountain. We walked next to steep drop offs and I was glad that Dandelion had decided not to carry on. Today's walk down showed that Dandelion had made the right decision. 
We walked South today so we passed most of our trail family going North. Everyone expressed sadness at Dandelion leaving as they all recognize the amazing effort required to have reached this point of the hike. The people on this trail are amazing. 
We finished the descent and luckily there was a river to have a quick swim in before the shuttle arrived.

It was with a heavy heart that we left the hostel this morning. It is just not the same without Dandelion. I am sure that she will enjoy every minute of her time in Hanover. 
With full packs 4th Quarter and I set out to this morning with no real plan. We just wanted to walk as far as as we could. Our plan is to get to Kathadin as fast as we can so that we can join Dandelion and plan a road trip before we go home. 
The trail today was an easy up down but as always in Maine, slow going. We are walking towards Saddle Back, a large 4800 foot mountain that we will climb in the morning. We can see the mountain as we walk. It just seems to get bigger and bigger. Oh well, that is tomorrow's issue. Lunch was next to an amazing beaver pond. We could see their wall but no beavers. 
We eventually got to the lean too around 5pm and decided enough is enough. Legs and minds are tired out from the days walking.

There is a large group of freshman camped out. Some sort of orientation process that is taking place. Nice quiet group that meant we were asleep by 8.30pm. The days are definitely getting shorter and the nights colder. Last night was a long sleeve wool top, fleece top and feather jacket inside my sleeping bag. Cosy but you can feel summer is coming to an end. 
I have decided that Maine is one of the prettiest places I gave seen. Large mountains with amazing lakes and forest as far as you can see. The people are friendly and we seem to spend a lot of time talking to locals on the trail. Everyone seems to just enjoy being outside. 
This is the last state and so far it has been amazing.

What an amazing day. Day 150 on the trail. 150 days of walking. It is hard to comprehend that we have spent so much time in the trail. 
Today we climbed Saddleback mountain. A slow climb that took us up above tree line and all across and up large slabs. What a fantastic view. You can see 360 degrees across Maine. It was fantastic, amazing. The mountain was not that busy but we got talking to a couple from Boston. They shared their choc chip cookies and cheese with us. We spent 1 hour there just drinking in the view. 4th Quarter even brewed some coffee. 
This is the first in a a range of five big mountains. Today we also climbed the Horn and Saddleback Junior. 
We are camped next to a stream and I am writing this blog from a rock in the sun at the top of a waterfall. It is amazingly beautiful. 
On the way down we passed Pappie, an 87 year old man trying to thru hike. He started in Springer then flip flopped to Kathadin from Pearisberg ( over 800 miles away) and is now on the way south. We cannot believe he walked up the steep downhill we were climbing down. What an amazing person. 
Our trail family seems to be growing and Willow, Magic Pants and G wheeze seemed to have joined the family. 4th Quarter is like a mother hen trying to keep all her chickens together. 
We now need to decide how to finish this walk. Our legs are tired and we want to keep walking. We don't want to waste a day with a zero. We want to get back to Dandelion as quickly as we can. On the other hand, we need to take a break to make sure we reach the end. 
To complicate matters, walking in Maine is slow. A great day is 15 miles and that could take up to 10 hours of walking. You also need to be careful that you don't fall. Downhill in Maine is climbing down big rocks. This sometimes takes longer than the uphills. 
Most of the conversation on the trail is now about finishing. How and when. About not taking chances now and encouraging one another every day to keep on walking. There are only two more towns, Stratton and Monson to resupply at and then it is done.

We got to within 20 feet. The moose just stared at us and turned around and quietly walked into the forest. What a privilege. 
We also crossed the 200 mile to go line today. Just 200 miles left of this epic adventure. We stopped and made a hand made sign to celebrate this. I have walked over 1900 miles or 3166 km since 4th april. We have eaten too many rice and pasta sides and I will not miss instant mashed potato at all. We have stayed in interesting places and places that left you giggling because of the bed or the bathroom in the hotel. 
Being Saturday, the trail was busy. It seems the section up to Sugar Loaf Mountain is a really popular day hike. We spent at least 30 minutes talking to day hikers and just sharing our hike with others. 
The amazing thing about this hike is when you stand on a mountain and look north and see in the distance a wind farm high on a mountain top. Then three days later you stand on a mountain top and look south and see the same wind farm in the distance. It is an amazing feeling to know that the you have walked through the wilderness and over the mountains in between. And we have loved every step and been awed by the views of this amazing state and trail. We are savoring every last step this trail has to offer. We are missing sharing all this with Dandelion, but know that she is being well looked after in Hanover.

A rest day. 
We decided to take a rest day today and just get ready for the last 190 miles. My legs just needed a chance to recover after all the 4000 foot mountains. 

We have two more to do tomorrow and then there are no more big mountains until Kathadin. 
Our plans have changed a bit and we have decided to shuttle 30 miles to gain 2 days so that we can try and finish next friday and get back to Leslie by next Sunday. 
Stratton is the second last town on the trail and is really a very friendly hiker town. It is also the town that every hiker stops at before going on to Monson. Last night we went out to the White Wolf for their hiker burger. We knew all the hikers there and everybody is really excited by the fact we have less than 200 miles to go. 
We are rested and ready to get this finished now.","Stratton

Little biggelow lean to mile 2018 
Miles walked 15,3 

It took us 3 minutes to hitch a ride back to the trail. We were dropped at the trailhead. At least 10 other hikers were there and a grand reunion and catch up was had. It is great to be part of this community where we all care for one another and want each other to succeed. 

Once the euphoria wore off it was back to the business of doing miles. Todays miles were challenging. The Bigelows are the last 4000 feet peaks that we needed to climb. Like every other big mountain it takes effort and patience. Today took a great deal of both. We climbed from 9 am am and kept on climbing up and over ever bigger peaks until we could see the two Bigelow peaks. A straight up climb got us in to the first peak with 360 degree views of the lakes and forest of Maine. It was glorious. So good that 4th Quarter and I had to do a dance to Mango Groove. It was also a great lunch stop. 
Lunch was special. We had kept some pork steak from dinner the previous night and put the meat on a bun. What a great lunch. 
Then up the other peak (a straight up rock scramble) and views forever. 
Then came Little Bigelow. A much smaller mountain but one that went on forever. We walked up the south side and then along the top. Up and down and around and then up and down. We spent most of the afternoon trudging along the top of this mountain. It creates a bit of frustration when you want to get down and finish the day. 
At last we reached the shelter around 5.30pm. We were hot and sweaty and decided on a swim in the tubs. The tubs are natural pools created by the rocks. The water was freezing so it was a very quick in and out. 
It was great having all the Tramily at the shelter. We are all in step once again until myself and Angie shuttle up to Monson. 

Angie has become a thru hiker. Last night when she cleaned up after frying the pork in butter, she licked the pan clean of all fat and butter before washing the pan. No fat or food goes to waste. 
The conversation on the trail is now no longer about food or the weather. There is only one focus. Kathadin. Everyone is talking about the end, the sense of achievement of walking 2190 miles and how this may change our lives. 
It has been an amazing enrichment experience with many lessons learned. 
The biggest lesson for me is that if you work patiently towards something it will come. Every day we have walked one step at a time and every day we arrive at our destination. Patience and determination will get you there.","Stratton

East carry pond mile 2029.9 
Miles walked 11.9 
At last Maine has become freindly. The trail has flattened out and the rocks and roots now occasionally trip you up. The big mountains are gone and the ups are now shorter and gentler. 11.5 miles took us just over 5 hours of walking. 
The day started with trail magic after 1.5 miles. Cans of soda in the stream and really good grapes and apples in a bag hanging from a tree. Then 0.5 of a mile down road coffee, breakfast burgers and lots of extra snacks and sodas. We took our backpacks off and spent an hour chatting and eating and drinking coffee. 
At East Carry Pond around 12pm. The sun is shining and the water is cool. We had no choice but to drop our bags and dive in. It was also time for a snack. 
We decided to do lunch at East Carry pond and persuaded the trail family to stop at the beach for lunch and a swim. It was like a day at the beach. All of us on the water and then on the little beach having lunch. Pathfinder does not swim but Norvegan and Hank swam with us. 
It was an warm sun filled afternoon and we spent it swimming and just enjoying the pond and the beach. We decided not to go to the shelter but just camp where we are. 
Tomorrow we walk 9 miles and then shuttle up to Monson so that we can start the last section of the trail.

Monson mile 2076,4 

Miles traveled 46.5 

Today we walked 11 miles to Carratank and then shuttled to Monson. 
To do that we needed to wake up at 5.30am and be walking by 6am. The sun woke us up as it came up over the mountains. It woke up the loons as well so we had an alarm clock provided by nature. 
What a great trail for a change. No big climbs, just a gentle trail around the ponds and then down to the river. Around 8am we stopped for breakfast next to a stream. Breakfast the last few days has been chocolate breakfast essentials and muesli. It tastes really good and seems to give us energy. The chocolate milk takes me back to being young again and eating Coco Pops. 
Around 9am the thunder and lightning started and the rain came bucketing down. 30 minutes of rain and we were soaked and the trail had turned to a stream. The rain was warm and we were going into town so we just walked and sang in the rain. 
11am and we were waiting for Gary to row his canoe across the river and fetch us. 4th Quarter insisted on rowing so I sat in the middle and was taken across without having to lift a finger. I liked that. 
At the Carratunk House we ordered pulled pork sandwiches and giant milkshakes. We also managed to do a reasonable resupply. 
It was with a heavy heart that we got into the shuttle. Our trail family stayed behind and will take two days of walking to get to Monson. We are not sure we will see them on the trail again. We need to keep walking so that we can get back to Dandelion. 
We have now arranged our food drop in the 100 mile wilderness and are ready to walk out in the morning and get the last section done. 
When I think of finishing, it is just overwhelming to think that this journey is coming to an end. At the end I will be calked a Thru Hiker and will have completed a 2190 mile journey ON FOOT. 
I am so sad that Dandelion is not here with us to share that moment. 

On a practical note there is no service in the wilderness so I will keep on writing the blogs, but you may only hear from me once we have climbed Kathadin.

4th Quarter has taken over the roll of mother hen. She feels responsible for our hiking family, who she calls her chickens. This morning we see saw Ripley at the trailhead. She flew out out of the shuttle and gave Ripley a great big hug to welcome him back to the family. Ripley had a big big smile on his face. 
Day one of the hundred mile wilderness proved to be as big a challenge as was expected. 15 miles in 9 hours. Slow going over rocks, roots and mud. The trail planners designed this trail to be tough. You walk along a contour path that winds along the side of the mountain. Up 5 feet down, 5 feet, climb over roots. Up 6 foot down 8 foot, climb over more roots. You can never just walk. You need to watch every step. Then the climbs you do are rock scrambles up the side of a mountain. The down is just a steep rock scramble down where you have to be very careful not to fall and hurt yourself very badly. 
All this makes for long tough day of hiking. 
We started at 8.00am and finished at 5.30pm. 9 hours of walking for 14 miles. We pitched our tent with Ninja and Slacker. They made a great fire and cooked supper and sat around telling stories. By 7.45pm we were in our tent and fast asleep. Ya Ya and Gerber arrived around 7.00pm, put their packs down, blew up sleeping pads and went to sleep. They were so tired they just collapsed. It was a tough day. 
This 100 mile wilderness is harder than we thought and is going to take some serious walking to get this done. It seems that they have left some of the big challenges for last. 

Maine is also the most beautiful state and today we saw the most amazing views of this wilderness. We could see forever. There are ponds everywhere surrounded by thick green forest. The trees are slowly changing color and occasionally we see the red and hold of autumn leaves.

East Chairback Pond mile 2105.1 
Miles walked 14.6 

We passed the 2100 mile mark today. Just a few sticks on a rock saying 2100 miles. This feels very weird because miles left are now double digits. Less than 85 miles to go. I cannot explain what it feels like to realize that this journey is coming to an end. Almost 5.5 months of walking nearly every day and now there is less than 7 days walking. 
When we started it took 11 days to walk 100 miles. Now we will do this in 7 and climb another 6000 foot mountain to finish. Amazing. 

The weather is starting to turn. Today there was an icy wind blowing in from the north. Tonight is going to be another ""wear all your clothes and climb into your sleeping bag"" early night. Angie wears all her clothes to bed and normally has the sleeping bag pulled way over head to stay warm. It was cold this morning and she was not very happy to be woken at 6am so we can start walking at 7am. 
Today was the Chairback range of mountains. So the whole day was climbing. The views are really rewarding. 
Because we had to pack for so many days (4) we packed light. In hindsight we may have packed a bit short on lunch and snacks. It is going to be a lean two days. We are getting a resupply on Monday, but till then we may be hungry. 
Today we saw our second moose. We both heard a noise that sounded like a grunt and 1 minute later saw the moose running through the forest. 
We met a hiker called Slack Rack. She got her trailname given to her when she hiked braless for a day. Another hiker saw this and gave her the trail name Slack Rack.","Long Pond Stream

Top of Kathadin mile 2190 
Miles walked 66.9  
Days walked 4 
On the 14 september at 9.47am I touched the board that marks the end of the north bounders hike. 2190 miles over 163 days. Myself and Dandelion started the walk on the 4th April in Springer Mountain. We walked through 14 states. We gained and lost elevation equivalent to climbing Mount Everest 17 times. We took more than 5 million steps. All this just to say I thru hiked the Appalachian trail. 
The last days before the summit had it's fair share of drama. 
I twisted my ankle again. This time I could not just walk it off and I limped on for a while in the pouring cold rain before deciding to take a zero at white house landing. You go to the jetty and radio for Bill to come and fetch you in his boat. He also gives each guest a complimentary weed cigarette (legal in Maine). No, I did not smoke it but gave it away to a thru hiker. We checked in and I spent the afternoon with my foot up. Supper was an amazing one pound burger with all the trappings. Really good, but I could have had another one. This hiker hunger is going to become a challenge in the coming days. 
On day 161, we saw Kathadin for the first time. A majestic, stand alone 5267 foot mountain. It was standing tall and proud on a beautiful sunny day. Calling out to the hikers to climb. It was just 15 miles away as the crow flies but at least 35 miles away via the trail. It would take us 2 days of twisting trail to get there. That night, we camped next to Rainbow Lake. Kathadin was hidden behind the mist but at 2 am the mist cleared and the mountain shone in the moonlight and the stars were reflected in the pond. The loons were calling. One of the best middle of the night toilet trips I have taken. 
Then on to Abol bridge which marks the end of the 100 mile wilderness and the start of Baxter State Park. We thought that was the end and it would be a short hike to the campsite. We ordered fried chicken and fish and chips and filled our stomachs. Then walked the 8 miles to the campsite. It was a long and hard 8 mile walk. 
We checked into the campground and got our permits to summit the next day. We were part of a group of 13 thru hikers who were summiting the next day. 
The sun was shining when we started our walk up. Like all climbs, it started gently and then got steeper as we climbed. The rocks got bigger until we were bouldering up the side of the mountain for at least 1 mile and then we reached the plateau and it was an easy walk up to the top and to touch the board. 
The 2190 mile journey was over. There were no tears or drama from any of the hikers. Just a quite feeling of satisfaction knowing the journey was complete. 
I am now an Appalachian Trail thru hiker. 
Thank you to 4th Quarter for the last 267 miles. 
This story would not be complete without highlighting the fact that Dandelion walked with me for 1900 miles and faced her biggest fear and walked the Whites and some of the big mountains in New Hampshire. She laid the foundation and the groundwork for me to finish this hike. I am very very grateful and proud of my wife, without her support and planning this journey would not have happened. Thank you Dandelion. Signed
