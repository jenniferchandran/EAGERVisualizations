Casket ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508894,"I have been reading about the Appalachain trail for a while now and decided I wanted to thru hike it. I have read many trail journals, and I know it will be extremely hard, and rewarding. I told my wife my plans about leaving for 4 months and she had me packed before I finished the sentence, and said see you in four months. I think she loves me and supports me?",,View Entry,"Aug 06, Thu",0
Casket ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509092,"My wife saw my packing list with an economy sized pack of condoms. I told her it was emergency dry bag's but she didn't buy it so now they are off my list of item's I am taking. Well my daughter has decided to go hiking with me but,(I think it was my wife's idea) she don't want to do a thru hike she wants to break it up into month long sections and do it over a few years. I said great. I really look forward to seeing the sun rise and set with my daughter over the course of a few years. We didn't really get along the best for a few years, (can you say teen age daughter) but now it is a joy to spend time with her.",,View Entry,"Aug 07, Fri",0
Casket ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509664,"I have started to gather some of the gear I need. I got my backpack, sleepingbag, water filter and bladder and headlamp. My wife suggested some NaCN pills for water purification and I told her I would stick with Aquamira tables for my backup but thanks for the advice.(Make's me nervous when she offer's help I don't know why.)
Well as I understand it you need 3 entry's before it goes online, so this should make it official. Me and my daughter have been talking we are thinking about going sometime in March to April to and just see how far we get is 30 days. We will do the approach trail.",,View Entry,"Aug 08, Sat",0
Casket ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518159,"After my daughter has had time to think about it, she decided she wanted to do shorter trips than a month at a time. I just can't do less than that. I know me I would loss my trail legs and have to start over every time. So I am deciding to make a go of it in 2018.",,View Entry,"Aug 09, Sun",0
