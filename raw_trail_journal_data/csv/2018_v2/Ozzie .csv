Ozzie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588575,"Made it to Hot Springs today.  This a hiker friendly town where they have hiker celebration days, an outfitter and a couple of hiker friendly restaurants.
Along the trail we now often see blooming rhododendrons and in another month we should start seeing more and more varied colors.  We are entering the ‘green tunnel’, as it is called.  At the beginning of the trail we hiked through forests with bare trees, no leaves yet.  As we hiked into North Carolina and the weather is warming, the forests and fields are becoming greener and lush.  All the blossoms are out and leaves are budding everywhere, flowers blooming.  Thus, the green tunnel refers to the trail changing to one with green leafed trees hanging overhead, wild flowers blooming along the trails.  With each turn we are seeing different aspects of spring and new signs of life, babbling streams and rapids coursing over rocks alongside the trail and lots and lots of wild flowers everywhere.  For the remainder of the hike we will likely mostly be walking through this green tunnel, until fall, when the green tunnel becomes a yellow/red or golden tunnel.  Looking forward to experiencing all of it.  
The Appalachian Trail goes right through Hot Springs and you can follow the white blazes on the street, utility poles, side walk and bridge railings. See photos! 
Now have completed abound 275 miles total.  On the way down the mountain towards town today,  we smelled and saw forest fire and fire fighters.  Helicopters were flying back and forth bringing large bags of water to douse the flames over a twenty acre area of what was mostly ground fires.  Luckily there was no wind and the fires were not raging fires. 
One of the firefighters accompanied us down the trail awhile to make sure we could get through that section safely.  By the time we reached the Hot Springs city limit the trail was blocked with orange cones and signs stating trail was closed due to fires.  By evening the helicopters had stopped carrying water bags to the fires and we hope they were able to stop the fires from progressing.
We ate at a nice restaurant that used to be a textile factory,  along the river and visited around town.  I had a great meal of meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy and a corn dish.  
The plan for tomorrow is to leave from French Broad River Bridge and hike to Spring Mountain Shelter. Had a great day today.","Garenflo Gap

We climbed for an elevation of 1307 ft to 3545 ft.  We were able to slack pack the first part of the day to Tanyard Gap where Brenda met us with our large packs.  After that we continued hiking with the big backpacks until we reached the shelter at night.
The walk along the river was lovely and the view as we climbed was lovely, including the river below as well as the green hills and valleys beyond.
We reached the shelter area at about 3 pm and decided to camp there for the night.
Tomorrow and the next day we plan to hike longer stretches and should have done over 300 miles by Friday.  At that time we will be heading into a town again.

I also met a sister and a brother who were hiking together from Kansan City, and Pensacola, FL who hike together for a week every year.  We decided to give them the trail names 'Hansel and Gretel' since they were a brother/ sister combination,  but Hansel did not like his name very well.  The next day we changed Hansels' name to Handsome, and he liked that little better so they are now Handsome and Gretl. 
On top of Roan Mountain is the highest shelter on the entire Appalachian trail.  The Cloudland Hotel used to exist in 1925 and people used to come with horses and buggies and spend a few days there, for various reasons, including to breathe the clean mountain air and get away from the smoky air of the city.  Wealthy people could get lodging and have meals there as well. 
Wander Woman has a satellite communication device which tracks altitude as well as average hiking speed. when she stops hiking it stops recording.

Still have not seen any bears but they are definitely in the area along the trail because we heard about several close encounters and incidents where bear activity have closed a camp sites.  Today we saw a note about a bear taking someone's food bag, where the person may not have hung their bag up adequately high enough according to the guidelines. This caused that campsite to be closed to hikers.  It is always recommended to have your food bags at least 8 feet up in the air and 100 feet from your tent.  Bears have an amazing sense of smell and can locate food scents from miles away.  
One of the hikers we spoke to today told us he had stopped on a spot to eat and saw a rattle snake.  He had heard rattles but did not realize that is what he heard.  Other hikers who met up with him said the snake they saw was 3 - 4 feet long .
Along the trails through the woods saw some beautiful pink Lady slippers !!  In Wisconsin we have some yellow ones, but I had never seen pink lady slippers before.  They are about the size of a grown mans' thumb and resemble an orchid and may be in the orchid family.  
There were golden orange azaleas by the hundreds as well as many other flowers in bloom.  
The weather was quite hot today and we were glad to get off the trail at about 1:30 pm where Floyd picked us up to take us back to Bristol to Commanders home for the night.  We started at 7:30 am today so we hiked 17 miles in about 6 hours.  We are averaging about 2- 2 1/2 miles an hour depending on the terrain.  We also take short breaks for water resupplying and to eat.

The river is very fast moving, carrying with it broken pieces of trees and turbid as it churns up the bottom and looks like brownish water with lots of debris from the natural environment. No boating in this river, due to the very fast flowing water.
I then followed a long stretch of the AT along the river before it turned across a road and back into the mountains. Did a 1000 foot ascent within a short distance then mostly hiked across the ridgetop with small ascents and descents the rest of the day.

Early on in today's hike we came by Washington Monument where we stopped and climbed up on the tower and enjoyed the views.  From the top of this tower you can see 3 states, including Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. 
There were some ascents and some very rocky sections which were harder to negotiate but from what we hear from other hikers the rocks in Pennsylvania are going to be much worse, more of them and with little or no place to find a level place in between them to put your feet.
Did not see much wildlife today ; met several other hikers, including quite a few section hikers going southbound.
We hiked through alot of woods and usual, as well as several pastures with cut hay, including a field where the trail ran through a lovely wild flower prairie.
At the place where the trail went across a road near this prairie field, we were surprised to find a young man with a cooler for of cold drinks, waiting for hikers to come out of the woods and give them some trail magic.  He was a hiker himself who was taking a day off and spending time with an uncle nearby.

We ate our packed lunches at a gravel road intersection.
After a few more climbs and descents we hiked through some muddy, marshy, boggy areas over planks and boards before reaching the end point of our hike today at Main Road near Tyringham.  Still have not been wearing my new shoes hoping to keep them clean longer but I will have to break them in pretty soon.

This was a long and difficult day including 3 mountain summits.  Lone Mountain, Horn mountain and Saddleback mountain (including Saddleback Junior).
We had great hiking weather and since it was Labor day weekend met many day hikers going either North or South Bound,","

Major milestone today was having reached and surpassed the 2000 mile mark!! We are getting alot closer to the end of this journey. Only 188 miles legt.

No photo or video can convey the truly extraordinary views from up on the summits. We went across South Horn first, followed by West Bigelow Peak and after another descent and ascent over Bigelow Avery Peak, and afterwards a notch went across Little Bigelow Mountain.This was an especially challenging day physically and emotionally but also our last big mountain before we reach the end at Mt Khatadin in a week or two.When we finally got to the endpoint for today there was a lot of trail magic set up by some wonderful trail angels / supporting hikers of the Appalachian Trail. Wel gratefully enjoyed pasta salad, sandwiches and cold drinks as was candy bars and fruit.Happy tired hikers. Harriet and I drove out in Brenda's Volvo back to the starting on Hwy 27. We washed up in the river near the trail and camped out in the parking lot.","Stratton pond

Ozzie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602277,"Enjoyed one of the easier hiking days thus far on the trail. No mountains to climb but a trail which was mostly covered with pine needles and leaves, whereas most of Maine would prove to involve lots of rocks and roots and mud to negotiate.
The day started off with trail magic again at the East Flagstaff Road including sausage and egg biscuits and powdered donuts plus candy bars. The same group of men who provided this magic the day prior had camped out overnight and were now cooking breakfast.
Saw beautiful ponds along with a loon in the last lake I hiked by.
Harriet hiked in again to meet me at the other end of the trail.","East Flagstaff road

Harriet hiked the first 3 miles in until the river crossing and took the pictures, then she hiked back as usual to drive and hike in to meet me at the other end of the hike for today.
Our hike included 2 smaller mountains which still were surprisingly challenging due to lots of small rocks.Stayed in our camping van in Bingham for the night after eating st a pizza restaurant where Ozzie enjoyed a great Calzone.","Otter pond road

Ozzie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602465,"This was a day many hikers await with eager anticipation, because it is the last stop before the 100 mile wilderness and then the endpoint, Mt Khatadin!!
We hiked a short distance of 6.3 miles where Harriet had hiked in 3 miles towards me. We hiked to the endpoint and then ate a little lunch at the General store, and walked across the road to the Maine ATC office. There we obtained alot of necessary info about the 100 mile wilderness and possible access roads in and out, maps, got reservations for the Khatadin campground and spend time organizing the next 6 or 7 days.
Harriet and I walked over to the Shaw hostel where we were unable to meet with Poet (the owner) because he was running a food drop to a hiker in the wilderness.
We did speak with Hippie chick (his wife) about the road Harriet can take into the wilderness tomorrow. Plan is for us to hike 17 miles tomorrow, Harriet hikes in from the endpoint in the woods where there is a gravel logging road taking a mile long access trail to the AT.  Then she could walk out with us and take Wander Woman and Commander to their non gravel road vehicles and we will camp out at a parking area just after the paved road starts.
Happy hikers!","Shirley Blanchard Road

A fairly easy hike with a water crossing whereby we all took our shoes off and waded thru calf highly water!
Most of the trail involved roots, rocks and more of both.  There were loons in the first lake we hiked by and Ozzie enjoyed hearing there ancient call.
Harriet hiked in about 3 miles from the endpoint and back with us to the Access trail to the van. We drove all the hikers in our group out to wherever Floyd and Brenda waited in their vehicles and we camped in the parking area where the gravel road started.","Hwy 15 Monson

On the way in I spotted 3 moose, a bull moose a mother moose and her young. They were browsing for food in a recently logged area with debris legt after harvested of logs.
Big milestone today of hiking over Whitecap Mountain with a spectacular view of Mt Khatadin from the summit. 
We also hiked over 3 other mountains today including Gulf Hagas, West and Hay mountain. 
The trail still consists of roots and rocks and lots of them with constant diligent eye on the ground to avoid tripping over the multiple tripping risks. 
We drove out the long gravel road (Jo Mary Rd) and stayed at the Wilderness Edge Campground in Miilinocket.","Khatadin Iron Works Road

I hiked by a lake and the views were worth stopping for.
Still negotiating roots and more rocks but I didn't fall.
Towards the Wadleigh Pond I was happy to see Harriet again who had hiked in about 3.5 miles and hiked over Mesabunte mountain then hiked back with me, climbing it again and enjoyed my first and fabulous view of Mt Khatadin from the trail. 
When I got back to the van I decided to hike the section from Pollywog stream as well so I had less miles to do the next day.
Harriet met me again on the way of this section and we took photos of Mt Khatadin from the top of Mesabunte mountain, across the long wilderness section

Harriet hiked with us again all the way and celebrated the moment on the summit by climbing the Katahdin summit sign with me for pictures!
We ate ate a quick lunch and started the long descent down again.
We had taken the Hunt trail (which is a AT trail up the mountain) and did the descent on Abol trail.
The ascent was more challenging and dicy at times due to the sheer vertical and more technical climbing.
Thankfully no one was injured and all made it to the top.
Enjoyed the journey from Georgia to Maine immensely in many ways. It has been immensely challenging physically but also very rewarding to know I was able to accomplish this.
Hope you have enjoyed sharing and following my journey by ways of this journal.  Thank you for your support and encouragement along the way.","Khatadin Stream campground
