Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600366,"Fun climb up a very rocky mountain!   Let me rephrase that, fun climb up but scary climb down and got many bruises and cuts.  Ate lunch at the top and watched about 10 NOBO finish their hike - loved feeling their excitement.  Even better got to go back to the hotel for a shower, real dinner with ice cold beer.  My pup isn't allowed in Baxter State Park which is the first 15 miles of the AT so Kel is staying with him in the hotel.   Something I forgot to mention, I did get lost coming down the mountain.  I was admiring the view and obviously could see the way down so I got off the path.  After taking a pic I looked up and followed the first white blaze I saw.  The path does go a little up and down in parts to make it easier but I did think I might be headed the wrong way.  Fortunately a guy was coming down and I asked him which way he was going.  He laughed and said down.  Ha ha.  Once I got to my car and headed out I realized I did not know which way to turn.  I got out of my car to ask the car coming in and then I see the nobo sitting on the side of the road.  Once again he laughed then asked if he could have a ride.  He hopped in and we laughed about my great sense of direction.  This was Tim's third thru hike once sobo and twice nobo.  He suggested two great stealth spots in the 100 mile wilderness.  He also made an awesome cold weather trick - carry a nalgene bottle and fill it with hot water before bedtime and sleep with it by your feet in the sleeping bag.","Katahdin Stream

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600567,"Great start with shuttles. I shuttled to katahdin stream and hiked the rest of the no dogs allowed part of the AT in Baxter State Park.  Realized when I got there I had forgotten my poles in Kels car.  Dummy but did find good sticks to use.  
Had some beautiful views.  Took a coffee break at toll dam a beautiful spot. Then came to little niagara falls which had rocks beat to look like waves (see pic).  Then big Niagara Falls.  Love walking by moving water!  
Kel drove to the end of the 100 mile wilderness and shuttled back to abol and met me at their restaurant right on trail.  She got there about 2 hours after me so I enjoyed a nice long lunch and break.  Originally we planned a 3 mile walk to the first shelter but was too early to stop. 
However when we were ready to stop couldn’t find any spots that weren’t taken for a good 2 hours.  Desperate at end to stop so decided to try the private campground.  (How can there be a private spot in the middle of the public ground.)  So beautiful!  But we were beat so set up quickly, ate and went to bed.  
Bad start to tenting for me though.  Didnt notice Rusty swimming and he came in the tent wet and sandy.   Ug!  Fortunately I brought a towel though.","Katahdin stream

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600568,"Beautiful morning! Sat in a lounge chair listening to birds looking out at the lakeI  Kel slept till after 9 so I had a great lazy mornings.  I can’t remember the last time I actually had a completely free morning with nothing I should be doing. 
The morning started with some really slippery muddy patches so we were even happier we stopped at the private site.  We would have had a very hard time last night being overtired and dark.   It was a pretty but muddy hike.  We appreciated all the stepping stones that had been put on the path.  As we were talking about it 2 people passed by and we told them how impressed we were by the maintainers of the path.  They happened to be volunteers so we got to thank them.  Also asked them how they actually moved the huge stepping stones - groups of 4 were needed.  What a great group!
We had thunderstorms and downpours off and on all day.  Poor rusty thinks that he needs to protect us from loud thunder so would run off barking at it.  I did put him on the leash for awhile so he didn’t run too much extra.
We learn new lunch gourmet from a nobo German hiker: tortillas, a block of cheese, pepperoni and thousand island dressing.  I appreciated learning that sharp block cheese does not need to be refrigerated.  He also said if his buddy wasn’t already named sticks that should be my name due to my stick poles.
Once again it was getting late and we were ready to stop.  We were hoping to find spots on top of the mountain and we found perfect spots.  Ended around 630 tonight so got to enjoy dinner overlooking katahdin.","Rainbow lake private beach

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600852,"Woke up to a beautiful sunrise over katahdin. Really enjoyed having service and catching up with people. I love hiking and having no schedule but definitely will miss Internet and tv. However the no schedule thing made a grumpy day of hiking as we didn’t get started hiking till 1045. I was suppose to wake Kel up at 9 but my phone died and i was enjoying stretching and just lounging and really had no idea of time. I’m quite good at doing nothing.Usually I assume 2 mph when backpacking but Maine is covered in roots, rocks, mud and water so we are much slower. The trail volunteers do a great job of laying down planks and stones but you really have to watch your step.Our first stop we made was at Nahmakanta lake to filter water. All of us wanted to swim but only rusty did. We decided our next stop for lunch would be a swimming stop but as we kept walking we realized we would be really late to our campsite. We only have food for 7 nights and there are no easy resupply places in the 100 mile wilderness so we do have to keep a schedule - bummer.It was a beautiful walk over looking lakes most of the time but still hard since we had to push. We did have a beautiful though brief stop at Pemadumcook lake and had the clearest view of Katahdin. We ended about 630 and stayed in our first designated campsite at the Potaywadjo Spring lean-to. It is a nice wooded campsite but there are other people here, we can’t see them but can hear them, so I have to really watch rusty so he doesn’t bark. We did have a nice night though looking at pics and deciding on a plan for tomorrow. I’m waking Kel at 730.Pretty sad but Rusty crawled in Kel's tent and really did not want to join me.  Kel's tent is smaller though so he should be with me plus I want him to be so I had to drag him out.","Nesuntabunt Mt

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600853,"This morning wasn’t nearly as relaxing as the others. I let rusty wander as usual but he heard people so started barking, when we are walking he never barks at people however once we claim our spot he thinks he has to guard it. Rusty ended up crawling in Kels tent. I woke both them at 8 and we started hiking around 845. Our first stop was Jo Mary lake to filter water. Next was Antlers campsite for coffee and a snack. That would have been a great place to camp.Kels feet were really bothering her so we stopped at footbridge to fix her blisters which were huge - 2 she popped and bandaged. I am really glad I switched to Saloman trail shoes though I do have a couple small blisters.I feel bad for Kel because she is really ready to be done and we are less then halfway. We have no service so there is no way out. She is being good about it but just expressing her feelings. She is finding it tedious which I do understand. I’ll find out next week when I’m alone if I really do love it but right now I think it’s great.We stopped at a great lean-to Cooper Book Falls and were tempted to stay there and swim under the falls however our plan was for a spot past Crawford pond that would be on the water too and most likely be private, A nobo told us about it. We did enjoy meeting the 3 people that were staying there though. 2 were already thru hikers and the other had gotten hurt last year and was finishing this year. The guy was a nobo 2013 and trying a Sobo this year - Yay another Sobo and only the 2nd I’ve met. The 2 woman were nobo and were enjoying finishing the rest of the one woman’s hike from last year. Their advice was don’t forget to have fun.Fortunately we moved on because this spot is great. We had planned on swimming but the water and air were cold so just took a quick dunk to clean off. It really made us feel better. We had a nice dinner on the beach but ended quickly with the rain. Hopefully the rain stops before we wake up. It is nice to fall asleep to though. This really would have been a great day if Kels feet weren’t hurting. I like our many breaks.","Potaywadjo Spring lean-to

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600854,"Since we went to bed so early I woke up around 3.  It was still raining so I read in my tent for a couple of hours then fell back asleep until 7.  It was still raining so for the first time ever we had to pack up in the rain - no fun at all.  Kel bandaged her blisters and put on dry socks but then had to put on her wet boots and wet clothes.  It rained on and off most of the day so her blistered feet were wet all day.  Fortunately Rusty does not mind the rain or walking through water.  This was our hardest day too with many climbs; the downhills are actually the hardest part especially on wet rocks.  About 3:30 we stopped at the Carl A Newhall Lean-to for a snack break and to filter to water.  We met a flip flopper Bee's Knees and 2 others that were doing the 100 mile wilderness.  Pretty funny but the 2 that were doing the 100 mile had met Kel and Rusty at Shaws where Kel got her shuttle. They were just talking about Rusty and were wondering how he was doing.  They were very happy to see him enjoying the hike.  I would have been happy to stop there but Kel wanted to get over the next mountain today instead of tomorrow morning which was smart.  We did get a great view of Katahdin from halfway up the White Cap Mt and then were in the clouds on top of the mountain which was pretty neat.  
Unfortunately the downhill was slippery so we were very slow.  We did get to see the sunset on Hay Mt but then had to use our headlamps for the last mile to Sidney Tappan Campsite. We needed water so could not stealth camp.  I thought night hiking would be fun but it isn't with Rusty because he barks at noises at night.  Like Kel said it is good if he scaring off an animal but its not when going into a camp with others already sleeping.  Once I put him on a leash he stopped however it made walking harder for me and unfortunately it was on a rocky decline.
We got to camp after 9 and then had to set up wet tents and eat dinner quietly since we had many other campers nearby and already sleeping.  Not a fun way to end the day but we actually set ourselves up mileage wise for a nice 3 day distance to end the 100 mile wilderness.  For some reason Kel could not get her tent to stand up right.  I offer to help but she said good enough and crawled in to sleep.  Actually the wet tents ended up being fine to sleep in.  Both of our sleeping bags were wet but still cozy.  Not sure what happens though when its raining during set up.",".1 miles past the access to Crawford pond

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600876,"Woke up this morning to everything still wet since it was a foggy night.  I did ask someone how to best deal with wet stuff and he said just pack it up and hope for a clear night to dry things up.  Kel's feet really look terrible but we have no service so really no way out - 37 miles to go.  She took care of her feet as best she could popping some and using moleskin.  Really an awful day for both of us.  She is in pain limping along and there is nothing I can do to help.  She now feels claustrophobic with the green tunnel trapping her inside and I feel like a drill sergeant.  Fortunately we have happy Rusty bouncing along looking back at us impatiently.  He surprised a hiker who was excited to see a fox until he realized it was a pup - part pom part fox!
We did take a nice break along side a running stream where Kel re-bandaged her blisters.  She did seem happier after that so I thought they felt better.  Then we got to a waterfall where the Gulf Hagas Trail intersects the AT.  Kel saw day hikers and realized she could get out.  She was so excited!!!
At first she was going to go alone and then meet me at the end of the 100 mile wilderness where we had hostel reservation for Tues and Weds night.  Instead I decided to go with her then she would bring me back to the parking lot Tues where I would then continue my hike and she would drive back to MD then FL.  I asked the first woman I saw if she could give us a ride until we could get service.  At first she looked surprised but then I explain to her that we were hiking the trail and Kel just needed to get off to take care of her feet.  As soon as she saw Kel feet she said poor baby and gave Kel some spray to help the pain.  We were so LUCKY!  They, Lindsey and Micky - mom and daughter,  were from Bangor ME and had came out here to hike the Gulf Hagas trail and just explore this area of Maine.  They take day trips with a destination in mind and then just decide where to go from there.  They have no definite schedule and just enjoy each others company.  Definitely fun caring family and really saved us.  They drove us directly to Shaw's Hikers Hostel where Kel had left her car.  All we did was say thank you.  I really wish I had gotten there full names and address but at the time was not thinking.  
Then we headed to the Lakeshore Lodge and Pub.  I hoped I could change my reservation to tonight and tomorrow but was unable to switch it.  We had driven through Greenville on our way to Shaw's so we headed back that way and found the beautiful Moose Mountain Inn.  We both took long wonderful showers and then headed to a sunset dinner at Kelly's Landing.  Had a great dinner and then watched TV in bed drinking Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc - such luxury!","Sidney Tappan Campsite

Rusty was very happy to lounge all day with Kel.  About noon we left the hotel to do laundry and get lunch.  The laundry mat was family run with twins and their mom and was really a fun vibe.  Really enjoyed bumming around the town while doing laundry.  Then spent the afternoon at the hotel before heading out to Stressfree Moose Pub and Cafe for a great dinner.  Back at the hotel enjoyed watching Rusty doing tricks and watching Bachelor in Paradise.","Moose Mountain Inn

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601210,"Kel dropped us off at the Gulf Hagas parking lot and Rusty and I started off.  Rusty trotted slowly behind me looking sad confused as to why we were not waiting for Kel.  It took a good 5 mins before he gave up and moved in front and looked happy.   
Perfect hiking weather.  Really enjoyed hiking today climbing many mountains and overlooking beautiful lakes.  Decided to stop for the night at what I thought was Long Pond Stream Lean-to at mile marker 99.4.   I changed my mind because it was a long hike down to get to it, my awol guide didn’t show tent sites and there was a stream coming up in a mile.    (My favorite camping spots are by running water.).   I get to the top of the Barren mountain in time to see the sunset - so beautiful.  ShaggyDog and Sally Forth were sitting up there admiring the view.  Shaggy Dog questions where I’m going since he had just come up the other way.   I told him I was going to stop at the last shelter but then decided to camp by the stream coming up.   He says the next spot is about 4 miles away down a huge steep decline.  He shows me his ap guthooks which shows the next water source.  I show him awol guide and he realizes I am completely wrong about where I am.  The lean to I just passed was Cloud Pond at the 95.4 mile marker.  Ug!  It was too late to go 4 miles so I head back with them to Cloud Pond.   We get there right when it’s getting dark so i get water, set my tent up and make dinner and eat in my tent.  Quiet hours are as soon as it gets dark.
In my tent thinking about the day I realized that means I averaged about 1mph today.  My normal backpacking speed is 2mph.  This terrain really is harder then anything I’ve done.  Worse is that because of my stupid mistake we got to camp too late and walked 2 extra miles.   I am getting guthooks next town day.   The positive was meeting great people.","Moose Mountain Inn

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601213,"I had a great night sleep even though I had set up beside the shelter.   It was drizzling so I had to pack up a wet tent again.  I did get started early around 7.  I always wake up before 6 so guess this will be my normal start time.   
It was foggy and rainy all day so I missed all the beautiful views.  You can’t wait till clear days to hike but I really hope to hit the best spots on a sunny day.   Hiking was fun in the morning but eventually things just became a muddy slippery mess.  There were many fords that were impossible to get through without splashing through the water.  Thru two I had to carry Rusty because they were knee deep and the current was rushing.  I switched to my crocs for them so I could keep my shoes semi dry.  It feels horrible sloshing around when your feet are soaked.   However about 2 I slipped on a rock and landed on my butt in the water.  Once again my backpack saved me from getting hurt but now it was halfway soaked too.  After that I just slogged through the fords without worrying about getting wet just making sure not to fall again.  
About 3 all I could think about was getting to the end of the 100 mile and going to a hostel for a hot shower.  I had about 8 miles to go then.   I must have fallen at least 10 times so I was a muddy mess.  Rusty had just slogged through the mud so he was a mess too.   
About 6 I realized I had no hope of making it to town so decided I would just stopped at the next water spot to get water for dinner and then stop at the next place I could set up my tent.  About 30 mins later I came to North Pond which was actually a great place to set up my tent too.   Also nice because I could clean up both myself and Rusty.  
Even though it was drizzling we got to see the sunset.  I took a picture but it didn’t come out.   We were exhausted and I was really looking forward to a great night sleep listening to the running water however Rusty popped my sleeping pad.  I tried to fix it but about 11 woke up to it flat.  I really didn’t sleep much after that.   I’m a baby and the ground is too hard for me.   
Tomorrow I plan to walk the remaining 4 miles and then head to town for a shower!  I’m really hoping the hostel has a private room for me but will deal with whatever.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601260,"Woke up to a beautiful crisp morning.  The tent actually dried last night in the wind though my clothes and shoes did not.    Love camping alone because I can let Rusty wander without worrying about him barking and he loves to explore in the morning.
Everything looks sparkling since it’s wet and the sun is shining.  It’s perfect hiking weather except that it’s still very slippery.  I started off not watching my step and fell hard on my elbow and got a big knot.   Oh well now I’ll just go slow and enjoy the view.   Less then 4 miles to walk to be done the wilderness and get to take a shower.  I still am looking forward to stopping at Shaw’s Hikers Hostel and getting everything cleaned up.  Also need to stop since it is known for the best breakfast on the trail.  
A poor kid I met 2 nights ago is hobbling along in tremendous pain from blisters.   He had bad blisters two nights ago then yesterday’s all day rain really messed him up.  I call Shaw’s Hiker Hostel for a shuttle and get picked up by a bus.  Poet drops off about 8 hikers and picks up 4 of us.   
Shaw’s is an awesome place!   We arrive and are immediately offered a beer or soda - a PBR at 1030am a great way to start a lazy day.  Poet looks at blister kids feet, Swiss Cheese, and decides he will need to go to an actual doc for treatment and antibiotics - so happy Kel found a way out!
We are greeted there by a beautiful Aussie pup and a group of hikers sitting around.   I was happy to see  2 that I had met 2 nights ago Andy who just started and Headbanger a flip flopper.  Hopefully I’ll see them some on the trail though they are faster.   
Poet and Hippie Chick own the hostel and were thru hikers in 2009.   They have an adorable son who fist bumps greetings to the hikers.   Fist bumping is the hikers greeting so germs aren’t passed.  Poet gives us a tour of the main house which has a kitchen, laundry, bathrooms and different size bedrooms.  There is also 2 addition houses with a tv room and bedrooms.  The bedrooms are singles, doubles and bunk rooms.   Rusty and I get a very comfortable single.  
I start sorting out my stuff.  I go to their supply store to get a spoon and ask about how to fix my pad since my duct tape method did not work.  Poet gave me a piece of tenacious tape.  It seems like it should work well.  And yes last night I enjoyed my freeze dried Shepard’s pie bag watching the sunset in the drizzly rain eating with my hands!    
There are loaner clothes here so that after showering you can wear their clothes and wash all your smelly stuff.  I picked bright blue tee and sweats and was so comfy.  I threw my load in with 3 other hikers - it’s funny how normal it seems with strangers.  Hikers really are a team and Poet and Hippie Chick really have set their place up to encourage it.  
While laundry was going I stopped in the deli down the road and asked if they had readers.  (Yes I lost my glasses already but I did have my mini backup pair fortunately.)   The woman at the counter gave my her old pair - so nice!   I still don’t have hiker hunger but I was excited to eat real food and got a great panini.
After lunch I sat around talking with the other hikers and Rusty went up to bed.  (We had laid down on our bed for a min and I had not yet put any of my stuff in the room but he knew it was his bed smart pup.)  The doors in the place are left open to air out the place which was great for Rusty.    I did go up for a couple hours to write my blog, catch up on my phone and pack my bag.  I went down to brush Rusty before dinner.  He has an undercoat that needs to be brushed at least once a week or he’ll get painful knots.  Then sat back with the group of hikers making dinner plans.  Fluff had just bought a bottle of bourbon and was passing that around - yum!  Fluff was a nobo all the way to Maine but then was offered a job on a sailboat for that sounded fun so he took it.  Now he’s doing the 100 mile then going back to the sailing job.  He’ll fit the rest of Maine in on his breaks.  What a fun life style!That night we went to dinner at the Lakeshore House Lodge andPub.  On the 1/4 mile walk there a nobo offers of a Budweiser from his 12 pack.  I said we’re going next door for food and beer.  Everyone else took one and he smiles and says one for the walk so I took one too and we popped them there.  Love walking down the street drinking beer!
The Lakeshore House was a beautiful waterfront friendly place and also owned be a thru hiker.  She even brought us blankets when it got cold.   Yay we got trail names Dorothy and Toto.    
When we got back to Shaws there was a fire going.  About 9 it was bedtime and I was sound asleep from 10-5.","North Pond

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601619,"Woke up,  packed up my bag and joined the many other hikers outside waiting for breakfast.  At 7 breakfast started being served.   You had your choice of how you wanted your eggs.  I was in the last group but when the server came in the room with eggs over easy and no one claimed them I said I’d love to take them so she gave them to me.  The plate consisted of 3 eggs, 3 strips of bacon and a massive amount of hash browns - yum!   And there were pitchers of OJ and coffee.   Next came the best blueberry pancakes which were all you can eat.  My hiker hunger has not kicked in but I did have 1.    Perfect way to start a hiking day.    
Next Poet started shuttling hikers to the trail.  I was ready but he could only take 7 per load so i got on the 2nd shuttle.  Poet dropped us off with info on the up coming hike and a great haiku which i will look up when I get service.  My hike should be easy for the next 50 miles but then I’ll hit southern Maine and New Hampshire which are the hardest sections on the trail.  
Today’s hike was much easier;  I didn’t fall once though i did bang up both shins on rocks.   There were 3 fordings where I had to switch to crocs.   The current wasn’t too strong though so Rusty could swim across.  Also nice spots for long breaks.   
I did buy the guthooks ap last night but could not figure out how to use it.  Fortunately a trail runner came along and set it up for me.   He had done the trail last year and plans to do the PCT next year.  I didn’t need it today but really wanted it just in case.
I got to the lean-to right at dinner time and there were 5 other hikers sitting at the table making dinner.  Love that this lean to has a picnic table.   Bees knees, who I had met a couple days ago, was happy to see Rusty which made me feel great since not everyone thinks dogs should be on the trail - the dummies.    I set my tent up, got water and then joined them.  All were making different crazy meals which is really fun for me to see.   I had a boring but good mountain house freeze dried meal.
Rusty wanted to go to bed and since I’m afraid he’ll pop my pad again I went with him.  I start writing this but hear the boys talking about how beautiful the moon is so have to join them.  I’m so glad I did because it was an orange full moon reflecting over the pond.  Also there were frogs all over which were fun to see.

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601621,"Woke to the boys joking in the shelter which was nice since they remind me of Dan and his gang though that happened when coming in at night.
I started off hiking around 7.  Once again a great day for hiking though a bit warm for Rusty.   He cools off by laying in the streams which is very cute.  We had some great Mountain View’s and some nice piney green tunnels that smell like Christmas.  There were some places I had to pick Rusty up because they were too steep and high to climb.  He’s really good at figuring out how to scale things but some places were just too hard.   
For my coffee/lunch break I stopped at a tiny dock on Moxie Pond.  I smelled so I cleaned my shirt there too.  Actually felt great putting the damp cool shirt back on though the smell did come back as I sweated through the climbs.  It is gross but I was told I will get use to it.  Also antiperspirant is a chemical we shouldn’t be using.   Ha!   And I use to think that about Deet however 3 days now I’ve used it.  The bugs really haven’t been bad though just those few spots.  However there have been annoying nats that love to fly by in your eyes and ears.  
I saw my first snake today; just a little one but fun to see.  There are frogs all over the path tiny and large.   They aren’t really afraid of you unless your feet or poles come close.   There are a ton of little squirrels about a third the size of the MD grey ones.  They yell loudly at you when you come close.   They are not afraid of people either though do run from Rusty then yell at him from a tree.  They are really cute.  I’ve also seen a few chipmunks.
It was fun seeing Bee Knees and the boys at various spots today.  They showed me the really low blueberry bushes - yum!  Rusty likes them too.  They are much faster then I am so I probably won’t see them much though.
We also met 2 nobo pups on the trail today.  The first was a beautiful Shepard.  They said he was doing great but had a hard time at first because he was use to sleeping 18hrs a day.  That is probably an issue with Rusty too but he is definitely enjoying the hike.   The other dog was a terrier about Rusty’s size.  He’s only issues were in the White’s.  He scrapped the fronts of his paws when pulling himself up over boulders.  His gang was funny.  We met them when they were cooking with a frying pan and sitting in camp chairs.  They don’t worry about how much weight they carry and they cook great meals.   Steak that’s vacuum sealed can last for 3 days not refrigerated.  They were really enjoying their hike.  
Ended up finding a great camping spot by Holly Brook.  Excited to be going to sleep with the sound of running water.  Also it’s just 8 and I’m laying in my tent writing this ready for sleep.  I have no service though so posting late.","Moxie Bald Mt lean-to

The hike was beautiful today going by waterfalls and lakes and really nice terrain until the last 2 miles which went back to the roots, rocks and mud.  It was really tough mentally and physically ending like that but fortunately ended around 5 for a nice relaxing night.  A couple other section hikers are here and it’s great to talk to them because they’re more my speed.  Also loved Pete’s attitude about Rusty  barking when he came near my tent - he should bark he is protecting you.  Thanks!!!

I stopped about .4 miles down at Avery campsite.   There are about 6 other campers here but it’s nice cause all the spots are at least 25yds apart and you cannot see them though you can hear them.  Once again 7 is quiet time since a lot go to sleep then.  I’m now sleeping from 8-5 though get up in the middle of the night to write this.  I don’t have the running water to put me to sleep tonight but do have the wind.","West Carry Pond lean-to

We got to the Bigelow west peak and when we got above tree line the wind was howling and hard to walk in.  There was about a 25yd ridge walk that would have been beautiful but more scary/thrilling in the wind.  I was definitely glad to go back below tree line.  The walk today was mostly downhill but, because everything was wet, was a slow walk.  A couple of really rocky places I had to pick Rusty up.  
We finally got to the road ME 27 and I called for a shuttle to the Statton Hostel.    My phone call was broken up so I called back and left a message.  Within a couple minutes a shuttle arrived but was full; however, he was coming back to pick up two more nobo hikers and I could catch a ride then.  I moved over to sit with them and found out we were actually headed to a new hostel, Hostel of Maine.  
What a beautiful place!   Once again greeted by a great dog Zoey.  This place is run to be kept clean.  Shoes and backpacks stay outside. Then you check in on the deck through an open window.  Melody gives you a landry bag. They have loaner clothes so you can clean everything.  Love their delousing system.     Also they have a nice restocking store where I buy my first ramon bomb concoction.  They also have a great selection of beer.
For dinner they do takeout but everyone eats together in their kitchen.  After dinner we all enjoy their beautiful porch.","Avery memorial campsite

Met up with Bees Knees again as she sped by me.  She hurt her knee falling so took a couple of easy days.  It fun running into people again.  It was a nice easy start to our walk even though it was uphill because it was in a nice piney trail.  However when we got to the top of North Crocker there was no view.  We were surrounded by trees still which was a bummer.
Then the climb down that was a rock scramble which was difficult.  The climb up to see South Crocker was tough but had awesome views.  The descent down was boulder climbing too however a gorgeous view.  It was so hard to pay attention to where you were stepping but necessary.  Anyone who has driven with me knows it’s not a good situation though we did make it through.  I did have to carry Rusty in spots and I always watched my feet then.  
I was planning on making it to the next lean to but once again overestimated my abilities and fell 3 miles short.  My feet were hurting today and I realized I never stopped to soak my feet in cold water.  Which Way and Next Step, bloggers that I’ve been following,  recommend soaking your feet in cold water partway through the day to prevent problems and I have been doing that during coffee or lunch break.  It really works.Fortunately I found a beautiful spot right beside the Sugarloaf Mt view point and stopped there because the thunderstorm hit right after I set up.  So we ate in the tent.   Fortunately Rusty stopped barking at the thunder once we got in the tent.

Stopped for lunch at the Orbeton Stream ford to soak my feet and eat my first Ramon bomb Ramon and tuna.  Pretty tasty.  I’ve run out of most snack food since last night I was in my tent so long that I had to try my my snacks that I hadn’t had in ages: oatmeal cream pie, payday, snickers and a different flavor Kind bar.  I am going to the Hikers Hut Hostel tomorrow to pick up my mail drop but forgot that I did still needed 2 days of breakfast and snacks.  
Passed Pappy on my way up Saddleback Jr mt where the terrain had just started to get hard.  Pappy is thru hiking the AT again at age 87!  He has a buddy with him that had thru hiked before with him but is only doing part of it now.  From then on today the terrain was hard and Pappy was my motivation.  Saddleback Jr was beautiful and had a great ridge walk though a very hard descent.  The weather looked stormy off in the distance but above us the sun kept peeking out.   The descent was rocky and difficult and I got chilly because I was moving so slow.  As soon as I got to camp I set my tent up, ate then crawled under my quilt with Rusty snuggled up beside me.  I feel bone chilled now in need of a hot shower and red wine!   However my quilt and Rusty will have to do.","Sugarloaf mt

Hard climb up Saddleback Mt though with fresh legs felt great.   Once we got to the top you could see the path for at least a mile and it was stunning.  I love ridge walking and it was a perfect day for it!  There were some hard ascents and descents and in one place they put a steel ladder to help.  It really was fun climbing though because it felt like wonderland.  I did have to carry Rusty some and he’s really funny about it.  He does not like help and is proud of himself for figuring things out.  If I stop to help and he doesn’t want it he backs up and gives me a look.   Once I continue on he walks around trying to figure out the best way and then does it.  Then he trots in front of me proudly.  So cute!  Times where he knows he needs help he waits for me.  I’m really impressed by his abilities but was told he does have 4 legs.   
The last couple miles of the day were nice an easy.  We got to ME 4 Rangeley and there was a sign directing you to The Hiker Hut just .3 miles down the road.  Pretty funny but it was nice walking on the road.  
The Hiker Hut is awesome!  There are veggie plants and flower plants everywhere and pet chipmunks.  Once again we were greeted with a Pbr and this time a plate of chips and salsa.   I also got my dropbox and gave Rusty his food and a treat.   
My cabin is right beside a stream.  It is 3 sided with the opening stream side.  There’s a bug net surrounding the bed though not necessary today.  The propane run outside hot shower is beside the stream too and is perfect.  This is really set up to enjoy nature and the owners are awesome.  
We went to town to recharge our electronics, eat dinner and stop at the grocery store.  I wore my beautiful loaner clothes that are so comfy though make me look strange: xl green t, red basketball shorts and my orange crocs.  Sorry all but that will be what I’m wearing when I get done with my hike - I really miss cotton and baggy clothes.  I definitely over stocked at the grocery store but it was a fun.
We came back to the Hikers Hut to a great fire, real popcorn, and another PBR.   Met a sobo, Moneypenny, but she is staying at the Hikers Hut waiting on a delivery.  Hopefully I will see her later on the trail.  The other 3 were nobo and told great stories.   Still I had to go to bed around 9.","Redington Stream campsite

They were really nice and drove me the .3 miles back to the start.  They did not want Rusty to have to walk on the road - really considerate people!
I was suppose to have a nice easy day.  Elevation wise it was however trying to avoid the mud was extremely annoying.  When you stepped in it it would suck your shoes partway off and the mud would ooze in your shoes.  Poor Rusty ended up getting sucked in chest deep.  He did not like it at all.  When we got to Moxie Pond I washed him off the best I could.  He happily rolled around in the leaves after that.
About a mile after that I was still annoyed with the mud when I saw a moose.  It was about 20 yards in front of me.  I quickly put Rusty on a leash and grabbed a cheese stick to distract  him.  We watched her for a good 10 mins eating leaves and slowly moving across the trail.  She did see us but she didn’t seem to care.  She knew it was her territory.  We waited until she moved off the path before continuing our walk.  And the evil mud was forgotten!
Met a nobo who had hiked in crocs since GA.  This is only his 3rd pair.  Most hikers go through at least 4 pairs of hiking shoes.   Also written on his crocs “no sleep til Katahdin.”
Had a beautiful view coming toward ME 17.  Crossed the road and started talking to 3 nobo who were happily munching on brownies.  They pointed out the bag of brownies that was left for hikers.   I looked kind of hesitant and they said don’t worry the note says no nuts no pot.  Then they said if someone one stops and offers you a cupcake take it. Different sort of reality when you’re hiking.  I laughed and took one - yum!  My first trail magic!   
We exchanged trail names and Oops was the girls name.   She had earned that nickname in GA.  It was freezing out and her guy was setting their tent up.  She tries to help but ends of kicking her sleeping bag down the hill into a pond.  She goes in the freezing water to retrieve it before it sinks.  Now all her clothes are wet and she starts crying.  She tells her guy she’s afraid she’ll ruin his hike.  Somehow he comforts her and they make it through that freezing night.  Now they have around 200 miles left.  Unbelievable and now my favorite couple story!
At the end of the day I was deciding if I needed to change into my crocs to ford Bemis stream when a northbound hiker tried to rock hop across.  She, Karen,  did change her mind though when I told her the campsite was on the south side of the stream.   We ended up camping together and had an enjoyable night.  She is a section hiker and has done almost everything between Conn and ME.  She is now doing the little parts she missed.  She is from Conn so hopefully when I get down there we can hike some together.  She didn’t bring her dog this time but usually does.  She does drink out of her dog’s bowl though so Rusty decided he could too.  His reaction was pretty funny when she said no.","The Hikers Hut

I got to the campsite around 4 and was greeted with hey Rusty.   2 of the boys I met on orange moon night were here.  
I quickly set up because it was thundering.  Fortunately it didn’t start til 530 and I had already eaten dinner and was ready for it.  Another early night in my tent which really is good for Rusty.  Though I’m bummed there is no service.  It’s hard to stay in your tent that long though it is fun to hear the storm right on top of you.  It’s amazing how our tents can withstand such a downpour.  
I really wanted the rain to hold off til I got through ME.  Blue Butterfly, a section hiker who is finishing this year, misstepped around this section and ended up in the black mud to her waist.  Also there are warnings not to try to climb the next mountain Baldpate when it’s raining or wet since it’s bare rock face.   Hopefully the rain stops soon and the winds dry it quickly.","Moody Mt

The sun came out and we got a beautiful view off Old Speck.  The climb down was open and awesome.  We stopped at Speck Pond to enjoy a snack before the Mahoosuc Arm which is known as a tough steep decline for sobos and it was very tough for me.  I misstepped and somehow I flipped and landed on my back with my head snapping back into my backpack.  It was such a weird feeling but as a moved everything I realized I was fine except for tweaking my knee.  Once again my backpack saved me.  I know I’m not the only one who falls a lot.  I feel such a warmth in nature.

We stopped after it was over at the next mt summit Fulling Mill and laid in the sun and had lunch.  Fortunately it’s easy to change Rusty’s mood and mine too.  It was very peaceful which we needed.

We hit the ME/NH border - 281.8 miles!   We headed up Mt Success but it started raining so we had no view.  We also had a hard time following the path.  Fortunately a nobo came up so I headed towards her.  
After about an hour of rain I started to get chilled.  I planned to stop at the next shelter for a coffee break but then came upon a stream so stopped right there.  It was only drizzling so I filtered water, towel dried Rusty and put my raincoat on.  I fed Rusty and made a hot cup of coffee and enjoyed it with spoonfuls of Nutella.   It really made me feel better.
The rest of the walk was very enjoyable - a nice easy path with some steep but not long inclines and declines.  Part of the path was extremely bouncy and wonderful then I came to the NH trail team and they were chopping roots out of the trail - so nice!   
I stopped again at Wocket Ledge for a snack and to enjoy the sun and my first view of the Whites and to try and dry my socks out.  It looked like another thunderstorm was coming in so I stopped at the first camp spot with water Page Pond.  I set my tent up first then cleaned Rusty and myself as best I could in the pond.  Then the sun came back out and we enjoyed the early night.  It really is a beautiful spot.  Once again I was running low of food so I had a tuna packet, a granola bar and spoonfuls of Nutella.  I do need to remember to add more food next time I restock.  Hiker hunger is real but I do hear it does level out as your body gets use to all day walking.

We got to the shelter around 4 and checked in with the caretaker.  In the Whites you have to pay to camp though only $10.  If you are a thruhiker you get a savings card so every other time you camp is only $5 and you get 1 free soup and 2 free baked goods at their huts which are on some of the popular mountains.   The huts have bunks but no electricity and cost over $100 a night and sell out.
There are also rules at these campsites/shelters to try to minimized bear problems:  cook and eat in a designated spot and  store all food in their bear boxes.  The designated dinner spot was nice because I saw 2 people I hadn’t seen in awhile, BeesKnees and Tyler,  and I met a bunch a other hikers.  One hiker had hiked with her pup since GA but he just cut his paw on MT Washington.  He is now out for a couple of days so it can heal.  Mt Washington has coral like rocks that are extremely sharp.  They had been using mushers wax too.

We started with a nice ascent to Mt Madison.  Once again I started thinking how much nicer the paths are in NH.  Then we got above tree line and the rocks started and continued for the rest of the day.  You had to constantly watch your step and even then be aware of loose rocks.  The walk over Madison was not bad though, because it was extremely foggy, I kept thinking we had reached the summit.  When we finally did and started walking down,  the sun came out for a bit and we had some great views.  We got to Madison Hut at lunch time and enjoyed Pumpkin curry soup, bread and an oatmeal chia cookie.   
At noon we started up Mt Washington and back in the rocks.  Some type of little animal started playing peekaboo with Rusty.  It made a chirp sound and Rusty would look them it would disappear and reappear somewhere else and chirp again.  It was really cute and I did include a picture.

It really put me in a weird funk no idea of time just watching my feet and hoping for sun.   It was 5 when we finally submitted Mt Washington and there was no one else up there.  So the one good thing was we were able to take a pic with the sign and not have to wait in the normal crazy line.  We did hear the train but did not see it.

Instead we headed to Mizpah Spring hut.  It was a nice mountain top walk in and out of clouds.  Had a great lunch at the hut then headed up Mt Jackson then to Mt Webster.  Mt Webster was beautiful!   We had great views of all the mountains we have just walked.  We could see most of Mt Washington though a Cloud was covering the top.  We then did fun switchbacks down the side of Mt Webster with great views.  Really an awesome day hiking until the last 3 downhill miles which really hurt my knees.  I during that part I fell and decided it was time for a snack so I sat right there and grabbed a snack for us.

Then my really hike started again - back to scrambling and steep inclines and declines but with that great views!   It was actually a full day without clouds and we could see Mt Washington clearly numerous times.  It was a perfect weather day. 
I read about a stealth spot on top of South Twin Mt so brought plenty of water up but the spot was too small for my tiny two person tent.  It was a bummer because it was beautiful up there and the sunset and sunrise would have been fun.  I was hoping to find a bigger spot quickly since it was already after 5, I was tired and it was a steep decline.   It did take over a mile but I found a nice spot.  Set up and made dinner and enjoyed sitting down.
Since I was running low on food again, I planned Sun to do a short hike to Crawford Notch and get a hotel room for the night so I could shower, do laundry,  resupply, and watch football all day.  However I was informed that a storm was coming in Mon night and lasting through weds night so I had to change my fun plan.   Now I’m finishing the Whites Mon and then staying at a hostel.  A nobo that hiked with his dog warned  me about how tough Mt Moosilauke, the last mountain in the Whites, is with dogs.  The positive is after that we should have no real tough spots.  But the change of plans is hard on me cause I stink, need a shower, need clean clothes and now have to ration food, make 2 days worth become 3, ug!","

We climbed down Garfield and then climbed up Mt Lafayette.  Then we had a mountain top walk to Mt Lincoln and Little Haystack.  It was mobbed the whole ridge walk with people and dogs enjoying the beautiful summer like day.  It was fun to see though made me very aware that I need a shower!   Also we were in the sun all day so it was too hot for Rusty and we took many breaks for water and shade.
Pretty funny, I started singing Sound of Music songs when we got to the top since it reminded me of the Alps.  About a mile into the ridge walk I passed a group of nuns in full attire.  And don’t worry I wasn’t singing a out loud when people were near!
I saw BeesKnees again at the Liberty Spring Campsite cutoff.  She had twisted her ankle badly and now was waiting on the owner, also a thruhiker, of the Notch hostel to hike up, give her an air cast, then take her backpack and help her hike to his shuttle.  People really go out of there way to help other hikers.  When BeesKnees fell, 2 woman came over to her and wrapped her ankle.  Then a couple helped her back down to the campsite cutoff.  The guy took her backpack and the girl carried hers and the guys backpack so BeesKnees did not have to carry additional weight.   When I saw BeesKnees at the cutoff we started talking about how great everyone treated each other.  We also talked about how we were trying to finish the Whites before the storm.  I mentioned that I changed my plans and now was rationing food so I would not have to stop to resupply.  BeesKnees gave me plenty of additional food so now I don’t have to ration.  She also told me never to ration just ask for help - most people carry extra.  I ate a pop tart right there and I really felt better.  It  really helped me finish the 14 miles I had planned.   Now I have 25 left to do by Mon night.

The huts are spaced out right by the trail in the Whites and I love having them.  All the people that work there are very friendly and knowledgeable so great to talk with.  I also love that they post the weather since service has been so hard to get.  I will miss them!  
Then we head up Mt Kinsman.  From the hut it looked clear but then the clouds came until we hit South Kinsman.  Then the skies cleared up and we had beautiful views.  Once again though it was a steep climb, the trail was wider and more groomed then trails in Maine.  However coming down South Kinsman was tough.  Back to narrow trails and less stairs and ladders to help.   
We had a beautiful almost mile walk by Eliza Brook.  Eliza Brook had waterfalls all through it and was really fun to hear and see.  Then we went back up Mt Wolf.  I was ready to stop for the day but the water source I was planning on using was a puddle.  I finally found a slow moving stream I could get enough water out of to make dinner.  I stopped at the next spot which had a nice view of the tops of the mountains and the sky.  We had a nice dinner of rice, instant potatoes and tuna. 
Also I have service!  Tomorrow I am staying at a hostel that has bunk rooms but Tues I am staying at Woodstock Brewery!  It’s fun to stay in hostels and talk to all the other hikers but Rusty really needs a day to sleep all day.  He cannot relax the same in hostels because there is too much going on.  Also brewery yum!  And it’s for my mom’s birthday!","

We started with a nice downhill walk to NH 112.  It was nice that trail parking had a trash can and bathroom.  Love being able to get rid of all my trash and use an actual bathroom.  Then the climb of Mt Moosilauke started.  It was a tough 1.5 mile steep climb beside a beautiful waterfall.  I really was happy to be going up; going down would have been scary.
After that we had a beautiful walk on the top.  It was sad to hear a nobo say that this was his first long ridge walk since that means it will be my last.  I really love the Whites!   Also this is the last mountain over 4000 feet until VA that is actually on the AT.  
After that we had around a 4 mile downhill walk to the hostel.  
My knees were hurting but I tried hard to keep a fast pace so I could get clean!   Checked into the hostel around 2, hung my wet tent, borrowed loaner clothes, took a shower and then started laundry while Rusty napped in the shade.  Then I picked up my drop boxes and gave Rusty treats - thanks!!!  Repacked my bag and now am laying in my comfy bed while Rusty naps.  
At 5:30 the hostel shuttled us to a resupply store that had very little though did have a nice NH Smuttynose IPA.  I was excited about getting a salad and sub but the closest I could get was a turkey and cheese sub.   Fortunately I was eating with a couple, Austin and Wizard, that bought a jar of sandwich sliced pickles and shared so that I did get something green!
Scary night for me though.  I went to pick Rusty up and trip and fell into the fire pit.  Fortunately we were fine though Rusty did have sparks in his hair.  My reaction was just to lay there and get the sparks off Rusty.  Fortunately Wizard grabbed me and pulled us completely away.  Very scary - thanks Wizard!","Near Dilly Cliff trail

We then wandered around Woodstock just enjoying the small town look and feel.  We ended up back at the brewery for acouple of great beers and conversation.  I showed him the picture of the critter that was playing with Rusty on Mt Washington and he told me it was a weasel which is a predator.  I guess I shouldnt have been happy watching. It’s amazing how quickly you can bond to someone through the hiking adventure.  His ride texted him she was coming so we went back to my room and he offered me his extra trail food which I gladly took.  I’m definitely starting with a heavy pack but I will not run out.  
Then Rusty and I laid around watching TV and updating my blog.  At 4 I went to enjoy happy hour and half price apps.  When I got back to my room, Rusty was actually ready for a walk so we wandered around the town.  About 8 I went back with Rusty to order a takeout burger.  I really love this place and all their interesting beers.","Hikers Welcome Hostel

My shuttle took me back to the Hikers Welcome Hostel where I made pb&j and peanut m&m sandwiches with the homemade bread Woodstock included with breakfast.  Then I started my hike.  Actually was a hard hiking day for me even though the weather was perfect.  For some reason my legs were still tired.  I really expected to feel fresh from the zero but oh well.  
The hike was mostly in the green tunnel however the leaves are changing and the woods smell great.  We did come to a great view off Mt Mist where we took a break and ate our sandwiches.  Of course that was only after 2 miles of hiking.  I was hoping it would give me more energy but nope.  
We had a long but not steep climb up Mt Cube where we had beautiful views.   We had gotten water before the climb so we could camp on top of the Mt.  We found a nice spot shortly after the summit.  We set up and enjoyed a nice early night.  I fell asleep by 8 but woke up around 11 to write this.  I really enjoy this schedule!  When I first got in my tent I was chilled so kept my long pants and long sleeves on but when I woke up at 11 it had gotten warmer so switched to just a tee.  The weather seems to switch quickly here though maybe its because I’m always in it now.","Woodstock Inn & Brewery

I’ve met Imua before.  He’s doing the hike for a fundraiser against trafficking in Thailand https://www.trekkingagainsttrafficking.com/.   He’s a really great interesting person. 
Both were planning on meeting friends at Dartmouth and taking a zero.   It seemed too far for me but they said it was an easy path.  They actually were right so I made it too.  
The trail goes right through Dartmouth sports fields and there is a campsite right before the fields in the woods.  First I saw the Dartmouth’s ski team running up the AT mt.  Half were loving it and some were doing it knowing it was good for them.  Really fun feeling their vibe.
Also big treat, there is a grocery store right beside the fields!  So first we stopped at the store for a big salad, a sub, wine and meatballs for Rusty.  I also got a yogurt, granola and fruit thing for morning.  
Then we walked back through the fields and set up camp.  We ate dinner listening to soccer practice.  We also met probably the last 2 nobos, Beans and Gucci, who are camped here too.  I told them Katahdin moved their close date back a week till Oct 22.  They looked at each other and said zero then?   They loved the town and are really enjoying the hike.  Beans has the best hammock setup I’ve seen so I included that pic.  He also shared some bourbon.  Really a nice night!  Looking forward to seeing the town tomorrow.","Just past Holts Ledge

Liminal was a couple miles ahead of me so we planned on meeting at Tigertown road.  I stuck a bunch of stuff in their car and headed to Ramuntos for the free pizza slice for thru hikers and Stoneface IPA yum!
It really was fun having the trail go through town. Dartmouth has a beautiful campus.   The trail then went over a bridge to Vermont and another fun little town.  The trail went over 3 miles on the street which was really a nice change though Rusty was a little slow sniffing every scent and adding to it.  Then we went into the Vermont woods which was a nice easy trail through tall pine trees.  
They picked me up at 4 and we headed to their campsite at Quechee Gorge State Park.  They had an awesome spread of food and cooked with a nice stove - the convenience of car camping!  Andy made chili and sweet potatoes for dinner and had Vermont Long Trail beers; the Maple Porter and a Red Ale were great.  We also had a great fire.   
Rusty though hurt his paw.  He was really tired today though too.  The previous 2 days he had been really chasing the squirrels.  Today we didn’t see any when hiking but when we got to the campsite he went in the tent as soon as I set it up even though we were making dinner.  Then he darted out of the tent when he heard the squirrel chirp and came back limping.  I felt his paw and leg and he did not flinch at all so I’m hoping it’s nothing serious.  Andy wasn’t planning on hiking tomorrow so he offered to watch Rusty - thanks!!!   Hopefully he needs just a day of rest.

We met Andy and Rusty at the end around 6 and he had hot beef stew and rice waiting for us - yum!   He had also bought farmers market apples which I enjoyed with peanut butter.  Then we drove to pick up Liminal’s car.  On the way we stopped at a convenience store for Whoopie pies, a northern thing cake sandwich with frosting in between, and bacon and eggs for tomorrow morning breakfast.  After picking up Liminal’s car we stopped at another convenience store to use the bathrooms and fill our water bottles.  They had maple whoopie pies so I got one of those and that was even better!  Love this kind of hiking though it does lead to late nights.  We did not get to our campsite which is a field by the AT parking lot until 9.

The drive to the start was tough since Stony Brook Rd is a gravel road.  I had to move a tree that had fallen in the road then came to a huge puddle that covered the whole road.  I was afraid to drive through that so backed up and parked at a camping site I saw that was about 1/4 mile from the AT.  I’m using that as my excuse for going the wrong way though really I know better.
Rusty really enjoyed the hike today too though fortunately there were no loud red squirrels.   It was great terrain again.  In the one spot that would have been a challenging climb, there was a ladder that was tied to the hill.  I did carry Rusty over that since it was straight up and down.  He’s good with ladders that are angled more.

I threw all my stuff in her car and took my tent down while Rusty sat in the passengers seat.  Since we were only going 5.5 miles I didn’t bring anything with me.  When I was ready Rusty just glared at me not wanting to leave his comfy car.  I picked him up and carried him to the path.  Poor baby I wish he understood it would only be a couple hours in the rain.  He did drag behind me for the first mile but then caught up.  It actually was a fun day once I gave up trying to avoid mud.  That happen after I fell and got my whole side completely muddy.  The evergreen smell really came out in the rain too which was nice.  We came to the Bromley Mt Ski slope and then jogged down the grassy path.  Rusty really enjoyed that and ran in circles for a bit.  I was very excited he started enjoying himself too.  
We did the hike in around 2 hrs.  At the end fortunately there was a stream so I could bath Rusty and myself before getting in the car.  I also changed all my muddy clothes.  Then we went to pick Liminal up and headed to our hotel.  The hotel is beautiful with great decks and mountain views though since it was raining did not get to enjoy sitting outside.  I got my new shoes and backpack, my old one no longer fits around my waist and was bruising my hips.  I also got my resupply box.  Then we went to do laundry and buy groceries.  Had a nice day laying around watching TV and eating fruits and vegetables and junk.  Also got a couple more Vermont Long Trail beers which are great!","Mad Tom Notch USFS 21

Really a cute comfortable place overlooking the Vermont mountains.  
We left at checkout time to drive to the Autumn Inn in Bennington.  We took the scenic route to enjoy the fall colors in the mountains.  We stopped in Wilmington to wander around the town but did not stay long because it started down pouring.  I did get some chocolate covered maple cookies!
We got to the Autumn Inn and packed for our 2 day backpack.  Liminal will have completed the whole AT in 23 miles!  In the morning we will meet the shuttle at the trailhead parking at VT 9 Bennington.    Then the shuttle will take us back to Kelly Stand Rd.  It will be fun hiking together again.  I also only have to carry 1 night and 2 days of food so will enjoy the light pack.  Tonight I’m enjoying 2 different Vermont beers Magic Hat TFG, taking for granite, and another Long Trail Green Blazed IPA.","Bromley View Inn

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604144,"Set my alarm for 530 so I could take a shower before meeting our shuttle at 6:45 at VT 9 Bennington.  When we were leaving the hotel, Liminal noticed a white camper van was in the hotel parking lot.  We had seen this van camping at 2 places we had comped.  When we got to the trail head VT 9 the van pulled in.  It was Hawkeye who was slack packing with his wife who was following with the van.  They seem like a very fun couple.  He is 65 and has already completed the PCT and the CDT.  He did 700 miles of the AT backpacking but then realized he’d rather slackpack.  The AT trail itself is not groomed like the other 2 trails so is slower to do.  He finishes the AT somewhere in VA so hopefully I’ll see them again.
The shuttle took us back to Kelly Stand Rd where we started Liminal’s last part of the trail.  We knew it would be a muddy mess but at least it was forecasted to stop raining by 8 and get sunny.  That did not happen.  We stopped after 3 miles at the first shelter to feed Rusty and snack.  I looked at the weather.com again to see 0% chance of rain as I watch the rain continue.   I really wished I was slackpacking today so I would end in her nice warm dry car.   Fortunately we were hiking together or I this would have definitely been a bad day.  With her company it was just a bitchy funny day.  
We started up again and my feet were numb.   It took a good mile before they felt right.  It did continue to rain but at least it warmed up.   We stopped at the next shelter for lunch and actually had a pretty view of the mountains and lake for a couple minutes before the fog blocked it.  
We started walking again and I actually finally felt good.  We passed the Glastenbury Mt tower as a couple was coming down.  We asked if there was any views and they laughed and said none so we continued to the next shelter.  We got there around 4 and decided that was far enough for the day since it was the last water source for 6 miles, we would have to get water there for dinner then carry it to wherever we were going and water weighs about 2lbs per liter.
We met Dan when we got there and he looked miserable.  He started the Long Trail 3 days ago and it has rained the entire time.  This was his first backpacking trip too.  We both told him that it was just a miserable time to be hiking with the mud, rain and cold.  He would enjoy it soon and hopefully weather.com is correct and it would be sunny and warmer for the week starting Fri.  
I got water, bathed Rusty and set up my tent.  Then went back to the shelter to make dinner.
Next Torch came in with her happy personality and brightened the place.  She was bitching about the rain and mud too but was funny about it.  Poor Dan couldn’t handle the 3 of us though and retreated to his tent.  We had a nice night making dinner and talking.  
We retreated to our tents around 730 because it got cold.  I was exhausted from the cold wet day and fell asleep right away.  I woke up at 10 to write this.  Once again I do love my cozy tent with Rusty.","Autumn Inn Motel

I started packing up around 630 in a light drizzle.  Then headed to the shelter to sit in a dry place and eat breakfast.  I don’t usually camp by shelters but really appreciated it with the rain.   I’ll remember that moving on though then I do have to watch Rusty since he loves barking. Fortunately everyone here now doesn’t mind.
We had a nice slow start making coffee and eating breakfast and talking about Liminal’s accomplishment.  She’s funny about it, I’m proud of myself for just trying and she’s finishing and doesn’t feel that pride.  The rest of us feel it for her though.  Her brother and best friend are driving from NC to meet her at the end too.  
The rain ends around 8 and we finally start walking around 930.  It warms up and actually becomes a decent day though still foggy with limited views.  The mud isn’t as bad as yesterday.  We cross paths with a lot of long trail hikers today which were fun to talk with.   They were so excited for Liminal too.
About 2 we stop for a snack and to check on where her brother and friend were. They should be arriving at the end just  before we do.   
We get to her last bridge at 3 and they aren’t there but as we walk to the parking lot they pull in and her brother hops out and videos her coming in and dropping her poles - Liminal out!   Very fun to watch their pride and celebration! We go back to the bridge and take more pics.   Liminal also runs across the street to where she actually ends her hike.  
We go back to the car and celebrate with a Yuengling - Liminal with M&Ms since she does not drink.  While they decide what to do I get all my stuff out of the car and try to stuff it all in my bag - back to a full heavy day.   I definitely will miss slackpacking and Liminal.
This morning I had planned on getting a.hotel for the night since it was suppose to be cold and the rain was suppose to start at 2.  Since it was still warm and just drizzling I decided to keep going.  I found a nice camp spot by a stream and set up.  I did put everything in the tent since I knew the rain would start soon. It doesn’t start raining hard until around 7 while I was eating so I finished dinner in tent.  Once. again I was exhausted. so fell asleep immediately.","Goddard shelter

About 3 we get to the MA line!  At 4 we stop at the first official MA campsite, in MA you are only suppose to camp in designated spots though I will see tomorrow if that’s true.  It is nice stopping early though especially since tomorrow I will start wearing my new shoes.  I bathe Rusty then set up.  I’m disappointed there is no service especially since I lost my glasses so cannot read.  Tomorrow I go through a town so will buy another one again.  I keep them in my pocket so easy to grab but also easy to slip out.

The walk starts with a pine path by a beautiful rushing brook.  Then the path goes right through someone’s driveway and he has a hose set up for hikers which really is convenient - no filtering.  I walked by an apartment dumpster so got to throw away my old shoes and socks and other trash.  We walk over the Hoosic River and the walls are painted with handprints and smily faces.  We walk through a cute little neighborhood where we can see our next big mountains.
It is a long climb though nice with lots of switchbacks and pretty views.  The leaves are noticeably greener then Vermont which is a bit surprising and interesting how the leaves change so differently.  Also something I need to look up, you would think leaves would change on top of the mountains first since it’s colder there but they don’t in Vermont.   Our first great view of the MA valley is on Mt Williams.  We have our coffee break there but then the fog moves in.  I meet a local there Steve who hikes often and he tells me that the inspiration from  Moby Dick was Mt Greylock.  We end up hiking to the summit together and had a real enjoyable conversation.  I love talking to hikers.  We both expect the weather to clear up but it doesn’t.  I sat in the lodge and got a burger and my first MA beer Big Elm 413 farmhouse ale and loved it.  
I waited for a while hoping for a view but then gave up.   I started walking down in the mist but then stopped at the next shelter to set up before the rain. Fortunately I stopped when I did because I got a wood platform which keeps your tent drier in the rain.  10 mins later the rest were taken as with the rest of the ground tent sites and shelter space.  There are tons of weekend hikers due to the sunny all weekend forecast.  One woman did not even bring her raincoat.  She did however bring an extra pair of readers which she gives me - so nice!
I ate dinner in the shelter and enjoyed the hiking stories.  Rusty though is ready for bed so we head to the tent then the downpour starts. I can hear the other hikers in the shelter talking and laughing though can’t understand what they are saying.  It’s nice though.  Also nice having service.","

Got up when the rain slowed down.  Packed up and went to the shelter to talk for awhile.  I really enjoyed talking with 2 older woman who had done a ton of hiking.  One tried an AT thru hike 2 years ago but got hurt and is now hiking different fun trails.  It’s funny that the whole rest of the group there, 15+, were all headed North.  
I left to do my 5 miles to town.  The rain did stop and it got warm and humid and foggy.  I could tell this would have been beautiful without the fog.  We walked by a fast moving stream, through wild flower fields, corn fields and town.  When we got to town I had planned to take the bus to my hotel since it stops right at the AT kiosk, however the bus doesn’t run on Sun or holidays - Ug.  I tried Uber but there were none so I got a taxi.  I did enjoy Cheshire though watching a running race on their bike path.  There were a ton of bikers and dog walkers too which were fun to see.
When I get to the Econolodge I was told dogs were only allowed in smoking rooms and I could not check in until 2.  I was fine with that because I planned to do laundry there anyway but then I was told dogs aren’t allowed in that part.  So I went to restock on food.  After I was done I came back, checked in and took a shower.  Then I went down to do Landry and was told the machines were not working.  I ask if I could use theirs and was told they’ll get back to me.  Now it’s after 5 and I’m irritated since I still don’t know.  I decide to hand wash and hope they dry.Then I walk over to Petco to buy Rusty another bully stick.  He really enjoys playing with one while I set up the tent.  He knows it’s his special treat though doesn’t really chew it.  He flips it around and pounces on it.  It’s fun to watch him but somehow he lost it 2 nights ago.  Unfortunately Petco closed at 6 so I try Homegoods which has them and has dried figs which I have to buy too.  Once again I’ll have a heavy pack from too much food but also nice for hiker hunger.Then I go back to the hotel to eat some microwave burritos which really are tasty and some great MA beers: Hobo Life, a session IPA, Wobbly POP, a New England IPA , and Tangerine Cream Summer Wheat.  Also enjoying watching our old Clemson qb doing great with the Texans.","Mark Noepel Shelter

I start my hike which went another mile through a cute Cheshire neighborhood.  I realized I left my glasses at the hotel, dummy, but I would be walking through another town with stores in 9 miles so it’s not that bad.  It was drizzling but warm so an OK hiking day.  It is muddy but not ankle deep like Vermont.  The leaves are really pretty in spots too and we do get a couple nice views of the Hoosic River.   
We get to Dalton which is really a pretty town and really decorated for Halloween.    Rusty really enjoys sniffing everything in town which makes walking slow but still fun seeing the new towns.  Once again I forgot that it’s Columbus Day so their hardware store is closed.  I walk back to their 2 gas station convenience stores and they don’t have readers.  Then I go to Kelly’s Liquor store as a last resort and they call the towns general store which is open but doesn’t carry readers either.  They suggest Walmart which is 2 miles down the road.  Right next door to the liquor store is the Shamrock Village Inn with an Appalachian Trail Hikers Welcome sign.  I walk over to check if they have vacancies and they do and they love dogs and have a special hikers rate!  I throw my bag in my room and Uber to Walmart where I buy 2 readers.  Then we head back to Kelly’s and ask the guy that works there to pick 4 good MA beers: Clown Shoes Chocolate Somdrero, Fort Hill Brewery Fresh IPA, Aeronaut Hop Hop & Away and Springdale pearyly wit.  Then we go back to the room and I shower, order Chinese food, enjoy playing on my phone and watching TV.   Best of all MNF Redskins/Saints tonight!  HTTR!!!

It was an OK hiking day.  Started off drizzly, foggy, humid and warm.  It was pretty though but muddy and slippery.  We past by a rocky mossy part in the fog and it reminded me of the witch stories I read that took place in MA along time ago.  I can’t remember exactly where they took place but this looks like a perfect spot for it.
Once again all the views were fogged in.  The sun did peek out for awhile which was nice.  Around 530 I stopped to camp and found a perfect spot up a hill from a brook.   Someone has set up a camp there with logs and a rock ring fire.  The camp overlooks the powerlines and has a pretty view though by the time I set up and made dinner it’s too dark to take a pic.  I did get a sunset pic of my tent and Rusty though it doesn’t show how pretty it really is.  We had a nice night enjoying the weather and camp spot hoping it stays clear for tomorrow.","MA 8&9 Dalton

We walked by streams, over footbridges, and actually had some mountain side views which were beautiful.  We walked through a cow field.  The cows started to come towards us and Rusty started to get excited.  I was very happy the cows stopped approaching. 
About noon though it became warm, humid and buggy.  Also the terrain shifted to saturated ground.  There was a field that we walked through with boards put in to be able to walk through the tall grasses.  Part of the boards were ankle deep underwater since it had been raining so much here.  It was actually pretty to walk through but I hate soggy shoes.
About 4 I decide to stop at the Mt Wilcox South Shelter.  The next shelter is 5 miles away and I want to actually sleep in a shelter since it is suppose to downpour at night.  Brain, a flipflopper, was there when I got there and said he didn’t mind Rusty staying in the shelter.  Dogs are not suppose to sleep in them which is why I don’t usually.  
This shelter is 3 sided and consist of 2 wooden bunks and a loft.  There is also a picnic table under the roof.  Rusty and I took the other bottom bunk which is the size of a full size bed.  It is perfect for us.  I was a bit worried about Rusty chasing something in the middle of the night so I did keep his leash on and tied to me.  
We made dinner at the picnic table and Brain gave us 2 packs of chicken since he is leaving in the morning.  He is just getting over a stomach issues from drinking untreated water and has a broken foot.  Also he works for a volunteer group that is being sent to FL to help with the hurricane clean up.   Jungle Cat, currently out hiking for 10 days and a 2016 thruhiker, joins us and starts a fire which is so nice.  He is an ultralight backpacker and cooks his meals on an open fire.  He’s from Maine but currently works and lives in NYC.  He tells great hiking stories.  It’s funny because I was stressing about staying in a shelter but end up having a great night.  
Brain did eat and start feeling better and actually now is going to town tomorrow for a zero day and then will decide what he should do.  It’s hard leaving a hike when feeling good.  We go to sleep around 9 and I do have a hard time falling asleep.  For some reason my tent makes me feel completely safe but being in a shelter without that thick tent wall doesn’t.","Mile 639.7 Up the hill from a brook near the powerlines

When we star back up the mosquitos come out in force and I stop to dig out my deet  which I apply generously.  A mosquito actually bit me through my shirt 
It starts down pouring at noon during which time we do a long pasture walk and then a long walk beside the Housatonic River.  When it pours in the green tunnel it doesn’t seem as bad.  We have 11 miles to go to get to the next shelter and there is no way I would set up in a downpour so we start walking fast.  
We walk at least a mile on rock ledges that would have great views if the weather was clear but now just make for slow going cause they’re slippery.  I definitely plan to come back and hike the MA AT because I’m missing so much.  We walk through cold shin deep water because the paths are so flooded.  Fortunately the air is warm though I am chilled by the time we reach the shelter.  I’m shocked 3 people are here since I saw 0 people hiking today.  Bees Knees is here though and I’m really happy to see her.  She zeroed with family for the weekend which is how I caught her.  Golden girl, who I met on Moosilauke, is here too and a guy that is section hiking.  
I get water then dry off Rusty and feed him.  Then I dry off and put warm clothes on.  Now I feel great and can enjoy talking to everyone and snacking.  Next I make dinner then set up in the loft since the bottom bunks are taken.  I carry Rusty up and keep him leashed so in the middle of the night he doesn’t fall off the ledge.  I don’t really think he would but it made me nervous without the leash.  
The poor section hiker has the untreated water sickness and gets up all night to puke.  I feel horrible for him and really will be careful about treating my water though I am already.  It’s still pouring out too which makes it even worse for him.  I really have a terrible night of sleep but know how lucky I am not to have the bug.","Mt Wilcox South shelter

It’s hard putting on my wet socks and shoes since it’s a cold morning but I finally get moving.  My feet are numb the first half mile but then warm up.  It was a great cold and sunny hiking day except for the places that were still saturated.  We had beautiful views all day hiking on top of mountains and on the sides.  MA is beautiful though the leaves are not as colorful yet.  We also had some more challenging rock climbs which were fun.  I had to help Rusty twice which is the first time in a while.  
Our welcome to CT was a cold fording across a rushing stream.  I carried Rusty across since the water was shin deep and moving fast.  CT had some beautiful views too.  I stopped at the Riga shelter for a snack and the view CT countryside was beautiful.  I was tempted to stay there since we both were tired but did continue to the next shelter because of the predicted rain tomorrow.  Its definitely better to do a longer today in the sun and a shorter one tomorrow in the predicted rain.  Since I have a mail drop at a hotel on the 711 mile mark and am staying there Sun,  I’ll have a 10 mile day tomorrow then a 5 mile one Sun.  (From MA - NJ you are required to stay in designated campsites so I do plan on staying in them.).

Right before the shelter we walk into a field with a stunning view, Rands view, and see a couple that have set up a nice camera to photograph sunset.  I start to take a pic of Rusty and he offers to take one of us and I happily agree.  BeesKnees and Golden Girl come out then so join us for a pic then head to the shelter.  I talk to the couple for awhile.  I would like to wait there to see the sunset but do not want to get to the shelter at dark so start walking too.  Unfortunately for me the shelter is too crowded for Rusty so I set my tent up.  I’m a bit irritated since the shelter is a half mile off the AT and I’m tenting anyway.  So basically I walked an extra mile and still might have to pack up in the cold rain.  I do enjoy eating dinner with everyone though and really do prefer sleeping in my tent.","The Hemlocks Shelter

Walking that 1/2 mile uphill to get back to the trail is really pretty.  I did not see it last night but it’s right beside a waterfall.  
The walk is very enjoyable today.  Surprising but the puddles and mud are easy to avoid today and my feet actually stay dry.  I do need to buy new insoles though because even when dry, they’re bunching up in the front of my shoes causing the tips of my toes to blister.  These are the same type of shoes I wore through Vermont so I’m surprised by the insoles. The only difference is that these were soaked for awhile so maybe that ruined them.  
Once again I love the variety of paths in CT.  We walk over the Housatonic river and see a huge loud waterfall.  We also come to a hang glider view though there are none out.  We do see and hear a little car race track.  I also saw a tiny Red Spotted Newt! I saw all the instagrams posted of these on #trektheat but was afraid it was too cold for them now.

There were two places the streams were running hard.  One I could rock scramble over but Rusty was afraid to try.  The other I took my shoes off and put my lovely orange crocs on and walked across in knee deep water.  Both I carried Rusty.  There is a pic of him waiting at the first one because I did not realize that one would scare him.  He does rock hop or swim across most but the rocks were far apart and the water was loud and rushing.
We got to the road around 9 then had a mile of road walking to my hotel.  On the way I stopped and bought a sausage, egg and cheese bagel and some meatballs for Rusty.  Hiker hunger is real!  We were able to check into our hotel, the Hitching Post Motel, early.  The owner was extremely nice and let me hang my dripping tent over his bushes, of course it rained early this morning though did stop before I got up.  
I showered then went to the liquor store for some CT beers, thru hikers get one free beer so I end up with 5, and then the convenience store for lunch and dinner: muffins, salad, chili, salsa, chips and cheese.  By 1 we are eating lunch in bed watching the skins game - perfect almost zero day.  I took a pic of the 4 beers I tried which were all tasty.  I left the free one in the fridge for someone to enjoy.One bad thing though I found about 10 ticks on Rusty though none on me.  Rusty is on tick medicine though so when they bite him they do die but still terrible to see.  Lymes is the scariest part of the trail for me.","Caesar brook campsite

I enjoyed a nice lazy day.  At 10 I left my room to get a couple more beers and food for the day.  It’s a tiny but friendly town.  I helped the hotel owner move some plants inside since there is a frost warning for tonight.  They’re from India and live at the hotel.  They grow lots of herbs and vegetables.  The inside of their  house is really nice - wide open with a couch like bench swing.  Love seeing different fun styles.
I plan on stopping tomorrow in the next town, 1 mile from the trail, to buy insoles.  Fortunately there is a bookstore there too so I can get a new book.  I realized today there is not much on TV during the weekday.  I did enjoy say yes to the dress though.  Also I need a book for at night in my tent.  
At 4:30 I decide I better get more food since the only food store here closes at 5.  It worked out great since they do an end of the day hot meal which was stuffed shells and corn bread and was very good.  Now back to getting ready for tomorrow then lounging.","Hitching Post Country Motel

The AT crosses over a road about a mile from Kent CT where I was stopping to buy insoles and a book.  When I got to the road a couple guys were getting ready to leave and I asked for a ride.  Fortunately they said yes and drove me right to the store Sundog Shoes.  I talked to the owner who recommended a replacement insole that fit perfectly and was less then $20.   I appreciate that he didn’t push the more expensive insoles and that he gives thru hikers a 10% discount.  
Next I went to the book store where I bought the book someone recommended the Alchemist.  Then I stopped at the deli and got a burger and fries.  While I was sitting and eating a guy ask if I want a ride back to the trail when I’m done.  I gladly accepted!  Anthony gets food and joins me on the patio.  He’s from the area and told me a lot about the upcoming trail.  I did not realize I was 3 miles from NY.  The AT does switch back from CT to NY a couple times.  Once again I love meeting interesting fun people and it seems hiking really encourages that.  We stop by the pharmacy so he can pick up a prescription and I can get more vitamin I and candy.  On the way back to the trail we drive by the Kent Welcoming center where there are places for hikers to take showers and charge their electronics.  I see the famous hiker Wild Bill who hikes with 2 black Shepards and carries a 70lb pack which includes the dogs’ food.  He has hiked the AT 17 times.  
Then Anthony drops me off at the trail and we hike the 3 miles to our campsite. We get there around 530 but it does get dark be the time I setup and get water.  Rusty eats his dinner and decides that my food isn’t worth staying up for so goes to bed.  I’m not hungry but do enjoy a hot tea, trail mix and candy before going in the tent at 8.  I need my warm quilt!","

Entered NY to find trail magic, peppermint patties, at the welcome sign.   Then crossed through pastures with one full of cows and calves.  Rusty started barking and one of the huge momma cows started towards us as if to protect her calf.  She intimidated me though not Rusty so I picked him up so he would stop barking.  She stopped moving towards us once he stopped barking which was a relief.
I knew we were coming to Native Landscaping which had a food truck so I was excited for an early real dinner but when I got there at 330 they had already shut down - bummer!  Also my phone was almost dead.  I had planned on eating and charging my phone at the landscaping place - so disappointed too that I could not take pics until tomorrow after charging my phone.  Right after the landscape place we walked over a beautiful boardwalk that went through taller than me ornamental grass.  At one place there were 2 Adirondack chairs and at another 2 benches to enjoy the view.  Really an awesome boardwalk. 
I got to the shelter around 5 and there was a fire going which really made me happy.  I love campfires!   There were 2 guys already here: one I had met Shocktop and the other, Felix the cat, is a section hiker and he is the one that started the fire.  Felix and I started talking about how pretty and different the trail had been.  He had taken pics so sent them to me and I did include them in the pics section.
I set my tent up and Rusty went to bed while I went back to the shelter to make dinner and enjoy the fire and company.  It was a beautiful view there too.  Then Rusty came back out but really needed to sleep so I went back to my tent.  Cleaned up and changed to jammy clothes and then wrote my blog and started reading my book.  I can hear trains and traffic in my tent which is different.","Schaghticoke mt campsite

We stopped at the Mountaintop Market Deli, .4 miles east of the trail, to get the meatball sub I was told was the best (yes it was!), a Brooklyn Lager and meatballs for Rusty.  I met Firegoat and Prospector there.  Prospector treated us lunch too - awesome trail magic!  The deli was great to hikers.  They had a picnic table out back, a place to charge your electronics and a water spigot to fill your bottles.  
We sat out back enjoying the sun and telling hiking stories.  Firegoat started nobo in May doing 20-30 miles a day but then met up with Prospector and his friend and got pulled in their fun vortex.  Prospector and his friend ran out of money so ended their nobo hike in NJ.
Firegoat loved the slow fun hike but because Katahdin closes 10/22, Firegoat has to flip up there and then will head back here south.  Prospector drove here to give Firegoat a ride and to hike Katahdin with her.  Prospector has a great gross trail name story. At the beginning of his hike  when he was digging a hole to bury his poop he dug up someone else’s.  Gross!  So he was given that lovely name reminder.
After a nice leisurely entertaining meal they drove me back to the start of the trail.  It was a nice hike to my campsite.  We went through a spot that looked like a bad storm had hit it probably a couple months ago.  Flowers had  grown out of the toppled tree roots and really looked pretty.  The AT crews here really did a great job of moving or cutting  the fallen trees out of the path.  
This campsite is great too.  There is a pump here but the water is considered contaminated so someone brought a case of water bottles to use.  Also at many of the trail heads there are jugs of water so you don’t have to use water from streams.  The streams run through cow pastures so aren’t considered safe either.  I think with a filter it should be fine but I do need to ask first.
Also this campsite has picnic tables, a fire pit and plastic chairs.   I am too lazy to start a fire though.   We do have a nice Ramon bomb dinner then a hot tea and honey.  I do start getting cold so finish my tea in the tent with my warm quilt wrapped around me.","Telephone pioneers shelter

We walked over a 911 tribute which was a flag painted on the rocks overlooking NY countryside.  It really was beautiful with the sun shining on it.  
We also walked on a ridge with a beautiful lake to one side and the woods on the other.  Rusty met a turtle there too.  First he walked over it but when I stop to take a pic he noticed it. He gently sniffed it but then started barking.  I quickly got him to move on.   
We stopped at Appalachian market which is right on the trail for a Reuben, chips and a Sam Adams, no NY microbrews here,  and meatballs for Rusty.  I also got a raisin bagel, cream cheese and Nutella for breakfast tomorrow.  On the AT NY is appreciated for the closeness of delis.  Hiker hunger is incredible.
It was 5 when we left the deli and we both were tired so we climbed the first hill and took the first stealth spot.  It’s a really pretty spot though the trees block most of the view.  We can see the pretty pink sky though.
I did make Rusty some of his freeze dried food but he didn’t eat.  I made tea for myself and picked more ticks off Rusty.  Ug!  He is on the tick medicine though so they should die soon after they bite him.  I hate seeing them though.  Also once again I hear the trains and traffic from here.","Shenandoah tenting

We started with a hike through woods in the mist but then the sun came out.  We walked on the Bear Mt bridge over Hudson River which was beautiful.  Then the AT goes right through a small zoo though Rusty was not allowed so we took the bypass path.  Both lead to the Bear Mt recreation area on Hessian Lake.  We got a coffee, a blonde brownie and cheese for Rusty and enjoyed watching people walking, running and setting up picnics.  It was such a nice diverse group and everyone was happy and friendly - perfect place to spend a beautiful Sat! We climbed the beautiful maintained path to the top of Bear Mt where we had great views of the NY countryside.  We ate lunch there with brother and sister flipfloppers Buddha and Budapest.  They are finishing their hike in PA.  Buddha retired in Jan and decided he needed to do something completely new and different so now is hiking the AT.  He plans to do something new and different every year which really is a great idea for me too.  Budapest didn’t want to be left out so quit her job and sold her house so she could join him.  Very impressive!
Then we climbed West Mt where we had great views of NYC skyline.  We got to our shelter nice and early and set up our tent.  We both are tired and needed a shorter day.  It was great because someone had already started a fire so we joined them.   He was an interesting guy too.  I mentioned that I go to my tent early because Rusty needs more sleep so usually read at night but finished my book yesterday.  He gave me a book he was reading.  I asked if he wanted mine but he already had it.  So happy!  Also met another fun section hiker.  He lives in a house of estrogen with a wife and 2 daughters.  He needs some weekends to get away from that so is enjoying slowly sectioning the AT.  He did tell funny stories that showed how much he loves his family!  He also saw me cleaning my pot with my spoon and gave me a great cleaning tool that fits right in my pot.

I got an Uber back to the trail and started hiking around 9.  It was cold and cloudy but nice to hike.  Once again it was an rocky ankle twisting day but really nice views: over ridges, side of hills, waterfalls, lakes and streams.  Also there were lots of deer, squirrels, chipmunks, woodpeckers and an owl.  Rusty is really worn out from keeping them treed though he really enjoys it.  
I got to the shelter area and set my tent up while Rusty played with his stick.  I fed Rusty and got my dinner together to take up to the shelter to eat with Buddha and Budapest.  I started heading up to the shelter and Rusty watched then crawled in the tent.  Tired pup - usually he eats some of my dinner.
Buddha and Budapest have a nice quick system going.  One gets water while the other cooks.  I got to the shelter area at least 30 mins before them.  But by the time I went up to the shelter to make dinner, Buddha had already made dinner.  Budapest came up, ate dinner and was headed back to her tent to sleep before I had finished eating.  Buddha was sleeping in the shelter and was in his sleeping bag before I was done.  They are both quick and efficient campers and really early sleepers - it was only 630.  I cleaned my pot and then went back to my tent for a nice hot tea.  Now it’s 8:00 and I’m cozy under my quilt.  Also I feel great which is a relief too.","Arden Valley rd

Also we went through farms and a donkey heehawed loudly at us.  It actually startled Rusty and he did not bark back he just growled softly.   Once again there were a ton of deer and squirrels that Rusty chased.

We continued on a ridge walk overlooking Crater Lake for a couple miles.  Two labs, a yellow and a black, started hiking with us.  I called the number on the tag and left a message to meet us at the next road crossing.  They were so cute and would run ahead then wait for us before bounding on.  When I got to the road I called again but still no answer.  I sat to filter water and think about what I should do.  Fortunately their owner pulled up and the dogs hopped right in.  I would have hated to do it because I knew they were well taken care of, but I would have probably called animal control.  Then I know their owner would get them back though would have to pay the fine.

We walked halfway around Sunfish pond right on the edge which was a beautiful hike.  In one spot there were about 10 different cairns right on the water.  There were also nice campsites right there.
We walked over the Delaware River Bridge and into PA.  Right on the bridge is the mark between NJ and PA.  Rusty was a bit annoying barking piercingly at the many trucks on the bridge.     Not sure if his bark is worse or it’s that I’m not use to it anymore.  Sorry people that he offends!  After the bridge is Delaware Water Gap.  We went to the Sycamore Grill which is .3 miles from the trail to have a cheeseburger, sweet potato fries, a beer and apple crumb pie and ice cream.  Then we saw a sign for a bakery and got a maple nut muffin and pecan pie to go.  
Next we climbed up Mt Minsi and had great views of the Delaware River.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how nice the path was since I’ve been warned how rocky it is.  Then I found out the rocks start after the next road crossing.  I’m really not looking forward to that rocky 100 miles because I really dislike having to stare at my feet so I don’t trip.  I’m terrible at it.

The rocks started today and are quite annoying.  You have to really watch where you’re walking which is no fun!  We did see a lot of deer today though and 2 snakes and I think 2 turkeys.  Rusty is not a hunter and does not notice critters unless they make noise.  I included a pic of Rusty and snake and Rusty and deer.  I tried to take a pic of the turkeys but they were too fast.  They were drinking from the spring when we came up.
Besides the critters there wasn’t much to see.  The one noted view Hahns lookout was of an industrial area in PA.  The trail did lead around to the other side looking north though which did have a pretty view of the PA countryside through trees.   You could here traffic from both sides.
One more negative thing about northern PA is lack of water. You really have to pay attention to where the water sources are.  We had to go off the trail .4 miles to get to a spring.  That is where we saw the turkey though and the water is ice cold and taste great.  It’s hard being down to one water bottle here so I can only get 2 liters at a time - 1 bottle and 1 unfilter liter.

The Knob was a great view both to the east and west.  There were rock boulders on both sides where you could sit and enjoy the view.  There was a lot of big rock climbing which I really like except today was a bit too slippery to really enjoy it though it was pretty.  
We met great trail angels at the Bare Oven Knob parking lot Backbone, 2016 thruhiker, and Cassidy.  They climbed up the Knob to see sunrise though it was too foggy to see.  They gave me a danish and an awesome beer Pumpkin Ale from Iron Hill Brewery in Newark DE where they both worked.  They also took my trash - they made my day even better!
We made it to the shelter around 4 and no one was there.  We sat on the picnic table and I fed Rusty, snacked and read my book for around an hour before making dinner.  Right after dinner the rain started so we went in the shelter.  The flipflopper from yesterday came then.  He’s actually slower than me.  Since he slept in his tent, he did not even start packing up until the rain stopped.  He does not like sleeping in shelters.  To avoid getting the inside of his tent wet, he set his tent up in the shelter then moved it outside to a tent site - very smart.  He is from France and has been hiking now for 8 months.  He finishes in Harper’s Ferry and then will go back to France.  
The rain is suppose to continue till 9am tomorrow so I plan on another slow morning.  I’m getting lazier by the day but so much more enjoyable when not wet.","Bake Oven Knob shelter

As expected it rained till 9 so had a nice slow start.  Unfortunately my fuel ran out when making coffee. I did get a warm coffee but will have to eat a cold dinner which is a bummer and no hot oatmeal or hot tea.  I do have a replacement coming in my mail drop tomorrow.
Todays hike started off poorly with the wet cold and ankle twisting and slippery rocks but then the sun came out.  Once again there were lots of great views mixed in with the rocks.  We came to Dans Pulpit first which had a beautiful view of the countryside and no one was around.  We walked a couple of more miles until the Pinnacle spur trail joined the AT then the trail became mobbed with hikers.   We did a couple mile slow steady climb on a wet muddy gravel/grass road to get to the Pinnacle which was mobbed.  Then we walked about another mile on a narrow winding path to get to Pulpit Rock  which was also crowded but not as bad.  I enjoyed the crowd there and loved the view.
We were planning on stopping at the next shelter but it was crowded.  Also the next couple stealth camping spots listed in Guthooks were taken.  We did not find a spot until 6 when the sun was setting.  I had already gotten water though so just had to set the tent up.  Fed Rusty then he went to bed and I ate bars and trail mix for dinner.  Not a good way to end the day; however, I’ll have a very short walk to town tomorrow and then a much needed shower!","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

I’m looking forward to following their journey!
Fortunately I was allowed to check in right away and enjoy their complementary continental breakfast.  Then I took a wonderful hot, long shower!  Then we headed to Walmart to get a prescription.  What a mess!  I called Tues to have it filled.  I had to switch pharmacies since there is no CVS here.  Weds they left a message questioning if I really wanted the Hamburg location.  I called back and said yes and reminded them that’s why it’s a vacation override and I should be able to pick up 4 packs.  Thurs they left a message asking for the CVS number.  (I keep my phone in airplane mode during the day to save my battery.)  I talked to them 4 times before going to pick it up.  When I get there the cashier at the pharmacy had no record of me.  I showed her my phone showing all the voice messages from their phone number.  Finally the pharmacist came up and talked to me.  He found my information and then said he did not have that pill in stock but will order it to be there later in the week.  I asked why they hadn’t told me that originally or order it earlier and he shrugged and said sorry.  So frustrating!  Then I went to the liquor store where I was informed they do not sell beer.  What!  Beer is sold at a distributor in PA and is closed on sundays.   The guys there were very nice though and did say that PA is changing that rule.  I bought a bottle of wine.  
Then I headed back to my hotel.  I called Weis pharmacy and they do not carry that pill either but will order it and it will be in tomorrow after 3.  So I booked my hotel for another night.  I’m taking the pill daily so I do not have to deal with having a period while hiking (sorry if that’s tmi).  
Now I can enjoy the skins game.  I did really want beer though so at half time I went to the bar in the hotel to see if I could get beer to go.  Yes!  I had 2 great PA beers both from Rusty Rail Brewing: Swing Tree white IPA and Fog Monster NEIPA.  It was an ugly game but still nice to watch laying in bed.
There is no microwave or fridge in this room.  I planned on ordering Chinese for dinner but there is none that deliver here.  I went back downstairs and got nachos for dinner which were ok.  I read and watched football the rest of the night.","Stealth

Next I got an Uber to take me to pick up my prescription and fortunately it was there!  
We met the Buddha’s and River Strap in our hotel bar for dinner.  Unfortunately they did not allow Rusty.  I planned to just order food and eat in my room, but they decided we should eat in the lobby - very nice of them!  It was fun hearing their hiking stories.  River Strap is a sobo hiker too.  He’s from CO and retired from his first career to do this.  In Maine he met a nobo thruhiker that did not speak English well and was very frustrated.  River Strap asked him what was wrong and the hiker explained he had no money and his bank card was rejected.  The bank was sending a new one to his address in NY so he would have no money for days.  River Strap then gave him $500 to hold him over til he got his card.  The hiker called his brother and asked him to send River Strap’s wife the money which she received.  He invited River Strap to visit him in NY when he passed by.  River Strap did stop in NY where he was treated like a king: given subway passes to get to NYC and complementary tickets for different museums and other fun places.  It’s really nice to be able to trust a complete stranger like that!
Also I found out Buddha was a politician, district attorney, before retiring.  The photo on this page is of him.  
The night ended with both Buddha and River Strap reciting poet.  My favorite was The Quitter which I wrote down so will remember.  
Buddha showed me the weather forecast of the rain lasting till 2 tomorrow.  They are staying another night to avoid hiking in it.  I only plan on hiking 9 to the first shelter so said I’d be ok.  He did remind me that it gets dark now at 5.  I said I’d be ok. 
Tues morning it was pouring but I was still hoping it would stop.  However at 10, my lunch time, I walked over to Wendy’s in the rain and decided to see if my room was available for the night.  Fortunately it was so I stayed another night.  Ug and yay at the same time.
The rain stopped around 4 and I went with the Buddha’s to Port Clinton to pick up their mail drop and to stop at the Peanut Shop which is a fun old fashion candy store.  I got yummy licorice spice drops and a variety of spice drops.  
The four of us ordered barbecue and pizza and got beer from the hotel bar and ate in the lobby again.  It was a very  nice zero couple days.  We all plan on shuttling together at 7:30 tomorrow.","Microtel Hotel

The shuttle dropped me off in Port Clinton.  He took the Buddhas further north 15 miles to where they had gotten off Mon.  The hike started off pretty by the firehouse, over a bridge and then by the railroad tracks.  After crossing the railroad track we got to walk on the beautiful Schuylkill River trail.  It looked like we be on it for awhile - a nice flat beautiful river walk!  But then I saw the white blazes veer off and up the mountain - bummer!  I should have taken pics but I still had Rusty on a leash because there were railroad workers around.  
Once we veered off and headed up I did take Rusty’s leash off.  The uphill wasn’t bad and felt great to be hiking again.  We took our first break around 9 cause Rusty needed breakfast.  He kept trying to show me places off the path to stop.  A couple hours after that I was ready for a coffee break.  I usually wait for a view to stop but after about an hour of finding nothing, I just stopped in the  middle of the path.  After that the hike just became annoying: rocks, mud, water and no views.  For around 2 miles the path was so flooded I just had to splish splash through and it was ankle deep in places.  The water was cold but fortunately the air wasn’t.  I was really ready to stop for the night but wanted to walk till at least 5.  I forgot that it gets dark by 530 now.  I did finally find a great spot right around 5.  By the time I got my tent up, cleaned up with warm clothes on and my food ready it was dark.  I guess my new stopping time is 430.  Not a fun afternoon though good to be hiking again.","Port Clinton

Nice easy walk through the woods..,
Now rocky but at least there’s a view of the farmland..

Pretty evergreen forest walk..
Ug splish splashing shin deep through the waterlogged path...
It’s 430 and getting dark need to find a campsite...
The splish splash part was a 100 yd area that was flooded from a beaver pond.  Fortunately at the start someone posted a warning to switch to crocs before walking through the section.  I did and pushed up my pants.  The water was cold and the air was in the upper 40s so not terrible.  It was muddy and uncomfortable though.
The campsites we came to first were flooded so we ended up at a shelter around 530 in the dark.    The shelter was .3 miles off the trail but was dry and the spring was right in front of the shelter and no one was there!  Unfortunately there is no service and I really wanted to check on the weather.   Last time I checked the rain was suppose to start at 2pm on fri and continue through the night.  We have 18 miles to the next shelter so are going to try to leave here by 7.

This was an awesome shelter.  There is a sleeping loft and a picnic table in the shelter.  There were 2 men at the picnic table playing chess and a young section hiker that was setting his hammock up in the shelter.  Rusty and I took the downstairs corner.  The 2 men were in their 60s and had been playing chess together since their 20s and were very fun to listen to.  The section hiker is from MD and started his hike today even though it was raining because it was the plan.  That impresses me because I could not leave a warm dry car in the cold rain.
I had a great meatball dinner tonight thanks to Buddha.  The Buddha’s had overstocked so they offered me 3 of Buddha’s homemade dehydrated dinners.  I’m so glad I took them!  I had another hot tea and now I’m ready for bed at 6.  The other guys are already asleep so I don’t feel too bad.   Tomorrow I only have 10 miles to go to get to the Doyle $25/night right on the AT.","

It was hard getting moving this morning because it was cold and windy and my shoes were wet.   Once I got moving I was ok except for my hands.  My gloves were wet from yesterday so I alternated from putting my hands in my sleeves to warm up and using my poles where my hands froze.   There were snow flurries this morning and a feel like temp of 21.  Fortunately the sun was out.  After about an hour I felt great except for my hands.  It was a pretty walk switching between on top of the ridge and then east and west side of the mountain.  The east side was warm and sunny and no wind.  We took a nice warm coffee break on that side.  The west side was windy and cold though had pretty views too.  Coming down to Duncannon was on a nice pretty switch back trail.  Going over the bridge into Duncannon was extremely windy and cold but once we reached the town it was nice.  The town was cute and the Doyle was right on the path through town.  As soon as I got there I went in the bar to get one of their famous hamburgers and yum!   The bartender/chef was the 2016 thruhiker Indian.  I sat by a guy that grows the peppers for the awesome Doyle chili (yes I had a bowl of that too).   He actually drove me to the supermarket to restock so I would not have to overpay at the convenience store.  The owners were away for their 40th anniversary and people were disappointed I did not get to meet them.  They are well loved here.   
The room and shared bathroom is just how it’s described except that the shower water pressure and temp are great!  Also the laundromat is a block away and the Doyle has loaner clothes to use so you can clean all your clothes.  For $25 it’s perfect.

I packed up and left about 10.  We hiked the rest of the way through the town and then up to Hawk Rock view which was beautiful.  It was a perfect hiking day cold and sunny.  Most of the hike had great views.  I stopped in the sun for a coffee break and the section hiker from Peters Mt Shelter walks up with his girlfriend, Dad and sister.   Before they saw me the Dad says this is perfect for a hot chocolate break.  I agreed then heard hey Rusty.  Really nice seeing him again with his family.  They offered me hot chocolate too but I already was enjoying my coffee but I did take some Brie and crackers - great treat!  They also gave Rusty some Bison jerky.  It was nice sitting in the warm sun and talking to them.

It was funny seeing 4 different AT halfway point markers.  The trail gets rerouted often so the mileage changes.  Also, not that I would have tried in the cold, the Pine Groove Furnace State Park general store was not open and that’s the place of the half gallon thruhiker ice cream challenge - eating a half gallon of ice cream.  Most can do it.

I then repack and made coffee and oatmeal.  We got started a little after 7 so not too bad.

We made it to our shelter around 3 and I was so happy to be done and able to put on nice dry socks.   I was also happy no one was here.  We made a dinner that included Forager recommendations of adding butter and summer sausage to meals instead of Ramon.   It was very tasty.   
By 5:30 we were in our beds but we actually stayed up talking and then texting our Clemson gang during the Clemson/Duke game.  We only have 1 bar of service so cannot get the Internet.  It’s 1030 now though so very late for us.  Maybe tonight I’ll actually sleep normal.","US 30 Fayetteville

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605409,"I did sleep much better last night going to bed at a normal time.  We were meeting a friend for a hike/lunch today so I set my alarm for 6:30 to make sure I knew to start getting ready then.  Because of the snow and cold making it hard to sit down for an enjoyable long break, I made my coffee while still in bed.   Actually made a nice start to the morning.   Still it was hard to put cold wet shoes on but as usually our feet got use to it quickly.   The snow was still pretty but also made for an annoying, wet, cold and slippery path.  
We got to the Mason Dixon line and it reminded me of my first backpacking hike on the AT with my son Dan 2.5 years ago.  It was where we started.  We are going to stay at the same shelters as we did last time except that then we were warm and slept in tents. 
Right after that we got to Pen Mar Park where we met Eileen and Kathleen.   It was so good to see them!  It’s funny but while hiking I don’t think that much about missing people, but when I see them I really miss them more.  I decided then that I have to stop on Tues night in Harper’s Ferry so I can go to my Cape friends Thanksgiving dinner party Weds.
Unfortunately and really stupid but Pen Mar State Park does not open its parking lot until 11 so Kathleen had to move her car and couldn’t hike with us.  Instead she parked her car at the next lot which was at High Rock view and we hiked there.  Very nice for us though we put our packs in her car and walked the 3 miles to meet her without packs.  Eileen came with us and really enjoyed it though the snow made it slow going.  High Rocks was beautiful but we ate lunch in Kathleen’s car because of the cold.  Her car was extremely cozy - warm and comfy seats!   Also Eileen brought us a great lunch - fresh rolls, cheese, salami, grapes, apples, almonds and chocolate!   She also gave us nice warming nippers: Fireball, Baileys, Kailua, and Jamison.  Thank you!  We enjoyed our long lunch and company.  The spot was busy with people stopping by to get a view and we had fun watching them.  
About 2 we decided we better start hiking to our shelter.   When we hopped out of the car, Pete realized one of the cars was stuck in the snow.  He went up to them and told the driver how to get out.  He also helped push them out.  Then we started our hike.  It had some pretty views though my phone died so could not take pics.  Antietam Creek was too high so there was a 2 mile street walk around which we did.  We ended up walking in the moonlight to the shelter.  We got in around 6.  I dropped my pack then went to get water.  I could not find the path so I just headed through the snow to the running water sound.   We filled up enough for dinner. 
At the shelter I immediately switched to warm dry clothes then sat to snack.  Pete first got his pad blown up and his sleep area set up then changed.  
We enjoyed 2 freeze dried meals, a turkey casserole and a pad Thai, then had a nightcap - Fireball and Jamison.  Thanks!
Then we crawled in a warm beds.","Deer Lick Shelter

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605410,"About midnight a hiker came in to our shelter and quickly unpacked and moved to the upstairs spot to sleep.  Actually I was quite impressed how quiet and quick he was.  Rusty did not bark fortunately but I did let the hiker know I had a dog. 
Both Pete and I woke early and tried to be very quiet.  I needed more water but did not want to put my wet socks/shoes on so I put bags over my nice warm socks and then put on my crocs.  Then I went through the snow to the stream and got my water.  My feet stayed dry!  I made oatmeal and coffee and the other hiker woke up and joined us.  His name is Production and he is a flipflopper finishing at Pine Groove State Park.  He got his name because he takes long breaks where he sets up everything - makes a production.  He walked 35 miles yesterday because he wants to finish by Thanksgiving.   He started at the end of April.
Also Rusty is now eating in the morning since I’ve been being slower at getting out.   Rusty now wakes up and wanders around then comes back and eats.
It still was hard to put on our wet cold shoes but at least it was warmer.  All through the night we heard the snow melting.  It actually sounded like rain at times.  The hike started uphill so we quickly warmed up and took a layer off.  The path was still muddy, wet and snowy but had great views.  We stopped at Annapolis Rocks for a nice long break in the sun.  It was still a beautiful view but was foggy.  We needed water but did not get it at Annapolis Rocks since it’s a 1/4 mile hike down to it and there  was water everywhere.  I was wrong though and there wasn’t actually water for another 5 miles at the Washington Monument State Park.  We got our water from the pump and sat to enjoy it except that it had a metallic taste.  We did still both drink almost a liter but really prefer spring water.  We also bathed Rusty with the pump since he was muddy a mess.  
For the next 1/2 mile the path was still gross but then it became pretty dry.  It looked like it really did not snow much there. We got to the Rocky Run shelter around 3:30 and it is beautiful.  We walked down to the spring and got lots of great tasting water.  We had  spicettes and peanut butter and Nutella for a snack.  Pete also had summer sausage which he shared with Rusty.   
Pete noticed how beautiful the sky looked so climbed up to the campsites to see if he could actually see the sun setting and he could.  We joined him and I showed him the camp spot Dan and I had camped at during our trip.  We watched the sun go down into to the trees then went back down to the shelter.  We made a nice Ramon bomb for our last night out here.  We do not get much reception in the shelter, so Pete went out of the shelter about 20 yards and the reception is great.  He is getting his son Matthew to pick us up tomorrow in Harper’s Ferry.  Then we had the best nightcap Kailua and Baileys - thanks!","Ensign Cowall Shelter

MD paths are nice and wide for the most part so easy terrain except that they were waterlogged.   We had to walk up on the sides a lot.  MD also is beautiful with a lot of great overlooks and historic sites.  My favorite is Weverton Cliffs which overlooks the Potomac.  
Walking over the Potomac on the Byron Memorial FootBridge to Harper’s Ferry is great too.  It’s absolutely beautiful along with the town Harper’s Ferry which the AT goes through.  Once again it reminded me of my hike with my son - we were so happy to get to town.  
We walked up through town and there were groups of students exploring the town.  One of the groups asked if we were hiking the AT and were quite impressed that we had walked more than their tiring 1 mile.  Another group surrounded Rusty and took a ton of selfies with him since he was the prettiest dog they had ever seen.  Their chaperone was really funny admitting that Rusty was the highlight of this field trip.   
We ended at the ATC HQ exactly when my mom and dad were walking up.  It was wonderful to see them!  We went inside and had our picture taken for the 2018 album.  I looked through the album to see if I could find a couple of the hikers that I started with but did not see them.  It was great talking to the people at the HQ.  They are so positive and encouraging.
My nephew Matthew came in shortly after and it was great to see him.  He came to pick up Pete.  He is a very handsome VA Tech student that really seems a lot like Pete.

My parents drove me back to Harper’s Ferry and we stopped in the ATC HQ to use the bathroom.  Once again it was great to talk to the staff since they all love the trail.
I headed the wrong way to the AT path and fortunately my parents knew it and saw me.  They pointed out the right way which was pretty funny.
It was a warm sunny hiking day.  I switched to shorts and a tee within a mile.  The WV path is beautiful overlooking the Potomac.  I walked with 2 older men for the first couple miles and we talked about how relaxing backpacking is when you have unlimited time.  They were just enjoying a day hike today.  
Then I crossed over the Shenandoah River bridge which is beautiful.  Then headed uphill to VA.  I met a hiker there that had a beautiful Springer spaniel.  He was day hiking also and we walked together for the next couple miles talking about fun hikes in this area.  He has hiked a lot and gave me new places to hike for next year.  After he turned around, I met a great couple, Bonnie and Bob, who walk this trail often.  They were picking up trash. We were talking about how wet and flooded the trail was.  Bonnie mentioned she had waterproof socks and I told her a friend, who paddleboards all winter, told me about them last tues and I was planning on getting a pair.  Bonnie took her pair off and handed them to me since she thought I needed them more.  They also asked me if I needed anything else - so nice!
We got to the shelter around 3.  This shelter has a path leading to double swing and picnic table which are under a roof.  The campsites have picnic tables too.  It’s suppose to rain tomorrow morning though so i am staying in the shelter.

It was cold and sunny and an easy pretty hike through the woods.  We really made good timing and I called Kathy to tell her we’d be early.  Unfortunately the parking lot I gave for pickup was a gravel lot off a pretty bad gravel road.  I called to ask her if she wanted me to change the pickup place but she said she’d make it and she did even though she had a little car.  I was quite impressed.  It was great catching up and the drive to her house was beautiful.   She lives in the country and can see the mountains from her house.  
She has two 6 month old corgis who were very excited to meet Rusty.  Old man Rusty though wanted nothing to do with them.  I however really enjoyed watching them play.  I also enjoyed all the great food and drinks I was given.  Connor, Kathy’s son, made us a great dinner which I enjoyed watching him make.  It’s really great to see families cooking and eating together.   Yes, especially when I get to share!  We had a relaxing rest of the night watching sitcoms.  I also loved seeing all their Christmas decorations and listening to Christmas music.  I really will miss decorating.","Sam Moore shelter

Jon made us tasty omelets then drove me in his Jeep back to the trailhead.  It was fun riding in the Jeep on the gravel road.  We walked together with the 3 pups for about a mile.  It was windy and cold but all the dogs loved it.    There were a lot of branches that had blown on the trail.  The winds were over 20 mph last night and today were in the teens.  The feel like temp was 17.  
It was comfortably walking but freezing when you stopped.  There was a hostel right off the path and I decided to stay there.  I emailed and fortunately they had room and accepted dogs.  I got to the hostel around 4 right as the owner Scott was pulling up.  He is a 2016 thruhiker so is fun to talk to and his cabin is perfect.  He has a big collection of tea which I really enjoyed.  He also has lots of food to buy that is priced fairly.   It’s after 10 now though so time for bed.  Rusty and I are the only ones here tonight.","

The cabin has a boot dryer.  Though my shoes were dry, I put them on the dryer during breakfast (Scott suggested it).  After packing up, I enjoyed putting my warm shoes on - what a great way to start a hike on a cold day!
I started hiking around 8:30.  It was cold, cloudy and windy.  The sun did come out around noon and depending on which side of the mountain I was on varied from cold to warm.  That makes it hard because I kept taking my jacket on and off which means stopping to take my backpack on and off.  There was still snow and ice on the cold side of the mountains which was quite pretty.
About 4 miles into the hike, I entered Shenandoah National Park.  I was disappointed all the waysides were closed since they are known for good food; however, the views were great with all the leaves off the trees.  Also, though I could see skyline drive road, there weren’t many cars.  The AT parallels the road and crosses back and forth which would be annoying if the park was busy.  
Unfortunately the shelters were at inconvenient spots for me.  I was not ready to stop after 13 miles and did not want to walk 26.  I waited till after 4 and got water at the first stream I crossed.  Then I looked for a stealth spot which did take an hour so I ended up setting up at 5:00 with a beautiful pink sky.  The ground was frozen so I used a rock to hammer in my tent stakes.  It was dark and freezing by the time I was ready to start dinner.  We ate quickly and then dove in our tent and under our quilt.  It did take awhile to warm up but now we are very content.  It is in the upper 20s.","Mountain Home Cabin

We enjoyed a slow morning drinking coffee and eating good food.  The hike started off with a nice climb.  I was wearing shorts and a tee shirt and still was sweating in the warm sun which felt great.   The views were beautiful with much of the hike on the side of the mountain.  
At the first view point from Hightop Mt I met a couple from VA that were enjoying a day hike.  They had lost their dog 2 years ago and really missed having a pup though were not ready for one yet.  They enjoyed seeing Rusty.
At the Powell Gap Hollow view we saw Forager - so nice to run into him again.  He is done in less then 200 miles at McAfee Knob.  We stopped there for a nice long break in the sun.  We are really enjoying the warm day.  
We ran into Forager a couple miles later and then walked with him to our shelter.  About 3 miles before our shelter we hit the spot where the PATC has stopped clearing the trees off the trail.  It was really hard to get around the damage.  Two weeks ago there was an ice storm that damaged the southern path of the Shenandoah.  The road was still closed from Swift Run Gap to the southern end of the park.  Other hikers and the SNP crew had suggested road walking since it was hard and unsafe to take the trail.  It really didn’t sound fun to road walk but it actually was really enjoyable.  The views were great.
The warning from the SNP website:  “This area was the hardest hit by last week’s ice storm. Crews have been working steadily, but it is slow going and the additional rain and fog are hindering efforts. As of today, crews have cut approximately 700 trees between miles 65 and 80, and an additional 200 between miles 102 and 105. They have not yet been able to get to the remaining portion, so estimates of how much longer the cleanup will take are difficult. Initial estimates indicate 100 down trees per mile. Once the road is cleared of down trees, crews will still need to assess overhanging limbs and chip trees that have been dragged to the shoulder.”
We got back on the path right before the shelter which we got to around 4.  It was really nice setting up and making dinner in the warmer weather.  Forager has feet issues so rubs his feet and legs with a ball.  He also massages his feet and  stretches.  I massaged my feet and stretched too which felt great.  We actually stayed up till 7 before getting in our beds.  Then we talked for another hour.  It was really nice to have Forager there.  Forager gets up around 5:30 so he can stretch and get moving before light.  I am going to get up then too but will wait for light to start hiking.","Swift Run Gap

It was much easier getting up in the warmer morning.  I made breakfast and coffee and stretched.   We ended up hiking out together.  The path to the next road crossing was cleared by the PATC so we were hopeful we had a cleared trail for awhile but it only lasted till the next road crossing.  Once again we decided to road walk.  
We walked by a crew that was parked and eating breakfast.  We stopped shortly afterwords to eat and stretch.  Forager stops to stretch every couple hours.  He is determined to finish his thruhike even though he has problems with his foot.  Stretching and massaging have kept the pain down.  It’s actually good for me too.  It would be hard in the cold though but really nice today.  While we are sitting there the crew drives up and stops about 25 yards from us.  It was weird and annoying since I now needed to keep Rusty on a leash.  About 15 mins of them watching us, one of the crew comes over to talk to us.  He points out that we are sitting under a broken tree that they need to take down.  So funny!  We apologized and started walking.  Of all the dumb things to do!  As campers we had been warned plenty to be aware of your surroundings making sure never to camp under broken trees.
We continued on our road walk.  We got to the next shelter, 13 miles, around 12:30.  We stopped there for lunch and a stretch.  It was too early to stop so we decided to hike 13 miles to the next shelter.  Tenting would be pretty hard to do with all the damage and really not safe with the wind.  26 miles and night hiking would be a challenge but fun too.  We headed back to the road. 
We stopped often to stretch and eat.  We ran into one a Foragers friends 50 50.  They had met in VA and then seen each other numerous times on the trail.  Both had had injuries and taken breaks but had continued.  Once again great motivation for me.  Both were finishing in less then 200 miles.  50 50 warned us that the ice storm damage was terrible all the way through to Daleville.   Ug!  
We started hiking again.  We put on our headlamps around 430.   We enjoyed the beautiful sunset and all the viewpoints.  Once it got dark it started getting colder and both Rusty and I were ready to be done.  We had to go back on the trail about a mile before the shelter.  Forager was using Guthooks to determine the best spot.  When we got to it there was an AT detour sign since the trail was closed around the power lines.  Fortunately the detour was only a mile on a fire road and the path the clear.  Once we got back on the trail we only had a 1/2 mile to go to the shelter.  It was rocky but clear.  We got to the spring first and filled up then headed the last bit to the shelter.  We got to the shelter around 8.  There were trees down all around it but the shelter had no damage.  I changed into warm clothes immediately then started dinner. Forager stretched first, then set up and started dinner.  Dinner was great but I got chilled so quickly got under my quilt and felt much better.  It was about 10 which is probably my latest night out here.  Forager continued to eat.  It is really impressive how much he eats and all the different types of food he has.  Fortunately for Rusty he doesn’t mind sharing with him.  Rusty really enjoys him being with us too.","Pinefield Hut

The path south of the shelter was not cleared at all and made for extremely slow going.  I tended to try to climb over and push my way through so Forager renamed us Rampage and Firefox.  I really like that name though feel weird switching to it after 1300 miles.  I do think it fits us better though.  
I cut back to the road when we lost the trail after climbing over the downed trees.  Forager did refind the trail and took it back to the road.  That’s actually when he gave us our new trail names.  We stopped to eat and stretch them road walked to the end of Skyline Drive.  We came across 3 tree cutting crews that were working hard.  They still don’t think it’s going to be soon that the road will reopen since they have to go back and cut trees that are damaged though haven’t fallen.
We finished our hike and walked to King’s Gourmet Popcorn place.  We got chili dogs, fries and kettle corn that were all great. We talked about maybe slackpacking tomorrow depending on weather.  I like that idea too.

We left here to just a little snow but, by the time we got to Reeds Gap, it was snowing pretty hard.  Since the roads were closed and the trail was a mess we started with a 5 mile road walk.  It was absolutely beautiful with huge snowflakes.  Rusty was so excited racing through the snow.  Once again it was really fun walking the road and seeing all the icicles, plants and trees growing on the rock cliff beside the road.  The overlooks were fogged in at times and then clearer.
When the AT crossed the road at Dripping Rock, we took the trail since it looked pretty clear.  It was a winter wonderland!  Part of the time we were walking through a white tunnel.  We had some absolutely stunning views too.  Then we came to the end of the trail clearing.  It was unbelievable how much damage was done.  It made us really appreciate the work the trail crew had already done and had much work they had left.  
We did have fun navigating the downed trees but, 7 miles was enough, so we went back to the road at Humpback Rock.  We had a fun 7 mile road walk back to Rockfish Gap.  We were really excited to get to the end for Kings Gourmet Popcorn and chili dogs and popcorn but, unfortunately, they were closed.  Forager’s mom came to pick us up in her warm comfy car and took us back to our hotel.   Rusty jumped in bed and went right to sleep.  I unpacked quickly and took a long hot shower.  Then I heated up my frozen veggie lasagna meal which I ate with cheese dip, guacamole, chips and a mini bottle of red wine.  Now I’m nice and cozy watching a cute hallmark Christmas movie.
Forager’s mom is a true trail angel that made this beautiful day possible.  I would never had hiked in that snow if I wasn’t headed back to a hotel.  Also the downed trees with a full backpack would not have been as fun.  With a light pack it really was great.  What a treat - thanks!","Rockfish Gap

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605809,"Enjoyed the complimentary breakfast at Quality Inn.  We drove to Reeds Gap and started our hike around 9.   Forager was hiking 10 miles today.  He is enjoying hanging with his mom so was meeting her then headed to a hotel.  They are a great team!   I was hiking 15 miles to the next shelter since the weather was nice.  
Our hike was beautiful.  All day we had great views since the trail ran on the sides of the mountains or on the ridges.  Snow covered the higher altitudes and the cold side of the mountains but was completely gone on the sunny parts.  There were broken branches and trees on parts in the trail but nothing like the Shenandoah. 
It was great hiking and talking to Forager.  He such an interesting person and involved in so many different things.  He is a healthy cook and has given me many new recipes for cooking that I can’t wait to try.  Yes, food dominates all hikers conversations.  
We stopped for a great lunch, including Wholly Guacamole that I highly recommend, in a warm spot.  Rusty once again enjoyed sharing Forager’s bacon and cheese snack.  He actually wrapped a piece of cheese with bacon for him. 
We realized that we were walking slower then normal.  We did stop to talk to 3 older day hikers and their 14 year old pup.  Also we had to climb around the debris and the trail did go over some rocky patches.  We arrived at the pickup stop around 3:30.  I really was tempted to go to the hotel with them but knew I really should keep going.  I gave them both a hug and headed out.  I will miss hiking with Forager but am excited for him finishing in less than 100 miles.  Rusty will miss him too! 
My hike was now uphill to the top of the Priest mountain.  I stopped around 4 to feed Rusty, snack and get my headlamp.  I could not find my headlamp which was terrible since I knew I would not finish until 6 and it would be dark.  I did panic a bit but then realized my phone had a flashlight.  I was mad at myself for not checking the hotel room more thorough though I had opened every drawer and did look under the bed.  I got going quickly and hiked as fast as I could.  The sunset views were beautiful though so very hard not to stop and enjoy and take pictures.  Fortunately I was in high elevation when it was getting really dark and the snow was still there so I could follow the tracks left by other hikers.  When I saw the shelter sign I turned off and the tracks were gone so I did need to use my phone flashlight.  It was only .1 mile away but not fun to hike in the dark with just my phone light.      
I was very happy to reach the shelter.  I fed Rusty then started feeling really chilly.  I put on warm clothes and wrapped my quilt around me.  I did not even get water since I had just enough  for a cup for Rusty and to make dinner.  I’ll find the spring in the morning when it’s light.   
Once I finally relaxed, I realized that I had moved my headlamp to the water pouch place in my backpack when we were slack packing.  I was so happy to find it!   I made dinner and we snacked on cheese and peanut butter.  I was very happy to get into bed and get completely warm.","Reeds Gap

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605810,"Woke up to a beautiful sunrise and a freezing day.  I had no water left so I had to get and filter water this morning - no fun in the cold.   I made coffee and oatmeal.  Then I packed up.  Both my socks and shoes were frozen and stiff.  I decided to use a dry pair of socks then I tried to put my shoes on and realized they would not bend.  I had to push on them with my hands to make them my pliable.  I finally got them on but now my feet were chilled.  After hiking for around 10 mins my feet and body warmed up.  After about an hour I had to switch from my heavy pants to my thin pants and from my ski mittens to my fleece gloves.   
Rusty was really enjoying the cold day and the snow.  The mountain views were great all day.   We went up one mountain that had a grassy meadow on top.  We also walked by the edge of a stream.  
Originally I had planned to camp but there was still snow on the ground so I decided to go to the next shelter.  On the way there I met 5 college kids, actually the only people I saw today, who were also going to the shelter.  The next shelter was only 5 more miles and it was only 330 so I decided to go to that one.   It was also downhill so was hoping it would be warmer - 1358 instead of 3468ft.
It was a beautiful sunset highlighting the mountain tops.  We walked by a beautiful stream for the last mile.  I had to put my headlamp on for the last 30 mins.  We got to the shelter around 6 and got water first.  We set our bed up and made dinner.   Right after dinner we crawled under our warm quilt.  Both of us are wiped out from the long hike and cold weather.  I’m looking forward to a great night sleep listening to the loud stream in front of the shelter.","The Priest Shelter

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605811,"Slept great last night with the running stream.   Woke up and made breakfast.  I’m now taking Foragers advice of adding butter to everything.  So now breakfast is 2 Cliff bars, 2 packets of oatmeal with a tablespoon of butter in each and coffee.  The best about thing about oatmeal packets for hikers is that you can add the boiling water directly in the packet and butter makes it better!  I’m also adding butter to Mountain House dinners instead of ramen noodles.   Hopefully after my hike is done, my insane hunger will go too.
Once again my socks and shoes were frozen and stiff.  I put my socks in my lap during breakfast and they did thaw but my shoes did not.  I have read that you can sleep with your shoes and socks in your sleeping bag to prevent them from freezing but I love my quilt.  I hate the idea of putting my stinky shoes and socks in it but I guess I will start.  I put my feet freezers on last and started hiking.  Fortunately my feet warmed up quickly.
The hike started by the stream and then wrapped around a beautiful lake though way above it.  We also climbed some mountains, were in evergreen forest and were in rhododendron tunnels.  It was nice seeing the plants and trees that stay green in the snow.  In places there were even green ferns poking through the snow.  
I stopped around 2 for a snack and to see if I had service.  I did not but fortunately people had texted warning me there was a big snow storm predicted for tomorrow.  I was aware there might be one but I couldn’t check last night since there was no service.  Originally I had planned to hike to a shelter 1.8 miles from the town my mail drop was coming so I would just get a hotel for Sun night but with the expected storm I decided to hike the 1.8 miles and get the hotel for 2 nights.   
There is no service at the trailhead so I hiked a couple more miles then checked again.  Fortunately I got service so I found a shuttle then booked a motel.  I was 4 miles from the trailhead and told the shuttle I’d be there at 5 which was in 2hrs.  I hiked quickly and got to the trailhead at 430.  Pretty funny how fast you can go when you push!
My shuttle took me to Food Lion first so I could stock up for the snow day - food and booze.  I got to the hotel and took a hot shower while cleaning my clothes.  Then put my jammies on and ate dinner.  I was really hungry from the cold fast hiking so ate way too much.  Now enjoying the warmth and watching cute Christmas movies.","Brown Mountain Creek Shelter

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605895,"We took up double zero for the snow storm which was around 10” here.  I read a book, watched football and watched lots of Christmas movies.  Both of us wanted to hike on day 2 but road conditions were bad so fortunately we were forced to stay an additional night.  Temperature went below 0 that night.
We planned on starting our hike by 9 but my shuttle Frog’s car would not start.  The temp is 0 here - Ug!  Then I had to stop by the post office to pick up my resupply and got an extra goody box - yum and thanks!  
We started hiking around 10 and conditions were great.  We followed footsteps over the James River Footbridge which was beautiful.  Then the person turned right and we had were the first to break the snow.  Rusty was so excited racing back and forth but after about 20 mins dropped behind me.  The path was flat and followed the James River for about a mile.  It was tiring just walking in the shin deep snow.  We took a break at the Matt’s Creek Shelter which was right on the trail and just over 2 miles from the start.   It was only 11:30 but I actually thought about stopping for the night; we had 12 miles to the next shelter and it was a tough slow walk even on the flat ground. 
We continued on and the path headed up the mountain.  It was beautiful but hard walking through snow that ranged from 6-12” deep.  At around 2 the snow started getting wet and clumping to Rusty.  He started having a hard time getting through it so I had to carry him.  At first I tried to carry him with one hand so I could use one pole but, though only 18 lbs, it became too hard.  I hooked both poles to my bag so I could use both hands.   We came to a rocky patch which just looked like lumpy snow. I fell a couple times so had to put Rusty down.  That worked for awhile but then we got to the top of the mountain where there were thigh deep drifts of snow.  Rusty could not get over those so I started carrying him again.  It was windy and cold now so I had to put my puffy and snow mittens on.  
Through guthooks I saw there was a parking lot coming up in less than 2 miles.  I  decided to get to that and see if I could get a shuttle.  We finally made it down about 5:30 and the parking lot was completely snow covered.  I decided just to put up my tent and stay there.  We had walked less than 10 miles in 7.5 hours and both of us were completely wiped out.  I had never used my tent in the snow so was hoping it would be fine.  Thanks again to Jon for getting me to scotch guard my tent sheet.  
Right after setting it up we crawled inside.  I tried to get all the snow clumps off Rusty but it was hard.  We ate dinner in our tent and then quickly got under our quilt.  It actually is warm and comfy.  We both fell asleep quickly.  Hopefully things go better tomorrow.","US 501 Glasgow

Happy & Yappy now Dorothy and Toto,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605896,"Tent camping in the snow was warm and cozy though hard to pack up.  We were low on water so I had to skip my coffee and oatmeal.  We had some bars which Rusty shared.  Then we packed up in the tent.  The floor did get wet but not flooded.  Packing up the tent was hard because my fingers were frozen.  Once again my shoes were frozen so they were hard to put on too.  Also I was dreading hiking in the wet and deep snow but fortunately Rusty was just excited to be out in the snow.  
The first couple miles were fine just slow and uphill.  There was also trees and branches on the path though not nearly as bad as the Shenandoah.  It was harder to get around them though because of the drifts of snow.  
Once again when the temp warmed up, the snow started clumping to Rusty and I had to carry him.  My calves and really whole body were sore.  While carrying him I pulled the snow off as best as I could.  Then I put him down to walk until the clumps got too big for him to move.  No fun slow process!  
When we got to the next shelter it was 1:30 and we walked less than 5 miles in 5 hours.  I got water and fed Rusty.  I made myself a hot tea since it was too late for coffee.  The next  shelter was 5 miles away so I decided to stay here.  I got more water, hung up my tent and put warm dry clothes on.  Rusty chased birds then laid in the snow.  I started making dinner around 3 and then Rusty hopped up to share.  I took off all Rusty’s snow clumps which took awhile.  I did not want him to go back in the snow so I put his leash on.  Then we ate dinner and I set up our bed.   I started getting chilly so I brushed my teeth and got in bed around 4.  Rusty did hear birds again so is now sitting on top of the covers in guard dog mode.  I wrote my blog and fell asleep by 5.","Petites Gap Parking lot

I made coffee and oatmeal and packed up my nice dry tent.  We watched the sky turn pink and then started hiking.  It was beautiful hiking that morning with the pink line in the sky.  We went under the Guillotine and had a great view from the Black Rock overlook.  The snow was too wet to clump badly on Rusty.  I did have to help him over of few big drifts.  We really had a great day.  We saw tons of wildlife prints.  I thought bears would have hibernated by now however we saw their prints too.  Later I talked to the owner of my hotel and he said female bears and young bears were hibernating however males hadn’t yet.  Rusty enjoyed chasing the many deer and birds that were out.
We saw Forager, who was hiking North, about halfway through the day.  He had decided to go North for the next two sections because of the snow melt on the South side of the mountain.  It was great seeing him and also great because his footprints made the trail so much easier for us.  It’s been harder following the trail with the snow since there is no path to follow.   
I was thinking about stopping at the beautiful Bryant Ridge shelter at the 10 mile point which we got to around 2:30.  I did stop there to feed Rusty and filter some more water.  I decided to hike the next 4 miles to town when I found out it was suppose to start raining tonight or tomorrow morning with temps in the low 40s.
The last 4 miles of the hike were quick since the snow was pretty much melted on the path.   I arrived at my pickup spot at 410 which was way earlier than I expected.  My shuttle, which was the owner of the hotel Wattstull Inn, picked me up.  He was fun to talk to as was the rest of the staff I met.  It is a great hotel that has a restaurant and Shell convenience store right beside it.  I got a burger and salad and Devils Backbone Trail Angel Weiss.  All were great.  Now I’m hoping it just rains tomorrow not the next two days as the forecast shows.","Thunderhill Shelter

We got to the trailhead around 9:30 and started the big climb up the mountain.  Rusty raced around exploring everything.  It was a perfect hiking day.  I wore shorts and a long sleeve.  The mountains were beautiful and the sun sparkling.  We got to our planned stop at 1:30 and decided it was too early to stop so hiked 7.7 more miles to the next shelter.  The trail crisscrossed Blueridge Parkway and did have great overlooks from the road however it was annoying having to watch out for cars.   We walked fast because I wanted to be at the shelter by 4:30 for the start of the game.  We were tired but did make it in time.  A section hiker Don was already at the shelter.  He has hiked from GA to here in sections.
I fed Rusty and set up our bed.  Then I went to get my food and couldn’t find my Jetboil.  I know people hike stove less but definitely not for me especially when cold.  Fortunately Don let me borrow his for the night.  Tomorrow I will pick something up at the next town.

Put on my nice dry and warm shoes and started hiking around 8.  We had a pretty walk through woods with Mountain View’s.  I was warned how bad the trail was through the 20 miles north of Daleville from the ice storm but the trail volunteers had completely cleared the debris.  I saw four out today that were going back through and leveling the path.  It’s amazing how quick and thorough the volunteers are!  I also met Cherokee Rose who helped with the cleanup but today was just enjoying hiking.  She has done 800 miles of the trail and was planning on doing a   thruhike but overextended her knee.  If you read this, your friend’s trail name could be Silver or Silver Rose since her hair is such a pretty shiny silver color. 
Got to Daleville around noon and Ubered to Gander Mountain to buy my stove.  I bought a mini stove and pot which aren’t quite as convenient as my jetboil but much cheaper.  We got back to the trailhead around 2 and had over 9 miles to the next shelter.
Climbed up a mountain then had a beautiful ridge walk overlooking Carvin Cove Reservoir.  The other side overlooked a town with mountains in the background.  We saw a lot of day hikers.  We watched the sunset over the mountains and had to use our headlamp for the last mile.  We got to the shelter and there was a great fire going.  Kevin and Jen were already set up in the shelter.   They did not expect to see anyone else.  Kevin moved to the middle of the shelter so we could take a side - so nice!  Fortunately I set my pad up right next to the side first then went to get water.  When I came back two other guys had arrived and two more would be soon.   Kevin was figuring out shelter spacing and decided to set his tent up, but one of the new guys said he would instead.  I did not want to tent since it’s suppose to start raining tonight.  
It was fun eating dinner with the group.  Jen has backpacked all over.  Kevin just started backpacking.  This is the other 4 guys first backpacking trip.  They said they overpacked but are enjoying it.  We were warned that 3 snore loudly.  It will be an interesting night.","Wilson Creek Shelter

We started hiking around 10 up to Tinker Cliffs.  Unfortunately it was drizzly and foggy so we didn’t have the great views like we had last year but it was actually was a pleasant day for hiking.  Next we headed up to McAfee Knob which was fogged in too.  There were a lot of day hikers up there which surprised me since the weather was bad but we did enjoy seeing them. 
Once we past the McAfee Knob parking lot, we saw no other hikers.  For the first couple miles we walked on a ridge that probably had great views in good weather.  Then we crossed some fields that looked spooky in the fog and walked by a rushing stream.  By the time we got to the road the hostel was on it was getting dark so I put on my headlamp.  The hostel was .4 miles east of the trailhead.  Walking on the foggy dark road and turning in the long driveway to the hostel was creepy.  We were greeted by a big black lab and fireworks.   I was shocked and happy there were other people at the hostel.  Immediately when walking through the door I felt welcomed.  I gave Rusty a quick bath to get the mud off him and then relaxed and talked to everyone.  No one was hiking now; they just stopped by because they love the hostel: Tamborine, Ninja, Florida girl and her daughter Carebear.  There were two cats that lived there that were curious about Rusty as he was of them but neither got to close.
For dinner the hostel owner Joe made us the best venison steaks wrapped in bacon.  I felt so lucky to be included in the feast!   I found out later that the deer was butchered right before I got there right in the room we slept.  Carebear is a vegan and witnessed it though handled it well.  Carebear is 18 and Florida Girls daughter.  She is finishing up her Associates degree this year.  Her mom is going back to school starting next week.  She just sold her computer company and decided she should finish her college degree since she is only 17 credits away.  Kind of a crazy way to start, but she is taking 6 classes this semester; it’s been 20 years since she left college.  One of her classes is at her daughter school which is pretty fun though they said they’ll pretend not to know each other.

Once we passed Dragons Tooth, we stopped seeing day hikers.  We walked on the ridge for awhile and had beautiful views on both sides of mountains and farms and country houses.  Then we had switchbacks winding up a mountain.  We went through a nice pine forest then crisscrossed over a windy creek.  We got to the shelter around 5 and got water.  It got dark as I was filtering the water but not too cold so we enjoyed a nice relaxing dinner.  Unfortunately we don’t get service here so I can’t wish everyone a Happy New Year!   We had a great start to the New Year!","VA 624 Newport Rd

We started hiking around 8 and headed up the mountain.  After about 15 mins I took my puffy jacket off; however closer to the top we were in the clouds or fog and it was cold and wet so I had to put my puffy back on.  We walked along the rocky ridge for miles.  I had to be careful since the rocks were slippery but Rusty darted across chasing birds.  He kept looking back wondering why I was so slow.   I saw a hunter all in camouflage with a gun right off the trail which made me a bit uncomfortable since it was so foggy.  I never did hear gun shots though.  Once we descended out of the fog, it got warm and I took off my puffy.  It’s funny that the change was so sudden.  
We walked through a pasture with a beautiful view of the farm houses and the mountains.  We enjoyed seeing the cows and horses especially since they were on the other side of the fence.  They watched us too probably hoping for treats.

The next part of our walk was through Rhododendron tunnels and over many streams.  There had to be least 10 small bridges and 10 rock crossings.  Nothing spectacularly beautiful but a very pleasant walk.  The last part of the walk was on the side of mountains and on top of the mountains with great views.  It was windy on top but not too cold.  We got to the shelter about 3 which made for a very relaxing night eating and reading.  And I found a pair of readers - wow!  I haven’t lost a pair since before Thanksgiving and now I have a spare.

Unfortunately the shuttle could only take me to the Big Walker Motel since it was their vehicle.   The only food place close is a gas station so we did get some snacks and beer but will have to order dinner.  Found out there’s a Pizza Plus that delivers so ordered pasta, wings and salad.  Now impatiently waiting for the game!Also thanks for the comments in the guest book.  If you don’t leave an email, I can’t thank you personally but I do appreciate the encouraging words!","Jenny Knob Shelter

Our shuttle picked us up at 10 and took us to the trailhead.  We climbed up a gravel road then turned on to a path overlooking Bland.  We continued on the side of the mountain for a couple miles then headed back down.  
We got to Laurel Creek campsite and saw a picnic table and decided to take a coffee break and enjoy the warm day.  As we were sitting there I noticed a plaque: 
In memory of SANDY.
Best hiking dog ever. 
Thanks for the journey
I picked up Rusty and hugged him.  Sandy was my dog that died two years ago.  Her buddy had died four years ago and we got Rusty because Sandy was lonely and had become really anxious.  Once we got Rusty, she went back to being our happy dog.  Sandy was the sweetest dog!   This was such a beautiful spot for that memory and even had a rushing stream for background noise.  
We hiked 5 more miles to our shelter and got there nice and early so we could enjoy a relaxing night.  The wind picked up though so we had to go inside the shelter where the wind was partially blocked.  I don’t get service, but the temperature is definitely dropping even though it is still light.  I’m a bit disappointed because earlier it had said it would be warm until late night though I should just be thankful for the warm Jan day.   I tried my new puffy booties out and they were nice and warm!  I finished my book as Rusty napped.  Then made dinner and got in bed around 6 and started this blog.","US 52 Bland

We got to the Chestnut Knob Shelter and it was beautiful from the outside.  It was on top of the mountain in a field.  It was fully enclosed so we took a nice long warm up break.  I considered staying there because it would have been such a warm place to sleep but it was only noon.  I checked weather and the wind advisory goes until tomorrow morning.  Also the temperature is dropping to the teens tonight so will be a scary night.  Hopefully my shelter is facing opposite of the wind.
For awhile we stayed in a grassy path with great views of the mountains though very windy.  We headed down the mountain and into the Rhododendron tunnels and woods.  We stopped at a stream before the shelter to filter water.  Rusty dozed while waiting however once we got to the shelter played with his bully stick for awhile.  As soon as we got to the shelter I put on warm clothes and picked the side least in the wind.  We set up and ate dinner quickly then cuddled under my quilt.  I can hear the wind howling but am warm which is a relief.  I was a bit worried.  I get service here so am enjoying it while under my quilt.","Jenkins shelter

We woke up to temperatures and wind in the teens and snow flurries.  I had put my water bottles under my quilt but they rolled out and were now solid ice.  I did not feel like filtering water so ate some cliff bars and started hiking.  I put one of my water bottles under my jacket so it would melt.  Rusty drank out of the partially frozen streams.  
The flurries made the hike beautiful but the wind made it hard to stay warm.  Deer were all over so Rusty had a great day keeping them off the path.  We walked for ten miles beside and through private property and enjoyed seeing the cows, horses and farmhouses.  The wind and temperature stayed in the teens but the snow stopped around noon.  Around 2 we walked through Atkins VA and I realized there was a hotel there that allowed dogs that was 100 yards off the trail.  I know we should have kept going but it was too hard to pass up - no wind and warmth!   Tomorrow is suppose to be nice so we will make up the miles tomorrow.  Also the Exon has a Mexican restaurant that was excellent.","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

Rusty was so excited to be on the trail he sprinted way ahead then back to me for awhile.  He’s such a great motivator!  The trees were ice covered and beautiful though hung low over the path so I had to do a lot of ducking or knocking them out of the way.  There was about an inch of snow then a crunchy icy layer over the path at the start.  About noon the path started getting slushy but then we climbed up and it got crunchy again.  Once we were about 4000 ft we were in a fog.  We came down out of that and stopped at the Old Orchard Shelter to sit down in a dry spot and eat.  Once we started up again it was colder and there was a light freezing rain and fog.  We walked faster so we wouldn’t get too wet and cold and made it to the shelter around 430.  I quickly got water, fed Rusty and changed into warm dry clothes.  I did warm up while making dinner but still got in bed right after dinner.  We are now in Grayson Highlands State Park which has wild ponies.  I’ve been looking forward to this section so hopefully it warms up and we’ll see the ponies tomorrow.","Dickey Gap

We stopped at the next shelter for lunch and it was already 11:30 and we had only gone 5 miles.  We started walking again through a pine tunnel.  The snow covered branches were hanging extremely low so I had to duck or push them out of the way.  Then we went back up to the top of the mountain and into a cold fog.

We stopped at Crazy Larry’s hostel which is right on the AT for the night.  Crazy Larry’s pup Sally greeted us on the porch.  Crazy Larry welcomed us in and gave us our resupply boxes along with a soda and some venison he was cooking in his crockpot - yum!  I took a shower and did laundry.  Another great convenient hostel! 
Went to Trail Grill for a dinner and got a great 1/2 burger and salad.  Also got the highly recommended Yeehaw beer.  Tried both the IPA and dunkel and loved both.  Now am sitting at Crazy Larry’s listening to the AT podcast he is included on which is very good.","Lost Mountain Shelter

We started off with a mile walk through town.  There are a lot of fun hiker/biker shops but none were open this early.  Then we headed up into the mountains.  We started off in a nice green forest but as we climbed it became snow covered.  The sun came out for awhile and we had great views of the TN mountains.  Around noon we stopped at a shelter for lunch.  
About ten minutes after leaving the shelter the clouds moved in, the temperature dropped and it started snowing.  I stopped to add a layer and put on my ski mittens.  I warmed up quickly and was really happy it was snow not rain which was what was forecasted.  Also Rusty loves running and pouncing in the snow.
Around 3 the snow stopped.  We got to our shelter around 4 and once again were tired.  It was only about 2 inches of snow but even that makes it harder to walk.  I did hang my damp clothes but don’t think they will dry.  There is a hostel 23 miles away so tomorrow will be a long day but at least I’ll be able to dry everything out.   Around 7 it started raining.  I guess it got warmer but I cannot tell.  It is nice to fall asleep to the rain.","Damascus Crazy Larry’s

I took a long hot shower then unpacked my backpack and hung my stuff up to dry.  I also started laundry.  Then I went downstairs to the bar with Rusty who was invited!  The bartender Crazy Wolf was a thru hiker last year and got here and never left.  The other bartender Lizzy moved here from Miami in July.  She was sitting in a bar in NC and the guy next to her mentioned he was selling his house.  She asked how much and realized how inexpensive it was and bought it never seeing it.  She was a veteran and then a police officer for 16 years and was extremely stressed out.  She quit her job and moved here.  She originally got a job at a nearby brewery but when that went under, Dave offered her the job here.  
I started with venison stew that one of the locals had made then fish and chips.  They both were great.  I tried the recommended IPA, Bearded Iris Homestyle, and loved it.  After eating I could tell Rusty wanted to go to bed so I took him back upstairs.  Then I went back down to the music room where they had the AFC Championship on a huge projector.  Dave is a Pats fan so it was great watching the game with him.  I also met a 2018 thruhiker Rebel who misses the mountains so came back here to see Roan Mt again.  Daryl, the owner of the AT famous barbecue place was here also and does a lot of trail magic too.  Rebel recognized Daryl since last year he drove him to pick up a package.  Fortunately I am taking a zero here since it’s such a great place!","Moreland Gap Shelter

Today started with a steep uphill through the woods to Big Butt Mountain.  Right before the top there was a Big Butt bypass but obviously I didn’t qualify.  Actually though when I was home at Christmas someone said my butt got bigger!  There was a rock climb to the top which was fun.  The views were great from on top too.  
There was another bad weather bypass to avoid a rocky ridge walk.  The ridge walk did take some climbing but was fun and beautiful.  I love ridge walks on clear days!
The snow made the trail beautiful but once again I was ready to stop early.  I decided I could tent tonight even though there was snow on the ground; since i will be in town tomorrow for a zero so can dry everything out. 
We got water around 4:30 then found a spot around 5.  The sun was setting by the time I set my tent up and it started to get cold.  I thought we would enjoy hanging out enjoying the view but no - we got in our tent and made dinner.  I really do prefer my tent .  I think Rusty does too.","Flint Mt Shelter

Woke up nice and early and tried to boil water but could not get my stove to light.  I tried my lighter but could not get that to work either so once again we went with cold breakfast.  The sun was rising while I was packing up.  I did have a hard time trying to take pictures, pack and keep my hands from freezing, but it was a beautiful morning!
The hike started with a steep uphill to the next shelter.  Once again the trail was mostly steep not the nice switchbacks I got use to in VA.  We stopped in a warm sunny spot out of the wind and I fed Rusty and tried again to light my stove.  Once again I failed and also failed at getting my lighter to spark.  I’m guessing that the push button is broken so will by a new lighter in town.
It did start cold but ended a great warm and sunny hiking day.   We really enjoyed stopping and sitting in the sun for nice long breaks.  I actually stopped about halfway through to change my nice warm bedtime socks to the freezing stiff toe sock since I was getting so warm.  
We saw the French Broad River about 2 miles before town.  It was running fast.  The walk down to it was beautiful yet steep.
The AT goes right through town.  We stopped at the dog friendly Spring Creek Tavern.  We met the owners pup Stella, part St. Bernard part pit. Beautilful!  We tried two great beers:  Greenman Funk Jam Pale Ale and Wicked Weed Appalachia Session IPA, and had an awesome bacon burgers!  Then we went across the street and bought my fourth pair of Salomon shoes and bought aquamira water treatment drops.  We stopped at dollar general to buy new glasses.  I love when the trail goes through a town!
We got to the hostel and were greeted by Jeff and his pup Hiker.  I was happy they had a kitchen and went to Hillbilly Market to buy food to make spaghetti.  When I got back Jeff offered me hot buttered rum which was excellent.  He showed me the Karaoke/movie room which gets crazy in season.  Then Ron, who works there, explained how the camp stove worked and that it would take 40 mins to boil water for pasta.  I wish I had looked closer at the kitchen.  I ended up eating around 8, but it still came out great and tomorrow will be nice easy leftovers.","Campsite

We got to a shelter around 2 and stopped for a snack.  When I started to walk again, Rusty did not move.  I felt bad, but because we are meeting Kel tomorrow, we had to continue to the next shelter.  I think the snow drifts wore Rusty out.  Kel is watching him for 4 days while I hike the Great Smoky Mts, dogs are not allowed, which will be a good break for him too.  Although once we started walking again, Rusty was back to watching for birds.  
We did hit a nice grassy mountain top with 360 views but the wind kept me walking fast.  We got to our shelter around 4.  I bought a lighter for the stove and it did work but then the stove flickered out.  I relit it and blocked the wind with my backpack.  It still did not go on strong.  I bought the 4 season canister but I guess that can freeze too so tonight I’ll sleep with that too.  I did get a lukewarm meal which still tasted good.  
I am still a bit chilly under my quilt.  I put toe warmers on my socks and my puffy booties over that which is helping.  Right now Rusty is laying on top of the quit between my legs, but when I’m done this,  I’m pulling my little heater under the quilt to warm me up.  He likes it too for awhile.","Hot Springs

We tried to get up early to see the sunrise on Max Patch, a bald 2 miles away, but couldn’t get moving fast enough in the cold.  I did sleep with my water bottle and did check on it often during the night; however the top must have been out and froze.  I could not unscrew it, so once again no coffee or oatmeal.  
We warmed up on the climb up to Max Patch but once we got there the winds hit.  It was absolutely beautiful though with 360% views of mountains.  Once we got back in the trees on the no wind side of the mountain, we stopped for Rusty’s breakfast and a snack.  
We did climb back up Snowbird Mountain and on to another beautiful bald.  Pretty much the rest of the hike was downhill.  There were some deep snow drifts on top of the mountains that were hard for Rusty.
We got to Standing Bear Hostel around 2:30 and this hostel is great too.  Morgan and Zeus, a rott/lab/pit mix, and Rooney, a Mastiff, greeted us and showed us around.  We are staying in the bunk house which is heated by a log burning stove and is quite toasty!   Laundry is done using a wash board though there is a dryer.  The shower has a rain faucet and felt great.  
After showering and doing laundry, I made a pizza and then sat by the wood stove with 2 other employees Jack and Chris.    Kel found out she could not watch Rusty for the next 4 days when I walked through the no dog not Great Smoky Mountains.    Jack offered to let Rusty stay here.  I knew they watched dogs for hikers but I thought they kenneled them which I could not do to Rusty.  (I got him at the SPCA and he did not do well in the kennel.  He sat in the back of the cage and didn’t move.)  Jack and Chris both said they never put dogs in the kennel unless their owners ask them to.  Rusty could sleep in the bunk house and they would walk him.  Maria the owner came in and discussed it with me.  She would keep him in her house since she has 2 teenage girls that would love to watch him.  Wow - perfect for Rusty and I feel very lucky!  Maria will bring him to the south end of GSM when I’m done which should be Monday.  It will be hard to hike completely alone but at least I won’t have to worry about Rusty being neglected.","Roaring Fork Shelter

I walked about 2 miles then entered the Great Smoky Mts.  I headed up the mountain for the first five miles.  I was grateful to have footprints to follow especially in the shin deep snow drifts.  I met the guy that left them as he was leaving Cosby Knob shelter.  Unfortunately that is where he stopped his walk and there were no more footprints.  Fresh snow is peaceful and prettier but so much harder to walk through.  
The views were great pretty much all day though my pictures are boring without my fox.  I stopped at Tri-corner Knob shelter around 4:30 and added more layers.  I considered stopping there but felt lonely so kept going.  Also I really want to try and finish the 75 miles in 3 days.   I got to the next shelter at 6:30 as it was getting dark.  I put my headlamp on for the last half mile.  The shelter is two stories with barely any room between them - about the same space as bunk beds.   There also is a fireplace in it and a tarp over the front.  I didn’t get water since it was so late and I had enough for dinner.  I didn’t get to crawl into bed until around 8 so late!","Green Corner Road

After Newfound Gap parking lot I  stop seeing people.  I was surprised because it leads to Clingman’s Dome which is highest point on the AT and I thought a popular day hike destination (I found out later that the Clingman Dome parking lot was closed due to snow).  I did see one nobo Villian in that section.  He was also frustrated by how slow the hiking was in these conditions.  
I ended up stopping at 6:40 because I was tired and it was dark.  Also in the Great Smoky Mts you have to sleep in the shelters or campsites and the next one was in 6 miles.  I made dinner with my remaining water.  Then I tried to find the spring to filter more but could not find it in the dark.   Went under my quilt at 8 for another late night,","Pecks Corner Shelter

The rest of the hike was basically just moving fast.  When I got to the Mollie Ridge Shelter, 17 mile point, at 1 I knew I could finish the 29 miles by 7.  I texted Rusty’s sitter but she could not bring him tonight because she is hosting a Super Dog or Bowl Party.  She will bring him at noon tomorrow which is actually earlier than planned.  
Now I just decided to see how quickly I could finish.  I did meet 2 more nobos but really did not want to talk.  I got to Fontana Dam visitors center at 5:15.  I called the lodge for a shuttle which came in a couple minutes.  It’s a beautiful place!  I took a shower and went to their bar for 2 entries and a 6 pack to go.  Got back to my room right in time for the Super Bowl - go Pats!  Tried 2 great NC beer: Nantahala Brewing App Trail Xtra Pale and Boojum Reward Pale Ale.","Silers Bald Shelter

I got a shuttle to the Fontana Hilton, shelter with a shower, flush bathroom and charging station.  Maria, owner of Standing Bear Farm Hostel, drove up right at noon with Rusty.  I was so happy to see him!  Maria said he did well too.  Both her and her daughters walked him and Jack and Chris checked in on him too.  I highly recommend this hostel for dog sitting.  
Rusty was very excited to be hiking again.  He raced around for the first couple miles before calming down.  I love feeling his enjoyment - it really makes everything better!  We walked with great views of the Fontana Lake for the first half of the walk.  It did drizzle off and on for the second half of the walk but it was warm so did not bother me.  We got to our shelter around 5:30 and had a nice relaxing warm night.  I am so happy to have my watchdog back - looking forward to a great night sleep.","Fontana dam visitors center

We got to the NOC, picked up our packages and bought a new filter.  Then I took a shower and did laundry.  We went to the NOC restaurant and had a great bowl of Chili and a chicken rice dish and two great beers: New Belgium Jucy IPA and Nantahala Noon Day IPA.

I met another nobo Twin.  He actually cowboy camped, slept under the stars - no shelter, two nights ago.  He was above the clouds so it did not rain on him however he did wake up damp in the middle of the night, but went back to sleep and was dry in the morning.  Pretty great sleeper!  I did want to try cowboy camping because how beautiful to be able to look up and see the stars all night; however I realized I could never sleep like that.  I need at least the protection of my tent.  I mentioned how much I’m enjoying the warm weather and he grumbled a bit saying except for our full backpacks.  That made me laugh and realize one more reason to like the cold - we wear most of our clothes.
I had decided when it’s not freezing I need to make the effort and tent since I prefer it.  Even though it was drizzling, I saw a site that should have a great sunrise so put up our tent.  Of course as I was putting it up it started to really rain.  I quickly finished setting up then threw everything inside.  Maybe not a great idea but we did enjoy our dinner in the tent with the rain hitting our tent.  Hopefully it’s sunny for sunrise.","NOC

We stopped at a spring off the path and out of the wind to filter water and make coffee and oatmeal and feed Rusty.  It was great timing because shortly after that it began to sleet.  It got colder, windier and foggy.  The rest of the day it was either raining or sleeting and no fun.  Around 2 we stopped at a shelter to get out of the wind and rain and eat.  It was tempting to stay there but I’d rather tomorrow be a shorter day since I’m stopping in town and it’s suppose to rain for the next 2 days.
