Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583595,"I've been asked: Why do you want to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail? I have also read that you should document your reasons before departing so you can reflect on them when you face challenges or get discouraged. So here, in no particular order, are some of the many reasons for this adventure.
Peace of mind. From an early age I have found the woods to be a tranquil place where I feel at peace. No matter what the conditions rain, wind, snow, cold or heat. I enjoy the spiritual nature of the great outdoors.
Adventure. I like to face new challenges and situations and learn how to adapt and overcome them. It feels fantastic to witness sights and experience far off places that very few people have the opportunity, capability and perseverance to see.
Challenge. I have been fortunate to experience some great challenges in my career and personal life and its always exciting and rewarding. This is certainly a major challenge, walking 2190 miles with everything I need to survive on my back. This is the equivalent of 86 marathons, a noteworthy challenge. It will be energizing to meet this challenge. 
Perseverance. My wife and I always told our kids they could do anything they put their minds to, this is my opportunity to lead by example.
Purpose. I have taken a bit of a sabbatical since I retired. While I certainly have enjoyed my time off this has given me a real sense of purpose. It has been all consuming in a way but I have enjoyed every minute.",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Sun",0
Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583597,"Reading and watching YouTube.  I have spent countless mornings waking up at 4 am to read Trail Journal updates and watch YouTube videos about the AT. I have also read numerous books on the subject. It's probably too difficult to list the books. However, I do want to thank some of the people here on Trail Journals and on YouTube who have inspired me and taught me a great deal about how to prepare for a long distance hike. To name a few of my favorites (in no particular order)....2015-3D, Airlock; 2016-Teodactyle, El Tajano, Subman & Suds, Bombaldi, Blue, Rabbit, Slipnot, Northstar, Hooshr & Forrest and Coach; 2017 Ghosthiker, Mrs. Joy, Phoenix, Scout and GI Joe; 2018-Mighty Blue (pod cast) Vagabond Jack and Opa. From YouTube-Redbeard, Dixie, Wired, Darwin on the Trail, Early Riser and Bigfoot. Thanks to all of you for your help and encouragement.
Shopping for gear.  I made countless trips to REI, spent hours on Amazon and researching boutique sites like Zpacks, and made trips to my local outfitter of choice-RRT. I researched, read reviews, tested, weighed and customized gear. I hope I have made good choices that will help me enjoy the experience. 
Practice hikes and gym time. I started with practice hikes two years ago. I started carrying my actual gear a 3-4 times a week a few months ago. I purposely tried to test myself in all of the conditions I will experience on the trail. I logged a fair amount of gym time too to work on my core fitness and my stamina. I hope it was enough!",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Sun",0
Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585060,"Day 1 & 2 The Journey to GA My journey began with the drive to Amicalola Falls State Park in northern Georgia.  My wife and I decided to stop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on our way to the southern starting point of the AT as we had honeymooned at the  Smokey Mountain National Park several years ago.  We enjoyed a nice leisurely drive through the park. After a while we decided to return to the hotel and go out for dinner as we knew we would be driving through the park the again next day on the way to Amicalola Falls.  Much to our surprise we rose the next morning to find snow on the ground and the Smokey Mountain Parkway closed due or snow and ice on the mountains.  We adjusted our route and arrived later that day at the Amicalola Visitor Center.  I checked in with the ranger.  He signed me in, gave me a hiker number, a tutorial on what to expect on the trail, how to stay safe, and the equipment that he expected me to have in my pack.  It was a fairly through overview.  Next we proceeded outside to take the traditional pictures at the start of the AT approach trail under the archway.  Walking toward us on the trail was the first person we met, “Sub Man.”  (An eight time through hiker of the trail). I have read a lot about him in the trail journals.  He gave me some good words of support on starting my hike and wished me well.  This was a bit of serendipity.  At the suggestion of the ranger we drove to the top of the mountain and checked in at the lodge.  Then we decided to hike the 600+ steps of the approach trail that is along the falls to get them out of the way before the next day.  We walked the side trail back down the mountain to the start of the approach trail.  The experience was a taste of what was yet to come. When we started up the 600+ step staircase we realized that my wife had dropped her glasses on the way down the mountain. We reversed course and went back up the side trail. Fortunately we found the glasses but they were 3/4 of the way back up the mountain trail. We were really fortunate to find the glasses in good shape and like new.  It was a rigorous hike that left us both a bit surprised.  The stairs would have to wait for the next day.  We had had a wonderful time that left me questioning my sanity in walking the trail for the next 6 months.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Tue",0
Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585392,"As many of you know there are two ways to get to Springer Mountain, the official start of the Appalachian Trail, from the southern terminus.  The traditional way is to take the 8.8 mile approach trail from Amicalola Falls State Park.  Tradition is that you hike a 600+ step staircase beside a magnificent waterfall.  This trail then proceeds up hill most of the way to Springer Mountain.  There is an alternative approach route which is to drive in on a forestry service trail and then hike one mile back down to the start at Springer Mountain. Viewpoints differ on if you should strain yourself before the official beginning of the trail or if you can’t do the approach trail then how would you ever be able to hike the 2190 mile trail.  I chose to take the approach trail from Amicalola Falls.  Ultimately I am glad I did.  On the way up, I met John who I read about here on “Trail Journals” and his longtime friend the 18 year old nephew who courageously decided to join the hike only 2 weeks ahead of time.  We had a good time hiking Springer together and reached the sign and official registry.  Of course we took pictures of this.","Approach Trail + Springer Mountain

Neel Gap is the first restock stop on the trail and the location that 25% of the hikers decide that the trail is not for them.  There is a tree loaded with hiking shoes on the branches that people have thrown up in the tree when they give up the trail.
 A requirement in this area of the trail is that you must have a hard-shell bear resistant canister for overnight hiking between Jarrard Gap and Neel Gap even with the safe practice of hanging your food and anything in a tree for your safety.
I will get off the trail at Neel Gap to stock up on food and regroup.  Will go to Blairsville to stay in warmth for a night.  I will continue the trail.","Jarrad Gap

Albert. 
 Albert has a severe climb just before it so it was a long day at 11.8
miles according to climb to the tower.  Pace was fairly slow but we made steady progress winding up today at Longbranch
shelter. The views from Albert were fantastic. We were surprised when we
climbed the fire tower only to find that it was locked but nevertheless
we got some good photo opportunities. Today was the first day where we had
really nice weather.  I was able to hike in a T-shirt and shorts. After 10 days of
sleeping in freezing cold and rain it was well deserved. Tonight we expect it to rain and
have a short hike of about 7 miles into town. Thanks to my lovely wife for
making all the arrangements for us and advance.","

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585414,"We woke up to a gentle rain as expected and broke camp
around 8 am. At least it was a warmer night in the 30’s. It never ceases to
amaze me how long it takes to get ready. Essentially you have to dry,
clean all your belongings, retrieve your
bear bag from the tree and carefully pack everything into your compact pack.
The rain makes it especially challenging. We left without eating breakfast in
order to warm up. That meant no coffee and I was especially tired since I was
woken by a coyote several times which was very close to my tent. I was camped
at the bottom of a big hill by myself (since the limited number of camping
spots were mostly taken by a college group) which made it quite eerie.  When I came up the hill the other campers were asking me how close it was to my tent. I don’t really know but... let’s just
say close enough. We had a small group including Tabasco, Pass Me, Bubs and
Stub. We decided to take a Nero (low mile day and get to town to beat the
impending weather). 
We visited the local outfitters, Outdoor 76.  Tabasco and I
were fitted with new shoes. The owner was very technical and changed our shoe
setup to increase our foot wellness which is very important at this point on
the trail. It was an interesting experience.","

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585417,"Today we found ourselves holding up in town to avoid the
rain and snow that is moving into the area. We decided to make the best of
things by catching a shuttle to Wayah Gap and slack packing back to Rock Gap
where we got off the trail the day before. Slack packing is a process where you
use day packs (provided by the local outfitters who dropped them at our hotel)
to make the hiking easier. The lighter load really made the big climbs feel
much easier. We covered about 10.1 Miles in about 5.5 hrs.  That is a terrific pace on this terrain.
Toward the end we kicked on the afterburners in order to catch the 12:45 pm shuttle instead of waiting in the cold for the next shuttle at 3:30 pm. It was fun
to see the group members push themselves. One of the highlights of the day was
that we hiked SOBO (southbound) so we got to see several hikers that we have
passed off and on over the past 10 days including Tortoise and Hare, Ramblin
Man, Ringo, and several others. The afternoon was spent doing laundry and
enjoying a BBQ dinner. I got to talk to my wife and one of my daughters which
made my day.","

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585416,"Today we took a zero day (no miles) to avoid a fresh snow
fall of 4-6 inches in the surrounding mountains. The weather advisory warned
hikers to come off the AT. We did see a few hikers go back out on the trail but
far more were coming into town. Tabasco saw a hiker that he knew coming into
town. He reported the conditions on Wayah Bald as treacherous. We spent the day
doing town chores including shopping, shipping unneeded items home. We had an
enjoyable dinner at a local BBQ spot. We plan to go back out tomorrow but
delayed our shuttle until 9am to give it time to warm up. The most notable item of
the day was when a member of our trail family for the last few days had a
friend pick her up at the hotel. Her AT journey is over. We wish her fair winds
as she returns home to St. Louis.","

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585422,"After our zero day in Franklin we were eager to hit the
trail again. Although I must admit, we were a bit apprehensive because of the
snowfall on the mountain. So we pushed back our start time to 9 am to give it
time to warm up. It never did. We hiked to the summit and took pictures from
Wayah Fire Tower. The tower roof burned in the forest fire two years ago. I
should have mentioned we have been walking the burned areas from time to time
for the past three days. We continued to hiked thru 3-4 inches of snow with
occasional drifts of 2-3 feet. We arrived at our original destination of Cold
Spring shelter around 3 pm and had lunch. After a split vote we decided to push on for another 3 miles to Tellico Gap in order to stay warm longer. We
pitched our tents in a small parking area to keep sheltered from the wind. It’s
7:30 and we’re all bundled up in our tents waiting for dark to arrive and
hoping to stay warm. 
Mileage was off so I made a one time adjustment here to correct.","
",Tellico Gap,"Mar 22, Thu",59.80
Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585413,"It was freezing cold throughout the night and we were all
suffering from the conditions. We broke camp earlier than expected. We camped at Tellico Gap in the turnaround area in the parking lot for wind block. We
had what we thought that was a short easy downhill hike into the Nanthalhla Outdoor Center aka NOC. It turned out to
be a very challenging hike that was mostly downhill for approximately 7 miles. Gap is the
southern term for valley.  So anytime you start in a gap you know that you will have a climb at the beginning of your day. The outdoor center is a major kayak and canoe destination.   We saw several hikers we knew there, including Flobo Soho. I met him on a shuttle into Franklin.  We discovered that we went to the same
high school in Indiana. It never ceases to amaze me what a small world we live in when it is so large.  So many times in my life I have run into people I know in unusual places. We also saw Ringo and a nice couple from Australia and last but not least Beans. Beans is a interesting 18-year-old young man
who is hiking by himself. We call him Beans because he carries a can of Bushes Baked Beans in his pack. It is a tradition he started with his friends
when they camped together.  We went to the
diner and had lunch and then proceeded to our lodging. Everyone we talked to
was surprised by how a challenging the hike was and many were commenting about
having sore knees. One section was practically treacherous. It was a steep rock
climb covered by snow and ice from the previous snowfall. We had to use
teamwork and help each other through the obstacles. Another great day on the trail.","
",NOC,"Mar 23, Fri",13.90
Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585412,"Today began on a sad note. One of the leaders of our group
whose trail name was Go Ahead Pass Me left the trail to return to Boston to
attend to some family matters.  So our
trail family “tramily” has dwindled to four members.  The rest of us gathered for breakfast at the
diner at NOC for one last town meal before heading to the trail again. Before we
left town we went to the local outfitters to print our permits for the smoky
mountains. More on that later. We only planned to hike 7 miles today because we
knew it was a really long uphill climb starting at approximately 1500 ft and
going up to over 5500 ft. I seem to prefer the up hills while other members of
the group especially Tabasco do better on the down hills. We arrived at camp
around 3:30 pm and debated pushing further but elected to go ahead and make
camp for the day. We expected a crowd when we arrived.  But to our surprise there were only about a
dozen campers there. Many more arrived after we got set up. The camp is now
very full. As we ate dinner a thunderstorm broke out and we were pelted with
thunder and lightning for a period of time. It is 7:00 pm and I am in my tent doing my best to keep my gear dry. Fortunately most of the snow has melted now
making today’s hike a bit easier. I have now been on the trail for 16 days. But every one of them rainy or had very low temperatures in the single digits with
windchill at night. Ready for some warmer weather.","NOC

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585409,"We had another hail storm last night. We had to pack up in a light drizzle. We
walked through the clouds and fog for several hours before it started to clear
up. We planned on hiking half way to Fontana Dam so we
will be set up to go through the Smokies on Tuesday. It turned out to be
another challenging day with two of steepest climbs yet. We pressed on to an
unofficial site at Hogpin Gap for a total of 11.1 miles. Space was very limited
at camp. We are literally set up across the trail. Hopefully, none will come
through at night. We should be up before anyone passes by in the morning. A few
days ago I met a hiker named Flobo who went to the same high school as me albeit several
years later. He started calling me Kingsman after our high school ...  the name is a bit better than the one my
trail family bestowed on me so I guess it will stick. Tonight it is a bit
milder... a welcome change.","

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585405,"The high winds made the night colder than expected. We had
camped in a small space which was just large enough for our tents. So there was
barely enough room for hikers to pass. We got up early to move out of the
way and so we could start hiking to get warmed up. One hiker did pass through
at about 5:30 am with his headlamp on. It took me quite a while to warm up. My
fingers felt like frozen sausages. I kept them in my pockets to try to warm
them. Tabasco and I took off trying to make good time to Fontana Dam while Papa
Dale and Bubs walked at a more relaxed pace. PD was nursing a blister. Once
again NC proved to be challenging with some steep ups and downs. These are
called PUDS.  Pointless Ups and Downs
because you can see your destination but the terrain requires you to wind your
way up and down and around the mountain. We went through some really cool rock
scrambles and had several spots where we got good views of Fontana Lake and
Dam. Tabasco and I arrived at the Fontana Marina and waited for about an hour
for the others to arrive before calling the shuttle to pick us up and deliver
us to the Fontana Lodge. The is the nicest place we have stayed so far. Upon
our arrival we did laundry showered and had dinner. Mileage for the day was 9.1
Miles. Tomorrow we will resupply, dry out our gear, and rest.","
",Fontana Dam,"Mar 26, Mon",9.10
Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585400,"We were up and caught the first shuttle back to Fontana Dam
where we exited the trail. We walked 2 miles to the Fontana Hilton the alias
for the nicest shelter on the trail. It comes complete with indoor plumbing and
a shower. We took a few photos of Fontana dam. The tallest dam at over 480 ft.
Today the weather is supposed to be nice. It is only the
second time the sun has poked through the clouds since we started on March 8th.
It was a pleasant surprise as we officially entered the Smokies. We climbed
nearly 4000 feet in our 13 mile journey to Mollies Ridge Shelter. While not
exceptionally steep it was challenging as evidenced by the large number of people
camped here. I counted nearly 20 tents in addition to the shelter which is
full. The rules in the Smokies require thru hikers to use the shelters. So
tents are only allowed for the overflow. A large bear has been spotted at this
shelter the past two days so we are being vigilant in hanging our food on the
bear cables. Hopefully we won’t have any unwanted visitors tonight. Shooting
for another 12 mile day tomorrow. We should pass the 200 mile marker in two
days.","

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585399,"Well luckily the night was uneventful with no unwanted 400
lbs visitors. It was by far the nicest weather to tent in so far. In the Smokies
there is no camping allowed other than at the designated shelters and a few
isolated tenting sites so your hiking mileage is dictated by their location.
Today we had two shelters that were only an hour or two away and another
shelter at 13 miles so we elected to go 13 miles on back to back days. Lots of
people are doing those distances routinely but most of them are complaining of
injuries and walking around camp with the hiker hobble. So we have elected to
be conservative when possible.  Clingmans
Dome is the highest elevation on the AT at about 6600 ft and it is 10 miles
away so tomorrow promises to be an adventure. We are expecting heavy rain
tonight so we are hoping that the views will still be good. If not, we may elect
to have a short day tomorrow and summit on Saturday if we have enough
food.  We summited a few hills today with
good but hazy views. Well worth the work to get there. With wind gusts of 35-40 mph it was a challenging but rewarding day.","

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585398,"Once again a large storm hit around bedtime. 8pm is hiking midnight. I only saw lightning once but it seemed close. We woke at daybreak and
decided to meet at a shelter 7.4 miles down the trail to set our final goal for
the day. Clingmans Dome was just ahead and we knew it would be a challenge
because it is the highest point on the AT. We stopped at the shelter and set up
camp because Tabasco’s sleeping bag was soaking wet from the night before.
After a while we realized it wasn’t going to dry because we were in a fog bank
and it was very damp.  That’s where
everything went bad. We decided hike to Clingmans and get a ride to Gatlinburg.
As soon as we left it started to sleet. We got to Clingmans and found the road was
closed so the only way out was to hike 7 miles down the road to the highway to
be picked up. It was a long cold walk which brought our mileage for the day to
17 miles. We arrived in Gatlinburg to find it was Spring Break and no rooms
were available. The Marriott called numerous hotels before finding us a room in
Pigeon Forge. The cab took us to the
wrong location. Had to get a second cab. The hotel wasn’t what I had hoped for.
I’ll spare you the details. A late pizza and shower and finally made it to bed
around midnight. A full day indeed. It was a bit harrowing at times but I am

a hotel planning to zero. At breakfast Papa Dale said it was the first nice day
and we should be on the trail. So we went back to the room and packed up to hit
the trail. Since we had hiked some of the way the day before, our hike was
modest today. The weather was beautiful and the sights were spectacular.  A welcome change. We tried to have the driver
take us back to Clingmans so we could take some pictures but traffic was backed
up for over a mile. We dropped back in at Newfound Gap where we left off. Lots
of tourists there who were fascinated by the thru hikers. The trail was full of
day hikers which frustrated some of the thru hikers because they don’t follow
trail etiquette. The uphill hike should have the right of way. In the Smokies
section thru hikers have priority in the shelters. All the thru hikers are packed
in a tent city. Another sore spot. Everyone is eager to get out of the Smokies

One member of our group has been slowing down a bit the past day or so. He was really moving well until now. He arrived at camp late yesterday and it was dark before he was able to set up and eat dinner. We offered to wait for him but he said he was going to take his time. I imagine he will stop at the first shelter at 7.4 miles while we decided to press on To Tri-Corner Knob Shelter so we can get out of the Smokies sooner. Today offered the best scenery yet!  Lots of nice vistas with clear views. The terrain was more moderate but we still had several long gradual climbs through out the day. I particularly enjoyed walking through the pine forest which were abundant in this area. The fragrance was fantastic.

After enjoying a cup of coffee, a rare experience for me on the trail, we walked a short distance down the trail to find a beautiful cascading waterfall. We proceeded down the trail to Standing Bear Farm Hostel and thought about staying for a while but decided to resupply and look down the trail. I was supposed to pick up a new jacket here from outdoor research to replace the one that failed. This is the second time that they failed to mail it to me as agreed. Quite disappointing. In addition to the poor customer service I have found the rain jacket to be poor in rain resistance compared to the other jackets I’ve seen on the trail. It is as lightweight as ever, but all in all it is been my biggest gear disappointment so far. After leaving Standing Bear Farm we hiked approximately three hours up a long uphill trail with over 2000 foot of elevation gain. At the top there was a bald from which you could see long distances. A FAA Center was located on top of the Bald. The day ended with a nice 2.5 mile jaunt into camp. Groundhog Creek Shelter is not very impressive compared to the others we have seen.","Stealth camp

We progressed up the steep incline as the sleet and fog continued to roll in. My rain jacket soaked through quickly and I started to become colder and colder. I worked my way to the front of the pack quickly in order to stay warm. Around 10:30 we ran into a southbound section hiker who just had a ride from a well-known shuttle driver named Wild Bill. We decided to call Wild Bill and get a ride down the mountain out of the precipitation. After about 45 minutes he picked us up and gave us a ride into Hot Springs. Our plans of the 13 mile hike had quickly morphed into a Nero. This actually made sense because we did not have enough food when we left Standing Bear Farm. We found accommodations, went to lunch, did laundry and showered before going out to dinner. We met an interesting guy named Tom and two of his four sons who were thru hiking. The older two left the trail to go home but the younger two are still on the trail as part of their homeschool program.
The days never really work out as we plan but things always seem to turn out OK. Tomorrow we will take a shuttle back up the mountain to cover the ground that we bypassed.

We were going to shuttle back to Max Patch Road and hike 21 miles back into Hot Springs. We would have the advantage of carrying lighter packs since we could leave no essential gear behind for the day. As usual things didn't go according to plan. Our shuttle driver overslept and it was nearly 11 am before we were transported back to Max Patch by a different shuttle driver. Ya Ya was the new driver. Quite the character, he hiked here from Springer Mountain several years ago and realized he wasn't prepared to complete a thru hike. So he stopped here and made Hot Springs his home. Our arrival on Max Patch was a major contrast to the day before when we faced frigid temperatures, sleet and heavy fog that limited any hope for a view. Today was bright, clear and relatively warm a we could see for miles. Max Patch is a bald (mountain top above the tree line) that offers a 360 degree view. I saw a hiker who somehow found wood to build a small fire to enjoy lunch around. She looked very tranquil. We hiked at a fast pace to try to make up the distance. It was mostly downhill but still featured two long climbs. By the time we arrived at Garenflo Gap it was apparent we would need to night hike and possibly miss dinner in town if we didn't find a ride. We decided to eat the rest of our lunch and work out a plan when Mike a day/section hiker came out of the woods. He had just enough space in his truck to accommodate us.

We had a nice breakfast and then we picked up Tabasco and Papa Dale for the hour drive from Asheville back to Hot Springs. We planned to arrive at 9 am so I could see if the post office had received my rain jacket that was supposed to have been at the last three stops. The tracking number said it would be delivered by noon but we couldn’t wait around any longer. It wasn’t there so I forwarded it home. If you don’t open a package the PO will forward it to another destination for free. Lots of hikers bounce items down the trail that way. But I was just tired of messing with it and my wife brought me a better jacket from home.
I do want to give a shout out to my local outfitter of choice. RRT in Milford, OH. Its owned by former thru hikers who know the ins and outs of the trail. They have followed up on the jacket warranty numerous times. The big box guys have a great selection but can’t match these guys for knowledge and service.Back to the hike. Town and Gap mean the same thing. They both mean you are at the bottom of the mountain and you will be making a long climb out. Town has an additional meaning though...it means your pack will be full of supplies too. Today was proof. My pack was the heaviest it’s been. We climbed from 9:45 until around 2 when we summited and stopped for lunch. We had some spectacular views especially looking back on Hot Springs and the French Broad River. We finally rolled into the camp around 3:30. It was foggy in camp and became cold quickly. So we had dinner and settled into our tents to stay warm.

The morning miles went by fast although it was all up hill and my energy level was low for some reason. The afternoon miles went slow but we went over some very technical rock climbs that I really enjoyed. When we reached the top we were treated to some fantastic views. Too bad I can only post one picture a day. Did you notice the ending mileage today? We passed the 300 mile marker!
Met Picasso and Oven today, two young ladies in their 20’s. They talked to me about their dads who are my age and I told them about my daughters who are their age. Nice young ladies. Also met Shawn and another section hiker, both around my age and from Florida. The mountains here are a stark contrast to what they are used to at home. I enjoyed hiking with them.

We met some on the NC Trail Maintenance pub and had a nice chat with them. The afternoon was much more challenging with some long climbs. We caught back up with Easy Spirit at a road crossing and he called for a shuttle into Franklin TN because his plantar fasciitis was hurting badly. I suffer from it too, and mine also started acting up. I think it is tied to the steep climbs the past few days. We made it to camp around 4:15 and decided to call it a day rather than push on. We were tired and Papa Dale was still a couple of miles back according to passing hikers. We decided it was best to wait for him and make sure he was ok. He arrived about and hour and a half later.

The room I slept in was small and packed full of people. Tabasco and three others slept on the kitchen floor. That was better than the bunk room where I slept....er tried to sleep. It was a leaky wood building with no heat. It was probably my coldest night yet on the trail. My water bottle was frozen solid. It was so dark inside that I felt like I was in a coffin while I was in my sleeping bag. This was the first time I ever felt claustrophobic. When we left the hostel this morning the temperature was around 20 degrees but at least the 40 mph winds had subsided. We had a 2000 foot climb over six miles. If I did that on the step machine at the gym I would be quite proud of myself.  Here it’s just another day. Some of the views were spectacular. But the wind would kick up at times and melting ice would fall from the trees and pelt you. Ouch!  After 12 miles of hiking in the snow one of the guys was exhausted. We caught a ride to the Mountain Harbor B&B/ Hostel.  This is a whole different experience than the night before. It is clean, nice and warm too.

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589316,We woke up and enjoyed the spectacular views from Hilltop Meadow. The full moon which illuminated our tent throughout the night was still on the horizon. What a great way to enjoy your morning coffee. We passed back over Mt Rogers and past Buzzard Rock again. We reentered the forest and went over a hard rocky section before the trail finally relented and gave us a break. We stopped in a beautiful pine grove for lunch.   The fragrance reminded my daughter of Christmas. It was really fun hiking with Papa Dale and my daughter.  We passed by the shelter where we tented during our last-time through and I enjoyed telling my daughter about our previous journey through this section of trail.  There were several awesome tent sites as we hiked but wanted to get closer to Damascus to make our hike tomorrow easier.  Oops!!  We didn’t find another spot until four miles down the trail.  We kept thinking that we felt good and that there would soon be another close campsite.  Boy were we wrong.  We ended up hiking 17 miles for the day.  This was new record for my daughter.  I was proud of her tenacity.  We finally made camp on the banks of the Laurel River and we enjoyed a nice campfire. Our bear bag was hanging from the bottom of a nearby bridge as we went to sleep.  I am looking forward to my wife arriving tomorrow.  It was a perfect ending to a perfect day.  A perfect day was on the horizon for tomorrow.,"

It was really hard to look down and watch them drive away with the realization that it would be a long time before I would see them again.  Others are bothered by blisters, shin splints, knee injuries etc. but for me the biggest challenge the trail has thrown at me is the emotional challenge of being away from my loved ones for so long.  I have traveled extensively and been away from home frequently in my life, but I have never been away for an extended period like this. 
Well back to the trail.....
We walked along ridge line before reaching a nice suspension bridge over a small river.  It delivered us onto a highway and we knew that a popular hiker stop, Trent's, was just down the road in a half mile.  The day was hot so a cold pop sounded awesome and I wanted to see Trent’s.  Out went the thumbs.  It a few minutes a pickup with a flat bed trailer pulled up.  The driver said hop on and we did!  I don’t think he even came to a complete stop.  It was slightly dangerous and really fun.  There were a half dozen hikers in front of Trent’s when we pulled in and they were all cheering us on and laughing.  The driver just hopped out of the cab and walked in.  Hilarious!!  We had lunch and talked to some of the locals.  It was really quite interesting.  After leaving our happy time there, we hiked about three miles to Dismal Falls where a group of younger hikers were enjoying the waterfall.  We had time to set up our tents and have dinner before the rain storm arrived.  It wasn’t supposed to hit until tomorrow. But for now I am safe warm and dry at Wapiti Shelter.  Many years ago a couple was murdered at a Shelter with this same name on a nearby trail.  As I understand it, the old one was torn down and this new one was built.

It is one of the oldest on the AT and is well known for their garden to table dinners. Since we were just in Marion we wanted to stay on the trail. We made it to the first shelter early. It had a brand new deck built on it, the first one I have seen.  We could hear the thunder in the distance.  We had to make a decision; sit in a shelter all day or make a mad dash over 10 miles to town.  Off we went.  Soon everyone we encountered was saying hotel and hostel was booked up.  No Name and Earl Gray contacted me and told me where they were. We checked our Guthook App and decided to head for the MacArther Inn where Earl Gray was staying.  As soon as we emerged at the trail head the sky opened up.  Spirit Man was there trying to get a ride to Pearisburg.  Our shuttle driver showed up in a pickup to take us to our hotel in Narrows.  It was raining so hard we asked him to take Spirit Man to his hostel. He had to ride in the back of the pickup.  It was a torrential rain.  I really felt bad for him hunkered down in the back of the pickup but at least he got to the hostel quickly. As the name implies Spirit Man is a minister so he had faith that things would work out.  An admirable quality.  We raced through showers and laundry and joined Spirit, (different person) Donut, Earl Gray, Purple Haze, Red Hot and his girlfriend (sorry I forgot her trail name) for dinner.  The storm arrived during dinner.  It was spectacular.  Glad I was not in my tent.","Wapiti Shelter

It was a good thing we were warned of the impending storms.  We experienced a heavy thunderstorm on Saturday evening and again early Sunday morning.  The local river was up about 3 feet as the owner of MacArther Inn drove us up the mountain to slack pack back to Narrows VA.  We made a last minute decision to slack pack because of the weather and the long distance to the next resupply point.  We wanted to lighten the load.  Alan Neely owner of the Inn is an interesting character.  He did construction and high risk mining before retiring and buying the Inn.  He bought the Inn to save if from demolition.  We talked about our mutual contacts in the industry.  He looked somewhat surprised by the amount of water rushing off the mountain.  His reaction was not lost on me.  I wondered what we would experience in our hike for the day.
As he dropped us off he said, ""Be careful, looks dangerous.  If you can’t get through call me."" 
 We got out and met a hiker going NOBO he said the creek was 15 feet wide and waist deep. He was going to the road to walk around the hazard.  We went up the trail and took a look for ourselves.  We could hear boulders rolling over in the current.  (Not a good sign.)  Good thing we were going SOBO today. In the first two miles we had about 5 river crossings that would normally only require stepping over a few rocks.  Today we hade to go though the woods to a safer place to cross.  It was hard work.  It took us two hours to go the first two miles.  The trail had 3-4 inches of water flowing down it in places.  We finally reached the ridgline and the hiking got easier.  Well, until the rain pelted us again.  We ended up walking through three rain storms.  When we finally reached the trail head where Alan picked us back up and drove us to Burger King for dinner.  Nothing else was still open on Sunday night. We chatted with Earl Gray and Purple Haze and prepped for another day of potential rain.
Coming south we ran into several hikers we had lost track of including Swimmer, Jack Rabbit, Napoleon and others. We also saw Spiritman and we were glad he found shelter after we dropped him off the day before.","Peters Mountain Trailhead

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589700,"Today Earl Gray and Purple Haze were going to do the same slack pack we did yesterday.  For their sake, I was hoping the rain runoff had subsided.  We still needed to resupply and they were doing a much longer hike than us so we let them take the first shuttle.  We were starting at the same location but there was only room for three in the pickup truck.  The hotel owner, Alan Neely, returned for us around 9:30, so we had another late start but we were only targeting 13 miles for the day so it wasn’t a problem.  We we very surprised at how much lower the creeks and river were in just one day.  Still the first crossing was too hazardous.  If you fell in the water, there was little chance for survival if you were swept into the deep water just 30 yards downstream.  We had a bad climb in the morning.  Where the trail wasn’t muddy it was rocky.  So despite the shorter mileage, it was still a challenging day.  Just to make things a bit more exciting we got to hike in another strong downpour.  I have finally learned to just embrace the bad weather.  As they say.  No Rain.  No Pain.  No Maine.  When we reached the shelter only  BoBo and one other hiker were there.   We were surprised that the 5-6 hikers that passed us had kept going through the tough weather.  I tented and the others stayed in the shelter.  Of course, it rained again as we ate dinner.  So I get to carry a wet tent tomorrow.  I guess I should learn to embrace the shelters along with the weather.  Warm and mostly dry in my sleeping bag now.  It’s hiker midnight, otherwise known as 9 PM so it’s time to turn in.","Peter's Mountain Trailhead

In this case, some of the views are being hidden by tree foliage. This morning's hike went by quickly.  We had covered more than 10 miles when we broke for lunch under the Keffer Oak Tree. It is supposed to be the largest Oak alongside the southern half of the AT.  It is over 300 years old.  We also stopped at an outstanding view at Kelly’s Knob. I don’t like heights so I was proud of myself for jumping over the cravas to get out on the point. The afternoon hike was difficult to say the least.  The two large climbs for the day were both over 1500 feet which took its toll on us.  The water stops were 6-8 miles apart which translates to; we had to carry extra weight.  I was dead tiered when we rolled into camp after nearly 11 hours of hiking.  On the bright side, we had two or three vistas with outstanding views of the mountains to the southeast.  They seem to have a different ridge line which is impressive and they look like they are covered in green velvet.  The day ended with a long ridge walk which was impressive and offered fantastic views of both sides of the mountain.  We also passed the eastern Continental Divide marker.  A long day filled with numerous points of interest and best of all no rain today!","Warspur Shelter

We waited for him about an hour at lunch and he didn’t show so I was concerned.  I reached out to him later and he did make it to the road and was able to get a ride to assistance.  If you get hurt on the mountain your quickest way to help is to hike to a road.  It is very hard for outside assistance to reach you. I hope he is ok and is able to continue. 
Our first point of interest was the Audie Murphy Monument.  He was the most decorated soldier in WWII and died in a plane crash at that location.  Visitors leave tributes at the site.  After a relaxing lunch beside a small river we made another long climb to the ridge line and walked down a couple of rocky ledges that offered splendid views of the mountains that we had crossed earlier in the day. It is rewarding to see how far you have walked. We reached a significant milestone when we crossed the 700 mile marker.  Now it is only 40 miles to the 1/3 mark.  Finally, we climbed to the Dragon's Tooth.  This is a spectacular monolith on Cove Mountain.  There were several young couples up there.  Perhaps it is a local graduation or post prom tradition?  It was also one of the most challenging climbs we have had.  We had to put away our trekking poles and use hand holds.  In a couple of places there were rebar steps. Papa Dale climbed to the top of the rock.  This was not for me.  The climb left us exhausted and the hike down was challenging.  The young people flew past us in their tennis shoes!  We didn’t care we had walked 14 miles before we even got to Dragon's Tooth.","Niday Shelter

We hiked up the road and tried to hitch hike up to the Catawba Grocery which is really a convenience mart.  We had breakfast and picked up enough supplies to get to Daleville, VA  and moved on.  The hike was fairly routine but we have been pushing hard lately so our tanks were somewhat empty.  We reached a parking lot in Catawba where day hikers park to climb to McAfee’s Knob. McAfee’s Knob is a rock overhang that offers some of the best views in VA.   It is iconic on the trail and is one of the most photographed spots on the entire AT.  There were a lot of people there.    We found some jigs of water left by trail angels so we refilled our supplies.  We stopped under a large rock formation for lunch.  We have not had good cell service for several days so we each spent our time catching up with our families.  As we made our way to McAfee’s Knob we ran into a lot of day hikers.  Soon we ran into Cherokee Rose and friends.  They gave us oranges and Twinkies.  (More trail magic.)  We learned that they also left the water in the parking lot.  As we made our way up the mountain we heard thunder rumbling.  Just as we arrived at McAfees’s Knob a brief but heavy storm hit.  There were two couples taking pictures.  They scattered and we tried to take quick pictures.  We returned to the trail hoping to make seven more miles and put on our rain gear.  We ducked under a big rock formation and checked to make sure the pictures were good.  No luck, the skies were too dark.  We agreed to backtrack and try again.  This time our luck was better.  We had to change our strategy and make camp earlier to dry out our gear.  So we pulled into a tent site at Campbell Shelter.  Once again the thunder rumbled.  I set up my tent, just as the rain hit.  Later we made dinner and exchanged pictures that we took of each other.  The third time was the charm.  The sky opened up again.  But we were safe and warm.  Tomorrow will be a longer hike since we changed strategy, but I’m sure glad to be safe and dry in my tent tonight.","Stealth Site

Random thought of the day. How did the pioneers survive in the mountains?  At home I can look out my back window and see deer, squirrels, birds and other random wildlife almost any day. In over two months, I have seen deer only twice on the trail and no bears (although lots of signs.) So it was a pleasant surprise when I saw two deer in camp this morning. Funny thing though...after hiking into Daleville, I saw about 20 deer on the hillside as I ate dinner.  
Back to the trail. We needed to make it into town before dinner because our food bags were nearly empty.  We really enjoy it when we run out of food just before we reach town because it means we carried just the right amount.  Not too much but just enough.  We try to carry no more weight than necessary.

We heard that there is a campground near the road crossing that would pick you up for free if you bought lunch with them.

The AT covers over 525 miles in Virginia.  This is far more than for any other state.  The excitement of starting our thru hikes is behind us and the tree canopy is in full glory so the lines of site are restricted.  These factors create a mindset known as the ""Virginia blues.""  I think the blues are starting to become more prevalent along the trail.  We need to stay diligent on keeping the work/fun equilibrium in balance.  This is especially true since we have rain in the forecast for the next seven days.","Stealth Camp Near Bobblets Gap Shelter

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591373,"Well as soon as we settled in to go to sleep, I looked up and saw a mouse about two feet from my head!  I grabbed my trusty Thermorest ZSeat and thwack!  He went flying out of the shelter.  That ZSeat is truly one of the most useful items in my pack.  A day hiker was trying to sleep in a hammock out in the rain.  About an hour later he came running into the shelter for cover and woke me up; so much for a good nights sleep.  My first night in the shelter went kind of like I expected. 
In the morning it started raining again about ten minutes after we left the shelter.  We went past several look outs but the clouds and fog were too thick to bother stopping. We stopped at a nice sight for lunch but again no view but at least I got a call through to my wife.  I always miss talking to her. Since I was delayed talking to my wife on the phone, I arrived at the road crossing where several white water canoe and kayakers were gathered a little behind my group.  Swimmer and Papa Dale were enjoying some trail magic of a beer with kayakers but the kayakers did not offer me one.  After loosing cell service with my wife, getting rained on for three straight days and missing out on the trail magic I felt pretty dejected.  I had internet service for a few minutes so I opened an email from a friend at home.  He is fellow long distance hiking enthusiast, Tom B.  I hope he doesn’t mind me quoting him.  He said, “When you arrive at Rockfish Gap, some 850+ miles from Springer Mountain, you will have made 25 punishing ascents and descents of 2000 feet or more.  You will hike another 720+ miles before you make your NEXT ascent/descent of 2000’ at Mt. Greylock in western Massachusetts!  So, take heart!  Find your cadence every day and let your mind wander wherever it will.  No worries!  The miles will melt away.""  His message was a very uplifting message at just the right time.  This trip can certainly be more of a mental challenge than a physical one at times.  I made it to a shelter around four in the afternoon, after two knee deep water crossings.  They were fun and semi-dangerous and at the same time, certainly cold.  The creek is raging away about 40 yards away.  It would normally be peaceful but tonight it is pretty loud.  We’re in another shelter with three young men from Baltimore who are out for a weekend hike.  They are nice young guys.  We will need to wade across the creek again tomorrow before we even put on our hiking shoes.  The creek is very close to the shelter.  This is another new experience.","Seely-Woodworth Shelter

I started my morning commute by wading through a knee deep stream to get back on the trail. We hit a rock scramble with water flowing down it where I dubbed the backup of of group the ""morning traffic jam.""  The trail was much steeper and harder than we have experienced in awhile. I like the technical areas. The are hard, challenging and fun all at the same time. It took us nearly three hours to go the first four miles.  I took a photo of a turtle I saw on the trail.  I joked that he was moving faster than I was.  I took my second fall on the slippery rocks.  That certainly diminished my enthusiasm for a long day of hiking.  We reached Reeds Gap and hitched a ride from a really cool young couple with their young kids.  They were heading out for a day hike.  (Thanks again for the ride.)  We arrived at Devils Backbone Brewry and Papa Dale and I decided to stay the night.  They allow free camping for thru hikers.  In addition to fantastic beer, they offer a really good hiker breakfast for $5.  This was a much needed break for me.  We need to be in Waynesboro, Virginia in two days and we are only 19 miles out.  Taking an unplanned day off like this is very uncharacteristic for me.  Maybe the trail is changing me a little after all.","Harper's Creek Shelter

Talked to the founder, Steve, he is a hiker and outdoor enthusiast.  He is also an Eagle Scout.  I have met a lot of Eagle Scouts on the trail.  Devils Backbone Brewery gave us all a  hat and shuttled us back to the trail.  We hiked about six miles and came out onto the Blue Ridge Parkway.  A gentleman named Greg was cooking hotdogs and had soda, snack bars, oranges, etc.  It’s been awhile since we have seen this kind of trail magic.  I met three nice young guys from Ohio.  They were all Eagle Scouts too.  We  made it to the shelter and started to ""cook"" dinner when a small group came into the camp.  They were employees of Devils Backbone who were out doing volunteer work on the trail.  They liked the fact that several of us were still wearing our hats.  I enjoyed a nice chat with them.  Tomorrow we we will nero in Waynesboro.  My wife is sending me new shoes and a summer weight down quilt.  With all the trail magic, a lighter sleeping bag and new shoes my spirits are certainly being lifted.

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592125,"I was able to talk to my wife twice today.  That makes it a pretty good day.  
When I was about 12 years old my Boy Scout Troop went hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains on the AT.  Being from Indiana, I was used to flat farmlands and not the mountain terrain.  As I hiked along the trail I felt at peace in the woods.  I loved walking along the mountain streams.  When we reached a Wayside some of the scouts I was with were talking to a backpacker who said he was going from Georgia to Maine with nothing but the pack on his back.  I thought, who would be crazy enough to do that?  Can it really be done?  Well as it turns out it is pretty popular these days thanks to some well known books and movies.  And yes, it can be done.  It takes a little gear and a little effort and a lot of sacrifice and support from home (for us married guys).  
We got a ride back to the trail from a local trail angel named Yellow Truck.  A colorful guy who, you guessed it, drove a yellow truck.  We entered the Shenandoah National Park and signed our permits and my life long dream felt a little closer.  We only hiked 10 miles today which was a little disappointing after the previous two short days.  But we were going slower than usual because Papa Dale's girlfriend has joined us for a while.  As much as people try it is almost impossible to train enough to keep up with a thu hiker.  She brought the first three days of food with her.  It’s a significant upgrade from what we are used to and it is a welcome change.","Rock Fish Gap

There are a lot of road crossings in the Shenandoah National Park, so there are a lot of opportunities for trail magic. Purple Haze was the first to emerge from the woods into one of the parking lots. I as I popped out of the woods I  yelled, ""Bring on the trail magic.""  Just a few seconds later two young ladies pulled up and jumped out of their car and gave us some wonderful trail magic. They had soft drinks, chips, fruit, and other nice treats.  They were hikers named Snapples and Laura from MI. They had to cut their trip short because Snapples pack didn’t fit her well and was hurting her.  Snapple and Laura - Thanks again for the kindness.
 We hiked until about lunchtime where we  made another road crossing.  Snap Chat from the 2017 class was there giving out the same type of fantastic goodies.  Thanks Snap Chat. 
Later we came across a day hiker who told us he had left more trail magic at the next crossing.  It was a trifecta for trail magic!  The holiday weekend was bringing out the best in people.  
We stealth camped just past ??? Hut. There was a large rock cliff there so we enjoyed a relaxing dinner while we took in the view.  A day hiker named Gene was there.  He walked over toward the edge.  I told him if he gave me his camera I could get a good picture for him.  It turned out well so we all took a turn.  Mine is the photo of the day.","Stealth Camp

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592368,"We broke camp at the usual time today.  It started out as a nice day so I lagged behind the group so I could walk alone for awhile and enjoy the scenery.  The group was making good time so it took me quiet a while to catch up to them.  I really enjoyed the walk and the tranquility of the forest.  However, in Shenandoah you are never really too far from the Skyline Parkway so you frequently hear the cars down below.  We stopped at Lewis Mountain Campground for lunch and walked a bit further and then......the rains returned and the thunder rumbled above the tree tops.  We had decided to put in a long day so we could reach Big Mountain Campsite some 20 miles away.  The Shenandoah’s are much closer to civilization than we have become accustomed.  Now it is much more common to be in campgrounds where supplies are available. 
It rained all afternoon and evening which motivated me to look up in the trees for the widow makers.  I don’t want my luck to run out.  A few days ago I had stopped to fill up my water bottles along the trail in the rain.  Papa Dale arrived just as I was departing.  He also refilled his water supply.  When he arrived at camp later in the day, he informed me that he had looked up to say something to me, I had just moved up the trail when a large branch dropped right where I had been standing.   That was a close call!  The next day as Papa Dale and I were hiking we heard a loud crack, and the sound of wood snapping.  A large tree fell in the woods right behind us.  Now I am certainly more aware to look up for the hidden dangers above.","Stealth Camp

We have all learned to count the timing between lightning and thunder to estimate how far the lightning is from you.  The rule is one second for each mile of distance away from your location.  The lightning was immediately above me.  Fortunately, I had just arrived at a park pavilion and was able to get under shelter relatively quickly.  I anxiously awaited the arrival of my trail friends.  They made it but were soaked and cold.  A family that was picnicking there built a fire in the shelter and allowed my friends to use it to warm up.  As soon as the rain let up a little, we made a break for the next shelter which was some 2 1/2 miles away.  When we arrived there was room for four; so put up my tent outside so the two couples could use the shelter.  The people in the shelter were anxious when I arrived because there was a large male bear just down the trail who would not leave.  This was our second bear sighting of the day.  The first one was a mother and two yearlings that were just below the trail as we left Big Meadows this morning.  We also saw several deer.   Shenandoah has proven to be by far the best place to see wildlife.  
We popped out of the woods long enough to have lunch at Skyland Resort.  About a mile down the trail I heard a distinctive rattle.  I knew immediately what it was.  I stopped and looked around until I spotted the rattlesnake.  It was about 2 feet from the trail next to a rock.  I saw several couples with small children coming up the trail.  They were clearly tourists, given the proximity to the parking lot.  I warned them to navigate around the snake.  I doubt that they would’ve even seen it if I wasn’t there to warn them.  It is amazing what some people see in the woods and others seemingly just walk past.

I enjoyed hearing his stories and his pace was brisk and challenging. I quickly fell into a nice rhythm and the miles flew by.  They flew by so much so that when I started to get hungry around noon I looked at the Guthook’s App (a commonly used guide of the trail that uses GPS) on my phone and I was two miles past the Wayside (a series of road side stores in SNP) where I planned to get lunch and pick up enough supplies to get to Front Royal, the next town on the trail. Oh no!  I had to backtrack 2 miles down the trail.  Worse yet, it had been mostly uphill and I was going to have to repeat the climb.  
At the Wayside several bears had tried to enter a the parking lot.  The rangers were sounding air horns to encourage the bears back into the forest.  I heard a ranger giving a talk on bears.  He stated that this area was mostly farm land before it became a national park and at that time there were less than 10 bears living here. The area was reforested and now the bears are abundant.  
After I corrected my earlier mistake, I was still one of the first to reach the Hut and I was able to set up my tent and eat dinner before it rained again.  I am warm and dry in my tent tonight but the tropical storm is coming through the area and there is a 90% chance of rain for the next 3 days.  It looks like I am going to get wet again.","Byrd's Nest # 3 Shelter

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594090,"Since my wife was in town we stayed in Gettysburg, PA.  We love the ambience of the town and the historical significance of Gettysburg.  Papa Dale had not been there before so we all decided to take a guided personal car tour of the battlefield.  We went to the visitor center and hired a guide who took us around the battlefield on a two hour tour.   He explained the total flow of the three day battle and the ramifications of the decisions many of the generals made.  My wife and I have taken this tour a number of times but each time we find it fascinating and learn something new every time.  The battle that was fought here was the turning point of the Civil War.  It's astounding  the significance this small community and the battle had on our country.  
After the tour Papa Dale and I returned to the trail for an afternoon of hiking.  We resumed our hike at Pinegrove Furnace State Park and made a short hike to the Green Mountain General Store.  We only walked 8.1 miles but it seemed much farther.  I guess I was impatient to see my wife again.  In the evening we enjoyed a nice dinner and a few laughs with Papa Dale.  It was a good day.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

They require you to hide your pack in the bushes behind the building and have even denied service to some hikers who were showered and presentable.  After lunch we hit the trail again.  The trail was fairly flat and went through a lot more farmland.  As I understand it some of the farmland is managed by the ATC.  We exited the trail at Route 11 and went out for another enjoyable dinner with my wife.  We had a great visit.","Green Mountain Store

It started to rain pretty hard just before lunch so we ducked into Darlington Shelter to eat.  We thought about staying there for the day but we started to get chilled so we had some coffee and pushed on to the next Shelter.  The rain let up a little until after we arrived at Cove Mountain Shelter and got camp set up.  It was welcome break from the rain.  We are short of our original goal of reaching Duncannon but given the conditions we had a pretty good day on the trail.  The only bad part was that my wife had to go home.  Our visit was awesome.,"US Route 11, Carlisile, PA

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594215,"Cove Mountain Shelter is famous for being visited by porcupines but we didn’t see any.  Perhaps they don’t like the rain either.  It was only my fourth time staying in a shelter but it poured rain all night so I was glad to be in a dry shelter.  I got there early enough to get a side bunk so I had plenty of space.  We had a short five mile hike into Duncannon where we hoped to get a second breakfast and see the famous hiker hotel, Doyle.  Nothing was open on Monday and even the Doyle Hotel didn’t open until 11.  So we walked about 3/4 mile to the Mitzabaugh Grocery Store and bought supplies.  Several local retirees were there in the coffee area.  We had a nice chat with them and one of them gave us a ride back to the trail.  We have been yo-yoing with Wheat and Cannonball the past several days.  We met them several times again throughout the day and had lunch with them at a shelter.  We all wanted to go farther today but settled for a shelter 15 miles down the trail because none of us could find our rhythm today.  The next shelter is 18 miles further and the tent sites were too far or didn’t have easy access to water.  At this shelter the water was 300 rock steps down a steep hill.  I must say that capped a tough day on the knees.  There are six of us at the shelter tonight. Three of us are from Indiana including Cannonball and a 77 year old working on his fourth thru hike.  Now that is what I call tenacity.  
It’s only 7:10 pm and only two of us are still up.  I guess that’s some indication of the day we experienced.  We are all warm, safe and even dry tonight.  I am thankful.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594303,"Well so much for a peaceful night in the shelter.  At 8:00 pm everyone was asleep.  Shortly thereafter a group of young hikers came in and everyone got woken up.  There was a fair amount of snoring which is part of shelter life and one of the reasons I rarely go into shelters and why most thru hikers carry ear plugs.  They are well worth the small weight penalty.  Today people started packing up as early as 4:00 am to get ready for a long hike to the next closest shelter some 19 miles away.  I know some of the young hikers thought the early start was payback but it wasn’t because I heard the early risers planning to leave at that time the night before.  Papa Dale and I got up and left at out normal time.  After a 19 mile hike we arrived at Rausch Gap Shelter.  As we expected there was a large crowd and so we wanted to move further down the trail.  Later while hiking, we met a local guy named Troy, who was out walking his huskies.  He offered to walk with us to the trailhead and give us a ride to town.  Hmmm.  We weren’t planning to go to town but a crowded shelter and the high probability of storms made it an easy decision for us.  As they say, ""The trail provides.""  The longer I am out here the more comfortable I get with that axiom. I appreciate the support on my guest book. I normally don’t respond because it isn’t possible from my cell phone but I do appreciate the support.  But I want to give a couple of quick shout outs. 
Shawn - It was great hiking with you. You definitely have my vote for the strongest section hiker we have encountered. TJ - Good to hear from you. I wanted to take this hike since I was a youngster but one of the things the kept my desire burning was when I read Sylvia’s copy of ""A Walk in the Woods"" on the houseboat. Your note reminded me of that.  Tom B - Still working on the beard!  Today we dropped into triple digits remaining.  That’s right only 996 miles to go!","Peters Mountain Shelter

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594304,"Ring Ring, Ring Ring.  I was hoping it would be storming out so I could sleep in a while.  No such luck, but it did rain overnight so the hotel was still a good idea.  We could see rain on the mountaintop where we would begin our hike. So back out into the elements we would go.  But first we had to find a way back to the trail head.  Several people asked us about being thru hikers at breakfast so I thought one of them might offer to give us a ride, not this time.  It looked like we would be hitch hiking again.  But first PaPa Dale wanted to buy some snacks at the Speedway.  While he was inside, I Yogied a ride from a local. That’s right on the trail when we need something, we are like Yogi Bear. (We beg politely to get something while trying not to get caught by the Ranger) Ok, well some of you are old enough to remember.   
The trail was unremarkable as far as sightseeing was concerned because it was fogged in and raining.  This stretch of trail is less challenging because there is less change in elevation.  And in general there is less to see.  But there are lots of rock scrambles which can be fun.  But today I was cautious because rain + rocks = slippery rocks.  So we methodically made our way to the 501 Shelter by mid-afternoon and decided to stay.  More storms were predicted. It was a shorter day than we hoped for but it was nice to get inside.  501 is one of the few enclosed shelters and is close to a road, so you guessed it we ordered pizza for dinner.  The rain didn’t arrive yet but it certainly is good to have the wet shoes off.  Tomorrow we were planning to go to a hostel that provides transportation to the Yuengling Brewery but we have elected to go the 24 miles into Hamberg because they have a Cabelas and PaPa Dale needs new shoes.","PA Route 443

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594507,"Well it’s time for us to have that conversation that makes us all uncomfortable.  At some point you know it needs to be said; no, not that conversion.  It's the one about the Pennsylvania rocks.  For some reason Pennsylvania was endowed with more than its fair share of rocks.  It starts when you cross into Pennsylvania but doesn’t get really bad until you reach the 501 Shelter.  That’s where we stayed last night.  Pennsylvania has lived up to its reputation.  The rocks are sharp and beat up your feet.  I enjoy the boulder scrambles where you get to choose your path and make your way across the rock fields.  However, the small sharp rocks beat up your feet, knees and ankles.  That’s the reason hikers call Pennsylvania, ""Rocksylvania.""  We originally hoped to make it 24 miles into town but decided to stealth camp about four miles outside of town and hike in for an early breakfast.  Other than the rocks, the trail was uneventful today.  The weather was pleasant.  I will say that the trail maintenance has been spectacular so far and it is done entirely by the volunteers of the 14 trail clubs along the A T.  So it’s hard to complain, but today’s stretch was more overgrown and had lots of deadfall trees across the trail that had been there for quite a long time.  Hopefully, it’s just this short stretch.

As you will recall from an earlier post, town is just a four letter word for full pack and a steep climb back up to the mountain top and my knees were still angry from the morning.  Two short hikes in one day did not feel very restful to me.  I really wanted a day off.  Despite the mental challenges of the day, the camp was peaceful and no hikers passed by.  The Mountain House dinner was good and the mosquitoes that are swarming outside the netting of my tent can’t get to me.  All in all it was another great day on the trail and I am looking forward to a good day of hiking tomorrow.","Stealth Site 1214.9

Their food was way better than what we had in our food bags.  Trail magic!  As former scouts, Papa Dale and I enjoyed telling them about our hike.  Thanks to Troop 72 from Fogelsville, PA for the awesome dinner.  We made sure to let our hiker friends who passed by the campground know what they missed.","Stealth Site 1223.5

Yes, it felt more like rock climbing than hiking so I put away my poles and enjoyed the adventure.  The scenery was spectacular, so much so that we decided to have a snack on top.  For me it was definitely the highlight of the day.  Later we maneuvered through another good rock climb.  We pasted Baked Oven Knob which offered a beautiful panoramic view of the mountain range ahead of us.  A young man was on his knee proposing to his girlfriend as we walked past.  When we arrived at the shelter area where we had planned to camp we realized we were only two miles away from Palmerton, so off we went for a warm dinner and a hot shower.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

They covered the marshy floor for nearly 6/10 of a mile.  After completing the boardwalk, we stopped at a local barn that sold fresh produce, flowers and food.  We decided to have a second breakfast there.  From there we went up and down several large steep climbs which eventually brought us to the mountain tops and provided us with wonderful views.  The one named ""Stairway To Heaven"" is especially notable.  There was another one that was so steep we had to use rebar ladders to make our way up the mountain.  This is the first time since Dragon's Tooth in Virginia that we were climbing on rebar.  The water sources were rather murky and even after we filtered the water it provided a gray looking water.  We chose not to drink it and so I started to feel a bit dehydrated as we progressed on down the trail.  After about 20 miles we exited in Bellevue at the Belleview Farm and Creamy Whip.  Thankfully, we were able to refill our water bottles and eat some wonderful ice cream.  Two large thunderstorms rolled through while we were there so we waited them out and avoided getting wet again.  Then we proceeding up the mountain in search of a stealth spot to camp.  We quickly found a nice spot to camp but we wanted to make it farther up the trail to the next shelter in order to stage up for the next day, so we moved on.  It turned out to be a big mistake.  We had to go over two very large rock formations at the top of Virginia Mountain.  It was still very slippery from the earlier rain and dark was upon us.  I fell once and No Filter fell a couple of times.

Once in Great Barrington, our first stop was to the South Barrington Civic Center because you can buy a day pass there for $5 and swim or better yet take a shower.  It was a holiday so the Center was closed.  I asked them to pull into a hotel and went inside and asked if we could pay to take a shower.  They gave us a room for $30.  We also did laundry.  Then off to lunch, resupply at the grocery and then No Filter ran into the local Outfitter which is really more of a furniture store but he was able to buy new shoes.  The thermometer at the bank said 95 as we headed back to the trail to add six more miles to our daily total.  It was over a thousand foot climb.  With the heat it was a hard six - seven miles.  When we arrived at camp we had to go .25 miles down a very steep incline to get water.  And then we had to climb back up to camp, of course.  I had a great time with my daughter and her fiancé so my 4th of July exceeded expectations.  She even did some trail magic by driving Pacer into town to his hostel and giving him a Gatorade.","Glen Brook Shelter

My hiker hunger was raging wildly when and we still had a mile to go to the designated lunch spot.  When we popped out of the woods onto a road and saw a sign advertising refreshments, it was a no brainer.  I have seen this particular spot on You Tube and read about it on other Journals.  It works totally on the honor system.  They offer soft drinks and a good variety of snacks and farm fresh eggs. Eventually we reached Upper Goose Pond Cabin which is the most decadent shelters on the trail.  They have a cabin with bunk beds complete with mattresses similar to what you get in most hostels.  It features a beautiful pond you can swim in and the volunteer caretakers make you blueberry pancakes for breakfast.  The bunks were all taken when Irish and I arrived so we are tenting with Batman and his dog, Robin, in the woods behind the cabin.  Naturally that means it’s going to rain but that’s ok at least it will cool down. Speaking of the heat, No Filter has been suffering from it the most.  His brother came to visit so he will be off the trail for a day or two.  I need to post on because I want to summit before a special family event in mid August.  I wish No Filter happy trails and hopefully we can reunite in time to climb Mount Katahdin.","Tom Leonard Shelter

 We made good miles despite the rain.  The temperatures were much more comfortable.  We stopped at a shelter around 11:00 am for a snack.  We heard that Spot had friends down at the road hosting trail magic.  We asked how far we would have to walk.  When we heard that it was only two miles to the road there was no question.  We were on our way there.  Eureka!  We made it!  They had sandwich’s, drinks and lots of snack food.  Thanks to Spot's friends for the trail magic.  We then made our way into Dalton, Massachusetts.  We tried to get a room at the only hotel in town but it was sold out.  So we walked over to Tom Lervardi's.  Tom is an icon on the trail.  He has been letting people camp in his backyard free of charge for 39 years.  He only asks that you are quite for the neighbors and respectful.  He give shuttles around town too.  We walked to the town recreation center for showers.  If my friends could only see me now.  We went to a local microbrewery for dinner.  They had live entertainment.  I always enjoy live music.  What a great end to the day.","Upper Goose Pond Shelter

If we fall short we have to find a way to make up the shortfall.  So today our shelter options were 17 or 23 miles away and involved two steep climbs of approximately 2000 feet or more.  So naturally we chose the 23 mile option but first we needed to stop in a small town 1/2 mile off the trail to top off our food bags.  We have been staying as light as possible especially until we become accustomed to the big climbs again.  Also I developed an infection on my big toe from walking in wet socks all day a few days ago.  I needed to decide if I would seek medical attention while in town or walk another 60 miles to Manchester to the next large town.  I elected to self treat the wound and keep moving down the trail.  It took much longer in town than expected so the 23 mile option was off the table.  This was probably a good thing since my toe was pounding with each step.  We soon reached the Vermont state line and stopped with Ironman and another gentleman for pictures.  He asked how my hike was going and I mentioned my concern about my toe.  He asked a few questions and I quickly realized he had some experience and so I asked him to take a look.  Turns out that he was a doctor.  He confirmed that I had done the right treatment.  It made me feel better that a trained professional examined it in person.  We pressed on but I moved slowly to lessen the impact on my toe.  We passed the 1600 mile mark, another good milestone.

One very large home even had a sign out saying thru-hikers were welcome to use their pool.  In town businesses offered everything from a free donut to a slice of pizza.  I really wanted a shower and laundry but all the usual facilities were closed because it was Sunday.  I was sitting outside the grocery co-op and a lady leaving the store said we looked cleaner than most thru-hikers and when I laughed and explained that the showers and laundry were closed she said we could come over to her house to clean up.

Yesterday as we left Hanover it was a short but very steep climb. In that it’s the first time we have encountered a rope to assist us. The fun continued this morning as we made our way over the north and south peaks of Moose Mountain.  After summiting Moose Mountain we experienced more of the heavily wooded forest.  While it is nice you really don’t get any exceptional views.  It was very hot again and it has been dry for a long time.  Many of the smaller brooms are dried up now.  That means water sources are few and far between. Hikers are spreading the word around on where you can find water.  Today we had two water arrows of eight miles each.  At two pounds per liter that makes the hike much tougher.  At the first water stop we had lunch with some SOBO’s.  We see about ten a day now. We ask a lot of questions about the White Mountains.  Interesting enough they don’t ask us nearly as many questions.  After lunch we took on our toughest challenge in some time. We climbed Smart Mountain. The climb started at around 900 feet and went to over 3200 feet and stretched for four miles. The last mile was the steepest climb in over 1700 Miles.  We were aided by rebar steps at one point. We stealth camped along another Brook and several of the younger hikers were swimming while we had dinner.  Tomorrow is another long climb and it is supposed to rain all day.  A couple people went four extra miles to avoid going over the rock ledges in the rain.  I would have if I thought I could.  The heat combined with the long climbs were enough for one day.,"Mink Brook

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599382,"I went downstairs at Ruthies Hotel and had some coffee with the owners husband, Kevin, while I waited on the hardware store to open.  I walked across the street to Brooks Brothers.  No not the clothier, here it is the local hardware store.  One of the guys was a backpacker and he was very helpful in helping me MacGyver a fix for my pack frame.  We fabricated a threaded rod and covered the threads with electrical tape to keep them from cutting the fabric.  Then we ran down to the local bakery for a fantastic breakfast and to catch our ride to Caratunk.  Joe and Kathy own the bakery and he is a very experienced hiker.  He gave us a ride even though it was a sizable distance.  He wouldn’t accept any money for the ride.  So we gave him a donation for the local food bank because I read a sign when we were in the bakery stating that they raised money for the charity.  
After Ed dropped us off we crossed the Kennebec River by canoe.  That is officially part of the AT and it even has a white blaze painted inside the canoe.  From there we had a short six mile hike to camp.  After we set up our tents we walked to the nearby pond and cooked dinner on the dock while we soaked our feet in the cold water.  It was a wonderful evening. The entire day was a blessing and it was largely due to the fine people in Bethel that were so kind to us.","Kennebec River Crossing

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599383,I’m getting trail fever.  In the morning I really want to get going so I can put some miles behind me.  By around 3 pm I start to get tired but I’m not willing to quit until I make my daily mileage target.  Today we started with a 1.5 mile climb.  It looked hard on the profile but in comparison to the mountains we have been traversing it wasn’t bad.  The scenery from the top made it all worth while.  We stopped at a Brook for lunch. My feet are getting pretty sore so I soaked them for a while.  It was very refreshing and helped me get through the afternoon.  We had a similar climb to the earlier one just after lunch.  Again it was not too bad. After that the terrain mellowed out somewhat.  But we still only managed to travel 19 miles before calling it a day.  I haven’t had phone service for two days and I really miss talking to my wife.  The scenery here is spectacular and I really wish I could share it with her. We are camped next to the river with Duke.  I saw him a lot in the Smokies but just ran into him again.  I hardly recognized him as he has lost over 100 lbs.  It was nice to catch up with him.  The river is relaxing.  I will sleep well tonight.,"Pleasent Pond Lean-to

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599389,"Today’s objective was to reach Monson for our last resupply for the trip to Mt Katahdin.  We were only 11 miles away so I hoped we would be there by noon for lunch.  We arrived at the road and a section hiker offered us a ride to town.  We checked in at Shaw’s Hostel and it lived up to its reputation as one of the nicest on the trail.  The owners Poet and Hippie Chick are thru-hikers and seem to really enjoy their business.  Poet helped me switch the middle bar on my pack with the belt bar that I made.  It helped the feel and ride so I feel better prepared to head into the 100 mile wilderness tomorrow.  We did the normal town chores and arranged for a food drop in the 100 mile wilderness so we would not have to carry seven days of food.  We went to the local pub for lunch.  It was good but took a long time.  So we didn’t really want to go back for dinner but everything else was closed. Irish stuck his head in the door it was closed but the trail provides.  The owners invited us in and made us a custom dinner complete with crembrlea for desert topped with fresh picked blueberries.  It was an awesome experience and something you would never expect in a town this small. 
At the Hostel I met the Crawford family.  They have gained notarity on the trail because they are a family of eight hiking the trail. The youngest is only two years old I believe.  I learned that they are from the same hometown as I am.","W Branch Piscatacuis River

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599391,"I have waited an awfully long time for today when I first heard of the Appalachian Trail one of the things that fascinated me most was the 100 mile wilderness. A stretch of American's most beautiful land in an untouched state. Well except for the logging they used to do here.  I knew I had finally arrived when I saw the sign that warns you not to enter unless you have at least 10 days of supplies. It didn’t disappoint.  The hiking varied between challenging and easy. We saw beavers  building a dam, waterfalls and several overlooks that revealed the mountains ahead.  We forded several brooks and rivers which were a blast.  Irish is an expert kayaker and he is trying to teach me how to read the currents and find the safest passages.  I find it fascinating.  We stayed at Shaw’s Hostel last night and we left fueled for the day with a large breakfast of eggs, bacon potatoes and a final course of all you can eat pancakes with fresh blueberries.  It really helped me enjoy the hike.  Today’s irony was that I am in the most remote place I have ever been and I got chemical burns around my waist from laundry detergent that didn’t get properly rinsed out.  Yes, chemical irratation where there are no chemicals and more importantly I don’t have anything to treat it with.  I have seen this happen to two other hikers and they were told to use benedryl but I won’t have access to any for 5-6 more days.  A hiker in front of us saw a moose but accidentally scared it away trying to alert us.  Too bad, it would really cap off my trip to see one.  For now  I am content to be camped by a beautiful waterfall.  The Crawford’s just came by night hiking.  I invited them to camp with us but they decided to hike to the next brook before stopping.","ME Route 15

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599392,I had a really pleasant day again.  Some great views and nice terrain although challenging. Stopped at an Overlook on the recommendation of Poet at Shaw’s Hostel.  I think it was the best of the entire trip.  We sat there for a while and took it in.  Awesome.  We had lunch at one of the four summits and I made some coffee.  It sure made the afternoon go better.  We met a trail angel at Shaw’s Hostel.  He is helping the Crawford’s through the 100 mile wilderness.  He put on a great dinner of chicken primavera.  Not something you would expect to find on the trail.  The Crawford’s came in shortly after we ate.  It’s amazing how far those young kids can hike in a day.,"Wilbur Brook

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599393,"It started to rain as we pitched our tents last night.  It was just getting dark outside.  It rained fairly hard all night.  I didn’t get much sleep until early in the morning.  So we skipped the trail magic breakfast that Fresh Ground was putting on while we slept in until 7:30 hoping the rain would end. (No such luck.)  We had a wide river to ford right away and the water was swift due to the rain. From there we puddle jumped and waded through water the rest of the day while it rained off and on.  It was tough going.  The first 10 miles were all uphill with four long steep climbs.  We finally summited White Cap Mountain around 3:00 pm in the pouring rain.  On a sunny day you can see Katahdin from here but visibility was minimal today.  We worked our way down the backside of the mountain and made camp in the rain again.  We knew Fresh Ground was doing more trail magic 2 miles further down the hill but we didn’t want to risk not finding a camp site.  I was fairly miserable; soaking wet, with chemical burns from laundry soap around my waist where my pack belt rides and chafing from the rain.  Not to mention I am fighting a sore throat.  Irish could tell I was suffering and made me stop to eat and refuel.  It really helped.  That was the most I have struggled since the trip began. Now I am warm and somewhat dry.","West Branch Pleasant River

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599524,We packed up with our gear totally wet again but at least it wasn’t raining.  We had to make 15 miles by 3:00 pm in order to meet our food resupply drop off.  The morning had one climb but it wasn’t too bad.  We summited just before noon and had lunch on the beach at Crawford Lake.  The Crawford family arrived for a swim just as we were departing.  It was an easy trail all afternoon.  I really needed that as my foot was sore.  We arrived just in time to meet the food drop.  After that we dried out our gear and lounged by the river.  Fresh Ground made spaghetti for his trail magic dinner.  I saw several thru-hikers that I have not seen since Virginia.  Everyone is talking about when they are going to summit Katahdin.  I am eager to finish.  We plan to arrive at Baxter Park on Wednesday evening and summit of Friday.  My wife is going to meet us there. I am very excited on both accounts.,"Logan Brook Lean-To

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599693,"The rush to Katahdin is on.  We started the day nearly 60 miles away.  Several of the hikers went out early to make it to Baxter State Park on time to summit on Wednesday or Thursday.  We are taking a more moderate approach but want to be in position to summit by Thursday or Friday.  I strongly prefer Friday because my wife will be there then and after all her sacrifice in making this dream a reality, I really want to share the summit day with her.  Only the threat of severe weather on Friday could alter my plans. 
On the trail today the conditions were still fairly forgiving but the rocks and roots continue to pop up. We passed several magnificent ponds that are completely undeveloped and in their natural state.  The loons were out and singing in their spectacular voices.  We planed to camp by a lake where we knew there was a stealth site but a girls camping group was already there. We went further down the shore and found another area that actually had two old picnic tables and room to camp.  Bingo!  Well not so fast, after a few minutes we noticed that the entire area was overrun with ants.  We had to move a half mile down the trail to the nearest lean-to which is what Maine calls to it’s shelters.  There was a set of bronzed baby shoes on one of the picnic tables.  I'm not sure what the story was behind those but it certainly made me curious.  As we left the beach the girls gave us their left over dinner so not all was lost but I was really looking forward to seeing the sunrise over the lake.  This time the ants won out.  But after all it, is their territory and we are just visitors.","Jo-Mary Campsite

Kingsman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600469,"Splat!  We had just walked out to a viewpoint to see Mt Katadin in the distance.  It was shrouded in clouds so we could barely see the profile in the distance.  As we returned to the trail, I came to a 15 foot rock face.  I knew to be careful but I rushed and went Splat!   My left side was the only side that wasn’t already scraped or burned.  Well at least I’m well rounded now.  We hiked to a lean-to for lunch.  I heard thunder so we took a nap in the shelter and waited out the storm.  That was a first for me on the trail.  I might just be a thru-hiker after all.  After the storm a nice group of people, including two individuals from Ireland arrived to our site.  Of course, Irish wanted to stay and talk awhile.  Who wouldn't want to chat with fellow countrymen when you are in a different country from your homeland.  We hiked a few more miles to a nice camp by a lake.  It had spring water and we thought it might rain again so we stopped for the day.  We were a few miles short or our goal but we still have two relatively easy days left. Some trail maintainers and a small group are here too.  They offered us leftover dinner again.  Yes, it was another great day on the trail.","

43 Years of Dreaming, 2 years of planning, 5 months and 2 days of execution and it was finally complete.  I had fulfilled my nearly lifelong aspersion of hiking the Appalachian Trail.  I thought I would feel elation but it was more of a surreal feeling of calmness. As we approached the summit I told Irish to touch the sign first because he was the strongest hiker and would have beaten me there if not for the fact that he was exercising teamwork to complete the trail. We started working together on June 28.  He declined and insisted that we touch it together.  Despite the strong winds and overcast skies, there were a lot of people on top. They started to congratulate us but it still wasn't registering with me what we had just accomplished.  We took the requisite pictures.  I took one holding a token that No Filter had given me for helping him along the trail while Irish took one holding a picture of a friend who recently passed as a memorial.  These were two important things for us.  We tucked in behind some rocks and ate some food before heading back down the Abol Trail.  There are many trail journals that have described the trails and they were spot on so I won’t attempt it here.  At the bottom Irish hitched a ride for us with a section hiker named Second Wind (who we had recently befriended) to the Ranger Station to reclaim the rest of our gear.  To make the climb easier, we had taken light packs up the mountain.  We started to drive toward the front gate to meet my wife since we got back down the mountain quicker than we had expected.  We passed her on the road and Second Wind signaled her to put over.  I eagerly hugged her.  The journey was now complete. I’ll fill in the gaps on my journal and perhaps offer so final thoughts and suggestions for future thru-hikers that have been following my journal but for now I will just spend a few days absorbing all that has transpired and focus on returning to my life at home. Thanks for following along.","The Birches Campsite
