You have to run across to the median! A half mile north is the visitors center for Harriman Park (water and potty!!). Two more mountains: West and Bear left.
On West I met ""Ghostrider"" a southbound veteran tells me the trail is about to smooth out. My unit 1/17 Air Calvary traded our horses for helicopters but we always remain Ghostriders!

The water at the shelter and most of the water on the ground is contaminated and even with treatment and a filter much of the metals still come through and leave you feeling nauseous.   As a result I've had to carry an exceptionally large amount of water. Both the Hudson river valley and the next valley to the east with the throughway are plagued with constant noise that carries clearly right up to the ridge in until you this send below the ridge on the other side you don't have the wilderness feeling!   Occasionally it feels so close that you feel like you're walking along the side of the interstate!   I suggest bringing earplugs for this section! Once I was able to to cross Highway 84 and the next ridge, the trail is absolutely beautiful and dead quiet.    The New York hiking club has done an exquisite job of maintaining in marking his whole section of the trail.   Although most of it's relatively flat there are still any of rocks to climb up and down! If you like parties there were invitations all along the trail for Labor Day celebrations! I arrived at the telephone pioneers shelter with no one here!

I couldn't see squat through my glasses in the wind, rain and fog and promptly slipped on the first descent, breaking my fall with my wrist.

Fortunately Blueray and I met Swampfox, another aging guitar picker with only about 100 miles left to finish the trail who brought his car. He graciously ferried us to the Farmhouse for the famous family style meal ...I honestly had  never consumed so much in one meal: 3 bowls of pulled pork, 3 servings of chicken, 3 servings of roast beef, mash potatoes, 2 servings of green beans and two blue berry cobblers a la mode! The storm struck as predicted knocking out bridges on the trail along with power at the hostel, which also takes out the water pump!  We again imposed upon Swampfox to slip Blueray and I down the road to Burger King for breakfast. We waited for the rain to abate then at 10 headed out on the trail for our main destination, McAfee Knob. The first bridge was washed out and much of the trail under water so most of us stripped to shorts or underwear and switched our boots for Crocs. FYI they do float! We waded through fields and forded streams and finally found our way to the Catawba base to McAfee and after 10 miles, the Knob.  The weather cleared for us and we arrived at this icon about 4:30 with Human, Halfpint, Dirty Harry, and Bottles. This was an easy hike for a change so after savouring the spectacular view along with a celebratory toast we decided to look for a place for the night. The park is under a camping restriction to camp only in designated camp sites plus another storm was coming and we wanted to try and make Troutville the next day. This meant 6.7 miles before dark so we hit it hard. At 5 miles we made it to Tinker Cliffs...and wow!!

The views of Roanoke and the Shenandoah valley made us pause for a long lunch before descending from our beloved trail into the noise of the city and for me, back home.. funny how much the trail now feels like home. Normally when having fun, time flies but after the brutal hard climbs it feels more like a year than 5 weeks! Yet, an awesome experience that will truly change you: it has me. I have now completed 880 miles, approximately 40% of the trail and need 215 more or about 3 weeks to the halfway point. Hopefully, we can return in Sept and spend a week or two in the Shenandoah Valley. Virginia has captured most hearts with the Grayson Highlands, Dragon's Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs.  Hot Springs seems to be the favorite trail town with Damascus a close second.  The White Mountains seem to have an edge over the Smokies but I suspect the time of year seen plays a big role. Max Patch and the incredible Hump Mountain are breath taking. Roan Mountain exposes more breathtaking mountains than any other in the South.

We climbed Crystal Mt from Dalton with nice ups and downs stopping at the Cobbles for great views of Greylock in the distance with Hoosic  River Valley and the town of Cheshire. The forest here is right out of Harry Potter with massive roots and rocks.  We descended into Cheshire to find the ice cream shop open. After a short walk across town we hit the trailhead to Greylock. Joe and Ron had left us a message on the trailhead board.  The climb begins with nice ups and a trail angel left some trail magic in the form of frozen Powerade drinks! We passed a couple SOBO from Lake Tahoe who were doing the trail for the third time! Towhee fell and broke her colllarbone and was back on the trail in two weeks! Her husband like myself fell and bruised/cracked a rib and spent a sleepless week on a level.  Seems we all need to really watch our steps!

We went to the Bascom Lodge: very neat and rustic with cozy fireplaces and period furnishings from early 20th century.  We started the long hike down to the van stopping briefly in Mt Williams for a break.  This turned out to be a very hard down, very hard and by the bottom both of us were beat! Lots of slippery roots rocks muddy bogs and knee busting steps. This puts me on the Vermont border for the next leg.  Massachusetts has been awesome: one of the prettiest sections with very hiker friendly towns.  They are also very neat and picturesque. The ponds, lakes, and cabins are Norman Rockwell. This was a great improvement over the Connecticut section and the trail facilities and markings first class.

I left Liberty Springs campsite at 7:30 and quickly climbed Little Haystack.  Ryan and Lofty passed me anxious to get to Crawford Notch and beat the forecast weather.  On this Franconia Ridge Mount Lincoln blocks the view of Lafayette and it's easy to think you are looking at Lafayette when it's actually Lincoln!  There are lots of trails besides the AT to these summits, and many easier to hike so there were lots of people.  On Lafayette you could see Washington and the coal fired cog train.  Looking West you can see all the way to Vermont and the mountains we climbed there.  I continued all day climbing Mt Garfield and ran into Earthheart.  We were both trying to stealth camp and avoid the AMC huts with their high fees.  If the weather turned I was going to stay at the Galehead Hut.  I was really getting stinky from the long climbs and took a quick dip in the icy stream by Galehead and pressed on.  They require non-refundable reservations and for thru hikers it is almost impossible to know your arrival date.  For a few if you arrive by four pm they offer WFS (work for stay) and you work cooking et cetera for the right to sleep in the dining area on the floor.  I really want to make sure I could meet Robin the next day before dark so I pushed on and climbed South Twin Mountain. It was a rough way to end the day: two hours to hike up .8 miles! and there is only one stealth campsite at the top that may be taken.  I was worried I would be stuck after dark.  I reached the summit at 7:30p in a strong wind and couldn't see any campsites!  The stealth site was behind a large boulder .1 miles down the north side of the mountain and thank goodness no one was there.  It was nicely sheltered with no wind.  I quickly put up the tent which used every square in of the spot as the sun set.  Just as it was getting dark a father and son were also trying to find the same site!  and had to continue down the mountain.  There was no phone signal and the next problem would be coordinating pickup with Robin.","Liberty Springs Campground

Bald Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599874,"I was worried about making it to meet Robin and worried about the weather.  Hard rain in the forecast and it was a lot of miles should the terrain be tough.  I left early after breakfast at 5a and struck the tent hitting the trail at 6a.  I was finally able to get a call through and thought I would have signal again but... nothing all the way to Crawford Notch... not even at the huts on the way!  I climbed the ridge to Guyot mountain thinking there would be signal... nope.  Great views and downhill all the way.  The Zealand Falls hut was about 8 miles from the notch and gorgeous but no signal..I made great time getting there.  It is right on the pond and popular because unknown to me, the AMC really made it accessible with a beautiful 7 mile path so... I made it to the notch way ahead of schedule! at 3 p. and again there is no phone signal!  I hitched a ride to try and get phone signal and was picked up by another hiker, Jennifer, a school teacher who is hiking all the 4k peaks in the northeast.  We drove toward North Conway until I got phone signal and was able to reach Robin.  She dropped me off in Bartlett where I met Robin.  We headed straight for the Green Granite Inn before the rain!  Took the next day to resupply and take a trip to Mount Washington.  My shoes are almost at their end and Robin brought new ones which we found out on Mount Washington have very slippery bottoms and cannot be used.  Apparently, Brooks changed the soles and they are very slick on the rocks here! We ran into Orange and Knots at the summit!  Great break and will pick up the trail on Thursday.","South Twin Mountain

It’s was a cold night and with the wind chill very cold! I climbed Mt Pierce/Clinton, Eisenhour, Franklin and Monroe then took a break at Lakes of the Clouds hut before climbing Mt Washington.  The wind kept blowing so hard on my pack it was hard to keep my balance on the rocky climb to Washington.

Weather is still holding out.  I left Summer Breeze and Sunshine on Mt Washington and wonder where they spent the night: we are supposed to meet at Pinkham Notch. I had a decent but very rocky hike up Mt Madison and to Madison Hut passing Rocky who at 70 looked in bad shape.  He couldn’t make it to any place before dark and slept on the rocky trail! He was frozen and out of water and his legs were cut up badly. I gave him water and moved on. After Madison the miles picked up but I still had no place for the night!  Robin had been trying all week to get me a room at Joe Dodge Lodge but they were full.  She continued to try every few hours while driving back to Raleigh but no joy. There are no decent campsites there. I hit the Notch and went straight to the lodge; still full but I sat there waiting for a cancellation  and Greg put me in an AMC volunteer room, Amen! While wait I met Hawkeye 72, who wanted to hike with me.  I told him I needed to be in Katahdin by Sept 15th and he said he would be there by the 12th! Said OK we leave at 8 in the morning and climb Wildcat. I went to the visitor center and picked up my bounce box we had dropped off. I was exhausted. I showered, ate, and hit the sack!

Our tramily artist, Picasso, could have easily made the road but insisted on smelling the roses. We  pitched the tents and enjoyed the ambiance then did a community dinner. Just as we were finishing dinner and hanging our bear bags a huge group of over a dozen Harvard students stomps in to camp! The “future leaders of our nation” obviously hadn’t checked the weather nor planned whatsoever on where they would tent nor, had they been schooled in the most basic rules of campground etiquette: they stomped all over between campsites waking all of us hikers and flashing their white and not red headlamps into everyone’s tents.  We couldn’t vacate the premises quickly enough the next morning before the rain came. Hikers are incredibly polite and considerate. You almost never hear a voice after 8p, only use red light if they have to get up at night and in the morning disappear silently like a vapor ... no talking.  I expect the totally unprepared students had a nice morning washout!","Bemis Mountain Campsite

It was a wonderful day and with the warmer dry air a very pleasant walk.  Going past East Carry Pond (they are called carry ponds because they used to carry people and supplies by boat across the ponds) where we originally had planned to tent the beach is naturally sandy and the water crystal clear.   At the shelter I met Violet, a 12 year old young lady with her mother and grandmother out for a hike. I went to the pond for water and to wash my legs and immediately noticed it was very warm, in the 80's! so unlike the extremely cold crisp waters we had been hiking through in the mountains.  So, I went swimming with Violet with enough time to totally dry out in the sun. Calamine (so named from sitting on poison ivy roots) also camping near the shelter took some great photos. A couple hours later Bear Snack showed up, again making decent time that was much better than we had anticipated. A short time later while cooking dinner we were joined by a delightful southbound couple flip floppers: Chumbawamba and Amazonian. He posts on instagram his sketches of the trail: Effelar and has a similar hearing issue as mine but reversed, hears from the right rather than left.

Bald Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603154,"This was an awesome quiet night.  Passed in the morning by Snow Angel while eating breakfast.  Climbed Columbus mountain, Fourth, Third and Chairback Mountains.  Met Gin Gin MATC on the trail who had through hiked I believe in 2017 and rushed through the wilderness.  She encouraged me to take the scenic side trails and specifically the Gulf Hagas after fording the West Branch of the Peasant River.  So I did after swimming in Chairback pond.  I was feeling hot and stinky and there is the most cool inviting swimming pool at the base of Screw Auger falls.  I climbed down swam and washed my clothes as the weather began to turn and it looked like a nice rain storm was heading my way.  I decided to keep my pack dry and joined Compass at the Carl Newhall Lean to.  Two other hikers joined us.  Chipmunks attacked my pack for a Snicker's wrapper.  They woke us up constantly and it was a lousy nights sleep!","MM 2095.7

Bald Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603157,"The cold front blew out the storm and temps dropped nicely after 11p the night before. It was a lousy nights sleep and I was anxious to be alone.  At 7:15a I climbed White Cap and found Gizmo and Bearcan.  I confirmed reservations at the White House.  Forecast for Monday was not looking good for a summit but I decided to stay on schedule and take the time off at the White House. On the back side of White I got the first clear shot of Katahdin.  It was a nice easy descent from White with stone stairs!  Descending with awesome views of the whole valley became emotional and tears began to flow.  I think it was finally sinking in that I could see the end!  It was cold so I stopped for lunch in the shelter of Logan Brook Lean to and put on everything I had.  When I crossed Logan Road someone had left a drop.  I had still 10 miles to my drop for tomorrow and Compass has the same drop but at 4p and mine was at 2p.  I wanted to be sure to make an early pickup at the White House.  I stopped for the night off trail at Mountain View Pond with one other hiker, SOLO from Memphis in a hammock.  This place was incredibly quiet and absolutely still.  I got up early to relieve myself and there was a moose in the pond at first light.  I was fast running out of food and anxious to make the pickup.  I rationed out the remaining Snickers and food bars accordingly.","Carl Newhall Lean to

I really hustled not wanting to miss it and made the drop by 11a!  Now I had three hours to kill.  Patriot, the best trail magic ever, was still there! with all sorts of cold drinks, food bars, chips, peanut butter sandwiches and so much more! including chairs!  I was able to plug my phone and backup battery into his truck and bring both to 100 percent which should give me five more days of battery!  I ate so much it hurt!  I texted Shaw's from White mountain to make it 2 PBRs, not one.  They did and Gary showed up at 1:45 with my drop and a cold beer.  I was too full and gave the second one to him.  Compass also showed and was able to get her drop early also. This was a super break!  I pressed on to Antler Campsite meeting Sarge and his daughter, Lighthouse who were camping with Real Nice, a civil rights lawyer doing the wilderness NOBO.  We were all headed to the White House the next day for a break.  Antler campsite actually has a privy, Fort Relief, with side by side seats!  The Maine Hiking club gets five stars!  They have marked the entire trail beautifully and have plenty of composting privies in some of the most remote locations!  This is the club to join and support no matter where you are from.  Jo Mary Lake is really a lake and this is an awesome campsite: one of the prettiest!","MM 2123.9

Some kind of sun shower!  We all hiked separately to Mahar Tote Road and the White House Landing pickup dock where you can call or text or, use a battery walkie at the dock to call for pickup.  There is great phone and LTE signal at the White House and on the pickup dock and almost nowhere else in the wilderness. Jo Mary Lake aka Pemadumcook? is fairly warm now and we could swim and wash clothes in it.  They have complementary canoes and are famous for their burgers and all you can eat breakfast.  The owners for the past 40 years, Bill and Linda run this camp year round.  You can come in by boat, seaplane, and snowmobile.  Bill picked us up in the outboard, Sarge, Lighthouse, Really Nice, Shaggy and Maggie and Cedric later.  Really nice is a civil rights attorney currently clerking for a Michigan Supreme court justice and is taking a couple months with her husband doing the last section.  We really got into a discussion on the spiritual side of the trail as she shared how she is feeling the need to reconnect with the Indian Sikhism of her family and of course I shared my Christian testimony and how my life has changed.   Afterwards I took the canoe out for some alone time then had a swim and a nice long nap before dinner.  The place is solar powered and uses propane for hot water and lights.  They have several cabins and a bunkhouse.  While getting to know each other, it turned out all the NOBOs of our group were from North Carolina! and, there are two more just ahead on the trail.  We all were planning to summit Katahdin Sunday or Monday but as the forecast for Monday was increasingly ominous, we decided to make a hard run the next day for Baxter with a Sunday Summit in three days.  Linda made a huge dinner with a garden salad of endless juicy tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dinner was topped with a huge Sundaes.","

I put on everything I had and without moving still was cold!  Weather report for Monday still was just not looking good calling for morning frost and rain after 3p.  Saturday report for Katahdin was high winds but sunny but Sunday looked perfect!  I decided to push for a Sunday summit.  It was a lot of miles and might be more than I could handle but I'll give it a try.  The others encouraged me.  Real Nice is not through hiking and wasn't going to join us.  We had the famous all you can eat breakfast...awesome!  Hiker hunger was the norm.  I ate 4 eggs, 8 bacon, 2 English muffins, 3 glasses O.J., 4 cups of coffee and 15 blueberry pancakes.  Half hour later I was hungry again!  Bill had our small group of five on the dock at 9am, which was generally a late start.  Our tramaly (trail family) was now Shaggie, Maggie, Huck, and Ray. (Asheville area and Wilkesboro) We began hearing rumors that many others were focusing on a Sunday summit so it will likely be a zoo and no one seemed to know if they would limit the number of hiking permits and no one has a reserved space in the park.  The trailhead and Birches campground is 10 miles into the park after the wilderness and we just soldiered on anyway.  We climbed Nesuntabunt Mountain and got a nice 16 mile view of Katahdin in the clear.  It was perfect hiking weather.  Trail was now just rocks and roots with little up and down to Rainbow Lake.  Here we caught up with Calves and Chaco from Cary and Pittsboro! and now we have a Carolina family of 7!  My feelings as with others are mixed.  When I left White Cap after seeing Katahdin 50 miles away I found myself crying with uncontrolled emotion.  Now I am feeling excited to climb Katahdin in cool clear weather! and, it looks like a monster crowd will converge on Sunday.  The extra hard miles actually gave me a small blister on one toe, just when I thought foot issues were history.  I otherwise feel fantastic; best I've felt in years.  To succeed we have to cover a lot tomorrow and I don't know how tough the terrain is.  There is one point we should have phone signal and then nothing until I'm on Katahdin!  Robin is on her way up and I have no idea when I will be where and when and, no way to communicate.  The others are in the same boat!  Plus, Flash from Greensboro is supposed to summit at the same time with his wife. Rainbow campsite actually has a piped spring next to the lake.  We watered up and to accommodate my slow pace, all agreed to be packed and on the trail by 6:30a the next morning!","White House Landing

Bald Eagle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603182,"Everyone was packed and ready to roll at 6:30a.  It was cold so moving is the name and I set as fast a pace as I felt comfortable.  We would have phone signal on Rainbow Ledges briefly so I wouldn't hold up the group I prepared a detailed text message for Robin and my support group of Jim, Julie, Nikki, Moondog, and Nailgun the night before that I could dispatch quickly.  When we got to Rainbow ledges we got signal and everyone tried to make contact.  Chaco's girlfriend was denied a permit into the park, it was sold out! and would try to meet outside the park.  Huck arranged to meet his mom and go to Millinocket.  I called Robin and spent a couple minutes on the phone, which turned out to be serendipity.  All got chilled standing in the wind and headed on leaving me to catch up later.  By the time I got to Abol bridge and the restaurant they were 30 minutes ahead and sitting down eating.  The Birches have 12 spots first come, first served for thru hikers and when I hit the restaurant was told there was one spot left! and that registration was .1 miles up the trail.  Since all were couples except me, I dropped my pack and double timed to the registration which happens to be a half mile up! and got the last spot at 11:55a and, it specifically says you agree you cannot sign in, leave the park and go back to the restaurant to eat with your friends! and if you try and are caught you will be thrown out of the park and no Katahdin!! I had already put my name down when I read this and, my pack was back at the restaurant.  I hustled back to get my pack, missed that meal I was really looking forward to and grabbed my pack.  The others said they will do the commercial campground and try to get a shuttle in the morning to meet up then.  They still have the ten miles to Birches to hike.  I grabbed some peanuts at the concession and my pack and zipped back to the park, apparently unnoticed and hiked the ten miles to the Katahdin Stream Campground ranger station for my hiker's permit and Birches registration.  It took all afternoon and I met two local fishermen, Doug and Churchill, who later helped me celebrate the summit on Sunday.  About halfway here comes my tramily SOBO slack packing! Really made me wish I stayed back at that restaurant!  I still had my paid for campsite, which at the moment I didn't need, for Sunday night at the Katahdin Stream Campground!  I hit the ranger station at 4:30p and waited for Nick, the ranger to show up at 5p with hopefully answers to all the scheduling questions.  He showed up at 4:45p and signed me up for the Birches and issued the Katahdin Hiking permit #709 ... yeah I'm in! and also registered my receipt for campsite #24 for the next day.  I watered up and zipped over to the Birches to find Compass and others I have been hiking with.  They shared a lean to spot with me.  It was very cold as the sun set and we had a nice fire to cook by.  I ate and shared a nice cool one then hit the sack as the fire went out and it got dark...about 7:30p.  It was hard to sleep with the end so close and the climb the next morning. At the registration the park had the latest weather report which looked fabulous for tomorrow except the knife edge trail down was closed for electrical activity!  Who knows why because the sky was almost cloudless!","Rainbow Lake Campsite

Apparently I didn't need to feel bad about the Birches.  The whole group paid $45 per person to camp at Abol and neither showered or got the all you can eat breakfast because they had to leave to shuttle up to KSC to summit by 7:30!  It was a very cold morning, about 36 degrees, with a frost advisory for the granite.  When I returned to KSC I walked up the trail to sign out Huck, Ray, and myself and walking back I met Doug and Churchill.  I was feeling bad I couldn't celebrate in Millinocket, but was also too tired to do much of anything and when they offered a couple nice Maine beers, bananas, strawberries, and brownie, I was very happy to stop!  I headed to the Ranger station to pickup my pack and get some nice water from the stream and met Yelp from England.  He with a small group couldn't get into Birches and had to get out of the park! 10 miles and dark in an hour!  My campsite that I bought is a six tent site so, I invited them to join me.  They comprised Yelp, Handstand, Luke and, eWolf.  Without asking they paid for the site and procured firewood! and we celebrated.  Handstand and Luke were getting married on Baxter the next day.  eWolf, a Michigan lawyer, is performing the ceremony and Yelp is the witness!  So, all turned out beautifully!","Birches

I put on everything I had and cooked up oatmeal and coffee.  Then, I climbed back in the sack to keep warm and read until almost ten, struck the tent and packed up to go to the sunny parking area to wait for my rescue team!  I enjoyed reflecting on the many lessons and blessings from this incredible experience.  This trail is a gift from God and, so is my wife Robin, her parents, and my children Julie and Nikki.  The support from family and friends has been priceless and generous.  The encouragement from my now close friends and hiking buddies, Moondog, Nailgun, and Blueray has been inspiring.  Robert McMillan, a sage attorney and friend, said simply, if you just put one foot in front of the other, you can hike the trail.  Sounds simple but I repeat that simple advice constantly!  It applies to everything in life.  Likewise, when your feet hurt, stop but when they stop hurting start back and don't stop until they hurt again!  I began this hike overweight and stressed when I didn't even realize it.  Baldeagle has changed.  God is everywhere and the trail teaches you that if, you are seeking him.  Baldeagle is just Baldeagle and now listens much better.  I am humbled by how much I never noticed: in the trees and the woods and, in life.  The constant grind of climbing up and down carrying a heavy load changes you.  In a sense it is like carrying a small cross.  I have been beaten to just about my limit.  Fallen down repeatedly and suffering a sprained wrist, cracked ribs, knocked teeth loose, lost toenails, and countless blisters. I have suffered a hematoma that but for God's grace would have been if not fatal, totally debilitating.  There has been times the weather has literally sucked the will to live completely out of me.  By the end of this hike I finally have found a balance.  I am fit and healthier than I have been in decades.  The interaction with others in these circumstances is priceless.  Bad company corrupts good, conversely good company encourages.  The AT attracts really nice people from all over the world and from all walks of life who selflessly encourage one another.  The accomplishments of volunteers on this trail is something to behold.  No government organization has ever done a trail this well!  These selfless ""angels"" are helping hikers in the toughest places and asking nothing in return except for you to enjoy your hike.  I use to remember my life as a third before Vietnam, a third in Vietnam, and the rest since.  Memories pop back as fresh as yesterday complete with sights, smells and sounds.  Now, some that refused to leave have left and peace remains. Now, I think of my life in four parts.  It is my hope that this resource can help other veterans and without their waiting forty or fifty years.  It is my hope they find the light and love that God holds for each and every one of us.  Baldeagle","Katahdin Stream Campsite #24
