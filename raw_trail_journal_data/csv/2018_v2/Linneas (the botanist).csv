Linneas (the botanist),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585583,"We wanted to go to Low Gap Shelter but it’s 5 miles from here and we were afraid we wouldn’t get a campsite when we got there so we hiked 1.2 miles down a hill to Whitley Shelter.  Only a couple section hikers are here camping, too.  We sent the night last night at the Walasi-Yi Hostel.  No laundry!  Had to put on dirty clothes after shower.  About 15 in Hostel but no snoring!  Everyone was very quiet this morning.  Tough climb out of the gaps.  We’ve been hiking 8 miles a day. We’re not ready for more miles.  Section hikers said forest fires in area.","Mountains Crossings GA

Linneas (the botanist),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585845,"We saw a beautiful sunrise out of our tents, this morning.  About midday we climbed up Kelly Knob, straight up, no switchbacks.  Then down for abt 2.5 miles in an hour.  A nice guy gave us a lift into town.  Got our laundry done and ate pulled pork bbq.  Shopping tomorrow then back to trail.","Tray Mountain Shelter
