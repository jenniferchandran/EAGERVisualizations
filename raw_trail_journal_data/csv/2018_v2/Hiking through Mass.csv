Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603538,"It has been a year since Tonto and BrewHa hiked on the AT.  Friends, ControlC and Kentucky Bourbon, completed the Trail through Connecticut in June and asked if we wanted to tackle Mass in September.  Great idea, Tonto was really excited when she learned we would be staying in a B&B every night.
We left Blairsville Monday afternoon for Atlanta.  We arranged to spend the night at our daughters home before our Tuesday morning flight.  Control C and Kentucky Bourbon joined us shortly after we arrived and we enjoyed Mellow Mushroom pizza and wine.
The following morning, son in law Stephen drove us to the airport.  We enjoyed an airport breakfast before departing on a 10:30 flight to Albany by way of Baltimore.  The Southwest flight was on time and we arrived in Albany ready to tackle the trail.  We rented a Hyundai from Enterprise and off we drove for our B&B in Becket, Mass.
Stops in Pittsfield for wings and groceries precluded our arrival at Bancroft House in Becket.  The house is quite remote and gorgeous.  Built as an old farm house it contains three bedrooms and three full baths.  Numerous sitting areas, cable Tv, and best of all a huge well stocked kitchen.  After a thorough walk through it was time to crash.  Our AT adventure awaits us in the morning.
Note:  Kentucky Bourbon spent hours searching for the B&B that was geographically centered for the hike and had all amenities we would want.  She nailed it with Bancroft House.",,View Entry,"Sep 18, Tue",0
Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603542,"This 8 day hike was organized by Control C.  He is a master planner when it comes to researching weather conditions, altitude, distance, and logistics.  He arranged for a shuttle driver to meet us daily at our hike destination and then transport us to the trailhead.  Susan is a 1982 through hiker with extensive trail experience.  We will get to know her over the next several days.
We met Susan at Jug End Road at 8:00 AM.  This was a little earlier than we had wanted, but she tutors students and needs to be done early in order to meet her kids.  It took us nearly an hour to arrive at our Rt. 23 trailhead.  It was a partly cloudy day and the forecast was for temperatures in the mid 70s.  The trail was well maintained with several foot bridges and plank walks.  The first portion of the hike was through swampy lowlands and we were prime targets for mosquitoes.  We are talking big, cast-a-shadow, sized blood suckers.  Kentucky Bourbon found Burt’s Bee repellent at the B&B and applied a healthy amount in an attempt to ward off the blood suckers.  This act seemed to merely upset the flying leaches and they feasted on the four of us all morning.  
We crossed a road around 11:30 and decided to stop for lunch.  We spotted a sunny lawn just up the road and out of the low,wet mosquito haven.  We were just finishing when the home owner came out to greet us, we thought.  “What are you doing?  This is private property.”  We replied that we were seeking relief from mosquitoes to eat lunch.  He sternly ask us to leave.  We packed up and headed back to the woods having completed most of our lunch before sunshine gave us the boot.
The rest of the hike featured rolling terrain and bogs.  We ascended 1,732 feet and descended 1,578 feet over the 12.4 mile trek.  Our gray Hyundai was waiting right were we left it and climbed aboard heading for the grocery and beer store.  Tonto and BrewHa cooked up a batch of spaghetti, French Bread, and tossed salad for dinner.  A couple bottles of wine and we were ready to crash.  Tonto is really excited about a bed, shower and toilet rather than a tent, privy, and dehydrated meals.  What a Softy!","Jug End Road

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603543,"If you looked at a map you might think we are a little confused.  We backtracked today’s hike to a section preceding yesterday.  Control C organized this so we could take advantage of forecast weather and minimize elevation gain on our first day.  Having access to car shuttles will enable us to mix and match trail segments as we like.  So today, day 2, we will start at the beginning.
Control C and Kentucky Bourbon hiked Connecticut in June.  They ended at Bear Mountain, right on the border.  We picked up at that point to insure continuity of the trail.  Sages Ravine welcomes hikers to Massachusetts in grand style.  The ravine is a 2 mile stretch of beauty featuring a stream and gorgeous waterfalls.  The trail crosses the stream on a sketchy rock and log crossing.  Tonto never appreciates a challenging stream crossing, especially a fast flowing, thigh deep, cold water thriller.  None the less our crossing was successful and we proceeded on our merry way.  
The Trail ascended along rock outcroppings providing beautiful views to the valley below.  We climbed Mt. Race at about 2400 feet then descended over rock scrambles before pushing our way to Mt Everett near 2600 feet.  The rock scrambles were challenging and we progressed slowly along the rocky ridges.  We descended to Jug End Road at 1,000 feet and collapsed into the car.  We had ascended 2,149 feet and descended 3,261 feet over our 12.4 mile day.","Bear Mountain

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603548,"Day 3 is always a challenge for us.  The body begins to feel the effect of back to back days and puts up a fuss.  The trick is to push through and enjoy.  We began the day in light rain, back in swamp.  We were prepared with our newly acquired can of bug juice.  Fortunately, the mosquitoes were a minor inconvenience today and the rain ended mid day.  As we climbed out of the swamp we crossed a pasture with cows grazing.  The trail entered a wooded area and again we encountered bovine grazing.  Our new companions accompanied Tonto and BrewHa up the trail until they lost interest and let us by.
The hike featured a series of short steep climbs and some rock scrambles.  An area called the ledges featured rock outcroppings and picturesque views across valleys.  We passed by several ponds and lowland swamps. 
The hike was 11.6 miles long with 2100 feet of ascent and 2182 feet of descent.  On to day 4!","Route 23

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603556,"This will be our longest hike in Massachusetts.  We are hiking North to South taking advantage of the elevation profile.  As we traveled down a the gravel road to the trail junction, the driver ran over a large branch and it was temporarily lodged under the car.  We later learned the car had to be serviced for a rattle.  Bummer.  Ray caught heck from Susan I am sure but he seems to be a laid back guy and I am sure gave the incident little thought.
Our hike was fairly flat for the first 3 miles before we descended 700 feet to cross the Massachusetts turnpike.  We had roller coaster hills before climbing Baldy Mountain at mile 13.  The last mile and a half was a downhill knee blaster.  Along the way we passed by several ponds.  We stopped for lunch near Goose Pond cabin and nearly froze from a strong wind blowing in off the water.  After lunch we passed the site of a former exclusive lake club.  The members turned the property over to the AT many years ago.  All that remains is an old stone chimney in an overgrown field.
Tonto is experiencing foot pain after about 6 miles of hiking.  It is made worse by rocky downhill treks.  We carry a second pair of boots for her to change when the pain becomes too much.  This is the first day she changed on the trail.
Long day, but beautiful, cool, windy weather for a change.  We are to have rain later next week as the front moves through.
A word about our dinners.  Couples took turns cooking dinner the first two nights.  Tonto and BrewHa cooking spaghetti, French Bread, and salad our first night.  Control C and Kentucky Bourbon prepared Salmon, potatoes, and broccoli for day 2.  We dined out at Dream Away Friday evening (it was excellent).  This evening CC and Ky Bourbon went to mass and dined out while we stayed in and ate left over spaghetti.  Obviously we are eating well.","County Rd

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603681,"Poor Tonto.  She went to bed feeling kind of punk and awoke with a major soar throat and cold.  She did not even attempt to get out of bed.  For today, we are three.
The hike today is exciting.  Although out of sequence, we hiked to the Vermont Boarder.  The hike started with a short downhill warmup before we climbed Mt Prospect and had a beautiful view out over the valley.  After several photos we headed downhill for over a mile into the town of North Adams.  Not much happening in town.  We were entertained by a young boy on his electric scooter. 
As we left town we crossed a river and ascended along a beautiful stream on our way to Vermont.  The climb intensified significantly as we overcame a boulder scramble then a short muddy climb into Vermont.  We had lunch along with a family of 3.  They spent the summer hiking New England states high points.  
We backtracked about a mile to the Pine Cobble Trail.  This 2 mile descent included a beautiful view from the the cobbles over the valley below.
Upon returning home, we were greeted by a wheezing and sneezing Tonto.  She had found Clorox towelettes and cleaned the place in an effort to reduce contamination.  Her nursing background at work.  We prepared a gourmet meal of grilled Bratwursts, Red Cabbage, Saurkraut, and Corn on the cob.  Another fine meal on the AT.","Notch Rd

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603680,"We have been looking forward to the climb up Mt Greylock since we agreed to hike Massachusetts.  Today was the day.  The drive to the mountain was encouraging as the sky was partly sunny.  By the time we got to the trailhead it was apparent we would not see much at the peak.
We climbed steadily from the onset and at times it was quite steep over the first 3 miles.  The weather was damp and cold.  By the time we reached the peak, it was windy, cold and extremely cloudy.  In fact we were not able to see the war memorial even though we walked within 75 feet of the base.  We watched an emergency response team training with sleds and baskets.  They were dressed for winter and we were wearing shorts.  The four of us proceeded to the Greylock’s Bascom Lodge for warmth and a cup of coffee.  Even though we had delicious PBJ sandwiches packed, we all opted for a fine hamburger from the restaurant and a bowl of chowder.  The server was quite friendly and we enjoyed our time eating and heating up our core.  Finally we ordered cookies and prepared for our exit back into the cloud bank.
The remainder of our hike was downhill.  Now you might think a descent would be a good thing, and normally it is a easier trek.  However, this was a knee, and foot buster.  In addition, three of us had extreme indigestion from the ranger burger we ate.  By the time we arrived at our vehicle our dogs were barking and the knees were squeaking and bellies were upset.  All in all it was a tough hike and unfortunately we had little to no visibility.
Upon returning to the castle, we endulged in Chile that had slow cooked all day, corn bread.  Some of us made a super nachos with extra onion and lettuce.  After our Ranger Burger distress after lunch we had concern about the chili.  However, the delicious meal did nothing to further upset stomachs, thank goodness.","Church Wells Rd

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603674,"The weather forecast was basically 100% rain all day.  For once, it was pretty true to forecast.  The steady rain accumulated to a little over 2 inches.  Not a day to be out in the woods.
The four of us did chores most of the morning before heading out for lunch.  As we hopped in the car, Control C cranked the engine and got basically nothing.  The gardener was here and he agreed to jump the car.  We got it started and drove to a spot where we had telephone reception.  We call Ed Enterprise Rental and, after some haggling, agreed to deliver a different car to us.  A couple hours later our Dodge MiniVan arrived.  We piled into the vehicle and ran some errands.  We ended up at Barrington Brewery where we enjoyed cold beer and a wonderful dinner.  We split a piece of chocolate cake 4 ways.  It was rich and contained two cans of beer in the recipe.  
We returned to our warm, luxurious house and proceeded to bed shortly after arrival.","None

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603672,"Second day off in a row due to forecasted rain.  Day was actually partly cloudy until thunderstorms hit around 8:00 PM.
We had a terrific breakfast at Ozzie’s in Hensdale.  Super good food and service.  We toured Lenex for a short time and then drove to Greylock hoping to see views.  It was cloudy, but much better than when we hiked up the Mountain.  Views were sketchy at best.
Returned to our plush abode and ate leftovers for dinner.  Storm hit, the WiFi went out and we crashed before 9:00.","None

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603668,"Wow, two “down days” should leave one energized and ready to tear up the trail.  Normally that may be the true, however when each of the rest days dump 2 inches of rain on a flat section of trail an energy-sapping mud slosh is created that sucks any recovery from our bodies.  The first 5+ miles we spent hopping from stone to root to rock to muck.  A slow trudge through the forest.  Tonto scraped her leg on a branch and everyone had wet feet.  Good times.
Two miles into our day we stopped by the October Mountain Shelter.  It was located right off the trail, otherwise we would have passed it by.  Two gentlemen were enjoying a cup of coffee before continuing their SOBO to Springer.  We struck up a conversation with Boat Strap while the second person, Sharp Shins was putting together his pack in the shelter.  We exchanged trail names.  When I told him we were BrewHa and Tonto the second person appeared and said he may know us.  Sure enough we had met him on our AT adventure in Virginia last year at Bear Den Hostel.  Last year he was not hiking but had stopped by he hostel as part of his planning for a SOBO for this year.  What are thodds that we would run into him this year at October Mountain Shelter.  Trail magic at it’s best.  It was great to see him and we hope to meet him at Springer Mountain when he finishes.  Highlight of our day!
The second half of our day was somewhat better than the first.  We actually had some passable trail intermixed with the bog.  Not exactly a walk in the park, but we did get a break from constant swamp walking.
Tonto is dealing with a cold and soar feet.  Rocks, and steep descents cause severe aching on the bottom of her feet just behind her toes.  We are carrying a second pair of boots for her to change into when the going gets rough.  This gives her only temporary relief.  A trip to the Podiatrist is certainly in her future.  
On the way home we picked up steak, potatoes and salad fixings.  Oh, and of course a couple bottles of vino to wash it all down.  Oh the life of a section hiker!","County Road

Hiking through Mass,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603922,"Seems odd to finish a State without hiking to the border.  We were able to scramble the sections to best suit weather conditions.  As a result, we did Mt Greylock and the trek up to a Vermont earlier in the trip hoping for sunny days on the Mountain.  Best laid plans, I guess.  Anyway, we finish Massachusetts today with a nifty 10.8 mile roller coaster day south of the state line.  
We started later than usual, 10:00 to dodge early morning showers.  We used this delay to stop for breakfast at our favorite diner, Ozzie’s.  We enjoyed coffee, and wonderful breakfast platters as the rain pounded the windows.  Finally it was time to hit the trail, weather be damned.  By the time we arrived at the trail head it was a light, misty rain.  
The hike had a little of everything.  We enjoyed mud, steep climbs, beautiful views from “The Cobbles”, and (unfortunately for Tonto) long, rocky, toe-busting descents.  We climbed 1358 feet and dropped 2021.  The rain was a non factor as the trail was already wet from Tuesday and Wednesday’s downpours.  The clouds kept temperatures at bay.  In fact, a light jacket felt good at lunch.
We had hoped for some Fall color by the end of our trip.  We did witness some golds and reds beginning to show especially in the higher elevation.  Another week or 10 days and the hills will be beautiful.
We returned from our final trek, got showers, and drove to a great little restaurant called Chester’s Open Table.  The food was good, but the musical entertainment was fantastic.  A one-man folk singer who was very talented.  We returned to the house by 9:00 to pack up our belongings.  The van leaves at 7:00 sharp for Albany and our return flight to Atlanta.","Grange Hall Rd
