'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587607,"Started at Springer Mountain at approximately 2pm on Monday, April 16th.  It was between 20 and 30 degrees with 25-30 mph winds.  I took a few pictures you can see in my photo library.  Intimidating start.  As we descended, the temperature began to rise, yet still had to sleep in 20 degree temperatures and 30 mph winds.  I woke up to frozen water bottles and felt too cold to even move.  However, since then the weather has been beautiful.  Started averaging around 8.5 miles a day until Thursday.  I stayed at Neels gap Hostel on Thursday night to avoid yet another blistering cold night.  Friday was my first long day with 19 miles!  The last 8 miles were relatively flat, making it possible.  I put in another 15.5 the next day.  Today (Sunday, April 22nd) I only put in 4 miles and am staying at a hostel in Hiawassee, Georgia to rest and to avoid 2 inches of rain today/tonight.  This is my first real rest day.  Nice to have a warm shower and bed to sleep in.  My next destination will be Franklin, North Carolina.  I will actually be finishing Georgia and entering North Carolina tomorrow!  Excited to be home and to mark off my first state.  Legs feel good and everything is going well.  I have met a few cool cats that I will be leaving on Thursday when I come off the trail for a wedding.  Oh yea..I have also acquired a trail name... 'Squatch...short for Sasquatch.  I will take it!
Favorite moments so far: the owl (see pictures)
I will update once I get to Franklin on either Wednesday or Thursday.  I love you all.","Springer Mountain

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587969,"I left the hostel with a few others at around 8 am on the morning of Monday, April 23rd.  This was by far the most difficult day of the trip I have yet to experience.  We received over 2 inches of rain, 45 degree temperatures, and relentless wind reaching gusts of 45 mph.  It was definitely a day that could break some, as I heard of multiple people quitting throughout the day.  However, on this day I reached NC!  I tried to take a picture of the GA/NC border sign, yet the weather was not allowing it to happen, so I had to roll past without getting a snapshot.  Once past the sign, we were greeted with one of the most difficult climbs of the trip so far, as well.  We ended up logging 16 miles, only stopping for a moment once all day.  If you stopped for too long or too many times, the cold and wet would set in and you didn't want to move any farther.  I stayed in a shelter that night with some familiar faces, and some new.  One of which was a 75 year old man on his second tour of the AT.  It was a very cold and damp night.  My clothes from the hike were more wet in the morning than they were the day before, making putting them back on very tough.  The next day, Tuesday, April 24th, we experienced just as much rain, yet without the cold and wind.  I knew that I was getting off in Franklin, and the next shelter was 7 miles from that goal.  So instead of staying another night in that mess, I decided to press on and push myself in order to get to Franklin.  I ended up logging 24 miles that day, for a total of 40 miles over the course of the 23rd and 24th.  It was definitely too much, yet I knew that I would be coming off for a few days for a wedding and had plenty of time to recover.  However difficult the weather made these past few days, I will say that the last 15 miles of that section have been my favorite so far.  I scaled cliffs, walked through streams, and was constantly witness to water barreling down off the mountain.  The sections with a little risk definitely add to the sense of adventure.  Cold, wet, and a little miserable, yet beautiful nonetheless.  After the wedding, I will be continuing my journey Monday, April 30th, with a few long time buddies.  They will be joining me from Franklin until Fontana Dam.I see this first 110 miles as a tremendous learning experience, revealing to me what to expect, how it all works, and with a much better understanding of my own abilities and limits.  I am thankful for the people I have met and the experiences so far, as together they have helped increase my confidence in continuing this journey.  I am excited to continue on Monday.","Top of Mountain Hostel Georgia

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589038,"Ray, Dev, and I started at Winding Stair Gap near Franklin, NC around noon on Monday, April 30th.  I was very excited and honored to have some familiar faces on the trail with me for the next 55 miles.  We cut our first destination a little short once we reached Wayah Bald the first night.  The observation tower had the most incredible views so we decided to actually sleep in the observation tower that night.  After the daily visitors left, we set up camp.  We were able to watch the sunset over the Great Smoky Mountain National Park behind us, while Franklin began to light up in the valley below to the East.  After the sun had set, the moon started to rise in the East.  It was a full moon, and as it approached the horizon, it was blood red.  The moon was so bright it actually made it difficult to sleep.  We also got to see an airplane land on a runway near Franklin during the night.  It was an interesting perspective to be above an airplane as it flew by and landed.  By far the most beautiful night so far.  The sunrise in the morning was just as amazing.  I tried to take some pictures, but pictures of these things never do them justice.  The next day we started our 3000 ft ascent towards the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  We set up camp about a mile south of the NOC with plans to hike in that evening to grab dinner and a beer.  Yet we were so wore out we decided to wait until the morning to make our way into the NOC.  That night, some sort of plane (very large), flew so low in the valley we all agreed that we thought for sure the next thing we would hear was a crash.  We didn't hear a crash, yet after it flew over we heard several coyotes close by howling back at the plane.  The next morning, we packed up and headed to the NOC for a nice breakfast before we started our 3000 ft climb back up to the ridges.  This made for a total of 9 miles before we started to find flat ground again.  We ran into some individuals who had said that climb was the first experience on the trail that made them want to quit.  We came into a camp that night that was found to be full so we pressed on for a few more miles and found a pretty sweet spot on top of the next ridge.  We were definitely the fortunate ones as we had our privacy and got to witness yet another sunset/sunrise duo from about 3800 ft.  Regrettably, the next day was the last with my friends.  We started our day with a portion called Jacob's Ladder, a section of the trail that climbs 800 ft over 0.8 miles.  This is one of the steepest sections I have come across so far.  The rest of the day wasn't so bad and we were able to take our time and enjoy our last day together.  We approached the lake at around 7:30, finishing with another 2000 ft ascent over around 5.5 miles.  
It was truly an awesome experience to take on these daily challenges with a great group of people while drinking from small waterfalls, communing with other hikers, and witnessing some of the views/experiences of a lifetime.  I am extremely grateful and fortunate to have had my friends along for this portion.  They hopped on the trail to experience some of the roughest terrain yet, and probably some of the roughest of the entire trail (minus the Whites).  Ray and Dev returned home and I am taking a zero today.  I will be returning to the trail tomorrow morning at Lake Fontana to begin the Smokies.  Ray and Dev hope to join me again near the TN/VA border.  Would absolutely love to have them along.","Winding Stair Gap (Franklin)

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589649,"The Smokies...what an experience.  Denise brought me back to Fontana and I started the trail around noon after enjoying the dam for a bit.  As soon as I entered the Smokies, I passed several signs relaying campsites that have been shut down due to aggressive bear activity, and of others under caution due to non-aggressive bear activity.  This sort of limited the places one would want to stay, making some of the shelters a little crowded.  This is also problematic as the park has slightly different regulations than the rest of the AT.  The park demands you stay in their shelter's unless they are packed full.  They have individuals roaming the park making sure you are doing that very thing, which is kind of paradoxical to the whole AT experience.  The first shelter I approached was in fact packed full so I gladly volunteered to pitch my tent.  However, had I known we were going to get more than half an inch of rain and lightning storms that night, I may have slept in the shelter.  The majority of the next day was dominated by fog and moisture, clearing up around 1:30, just in time to reveal how different the forest had turned around 5500 feet.  The rest of the trip was blessed with perfect weather, starry nights, and cool 6000 ft temperatures.  This section through well past Clingman's Dome has moved its way up to my favorite so far.  I had never been in a forest that looked quite like this area.  It was completely dominated by VERY large pines of all kinds (Frasers, Spruces, Hemlocks, etc) and neon moss that covered everything it could.  It looked as though someone painted the entire forest with a thick coat of green and just now it began to drip and chip away, revealing what had been covered.  
In this section I also had my first bear encounter.  Just about 10 yards off the footpath, a bear cub about the size of a rugby ball popped up and over a downed pine.  It stopped, sat up, and turned its head to look right at me.  It was absolutely adorable.  About 10 more yards down the hill from the cub I saw its mother.  Although the mother did not seem bothered by my presence, I did not stick around quite long enough to change her mind (hence why I have no pictures of this event).  I am thankful that my encounter was much more friendly than those being heard of on the trail.  It was probably one of my favorite experiences in the Smokies.  I had expected to see one eventually as I had passed several piles of steaming bear scat throughout each day.  I actually saw another one once picked up from the Pigeon River sitting on top of a small tree.  This was a little larger than the cub, but not quite full grown.  
Although the Smokies were majestic and borderline mystical, I was a little anxious to be on my way.  Between the Ridge Runners (those making sure were behaved while on the trail) closely monitoring, battling the mice in the shelters, and the constant expectance of bear encounters, I was able to push myself to complete the Smokies in 3.5 days.  However, none of these pressures took away my deep appreciation of the mesmerizing beauty of this place, as well as the experiences I encountered along the way.  I will be taking a few days off in Cullowhee, as I am helping with the SoCon Track and Field Championships.  I will be returning to the trail this weekend!  Next stop, Hot Springs!
Other events worth noting:
I was rattled at by a rattle snake on top of one of the ridges, yet did not attempt to find it, just kept on moving.  
I heard coyotes yet again in between the bouts of rain on the first night.
I climbed out of the shelter to use the bathroom in the middle of the second night and in the middle of it I turned to see two eyes glowing at my from about 15 yards away.  Half asleep, I panicked thinking it could be a bear and turned on my head lamp.  It was a large beautiful doe munching on some undergrowth.  Again, seemed unbothered by my presence so we enjoyed each others company for a few.
Descending 4500 ft through the park on the last day, you can literally see the biome almost suddenly change when hitting certain elevations.  This is evident by the changes in plant and undergrowth.Came across plane crash debris on the last day.  Unfortunately my phone was dead and I couldn't get a picture of it.","Fontana Dam

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590974,"I hit the trail Sunday, May 13th around 10:30 am to find the tail much hotter and more humid than I had left it.  On this day I passed over the famous Max Patch, as seen in the movie rendition of A Walk In The Woods.  The view was an incredible 360 degree view, yet even more incredible was the coincidence that took place at the top.  I ran into several hikers I had been hiking with weeks prior, thinking they were too far ahead of me to see again.  We split and agreed we would see each other in Hot Springs the next day.  I made it to Hot Springs on my own the next day around 2 pm, heading straight to the river to clean up and cool down before heading to the local tavern for a meal.  I had every intention of getting in more miles that day when I ran into my hiker buddies camped out on the river.  I decided to stick around and do the same.  That night, a family renting a house near by invited all of us over for free dinner, beer, and a fire.  Turned out to be a great evening of success stories and mutual grievances.  During this time, a couple whom we all knew came into town after having completed their first 20 mile day.  They jokingly collapsed (but also not jokingly) as we cheered them in.  It was in this moment I realized the necessity of the idea of a strong 'trail family'.  Truth is, this is not easy. This is not a vacation.  It's a pilgrimage.  Even if the terrain and miles are tolerable for some, the elements have a way of taking its toll on the mind and spirit, as was evident the next four days which were packed full of relentless torrential downpours, soaked clothes, and uneasy footings.  There is something very difficult about putting on wet and cold clothes each morning after trying to sleep through thunderstorms in a damp sleeping system expecting to get in 15-20 miles day after day.  Your feet are so saturated that after a few days your skin literally starts to peel off.  Those in the muck with you make success that much more attainable.  On my way out of Hot Springs before the weather set in, I had my 3rd bear encounter.  I was hiking on my own and I heard a crash so loud I knew it had to be a bear.  As I approached I saw the bear, larger in stature than the others, 15 yards off trail.  It held its head high, moved its ears around like little satellites, then took off.I also have had some more interesting owl visitations.  One night I was camping alone on a ridge when I was awoken by a loud noise right outside my tent.  It was 2:30 in the morning.  I climbed out to investigate to find a fog and darkness so dense I was afraid to leave my tent out of fear of not being able to find it again.  I looked up and perched in the tree right above my tent was a large owl calling to another within the same camp site, yet I could not see it for the fog.  The owl turned and stared at me with large dark eyes until I climbed back in my tent.  The next night I heard more, not so close, as I camped with others.  They asked what that noise was.  I explained a barred owl and they must be everywhere as I see and hear them all the time.  They told me that was the first they had heard the entire trip. I start the trail again in the morning as I prepare my mind for 3 more days of forecasted rain and thunderstorms.  The Tibetan people believe that they travel great distances to purify their soul.  The longer and more difficult the journey, the deeper the purification.  For this I look forward to and am thankful for these coming challenges.","Pigeon River, Tennessee

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592318,"Erwin, Tennessee to Grayson Highlands, VA has been a section packed full of experiences, milestones and adventure.  Throughout this section I have passed the 400 and 500 mile markers, I have completed North Carolina and Tennessee, have had even more bear encounters, and have continued the battle with the rain.  My first two days after Erwin were long, difficult, and wet.  On the second day, I marched extra hard to try to get to a shelter to get out of the rain only to find a shelter packed full with hikers who had the same idea.  I decided to continue to march on. After about an hour, the rain lifted and I stumbled upon a beautiful field with its own water source.  I decided to settle in this spot.  That evening I was witness to a double rainbow right in camp (see pictures) and a night sky so clear that I could see the Milky Way.  Then, first thing the next morning I had yet another bear encounter, making this the 5th bear I have seen.  I was hiking by myself, which is the case 95% of the time, early the next morning and heard something to my left.  I turned to see a bear about 30 yards from me sprint down hill in my direction and skirt up a tree.  It was wild to see the strength and athleticism displayed by this bear.  It then hung in the tree about 15 ft up and we had about a 5 to 8 second stand off staring at one another.  The bear then slid down the tree and took off back up the hill.  I think it was equally as nervous of my presence as I was of the bear's.  It was definitely a really cool experience.  These back to back monumental moments stand out to me as they occurred after a couple of difficult rainy days.  It stands testament as to how quickly things can change out on the trail.  Things can change in a matter of minutes, whether for an improvement or an unexpected challenge (which were stumbled upon as I will describe in a bit).  After leaving North Carolina, I entered the final 72 miles of uninterrupted Tennessee trail.  This section was beautiful, as it included several waterfalls, creeks, canyons, and grassy fields.  The landscape constantly reminded me of the Skynyrd line 'Have you ever seen the beauty of the hills of Carolina, or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee..?'  Because of all the rain, the waterfalls were nice and full, making them even more of a spectacle.  However, I also discovered that due to the rain, Lake Watauga was the fullest I have ever seen it to be.  It was overflowing its banks and innundated about a quarter of a mile in 3.5 feet of water.   Even though this part of the trail was temporarily closed, I braved it anyway and embraced the challenge.  A very interesting unexpected challenge generated by days and days of excessive rain.The next day I put in my longest day yet in order to make it to Damascus, VA (32 miles).  Making it to this town enabled me to make it home for a few days for a little recovery and gear repair (boots and mouse chewed jacket and food bag!)  I was also able to slack pack the Grayson Highlands section and avoid tropical storm Alberto.  Slack packing refers to taking a day pack with intention of exiting the trail after the hike, allowing the hiker to lighten their load.  I had some familiar faces join me for the hike, which is always uplifting, as well.  During our hike we were witness to the wild horses of Grayson Highlands and all of their newborns.  Truly a sight to see.  We also summited Mount Rogers, the highest peak in the entire state of Virginia.  I will be returning to the trail tomorrow to embrace more days of rain, yet a relatively flatter trek.  I will also be returning to the trail a few much needed pounds heavier than when I came off.  When I exited the trail in Damascus, I was down 15lbs, thinnest I have been in 11 years.  I am officially a quarter finished the entirety of the AT.  I am continuing my 500 miles through Virginia before I find myself half way finished on the other side.  I will continue to update as I can.  I love you all.","Erwin, Tennessee

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593141,"I have hit a fantastic groove.  I have been averaging 23 miles a day, been getting adequate calories, been fortunate to have been maintaining physical, mental, and spiritual health, and am starting to observe the transcendent power of the trail.  I left Grayson Highlands Wednesday, May 30th, to enter a foggy, wet environment with dreaded anticipation of more miserable weather.  However, the miserable weather never came, the clouds and fog lifted, and I have entered a beautiful state of thru hiking.  I have been greeted with trail magic ranging from much needed food to a much appreciated beer. The forest is also becoming much more lively as the weather lifts.  I have seen more and more wildlife, yet no more bears.  I have come across SEVERAL deer, many of which were unbothered by my passing.  Some of which maintained a position only 15 yards away.  Even closer were the wild ponies of the Grayson Highlands/Mount Rogers area (see pics).  I have been seeing around 2 to 3 snakes a day.  I have even seen a fox squirrel!   Probably the most exciting critter to have witnessed in this stretch.  The fox squirrel was so large that when I first stumbled upon it my initial thought was someone's pet lemur has escaped.  Virginia has been full of vast valley views, making the scenes from atop the ridges much more expansive and impressive.  
I had an experience the other day which has revealed, as I mentioned before, the transcendent power of the trail.  I made the mistake of not refilling my water for a 9 mile stretch of no available water sources, thinking I could make half a liter work.  A few miles in I knew I had made a mistake, as the terrain was steep and the temperatures were high.  I reached a view about 4.5 miles in where a few guys were hanging around talking about a new hiker outpost at the bottom of the mountain with a deli and such.  I was so relieved and excited I nearly sprinted off the mountain in anticipation of a burger and some fluids of any kind.  When I hobbled up to the outpost, I found it to be closed.  The disappointment absolutely crushed me (also teaching me to plan for the worst and only hope for the best).  I was a little worried about how I was going to make it to the next water source.  In that moment, two hikers approached asking if I was ok.  I explained the situation.  They then explained to me that they had just resupplied yet had to come off the trail for a few days and were lookin to get rid of their food and fluids.  They showered me in gifts.  I was ecstatic.  The next day I came across someone else who had a very similar experience, leading us to the phrase 'the trail provides'.  However, I feel comfortable enough expanding that to 'the universe provides'.  When you are on the trail, you are down to the very basics (water, food, warmth, dryness, etc) with very few outside distractions.  I believe that taking it to the basics makes such serendipitous moments much more evident as we now have the eyes to see them, yet they happen everywhere, all the time, everyday.  The other character with a similar experience explained that such experiences on the trail have revealed 'in spades' to him the life lessons his parents, teachers, or any other adult of influence had tried to teach him, while also restoring his faith in humanity.  He's excited to take these revelations with him back into the 'real world'.  I can agree.  
I have made my way into Pearisburg, Va for some food and R and R.  I will be returning to the trail soon and will be heading to Troutville!  Love you all.","Grayson Highlands

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594318,"I have logged plenty of miles since the last update, and I apologize for not having updated sooner.  I have not taken a day off the trail since May 29th (360 miles ago).  I made it into Waynesboro today after a 16 mile morning hike and plan on staying here the rest of the day, taking a zero (finally) tomorrow to recover, then hitting it again on Sunday.  I am beat.  Yet enlightened.Upon leaving Pearisburg, I had a very interesting and unexpected encounter.  As I approached the trail, I noticed a law enforcement vehicle sitting directly at the trail head.  When I got closer, the law enforcement officer climbed out of her vehicle and approached me inquiring as to where I was planning on going to/staying for the night.  She was very friendly, but it was still a little unsettling.  I told her I wasn't going far, as I had just left town and just wanted to do a nearo (a day with fewer miles than usual).  She told me I would pass an area of construction and they were looking to keep everyone safe, and that I would see the police tape marking the area to steer away from.  I walked on, only then beginning to question to myself why police tape would be needed at a construction site.  The next morning I got my answer.  I got to the area as I hiked along the top of the ridge and saw about 30 yards below the trail/ridge were massive tents I imagine were used by the construction workers, as we were miles from any civilization.  The workers were installing a 42"" natural gas pipeline right across the mountain, just yards from the trail.  The trail followed the construction site for about half a mile.  I started to question other hikers and locals about the situation, and was told that there have been lots of protests, people forcibly removed from trees of the surrounding areas, locals protesting on the bottom side of the ridge, etc due to the pipeline going through that area.  In some places, the pipeline was going as close as 50 feet to people's homes.  I then realized the law enforcement officer was feeling me out to make sure I was not going up there to cause any problems, as the AT is a great access point to the construction site.  All of this was VERY interesting.  Even more interesting is how localized the information of this situation has remained, which explains why I had no idea what I was walking into.  Wild stuff.Since that day, Virginia has decided to not be as flat as it had been before.  I have climbed multiple 2000-3000ft summits ranging from a distance of 3 to 6 miles.  Then of course what goes up must come down which is very difficult on the knees.  It has been brutal.  When my pictures are viewed, it is often forgotten the climb it must have took to get to those view points.  Although brutal, I have been witness to some awesome trail features.  Keffer's Oak is the second largest/oldest tree on the entire AT, estimated to be 350 years old (see pics).  The Dragon's Tooth Monolith, although an intense rock feature, contained the hardest mile and a half stretch I have come across yet, and it was going down the mountain!  The ascent was dominated by rock faces and sheer drops.  The same day I climbed McAfee's Knob, the most photographed feature of the AT (see pics).  After McAfee's Knob was Tinker Cliffs, a half mile stretch of the AT that is literally on the side of a cliff.  I also hiked along the Blue Ridge Parkway on and off for about 100 miles until the entrance was reached.  I stopped in Daleville, VA to resupply and get some calories at the end of last week.  It was a nice escape from the heat.  When I returned to the trail, within the first hour I was greeted with torrential downpours.  However, that evening, with the moisture in the atmosphere, I got some of the best views and nicest sunsets I have gotten thus far.  That night, I was on the BRP watching the sunset, and what turned out to be a very nice lady approached me and we started talking.  She then asked if I would want to come home and stay with her and her husband for the night.  So I did.  They cooked me dinner, washed my clothes, let me shower, gave me a bed to sleep in, and cooked me breakfast in the morning.  And her husband, to my excitement, had worked for NASA for 42 years, so I found it fascinating to talk with him/them.  After breakfast, they dropped me off where they had picked me up.  The nicest thing anyone has done for me on the trail so far.  I borderline got emotional when I hit the trail again thinking about how nice of a thing that ordeal was.  Not sure I have ever been treated so well by ''strangers'' before.  Two of the sweetest people I have met, and definitely my favorite trail angels.  Thank you Lynda and Larry.  I feel the greatest gift this trail is and will continue to give is the gift of appreciation, as I feel appreciation is a precursor to happiness.  Going down to nothing makes anything extra feel exceptionally special.And the owls continue!!  I was hiking one night and was losing day light.  I was several miles in (28) and was keeping my fingers crossed I would find a campsite soon as I was toast.  On my way to the location I was hoping to find a site I said to myself in my own mind that I had not heard an owl in a few days.  Literally like 2-3 minutes later a barred owl started its call ironically when I approached the area I was hoping to find a site.  At first I was devastated as I only found waist high sting weed for as far as I could see.  I started to press on and the owl kept on and on and on.  I decided to have a second look, as the owls have not deceived me yet, and sure enough, about 30 yards off trail I found a spot to pitch my tent!!  Awesome stuff.I have reached Waynesboro after my last 3000 ft climb until somewhere in CT I believe.  I await the arrival of my good friend from Currituck.  He is coming up to spend a few days in town with me.  I am going to rest for the weekend before I continue into the Shenandoah National Park, the flattest of the trail so far!!  Next stop will be D.C.  There is a train in Harper's Ferry that will take you to D.C. for $13!  I am going to go check out the museums, meet another friend, then continue my trek north.  I am excited to get out of the state of Virginia.  I have 145 miles left in this state of the 547, then I will be right around halfway finished!  Hope all is well and I love you all.","Pearisburg, Va

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595234,"I will forever recall this section as the time of extremes...extreme heat, extreme rain, extreme bugs, extreme wildlife, and extreme itchiness.  When I left Waynesboro, I was in the early stages of what would later be diagnosed as an allergic reaction as I entered the Shenandoah National Park.  Before my first day in the park ended, I was subjected to 90 degree temperatures, stagnant air, and high humidity.  This, in addition to a relentless swarm of midges and my allergic reaction manifesting as an intensely itchy rash covering 75% of my body encouraged me to call it an early evening, setting up my tent in a hurry, climbing in naked and laying in a meditative state for 2 hours in attempt not to lose my mind and scratch my skin clean off.  I survived to continue my trek in the blistering heat and humidity the next morning which then turned into days of torrential downpours, flood warnings, and more bugs in between the bouts of rain.  My rash also continued to torment me, leading me to pound Benadryl as my only means to get any sleep at night.  Needless to say, it was a really tough week.  As for the wildlife, there was MUCH more bear activity in the Shenandoah than the Smokies.  I ran into 6 bears in one day!  The first one was about 20 yards off trail undeterred by my presence. We looked at one another for a few minutes before the bear continued down trail.  The second, seen about an hour later, took off barreling through the woods as soon as we made eye contact.  Later that evening, around 7pm, I turned a corner and found myself among 4 bears! Two very large mamas (largest so far), a cub in a tree, and an adolescent on the ground with the others.  I froze and took a few steps back only to have the larger of the two mothers snort at me.  I waited a few minutes for them to move on before I hurried by.  Definitely the most intense bear encounter so far.  Leaving the Shenandoahs I was greeted with 2 inches of rain in two days before my arrival in Harpers Ferry, one of the biggest milestones on the trail as this is the unofficial halfway point!  I also finally exited Virginia!  A big mental milestone as I have been in Virginia for 547 miles.  I also passed the 1000th mile of the trip.  Some people literally cried once they reached this point.  I was too wet, tired, and itchy to get any more emotional than I already had been.  Although it has been the toughest mental week I have had so far, I would not take it back.  Even in the midst of so many struggles, I have still, in several forms, intimately been witness to the divine energy which dictates the universe.  The harder my journey, the more my appreciation grows, and therefore as does my happiness, as appreciation is the precursor to happiness.  I have formed friendships with other hikers in short bouts of time, as they are experiencing similar struggles. It is most definitely true that misery loves company, however not selfishly.  It makes it easier to laugh at the harsh realities of the trail sometimes when you have someone to laugh it off with, giving insight into why the hiker community is such a close one.  I will be taking a train from Harpers Ferry to D.C. tomorrow to check out the museums I have never visited.  I am being met by some familiar faces, as one will be along with me for a few days as I continue my journey into Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I look forward to this time... and hopefully no more itchiness!!  I love you all.","Waynesboro, VA

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597254,"Before returning to the trail after reaching Harpers Ferry, I took the train into Washington, D.C. for the first D.C. visit of my life.  I was waiting for the train when an announcement was made that the train would not be coming.  Luckily a couple there took me to Brunswick, W.V. to catch the train there instead.  Upon reaching D.C., I was instantly struck by the immense contrast from what I had been experiencing on the trail.  The first thing I noticed, and was a bit taken back by, was the overwhelming population of homeless individuals.  The comedic part of this situation was that I fit right in with them, as I had just come off the trail.  However, to see so many homeless in our nation's capitol, arguably the economic capitol of the world, seemed like an ironic joke.  Within 10 minutes of stepping off the train, I missed the woods.  I was also grateful to have been raised in the rural environment of the mountains of North Carolina.  Although suffering from a bit of culture shock, I did enjoy my time.  I was greeted by some friends of mine and we enjoyed the sights D.C. had to offer, including the monuments, zoo, and Natural History Museum.  It was also nice to get up with some old friends.  Thank you Lori for all that you did for me/us during our time there.  When it came time to hop a train back to Harpers Ferry, my childhood buddy Chris Ray joined me with plans to hike along for a few days.  We started by hiking through the historical section of Harpers Ferry, which was AWESOME.  And as soon as we made it through the town, we were greeted by individuals welcoming us to Maryland.  Maryland was definitely a pleasant surprise with consistent access to its own state parks, monuments, moderate terrain, nice views, and very friendly locals.  It also served as a preview for what we would be experiencing in Pennsylvania, as Maryland had its fair share of rocks.  Shortly after reaching Pennsylvania, Chris left trail and I was left to march on my own.  Later that evening, the temperatures peaked at 105 degrees and stayed there for about a week.  I have learned that nothing slows us down like the heat.  The heat requires more stops for water, more stops for breaks, and more stops to simply avoid the high temperatures.  We hike earlier in the morning, find a place to hide during the peak hours, then continue our hike until late into the night.  But, as things usually do on the trail, things seem to work out.  On the first hot day, I came across Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania, where 1000s of gallons a minute of spring water bubbles from the ground at a consistent 48-50 degrees with easy swimmer access.  This was a very pleasant experience.  Definitely my favorite Pennsylvania feature.  The next day, I was able to take a dip in the Susquehanna River to avoid some of the heat.  The next day, we received 1-3 inches of rain (depending where we were) and were actually battling floods in addition to the heat.  One evening, I actually had to hike 2 miles in ankle deep water, making for a long day, but at least we were cool.  The heat finally broke, and I reached my extraction point to take a few days off and visit some of my family.  Having only 50 more miles of Pennsylvania, the state has definitely left its mark.  Some sections of the trail in this state have been the easiest so far, yet some have also been the most tedious.  What they say about the trail in Pennsylvania is true (""Rocksylvania"").  The terrain has been so rocky and difficult I wore out a pair of boots, broke a trekking pole, and have been subjected to rattlesnakes EVERYWHERE.  Seeing as I have only taken one day off in the last 750 miles of trail, I was due for a little break.  My feet were swollen and sore, my gear needed some repairs, and my spirit replenished through some R and R and family visitations.  I currently have 50 miles left of Pennsylvania (thank goodness), then I will be entering New Jersey then, shortly after, New York.  Although my time in P.A. has been challenging, I have been showered in love by consistent trail magic, friendly locals, and a great week of time with family.  I will individually thank those who have helped me along the way upon my completion, but I feel I must give an early thanks to each of you that have helped me so much lately.  You know who you are, and I thank you so much.  My journey so far would not have been quite the success it has been so far, and will not be quite the success that I know it will be without all of your help.  My appreciation is of the highest.  Thank you all, and I love you very much.  
I also want to explain how things work on the trail from a social aspect, as this is a major part of the experience that is hard to relay through pictures.  Everyone on the trail is just as stinky, wore out, and hairy as the next.  There is no impressing one another through social status, shallow physical attributes, fancy clothes, or material possessions.  On trail, there is no hiding all of our faults, pride goes out the window, and respect is given to each as we know what everyone else is experiencing.  It is literally ""soul"" 24/7.  Because of this, you REALLY get to know people in a very short amount of time.  There aren't too many other experiences which keeps you surrounded by the same people for days at a time in intimate conversation and proximity.  I feel as if you get to know someone within days on the trail in a way that may take several months in the ""real world"".  This leads to significant connections with other hikers, regardless of age, gender, race, etc.  One duo I hiked with for several days included a 50 year old Caucasian man (former military), and a 25 year old multiracial ""kid"".  For whatever reason, these two became the best of friends on the trail, as was evident after only hiking with them for a few hours.  Their friendship continues as they continue to hike together.  The social aspect of the trail has truly restored my faith in humanity.  Since most people on the trail are fulfilling their own agenda, it is difficult to keep up with other hikers for too long a time period, so you are constantly greeting and leaving others, creating a consistent bitter sweet social environment.  The best part about all of this is when you unintentionally bump into a hiker way down trail that you may have not seen in several hundred miles.  It is like being reunited with an old friend, a fantastic feeling.  Now that I have been off for a week, the chances of me bumping into familiar hikers are very slim, unless of course they have done the same.  However, I am confident that I will meet and establish other connections with other hikers from here until finish, as again, it is 100% soul on the trail.  After a solid week of rest, I am ready to tackle my last leg of the trail (945 more miles).  I have reached significant milestones (official halfway point, 1200 miles, etc) and am excited to continue. I am thinking about each of you and am carrying you with me.  Again, thank you and I love you all.","Harpers Ferry, WV

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598187,"I returned to Pennsylvania after a family visit to complete the state, which was also the hardest part of the state.  Pennsylvania was no joke.  Imagine walking on riff raff rocks on and off for approximately 190 miles.  The last 35 miles there were no breaks in the rocks with only one water source.  My last night in Pennsylvania I laid in my tent cramping in several places due to dehydration, resulting from 90+ temperatures, terrible terrain, and no water.  Part of this trek was also completely exposed to the sun, as plants still have difficulty growing due to a zinc smelting plant that used to be in operation in this area.  Company this with another bear sighting and stumbling (literally almost falling on top of) a very large rattlesnake, I was over Pennsylvania.  Closest to breaking any section as brought me.  As I came into the Jersey/Pa border, I ran into several hikers that I knew from before.  As said before, it was like running into old friends, and was exactly the spiritual pick me up needed.  I left Pa and entered a very surprisingly beautiful New Jersey.  Dominated by its remote views and frequent lakes, New Jersey was awesome.  The weather was also perfect!  At times we just felt a little lazy and really took our time.  I even got free pancakes and twizzlers at a hiker stop, two of my favorite foods.  Thoroughly enjoyed New Jersey.  New York welcomed us with a Sou'Easter, the norths equivalent to our Nor'Easters, bringing high winds, inches of rain, and downed trees.  This coupled with rock scrambles the size of houses made for a great change in scenery and a hiker challenge.  New York has also been a pleasant surprise.  The forests are much less dense, but the trees are huge, making for a majestic landscape.  You are also walking alongside ancient farm walls and building remnants along the way.  The trail also took us through Fort Montgomery, NY which walked us through a small zoo.  It was interesting seeing the animals I have been among in the wild locked in captivity.  It was very interesting actually.  I prefer the wild ones.  Tonight I am staying in a shelter awaiting more rain tomorrow.  I am only 26 miles from the Connecticut border!  May reach it tomorrow.  I miss and love you all and think of you often.","Andreas Pennsylvania

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599793,"The past few hundred mile have proven to be a new barrier for thru hikers to push through.  Connecticut brought us back into the mountains with climbs that we have not seen in a long time, adding a toughness to the trail also not seen since the south.  Although brief, Connecticut was challenging.  Even though climbs rarely exceeded 800 feet, there were SEVERAL of them.  However, the end of New York and beginning of Connecticut revealed wildlife to me I have yet to see.  In my last few miles of New York, I saw two solid black squirrels!  Never seen one before.  Then one night, while night hiking alongside the Housatonic River under a full moon in Connecticut, I had a flying squirrel dazzle so close in front of my face, if I had been thinking sharply enough I literally could have reached out and grabbed it from the air before it landing on and ascending up a tree close by.  At first it confused me as it floated down in a way a feather or piece of paper would drift if it were dropped in a windless environment.  A fantastic moment and night on the AT.  The transition into Massachusetts was a beautiful one with Race Mountain (see pics) greeting us close to the border for our first real mountainous view since Virginia.  Beyond this point we were in a constant battle with mosquitos the rest of the state, as it was dominated by swamps, marshes, and beaver ponds.  However, the trail was in great shape for our feet.  Days of rain saw us out of Massachusetts and sent us into Vermont, also known as, and totally deserving, of the nickname Vermud.  This included the climb over Mount Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts, as well as the mountain that inspired the book Moby Dick, as the mountain resembles a large whale.  The first 80 to 100 miles of Vermont was spent in ankle deep mud and water of which there is no avoiding.  You just have to accept that for days you are going to have wet and muddy feet, shoes, and calves.  Mud is also exhausting to hike through, as each step is a battle against gravity and friction (or lack there of).  Finally in Killington we have exited the mud.  Although challenging, Vermont has brought us back into the rugged mountains with spectacular views and 4000 foot mountain tops.  Also interesting is that at 3500 feet at this latitude brings the same biome that 6200 feet brought in the south, dense pine forests which bring the freshest air.  Absolutely beautiful.  Not easily accessible, we are getting a preview for what is to come, The White Mountains and Southwestern Maine, argued to be the most challenging parts of the trail.  There is an excitement among the hikers as we have reached 1700 miles and have less than 500 miles left, yet we are remaining humble and patient as we have a lot of challenges, yet amazing experiences, that still lie ahead.  Some hikers are continuing to battle current challenges which may prevent them from continuing, such as mental and/or physical exhaustion.  One hiker had to take a few days as he started to find blood in his urine, a sign that his body is eating itself.  I have also heard of a few cases of Lymes disease preventing others from continuing.  And some are simply reaching the end of their mental endurance concerning lack of societal comforts.  Every day I am super thankful for my health and continued strength that I hope will allow me to finish this journey smoothly.  The past few hundred miles have been difficult but I have found strength in numbers with surrounding myself with other hikers.  I am currently taking my first day off since July 14th, 450 miles ago, in order to prepare for the White Mountains of New Hampshire which I will be starting next week.  The beauty of the Northeast continues to inspire and humble us all.  We are all amazed that we may only have another month remaining of this journey.  I continue to miss each of you and carry you with me.  Wishing you all well.","Hopewell Junction, NY

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601234,"How blessed I have been these past few hundred miles.  We finally entered New Hampshire and 50ish miles later entered The Whites, hands down the most scenic and beautiful part of the trail I have been witness to thus far.  As can be seen from the pictures, these mountains are unlike any others on the trail.  Dominated by steep climbs and descents, bald rocky tops, and rows and rows of tight ridges, the whites have proven to be challenging yet extremely rewarding.  We have been experiencing 2000-3000 foot climbs/descents in less than 2-3 miles.  Some descents are jokingly described as controlled falls.  Our knees don’t find it quite that funny.  However, the weather has been extremely cooperative during our time over Franconia Ridge, the Presidentials, and the Wildcats, as can also be seen in the pictures.  Only 15 days out of the year does Mount Washington, the most dangerous mountain on trail, have a view, and it just so happened to be clear on our climb.  Climbing up Washington was borderline emotional as we started to feel the level of accomplishment of our hike so far, we felt extremely lucky to have such cooperative/rare weather, and the beauty of the area was so striking it tickled the soul.  More on the emotions in a bit.  The nights have been exceptionally cold though, especially compared to what I am used to for August.  Currently we are experiencing 40 degree nightly temperatures with windy conditions on top of the ridges.  Not quite sure if this is normal for this area or if the temperatures will improve, but either way we will take it as it comes.  We will be exiting The Whites tomorrow and will be entering Maine, our final state, late Saturday or early Sunday.  
Now back to the emotional aspect of this hike.  We have reached a point of exhaustion and pain.  The Whites have been really difficult on our bodies, especially the knees, making most steps taken fairly painful.  And we still have what is said to be the hardest part of the trail on the horizon.  Yet we are all in this together and understand what each person is going through, humbling each of us.  We are also feeling closer and closer to the end, as we only have 300 miles left, which, in the grand scheme of the hike, is the home stretch.  So comes a very bittersweet perception of our current position on the trail.  We are excited to be finishing, we are overwhelmed by what we have accomplished so far, yet refrain from celebrating until we finish, and we can count down in terms of days/weeks rather than months/states.  However, simultaneously and ironically, we are starting to understand how special, transformative, and rare this experience is/has been and the thought of it ending brings sadness, as well.  We find ourselves talking to the Sobos (south bounders that started in Maine and are heading to Georgia), trading notes on what to expect so on and so forth, and through these conversations we realize how much we have learned and experienced on this adventure.  We have also shared these experiences, either directly or indirectly, with several others, creating a unique bond with other individuals on trail.  At the end of this trail, we all go back to our respective places on the planet to tell of our adventure, yet are separated from those we shared it with.  Some of these people I realistically know I will never see again.  It is such an interesting and unique social atmosphere on the trail.  Everyone shares mutual respect for what the others are doing as we all understand the difficulty of the journey, and we all share the same goal and continue to route and cheer for one another.  We continue to bump into one another in towns or on trail, creating a mini, mobile community which feels somewhat exclusive.  I’m not sure where or how else this can be experienced other than through this trail, making it rare and unique.  I have also been fortunate enough to spend more time with some than others throughout my hike.  I have been hiking with the same group of people for the last 400 miles or so, establishing pretty tight bonds that are also unique in that they have been formed in strife and shared tenacity.  And soon this will all end.  This brings the anticipation of sadness along with the anticipation of immense joy of finishing and returning to our homes/friends and families (and dogs).  All of this definitely adds another layer to this experience that would be hard for anyone to understand who has not been involved, yet I see that it is one of the most crucial parts to the hike.  What an adventure this has been.  I continue to miss each of you and am excited to relay to you the best I can this experience over time.  I love you all and carry each of you with me.","Killington, Vermont

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602176,"Shortly after leaving The Whites and entering Maine, our excitement was quickly replaced with disbelief in the difficulty of the terrain southern Maine had to offer, making The Whites seem like a training ground.  The first 4 days in Maine, we were physically incapable of doing more than 10 miles a day.  ‘Hiking’ from sunrise to sunset would only yied limited miles, as the terrain required careful, tedious, and tactful maneuvering, using our upper bodies just as much as our lower bodies.  This was especially true during Mahoosuc Notch, followed immediately by Mahoosuc Arm.  The Notch is a canyon with sheer cliffs on either side.  Over time several boulders the size of cars and houses have fallen into the canyon creating the most difficult mile of the AT.  This one mile took about an hour and a half to complete.  After completing the Notch, the Arm revealed itself to be one of the steepest climbs on the AT, where rock climbing is closer to what was needed to complete this part of the trail rather than hiking.  I was asleep by 7pm after these two features and slept for 11 hours. The terrain gradually eased up and I am back to doing 15-20 mile  days.  It feels good to be able to stride out once again and roll, however I have found myself in one of the more difficult mental stretches of the hike since northern Pennsylvania.  I have been in the final state for more than a week and more than 140 miles, but have yet to make it halfway through Maine.  It feels as if the trail is taunting us, being in the ‘home stretch’ when the stretch is SEVERAL miles and several days long.  Everywhere I go I am congratulated on being nearly done, yet at this moment I still have 150 miles left.  The evenings are nice because I can look back and see how I’ve been picking up my mileage, yet the mornings are daunting as I know I have a lot of ground still to cover.  I have been trying to continue to stay mindful as I know the end is near.  Every waterfall or lake I pass I make sure I take at least a minute to dive in and enjoy myself or at least wash the stink off.  I believe I have about one full week left on trail.  Today I have taken my last trail shower, am making one of my final resupplies, am in my second to last town, and this is my last blog prior to finishing.  The next time I post I will have completed the longest and most difficult foot travel only path in the world, yet I continue to suppress my excitement until the end.  I STILL have challenges ahead which stand between me and the finish.   I will be entering the section known as the 100 miles of wilderness on Thursday, the final stretch before Katahdin.  This is the longest a hiker goes without seeing any trace of civilization on the entire trail.  Then we have Mt Katahdin, a 4000 foot climb in 3.5 miles that leads to the end of the AT.  I miss you all and the anticipation of seeing you continues to push me to get a little further each day.  One more week, 150 more miles.  I’ll see you soon.  Love you all.","Gorham, NH

'Squatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602848,"Exactly 150 days, 2190 miles, 20 pounds, and 4 pairs of boots later, I finally summited Mount Katahdin, finishing the longest footpath in the world, a bucket list item of mine since I first heard of the trail at age 16.  However, prior to summiting, I had to complete the only section of the trail that truly intimated me from the start, the 100 miles of wilderness.  Although more physically demanding than I had anticipated, this section proved to be more emotionally taxing for me than physically or mentally.  I started the wilderness with 4.5 days worth of food, preparing for a 10 mile half day, two 18 mile days, and two 25 mile days, getting me to Abol Bridge (the other side of the wilderness) by the 5th morning for ‘town’ breakfast and a final days resupply.  The first 30 miles of this trek were truly physically challenging, yet the entirety of this section only increased its emotional tease as we pressed further and further into the wilderness.  It was the strangest mental state experienced on trail, and was shared by several other hikers as well.  You can feel yourself getting closer and closer to the end of an epic, and sometimes torturous, 5-6 month journey, creating an excitement that makes it difficult to slow down or sleep, yet simultaneously a sadness pulls at you to be mindful and try to savor every moment as you are aware that soon enough, this journey will end.  To top it off, you periodically get glimpses of Katahdin waiting in the distance, each time getting closer, taunting you with its impressive prominence as the final stage of the trip.  To add to the anticipation and playful torture, at one time you are only 16 miles from the mountain as the crow flies, presenting the illusion you can reach out and grab it, yet still have 38 trail miles to get there.  The wilderness does a great job setting the stage for inevitable reflection undisturbed by the future excitement of the final summit, creating an uncontrollable search for words of summation that just cannot be found.  Tears replace the words that cannot be articulated.  In addition, the elements began to change, as two nights were experienced at below freezing temperatures, with the final day in the wilderness bringing cold AND rain.  The same day we exited the wilderness in the cold rain, we hiked to the base of Katahdin, having to try to sleep with the last challenge staring us in the face.  I was awake by 3:30 am chomping at the bit.  Short Mile and I reached the summit trail at 6:50 am, starting our day in grey clouds and fog, making for a slippery and dangerous ascent.  As we got higher, the mountain actually punched through the cloudy overcast, as did we, giving us blue skies, a beaming sun, and an ocean of fog below us as far as we could see in all directions.  At times it looked as though the fog was lapping at the mountain the way the ocean does to the beach (see pics).  As I approached the final sign, there was no moment of ecstasy or chills of excitement, rather a stillness internally that reflected the environment in which we were presented.  I sat atop the mountain for an hour or so enjoying myself yet that understanding my hike was not TRULY over until I descended, which proved to be extremely dangerous and difficult as we reentered into the clouds.  We actually came upon a hiker who had just fallen and suffered from symptoms of severe concussion, including lack of consciousness.  After recovery, we helped the man to his feet and got him safely off the mountain.  In appreciation, the injured hiker’s family took us into the next town to exit the trail for the last time.  Finally the hike was over.
The last few nights, including the night after the summit, were very special in that they were spent with other hikers reflecting and talking of our shared and unique experiences of the tail.  At this current moment on a bus to Boston, I find myself completely removed from the trail and those I spent this time with for the first time in 5 months.  The transition is still in its process and proves to be the most bitter-sweet experience of my life.  I know the totality of this experience has impacted my soul very deeply, yet I also know I will not completely understand how much so until time is spent back in the environment in which I was in prior to the beginning of the hike.  I have yet to find the words of summation, and any one uttered will be from a place of premature conclusions and naivety.  As a mirror provides a physical reflection enabling you to see yourself and how you have changed, others provide an internal reflection in which you can see yourself.   I know this will take time and exploration.  
Although I feel accomplished in finishing, I did not accomplish this on my own.  There are several of you that were a part of this journey whether you were physically there, gave assistance in some way, or simply provided words of encouragement, and for that I thank all and each of you.  I love you all and am thankful and most appreciative.  This would not have been the same without each act of kindness you bestowed.  So thank you, thank you, thank you.  I am excited to see each of you and relay as much of this experience as possible.  
There is something very unique about the adventure the AT provides.  Never have I had an experience test my mind, body, and spirit to the extent of the trail experience, while simultaneously setting each of them free.  My soul is full.","Caratunk, Maine
