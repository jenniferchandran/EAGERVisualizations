 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581854,70 days to go! My stomach is fluttering constantly. I plan to take some pics of my gear over the weekend so you guys will see my prep. Also getting the household ready for my extended absence. Don’t think I’ll feel better til I take a few hundred steps at Springer.,"

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581949,"So, I’ve gotten my pack stuffed with my gear and 3 days of food for a total of 25 lbs. even! Pretty good and I’ll add 2 bottles of water. The picture shows my gear plus my Black Diamond trekkers and Osprey Aura pack. Also, trying an umbrella for rain and wet set up...also can shield my pack outside the tent. I have a Big Agnes Fly Creek 1 which is adequate but not ultra roomy. Other gear: ThermaRest Neo Air pad, Jetboil, head lamp, Sea to Summit pillow (my only luxury), sleeping bag rated 19 degrees. Those are the biggies. Now to wait. anyone else starting 3/15/18?","

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582133,"So... due to my husband’s schedule, I have to adjust my start date. Originally, I was going to leave on 3/15/18 but now I will be leaving on 3/18/18. I may possibly be in a Sunday bubble and that is ok to ensure my husband can wave to me as I walk away! And I will now due the approach trail too. I knew flexibility would be needed and this is not a tough decision. First change done! Long Haul ready to get moving!","

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582622,"So, I have stopped working... a bit early which put a stop to savings for the trek but I think I am ok that way. I have amped up my training to 2x/day with the full pack and doing stairs a couple times a week. I am sore but know it is good prep.I will forego the approach trail since hubs is sure he can take the time to drive me up the forest road so I’ll take it. Got my AWOL guide and was immediately overwhelmed with information. Slowly making myself familiar with it. I am debating bear canister vs. bag, Hubs thinks the canister would be best until TN ends (nearly 500 miles with the 2 lbs of extra weight). I have managed to get 4 full days of food into the canister and it feels ok in the pack. I like the idea of a dry seat and not having to waste time hanging a bag (I am ok at this task). Plus after a full day of hiking, I am lazy and tend to be a night snacker after recovery time and camp chores...so I am leaning this way.Pack weight fully loaded is just over 25lbs without water so it is doable. Anyone else stressed just waiting? The anticipation is huge. About 45 days to trek-off!","

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583280,"Getting super excited to start! Not bringing the canister.... too heavy. Wish I could start earlier but drs.appt, dentist and helping hubs at his office right before my start date. Still training and overthinking... just need to get out there. Tracking a few early starters and love their updates. Yah!!","

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583594,"I’ve decided to leave a week earlier.... I’m not doing much just sitting here anxiously so...I’m going! Pack fully loaded is 27.8 lbs. Wish it were 20 but the stuff is needed. Now, hubs and I are just reviewing logistics. I’m nervous and excited... looking forward to meeting others and growing stronger as a hiker. Springer...here I come!","

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584651,"So, I have found that it is very difficult to update this journal from the trail. So, now on an extended zero, I can catch up a bit.  I left the trail yesterday during a rare NC mountain snowstorm that became ominous when I arrived at a snow filled and people full Muskrat Shelter. I was soaked, all water frozen and no room for me. I quickly let my emotions pull me down to panic and tears. I called my husband who drove 5 hours to come and rescue me after a harrowing shuttle ride down USFS71. I was truly afraid I could not last the night without help as I was too cold to put up my tent in the 4-5 inched of accumulated snow and no stove to heat water. All my clothes were soaked. Thank goodnesss for Tim the shuttle man who arrived to rescue Miami Univ. Students. He drove me down USFS71 knowing my husband’s truck could not navigate the road. The univ. Guides let me sit in their van until he arrived. I feel saved. So I am resting up and will return to the trail this weekend with many lessons learned.I’ll be downloading ATweather.org to my phone so I can better gauge the weather and never walk into a snowstorm unprepared again. I am reshuffling my pack to be more prepared. Also, will be using my tent more as mice ate thru my rain pants and my pack (at the top so it is still weather proof).Prayers for the hikers who chose not to get out of the mountains and very grateful I was close enough to home to be rescued. Now I have time to heal bruises, burned face (from sun and wind) and swollen eyes!","

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584781,I’m ready to head back to the AT! I feel healed and well fed and my gear has been improved! Hubs will drop me mid-morning at Deep Gap and I will get some miles in on Sunday. I hope I haven’t lost my beginning trail legs but so be it. Onward! Thanks for all the kind messages...so appreciated. I will make a better effort to update this journal going forward.,"

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585945,"It’s been a true challenge for me to reach 200 miles! The trail goes up and down constantly, is rugged, uneven and rutted and I feel real accomplishment! My feet are aching and I am on a zero to rest them up for the final push out of the smokies. I got off the mountain yesterday because the weather was turning icy and snowy. A high light for me yesterday was walking thru the woods and seeing a doe not 50 feet from me ambling around as if I were not there! My husband will meet me here in Gatlinburg for a visit - he’s a real trail magician to do so much support for me... couldn’t do it without him.The trail is still crowded with 25-30 people at shelters at night. Even so, it can be lonely when I miss my hubs and home. The true challenge for me is staying committed to this trek. Prayer helps! The weather is still wintry and very cold at night. Hard to get going in the freeze. But I’m going to keep going!","

 Journalist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588500,I am ending my hike today. I am not enjoying myself being largely alone. I am also having some health issues that make continuing too much. I feel relieved and disappointed. I owe my husband a deep debt for putting up with me vascillating during this decision making process! Best of luck to all who continue...,"
