Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582619,"The big hike is about 2 1/2 months away. My fiance and I decided to embark on a thru-hike in August for April 2018. Some might call us crazy and others I know at least think we are without saying. We are selling the house, leaving our jobs and have no set in stone plans for our return. We are true vagabonds come April. The start date of April 19th is based on trying to avoid the crowds, as it is a later start than usual. We have considered the miles needed to hike and feel this is realistic that we can make Katahdin before it closes in mid October. We have sectioned hiked about 530  miles of the trail near our home in MA reaching north into N.H. and South into New Jersey. 
I am the crazy researcher and my partner is the go with the flow. I wish I was a little more like her, I would probably be less stressed but I do love doing the research. I have read countless books and have planned extensively.I have mapped out approximate drop box towns. The plan is to stop once a week for a resupply and every other week for a box that my friend will be mailing us. 
I am worried about food since I love food. I have read that you burn about 6000 calories a day which means lots of food to achieve energy levels needed to hike 12-20 miles daily with 25-35 pounds on your back.
Anyway the jitters have begun. I am starting to think about how much I will miss my family and friends. Like I said, I know lots probably think we are crazy but I feel they understand and are supportive. I'm going to miss my daughter immensely. I have spoken to her on many occasions at this point and I'm comfortable with my decision, though if needed I would change my plans in a heart beat. It has been keeping me up at night, hence I am writing this in the early morning. I will also miss my grandson terribly. He will turn 2 while we are gone. I will miss my mom and worry about her as well, although I have spoken to family that will be helping her. I am making plans to have visits with them during zero days and to stay in touch when reaching towns. I know they will be here when I return and I will carry them along with me on my journey in my heart. I hope to pass on what I learn and discoverer from this adventure to them. Needless to say my biggest obstacle is missing my family and friends. I have made a list of why I am hiking to remind myself when I have moments of despair, worry and guilt that I am surely going to experience. I have started this journal as a way to stay in touch and so that my family and friends can be with me through my days.
I will share my list of reasons another time but for now I am going to try to get some sleep before my handsome but very energetic grandson awakes. 
Happy trails.

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582635,"My research in the last few days has been on estimated daily mileage in the two most difficult states N.H. and M.E. I have approximate estimations for where our boxes will be shipped in every section from Georgia-Vermont. This is definitely a challenge as the trail becomes very difficult causing a significant drop in daily miles. I think I'm going with approx. 10 with a few different options for towns with post offices that are not far off trail, which I have somewhat followed with what I have so far. These states will be less defined, which bothers me. Lol Control issues, possibly. 
Anyway, this is all estimations based on our hiking history, books, talking to others and reading journals.
After this is complete, I'm moving on to best zero day towns which I have some info. on. This will be very important because I will feel more relieved that I have a plan to see my daughter and grandson. Once we are closer to MA they will be coming to us for overnight visits. I'm not sure the exact details but I will feel relieved when I have a few location options to share. 
So, the list of reasons for the big hike, leaving out a few person reasons.
1. The obvious, I love to hike. I love the woods, the mountains, fresh air, cool lakes, amazing water falls sleeping under the stars, being part of nature. The smells, vistas, leaves under foot, being surrounded by big trees especially white birch and conifers. I like hiking long and hard, accomplishing a goal, reaching a destination only to begin again in the morning. I will list the rest another time.
Still have not chosen a trail name, any suggestions would be appreciated.
Well of to sleep.
Happy trails,

2. To evaluate my life. A new beginning. When I return, I'm hoping to have a better idea of what direction I would like to move in.  A clean slate, blank canvas. 
3. To reconnect with God. To build a stronger relationship. 
4. To rediscover/ discover what I believe in. Discover what changes I can make and what I must accept. Forgiveness of myself and others. To let go. To move on. Ponder what is important to me and to leave behind what is not.
5. Process and accept the loss of my Nana. Spend time with her spirit. I will be bringing something with me and leaving it on top of Mount Katahdin.
6. Personal growth. I'm sure there will be lessons along the way. I'm hoping to be a stronger person for my daughter. To pass along some kind of wisdom and strength to her.  
7. A few other personal reasons.
8. The challenge. If I don't make it at least I can say I tried. 
I realize some of these reasons are corny, but that's me and I don't mind sharing them.

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582729,"We have an estimated box drop route with 10 boxes with an approximate every two week pick-up. We continue buying more food for the boxes. I have been dehydrating mostly fruit but will be trying jerky this weekend. Im super nervous about food. I hate being without so I usually end up carrying more than needed which is just dead weight. Im hoping to work on this. 
We will be carrying 4/5 days of food with two town stops to resupply, then a box with dry food and resupply of fresh food. There is also spots to stop fotr a meal and of course trail magic! I noticed a lot of towns are in close proximity in the south for easy access to food.The shanhandona  National Park has a lot of meals along the trail side. The Whites in N.H. have the huts which have meals. 
My mom is worried that I will get lost or a number of other scary scenarios but my only worry is lack of food. 
I am not looking forward to Trail hunger but the large quantities of town food adds to the enjoyment of the town stops. 
After all, you have to love the fact of eating what ever you want in large quantities and losing weight in the process. 
On to figuring out our Zero and Nero days which I think will end up being the towns we pick up our boxes in. Happy trails!",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Wed",0
Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584182,"Looks like it is a go for our trip. The house is on the market but there have been no offers. We have decided to leave anyway and have help to deal with the house while we are gone. We are due to leave in about 5 weeks. We have so much to do. Get our stuff in storage, flight tickets, last minute items. We are almost finished packing our 10 boxes, except for the food we have been collecting. After we finish with the odds and ends we will move onto the food. I will feel better once we have the boxes all set. There is a lot of organizing and estimating that goes into the preparation but we are having fun doing it. I’m thinking we have extra stuff but we can bounce stuff forward to ourselves of pass on some stuff in the hikers boxes along the way. March is flying by....of course the snow doesn’t help and three storms in less than 2 weeks takes time away from the business that has become of getting geared up.

Even though we have been preparing for approx. 6 months it seems we still have a lot to do. The to do list is shrinking but I’m feeling a little anxious about time. We put the house on the market mid February but it has not been going well. (Too long of a story) The hope at this point is that there is at least a buyer before we leave. We started looking at storage units and will start moving our stuff in April 1. We haven’t purchased the flight tickets because although we have decided that we will leave before the house is finalized there are other things that are not completely settled. By April 1, I believe we will have a definite decision made. I really hope this will work out for us but we have a second plan of a June trip from Maine to Georgia. It’s a weird place to the not knowing if we are coming or going, and exactly where we are going. Lol. It’s in God’s hands.",,One month from our start in Georgia,"Mar 18, Sun",0

We have been prepping for months now and we are down to buying the last of the food we need and packing it in box 7-10. The boxes will be complete and we will fully be prepared. We have had a lot of recent difficulties that have distracted us from preparing. It has been very difficult to say our goodbyes. We had my mom over and I cooked dinner and we played rummie. I dropped my mom off at the airport the next morning for her flight to her brother’s house in Florida. It was very emotional and I had mixed feelings about not seeing her for six months which included fear, anxiety and sadness. I will stay in touch via messenger which seems to be our main mode of communication. Next is Barkley who we will be bringing to Stacy’s parents in N.H. We will be staying the night and saying our goodbyes to the family. It’s difficult to get ready for this trip as well as prep for the house and move our belongings into storage. I’m looking forward to finally being on the trail Thursday and being with nature and God. I don’t just want this journey but I need it.",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Wed",0
Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587278,"Well we were supposed to be on the trail today but had some delays. Eventually we will get to Springer Mountain; hopefully tomorrow morning. I will admit that I am not to disappointed as I am really sick. I’m guessing it happened when I decided to play airplane with Cam propping him up on my legs and flying him over me; when the drool reached my face I figured his sickness might rub off on me. We really didn’t have the best planning for the start of our hike because of other stressors before leaving.  Things worked out just the way they should have, giving me an extra night to get well. We also met the nices people today, folks in Georgia are really friendly and kind. We had a great start sharing our love for Cam with our waitress Paige who decide to give us a coupon for our breakfast. We then got an offer from Jim who had a training at the hotel to join in the lunch buffet. We struggled with finding a ride to a hotel 1 1/2 hours from our location in Atlanta. A few rides fell through and when we were about to give up we got a ride from a very nice man named Robert. We had many different interesting conversations with Robert who charged us a very reasonable price especially compared to the prices we were expecting to pay. All in all it was a good day, with plenty of sunshine and the mountains in view. Time to get some much needed rest.",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Thu",0
Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587750,"We finally made it onto the trail on Springer Mountain where we ran into Scrapbook the first thru-hiker I have met off trail. I met scrapbook at the bus station where he was waiting for his shuttle. At only 20 y.o. he as hiked the PCT and the CDT. He has this spirit that makes me smile. We ran into him again at Neels Gap last night after hiking down in the rain. Ge was staying at the hostel and hiking out this morning.
 We decided to take a zero day to avoid hiking in the rain giving me more time to get over this sickness and to hopefully prevent Stacy from getting sick. We head back on the trail in the a.m. Pot will be our shuttle back. It’s not what you think or what I thought when he first told me his trail name. He actually carries a POT up the trails to cook real food for thru-hikers when he is not shuttling. We will be dropped off at the trail head we left off at which is also an outfitter. I am going to have a (shakedown) in which they will go through my bag and help me lighten the load. My pack is 16 lbs without food and water and 26 lbs with water and 4 days of food. That’s pretty good but I do think I have more than I need. I will not let them take my trolls, which I take pictures of to send to Cam. That is how I got my trail name Nana Troll. I think it is fitting. 
Georgia has been smooth like rolling hills compared to the mountains our way. Blood mountain which is named after two Native American tribes battle was a little difficult in the rain. What I love the most so far are the little wild flowers growing along side the trail, the huge Rhododendron Forrest we walked through, and a field of what I believe were some form of Lilies growing in large numbers covering the mountain floor. Also the huge owl that was perched on a tree at the campsite we stayed at last night. She lived by the campsite picking off the mice that overtake the shelters. We believe it is a female because it seems she carries the mice to a nest that we believe may hold babies. I know gross but less mice for us and food for baby owls, hmmm. 
Off to get some rest and hoping to feel even better for tomorrow morning.

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588122,"Georgia has been beautiful. Yesterday was a tough 14 mile hike up a couple miles with hard down hikes with not many switchbacks. Ouch on the knees. Today we hiked 10 miles to town made it into town at 1:30 which was great timing. Enough time to do our laundry, eat Mexican, and resupply. I have been icing my knee and taking care of my sore feet. Penguin ( a new trail friend from the U.K.) came in with speedy and then a few other thru-hikers joined. I was happily surprised to spend some time with these people you chat with for a little on the trail. This was nice because we tend to avoid the shelters. I was especially happy to run into scrapbook again who I met at the train station. 
This section has been refreshing as there was plenty of water with all these cool waterfalls. Looking up you had the waterfalls coming down right over the trail and downward. It felt somewhat like walking through a waterfall. There was also a lot of rock walls with water trickling down along the switchbacks. It was like a meditation trail. I saw this really cool white bird flying through the cloud mist.  I have no idea what kind of bird it was but I only saw that one. The cold and rain continues and last night was quite windy yet I wasn’t very cold. The forcast is calling for a number of warm nice days ahead of us. Yay! Tomorrow we will leave Georgia and enter the N.C. section. I am very excited to see what this section will bring. 
We will hit Franklin our first N.C. town in a few days to re-supply. Till then Happy Trails!","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589020,"N.C. has been a little challenging but I’m looking forward to The Smoky Mountains which is a few miles into the next section. We are in Fontana a nice little hiker town with a bed, restaurant, laundromat and store. These are the all the amenities needed for a hiker. It’s like heaven when coming off the trail. How simple life has become. We hiked our butts off to get here. We hiked 27 and 1/2 miles in 1 and 1/2 days of tough terrain, which started with an 8 mile hike up a mountain that was brutal. Needless to say, we were thrilled when we finally got here. I was literally delirious, laughing uncontrollably after the first day of hiking 16.4 miles when we couldn’t find flat ground to hang out hammocks. 
The start of N.C was beautiful, breathtaking vistas and areas of beautiful smelling wildflowers, which was a much needed relief from the smell of us. Lol. There have been countless really cool butterflies all along the way. Although we  have seen plenty of bear scat, still no bears. Our friends had a close encounter with a bear which turned out to be a funny story for another time. The bear came back and stole a bear bag which later was found scattered in a grave of trail food wrappers. 
I stayed at a hostel three nights ago which was a first for me. That day was a long trek but the most interesting and inspiring day of the trail so far. We spent three miles helping Pathfinder get to camp. Pathfinder is a 76 year old woman hiking her way to Maine. She hopes to be the oldest woman thru-hiked. She was in dire straights when we ran into her on a cliff area of the trail. She took a picture thinking she was going to die there, which she was perfectly fine with. She has some family support but others have called her crazy. We fell in love with her. Stacy and I along with another tail friend Braveheart were taking turns carrying her pack. Another hiker came along and took her pack down to camp as we helped her get there safely. I think of Pathfinder everyday since we met. It may take a long while and help from others for her to make it but I am behind her all the way. 
Today, we are going to get our passport to enter the Smokies and get back on the trail. The Smokies border N.C and Tenesssee. At some points we are in N.C. and others we are in Tennessee. So, off to eat a very big breakfast. Hikers hunger has finally kicked in. Hoping for some grits and Sweet tea. I have enjoyed the southern food. Yum! 
Happy trails till next time.

",Great Smoky Mountains,"May 04, Fri",94.90
Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589500,"Yesterday we hiked 18 miles which included Clingmans Dome at 6,643 feet in the Smoky Mountains, which is the highest point on the AT as well as just about the 200 mile marker. We hiked our butts off and got to Gatlinburg T.N. a day early, honestly out of hunger and exhaustion. We took a (zero) hikers lingo meaning 0 miles, a day off the trail. We usually hike through town to re-supply or take a (Nero) hikers lingo for hiking 10 or so miles a short day and then either staying in a hostel/hotel and back on the trail the next morning or just going right back out. We are back on the trail in the morning for a 16 mile hike which is needed as we need to skip a shelter, the second of which we needed to skip due to ( moms don’t read this part) “aggressive bear activity.”
The Smoky Mountains are beautiful. We have seen more wildlife here than anywhere on the trail so far. We saw a bear the first day. Stacy says it wasn’t close but as far as I’m concerned it came bolting down a tree I believe what looked as though right towards me, however it fled down the ravine. Then we woke to two deers visiting the shelter. We also ran right into a baby deer who just looked up at us and continued eating. We also saw rabbits and a fat salamander. There are so many birds. Also, this baby blue stone everywhere that looks like slate. The wildflowers are everywhere and smell so good. The most amazing are the Mountain View’s that you just can’t capture in pictures. Layers upon layers with puffy clouds above and sometimes we actually were walking through them. 
We decided to take a zero because speaking for myself, I was tired and my hunger was out of control. I’m going back on the trail with more food this time. It’s hard to keep the high amount of calories needed for the energy. If you don’t eat enough you eventually hit a wall. Also, my knees, ankles and feet were begging me to take a break. I feel healthy, healed and ready to hit the trail again. Gatlinburg T.N. has been quite the experience. I’m not sure how to explain it. It’s like a big carnival in the middle of the Mountains. Dolly Parton shows, moonshine, old fashion photos, pancake houses, circus stuff. etc. What I liked best was the BBQ ribs and pulled pork with slaw and baked beans, best I will probably ever have. Of course the sweet tea and grits are still on the top of my list. 
The next town we hit is Hot Springs N.C. The AT borders N.C. and T.N. You never know which state you are in. I’m looking forward to Hot Springs, for what else but the hot springs. It is a hikers town that the AT runs right through. I’m sure I’ll be hungry by then.
Happy trails until then....

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590346,"Said good bye to the Smokies a couple days ago. I really loved the Smokies, it is a beautiful and wild mountain range. I could feel the wild life all around at all times. We entered the Blue Ridge Mountains which has been absolutely covered with wildflowers. We spotted a brilliantly red small bird, not sure what kind but not a cardinal. In a small area there were three snakes, two small and one large black snake. A mouse did nibble through my pack holder on my pack and tried to steal my almonds in the middle of the night. We also spotted a black newt which was unusual and cool. 
Again, we hiked 18 miles to town for food, rather than camping then hiking in a few miles in the morning. This seems to be a pattern, thanks to my belly. We made it to Hot Springs N.C. almost 300 miles into the hike and took 2 zero days. The Hot springs are very healing. My body has needed a rest as my feet have been bothering me. This is an interesting hikers town. It’s been a little challenging finding a place that has WiFi, laundry facilities and a T.V. in one place, however we made the best of it. Tonight we had a nice meal with two trail friends that has proved to be exactly what I didn’t expect from this hike. I thought I was leaving people to be with nature and spirit only to find my journey includes people. Who would have thunk. I’m learning about myself and healing along the way with others. I feel blessed to have met a lot of new friends, mostly Braveheart and Penguin. We are all on this journey for a reason and I’m discovering that some of those reasons have yet to be revailed. 
It’s way past hikers midnight and I’m back on the trail in the morning. Heading towards Erwin T.N.

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590971,"This section has been interesting. We have seen many snakes including a very large rattle snake. There have also been different lizard type creatures. Also, many different wild flowers than we have seen. 
My favorite hike came in this section when we hiked with our trail friends. It was a beautiful day. We usually hike alone and meet up at the shelter or town. We hike similarly so we run into each other often. So on this day when we hiked together we encountered the rattle snake. We saw three black snakes and many lizards. The best sighting was a cub that climbed a tree then pulled his body along a fallen tree. We only stayed to watch him play briefly as we had no idea where mama bear was. 
The last few days have not been ideal hiking as there continued to be scattered thunder storms. It’s quite an experience hiking with loud thunder and lightening overhead. Sleeping with the sound of rain drops on the rain fly and thunder in the background is actually a cool experience. I’m getting use to hiking in the rain, it’s just not fun setting up or taking down camp. Carrying water logged rain fly adds weight and everything is just damp. The worst is the blisters I continue to battle as hours and miles of walking in puddles do damage. 
We came off trail to dry our stuff in a cabin on a awesome farm. The family are bee keepers and have chickens that wander the property. It’s on a rushing river that we took a dip in as we waited for our clothes to dry. I lay in a hammock overlooking the river after a day of Mexican food and food shopping. We have full bellies and fresh food for our return to the trail in the morning. 
Tonight we watched so many fire flies dancing in trees. They put on a spectacular show. It was a great end of a very productive and beautiful stay on this farm.

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591551,"We said goodbye to N.C. two days ago and hiked into Roan T.N. The trail follows the border of N.C. and T.N. for a while but we are now in T.N. completely until we enter Damascus V.A. in 75 miles. We plan to be there in 5 days. We are taking this section easy as my spirits are low because of the rain. People say to embrace the rain but no matter how are I try I just can’t do it. I hate the rain. I hate hiking in it and setting up in it and taking down in it. I got my first blister because of hiking in wet boots and I have chafe under my armpit area from my wet shirt from the constant contact. I fell for the first time but nothing major. I’m trying to change my attitude but we start our hike today again in the rain. We had a day off so I should be happy. We ate lots of food and let our bodies rest. We stayed in a tree house room in a hostel which was cool.  The last section was beautiful with lots of bolds at high elevations. We were being chased by a cloud that we out hiked only to have another cloud around the corner. We are going to try to out-hike the thunderstorm heading this way, I think we are going to lose. Lol. 
Anyway, we shall be in V.A. and almost 500 miles into the hike in 5 days.

",Damascus V.A.,"May 23, Wed",50.90
Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592724,"We crossed over into V.A. and past the 400 mile mark. We will be in V.A. for a while, over 500 miles. The Southern part has been interesting. The first section had lots of waterfalls falling down large rock outcropping. Laurel Falls was amazing and part of the trail went around a gorge. There were lots of raspberries flowering but no fruit yet. The rhododondrons and Azaleas are in bloom and spill colors along side the trail along with new wild flowers. 
We continue to meet interesting people. Two of which forage for most of their food. I was adventurous and tried the snake that they caught and some oyster mushrooms. I suppose I took a chance but the snake was great and I’m still kicking.  
We took a zero in this hiker town of Damascus. Spent time with our trail family and other hikers. We are headed to Marion V.A. next where we will make lodging arrangements for Mimi, Dom and Cams visit in Pearisburg. I am so excited to see everyone and to hold Cam, it’s all I think about.","
",Marion V.A.,"May 29, Tue",63.60
Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593550,"Marion V.A. was a great town. We spent time with two of our friends with the best and most interesting event being the blue-grass show which will air on PBS in a few months. We (the audience) had to continue to clap for long periods of time which we did with great enthusiasm after each band. There were five bands that had there own unique and interesting style. There were two men who added comedy to their banjo and guitar duo style. They were quite entertaining when you could make out their words through the southern twang. 
We made plans for the next stop in Pearisburg (102.7 miles) which we planned to do in 7 days. We made arrangements for a hotel for two nights in which we would have a visit from Cam, Mimi and Dom. We finished in 5 days, 2 days early. We are building confidence in ourselves and hiked 25 miles the last day, of course for food and drinks. My craving continues to be soda but also fresh fruit. The hostel we chose while waiting for Cam, Dawn and Dom was right behind a grocery store. Perfect! Now we are waiting in anticipation for Mimi and Dom to drive up tomorrow to pick us up. We will have two days to spend with them. I just can’t wait to put my arms around Cam and smother him with love! 
I have mixed feelings for Southern V.A. so far. I absolutely loved the Grayson Highlands. It has been my favorite section along with the Smokies. Going over large boulders with curiosity of what is on the other side to find beautiful expanses of land. The trail continued along another cluster of boulders and soon the wild ponies were in view. At first a couple of them but over the next cluster groups of them. They were wandering along the trail and seemed to have no worry or fear as they approached to lick the salt from your hands and arms. 
Southern V.A. has been smoother than the rest, lots of ridges and ledges. The farmland and cow pastures I enjoy. Walking through as the cows look up is always a weird feeling. I want to say, “sorry for interrupting go back to your business we are just passing through.” Like the Smokies I feel like I’m in the presence of lots of wildlife. In one day we saw a snake, deer, and heard a bear, of course along with the common wildlife.  I noticed the sounds of crickets multiplied. Also, the smells have changed. Some areas of meadows have smelled so good that it instantly and pleasantly changed my mood in seconds. I would wander along at a slow pace to take it in. I also became aware of the hawks in flight. With such few views the one that stands out was on an overcropping of rocks with mountains in the distance and hawks gliding overhead. The best part of this section was that we hiked 5 days with sunshine and no rain, now that’s something to be grateful for. 
The downside are the many rocks that seem to come and go and when present go on for miles. I have been fighting the disappointment of the elevation climb of 2,500 feet in 2 miles with no reward (a vista) with the feeling of pride and accomplishment; that through the sweat and hard climb we made it to the top of another mountain.
If anything Southern V.A. has taught me that if I made it this far I can make it to Mount Katadin M.E. I have gained confidence that I can accomplish what I set my mind to do. Yes it is a physical challenge and you need to take care of your body but this is a mental challenge. The strength comes from your thoughts. If you tell yourself I can get over this mountain then you will get over that mountain and the next and next. 
Hikers interesting tidbits.....
You can tell a thru-hiker from a section hiker because you can smell them before they even get close to you. Most hikers have one set of hiking clothes and one set of camp clothes. Hiking 6-10 hours a day (15-20+ miles) for days-weeks sweating the whole way, equals a smell that can not be described. One of my motivations for hiking 25 miles to the hostel was that after 5 days I couldn’t stand my own smell. Seriously!!! I contemplated hiking in my bra, only thing stopping me was the chafe I would have gotten on my shoulders. Chafe another hikers strife.","

He also showed off his ability to identify all of the alphabet and to recite them. The day we went back on trail and the few that followed I was grateful but I began to become home sick. I also think we hiked too much as we we were keeping up with a friend we would be saying by to as she was leaving the trail. We hiked 68 miles in 3 1/2 days ending with two 20 mile days to a hostel. The hostel ended up being a nightmare for many reasons they can be left unsaid. Stacy quickly got us out of there contacting an old friend from when she lived in Roanoke V.A. and we caught a ride 12 miles to her friends children’s house. We were rescued by the generosity of her friend who I met the next day. I was happy to meet this kind woman who Stacy often spoke of. We re-supplied, hit a Waffle House, Krispy Creame and sheetz, all of which we do not have our way. I am very home sick and I can’t wait to get home on June 27th for a quick visit with my family. I am most looking forward to spending time with Amanda whom I miss terribly and my mom. We will be staying with Dawn so I have another opportunity to cuddle with Cam. Southern V.A. has finally grew on me. We continue to hike the ridge line but with awesome views. We have had three great vistas at which we camp near, the last being Mcafee Knob, which we watched the sun set. The next morning we ate breakfast and got some photos hanging on the edge of the cliff of the knob. It is the most photographed vistas on the A.T. and seen as the most beautiful vista in V.A. The sky was beatiful as the sun went down. We reached this location after a 20 mile hike with two tough mountains to hike, one in the morning and one in late afternoon. The day before was a 20 mile day which ended with Dragon’s  tooth. Dragon’s tooth is a spectacular monolith on Cove mountain. It is a huge rock with crevices outcrops that allow for a 360 view. If you dare, you can climb to the top, which I did when I saw my friend waving to me. It was a scary climb but a more cautious climb down. There has been a lot of wildlife in this section. We were awoken by sounds all night of something walking around our hammock. I believe the culprit were deer and was hoping that it was not a bear as I waited for the sounds to end, only to be awoken again and again. Gulp! The following day we saw two bears and two deers, it will remain a mystery as to what was surrounding us the night before. We have not had any bad experiences with wildlife but met a woman (Cajun fire) last night had quite an experience with a hungry bear that I will leave to the imagination. We have passsed the 700 mile marker to 729.2 miles and today will pass into the 1/3 marker. I feel like the V.A. blues may have passed as we enter Northern V.A. today. The visit home will help. I am aware that when home I may not want to return. However the real world can wait until I push on and discover a little more about who I am and what I want for my future. Hiker tidbits: switchbacks are trails that smoothly and slowly incline along a mountain allowing you to get to the top without going straight up. Switchbacks are our friends but apparently V.A. does not believe in them leaving us to hike straight up the majority of the time. Dam you Virginia.","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594973,"The last few days have been the most enjoyable. Hiking more my style lately. Hiked 13.5 miles to a campground the other day, ate real food, showered and swam in a pool. We spent 3 hours there relaxing. We got back on trail and hiked an additional 4 miles reaching our average 17.5 these days. We chose an awesome camp site without even knowing it until the sun went down and hundreds maybe more fire flies put on an amazing light show. It was totally indescribable. I just soaked in the awe! The following day we took a long lunch break about 1 hour at a shelter in which we patiently waited for the thunderstorm to pass. As we hiked on I realized that although I hate the rain it serves many purposes and it is quite pleasant to hike in after it has passed. It intensifies the meadows fragrance and it cools the humid air. I even wrote a poem about the it. Lol As the day before we still hiked our 17+. That night while looking at the trees in my hammock I saw two woodpeckers in clear view after seeking out a woodpecker during this whole hike. We also had a visitor. A very chill deer that was perfectly happy sharing his space with us. Today we hiked to this hostel and met some more very interesting people. Although I continue to enjoy my alone time with my higher power, I am learning so much from the people on this trail. To be fair anyone hiking this trail is just as crazy as I am. I am really loving the trail. I love the good, the hard, the struggles, the ups and downs. I love it all. I feel connect to the mountains, woods, meadows and surrounding land. I can now identify the difference between the sound of a snake, squirrel, bear, or deer. Stacy is happy because I have stopped asking her “what was that”. I can tell the time by the sun. I listen to the birds while I get ready to sleep and I know they will be sleeping soon when I hear the whip-poor-will start chirping. It makes a distinct sound and it is the last bird to sing before it becomes silent. Then I know the birds will awake in the morning when the whip-poor-will starts the morning with his song. The birds are my alarm clock. I try to ignore them but eventually I give in and get my butt ready for what ever the day holds for us. Mostly,  I have a better concept of things not being in my control. It’s easier to turn your will over to your higher power when your higher power is all you have to depend on. The day is totally in my higher powers hands. I just go with the flow. Hiker tidbits: Spider web duty belongs to the first hiker to hike the trail that morning. It’s no fun but someone has to go through the spiderwebs created over night on the path. Keep your mouth closed or you will be snacking on spider webs. Good thing I’m not an early bird.","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595356,"Stanimals in Glasgow has been one of our favorite hostels. It’s in someone’s house and is run by people doing work for stay. When we got there I met three strong women, two which are older than myself. It is amazing how many strong woman there are out here, most of which are solo hikers. There is a confidence that I feel is more in my reach. Sometimes the trail changes for people. One of the women had an injury but she is not going home. She will hike it a different way, she will heal and move on in a different direction as she will not make it in time to Katadin. She will celebrate in another area on the trail with her family when she completes the 2,200 miles. Another trail friend was not having fun and after sticking it out decided to leave the trail. He is on to another adventure out West. Hike your own hike has many meanings. Im finding that when people have stumbling blocks they simply change direction. I’m staying open minded to change. We had two of our hiking friends (trail family) leave the trail because they reached their goal. We were lucky enough to catch up to a couple of our trail friends we lost when we took 3 zeros in Pearisburg. We hiked with them for two days. Those were two of the most memorable days of this hike. We hiked with Dawdles, Chewy and a new friend Charzard who is the coolest 21 year old young man. We called ourselves family. Stacy and I, the Nana’s. Dawdles and Chewy, Ma and Pa. Charzard the son. It is amazing how close you get to friends in a short period of time, we had a blast at camp playing bean boozeled and telling trail confessions. We had a great night at Spy rock watching the sun set. We hiked our butts off up a mountain that took all day to end the night with the game and lots of laughs. I feel like we bring out the best in each other. We ate lunch today at a street while we waited for our shuttle to the hotel. They stayed until we left and it was an emotional fare well until next time. We are returning home for two days. We will eventually catch up because the trail tends to happen that way. They take a zero, we hike a long day. We cross paths over and over with trail friends. It’s a very unique experience. This section of the trail has been very enjoyable. We have seen more deer, I have lost count. We had one visit us for a while at camp. The flowers have been pretty and I have learned to identify jewel weed which stops the spread of poison ivy and sooths the rash. The smells of the flowers are indescribably. Most exciting have been the fire flies that are actually in the beetle family. There dance of lights are actually the males way to find a mate and they do a light dance with each other. Fire flies are super interesting and create a fairy land feel. When we return to the trail we will be entering the Shenandoah National Park. I am looking forward to this section. The trail will be there when we return. I am super excited about seeing my family and friends. I can’t wait to see Amanda and share my positive experiences that I have had. My hope is that I can pass on a message that she can do what ever she wants. I’ll also get to cuddle Cam for two nights as we will be staying with Dawn and family. I’m also looking forward to driving to a coffee shop or grocery store to get fresh food when ever I feel like it. Hiking tid bits: CHAFING. A losing battle with moisture and friction that caused chafing in very uncomfortable and unmentionable areas of the body. Powder, ointment and products with vasaline are helpful for treatment but prevention is difficult as moisture is hard to avoid. What is the solution, grin and bear it!","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596270,"The Shenandoah National Park is beautiful. My new favorite. It smells beautiful through-out, berries, wild flowers and sporadic pine sections. It’s like aromatherapy all day. The terrain is so much easier than what we are used to and  most the trail is rock free. I’m loving it! Plus there is more access to food, camp stores and waysides almost every day. Then there are the bears. We have seen a bear everyday for four days straight. It’s totally crazy. I mostly feel at peace hiking the Shenandoah. The sunlight shines down on the forrest in a magical way.I was wrong about the rocks but still my favorite, I have fallen in love with the Shenandoahs. I feel so happy and alive in this park. It truly is a spiritual haven. Today’s hike brought this beautiful smell for miles. I can’t even begin to describe it. I’m not sure what plant, flower or fern is responsible but I’m on a mission to find out. I have discovered a beautiful smelling flower similar to lilacs called Asclepias (milkweed) native to Virginia. It is everywhere which is great since us hikers smell really bad. The black berries are everywhere. We only steal a few every once in a while as it is the bears food and we don’t share our food with the bears. The mom and her cubs where the last bears we have seen, ending our 5 day streak. In that day alone we saw 6 bears. Although it was scary to witness the mama bear in protective mode it was interesting. When it comes to our children, us mamas are nothing to be messed with. As a result of the crazy amount of  blackberries, there are so many blackberry treats. We had the famous blackberry shakes at the waysides which were to die for. The best was the blackberry cobbler, I swear it has been the best dessert I have ever had in my entire life. Stacy’s homemade blackberry ice cream was not so bad either. What made the dessert more interesting was the Shenandoah Valley Cloggers that preformed in the next room. It is something so unique and cool that I couldn’t break away. Similar to tap dancing but with a different flair. Again, made some tentative plans, some of which have worked out and others not.  I have given up with spending to much time planning. I find it more enjoyable and peaceful letting the trail lead me. My higher power has better plans for me every time! Hikers tid-bits: Look before you pee. There could be a snake learking about, possibly a rattle or copperhead, both of which can be life threatening. As I witnessed, fleeing from the snake could also be dangerous when falling over from fright. There could also be poison ivy, which take it from our friend is very uncomfortable on the tushy.","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597551,"West Virginia and Maryland although short miles in each state had their own beauty. West Virginia makes up 4 miles and was emersed in civil war history. 
Coming out of Harpers Ferry W.V. was a wide path making for a nice stroll with wine berries on both sides. You could smell the berries aroma for at least a mile. I picked my share and maybe too much as I encountered some stinging nettles which immediately showed up in the form of rashes on my legs. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be and subsided quickly (2hours) but now I know what stinging nettles look like. 
The most memorable time in W.V. occurred right before entering Maryland when a fawn came hopping in the woods, running circles around the trees as his/her mama watched in the distance. It reminded me of Cam with his energy and I could imagine the mama thinking of allowing her baby to run off that energy before nap time. 
Maryland had a similar feel with its young forrest and the civil war historical sites, as well as the many walnut trees. The two camps we set up in this state had us surrounded by Walnut trees making for interesting night time walnut showers. Surprisingly no walnuts hit our hammocks but I was often awoken through the night with thoughts of hoping the noise was just the walnuts. We spotted a lot of burnt orange colored baby toads that leaped through the trail. It was the first time I saw two butterflies attached together, which I believe were in the act of mating. Moving on to Pennsylvania (aka Rocksylvania) say a prayer we make it through the rock scramble.","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598503,"The first day in Pennsylvania we saw a bear, a baby rattle snake, a black rattle snake and a deer. I was very excited to tell Stacy there was a dog walking towards us only to stop her from passing me when I thought it odd that there was no owner and no jingling of a collar; well that was because it was a bear. The black rattle snake had us trapped for 15 minutes until Stacy could muster up the nerve to pass it on the trail, of course at a safe distance. 
The southern section of P.A. was beautiful. We walked through miles of cornfields, crops and pastures. There were a number of state parks with picnic tables, restrooms and spigot. One of the parks had a beautiful lake and a concession stand with soda and snacks. We spent 3 1/2 hours there enjoying the lake and food. It was a great break in the middle of a hot day. 
We enjoyed the easy terrain hiking through lush woods. We saw two fawns chasing each other and another fawn that raced across the trail about 3 feet infront of me with mom crossing up ahead. 
We stopped at a restaurant/hostel the Doyle for a quick bite in Duncannon and had a great time chatting with the owner. She was a spitfire from Mississippi who called me a Yankee like three times. Once was when I didn’t know what a hush puppy was. Hush puppies are fried balls of cornbread. The story is that while the catfish was being fried the leftover coating of cornbread would float to the top in the oil and that was given to the puppies that were crying for some of the food. They would scoop this left over cornbread often in a ball and give it to the pups saying “hush puppy.” They are delicious! We spotted a lot of hawks in this area. Apparently there are lots of hawks as a trail leads to “hawk rock” a lookout. Of course we found the ice cream before heading back on the trail. In these parts they call hard ice cream, hand dipped. Weird! 
The northern section, well all I can say is ROCKS! We saw our first raccoon during the day, not a good sign but it climbs the tree and we hiked on. Knifes Edge was very cool, not as difficult as I thought but the rain had subsided and the sun came out long enough to dry the rock clusters before we reached them. The rain, what can I say, rain and rocks do not mix. On our last day hiking in P.A. we saw either a pheasant or quail with little babies in tow. It was very cute and they scooted off into the ferns when we approached, which made me wonder are these ferns loaded with creatures. 
If anything P.A. has taught me to be patient, to challenge myself, and to accept my shortcomings. It was challenging to make it through the wet rocky areas with an injured foot but I did it. The biggest lesson “this too shall pass”. It ended with a lot of gratitude for a sunny day. 
Hiking tid-bits: look up information about berries before eating, they may kill you. We don’t know of anyone who has done so but it is tempting.","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599057,"New Jersey is one of my favorite sections. It held so many good memories and hiking through a second time brought them all back to me.
 I love the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge which is a beautiful walk around marshland with all types of birds. We spent some time talking with two bird watchers who were trying to spot a rare bird to the area. We watched a Swan and her babies cuddle up. My favorite part of the refuge are the trees, they are gorgeous. There is one tree that I found in 2015 and when I saw it again I was speechless. I have been told it is a London Plane which is a hybrid of a Sycamore. 
The Swamp River boardwalk is an almost mile walk along a boardwalk built around a swamp with fields of wildflowers and surrounded by the Mountain View’s. The end of the boardwalk is a country store that serves ice cream and apple cidar donuts. 
The Secret Shelter is this man’s farmland that he allows hikers to use. It has a water spigot, a shower and these cute little cabins. We met the man the first time and he was there again. This time he took us over to feed the donkeys. We made a truce with the donkeys that chased Barkley the first time we visited in 2015. 
New Jersey is easy terrain but beautiful. The deer are everywhere and I have had long moments with them. Sometimes they are interested in you and other times they look up then go back to eating the berries. The berries.... huckleberries are everywhere, not as yummy as blueberries but still good. There are large areas of these beautiful trees that are white in color with smooth bark. There are a lot of bogs so we saw a lot of frogs and on land there were a lot of tiny toads. Hiker tid-bit: chewy says “don’t fall down when no ones around”, because it’s funnier if there is a witness.","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600045,"The beginning of N.Y. started hard with rock climbs which were fun but time consuming. We met our first family hikers. A mom (drip dry) and her sons 14 y.o. Scout and 10 y.o. Clumsy. I love this family and I can’t wait to see their pictures of Katahdin. 
The Lemon squeeze a rocky section that is a tight squeeze, was the end to the rocky climbs. We had a nice surprise that morning when (Penguin) our friend that we hiked with for many miles at the beginning, came down the trail. It was a great moment that made my day.
I was looking forward to bear mountain as I have good memories of the area. We had section hiked this area with my best friend Alecia. I had thought the mountain difficult but was surprised by the ease. The best part of Bear Mountain was seeing (Chewy) our trail friend. We hadn’t seen him for many weeks. He stayed with us and the next day we took a zero (no hiking) day to celebrate his birthday. It was a great two days. 
New York was not quite as I remembered it but it is a beautiful state. What stands out are the many tiny toads that were leaping along the path and lots of mushrooms. We saw our first Buck and two in one day. Rock climbing , cool rock ledges and the Lemon squeeze make New York a state to remember. 
Hiker tid-bits: sour cream chips plus flour tortilla equals emergency lunch. High calories are needed to hike these miles so don’t run out of food.","

Nana Troll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602680,"New Hampshire has been the most incredible experience on the trail, it is absolutely breath taking. Franconia Notch and Mount Hight have the most amazing vistas. We hiked 11 miles above tree line (Alpine zone) with mountains surrounding us and the next mountain to climb in view ahead. It is impossible to capture in a picture or to describe my feelings while hiking the Whites. Mount Washington and the surrounding Presidential Range were within those 11 miles. 
I have gained confidence in myself in the Evergreen Conifer forrest with its steep ascents and descents, rock climbing and rugged terrain. Mountain after high mountain (3000-6000 elevation) the perserverence and work put in to make it to the peaks was a challenge but a testament of character.  
The continual thousand foot elevation climbs has tested my reserve and the views at the peaks have humbled me. 
New Hampshire has a magical Christmas feel with its narrow winding trails that are lined with fragrant evergreens and sparkly mica glistening in the sun rays. The forest is a strong and powerful place that will make you struggle to see its beauty but once you get a glance you crave more. It was a perfect balance of perseverance and a glorious reward.","
