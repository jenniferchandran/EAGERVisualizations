TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588889,"Like many of you who hike, I'm kinda jumping off of a ledge here. I worked at a consumer goods company for the past 4 years. In a lot of ways, I loved it. In a some ways, I didn't.  They offered me an opportunity to leave in May and I took it.  It feels good to make a move like this, but the one thing that makes me nervous is the same thing that has always made me nervous: I have no idea what is next.
That thought, combined with my admiration for the outdoors, and for those that dedicate themselves to exploring and enjoying it, bring me to my first ever thru-hike. I planned to reach out to close friends to see if they'd like to join. I explained my decision and emotions to my parents. They've always been a bit perplexed by my decisions to just jump into a new thing like this and they took this decision better than I'd thought they would. Completely unexpectedly, my mother called me two days later asking if she could join, to which I immediately said ""Fuck Yes.""
So now I am thru hiking the Appalachian Trail with my mom. I have additional hopes beyond exploring self and nature; I hope to expand and explore my relationship with my mom.  I understand there will be stress and anger and fear between us a points of this journey, but I also know that there will be laughter and love and trust. In my mind, there is no more unique and lasting way for us to develop this relationship than to embark on the unknown together, trials and tribulations be damned.
Looking forward to more journals.

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588921,"Tomorrow is my last day of work.  This has been my only job since leaving college and I've worked hard over the last 4 years to learn, make friends, and to grow as a person.  People know me, I know my way around, and I now understand our business well enough to figure things out.  The idea of leaving this comfort that I've worked so hard to attain makes me a little bit nervous for a few reasons.1. I grew up during the Great Recession.  My dad was out of work for 2 straight years after his employer of 20+ years dissolved.  He has actively advised me against following my desires to chase work sabbaticals and breaks, quoting his own father, ""It is always easier to find a job when you have one"". To counteract this engrained fear, I have to keep reminding myself of another quote, this one from my high school friend, Ashwin, ""You gotta risk it for the biscuit"".2. As I understand it, the true romance of the trail lies in foresight and in hindsight. This leaves a 5 month gap where I'll have to actively seek this romance past my more immediate concerns of hunger, cold, wetness, and discomfort. From what I've read, it will be difficult. And exciting.3. It sucks to rebuild; I'm going to have to rebuild when I move at the end of the trail.  This is something that I learned when I moved to college, when I moved to Appleton, WI for work, and when I moved to Rogers, AR for work. The first 6 months of reaching out to make friends is really tough on you.  It saps energy and resolve.  That said, it also allows you to reset and grow. Examining my own experiences, it is always 100% worth it.I understand that this journey is worth it. And I believe that my current levels of nerves are normal and healthy.  I can do this and I am excited to this.  I just can't forget that.-Abacus",,View Entry,"May 03, Thu",0
TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590636,"Enabled by my current unemployment, I spent a long weekend in Bemidji, MN with my high school best friend, Shelby. In prep, I've already pulled together most of a pack and added some additional weight to simulate whatever I am missing. I'm currently towing around 33-35 lbs and I'm hoping that I don't end up much heavier than this.We spent a short day (~5 hrs) in Itasca State Park, hiking 10 or 11 miles. The hike was absolutely beautiful and it brought me back a bit to hiking in Michigan and Wisconsin.  There weren't any fabulous vistas or peaks to climb, but the entire hike was pretty: massive red and white pines and birch trees with light green leaves from first bloom that would at time break apart to offer glimpses of small ponds, apparently called sloughs by 'Sotans. These sloughs, though I'd never seen them before, just looked like a post card of 'Up North'. I could just imagine a bear or herd of deer peeking out of the woods for a drink.We didn't see much mammalian wildlife but I think that I doubled my lifetime bald eagle sightings in a single day and I also saw my first loon. The entire experience has my anticipation building for June 4th.",,View Entry,"May 15, Tue",0
TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592414,"I’ve officially been unemployed for 25 days.  I’ve spent this time semi-positively: taking up running again, prepping for my hike, hanging out with best friends that I wouldn’t see in a while, and trying some new things out in my personal presentation, namely getting my first tattoo and bleaching my hair for the first time (successfully, anyways).  I appreciate this time and did a decent job using it to grow.

That said, there are a few relatively undefined goals that I didn’t meet.  These are activities that I always told myself that I wanted to do but didn’t because I was too busy or I expended too much of my brain power at work.  These are things that I want to invest in to grow myself and expand my boundaries: writing poetry, writing in this journal, learning an instrument from Sai/Maria, and learning a few new dance moves.  These are activities that are more difficult in the short term, but that have a massive long term internal and external benefit.  They are also activities that I have not invested in, yet again.

This is all pretty typical for me.  It gives me a bit more to think about and reproves something that I already know about myself: I still don’t know how to spend my free time in a healthy, constructive way. I need to build a structure or routine for myself that makes me pursue these activities in the short term long enough that that become what I enjoy.  This will be something that I will focus on on the trail, writing at a consistent time in the day, and hopefully building successful habits that will follow me off the trail.",,View Entry,"May 30, Wed",0
TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592704,"Countdown continues… 2 days!
Sharon and I spent the last few days getting our gear wholly together and making some tough decisions on what to bring (expect a gear post in the next few days).  Now that we had our packs together, our next step was to do a dry run to see how well we were prepared. We chose Pinckney State Recreation Area as our hike, planning to do 12-13 miles on Thursday, camping overnight, then finishing with 5-6 miles the next day.  This is only ~40 mins from our house and has a good amount of ups and downs, which are essential for training and difficult to find in Michigan.

We set our with our packs, mine at 36 lbs and Sharon’s at 29 lbs, and our trekking poles. Sidebar: I had never used trekking poles before, believing that they were nerdy and unnecessary, but I can tell you that I immediately felt a massive improvement both up and downhill. I was able to move way faster in both situations while putting less strain on my knees.

Anyways, this area is full of mostly deciduous trees, oaks and maples, with pretty heavy undergrowth. Recent rain ensured that a plethora of ponds were completely full with water and algae, bringing both a smell and unbearable hordes of mosquitos throughout the park.  It was a sunny day; it was also 80+ degrees with high humidity. These temperature factors ensured that we were constantly coated in a sheen of fresh sweat, rejecting and evidently overpowering our chosen mosquito repellent, picaridin.

As a result, we were swarmed the entire time that we were in the park. I can say that I have never seen nor been attacked by so many mosquitos in my life.  There were easily fifty hovering and trying to land on the two of us at any point.  Our reaction was spraying more repellent, swatting, swearing, and speeding up, none of which had the intended effect.  We rushed through our 12 miles in a little under 5 hours, setting up camp and immediately seeking shelter in our tent. With their physical assault hindered by the tent, the mosquitos began a psychological assault, hovering near our heads and toes in case we were foolish enough to touch the thin barrier between our species.  We fell asleep before sundown to the high-pitched buzz of their wings.

These mosquitos were terrible; they were the worst I’ve experienced in my life.  That said, we did learn a few things on this trip:

Through Google, I’ve learned that Picaridin is effective, but that in the face of large swarms, nothing can stop mosquitos
We need to further research bears.  We had a lot of discussion with no informed conclusion on how far away we can spit toothpaste, hang the bear bag, wash our dishes, etc
We can manage the weight that we are carrying and we are in shape to start this journey
Despite the miserable mosquitos, we still enjoyed the hike and are as ready as we can be for Monday
If you get too many mosquito bites, it looks like you have chicken pox (see pic above)

So… despite all of the negative, this was still a constructive trip.  More to come!",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Sat",0
TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592966,"I've backpacked for a few days on the AT before, in Georgia in December with my friends, Garrett (Bowie) and Stephen (Saint). I've also backpacked in Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Colorado, car camped all over the place, and taken weeklong road trips along the west coast. None of this prepared me for the rigor that we put into our gear list for the full Appalachian Trail.To give some immediate scope into the degree of ounce counting that thru hikers go through, many of the websites that my mom and I perused advised that to cut the handle of your toothbrush in half, as you only really need half of it. As the saying goes ""ounces make pounds"" and we need to minimize pounds. A lot of my prior gear was cheaper, heavier, and not designed for Ultralight backpacking, meaning that I actually rebought multiple large items that I previously owned. After AT prep, I now personally own 5 sleeping bags and 3 tents.I gotta give some big shouts out to Kimberly-Clark. The Excel skills that I gained doing complex financial modeling helped my mom and I add up our pack weight before I even moved back to Michigan (shouts out in particular to the SUMIFS function - luv u bae). We individually weighed each of the items that we intended to add to our packs and then cross examined each other on our desired gear. ""Do we really need that big knife?"", my mom asked. ""I know you're a nurse but I think we can cut our med kit weight"", I challenged. We both soul-searched for an answer to the question, ""how many pairs of underwear do I really need?""(2 is the answer).All in all, we bought 2 new sleeping bags, a new tent, a new pack for momma, and several non-cotton clothing pieces (my personal fear of nipple protrusion be damned), each of these decisions requiring their own hours-long research period. We landed at a decent starting 'base weight', weight before food and water, of 40 lbs between the two of us, costing us around $1,400 in new gear.  Adding food and water will likely be another 30-35 lbs, depending on our expected time before restocking. As we hit the trail and learn more about what we use and do not use, this will likely come down.
As an aside - I'm just learning that people can't comment on these journals. This is a bit disappointing, but there is a Guest Book option if you do want to leave a comment. I'll be checking and responding on here or feel free to text me or my mom and I'll get back to you when I have service.
Thanks all for the support so far - we should summit Mt Katahdin, the northerly AT terminus tomorrow (6/5).",,View Entry,"Jun 04, Mon",0

We arrived in Bangor around 10am on Monday. After doing some quick re-research, we rediscovered that we needed to take a bus from Bangor to Midway and that this bus only picked up at 6:30pm. 8 hours to kill in Bangor, ME... We picked up a few things from the local outfitter, looked around an antique shop, and walked to a few museums that ended up being closed. This left us with few options on a rainy, cold day. We ended up both picking up a book at the Bangor Public Library and reading there until the local brewery opened up.
When we arrived at the AT Lodge, we immediately met a few different people. Julie (Hummingbird), Giovanni (Mantra), and Nick.  We also met Ole Man, the owner of the Lodge, and Trash Panda, who worked for him. These two natives told us everything that we needed to know about Mt Katahdin and the northern parts of the AT. The next 8 days for us include bouldering up Mt Katahdin a few thousand feet and the well known '100-mile Wilderness'. Because I am writing this after the fact, I can immediately talk about Katahdin.This mountain was described to us as one of the most difficult ascents of the trail. It felt nearly vertical at some points and was constantly up hill. Much of the 5 mile trek was actual bouldering, scrambling up rocks while using cracks and rebar as handholds. On top of this, the temperature was 45 degrees at the bottom and around 35 degrees at the top with misty rain the whole way.When we got past all of the rocks, we reached the Tabletop, which is a plateau on top of the mountain with very foreign scenery. Lichen and moss dominated the flat landscape with leopard green and black rocks jutting out. It felt like magic and there were a few places that looked ripe for ritual sacrifice. We did reach the peak and had an equally difficult descent from the mountain.  Our total mileage was 10 miles, but because the peak is the beginning of the trail, only 5 of these actually counted.Following this, we hung out with a few of our new friends, including Brian (Backdraft), who met at the peak. We slept a 9 hours and woke up to hike to the 100-mile wilderness.The 100-mile wilderness is the longest period of time on the trail without any restocking, access roads, or towns. We are walking in with 7 days of food, averaging 1.5 pounds a day. We need to average 14 miles of hiking a day in order to avoid running out of food on this part of the journey. It is said that this 100 miles and the White Mountains in southern Maine/New Hampshire are the most difficult parts of the trail. That said, the scenery is beautiful: lush mossy undergrowth and pine needles with plenty of beautiful freshwater streams.I'm currently writing this from Rainbow Ledges, two miles after Hurd Lean-To. We are 6 miles into the 100-mile wilderness and looking good. I still don't have a trail name, but I do have a few ideas. There is minimal service here so we stopped to take advantage. I will post the next time we can and definitely when we get to Monson, ME, the next town.","Katahdin Streams Campground

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594400,"Same deal as before - I couldnt post all of these pics that I wanted to in here so here is the link to my IG post:
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk...
We officially survived the 100 Mile Wilderness. I haven't actually posted anything in here for a week due to lack of service and a reprioritization. Over the last 7ish days since my update, I've met ~15-20 people from all over the country, peaked 6 or 7 mountains, and developed an equal amount of blisters. The people have been weird, but the terrain has been weirder. We hiked 115 miles in 9 days up and down steep rocky climbs, through bogs and marshes, and through pine needle-covered forest floor. It's been mostly good weather, sunny and 70 degrees, with some heat and some heavy rain sprinkled in. It has been a blast.
My mom and I have stayed together, meeting people and hiking around and with them for a few days at a time. We currently have a trail family (tramily) with two or three other people (Oli, Hummingbird, Mantra) and we've been enjoying their company a great deal. It is insane how quickly you can make new friends out here. 24 hours of hang out time adds to a steep mutual understanding of potential friendship if consecutive.  We've been named officially, which is honestly really easy - you just start telling people what your name is. I've been going as Slim, on account of my bleached hair and Detroit-ish origins. Sharon has been Mama Goat - an homage to her most prominent role and her persistence and determination on the trail.
Like I said above, the terrain has been absolutely insane (pic above). Ole Man, at the AT Lodge said that the tree roots in Maine / New Hampshire are like someone threw a bowl of spaghetti on the trail. This was the best picture of that I could take, showing a particularly treacherous uphill climb of root on top of slick slate.  Some of the NOBOs that we've talked to have said that this terrain is some of the hardest on the trail - it definitely beats up your feet and slows you down.
As for our food situation, I met a man named One Step, who told us that he always had a policy that you should leave the trail for town with no more than two raisons and a Slim Jim. At an estimate of 1.5-2 lbs per day, food quickly becomes heavy and over carrying is to be avoided. Mama Goat and I had planned in this way already, and actually needed to get a few more food items from some friends who'd overpacked to make it through.
Overall, this trail has been much more difficult than expected. We've been making it through by supporting each other and working with out new found friends to keep the whole thing fun. We are in the Great Outdoors, which is sometimes easier than it should be to forget. That said, a quick glance around and a deep inhalation is all it takes to appreciate what we are able to do here.
I'm going to end this entry with a stanza of a poem that was quoted to us by the owner of Shaw's Hiker Hostel, Poet, as he dropped us off to resume our trip after a night in town (I think I'm going to do a write up on that place too). Our group asked him to repeat it and we've taken a liking to it so far. Many more days and nights and poems to come - Happy Trails!

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595190,"Since my last post, our small group has travelled from Monson, ME another 60 miles through Caratunk, Stratton, and over the Kennebec River. We are currently sleeping at the Spaulding Mountain Lean-to and plan to resupply and shower for the first time in a week in Rangeley in two days. Our group has added another member, a fresh undergraduate named Lightweight due to his ability to stretch the boundaries of comfort and avoid carrying some of the comforts considered essential by other hikers. I still haven't fully figured him out but most notably, he did not bring pants or a sleeping pad and seems to pack light on food and run out before we make it to town. He's been good company for the past three days.
Last post, I left it pretty vague around Monson and hostels and I wanted to clarify what we ran into. My understanding is that the hostel that we stayed at, Shaw's Hiker Hostel, is top of the line. So as you look to understand an average hostel, understand that this explanation will likely be balanced in the future by one that leaves me feeling equal and opposite emotionally down the road.Because hikers are travelling both North and South, it is pretty easy to get tips on upcoming towns and terrain along the path from people who have recently marched through it from NOBOs. We also do our best to do our part as SOBOs for them. We had previously been advised by literally everyone that we ran into that we needed to stay at Shaw's in Monson. Apparently they had good resupply, a gear store, nice bedding for all, and a primo, monster, all-you-can-eat blueberry pancake breakfast. After eating Clif bars and Knorr rice for 9 days, this was a must.So we planned our trip around these pancakes. We were expecting massive storms from 5-9am and then all day, but needed to get to breakfast by 7am for pancakes. The night before leaving the 100 Mile Wilderness behind and arriving in Monson, we stayed around 3 miles from the trail in a lean-to, figuring that this would give us a first chance to test our waterproof gear while being able to dry off at the hostel all day afterward. We set alarms for 4:10a, barely before sunrise in June in Maine, and went to sleep dreaming of pancake mountains and syrup waterfalls.A few hundred yards in to our morning hike, the down pour began.  We pushed through, fueled by our goal and our reward on the other side. After a half hour, the trail became muddy and slippery, leading to a few near falls. Sheets of rain were partially slowed down and collected into larger drops by the foliage above. My own cheapass REI raincoat was completely compromised and rendered useless. It did not stop until we finished our three miles, around an hour and a half of Soaking. We arrived at the road, threw our packs into a covered truck, and ducked inside our prearranged shuttle with thanks.Our driver worked for Shaw's and ended up not giving us the pre-planned tour. He let us put our stuff down in one of the bedrooms and then led us one by one into the kitchen. This was ~The Moment~. We walked into the kitchen soaked through and miserable. We were cold and hungry but hopeful. The instant warmth of the griddles and smell of onion and garlic potatoes in every way met our expectations and desires. It was like breaking into a bubble; everything changed all at once. As one of the first people to walk into this room, I was able to see this same change come across the faces of my friends one by one: misery replaced by giddiness. They brought our eggs, bacon, and potatoes out to us, followed by unlimited blueberry pancakes. I let myself down by only eating 5 of the flapjacks, but left feeling satiated and full.After dinner, I took my first shower in 9 days and did my best to use up all of the hot water myself.  Stepping out of the shower, I had an uncontrollable grin on my face and actually started laughing a bit out of pure joy. Clean and full; it's the little things.Following clean up, we took a tour of the property. The hostel was actually comprised of two full two-story houses, each with a detached garage. One of these houses and garages were used entirely to store tired hiker bodies overnight and had both private and bunk-style rooms. The other garage was used as a resupply and gear shop, another source of income for the family. Mama Goat and I made use of their expansive hiking knowledge, asking a few questions about our various blisters, scratches, and injuries. Their advice led us to purchase even more equipment, a monetary payment for the help. The second house was used as an actual home for the owners, Poet and Hippie Chick, and their two kids and dog. The yard space in between the two houses was used for tenting space for hikers. Two hired hands worked full time to serve hikers, take care of the kids, and maintain the space.Monson is a town of one Main street that holds the 4 or 5 small businesses that make up downtown. We hung around this town for the rest of the day, enjoying the few restaurants and beers that the town had to offer then went to bed satisfied.","

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596021,"UpdateWe finally exited Maine yesterday on July 1st. It was 281 mile in one of the most beautiful states I've spent time in. It took us 25 to get through all of those miles, giving us an average mileage per day of 11 miles, a bit lower than my original goal. That said, I've talked to a lot of discouraged NOBOs recently who have said that southern Maine is the single most challenging section of the entire trail. The second most challenging is the New Hampshire White Mountains, which we are starting tomorrow. These whole sections feature strep granite inclines above tree line, making them precarious with rain or wind.I've fallen more in the last three days than the entire rest of my time out here. I'm still with Hummingbird, Olli, and Lightweight, though we are splitting up soon due to differences in speed. I've been meeting hella other people too, which is the focus of this post. Ive been building up a lot of photos, so I also threw just a few random pictures in an Instagram post available here:https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk...
The PeopleOne thing that I wondered about before starting this is the type of person that it takes to do a thru hike. There seems to be a high variety of people: many ages, past occupations, and reasons for doing the hike. That said, if you try to boil it up a bit, it seems like most people are in transition. Many of the people that I've talked to are in between jobs, whether moving location or starting a new vocation, they do seem to be looking for something out here. This strikes me as a very rational way to handle transition.I was talking to the owners of the Hiker Hut, an off-the-grid hostel outside of Rangeley, ME, and they had an interesting perspective. The owner, Steve, has spent more than 20 winters in India running a non-profit to help improve access to healthcare. In India, it is very common to go on a pilgrimage. This is an accepted part of the culture and and a large percentage of the population takes an introspective journey at some point in their life. This is true in Thailand as well; Hummingbird spent 2 years in Thailand and has told me that when the king of Thailand died, the entire country entered a period of mourning. Many people journeyed to the capital to bid farewell and mourn en masse, taking weeks off of work. Paul said that a thru hike is the closest things that us hard-working, results-oriented Americans have to this. We are continuing in the tradition of American naturalists Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. He related that he considers himself a key part of this pilgrimage, helping people experience something new and scope-broadening. This is what binds the people of the trail. As far as I've seen, we are all trying to help each other do this.Personality-wise, I'd say that there are a few specific people-types: the Yogis, the Rabbits, the College Grads, the Retirees. Yogis are typically younger, chill, in it for the enjoyment, and, as the name implies, they talk about wanting to do yoga a lot (and then do it pretty infrequently). They are extremely friendly and often mention Buddha and how beautiful all the trees are. The Rabbits are not talkers unless met at a shelter overnight. They are the NOBOs who made it to the front of the NOBO pack by speeding through 25-40 miles a day down in easier terrain. They're almost always sweating and a grunt is a full, hospitable greeting to them. College Grads are probably the most diverse group. They have recently finished either undergrad or grad school, have different interests, and are in it for the social environment. Finally, the Retirees are usually section hikers, allowing for time in between long hikes to recover. They've often been doing the AT for many years; the most I've heard is over 20 years, and they are using their additional time to complete their journeys. They can be very inspiring to talk to. This sums up most of them, but there are obviously plenty of characters out here. On a less ethereal and more tangible note, I've listed a few of the wonderful people that I've met below to give a few anecdotes.
Slim (Me) - worked in finance for a Consumer Packaged Good company, took a voluntary severance, not sure what is nextOlli - just finished grad school at UNC for a degree in Public Health, not sure what is nextHummingbird - Did the Peace Corp in Thailand, then a year with an Americorps group, not sure what is nextLightweight - just earned his bachelor's in Civil Engineering, plans to work for a nuclear submarine manufacturerMantra - worked in IT for an insurance company, not sure what is nextNon-Stick - was a teacher, planning to teach in Thailand again after this hikeFluffy - worked in IT as an entrepreneur, not sure what is nextMush (and Zara) - took a year off from undergrad,  switching to a new school after the summerBackdraft - was a teacher, not sure what is nextUltrarunner - was an EMT, took off a year to train here and run 200 mile races (she crazy)Dandelion - was a teacher in New York, quit and not sure what is next","

The New Hampshire White Mountains seem to be a highlight of the Appalachian Trail to all who pass through. Their difficulty, grandeur, and popularity are emphasized heavily. I can now confirm these reports as true myself. The White National Forest hosts 80ish miles of the Appalachian Trail and these are some of the first miles that SOBO hikers go through in New Hampshire. They are true mountain ranges, featuring many related peaks and, from these peaks, a lightening gradient of blue mountains as far as the eye can see in any direction. The AT here is essentially broken into 2-3 day hikes by highways that allow access to towns. These highways are in sharply descending valleys that are called 'notches' by New Englanders. Therefore, each section is usually explained by stating the names of the notches on both sides or the names of the predominent mountains in the section. All of this is National Forest land that is mostly managed by the AMC, Appalachian Mountain Club.The AMC is absolutely notorious on the Appalachian Trail and is sometimes referred to as the Appalachian Money Club. I had an extremely negative perception of them well before entering their lands. I've mentioned Poet, the owner of Shaw's Hiker Hostel in previous posts - he told me that in Maine, it feels like the AT belongs to you and that in New Hampshire, it feels like it belongs to the AMC. The AMC limits the amount of free, impromptu camping that you can do, forcing previously carefree hikers to plan their routes and stick to those plans. They charge for the use of their campsites and shelters, as far as I know, this is the only place that this is true on the entire AT. They also charge large fines for violating their rules and I heard horror stories of hikers awoken at 3am while camping in a 'no camping zone' only to be delivered a $125 fine. All of this gave my little group such a drastic impression that we would hate the AMC that we decided to hate them ahead of time, cursing their name at the first sign of bad blazing or poorly maintained trails. I will come back to this later.Because we are going south, we first arrived in Gorham, NH and chose to stay at a hostel that offered free slackpacking. Olli, Lightweight, and I slackpacked from Pinkham Notch to Carter Notch over the Wildcat mountains, which was 21 miles in a single day. Before doing this, I had no idea what slackpacking was; apparently, you can leave the majority of your pack at the hostel and borrow a daypack to increase your speed significantly. It was a sweltering 90 degrees and sunny, but we flew over the miles, hiking up 4,000 feet over 3 miles at 2 mph pace. It was incredible; I was completely unperturbed by my usual ankle and knee pain. Following this incline, the forest opened up into the top of a ski hill and we took a break at a picnic table next to the lift. We proceeded along a few peaks, marvelling at the mountain ranges surrounding us. This was our first glimpse of what the White Mountains had to offer and we were running up and down constant 55+ degree granite slopes, taking it all in. This has to have been my favorite day so far. Because we were slackpacking, we were quickly picked up by our friendly hostel owner, Paul, as soon as we were ready. We spent a comfortable night in the hostel and woke up the next day on the 4th of July.Gorham, NH is apparently the July 4th capital of New Hampshire, drawing hundreds to this small vacation town to watch the largest fireworks display in the state. We had planned our trip  to hit this spectacle and I excited to see what July 4th in New Hampshire was like. I won't go into detail here, but I found out that it is pretty much the same. The only differences were the size of the display (weakass, NH) and the people that I was with. My 4th on the trail featured hang time with people from all over the country and of all different ages and backgrounds - shouts out especially to Allison, who drove in from Portland to hang (From the Yellow Mountains to the White!)The next day, we set off from Pinkham Notch; next up in the Whites was Mt Washington and the Presidential Range. It was sunny and over 90 degrees with thunderstorms and extremely high winds expected later in the night - a family member would later text me with worry after seeing an ariticle about heat stroke in the Whites this weekend. It was sweaty and difficult making it up and over the first peak, Madison. We started in a rocky New Hampshire forest that opened up into an Alpine zone, devoid of most vegetation besides blue and green lichen and sparse but hardy flowers. This zone was made up of small boulders ranging in size from house cat to rhinoceros and was in direct sunlight. This terrain eventually solidified into the mountain from which this fallen rock zone developed. There, we peaked Madison as intermittent shadow was cast by passing clouds, dripping with sweat from the tollsome trip.We continued, passing Lincoln's jutting towers of boulder and Adams's cresting pyramid of rocks. Mt Washington, the 2nd highest point in the Trail and home of the self-renowned 'worst weather in the world', was just ahead. On the way to the top, we climbed across the railroad tracks of the $51/per person steam train, in which there was not a seat unoccupied. It was well-known on the trail that this was a huge tourist trap, featuring an Extreme Weather Museum, a small food court, and access via automobile or train. It does, in fact, have extremely high winds and unseasonable temperatures at times, leading to hypothermic deaths even in the middle of July.  Though our destination was designated a State Park and it was a part of the Presidential Range, the few questions that we got upon reaching the top we're pretty basic. ""You hiked up here?"", I was asked by several incredulous tourists. ""Yes"", I replied, without mentioning hiking the 350 miles from Maine to get there. This was a definite deviation from our usual company of dirty thru hikers. We took a standard picture at the top and ached our way down to the Lake of the Clouds hut around 6:30p.These huts are well built buildings with full facilities, including a full kitchen, lavatories, and bunkrooms. Weekend hikers pay $120 to stay there a night, which includes two freshly cooked meals and a bed. I had heard mixed reviews from other thru hikers about these huts but found them to be an attempt to support thru hikers. Thru hikers could Work for Stay there, putting in 30-120 mins of light labor in exchange for leftover dinner and sleeping space on the floor. Though this sounds like a pittance, many thru hikers consider this a luxury and had taken to 'hut hopping' to stay at all of them.At Lake of the Clouds, we found a previous acquaintance, Boston, along with several new ones that I had only heard of in journal entries and through word of mouth: 1k, Oolong, and Trash Panda. 1k was a notable new friend, as I had met his mother randomly in the Wildcats and she had encouraged me to make his acquaintance. We asked the hut managers for Work for Stay and also asked what that was. Essentially, we only had to wait around for a while and do a small chore in the morning to have access to a lasagna dinner, egg and oatmeal breakfast, and the spacious dining room floor to sleep on. Due to the fast approaching storm, we considered this a no brainer and signed up.Olli, Lightweight, and I spent the rest of the night and the morning hanging out with our new friends, reading, and watching the weather. All night long, high winds and rain battered against the firmly built hut and lightning and thunder shocked us awake. We awoke around 5a to the clatter of dishes and to the paying guests shuffling around the dining room like zombies. Our morning chore turned out to be quite easy - folding blankets and sweeping out bunkrooms. After this and the life-changing quality of free food, we were ready to set put. But Mama Nature wasn't ready for us yet. A constant drizzle, 50-70 mph winds, 10-20 ft visibility, and 40 degree temperatures had us locked down. The weather slowly calmed enough for myself, Oolong, and Lightweight to set out around 10:30a, still being too rough for the others.My goal was to get to Mizpah Hut, 6 miles out, to reevaluate the day. When I walked outside, it was not raining, but we were in the middle of a cloud. I could see 10 ft out into the thick fog and the high wind was battling to push me off of my feet. At one point, the sky opened up and began to hail on me, rocketing sharp hail against my bare legs at 60 mph. I had never seen weather like this before. My entire body was soaked through and I was walking with puddles in my shoes. I had to keep checking to ensure that my pack cover was still on and that my hat wasn't going to fall off. I eventually struggled my way to treeline and immediately felt relief from the wind. It was a slick 3 miles still to Mizpah and but the time I completed that, the sun was starting to show through the clouds a bit, breaking up the plague of fog. I got some free leftover breakfast from this hut and moved on. My plan with Lightweight was to stealth camp at the next notch, Crawford Notch and wait for Olli to catch up the next day. We found a campsite right next to the road and passed out pretty promptly. The next day, we went back and forth on whether to wait for Olli. This is a pretty common dilemma on the trail. If you don't wait for someone after a delay, you'll end up walking a day ahead or behind them. After a lot of discussion, we decided to wait for him, taking an easy 8 mile day to the next hut, Zealand, and working for stay there.We started late and walked slowly, which was a very new sensation. We were still passing day hikers, but going a comfortable pace to the first lean-to 3 miles in. There, we took a break to eat and nap in the sun. This was followed by another 3 mile hike and another nap next to Thoreau Falls. Thoreau Falls were pretty pretty. They were comprised of a granite decline that wove down like a waterslide into a larger pool around 100 ft below. I had a goal starting this trip to write and sketch frequently. Ive been doing decently in writing, but hadn't sketched at all. I tried to draw a boulder and the flow of water at the top of the waterfall, but it was completely unintelligible. Some things just aren't meant to be. We continued on to Zealand Hut, which sits upon a waterfall. We arrived right at 4p and were immediately granted work for stay. Guests here were very friendly and ready to learn more about the thru hiker lifestyle. 8p turkey dinner and another snooze on the dining room floor ensued.I'm going to hold here because this play by play is much longer than I had originally anticipated. I'll keep writing and post more in the next few days!","

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600036,"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm...It has been a LONG time since I posted one of these. The last thing that I posted was about my first half of the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Since then, I've walked through the end of New Hampshire, Vermont, and as of yesterday, Massachusetts. I also left for home for 8 for my cousin's wedding (congrats, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks!). I will now be through Connecticut in 2 days.As I've gone South, the sharp boulders and rocks of Maine  and New Hampshire is slowly giving way to rolling hills, dirt paths, and farmland. As a result, the miles have been coming much easier; I've been averaging 18ish on days that I hike fully. After my trip home, I've found myself more towards the middle of the SOBO pack and have made many new friends and have met back up with many old ones. The wonderful weather that I had been walking through has been replaced by either aggressive, sweeping thunderstorms or high heat and humidity depending on the hour. Water is either avoided and cursed or chased and sought after. I am now on my second pair of shoes, my first having exhausted themselves through 600+ miles of the roughest terrain of the AT. This new pair lost their sheen immediately in the 6 inch deep mud of a 2 day rainstorm in Vermont. I've been gifted with trail magic like crazy: free blueberries, burgers, beers, and breakfast.I write this on Mount Sharon, at a campsite in CT. Hopefully this post will get me back into the groove of writing. Know that I am doing well and I will be writing more soon.","

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600457,"IG for all pics: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm...Update: I am now in New York, posting from a wet tent a little bit past Pawling, NY. I'm with Olli and three new friends that we met last week: Spork, Two Shoes, and Two Socks. These three new dudes are between 22 and 24 and have some primo funny banter going between the three of them. It has been a riot getting to know them over the last week and we are going to stay at a relative of Spork's tomorrow night. 
------
In downtown Rutland, VT there is a 24/5 cafe that sings of the Shire. Decor is heavy wood, brick, and twine, held together by large nails and tanned animal hides. The walls are handpainted with murals, depicting birds and the Appalachian Trail. Light lute music dances in the air and the smell of tea and fresh baked goods wafts along with it. All of the male workers have trimmed beards and short ponytails; women keep tight buns and wear brown tunics over floorlength patterned dresses. All of the workers' names were not only Biblical, but also Jewish and very old fashioned. The menu was 4 pages, hand drawn and photocopied. I'm sure that I would love this cafe if I lived in Rutland.
As a thru-hiker, I was there for a different reason. We had been hearing about this place from many of the NOBOs that we had run into. People had excitedly been talking about a cult further down the trail: The Twelve Tribes. Based on my limited pre-reading, The Twelve Tribes is an apocalyptic Christian group that runs farms and delis or cafes in countries all over the world. They follow the Bible, live communally, and try to get back to how things were in the time of Jesus, or as they say, Yahweh. In the last 40 years, they have spread from Chattanooga, TN to all over the world, in over 40 sites.  In Rutland, VT, they run a deli and a hostel for hikers. They also have community housing for their members and a farm where they produce much of the food that is used by both the deli and their community. They also have a farm in Marshall, MI (FYI for all my Day Ones).
Olli, Boston, and I rolled up in a hitch hiked Toyota SUV around noon. Yonaton checked us in and showed us around. The hostel was full enough that we would need to stay on the third floor, though it was still under construction. They were currently prepping for the NOBO bubble, when a lot of the Northbounders would walk through at the same time, so they were working like crazy to get this floor up and running. There was a buzzsaw going when were dropping our stuff off, ran by two brothers with mini ponytails around 13 and 10 years old and their father, also with a chopped ponytail. We felt a little out of place, having missed the memo on this style.
We headed over to Price Chopper and refilled on food and then headed to a nearby bar for drinks and dinner. We had little contact with any community members during this time, though we did add a fourth roommate named Southboundjon. He had hiked the AT in 2016 and was now attending to the Long Trail, which intersects with the AT for a few hundred miles. That night, I woke up to hammering at 11:30p. I wanted to stay in bed, but my curiosity and hopefulness to see some creepy cult shit got me out of bed to pee. The hammer sound was coming from that same 13-year old boy, still working on the siding of the new room upstairs. We made eye contact briefly and then I moved on with my night.
The Twelve Tribes are currently involved in multiple lawsuits, including one in Rutland, about child labor. The state claims that these children are working illegally and should be zoned out in front of the TV like true patriots, while the Tribes say that they are volunteers and are just helping their community (apparently through 12 hour work shifts). I never got to ask this boy any questions on his motivation, be it internal or external, corporeal or emotional. He looked pretty curious about who I was, but that is all that I know.
The next day, we ran our second slackpacking adventure, this time over Mt Killington. We were equipped with light day packs, a rainbow cheetah print one for me and a unicorn one for Olli, which were provided by the Tribes. Looking real good, we hopped off the bus and began our 18 mile hike. I had previously been in conta-ct with the Koswicks, who own a place in Killington and therefore frequent the mountain. We had a generous offer (I'll call it trail magic) from them to reimburse us for Bloody Mary's at the Lodge on top of the mountain, so we had plenty to look forward to. Just like last time, slackpacking was pure magic. I always seem to forget how much I love hiking without a massive pack in my back. Hiking our way to the top of Mt Killington, we went inside to find that the bar was closed - no Bloodies for us. We took a few pictures at the peak and had a snack there anyways.
On our way down, the Nate Austin-built playlist (shous ou!) that I was listening to colored the sun speckled trees a more melancholy, meaningful color. By the time we finished these 18 miles, we were pretty tired and sore, but nowhere near as much as usual. I thought about it for a to while, then pulled an admittedly very Dudek move - I asked Olli to take my bag back for me on the shuttle and ran 7 more miles back to the Yellow Deli in downtown Rutland. My joints, unused to the hard concrete, ached during these few miles but I was proud of the decision. Once back, I got dinner with friends, paid for by Southboundjon, and hit the hay without talking to any other community members.
I awoke early enough the next day to volunteer with breakfast and performed multiple tasks for the other hikers: buttering toast, setting tables, and pouring water and maté, the signature tea of the deli. Following breakfast, I stepped a bit out of my comfort zone to volunteer to go to their farm for the entire day. I had previously determined that I had an extra day and had been a bit disappointed in my limited interaction with the Deli. I had recently been pretty into communal living and was hoping to walk away with a better understanding of how it works for them. This was my opportunity. 
6 other people signed up with me, prompting our guide, Aysh, to load us onto their minibus for transport. We had a good two hour car ride to get acquainted. I immediately hated one of my companions. Tom was a non-hiker who was staying at the hostel during hard times. He had a way of over delivering everything that he had to say and of singing when entirely unnecessary. The third song that he tried to get the bus to sing together was 'Wheels on the Bus', if that says anything. My irritation preoccupied me and we were suddenly at the farm.
Stepping off of the bus and into the sunny, 80 degree day was a moment. The farm was sprawling to me but relatively small as far as farms go, only 40-50 acres of farmed land. There was a house and multiple barns on the hill where I stood, overlooking the farm at the base. Large locust trees and a canopy over a few picnic tables provided shade on this upper lawn. Sunhats were distributed and we were given a tour of the facilities. The farm consisted of a small greenhouse full of tomatoes and herbs, a section for vegetables, and a third of the farm reserved for wheat. The head farmer, Lamuel explained to us his methodology and thought process in planting and his technique for attempting to selectively breed various plants. He had been farming for 30+ years, most of which were on this farm.
He then set us up weeding the echinacea plants, which are harvestable only after three years. I accidentally killed a few of the plants after they explained this, driving additional guilt into my thoughts as I buried the slaughtered flowers secretively. Following this, we paused for a maté, quinoa, and fresh vegetable lunch, which was one of the most healthy I've had since starting the trail.
After lunch, things got interesting. Myself, Tom, and a Grad student named Sumo were left to speak directly to Lamuel. We asked him various questions about the community and his relationship to it. He, in a story that rang similar to many other members, was at one point heavily into drugs. He grew his own pot, the start of his farming career, and was one of the very few people to successfully petition and then sue the federal government for a conscientious objection discharge from the military. He seemed to loath the division between church and state, a position held by many members.  He attacked me for my previous role at a CPG company in finance and then congratulated me for leaving. From this thought onward, he went on a long soliloquy, repeating many typical complaints about cell phone use along with many strikes at the individualism and consumerism that is encouraged in American society. He rang true to me when he attacked this individualism, as this was why I was interested in communal living in the first place. His speech ended when he somehow got on the topic of race and stated that he believe that black people were better off having been taken as slaves to America than left in Africa. Both myself and Sumo interrupted him, only to be interrupted by Tom, changing the subject. I later chastised myself for not coming back to that.
This racism is another frequent criticism of the Twelve Tribes. A few old sermons from 1991 and 1998 seem to echo this line of thought:
“What a marvelous opportunity that blacks could be brought over here to be slaves so that they could be found worthy of the nations,” read a second sermon. “A good master would work by the sweat of his brow. If his slaves were lazy and disrespectful, he would beat them, which is what he was supposed to do.”
https://www.thedailybeast.com/twelve-tribes-the-church-preached-child-abuse-and-slavery
They have been called out for their racist beliefs in the past and a quick Google search will add more context for you, should you desire it. I should say that one of the 7 of us volunteers was black and the community was equally polite and open to all of us. They also have black members who have spoken against these allegations. All that I can report is what I saw and heard myself.
We continued on with our weeding, moving to onions after lunch and I finally had a few minutes alone with a younger member whose name I can't recall. I questioned how he joined the group and tiptoed along subsequent questions, nervous to scare him off. The day's heat bore down on us as we talked, narrowing my vision from sweat and light. He explained how he joined the group, running through a story of drugs and wasted time and lack of direction that was familiar from the pamphlets that the Twelve Tribes had made for handout and the story that I had gotten from Lamuel. We were interrupted at one point when Tom shed his shirt and was scolded for being 'indecent'. Apparently this was not allowed in front of their women.
I pressed my contact for more information, asking about their hair and their fiscal decision-making process. Their mutual hair style arose from a desire to eliminate vanity from the group. I appreciated the way that he explained this - their strange custom had arisen from a simple attempt to move closer to their values. As for how they choose investments across their sites, countries, and 3,000 - 4,000 members, I didn't get a lot of information. He explained a bit on how they share their farmed products globally, giving Vermont access to Maté from Brazil, honey from Canada, and olive oil from Spain. He also mentioned a specific time a female millionaire made the leap into their group while wandering the beach. Her fortune was invested in a few capital expenditures across the world, including a new farmhouse in Vermont. I still don't have a sense for how reliant they are on recruitment for money vs their shops, but they definitely weren't hurting for cash.
I thoroughly enjoyed this conversation and when it was time to end it, he asked me for my email address. I gave it over to him, thinking that I could just ask him to stop emailing me if I wanted to. Right after giving this to him, I nonchalantly outed myself as gay. A look if surprise registered on him as I walked away - I still haven't received an email from them.
After this final section of weeding, it was time to go. We were all given the option to stay for their Spiritual Gathering and dinner. Four of us, including myself and Tom, took them up on this. We had some free time to check out the barn, pick raspberries, and go for a swim in the river. Inside the barn, we were given the opportunity to milk a goat, which I jumped on. I felt a little bit bad for the creature as I worked to get the awkward motion down, but I did succeed in getting a few weak sprays out of her. After this, I washed up and went after the raspberries. Ripe berries rested on 5 rows of bushes. These were the most delicious I have ever had, outshining even the wild ones from the trail. After this, myself, Tom, and one other guy walked down to the river. A mother relaxed in a camp chair while her two sons played in the water. I asked her if I could take off my shirt and she said that she didn't mind, so I stripped down and jumped in. She soon left and the other two dudes joined me in the water. We swam for a bit, then walked back up when we grew tired of it.
Finally we were ready for the spiritual gathering. We headed up through the woods to the top of a nearby hill, finding a few houses and cars. Continuing our elevation gain, we came to a small hexagonal wooden pavilion lined with 30 or 40 chairs, all facing inwards. They were slowly being filled by community members sitting in their respective family units. Some I recognized from the farm, but most were new faces. A cello, violin, and acoustic guitar were brought out and the nightly event was called to order. One woman sang a single line alone and after a brief pause, both instruments and the chorus of the entire group started in on the song. A few members stepped into the center of the circle and began to do a group dance, holding hands and rotating as a circle and pausing to double clap with the music. They continued in this way through the length of the song, adding new people from the audience as they felt like jumping in. The song ended and the dancers stepped back into their places. This pattern continued for 5 or 6 more songs, which was probably 4 or 5 too many, and then the congregation sat down.
One of the older members opened up his personal Bible and began reading from it. This part was less like a sermon and more like a Dharma talk, from Zen Buddhism. The speaker discussed a few lines about words being either medicine or swords and how we could all improve on using this power well. Other members of the church sprang in to add their personal thoughts, mostly just repeating what he said while adding surprisingly little personal experience. The discussion continued, and somehow the speaker managed to throw in a few strange comments, including another criticism of the separation between church and state and a defense of calling Native Americans by the name 'Indians' because they migrated from Asia anyways. The discussion was ended by a group prayer for success in a trial that was taking place the next day regarding their usage of child labor.
Dinner followed this final thought: pasta and salad with sauces made from their farm. I had three plates and ignored much of the conversation, worn out from all of my previous investigative journalism.
It was a 2 hour car ride home and then I left the next day to ponder this experience on the trail.
All in all, the Yellow Deli was much less dramatic than I had hoped. They did seem like people who were truly trying to live to their defined values and standards - this impressed me. Unfortunately, many of their values are old fashioned and seemed to be exclusionary, making them in direct conflict with many of the values that my millennial ass holds dear. One cannot argue with the stability of their commune and the main question that I left battling with was whether religion was necessary to hold that community together. To me, a commune held without the supervision or promise of a God power would be even more impressive and might be a place that I'd want to check out.
Feel free to do your own research on the deli, up to and including actual visits - they seem to be in pretty much every state. It was definitely scope-broadening and trope-shattering: something that we all need some more of.","

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600628,"IG link wit all pics: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm...I am writing this from a tent on Black Mountain. In an overly optimistic display of hubris, our group of four has elected to all avoid using our rain flies tonight. This is in the face of rain storms every other day and most nights.  We are risking ourselves in a defensive move against heat and humidity and also for a chance to watch the Perseid Meteor Shower from our tents.  It has been going on for almost a week now and this will be our first opportunity to see it due to all of the clouds and rain that we've been walking through.
I say four of us because we had a busy, sad day today. We woke up at the home of Spork's uncle. He had generously offered to let us stay at his place, giving us showers, laundry, and sleeping quarters. He also gave us beer and wine and a 4 course dinner, which made him an instant hit. He got us back to the trail in two shifts: Two Shoes, Olli, and I separate from Two Socks and Spork. We took off and did our usual talk / walk business.
A few miles in, we hit the Bear Mountain Hudson River Bridge. This is a huge, silver suspension bridge over the river near Peekskill, NY. I threw a few pics in there of the bridge, which show both Olli and Two Shoes. After crossing the bridge, we immediately turned into the Trailside Zoo, which is apparently a zoo which habitats (seemingly poorly) injured and disabled animals. This gave a huge opportunity to take some insane pictures of the almost stationary, very sad looking animals. I have added a few pictures of the bald eagle and the foxes to my IG post.
Exiting the zoo, we entered Bear Mountain State Park, a huge park with a gigantic swimming pool on a lake. Many large families were roasting burgers and hot dogs over coal fires, so we stopped here to eat our lunch as well.
I haven't really talked a lot about my new friends yet, so here I'll run the gambit.Olli and I have been hiking together on and off for two months. He is gay (I'm not the only one) and graduated with a degree in Public Health in May. He and I get along pretty well and have had some really good conversations that have made me rethink some of my relationships and my relationship with myself.
Olli, Hummingbird and met Two Shoes, Two Socks, and Spork together and our groups instantly connected. After a light day with swimming and a bit of drinking on a lake island, we became fast friends. This new group of three has absolutely terrific banter and can riff like no other. They often times play words games off of inside jokes, connecting similar sounding words, adding accents, and performing almost mini impromptu skits. They are more on their feet than I've ever seen and seem to communicate as well as any improv group I've seen. I've loved my time with them so far.
Unfortunately, Two Shoes was only here temporarily. He is heading back to California to substitute teach and today was his last day. He had a friend meet us at the park and we said our goodbyes.
After goodbye, the four of us continued on, moving our way up Bear Mountain and covering 2.5 miles in 45 minutes. We were completely soaked through with sweat by the time we reached the top. In fact, we were completely soaked with sweat pretty much the entire rest of the day, as the sun beat down on us and the humidity choked our breath. At some point though out the day, we ran into my first real Timber Rattler, also pictured on IG. Soon after this animal sighting, we arrived to the granite outcroppings of Black Mountain. Upon discussion, we decided to cut our day short to try to use this vantage point to see the Meteor shower, bringing us to our current resting place.Our group of 4 will likely be breaking up a bit in the next few days, but I will plan to meet up with them again as soon as I can.
Thanks to all who are still reading and sorry for the potentially poor organization of this post. Apparently you can actually sign your email up on here somehow to get updates when I post. FYI for anyone who wants it.","

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601591,"To the IG: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn...I am writing this while be serenading By Magnolia and Trash Pockets, two thru hikers going South. I had previously met them at Chet's Hostel in Lincoln, NH but did not know that they had this talent. At the time, they had 3 dogs: one friendly and two relatively unfriendly. The two of them seemed pretty anti-social, a man and woman in their very early twenties. I ran back into them at this shelter, Eagle Nest and gave them cookies. Just before we went to sleep, they offered to play us a song and revealed suddenly their tremendous talent, apparently developed through busking in trail towns up and down the AT. We thanked them and said goodbye forever in the trail way. I felt like they'd given us a gift as they walked away - worth much more than a few cookies.Over the past week, Ive spent a few days off trail and reunited with some friends. We are currently just past Port Clinton, PA and will hit 1,000 mf'n miles tomorrow. A few highlights from the past few weeks.Myself, Olli, and Two Socks all worked together to bust our daily hiking PRs with a 30 mile day. We started at 6:30a, timed our breaks throughout the day, and hiked until well after dark - around 9p. It was rough and my feet killed afterward, but it was definitely doable and we all discussed throwing one of those in a week to try to speed up a bit.I stayed for two days with the Angel(a) Reviello and the family. Angel was in her home state of PA for a Kimberly-Clark recruiting trip and took the time to pick Olli and I up from the trail. We spent two days hanging out, eating phenomenal Italian food, and swimming in the pool. I got to see Angel's childhood home and meet many of the family's friends It was honestly really hard to leave. It kinda messed with my head a bit to see so many people that I knew going on with their lives while I'm on hiatus on the trail. I know that the time is for me, but this is hard to keep in mind.When we got back to the trail, Olli and I almost immediately met back up with Spork, who had taken some time at home at the same time as us. It seems weirdly difficult to lose good friends out here. The three of us had a shelter to ourselves last night and we talked about this feeling we are getting. I tried to describe it. I am really enjoying my time out here, all of the thinking and enjoying and expanding. But there's something there. Its not like an insurmountable challenge or specific inconvenience that is bothering me or that I can't handle. It's just this feeling... I'm still out here. It feels like it has been such an insanely long time - almost three months - and I'm still out here. Everyone else is moving forward in life and I'm messing around in the woods. But it isn't just standard  FOMO; Istill don't think I have the feeling perfectly. It seems to be temporary and triggered by too many days away from the trail; I already felt better today. But it is still there.On a more typical and happier note, we have been in Pennsylvania for a few days! This part of the trail was supposed to be rough as hell. It was described to us as a series of pointy fist-sized rocks: a boot graveyard. And it has not been nearly that bad. There are more rocks than other states and they are chewing up my feet, but there are also plenty of dirt patches and the terrain is distinctly lacking in elevation changes. I threw a bunch of trail horror pictures in this album to show the worst parts.
Thanks to all those still reading!","

I've enjoyed a bit of an online journaling siesta as of late and I've had a few experiences that warrant some air time. I am writing this from Brown Mountain Shelter on the night of 9/24. We plan to hit Glasgow, VA tomorrow. I am with Olli, Bam Bam (formerly Two Socks), Spork, and our new friend Blueberry. I really needed to get a post up, so this one is a bit less detail than previous ones.I walked into Shenandoah National Park on September 9th. My friends from Wisconsin, Maria and Chris, came to visit on the 11th and I had previously booked a cabin in the park for us to hang out in. Besides the shelters that are typically on the AT, these cabins actually have 4 walls, bedding, and a woodfire stove. Chris and Maria are working on a new Instagram (@cozyvegancouple), so we planned to cook some good food for their blog at the cabin.On both the 9th and the 10th, SNP was completely layered in fog. Florence was expected to make landfall on the coast of the Carolinas in a few days, which would make the visibility only one of many weather-related problems. Chris and Maria arrived as expected on the 12th and after a Walmart run, we had a fully stocked cabin, including dinner, breakfast, and a thru-hiker's wet dream, a 30 rack of beer. Our guests, Two Socks (soon to be Bam Bam), Spork, and Hansel, soon arrived. Compared to our usual digs, this was a paradise.We all cracked a beer and I doled out a few duties. Chris and Maria were in charge of dinner, Two Socks was in charge of fire, Hansel got the water, and Spork and I organized the cabin. The night turned out as terrifically as dinner. The heat and smell of firewood pervaded the cabin and dried out our packs, which had been wet for a few weeks. At some point in the night, a NPS ranger pulled up in his truck. Reverting to high school, we hid our beers unnecessarily and talked to him. He explained that the park would be closing tomorrow and that all employees would be evacuated by 6pm. The previous 3 weeks of rain left the soil weakened, raising the potential for dangerous blowdowns and trapped hikers. He answered our numerous questions then left us to discuss our plans. Largely pushed by Hansel, the rest of us decided to cut the hike short. We would hike 9 miles the next day then drive up to State College for the Penn State game to avoid the hurricane. We hiked those 9 miles with Chris and Maria maintaining our pace admirably. There will still no views. We ran into a friendly park ranger, who drove us back to the car and then took off for Penn State. Once there, we spent the next three nights in The Reviello's State College condo, drinking and resting and doing laundry. We had an absolute blast and were blown away by the generosity of the Reviello's. Two more of my trail friends got to meet this family and see how incredibly hospitable they are.When Saturday came around, we attended the tailgate with them, drinking and eating all day. While drinking beers shirtless on top of the RV, I ended up running into my friend from Wisconsin, Paul, who had recently moved to State College. Through an unbelievable coincidence, he was available and willing to drive us back to Shenandoah the next day. Thank you, Paul and Lauren!We arrived back in Shenandoah to the exact same weather that we had vacated. It was 55 degrees, foggy, and raining. If you were following  the hurricane at all, you would note at this point that the hurricane stalled over the Carolinas for a few days before swerving north to Virginia. This meant that we had not avoided this hurricane at all and it was actually going to hit us the day after we returned. This absolutely destroyed our positive attitudes. We hiked 4 miles to the next shelter, a sturdy one called Byrd's Nest #3. Our friend, Trash Panda caught up to us that night and we also met two new friends, Riz and Ice Man, who were flip floppers now heading south.All 6 of us awoke the next morning to torrential downpour and trees bowed from wind. Within a few minutes of witnessing this, we made a unanimous group decision to 'zero' at the shelter and not leave for a day. Our old friend, Olli ended up hiking 4 miles from the previous shelter to meet up with us then joined our sit-in. Other friends wander through the shelter throughout the day but pushed on. This made our group feel a bit wimpy, but we all agreed that we had also made the smart decision.The storm faded by the evening and we saw our first AT sunlight in weeks. The next day was also cold and wet, but then we finally got two solid days of sun and happy vibes before dipping back into rain and wind and fog. During those two days, we relished the weather, camping on top of Bearfence Mountain and catching a sunrise and a night sky of stars.
It has felt like it has rained and been around 60 degrees for 80% of the last 3 weeks. This has been tearing into all of us pretty hard. You hike really hard up mountains for views and are rewarded by a cold, wet fog. Buckets of rain dump enough to soak through your raincoat and your pack and the high humidity and fog means that your things never dry out. Mildew is being added to our usual smell of sweat and grime. You realize quickly that you can't stop hiking to eat or rest because you'll start shivering and dipping into light hypothermia. In the last three days, I've been pretty sick as well and I got as close as I've gotten to quitting the trail. In all of this, we are pushing through together. We have a good, strong group of myself, Bam Bam, Olli, and Spork and we have enough fun and comradery to fight off the shitty weather. That said, I hope it breaks soon.","

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604651,"IG: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp...In the last few weeks, I've covered a good portion of Virginia and entered Tennessee. I hit McAfee Knob, Tinker Cliffs, and Dragonstooth, the three big spots in the state.  I left behind all of my friends and reunited with a few of them. I've been pretty beat up by the ups and downs of these mountain ridges and the rocky terrain. My ankles are yelling at me like I'm back in Pennsylvania. After a series of very consistent long mileage days, I had a 7 day trip to Asheville to recover. My partner, Hunter, came down from Wisconsin with his friend Max and we booked an Airbnb for a few days. My dude Sai hosted us for 2 more nights in his new apartment as well. I'm feeling good about the trip right now. As of tonight, I'll be staying at the famous Kincora hostel and I have only 398 miles (3 weeks!!) left.
I've been writing this post for a few weeks so I apologise if it is disorganized.
Mileage
I haven't given a full update of my mileage in a while. Ive recently upped my average mileage and it has been kinda rough. Myself, Bam Bam, and Olli planned a 31 mile day and a 27 mile day to reach a sunrise at McAfee Knob. We all completed our 31 mile day and I was the only one to complete the subsequent, consecutive 27 mile day. I arrived at dusk on Friday night and met Michael, a weekender from Western Virginia. He and I hung out and we got up early to hit the sunrise together.
Since that day, I've been hiking alone until just the last few days. I've averaged about 23 miles a day for 3 weeks, with only one short day of 9 miles. This has been putting enormous strain on my body. Virginia trail is pretty flat except for the distance on the tops of ridges, which can be extremely rocky and reminiscent of further north. My ankles and knees have been absolutely killing me as a result, though I've been able to push through.
It felt good to get these miles down but being alone has been kinda boring. This is the first time that I've ever really hiked alone for any significant amount of time. I've been relying on audiobooks, music, and day hikers for a pale imitation of my usual social interaction.
Waynesboro & V
Waynesboro is supposed to be one of the friendliest trail towns on the AT. We stayed there for two nights and confirmed this. At the time that we passed through Waynesboro, I was hiking with Spork, Bam Bam, and Olli. We had also run into another group, Panda Express, which consists of Trash Panda, Oolong, Scout, Rebound, Turmoil, and Ice Man. All of us were staying in town overnight. Panda Express was staying at a hostel and our group was cheaping out and staying for free on the lawn of the local YMCA.
We had gotten to Waynesboro early in the day and had had time for chores and to wander around a bit. Usually it is up to the thru hikers to hitch hike around town; in Waynesboro, we were stopped by two cars that asked us if we needed anything and offered us rides. This was the first time I had ever seen this on the entire trail. We spent some time at a bar downtown then headed to the YMCA in the dark. As we were walking, a car pulled over and a young woman yelled out to us. She introduced herself as V and asked us if we needed anything: food, a ride, etc. I hopefully responded that all we really needed was a place to stay. She was extremely nice and said that she just didn't have the space but that she would drive us back to the trail in the morning. I offered to buy her coffee and we took down her phone number. We were waiting at the YMCA to register to camp when she changed her mind, dropping a text on us that rippled high fives through our entire group.
We walked over to her apartment and found that she was a single woman living alone. I was shocked that she was willing to host all 4 of us bearded fellows, but she only too willing to help us out. After talking to her for a bit, she agreed to slackpack us the next day, meeting us at Dragon's Backbone Brewery for beers before saying goodbye. We would sleep in the campgrounds of the brewery for free as thru hikers. She gave us some absinthe, which I later threw up, and some food, which unfortunately joined the absinthe, and we went to bed.
The next morning, we hit coffee and headed to the trail, sad to be leaving V. She dropped us off at the trailhead and we began our mileage. I was sick and not doing well and it started to rain midday through the day. By the time that we reached the brewery, it was absolutely pouring. V was waiting there for us and offered for us to stay at her place again. Panda Express was already at the brewery and gave us the tour. They had been there since 2 pm and were quite drunk. They showed us where we would be tenting, walking us through a 6 foot wide stream to get there. The tent sites were chaos. Rainwater poured down all over them, causing a river beneath and sometimes through their tents. It felt like a war zone. I made eye contact with Spork, who had come with me to check it out, and we both knew that we were staying with V. Due to my illness, I served as DD that night so that everyone else could indulge. Our group if 11+ spent the night listening to cover bands, drinking craft beer, and talking. It was a definite highlight, ending with warmth and security in our #1 trail angel's home. V - I hope you are reading this and I thank you!
Bear Sighting
I was walking along the trail, in between McAfee Knob and Dragonstooth when I heard yelling up ahead. I sped up my pace to see what was going on. When I arrived at the commotion, I came upon a very shirtless, very muscular man who was worked up and breathless. He explained to me that he had been taking a snack break when an adolescent bear, apparently allured by the smell, wandered out of the woods almost right up to him. He had begun to yell and search for his bear mace in his pack, but the bear quickly disappeared the way it came. When this particularly fit man heard me coming down the trail, he thought that I was the bear and was ready to take me out with bear mace. I thanked him for looking first and we BS'd a bit before I continued down the trail.
I had been walking for 1,400 miles and had not had an encounter like this weekender had had. I was a little bit jealous. I mentally rehearsed what I would do if I saw a bear in a similar fashion, imagining myself yelling, throwing rocks, and if need be, drawing my trusty hiking poles into a defensive position to ward off my attacker.
Around 10 miles and 3.5 hours later, I had my opportunity for glory. About 12 feet in front of me, I heard some loud woodsy noises indicative of a large creature moving. Its footsteps made a really weird sound that I don't remember except for how weird it sounded. I halted and stared at the trail in front of me silently. An adolescent-sized bear wandered partially out of the woods and stuck his head onto the path. I didn't feel fear. Actually, as it turned it's fluffy head towards me, I thought that it was kind of cute. We stared at each other for a brief second before my miles of mental training kicked in. I threw my hands up and yelled ""Go away, bear"", sounding decidedly lamer than I had intended. The bear took no notice of my lack of cool and loped across the trail and into the woods on the other side. It was only after that I realized that I hadn't taken a picture. For this omission, a park ranger would have lauded my actions; however, as a layman and a partially active trailjournals.com user, I regret it fully. I am left counting my missing Instagram likes over and over again until my next bear sighting.
Staying with Elly and John Hoinowski
Long before I started the trail, my dad had told me about his work friend, Elly, who was building a house pretty much on the Appalachian Trail. She wanted to host me for a night of recouperation and I had thankfully agreed ahead of time. The property that they are working on is directly adjacent to the AT, right next to Kelly Knob. Elly owns the valley and the side of the mountain ridge and the AT runs along the crest. I arranged a meet up with her on VA 42, a small road near Blacksburg, where they were living while their mountain farm was bring built. Elly picked me up and took me to the farm first, where I met her husband, John, and her two dogs. I am going to skip much of the trip and spend time on the highlights and takeaways for me. 
The farmhouse looked like it was going to be terrific. It overlooks a garden where they were growing vegetables, most notably, successful  tomatoes, which John bragged about a bit. He stated that the best tasting tomatoes are the ones grown within walking distance of of the kitchen.  They also planned to grow asparagus to sell for the tax benefit and for some additional income. They are building in a condo in the basement that they could rent out as an Airbnb.
From here, we went to their cottage in Blacksburg. For those not familiar, including me until recently, Blacksburg is the home of Virginia Tech. Elly and John had originally bought this cottage to rent it out for football games or to college kids and are living in it until their farm is complete. Once there, they fed me venison bowhunted by John and tomatoes and peppers grown in their garden. John offered me dried peppers and tomatoes that they had grown then saved for later, which I graciously accepted. They told me about their recent disappointment with their mushroom hunting efforts. They are a part of a local mushroom club and have plans to open their land to the club.
All of this impressed me greatly. If you'll remember my post about the Yellow Deli, you will remember that I had a great amount of respect and works to say about their farm. Something about John and Elly's ability to create these 'side hustles', as my generation would call them, fills me with longing. These two own 40 acres of land and are partially self-sufficient, not as reliant on infrastructure as most of the people I interact with. I love this idea and hope to be able to reach for it someday. Elly, I know that you are John are reading this - thank you for opening your home to me and for all of your generosity!","

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604906,"IG: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp...The UpdateI've been walking the last couple days with Olli and Sunchaser. We've run into a group that we hadn't seen since Great Barrington, MA: Daenarys, Bedhead, and a visiting friend, Gusha. Fall has been glowing up, which is what most of my pictures are of. As for mileage, we've been averaging around 22-25 miles a day and Olli and I have a confirmed finish date of Nov 10th. My mom will be coming to pick Olli and me up, giving her a chance to see Springer and the three of us a chance to experience the southern end of the trail together. Weather has been nice during the day - 50s and 60s, but cold at night - down to mid 20s at times. Rain has become not only an inconvenience, but a real hypothermic risk given our ultralight clothing sacrifices. This has lead us to work hard to avoid getting wet, which is much easier in the late fall. We are currently avoiding the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Willa at Laughing Heart Hostel in Hot Springs, NC.
Enter the SpiritualEven before I started the trail, I heard a trail maxim that advises on the different sections of the trail: 'The first third is physical, the second is mental, and the last is spiritual'. I have 275 miles left out of 2190. My body adapted to the trail during the first two months and beyond. I've lost 5 lbs and moved muscle from my upper body to my lower body. I've had sore joints, gear failures, and blisters swollen to the size of the mountains I've climbed. Most of this happened at the beginning. During this time, I was working to get myself in the right mental spot for the trail. This has been a continual struggle, which I've talked about in previous posts. It really peaked in Shenandoah National Park, where the continual rain (the most rain ever in Virginia in fall) got me down. The rough conditions combined with the disappointment driven by living in a cloud all day and night had me as close as I've gotten to quitting.
As for the spiritual, based on the math, I've been in this spiritual zone for a month or so. I kinda feel like I've been in this zone all trail, though I do feel additional pressure to understand my motivation for starting this hike and to ensure that I get what I wanted out of this 5 month experience. So what did I want? And what did I learn?
Looking back on my journal, I was fairly clear about what I wanted. In my personal journal entry from 6/9/18, I wrote, ""As for my #1 goal out here, learning to love Alex for Alex, I'm not sure how this is going."" This goal is almost a direct quote from my therapist in Appleton; he saw my decision to take this journey as a huge step forward for me (as a side note, I want to give a shout out here - therapy has been wildly helpful for me and really recommend it to literally everyone; you don't need a diagnosis to see a therapist, it is healthy and can speed up and improve internal analysis and processing). I really do believe that I have improved in this aim, cutting myself off earlier and earlier when moving toward self-doubt and second guessing and being willing to accept failures in this and other regards as just a part of who I am. Ive been trying to improve this singular goal and to also live more in the moment. To that end, I had a recent realization that John Slabbert helped me hit on. I was hiking and miserable and wishing that I had heat and a dry roof and better food and a couch. I wanted to be all the way back home, progressing in a career or something 'real' instead of on the cold, windy trail suffering. I posted about this in my journal and John sent me a goodwill text, quoted below:
""Thanks for the 8/27 update - map has been marked up. Don’t let the zombies into your head (add the Cranberries song to your playlist). The supposed “progress” the rest of us have made in the last 3 months and might make in the next 3 months pales in comparison with the life changing personal growth, worldly perspective, lifelong friendships, and sense of accomplishment you’ll have accumulated when you put your hand on the last blaze on top of Springer. Slabs.""
One of my friends, Spork, liked this so much that I forwarded it on to him. It struck me that I was accomplishing a dream. I was hiking the MFing Appalachian Trail, something that I'd wanted to do for years. Though this was a dream, the day-to-day inconveniences overshadowed the magnamity of my journey and had me wishing I was back hom. If I was back in Appleton, I'd be wishing I was out there. This leads to a few logical questions. Will there be any time in my life that I'm not wishing I was somewhere else? What will that take?
Or is it more about how I am thinking about my circumstances? Is attitude more important than anything?
I've been told the cliches before. We can all list them: Live in the Moment, Be Happy with Who You Are, etc, etc. But it took this journey (and likely many more) start to help me internalize this. Instead of wanting to be elsewhere, I need to accept where I am at and feel it. Again, easier said than done, but hopefully I've moved just a bit more closely to internalizing that.Today, I caught up with my old manager in Arkansas, Jereme Estes. He has military experience and we started talking about marching and hiking and carrying everything you own/need on your back. When I explained this cliche and my difficulty internalizing it to him, he told me that he knew exactly what I was talking about. He called this thought authentic and told me that when I notice this contradiction and feel it, that I should sit in that feeling for as long as I can hold it. Meditate on it and (in my own words) worm it down into my psyche a little further.
On June 10th, I wrote ""True freedom is to know how little it takes to be happy."" The idea that I was working with here was that we find ourselves in luxury traps, holding onto and obsessing over avocados and lavendar soaps and central heat. I can honestly say that I've been in a happier, better mental state on the trail than I was while working in Wisconsin. The fact that this is true alone proves to me that I don't need these things and I hope that the trail will be a reference point for how little luxuries I need to be happy in the future. Something to remind me that those things can have minimal interaction with happiness if I so choose.
These are big ideas and I think that it would be easy to overemphasize and over-cliche how much I've learned. I took a few steps down a path towards a healthier, higher functioning pattern of thinking. I believe that the trail for me will function more as a reference point, something to fall back to when I am going through something difficult. I can remind myself that  I made it through the trail when I don't think that I can finish a project or make that running time or forgive that human mistake. I've lived through worse and I've made better of it. I have two weeks left of this journey. I'm going to use them to continue to think really hard on this stuff and also to think about all of the people (probably including you) that have helped me become who I am today. Thank you to all that are still reading this - hopefully my Great American (secular) Pilgrimage is helping you expand what you think you can do as well.","

TrailAl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605637,"I am writing this about three weeks after finishing the trail.

My group of ten, having met at the end of October, planned to finish on the 10th of November. We’d been cruising along pretty well, confident in ourselves and having a blast in our huge group.  The final 70 miles in Georgia spoiled us: we’re talking well-graded, flat hiking with minimal PUDs (pointless ups and downs).  Our town experiences had been enhanced dramatically by our numbers and we’d been successfully practicing our hiker skillset of squeezing too many people into hotel rooms.

We spent more time in towns than we had on the rest of trail – the only part of our hike that was not cooperating was the weather.  The wind shifted between cool fall breezes and cold blasts of wind. Nighttime temperatures collapsed on us to the low 20s, making us more nervous than ever to hike in wet conditions during the day.  Thru-hikers often don’t carry warm enough gear; heavier, bulkier clothing and sleeping bags mean a larger pack and a substantial increase in weight. I was only carrying a 40-degree sleeping back with a liner and frequently found myself shivering in the dark through both of these and every single layer that I was carrying.

Regardless of the weather, spirits were high. We were about to finish the mfkn Appalachian Trail! This was our hard-earned victory, a conclusion that we’d been envisioning for the past 2,190 miles. We laughed our way through those last couple hundred miles together. We frequently discussed our expectations for the moment that we would each touch Springer Mountain. We imagined a holy moment, a cascade of tears, an influx of winded emotion.

To emphasize this epic finale, Sunchaser and I decided to part from the group a bit.  On the morning of Nov 9th, he and I took off bright and early with the goal of hiking 30 miles in one day to finish the hike.  We pushed all day, hiking through the rain and mist and the cold wind.  The hike was pretty phenomenal; emotions peaking while battling high gusts of wind.  I did my best to think and feel during these last miles, reminiscing mostly on my beginning of the trail; Maine’s perfect days and cold lakes. It struck me how little I knew back then, not yet understanding some simple things like how to cold soak or filter water, but also not yet knowing the independence, friendliness, and dedication that I was capable of. Now, after 5 months of day hiking and night hiking and talking about hiking and dreaming about hiking, my body and mind are completely geared towards, well, hiking. Pausing in the misty rain, I wrote You don’t realize how innocent and ignorant you are of anything until you aren’t in my phone. 
The final hike rode the mountain ridge, exposing us to additional high winds and mist. We took very few rests throughout the day, only stopping for lunch and water. Around 4pm and 24 miles in, I started to hit some familiar scenery that I’d been looking forward to the entire trip.

**

In December 2012, my friends Garrett, Stephen, and I drove down from Michigan all the way to Georgia. We were in our sophomore year of college and still exploring our new freedom and ability to pursue our passions on our own. This was to be my first backpacking trip ever and Stephen, an Eagle Scout, was taking charge. We mostly used his things and were probably carrying 50+ pounds apiece. We started at Amicalola Falls and hiked a total of 28 miles in 4-5 days, 14 out and back. The strong, silent boulders stared at us as we climbed the seemingly endless ascent of Springer. I had never seen boulders like this before, lichen-covered and the size of a short school bus. We navigated mud and streams, stopping to eat at waterfalls and relishing the freedom and uniqueness of our chosen trip.

**

Sunchaser and I arrived at a cemetery in the middle of the woods. It was bounded by stone fencing and, on one side, a large pavilion.  This was as far as Garrett and Stephen and I had hiked during our 2012 section hike. I took a few moments to breathe and contemplate.  That hike 6 years ago was the true start of this journey for me. And now, 6 years later and feeling like an entirely different person, I had finished a full Appalachian Trail section hike.  I took this opportunity to joke with Sunchaser that I had completed what I’d wanted to and was going home. We took a few pictures for the crew and hit the final 6 miles down a valley and then up Springer. I should have recognized a lot of this trail but November had turned the sky dark already, forcing us to finish in the misty black.  Thick fog swirled around us, keeping us soaked through and preventing our headlamps from cutting through the night. As we climbed our final ascent of the entire 5-month journey, the ambient temperature dropped notably. It would dip to 15 to 20 degrees and windy/wet on the mountain that night.

He and I struggled up the last mile in the pitch dark. I was feeling about as miserable as I had wanted to at the end. Foot over foot, avoiding puddles and searching for the other feelings that I expected and wanted to feel. We climbed those final steps and touched that same plaque that I had touched 6 years prior while commenting on how crazy it was that people actually hiked the whole thing. In that moment, I didn’t feel triumph. I didn’t feel pride or accomplishment or an overwhelming, stormy cloud of mixed emotions. I was just cold. And I wanted to get to the shelter to warm up, eat and fall asleep.  So… we did.

I slept like shit that night. The wind was howling through the cracks in the shelter. I was wearing everything dry that I owned and I was still figuratively freezing. My wet socks, shoes, hiking clothes, and pack were literally freezing in the cold. We awoke to some light and to a woman’s voice asking some other hikers if they knew Slim. I called down from the loft to my mother. Per our prior planning, she had driven alone down from Michigan to pick me up and had arrived on the mountain for my finale.  We re-summited and met back up with our 10-person group for food and pictures.  Our celebration moved its way down to the parking lot, corks moved their way out of champagne bottles, and food made its way into our bellies.

The drive back was pretty uneventful; a surprisingly short 11 hours with Mama Goat and Olli. We got home late and passed out immediately, with Olli staying at my parent’s place in Metro Detroit.  In the morning, I showed him around my high school digs: downtown Northville, the Livonia Bates, and a few of my old running routes. He let me indulge on some of this nostalgia before I drove him back to his parent’s farm in Michigan’s thumb.

As I said before, our group had been pretty fixated on both our finish and the post-trail experience. One of our group, Gusha, had just completed his Triple Crown (AT, PCT, CDT).  He mentioned a few things that scared me a bit about coming home. Preambling that he was probably not the best person to talk to about this, he described the return home as a loss of chroma: ‘When I got home, it felt like black and white compared to the intensity and variety of color on the trail.’ He was stricken with post-trail depression, a combined and sudden wave of reduced daily endorphins/exercise, loss of trail community, and the return of the stressors of real life.

I saw this as a warning of what I could potentially fall into when I returned home. What he didn’t describe was the ease. As soon as I dropped Olli off, life was back to normal. There was no crazy transition or culture shock. As Spork noted to me via text, it was remarkably, frighteningly easy to slide back into ‘real life’.  It was like the gap that I had left was still waiting for me, unchanged and cobweb-free.  All of the thoughts and life philosophy that I had worked through on the trail now seems wistful, circling my life rather than driving it. I am now left with a few choices on what I will do now that the trail is over.  My options are as diverse and I am as indecisive as when I left.

I’ve had a bit of what I would consider post trail depression. A mounting avoidance of what I need to do and a fluctuating degree of self-critique on whether I know what I am doing. But it fortunately hasn’t been too much to work through.  I’ve found support and companionship in old friends, some of whom are in similar situations to me.
I really do not know what is next for me. This is the honest answer to the question that every single person asks me now that the trail is over. I surely learned and internalized from my time in the woods; I expect for this to help me down my path, but not to choose this path for me. Next, I will figure out what is next, reminding myself that I will figure it all out. The story that I write in my head afterward will offer an explicative narrative that will have been worth living. In the end, I at least learned that I really like backpacking, that I’m freer and more independent than I had thought, and a bit more about what living in the moment really means. I’ll catch you on the next trail.","
