Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583028,"For years we've been saying we would hike the AT ""someday"".  Well, now ""someday"" has arrived, or at least it will on April 10. And we're getting psyched. Thanks to Karen, we have a chest full of dehydrated food. The dehydrator has been running non-stop for months. We're on a first name basis with the people at our local gear shop (Outdoor Gear Exchange in Burlington, VT - the best!). We'll probably have to pay them a few more visits before we start out, but most of the gear is ready to go.We have a rather unique itinerary in mind. Last April we did a trial run from Harper's Ferry south to Skyland Resort. This year we're picking up where we left off on April 10 and hiking south for 4 weeks to Roanoke. Then we'll go back to Harper's Ferry and hike northbound to Katahdin. The we'll return to Roanoke for the final leg southbound to Springer Mountain. This way we hope to use the weather to our advantage without having to rush to get to Katahdin before it closes. Looking forward to April 10!",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Sat",0
Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583033,I was never much for using trekking poles. I hiked the Long Trail in Vermont (275 miles) in 2004 without them. I could never really understand how they might be helpful. It seemed like just something else to carry.Last year my wife and I decided we'd hike the AT in 2018 and she wanted to try out trekking poles. She did some research and came across Pacer Poles. I decided to give them a try as well. From the very first hike I was hooked!The Pacer Pole difference: the hand grips are set at a 45 degree angle to the shaft of the pole. This works out to be an amazingly ergonomic approach. Pacer Poles are only available from England on-line. Here's the link:http://www.pacerpole.com/The guy who makes them is a bit over-the-top. But the product is great.Dana,,View Entry,"Feb 17, Sat",0
Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583922,"I'm surrounded by anticipation; my entire focus is wrapped up in the journey. We say it will begin on April 10th, but really, we are already in the midst of phase 0 – the pre-journey phase.
Last month we went to Kennedy Space Center. Their freeze-dried food looked a lot like ours... Many of the exhibits focused on the years of planning that went into the flights, the sheer volume of details that had to be identified and then courses of action decided upon and implemented. On a much smaller level, that's where we're at.

First there was the spark, the idea, and finally the fully stated goal of hiking the AT. That process took years as our daughters grew into adulthood, our careers matured and then ended, and although our bodies aged our resolve hardened. We moved from someday …, to after we retire…, to next year…, to next month.

Next month!

At the space center it'd be time to move the rocket on its crawler to the launch pad.  In Vermont, we're entering our final count down as well.  Make, dehydrate, and package 120 lunches and dinners – nearly done. Major gear upgrades (warmer sleeping bag, synthetic jackets instead of down) - done. Increasing training weight to 35 pound packs – done. Find a housemate for my mother – done. Put the gym membership on hold starting April 10th –done. Even our flight to Virginia is booked. Now the list includes scheduling goodbye occasions with friends and family, packaging all that food into its drop boxes, and cleaning out my office for the house mate. We are getting down to the wire.

I'm anxious and excited to move onto Phase 1 – the first four southbound weeks from Charlottesville to Roanoke, VA. What parts of the planning will prove successful:  will our training prove sufficient; will we like the food; will our gear prove adequate for the weather we encounter; what challenges will we face and how will we overcome them; what will we modify for phases 2 and beyond; can we really do this? Well, let's get out there and find out!

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584036,"As we were planning our hike, this was the big question: what direction to hike in. We didn't want to be caught up in the big April NoBo crowd and we wanted to have the weather work in our favor as much as possible. And, last year we hiked 100 miles south from Harper's Ferry as a trial run and we don't fell compelled to repeat those miles. So, here's the bizarre itinerary we came up with.Apr 11 - Start at Skyland Resort (where we left off last year)Apr 11- May 7 - SoBo for four weeks to RoanokeMay 8 - Return to Harper's FerryMay 11 - Aug 25 - NoBo to KatahdinAug 30 - Return to RoanokeAug 30 - SoBo to SpringerWith this, we hike in the south when its cool (spring and fall) and in the north when its warm (summer).

The mutton complaint from a troll in The Hobbit has part of our family lexicon.  Anything that goes on for days, like the snow we've been having this week, is fair game for a blimey, as in snow yesterday, snow today, and blimey…  And although I'm okay with an habitual breakfast and lunch, I don't want blimey dinners on the trail.

We are not big fans of commercially available trail dinners, this one's too spicy, that one too salty, and all of them too expensive. So I began cooking, dehydrating, and packaging our food the first week in January. I figure we'll be eating around 130 dinners in the woods, and set my goal for 120, giving us some leeway for unexpected nights on the town. I finished them this week!

What did I make? Recipes that are stew-ish so they rehydrate easily.  Here is the list: 
Barley Casserole
Beef Barley Stew
Beef Curry

It's less easy to say where our AT story began. We've suggested so many wild schemes to each other over the years, laughed about them, and then put them aside, forgotten. Why this one? How did we go from an absurd chuckle to a burgeoning reality?

That very night in Max's room a forest grew and grew- and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world all around and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through night and day and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are.  
In our minds the forest grew and grew- and grew. Until we knew we had to hike it. So we've sailed in and out of our careers, through weeks of gear, food, and physical preparation, and will continue through today's upcoming flight to Charlottesville, VA, to where our hike will begin tomorrow morning.

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587151,"This week we eased our way gently into the AT. Starting at Skyland Resort in the Shenandoah National Park (SNP), we stayed 2 nights at campgrounds before tenting at shelters the rest of the week. The weather was chilly at first, then three beautiful days before rain, wind and COLD by weeks end. We started to get routines down for arrival in camp, cooking meals, breaking camp and hiking. So we're off to a good start. Now we're in Waynesboro, VA for a day off the trail (or in trail lingo a ZERO meaning zero miles hiked today).
Of course it wasn't all sweetness and light. For example, one night we chose to stay in our tent instead of joining the crowd in a nearly full shelter. The sky was threatening rain all day and just after we pitched the tent, it carried through on the threat - BIG TIME. The tent held up well as it rained hard all night. But, how to pee in the middle of the night in the pouring rain. Ellipsis (Karen) came up with an idea. We stripped naked, dashed out into the rain, did our business (quickly!) then got back inside and toweled off. We were soon snug and dry in our sleeping bags again. And more comfortable. Now, we couldn't have done THAT while sleeping in a full shelter!
Lessons learned so far:
Its much more fun to hike in good weather than in bad (surprise!)The AT in SNP is much, much nicer. Its drier and far less rugged. We learned (or relearned this) immediately after stepping over the boundary yesterday.The landscape around us is gorgeous, even in lousy weather.The people we've met so far, on and off the trail, are amazing: friendly and helpful. A shout out to Mrs. Mercier, the lady at the Waynesboro Visitor Center who gave us a ride into town).
So, a successful conclusion to week 1.
Week 2 looks more challenging, as we continue to ease our way into the AT.

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587845,"News travels up and down the trail in the 5-second to 5-minute conversations you have when passing other hikers. Yesterday's was vaguely ominous: ""Looks like the bad weather is coming sooner than predicted,"" and ""stay dry tomorrow."" After 5 dry days, weather patterns were shifting.  There are 2 road crossings that lead to Buena Vista (pronounced B-you-na Vista according to our ride...). We'd planned on hiking to the farther one, but when we approached Route 60 and checked weather.com, we changed our mind.  Here's the forecast for today:  Rain. Cloudy, with a high near 50. east wind 20-26 mph with gusts as high as 44 mph. Chance of precipitation is 100%. New rainfall amounts between 2 and 3 inches possible. So here we are, at the Budget Inn, dry and warm, letting the hills get the fill of the chilly wet water.We're starting to get the rhythm down. This week we increased our daily hiking distance - 2 days were at 14+ miles, nearly up to our intended 15 mile average; we climbed our first 4000' peak, the Priest; we hung our food bags from trees, as we seem to have left the bear poles back in the Shenandoah National Park (and no bears got them, so either we did it correctly, or the bears were elsewhere...); we slept in a shelter instead of the tent (too cold!); and camped along the trail rather than a shelter site to better manage the distance we wanted to travel each day.We've been through some beautiful, magical places. Around one bend was a hillside covered with blooming trillium leading down to a clear-flowing creek and a comfortable rock for sitting and taking it in. Another night we camped in a meadow, watching the sun set, later the moon set, and then listening to the morning spring birdsong as the sun rose again.We ran into our own trail magic at Seeley Woodworth shelter where we stopped for lunch. Little Feat's fingernails were getting all nicked up and he was tending them with the nail clippers. ""What I really need,"" he thought, "" is some hand lotion to finish the job."" He looked up and there, on a shelter beam was a small tube, just waiting for him!More to come...","

Everything smells like dirty socks at best, and we won’t go into the worst... Friday night enclosed in the tent was bad, but last night in the open air of a shelter was no better. I can’t blame it on Little Feat. We both stink. We’ve tried to stay clean. We wash and change into camp clothes st the end of the day. We use hand sanitizer and baby wipes. But we’re hiking and sweating for hours each day. And our stream wash ups don’t have soap, nor a nice long hot soak. But here we are at the Wattstull Inn - which had warm running water, soap and even shampoo, not to mention a real bed. It’d be heaven if only they had laundry within walking distance, but alas...So I think we’ll be moving on instead of taking a zero tomorrow, looking to smell better in Dalesville.More to come ..,","

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588785,"We’ve passed the 200 mile mark and are getting the routine down. Everything has its place in the backpack. Chores have a set pattern. I find it important to be compulsive about the routine, as it saves time and angst. For example, our food is sorted into 5 green odor-barrier bags, breakfasts in one, snacks in another... The bags close with small yellow tabs. I’m tired of searching for those *!&&** tags, so now, when I open a bag, in goes the tab. And it only comes out when it’s time to close up the bag. Compulsive? Yes. And stress-free (well, freer).We’ve been more flexible with our plans. We postponed our zero day to get to Dalesville, where the HoJos right off the trail has laundry. Ah, clean clothes again...Monday night we arrived at our intended shelter which, it soon became apparent, was going to be very full with an ebullient crowd.  We stayed for a longish break before heading down the trail a couple miles to a tent site where we slept to the sounds of a nearby stream instead.A fire closed the trail south of here, so we’ve been batting around our options. But our zero day has given the forest service time to put out the fire (hats off to the forest service, you rock!), so we’re back on the trail tomorrow.We are enjoying a lazy afternoon.  Laundry is done, gear aired and dry, green food bags resupplied, and naps seem like the perfect activity.Week 4 will get us to Newport VA, where our niece and nephew Sara and Keith will meet us.

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589200,"We got up at our typical 6:30 am.  The windy night meant that there was no dew. Our clothes were dry and we could pack up the tent without hanging it up.  The windy night meant that a fine layer of grit covered everything in the tent. We packed it all up, had breakfast, and were on the trail at 8:07.  It promised to be a hot day, so we each carried 2 liters of water (4 pounds - water is heavy), with hydration tablets dissolved in it.  A short (0.7 miles), steep (560') uphill brought us to McAfee Knob, for our iconic AT picture.  The overcast sky added a cool dimension to the vista. The black flies encouraged us to hike on.
The sun came out as we hiked down Catawba mountain. We passed a lot of day hikers hiking up to the knob.  Nice easy hiking. Three miles down brought us to the recent fires. The undergrowth was burned to our left, and intact to our right. The trail acted as a fire break. We stopped, chatted, and thanked the fire fighters still monitoring smoldering patches. We stopped for a snack at Johns Spring Shelter, just beyond the range of the fire.  My shoulder had been aching for most of the morning, so I took a couple Advil. It being hot, we checked our water. I was down to 1/2 a liter, but Guthook, our electronic map, indicated that there was waster one mile ahead at VA311, so we decided not to fill up at the shelter - save ourselves from carrying the extra 4 pounds for another mile. 
The easy downhill ended at the road crossing - and while there was a trickle of water in the parking lot, it was nothing we wanted to drink, and there was no water source. Hmm...  The next water was 6 miles ahead, too far to go in the heat without refilling. Hike back a mile to Johns Spring?  Hitch the mile down into Catawba? No good options. But, trail magic will happen. Two women were just coming down the trail to their car, and they filled us up. 2.5 liters apiece.  We were good to go.
My shoulder pain and the heat increased as we hiked up out of 311. The hiking was up and down over a series of knobs. Our pace was slow - we'd been hiking for 4 hours, but had only come about 4 miles. But we only had 6 miles to go, so no worries. We stopped at the top of one knob for lunch and a shoulder break. I took one of my mega pain pills. We ate our traditional peanut butter and hummus - this week on pretzels, but opted to skip the day's beef jerky - just couldn't face it it the heat. Dark chocolate M&Ms completed the meal and on we went. We started meeting NoBo's informing us of more trail magic ahead - ice cream sundaes. That perked us up. Unfortunately I couldn't go more than 30 minutes without stopping and dropping my pack for a shoulder break. Out pace was slow. What was the problem? Perhaps it was unbalanced - I swapped my water and tent poles - to put the extra weight on the other shoulder.  It didn't help. The heat increased, but we had our magic water to keep us going. Up and down we went.  A final downhill walk through a meadow, complete with cows hanging out in the shade brought us to VA785. Coming up were a group of NoBo's who held their poles up as an arch for us to walk through. But they brought sad news. The ice-cream was gone.
We stopped beside a brook for a Clif Bar snack instead, and headed up the final hill. One mile to go. I dropped the pack one last time, and repacked it. With the heat, I've been wearing less clothes, and the extras were in the pack. I had been layering the pack horizontally - sleeping bag, clothes bag, tent, food.  I made the middle vertical - horizontal sleeping bag on the bottom, vertical tent on one side, clothes on the other, food horizontal on top. It lowered the total height of the pack. And I moved the water to the center of the back instead of the side. It actually felt a lot better. Up and down the final 500' to VA624. The hostel was 0.3 miles up the road, but before we got there, the shuttle stopped and picked us up. Poz, who we've been hiking with for a week or so was in the shuttle, coming back from the grocery store. He had a Gatorade for each of us. Ahh.  
Showers, an all you can eat dinner with 14 hungry hikers, conversation about the trail, and a bunk ended our up and down day on the trail.

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589306,"For the first four weeks of our AT adventure, we've been hiking south. Now we're about to head north.Our original plan had us hiking south from Harpers Ferry to VA Route 42. But life is what happens while you're busy making plans, and life intervened. We found ourselves at 4 Pines Hostel, about 2.5 miles north of Dragon's Tooth, a big rocky cliff feature. With rain in the forecast for our hike over this stretch. many people warned us not to attempt Dragon's Tooth in rainy conditions. ""It's dangerous enough dry"", one hiker reported. Others said it was no problem. Who to believe? What to do? Finally, taking into account Ellipsis's shoulder pains from the day before and all the warnings, we decided the universe was trying to tell us to leave Dragon's Tooth for another day. And so, we decided to end our southbound ""flip"" two days early and begin our northbound ""flop"" this week.

When hiking SOBO, we were hiking against the grain. Every day we crossed many hikers heading north. And as we progressed south, we were seeing more and more. Sometimes we stopped to chat but our meetings were always very brief. We could exchange info about trail conditions or events. But then we moved on. Hiking NOBO, we're going with the grain. Now we see the same people several times, often sleeping in the same shelter or the same area. We're starting to get to know some people. The other day we were sitting eating a snack and another hiker passed by. ""Little Feat and Ellipsis, what are you doing here? I thought you went into town."" Someone recognized us.
Hiking SOBO, we still haven't finished Virginia. Hiking NOBO, we've already completed our first full state: Maryland. And Maryland was easy. One Maryland ""shelter"" was a free backpackers campground with tent pads, hot showers, running water, flush toilets and toilet paper! A real luxury spot.
Hiking SOBO through Virginia we were high in the mountains (3500-4000 ft) away from civilization, sort of. Hiking NOBO we're crossing more roads and we'll even walk right through several towns.
Hiking SOBO, we were getting further from home. Hiking NOBO, we're walking home. In a few days we'll get off the trail to spend time with our daughter Joanne. A few days later we'll get off to spend time with Erica. And eventually we'll hike right through Vermont.
We're now one month into our adventure. Next week we'll cross the 300 mile mark. So far, so good...

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590686,"Here’s why hiking in the rain is good:
1. You don’t need sunscreen
2. Less chance of dehydration
3. Temperature is cooler 
4. Snakes are not sunning on the rocks
5. Less hikers about
6. The forest is “mist”-ical
7. You take less breaks, so hike farther
8. Your breaks are shorter, so you hike longer
9. You don’t take side hikes to overlooks and views, so spend more time heading to Maine
10. There has to be a tenth...
We’ve been enjoying rainy weather and longer hiking days this week. We passed 300 miles, and hiked our longest day so far - 17.9 miles. 
Our tent is leaking badly. MSR said they’d replace it if I sent it in. It’d take about a month. “We’re hiking the AT, I can’t wait a month”. They said if I cut it up to make it unusable and sent them a picture, they’d ship it right away - I should get it in a week to 10 days. “We’re hiking the AT, I can’t wait a week”. we finally agreed that I’d write Void by Warranty all over it and send them a picture. The replacement is in the mail. And we can sleep in the voided tent until it comes. 
The woods are absolutely beautiful in the  quiet rain. And exhilarating in a thunderstorm.  It’s not too cold to hike in wet clothes, and we have dry ones for camp. Tonight we’re drying out at a Days Inn. It’s all good.

Ellipsis spent a very long time over the winter poring over maps and guide books putting it together. But like all plans, it doesn’t always work out perfectly. So we have to be flexible. And this is where “breaking it down” comes into play. Each day we look at the plan, check distances and trail conditions and confer with other hikers. How far is the next shelter? The one after that? Where are we in our master plan?What’s the weather forecast say? How do we feel? Taking all that, and more, into account we make a plan for the day. We then head out onto the trail. Even then we have to remain flexible. The other day, for example, we planned to tent in a state park campground but just before we arrived it started raining and camping didn’t look so good. So we decided to stay in the hostel we came to just before the park. Today it’s still raining and we’re a bit warn out and we’re a day ahead of schedule so we decided to hang out in this hotel for “a zero” before heading back out tomorrow for a longish day in more wet weather. Have a plan.

Staff at the Doyle drove us to the store. We dried our clothes at the laundromat. Our boots and packs remain wet, but we’re warm and dry.

Only 9 miles to Jo. We began hiking under blue skies. The trail was typical Pennsylvania rocky - Rocksylvania, they say. The last half mile was a steep drop into Port Clinton. Once in town we made our way to the picnic pavilion at the edge of town where they let hikers hang out. There we found our friend T-Rex and trail legend Bag of Tricks. They provided lunch, water and other great food. Bag of Tricks regaled us with trail stories. 
Ellipsis and I eventually made our way up to the Port Clinton Barber Shop where the owner loves hikers and lets them hang out telling trail stories to customers. They were surprised when we said we wanted hair cuts. The barber shop was a real scene which wil require its own post to do it justice. 
The next day, Enterprise came to pick us up so Ellipsis, T-Rex and I could rent a car. We drove over to Jo’s house, arriving while Jo and Steve were at work. We took showers, did laundry and otherwise made ourselves human again. 
When Jo and Steve got home we went out to dinner with Steve’s parents. As we settled in Jo and Steve broke the big news: Joanne is pregnant! Ellipsis and I will be grandparents again around Christmas time.

The past two days the trail has taken us over several sections of big house-sized rocks. Some places seemed downright dangerous, especially since the rocks were wet in most places. 
Yesterday we climbed up 1000 feet out of Lehigh Gap on damp rocks in the fog. When we reached the top the trail got much better but I was beat. After some discussion we decided to cut our day short and take a night in a B&B. Great decision.
Except that it got us both thinking. Do we really want to do this thing? We’re now past one quarter complete but we still have three quarters to go. We had a long frank discussion and in the end we decided “let’s get out of Pennsylvania then take it from there.” So for now, on we go.

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592984,"if you read our last post you’ll see that we’re starting to have our doubts. As Ellipsis puts it, it’s not a question of CAN we do this, but a question of do we really want to. What a difference a day makes!
Two days ago we had a tough climb that did us in so we got off the trail for a night in a B&B. The next day went much better. Then yesterday we planned to go 14 miles leaving us with only 6 miles to Delaware Water Gap. But we were both feeling good so we kept going and hiked right on in to town. 20.4 miles. Our first 20 mike day. 
So here we are in Delaware Water Gap taking a Zero to resupply and do laundry feeling good about this adventure again. 
So here are the good things we’re seeing right now:
We’re done with hard, long, rocky Pennsylvania We did our first 20 mike dayThe shelters in NJ are closer together so next week looks a little easier. We caught up with some folks we were hiking with
We’ve heard it said, the hard part is not physical but mental and emotional. True, true, true. For today we’re feeling good. Wonder what tomorrow will bring.

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593547,"525 miles, 56 days, physically exhausted and emotionally drained, it is time to stop. Not only can I not go on pretending it’s fun, I simply cannot go on. Little Feat supported me to the end, helping me the last few slow painful miles to the road, and then safely to Kingston. He headed back out today, while I recover with Erica, Rachel and Isaac. I miss him already. I can’t say for certain what happened. Gradually the peaceful renewing forest became unmitigated tedium; the beautiful lookouts mockingly showing our impossibly slow progress. Instead of becoming comfortable with the physical load, pain increased; once at camp each night I limped about, unable to walk normally; my shoulder pain returned; my knee, still sore from a fall a month ago kept me up at night. I was falling apart.At the top of Rattlesnake mountain, between one step and the next I was done. Not done when we reach VT in a month, or when we reach Kingston in a week, but done at the next road crossing, which, unfortunately we would not reach until the following morning.I was unprepared for the fever, chills, joint pain, and uncontrollable sobbing that ensued when I told Little Feat my decision. I was really sick. He helped me to the shelter and put me to bed, and got me to the road and out the next day. Was getting sick what led to my choice to stop, or did my choice lead to getting sick? I don’t know. But either way I am too worn out to continue. Three days later I still can’t get up, walk, or play with my grandson without pain, and all I want to do is curl up and cry. Our dream is shattered around me, but I cannot go on. I gave it my all, but it was not enough. Now I need time to heal and decide how to proceed. I’ll join Erica as Little Feat’s support team, and perhaps slack pack some wth him later in the summer. I’ll spend time with my family and friends who I’ve missed so much. Perhaps I’ll make a quilt for the new grand baby. Perhaps I’ll learn Spanish. I’ll work on recasting my failure to complete the whole AT into the spring I hiked 525 miles,and the great people I met and the glorious adventures I had along the way.Ellipsis signing off...","

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593730,"Hiking the AT was my dream. In 2004 I hiked the Long Trail from one end of Vermont to the other. This gave me the desire to test myself against the big one: 2190 miles. 
Ellipsis was willing to give it a try. And she threw herself completely into making it happen. Dehydrating food, planning itineraries, researching and buying gear. And hiking with me day after day, even as the adventure lost its luster. Ellipsis gave it her all. But in the end it wasn’t enough. Hiking the AT was just not her dream. And so she left the trail. I’ll miss her deeply out here but I fully understand and support her decision. 
Now I press on alone. Part of me really wants to be with Ellipsis and part of me really wants to finish this adventure. 
For the past three days I’ve hiked alone and it’s gone well. But they’ve been easy days: good weather, easy trails. How will it be when the going gets tougher? Can I really do this? Do I really want to?
For now I’ll keep putting one foot in front of another and see how it goes. And I’ll keep on missing my Ellipsis.

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594748,"Woke up this morning in my own bed, clean (!), comfortable, and well-rested.  It's a glorious Vermont summer day and I'm content. 
Little Feat and I have left the AT, at least for the summer. It is the right decision.  It was a grand adventure.
What worked:
We are a great team! We work well together, like spending time together, and the trip brought us closer together.We met great people, had fascinating conversations, and made new friends.We lived through the trail epics - bears, rattlesnakes, hail, lightning, rain for days on end, heat, rocks - and have stories...We watched spring roll up the hills of VA, heard the birds return, smelled the spring flowers.We hiked 530 miles together this year, with Little Feat doing another 70, and this is no little feat!We completed the AT in WV, MD, and PA. Little Feat also completed NJ. The rest is there challenging other hikers, and waiting to see if we return.
What we learned:
We like our adventures in smaller doses. We'd never had the time for an extended trip before, and this one extended beyond our endurance.It's ok to be flexible and modify your goals if they are not working out.We need to adjust our itinerary, taking more advantage of trail towns for food, rest and resupplying. We probably needed to go slower and take more time off.
Little Feat is planning to continue to continue to section hike the AT over time and I may well join him.
A HUGE thank you to Erica for all her support. It made the trip possible. And to all of our friends and family, for your well wishes and support. 
We are glad to be home.

Little Feat and ...,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594752,"Yes, its true. I've also left the trail. I hiked on for about 5 days after Ellipsis left. But, in the end, the task was just too big. On the final day, I was faced with rainy weather, difficult hiking, and uncertainty as to where to camp. And I was lonely without Ellipsis to help me figure it all out. Yes, I could have figured it out for that one day, but what about the next, and the next, and... So I made my way to a motel, called Ellipsis and cashed it in.
I find myself second guessing that decision a lot: ""If I had only (fill in the blank), I could've gone on"". But each time I do that, the fact that I still had over 2/3 of the trail to cover brings me back to reality.
Yes, I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to do the whole trail. But I'm also proud of the fact that I hiked 600 miles in 8 weeks. Not many people can make that claim. And that sure is a good start on completing the trail in sections, which I certainly hope to do. 
It was a grand adventure: 600 miles, 2 bears, 4 rattlesnakes, 4 black rat snakes (huge, ugly, but harmless), countless deer, and seemingly endless rock walls to climb over. And the best is still to come...
But for now, as Ellipsis says, its nice to be home in our comfortable bed enjoying Vermont's summer.
