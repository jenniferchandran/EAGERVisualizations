 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550663,"I'm opening a new journal for 2018. It's been a tough decision to fall back to my original plan. When I changed my plan to 2017, I didn't realize how it would upset some of my family. They have good valid reasons for me to wait and I respect their wishes for me to wait. My family support is very important in hiking the trail. I couldn't have gotten as far as I did in 2014 without their cheering me on. I'll be again following the journal entries here as I wait for my turn to come. Am I disappointed? Yes, in some ways. I will not be hiking with CeeBee or Willow or meet people I have been following in the 2017 group. I am also relieved because I know it is the right decision and is the right thing for me to do. Our comfortable hiking season is coming in here in Southern California. I'll get my miles in for strength and endurance. The holidays are moving in quickly. May you all enjoy the season of celebrations and be well.Hummingbird Ellie",,Onward to 2018 ,"Oct 18, Tue",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550676,"I just realized that I need three entries to be ""seen"".   Ok.. This is the second one. Same day.. On my next hike I plan to take more photo's and more entries into the journal. I realize how important that is for documenting where I stop and to ""remember"" years from now just how it looked and who happened to be there at the same time. I have vivid memories from my last hike but I know that many of them come from looking at other trail journal photo's. It's odd that when I look at the places, I can actually ""feel"" the way it felt and ""smell"" the way it smelled when I was at that same spot.",,Second Entry,"Oct 18, Tue",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550677,"Number three it is.    Concerns on the trail that I had in 2014 were really minimal. It was a good year for water. I had one spot that was listed as a source but was dry. Trail Angels covered that with gallons of water lined up along the trail. Wild animals was a concern at first. After a few days, I became comfortable being in Nature. I did see a few bears but they weren't concerned with me.   Snakes weren't threatening. I felt comfortable walking along taking in the sights and sleeping in my tent. What I will be changing for this coming hike is lightening my pack. I sent home things last time and know I will start off this time much lighter. A tough lesson to learn when you start out carrying more than you need. I'll have to enter my new gear list. Enjoy October, the cooler weather and beautiful Autumn leaves. I wish I was in New England at this time. I grew up in Massachusetts, where later on I lived in Vermont and New Hampshire. California is my home now where my husband and children and baby grandson are. Happy October to all of you.. Time to carve your pumpkins!",,Third Entry,"Oct 18, Tue",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551135,"Hello! Here we are coming into November. The fun of Halloween has passed and we look forward to the coming holidays. The election will be here soon. I hope you all get out and vote. I hope our new President will support our Parks and Trails. It's become such an active pastime over the years. People of all ages, young and old are getting out to enjoy time in Nature.   I am so looking forward to my hike in 2018. Though it is a better time for me hike then, I still feel that pull for 2017. It will be tough when April arrives and I am not out there. I'm thankful for the journals here that will keep me connected at a distance. Today I went for my eye exam and need glasses now. I have used those ""cheaters"" for reading but now I am needing prescribed glasses for distance. Another mark of aging.   Ugh!   Now I will have to deal with eyeglasses on the trail. I'll have to learn how to take care of them while hiking. The Santa Ana winds have arrived blowing down hanging plants and wind chimes. It does make it uncomfortable to hike in the canyons. There are mini dust storms and the air is so dry it messes up my sinus's.   Hopefully, it won't last long and we can enjoy our outings again. I'm enjoying the journal entries from those who have completed the trail this year. I only hope that I can experience completing the trail. I can only imagine all the images that are locked forever in their memories. It makes me so proud of these people I have never met. Good Job! You are Fantastic! Have a happy November in all that you do.",,November arrived! ,"Nov 02, Wed",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552099,"Christmas lights, events and shopping are already well on their way to celebrate the season.   I've been working on my list and hoping that I can give my family gifts that are hiking related. Maybe you have some ideas? I know REI should help me out with some things.   My little grandson Landon will be walking soon. He's standing and walking around furniture. I can just imagine him hiking with me one day. He loves trees and touching plants and flowers already. This year has gone by so quickly and seeing how fast he has grown, makes me know that 2017 will will move right along as well. I'll be ready for a 2018 thru hike. I've been able to wear my warm gear with the recent cold spell we are having here in California. The nights have fallen into the 40's and my warm clothes have kept me toasty on my walks. I feel I have made good choices. I wish you all a wonderful Christmas and that the New Year will be one of your best ever!",,December.. It's here! ,"Dec 03, Sat",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552968,"Happy 2017!   What an exciting year ahead for those of us who are going to the trail this year and for those of us who will be anxiously counting down the days until 2018! I hope you have had a wonderful Christmas and New Year's Day.   It's that time again to set some resolutions for this year. I know that mine is to keep on hiking and getting myself into hiking form.   This first week hasn't been very productive in setting the pace. Company visiting and planning out my grandson Landon's first birthday tomorrow, has taken up more time than I had planned on. So it will be next week that I begin my daily routine and hope that this year will not be overfilled with interruptions. Sometimes though, we just have to take a break to enjoy those we love. Zero days.. ha As long as there aren't too many of those. My plan for this year is to hike as many trails as I can in our area. I am following a local hiking group site that I hope to hike with from time to time. It gives me information on the different trails here if I choose to solo hike.   Like the AT, it's nice to know what to expect from the trail before we hike it.. I'm happy with my gear choices and don't expect to be making changes in it. That's an expensive game to play. Ha. The trail will let me know in no time if I need something more or have brought more than I need.Good Luck to those who are hiking out very soon! I can only imagine your anxiety, your worries and the joy you are feeling that it's almost time to begin. I'll be following you along the way. Please do keep us updated on your journey as you make your way from Springer to Katahdin! We'll be cheering you on all the way!",,Happy New Year!,"Jan 05, Thu",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553586,"At this time, I am switching to the 15 mile a day Average on the AWOL schedule. I found that I was able to do more miles on my last hike in 2014. My hiker legs kicked in and it was very energizing! ha. 
The next stop on the schedule will be Day 5 to Low gap Shelter. 
I'll be crossing

 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553640,"Wow.. we are having rain and more rain here in Southern California. We do need it for sure. The saying ""When it rains, it pours"" is true today. It makes me think of the rainy days on the trail. I don't mind the rain when I am dressed for it and don't experience any ""chills"" from the damp cool or cold air. I'm confident in the rain gear I have geared up with. My Frog Togs are large enough to cover my jacket if I need one and if not, makes it roomy enough with just my t-shirt to keep me from building up a sweat. The pants cover my long pants and the tops of my boots. They are easy enough to take off over the boots, so can be put on and off as needed. They are also a good coverup for laundry day so I can wash all of my clothes at once. It may not be fashionable attire, but on the trail fashion is not an issue and in town, they can be a conversation fashion statement! Ha. If you do find they wear out, you can replace them at one of the Walmart's along the way. 
On the Awol schedule, Day 6 brings me to Tray Mountain Shelter. The first 15 mile day. I'll be passing: 

Poplar Stamp Gap has tenting and water available. This stretch of the hike has many streams for water. No need to carry more than your water bottles full. 

Cold Springs Gap

Chattahoochee Gap 

Red Clay Gap 

Site of the Rocky Knob Shelter. Tenting and Water. This shelter was torn down and replaced a mile further north with the Blue Mountain Shelter.
Blue Mountain Shelter, Towns County: water. privey , tenting and shelter. 
Blue Mountain: Steep decent to Unicol Gap Originally an Indian Trail , it became the route of the first road across the mountain now Ga Route 75 built circa 1812. Unicom is Cherokee for ""white"" but it is not known; if the name predates the turnpike or weather it was assigned by the traders who used it. 
Unicol Gap GA 75. At this spot, you reach a parking lot where you can leave the trail for Helen GA or Hiawassee.

Helen GA, Incorporated in 1913 and named for Helen Bagley, the daughter of lumber baron Henry Bagley, The town is nicknamed the ""Star of the North"" 
 
Near here is Henson Gap named for a man who was killed here in frontier days, his first and last name and the circumstances of his death are unknown. 

Following the schedule, the Hiawassee town visit will come after Tray Mountain. 

Rocky Mountain: Tenting and Picture stop! 

Indian Grave Gap USFS 283 Parking lot, The gap is visible from the trail, but you must descend on a side trail to see the rock cairn monument, a mound about 2 feet high that mars a loan grave. One Indian Grave to be found.. I wonder who he was and why a monument. . 
Cheese Factory Site: A level area good for tenting. No remains of the factory.
Tray Gap. Tray mountain road: parking lot, tenting. Believed to be a corruption of Trail Mountain, a name given by Cherokee because there were many trails leading to the summit and over the mountain.
Tray mountain: Picture time! 
Tray Mountain Shelter Habersham County: Privy, water, tenting. Bear cables.",,Tray Mountain Shelter,"Jan 22, Sun",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554012,"I got my 2017 Awol loose leaf guide. I wanted to see if I like using it now as I prepare for the hike. It is good in that I can throw away the pages as I use them on the hike. But again, it is nice having them all bound together so the pages don't get lost or mixed up. It's easier to flip through the book. 
Day 7 on the trail should bring me into Hiawassee, Georgia.  
 
From Tray Mountain, I'll be passing through: 



Wolfpen Gap is noted that During frontier days, wolves were considered the scourge of the land. Domestic farm and stock animals provided easy pickings for the predators. And since nearly everyone had some animals, even if just a few chickens and a cow, wolves in the eyes of settlers, could take food off the table of anyone's household. Various schemes offering cash for their hides were developed to encourage the wolves' eradication. A farmer who couldn't be bothered to turn in the hide would often nail the carcass to a tree our fencepost to show his neighbors that he was doing his part. Today it is not uncommon to see coyote remains in a similar state. Wolf pens were deadfull traps commonly used by mountain settlers. A deadfall trap is constructed of heavy tree limbs and is triggered by the weight of the animal. When the limbs fall they strike the animal in the head or pin it to the ground. 

Steel trap gap has access to water

Young Lick Knob 

Swag of the Blue Ridge ""Swag"" is a local term for the sag, a low saddle ridge. 

Sassafras Gap has tenting and water access

Addis Gap has tenting and water access. Named of the Addis family that lived in the area until 1942 

Kelly knob has water access down a steep slope

Deep Gap Shelter, Rabun County, : has a privy, and water access , Vista blue blaze leads to tenting a mile ahead.

McClure Gap 

Powell Mountain is a good place for phone service to call for a shuttle ride to meet you at Dicks Gap
Moreland Gap has water
Dicks Creek Gap US76 has a parking lot, water, picnic tables and is where you leave for Hiawassee 
 
For some reason, Dismal Knob is mentioned in the Appalachian Trail Names book I am reading. It is in this area but I found no mention of it in the guidebooks. Not necessarily a gloomy place, the word ""dismal"" was often applied to areas that were unsuited for agriculture. 

Hiawassee has everything you need to replenish your food and gear. Plenty of places to choose to stay at or even camp at the Standing Indian Campground.  Mile 52 OR 69 – Hiawassee, GA: If you stay at Top of Georgia hostel, 706-982-3252, multiple shuttles are available into town. Budget Inn, 706-896-4121 in Hiawassee is another lodging option that will come pick you up and deliver you back to the trail if you choose to stay there.  I'll be looking up some of the motels and Inns to decide where I want to stay. 
The Top of Georgia Hostel has a free shuttle and will take you into Hiawassee. I will consider that if I only need a resupply and not to want to spend more time in town. 
More information on Haiwassee. North of Haiwasse is Chatuge Lake that connects Georgia and North Carolina. The Cherokee word for ""meeting of waters"" was given earn the Tennessee Valley Authority created the lake by damming the confluence of Shooting Creek and the Haiawasee River. I may go the fairgrounds if there is an event while I am there. It's on the lake and there are campgrounds nearby. 
I'll be looking for hikers opinons as I follow the 2017 journals.
It's a beautiful day here today in Tujunga Ca. I'll be working at the Bolton Hall museum in just a few minutes. This morning was working on car issues, so we didn't get out to hike. Maybe this evening we can at least take an evening walk. Any exercise is good exercise!",,Hiawassee Resupply,"Jan 31, Tue",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554394,"It's a beautiful day here today in Tujunga, CA. I know the Groundhog predicted six more weeks of winter but it sure seems to be warming up already!   Bring on Spring!!
Reading the entries of those who will be leaving soon makes me ache to be leaving too. I will be following along with your journals and imagining every step of the way. I especially will be watching CeeBee as she makes her way North. I'm not with you on the trail but sure will be in spirit! March is just around the corner! 
Looking at the Awol schedule, Day 8 would bring me to Muskrat Creek Shelter. This takes me from Dick's Creek Gap where I return to the trail from Hiawassee,. 
 Then onto Muskrat Shelter passing through 
 Chunky Gal trail crosses by the shelter to Chunky Gal Mountain. One legend tells of a chubby Cherokee maiden who left her family to be with her lover of another tribe. Other researchers say a more likely origin is that Chunky Gal is the anglicized form of an unknown Cherokee word. 
It will be a day of many ups and downs. 
Coward Gap has water.
Buzzard Knob and Bull Gap have water a mile ahead.

Plumorchard Gap Shelter, Towns County, has a Privy, water and tenting area. 
 As Gap

Blue Ridge Gap has a dirt road no longer passable by a car. Water and tenting a mile ahead.
 Rich Cove Gap. 
The GA/NC border is at mile 78.2   State number 2! Look for the old and twisted tree for a photo moment! The Cherokee National Forest.  North Carolina is 88 miles of the Appalachian Trial.

Located in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of east Tennessee, the Cherokee National Forest is divided into northern and southern sections by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The 650,000-acre forest is the largest tract of public land in Tennessee and adjoins other national forests in Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia. Cherokee is thought to be either a Choctaw word meaning ""cave People or a Creek word meaning ""people of different speech"". The Cherokee actually called themselves Yunwiyd"" a word of lost origin. The land encompassing the national forest was purchased from timber companies after they stripped it and left its slopes to erode. There forest was established in 1912 , when foresters began to assemble parcels from VA, NC, GA and TN. In 1920, it was formally dedicated as Utaka National forrest: the name was changed to Cherokee in 1936 . Today the forest encompasses some 630.000 acres. 


Bly Gap has tenting and water.
Just past Sassafras Gap is a piped spring.
Muskrat Creek Shelter, Clay County, is a half mile ahead with privey, water, tenting available. 
Something that I am really enjoying are the You Tube video's of all the places along the trail. I especially find Red Beard and Toast video's enjoyable. I'm following them as I go along and really ""feel"" how it will be on the trail. I won't be leaving as early as they did and hope that the temperatures won't drop as low. 
Time to go read some journals.. Have a good evening,",,Muskrat Creek Shelter ,"Feb 09, Thu",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554736,"Here it is February 17th already! I hope you had a nice Valentine's Day. Rick and I went to the Camellia Festival at the Descanso Gardens. It was a beautiful day for walking, learning about the Camellia's and getting exercise. We love that place! Next month the Cherry Blossoms will be out and we'll go to that festival! I won't be on the trail, but I'll be outside as much as possible.  My hiking schedule for 2018 tells me I should be aiming for the Carter Gap Shelter..
 
From Muskrat Creek Shelter, that will take me through:

Whiteoak Stamp, has a fairly new tenting area and water. A stamp is an open area where livestock were gathered in the 19th century after summers of grazing in the forest, The gathering point in this stamp was a great White oak.
 
Water Oak Gap, The Water Oak is a tree. but it does not grow in this area. Perhaps it once did., or perhaps the namers called another tree species the wrong name. 
 
Two springs with good water 

Deep Gap, USFS 71 Kimsey Creek Trail parking water and stating. Signed campsite with register box on KC Trail 

Standing Indian Shelter, Macon County.  Campsites on side trail Lower ridge to the west.

Standing Indian Mountain,   A photo stop from the summit. Gap: Dakota tells us this area is still charred from the forest fires last year. Soot everywhere. Standing Indian Mountain A rock formation visible from the AT near the summit gives the mountain it's name. The Cherokee called it it ""Yunwitsule- nunvi "", meaning ""where the man stood"". In their legend , a monster came from the sky and stole children, terrorizing the Indians for their practice of clearing mountaintops for signal stations and lookouts. The Indians trapped the beast on the south slope of the mountain and implored the Great Spirit to send thunder and lightening to destroy it. When the storm came, an Indian warrior fled the mountain instead of remaining at his post. He was turned to stone for his cowardice and remains there still. photo spot 
 
Beech Gap, Tenting area with water 

Beech Mountain Cherokees called it ""Klonteska, meaning ""pheasant"", which feasted on the nuts of the beech trees here. The trees led to the current name. It was a favored Indian hunting area. A legend tells of a battle between two Indian tribes fought on Beach Mountain. One tribes chief was so shamed by the number of men he lost that he hanged himself atop the mountain. The nation's original ""interstate highway"" an indian trail known as the Great Trading Path, which connected VA with GA, crossed Beech Mountain. Then the town of Beach Mountain was incorporated in 1981, it became the highest town in the eastern U.S. 

Spring 

Coleman Gap, 

Timber Ridge just before Carter Gap Shelter. 

Carter Gap Shelter, Clay County : Tenting, water and Privy. The ""Old"" Carter Gap Shelter, Macon County, was replaced. This new shelter is across the AT from the old shelter. 

I'm reading entries about mailing food boxes. I didn't do that in 2014 and will not do it in 2018. There are just too many convenient places to get fresh food along the way. I didn't cook along the trail and ate my hot meals when I got off the trail. My resupply consisted of cheese, meat, tuna, wraps, fruit and veggies and gorp of course. Every stop was a treat to shop for food I was in the mood to eat. No paying high postage rates to send boxes that I had to pick up along the way. It worked out very well. It was very common to see people handing out food they mailed to themselves or putting it in the hiker boxes because they sent too much or were sick of the same food everyday. 
It's a rainy day again. Expecting rain storms all weekend. We need it! Water level is rising and it looks like the drought will be over for awhile. It's a reminder to me that there will be rainy days on the trail! Hopefully, not too many! Ha. 
 I picked up Ronald Fishers ""Appalachian Trail"" book at the library. It was printed in 1971 so I will enjoy seeing how the trail has changed since then.

 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555041,"Good Morning. It's a chilly day here in Tujunga today. 42 at 9 AM. Rick and I will be heading out at 10 for a hike in the canyon. It's at least a sunny day and should feel warmer. ha.

On the projected schedule for my hike next year, I should be reaching Franklin NC on my tenth day. 
Mile 110 – Franklin, NC: At Winding Stair Gap, US 64, hitch a ride into Franklin. Or call Haven's Budget Inn at 828-524-4403 and see if they can pick you up. While in town, visit the Lazy Hiker Brewing Company and Rock House Lodge to celebrate exiting your first state!  You can also resupply at Gooder Grove Hostel & Adventure Ctr.Franklin was awarded the top small town for adventure by the Blue Ridge Outdoors in 2015 and 2016.
This will take me through.

Bear pen Gap ""Pen"" refers to deadfall traps commonly used in the mountains by early settlers to capture bear for food and their hides. A deadfall trap is constructed of heaven, broken tree limbs, which fall when triggered by the weight of the animal. When they fall, they usually pin the animal or strike its head, which usually kills it. Once gone from much of the eastern US in the early 20th century,, bears are now often seen by AT hikers.

I stayed at Budget Inn back in 2014 for a few days because of severe storms. This time, I plan to stay at the Gooder Grove AT & adventure Hostel. It's in a different part of town near more places to check out within walking distance. Plenty of places to eat and shop at. 
There are some you tube video's that are interesting to watch about Franklin. Check them out.
Have a good day today. I'll be reading the journals of those who are on the trail now and adding any suggestions and information they might give on the places we will be seeing in 2018.",,"Franklin, NC Resupply","Feb 23, Thu",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555131,"It's cold out today. Woke up at 6:00 34 degrees on the back porch. I guess March will come in like a lion and go out like a lamb after all. 
We did get a good hike in the canyon. It's an all uphill climb! I think it's a great workout hike from what I remember the mountains being on the trail. Switchbacks make a big difference for sure. That little flat break gives the body a chance to relax for a moment. 
I weighed my pack again after removing several ""little"" things that I thought would be nice to have. It's just under 17 lbs. I will need to create a first aid kit and anything else that are a ""must have"". I expect two pounds will more than cover it. I'll make my goal of 20 lbs or less.   
Yesterday, I bought a new blow up pad. I love the accordion style Thermarest pad but it's just too bulky and has to be strapped onto my pack. I want to keep it as sleek as possible, so I am trying out another blow up pad. The past blow ups were too noisy and slippery. This pad claimes to be better in both cases. It's the Klymit Ultralight V from Massdrop. It inflates in v-shape air pockets instead of straight air pockets. I'll let you know if it's as comfortable as they claim it to be. 

Looking ahead on my 2018 hike with the 15 mile per day average. I should be at Wayah Shelter on the 11th day of my hike. I'll be returning to Winding Stair Gap from Franklin.
Moore Creek Campsite has tenting and water available to the west.

Swinging Lick Gap is a comical name. As you can imagine the sign has been altered from Lick to Dick. Ha. There is a cute site on You Tube to watch concerning weird names on the trail.

 USFS69 piped spring 

Bartram Trail to the west William Bartram was to the Smokies what Lewis and Clark were to the western US. His explorations of FL, GA, NC,and Al. which began in 1775 , have sparked the imagination of explorers, naturalists and historians ever since. In his journal The Travels of William Bertram, published in 1791, he documented the plants and animals he observed as he traveled along an Indian trade route from the Cherokee town Nikwasi (present day Franklin) to the Nantahala River. The book is also an early document of Cherokee life. Travels is considered one of the earliest and finest examples of American nature writing in the spirit of later writers Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. A 118 mile hiking trail through NC and GA and extending 8 miles into AL follows Bertram's route, based on references from his journal. 

Wine Spring Rd to the east has campsites and water.

USFS 69 has a paved footpath to Latrines and parking. 

Wayah Bald stone tower for a photo moment Great Building and view! I just watched a you tube showing that the roof and signs on the top of the tower were burned up in the forest fires. So sad. The stone building has survived and is still a great look out spot! 

Wayah Bald Shelter, Macon County, has water, privy and tenting. 
I do plan to tent as much as possible. The shelters are great when the weather is bad but it also has it's downside of mice, snoring hikers, unpleasant odors and close quarters. I have been thankful for shelters on my last hike when it was raining or windy on the top of a mountain. Most shelters are near or in the gaps which are more protected from the weather. You will have a nice decent at the end of the day but the morning welcomes you with a climb. 
More and more hikers are heading out on the trail. Good luck to all of you and keep us posted as you travel along.",,Wayah Bald Shelter,"Feb 25, Sat",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558315,"Good Morning.. The clock tells me it is 1:00. I can't sleep. My mind is buzzing with thoughts of the trail and my heart is aching to be out there. March flew by. I hope you all had a good month. At this time next year I will have hiked up the Approach Trail and would be officially hiking the AT on April 1st. Today, I decided it would be a good time to take everything out of my backpack and look at it. Then I carefully put it all back making sure I have it packed up where it feels right. My sleeping bag on the bottom, My clothes stuffed in all the spaces making it nice and tight. The little first aid kit and personal hygiene bag in the inside pack pocket. My pad isn't here yet, but that will go on top of the sleeping bag. Then my tent, my ground cloth next. The electronics and guidebook bag protected in my fleece pullover and lastly, my food bag. I use lots of ziplock bags to protect everything. I don't use the trash bag or compactor bag to line the backpack. I found that to be very annoying when I was last on the trail. I do have a pack cover and my rain gear in the outside back pocket that I can access quickly when the rain falls. My rubber/plastic camp shoes are hooked on the outside of my pack. I will welcome them at the end of each day and in town. I weighed the pack again and it is at 15 lbs. That is just where it should be. I'll be adding the blow up pad and a few little things that I need to wait until my hiking time gets closer. I expect it will be less than 20 lbs. Less than 25 with food and water. I learned my lesson the hard way on that last hike. I laugh at myself when I think how miserable I was with over 40 lbs. to carry. I sent home 20 lbs of stuff I didn't need. Though I really can't imagine that those who hike with under ten lbs of gear enjoy the hike. I would love to be able to do that for speed but I also loved climbing into my tent at night like a hummingbird in it's nest. I woke up ready for the new days adventure! I'll be going to see my grandson Landon this weekend. My daughter and I are checking out preschools and have two appointments for tours. Sharon is preparing for when I won't be there to help her next year. He will be two then and ready to enjoy other little friends. Though my husband Rick and Sharon would prefer that I don't go, they know what it means to me and will help me make it happen. I don't expect it will take six months. I learned that I took too many zero days and the week off for Trail days in Damascus. That was a mistake.   Sharon had flown out to be with me. We had a good time but I plan on being further up on the trail at that time next year. It's very important to make the hike the priority and not the zero days. My bed is calling.. Hopefully, I can sleep now. May you all have a good day.. and no one plays any tricks on you!",,April Fools Day,"Apr 01, Sat",0

As you approach the Jump Off hikers will enjoy great views of Mount LeConte towards the northwest. It has a panoramic view for a great photo shot! 
A Rufus Morgan Shelter , Swain County, named after Reverend Rufus Morgan. an Episcapalian minister born near Franklin NC. who founded the Nantahala Hiking Club in the 1940's and almost single handedly maintained the AT in the Smokies during World War II and well into his 70's, he kept clear a 55 mile section., At age 81, Morgan joined a protest walk of a 576 hikers who opposed the construction of a road across the Smokies. The hikers won the battle. Morgan was renowned for climbing Mt. LeConte more than 100 times, the last time was after reaching over 90. A Naturalist, Author, explorer: Rufus Morgan was one of the early pioneers in the founding and development of the Appalachian Trail. Raised in the far western mountains of North Carolina he was well acquainted with the various peaks and valleys of the area. Following the proposal for a national trail to follow the spine of the Appalachian Trail he was a natural to develop the trail route from the Georgia Border to The Great Smokey Mountains National Park. He was the original author of the Appalachian Trail Guide for this part of the path. Over the years he introduced thousands of people to the Appalachian Trail, the Nantahala Gorge, and the National Park. He was blind for much of his later years of life. During this time he continued to lead trail hikes up to Wayah Bald or LeConte Lodge. Though blind he was so familiar with the trail he would stop and turn to a nearby tree and point out a blooming wild flower at the base of the tree. He was a founder of the Nantahala Hiking Club. 
Nantahala Outdoor Center NOC is a great stop along the trail. I stayed here on my first hike and had a wonderful time. This may possibly be a stay over again for me .. 
Grassy gap to Jump-up gap I will pass the plaque dedicated to a Forest Ranger. On December 7, 1968, 783 feet southwest of this monument, Wade A.

I just read Tigger’s entry. His brother made an adorable little tigger design that’s on his site. Check it out. Tigger also gives great gear recommendations. I’ve taken his advice on several things that I will update in my own pack. Unfortunately, Tigger is recovering from a bum knee but hopefully, will be back on the trail soon. Check out his journal when you get a chance. It’s a good read. 
Continuing on my journal journey, next year on this day I hope to be heading for Fontana Dam Shelter. 
Mile 164  Fontana General Store: Located 2 miles west of the A.T. from the point you cross Hwy 28. The trail takes you right to the visitor’s center which offers snacks, but I wouldn’t call it a full resupply.  This is your last chance to print your Smokies Permit  and to resupply before entering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
I’ll be leaving Cable Gap Shelter, Graham County and have a shorter hike of 6.6 miles for the day.
Black Gum Gap Northerners might mistake the name for a sweet licorice treat but the black gum is a tree common in this part of the south. 
 The Black Mountains dense cover of deep green spruce and fir gives these ridges their name. 
Walker Gap There is a footbridge with a stream 0.2 miles ahead.
Choices to be made:: You resupply in Fontana Village and need to get your park permit for the Smokies if you haven’t already done that! I got mine on my computer. You can estimate when you expect to be crossing the Smokies and there is a generous allowance of time to get through if you date is not exactly right.

Fontana Dam Shelter , Graham County, The Fontana Hilton! It’s a great camping area.. Shower and picnic tables.. 
Dam Visitor Center Call from the center to stay at Hike Inn.,    
I’m planning at staying at the Hilton this time. I stayed at the Village on my last hike. There are evening lake cruises that I might try if the weather and price are agreeable./ not far from, Fontana Dam Is Bee Cove Lead. In the south, a ""cove"" is a small valley or hollow and a ""lead"" is a spur leading of a larger mountain. ""Bee"" likely is derived from the abundance of black gum trees here, which have long been used by beekeepers to make hives. 
 Fontana Lake is the sixth highest dam in the country. It's waters submerged the small lumber company town of Fontana According to Allen Coggins ""Place Names of the Smokies, the name of the town was suggested by the wife of the lumber company's executive vice president She called it Fontana for its waterfalls, which reminded her of leaping fountains, and the word had a romantic Italian sound to it. Noggins points out another Italian connection, Supposedly , an Italian naturalist na med Felice Fontana visited the area in the 1700's.. Another explanation of the town's name is that Fontana is derived from an undetermined Indian word, said to mean ""at the foot of the mountain"" The Fontana Dam was built to supply power for the Oak Ridge nuclear plant where plutonium was produced for atomic weapons, At the time of its construction it was the fourth largest dam in the world.

Greer Knob nearby Doe Knob, has a story, In the late 19th century Andy Greer of Cades Cove pastured some of his oxen here in the summer One night Greer's Oxen and some cattle huddled together on this knob during an intense electrical storm Because the animals were in this high elevation summer pasture, Greer at home, was unable to reach his livestock before the storm hit. A lightning strike in the vicinity charged the land beneath the animals with ground current killing them all. 

Mud Gap
Ekaneetlee Gap has water Ekaneetlee is and anglicized corruption of egwanulti, said to be a Cherokee term for ""by the river"" referring to the Cherokee route from valley villages to settlements on the other side of the mountain. Cases Cove, a white settlement along the route, had been a place of importance to the Cherokee also. They called it tsiyahi, or ""otter place.'

The Cherokee lived on a bend in the Little Tennessee river, now submerged under Chilhowee Lake. 
Big Abrams Gap
Russell Field Shelter has water A decent shelter. 

 Gregory Bald Trail. Russel Gregory came to Cades Cove sometime between 1820 and 1830 to farm , He tended cattle on this bald and built a stone cabin there. He was locally famous for his method of calling cattle to the top of the bald, then called Bald Spot Mountain: he would blow a large horn to summon his herd, Although Gregory spent much of his time in the mountains, he was involved in the civic life of Cades Cove.. During the Civil War, he was pro-Union, but his son was a confederate. In 1884, Russell Gregory led the residents of Cades Cove to turn back Confederate raiders who had been pillaging the area. No one was killed in the confrontation, but that night raiders returned and murdered Gregory. His son had been among the raiders in the earlier skirmish. 

You will find the shelters in the Smokies to be well cared for and checked by the ridge runner rangers. 
Looking for information on the places I will hike through, I found an interesting book on Amazon that I have ordered. It’s called Appalachian Trail Names (Official Guides to the Appalachian Trail) You may want to check it out. I’ll be adding information to the listed places when I get the book.

I’ll look into that. Wouldn’t it be nice to have some help with gear.. 
My continuing hiking plan will take me from Russell Field Shelter 14.7 miles to my next stop at Silers Bald Shelter.
 Spence Field Shelter- I just saw a YouTube video on a bear attack at Spence Field last year. That was a bit unsettling. I would recommend sleeping in the shelter there rather than tent They were tenting because the shelter was full. Two tents were shredded that night by a bear. One hiker had bites on his calf and fortunately made it to the shelter for help. The Rangers were called and took evidence to catch the bear that did this. I do believe that once a bear attacks a person it has to be put down. It's unfortunate but necessary to prevent future attacks. It's very important not to have anything that is edible or smell edible in your tent. 

 Davis Ridge is not far from here. Named for Ann Lovella Patrick Davis, who first conceived the idea of Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1923. She and her shebang, influential businessman Willis Perkins Davis, worked to promote the idea. In 1925. Ann Davis was elected to the TN General Assembly where she introduced the bill to purchase the first large parcel of land for the park. For this she is known as the ""Mother of the Park"" 
 
Great Smoky Mountains: The Cherokee called the mountains Shacona-ga typically translated to mean ""blue, like smoke"" for the bluish haze that hangs over them. The haze comes from a combination of humidity from the many streams tumbling down the mountain, dense vegetation and soil type. The mountains were previously called ""The Great Iron Mountains"" The Cherokee also called them ""Unica, meaning ""white"" from this word Utaka and Unicol were derived and used to name specific mountains in the area . The first documentation of the mountains by settlers is a 1789 government decree about the border between NC and TN. The Great Smoky Mountains NP was the first to be created using private donations to purchase private land. Between 1925 and 1940 more than 6000 parcel were strung together, totaling some 400,000 acres .

Legend says that after the Cherokee captured the magician Shawn during battle , he convinced them to spare hid life in return for the capture of Uktena, the evil serpent. When the Cherokee and their prisoner entered the gap, they encountered a giant frog which terrified the captors. Shawn got a big laugh out to their terror. The meaning of the parable is lost.

My planned trek for today will be 15.5 miles to Icewater Spring Shelter.   The miles now are picking up. I should have my hiker legs by now. It’s a goal but not set in stone. If I find I am lagging a bit, I can switch back to the 12 mile a day average. From my last hike, I was up to speed to handle the 15 mile average. 
Mile 207 – Newfound Gap, Gatlinburg: A shuttle or hitch is definitely required to make it 15 miles from here into Gatlinburg, but if you’ve never experienced the city, it’s worth the trip! Resupply options, honestly, aren’t as great as you’d expect in a town with so much to offer, but there’s enough to be found at pharmacies and the tiny grocers on the strip to make it another few days on trail.  Unique experiences, a plethora of food, and Smoky Mountain Brewery are a few notable mentions in town.

 Clingmans Dome. Tower to the East. Photo stop. A must see! Highest mountain in the Smokies. Beautiful! There is a You Tube video worth watching "" Clingmans Dome - Highpoint of the Great Smoky Mountains"" Called Kuwa-hi, or ""mulberry place"". by the Cherokee, it was said to be the place where bears danced before their hibernation. Settlers called it Smoky Dome. Thomas Lanier Clingman, a former student of Elisha Mitchell, led the party that measured the dome's height in 1858. Clingman would later become a Confederate general and senator of NC. Some blame the untimely death of Mitchell on Clingman. He disputed Mitchell's claim that the mountain which would be named Mitchell was the highest east of the Mississippi. After a public row, the elderly Mitchell returned to the wilds alone to measure his peak: he was found dead on the mountain sometime later. 
 From the parking lot of Clingman's Dome, is the Goshen Prong Trail A prong is aa fork or tributary Goshen here, as elsewhere along the AT and the Appalachians, is a biblical reference to fertile ground .

 Nearby is the Bote Mountain Trail. When a road was to be built from Cades Cove in TN across the Smokies to Tuckasegee the route was determined by the builders, many of whom were cherokee Indians who were asked to vote on the road's location. It's rough terrain here, so there was much deliberation over the vote. because there is no sound in the language, the cherokee referred to the routing process as taking the vote. The route chosen, and then the peak. became known at Bote. The losing route was christened defeat Ridge.

On the way to Tricorner Knob Shelter, I'll be hiking 12.6 miles from Icebreaker Spring Shelter. 
I'll be passing the South and North end of the Charles Bunion Loop. Photo stop This is named for the Charles Bunion rock that sticks out from the surrounding ridge like a bunion. It was named by famed naturalist and author Horace Kephart for his hiking companion Charlie Conner, who is said to have described this feature as ""about the size of this bunion on my foot"". Another story tells of Conner resting here to soothe an aching foot while he and Kephart were on a reconnaissance mission to inspect fire and storm damage in the Smokies.
 
Fodder Stack is the lower peak of the mountain called Charlies Bunion Derivations of the dutch word Fodderstack, dot the Appalachians in nearly as great a number as ""sugar Loaf"" Fodder is livestock feed composed of whatever edible grains, grasses and stalks are available. Loosely translated, fodder stack means ""hay"" or Haystack"". So this mountain is one more known as Haystack, a descriptive name for its shape, 

Dry Sluice Gap The stream is a classic sink or subsurface channel. It flows aboveground for a time, then disappears into the ground. The aboveground bed channels high-water overflows, but is dry most of the year.
The Sawteeth Photo spot! Nearly 2 miles long, the ridge is a succession of sharp knobs and broken peaks. In places only a foot wide and rarely much more than 10 inches. It's jagged teeth are all that stand between hikers and a long tumble. 

Porter's Gap Photo spot!   Porter's mountain named for James P. H. Porter, a lawyer and politician. On one occasion as Democratic candidate for the state legislature, he was defeated by a single vote. He lived in Sevierville, TN in a place called Porters Flat for most of his life. He died May 1, 1846 
 False Gap nearby. Travelers seeking a way over Laurel Top Mountain via Porters Gap sometimes became confused about the gaps precise location. Maps, showed only one gap.. Porter.. but there seemed to be actually two. Travelers who made the trip up the mountain to the wrong gap, only to have to retreat and find Porters Gap, started referring to the wrong gap as False Gap. The name stuck. 

Bradley's View Photo spot
Peck's Corner Shelter: Privy and water. The Peck family received an early land grant in the area. ""Corner"" refers to a marker tree at the corner of two large state Grants. One to Moses and Henry Peck, the other grant to Benjamin and Elliot Peck. 
Eagles Rocks Photo spot. The name might typically be applied after a chance sighting of an uncommon number of eagles. In this instance, however, the name comes from a craggy collection of weathered rocks that to some resembles an eagle on a perch. 
Copper Gap 
Mt Sequoyah AT skirts summit. Named for the Cherokee chief Sequoyah, or Sikwayi (1760-1843) who was born of a Cherokee mother and a German immigrant father, a lieutenant colonel in George Washington's Indian Auxiliaries. A silversmith and painter, Sequoyah developed a written Cherokee language completely on his own, despite having no formal schooling and no ability to read English. Within 7 years, enough Cherokee people had learned to read the language that the Newspaper ""The Cherokee Phoenix"" was published. The sequoia tree is also named for Chief Sequoia. 
East Ridge of Mt. Chapman A native of TN and proprietor of Chapman Wholesale Drug Company in Knoxville, Col.David C. Chapman (1876-1938) is remembered as the father of Great Smoky Mountains NP. He was chairman of the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association, an organization that advocated the creation of the park, in 1931-1944. Later, he served as chair of the TN Great Smoky Mountain Park Commission, which led efforts to purchase land for the park. The mountain named for him had been called MT. Alexander, Old Black and The Black. It also had apparently been called ""Lumadaha"" from the first two letters of four men's names. (Lucien, Marshall, David and Harvey) They made up the word and passed it off as Cherokee. The named gain currency until a linguist exposed the hoax. 
Tri-Corner Knob shelter Privy and water.   Three counties, three crests, the Smoky Mountains ridgeline, and the Balsam Mountain transfers all converge here. Balsam corner, formerly called Big Swag in reference to the fridge gap here -- swag being another name for gap. The ""corner "" in the current name refers to a sharp angle in the county line. As well, the knob is said to resemble the shape of an 18th century tricorner hat! Sadly, Richard Lemarr passed away here in 2013 from hypothermia. 
I'm loving the Appalachian Trail Names book by David Edwin Lillard! It's giving me so much more to make my hike tied to the past history of the trail.   I highly recommend it!

According to her, both the creek now called Chestnut Branch and Mt. Clamberer were called “Old Mother” until the establishment of the park. Within a couple of years of the name change, the entire eastern chestnut forest was wiped out by blight.

Hot Springs NC 209 US25/70 parking lot.

Hot Springs had been a tourist destination even for Native Americans. Two settlers discovered the area in 1778 and by 1782 people were traveling here to experience the health benefits of the Springs. In the 1800’s the Warm Springs Hotel was built , a popular 350 room affair that burned down in 1884. It was replaced by the Mountain Park Hotel, during the construction of which a hotter spring was discovered. Marketers changed the resort’s name to Hot Springs. The new hotel had 200 rooms, a golf course and marble pools. It was leased by the federal government as a prison camp during World War 1. About 2800 German servicemen spent their war years here in the lap of luxury, entertain each other with music and games. When a rumor arose that they were to be transferred, the men poisoned their own water, hoping to make themselves too sick to travel. The scheme backfired, however and a few of the troops died. The Mountain Park Hotel burned down in 1920. It lives on, though, on a website devoted to its history, hotspringsnc.org. ---- Recommended places to stay are Elmers Sunnybrook Inn and the Hostel at Laughing Heart. I have stayed at the Mountain Magnolia Inn that is just beautiful and very expensive. It was the last available place to stay because of a festival that was going on at the time.

French Road River bridge Northbound hikers turn east through a gap in the guard rail right after crossing the bridge. One story names the river for a noted hunter named French. Others say it was named in the 1700’s by Europeans because it flows south toward what was then the French territories.  
Lovers Leap Rock, several rock outcroppings. The participants are different, the the story seems to always be the same. The legend here tells of a Cherokee maiden who threw herself off the mountain after her lover, Magwa was killed by jealous rival Lone Wolf.

This section of the trail skirts the Andrew Johnson Mountain named after President Andrew Johnson. Born into poverty in Releigh, NC in 1808 . The future president headed west in 1825, landing in Greenville, TN. After training as a tailor, he entered politics, first as an alderman, then mayor, state legislator, and U.S representative. He was elected to the Senate, then was selected as Abraham Lincolns vice president in 1864. A pro-Union southerner, he stayed with Lincoln after TN seceded. He became president after Lincoln's assassination , but was considered to many northerners to be too soft on the South during Reconstruction -- a perception that would lead to his impeachment by the House in 1868.

Big Bald Survey marker. Sometimes called Griers Bald for David Grier, a hermit who lived here in 1802-1834 after being rejected by a woman. He was once charged with murder, but acquitted on grounds of insanity. Friends of the victim found Grier and killed him.  Indians called the bald Sassenohla or white man referring to Grier. The Cherokee called all the southern bald Udawagunga. In Cherokee legend the balds were the domain of the Ulagi monster who would come down from the mountain and kidnap children. After the indians killed the monster, they petitioned the Spirit to keep the summits clear so they could keep watch for other Ulagus.

 Built in 1885 at the top of Roan Mountain (6367 feet ) by Gen. John Wilder, the hotel was the pinnacle of luxury. Local cherry and maple were used for furniture and paneling. Guests enjoyed golfing, bowling, tennis, horses and ballroom dancing. The dining room straddled the NC-TN state line: guests who wanted to drink alcohol sat on the TN side because NC was a dry state at the time. Oddly, the hotel contained only one commode for 250 guest rooms , although each room had it's own copper bathtub. Building such a hotel at the altitude today would be considered an ecological disaster. 
English and Scottish settlers likened the mountain ash trees in the area to their rowan trees back home. The spelling transformation was likely caused by the clipped voice pronunciation of the Scots. Hence “ Roan”. 
 In this area Is a gap called Engine Gap. An engine that one pulled TN logs though the gap to NC sawmills had been abandoned here

Jane Bald, big rock slab, views back to Roan Mtn. photo spot. dThe story of the name’s origin tells of a woman who died tragically here in 1870. Two sisters, Jane and Harriet Cook, had traveled across the mountains to visit their other sisters. While visiting, Harriet came down with “milk sickness”, an ailment contracted by drinking filk from cows poisoned by snakeroot. Awaiting Harriet’s recovery, Jane delayed their return over the mountain. But as winter approached, they decided they had best start home. The trip over the rugged mountains in the cold autumn proved too much for Harriet. She collapsed, and Jane went in search of help, entreating local residents to bring a wagon up onto the mountain to retrieve Harriet. They did, but she never recovered, she died at the age of 24. Jane whose valiant attempt to save her sister is memorialized in the bald’s name, lived some 79 years more, dying in the 1940’s.

Dennis Cove Rd, USFS 50 hostels parking In the early 1800’s a man known now only as Mr. Dennis came from NC to hunt here . He went back home to tell others of the plentiful game to be found. Soon hunters were flocking to “Mr. Dennis’s Cove. The name stuck. Dennis never actually lived in the area, but he apparently hunted here for many years. In this part of the country, a “cove” is a narrow valley leading into the mountain. A little farther north in WV, these are called “hollows”. West of the Appalachians, they are called “shut-ins”

Nick Grindstaff Monument Orphaned at the age of 3, Nick Grindstaff(1851 - 1923) developed self-reliance and ingenuity. On a trip to the West in 1876 he was robbed and beaten. Bad choices of business associates led to further financier losses. Grind staff decided he was better off alone. He became a hermit, spending 45 years alone on Iron Mountain. Sometime in 1923 , after neighbors noted that he had not been seen for some time, they went to check on him and found his body. His dog was so protective that they had to destroy it to reach Nick. The trailside monument that marks his grave was build from brick taken from Nick’s cabin fireplace. The inscription says “lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone.""

Looking at the schedule of events, I wish I was back there to celebrate with all the hikers who will be celebrating Trail Days. I’m looking forward to all the entries that will be sharing their own experience there! Happy Trail Days! Celebrate responsibly and have a wonderful time! 
 
Damascus is the 34th day on the schedule. I made it to Trail Days in 2014. My daughter came out to see me and we had a great time together though it was rainy and overcast the whole time. We stayed at Susie Montgomery’s ""Montgomery house"". It was very comfortable, a bit expensive. but lovely. We had the whole house to ourselves. . I hated to see Sharon leave after it was over. .

Then again I read about The Hikers Hostel that has been here since 1970""s and has catered to the AT hikers and cross-country cyclists. I stayed there in 2014 after completing 35 miles that I had skipped to get to the Trail Days with my daughter. The hostel was fairly new then and I am very impressed with all that has been done to make it even larger and nicer. 
 
Henry Mock was on his way to settle in KY in 1821 when he happened onto the confluence of Laurel and Beaverdam creeks. He decided to stay, purchasing and building a home an d a gristmill. The town that grew up around the mill was known as Mock’s Mill. In 1886, Confederate general John Imboden purchased tracts of the Mock family acreage. Surveying the mountains, he believed they contained vast deposits of iron ore and other minerals, and so named the place Damascus. He printed that it would become as well known as the Syrian capital. Unfortunately,the iron Imboden found on the surface was all there was. After the mountain logged of old growth, it was sold to the US Forest Service. The little town of Damascus is known to many hikers as the friendliest town on the AT, owing in part to its annual AT Days celebration. In 1997 it was designated Trail Town USA by the American Hiking Society.",,"Damascus, VA Resupply","May 19, Fri",0
 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565723,"HI.. Just read Vikings journal entries on Damascus and the Trail Days. It sounds like it was a fun time and that the weather was just right. He did mention a police watch. I don’t remember seeing any police while I was there in 2014. I hope that there were no “problems”. It does seem that the last few years have had more destruction to the trail. Trash is left behind, graffiti on the shelters. With so many more people going out to hike, it seems we are getting people who have no respect for nature. I sure can’t imagine that a thru hiker would be so careless. You have to love nature and respect it to accomplish a big hike like this!

Luther Hassinger Memorial Bridge parking lot. The span along the VA Creeper Trail is named for an early timber bar4on who harvested millions of board feet in this area. The history of the natural beauty in the Appalachians is one of irony. To much of this land was given up as valueless by the barons after they extracted its wealth and laid it to waste. They often disposed of it on the cheap to the federal government. Today, the landscape is treasured for it’s natural beauty. not just for the potential profit to be made from it. Yet, were it not for the enormous scale of exploitation by people such as Hassinger, the government would never have been able to assemble such huge parcels of public land.

A native of Philadelphis, a city just barely above sea level, Rogers has a mountain named for him at 5,729 feet is the tallest in VA. 
Thomas Knob Shelter Privy, water photo spot. Campsite ahead 0.3 ahead . Nerine and Thomas, who founded the Mt. Rogers AT club in 1960. 
David O. Thomas had deep roots in Washington County, Virginia. He was the fifth generation to live on the land where his home is located. His great-great-grandfather, John S. King (a veteran of the War of 1812), bought the property in 1831; but his 3 greats- grandfather, William King (veteran of the Revolutionary War and the Battle of King’s Mountain), had owned the property as early as 1810, only five years after the earliest settlers in the area had recorded the initial survey.
His parents operated the farm for 47 years while living in a log house built before 1820. David was born in this house on Feb 15, 1917. When TVA filled South Holston Lake in 1950, the log home had to be demolished; David used stone from that house for the chimney in his house.
David met Nerine Bower in first grade at Cleveland School, and said he knew from that time on that she would be his wife. She was not convinced until 1940, when he came home for Labor Day from his new job with the Census Bureau in the Department of Commerce in Washington, DC, and they decided to get married
Later David taught at Cleveland High School. He became the Vocational Agriculture instructor and reactivated the Holston Valley Chapter of the Future Farmers of America (FFA). He led the equipping and operation of the agriculture shop, which now bears his name as the home of the Cleveland Community Center.
He also led community activities such as classes for veterans returning from WWII; a local Farmers Club – which led to the organization of the Washington County Farm Bureau; a Community Club to help cope with the impact TVA was having on local residents; and the Cleveland Green Spring Wildlife Association. He completed course work for a masters degree in Agriculture from Virginia Tech.
After leaving teaching, David worked in various local companies including Lincoln Industries in Damascus, Sperry, Raytheon and the local Blue Cross office. David retired in Feb 1979 from his position as Benefits Manager for Univac in Bristol, TN.
In the early 1950s after the construction of South Holston Dam, David built a home using surplus building components from TVA. In 1988, he and Nerine replaced most of that structure with a log home carefully retaining the original rock chimney.
David, while holding office jobs, always helped his brother George run the family farm. After George died in 1981, he continued to raise beef cattle, tobacco, and a barn full of cats. But his best agriculture accomplishment was always a large garden that fed the family, provided food to preserve for the winter and supplied neighbors and passersby. Tomatoes were a specialty.
David was active in many organizations. He was a member and officer of the Washington County Historical Society, Inc. He and Nerine were active square dancers from the 1950s to the 1980s. He participated in the initial planning and re-enactment of the Over Mountain March to King’s Mountain.
David and Nerine always enjoyed hiking. In 1959, several people, including David, independently contacted the Appalachian Trail Conference to explore the possibility of establishing a trail maintaining club in southwest Virginia. An attempt to establish the club was delayed on February 22, 1960 when a group from the Roanoke Club along with potential members for the local club were delayed in their return from a hike on Whitetop Mountain due to snow. A week later on February 29, 1960, the club was organized at a meeting in Damascus. David was elected the first president of the club and continued to hold various offices until his death.
In 1992, the club along with the Konnarock Crew constructed a new shelter to replace Deep Gap Shelter. In order to comply with restrictions regarding the naming of structures for living people, a nearby point was named “Thomas Knob” and the new shelter was named the Thomas Knob Shelter in honor David and Nerine.
The shelter was dedicated on August 14, 1992. Those present for the dedication included club members, U.S. Representative Rick Boucher, Jefferson National Forest Supervisor Joy Berg, Mount Rogers National Recreation Area Ranger Steve Sherwood, and ATC representatives.
As one of several to speak during the dedication, David’s remarks illustrate his humble personality: 
""To some of you this may seem to be a dreary day, but to Nerine and me it is full of sunshine. Many people are born to insignificance—and we were—but today you have honored us and made us significant. We accept this with humility, pleasure and appreciation. We feel a little incredulous that we have been so honored today. During the past 32 years Nerine and I volunteered for jobs in the Club. We were happy to be doing them. It was reward enough to be taking part in the good work of the Mt. Rogers Appalachian Trail Club where so much is done in a light manner. We had no sense of work, only enjoyment. One of our greatest rewards was the friendships that developed, not only in the Club, but friends from Georgia to Maine, including our friends in the U. S. Forest Service, Virginia State Parks, and the National Park Service.""",,Thomas Knob Shelter,"May 24, Wed",0

Glade Mountain Early settlers here drew their water from a clear spring in the glade, an open space in a forest. They referred to the place as Glade Sprint. The town that grew up here was originally called Passawatomie Station for the rail station that opened in 1856. Passawatomie is thought by some to be a made-up word, but it may be a reference to the Pota Watomi nations, a name translated in the Chippewa to mean “people of the place of fire”. The Pota Watomi however, were native to the Great Lakes region

My hike will allow me to embrace my core being, and it will also be a tribute to Ian, each step of the way. There is also another dimension of tribute added to my hike, to honor the life of Jack Holden, a 26 year old hiker from Massachusetts who tragically died on a demanding hike in the Pemigewasset Wilderness of the White Mountains, on Christmas Eve of last year. “ I hope his pain and grief will lessen as he hikes the Appalachian trail.

The Cinch Mountains run through this area, beginning in TN and into Virginia. Two origin stories have been uncovered but neither seems very credible. in one, a hunter named Clinch is the first settler to explore here. In another, a local Irishman falls from a mountain ledge, breaking bones and is heard to cry ""clinch me!) A more likely source of the name is the appearance of the summits, which seem bent or chinch like the tips of nails protruding through wood.

I had injured my right leg and ankle in a fall on the trail. It took a year before I could hike without pain after three miles. To top that off, my left leg was crushed between my car bumper and grocery cart when a confused elderly woman drove into the cart.

Mile 634 – Pearisburg, VA: Less than a mile to walk from trail to town, Pearisburg is worth a visit. In town you’ll find lots of grocers for resuppply and every hiker’s favorite, an all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet!
 VA Capt. George Pearis, an officer n the Revolutionary War and one of the first settlers of this region, started a ferry service here across the New River in 1782. The town was named for him in 1808 when he donated land for the courthouse. New River once called Wood’s River after Abraham Wood, who explored the area in 1654 . This ancient river is said to be the second oldest on earth, only the Nile is older. It is an unusual river for such a major drainage in that it flows northwest on its way to the Mississippi .Legend says that people thought its northward flow must make it a new sort of river. Some claim that the river was named by Dr. Thomas Walker in 1750 for a man named New who operated a free here. Big Walker Mountain was named for colonial era physician and explorer Dr. Thomas Walker, of Albermarle County, who built a home called Castle Hill near Charlottesville in 1764. The house still stands today. n addition to frequent visits by Thomas Jefferson, Castle Hill has entertained other U. S. Presidents and historic figures including George Washington, James Madison, James Monroe, Patrick Henry, Andrew Jackson, Robert E. Lee, James Buchanan, Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. 
The Historic  Cemetery where Captain Pearis is buried, is passed by the trail here. The New River is crossed here in Pearisburg.
 Not far from Pearisburg, is Burkes Garden A long highland alley that was a hunting ground for the Cherokee and Shawnee, it is named for James Burke. The legend surrounding it's name concerns a hunting trip in which Burke is said to have ledBritish colonel James Patton there to hunt . According to the story, Burke killed a bear. While it was roasting, he dug up the potatoes he had planted the previous year. Col Patton, enjoying the effects of the good food and liquor, bestowed the name.

( There are lots of people with Scottish decent living here ) At one time it was thought to be the highest peak in the Eastern U.S. , then merely the highest peak in VA. By 1859 it’s official elevation had whittled down to 4,600 feet. Today its official height is listed at 3,870 feet Stone from Sharp Top was used in the construction to the Washington Monument.

Cove Mountain photo spot. Probably a descriptive name, given the character of the topography here, with so many deep recesses in the side of the mountain. It was formerly known as Luna Mountain, or Moon Mountain. But some maps of the early 1900’s are said to refer to the northern section as Luna and the southern end as Boatload (thought to be a derivation of a German surname) Other names refer to the entire mountain as Luna. The Cove Mountain Lean-to originally was the Marble Spring Shelter built north of here in 1960. It was moved to its current site in 1980 after James River Face was designated as a wilderness.

He decided to haul ten car loads up the slope at once instead of the typical three. Gravity was more powerful than the engine, however, and the load rushed down the hill out of control. The crew saved themselves by leaping from the train, which crashed into Cornelius creek, where it remained until 1940.

It comes from a furnace that supplied cannonballs for the Battle of Buena Vista near Monterrey Mexico in February 1847. Because the furnace commenced operations at about the same time the battle occurred, people began referring to it as the Old buena Vista Furnace. It operated until 1864 when it was destroyed by Union forces. The town of Buena Vista was founded in 1892 but there was disagreement over what the name should be. Buena Vista, or Green Forrest. Although many people preferred the latter, a land company had already begun selling lots under the name Buena Vista, so founders agreed to it. Present-day locals pronounce the name “bu-no “ vista.

Maupin Field Shelter The shelter built in 1961 is named for the Maupin family, who’s presence here dates to the late 18th century. The Maupins married into the Brown and Jarman families that settled in the area. The lean-to’s presence leads into another story. In 1973 the superintendent of the Shenandoah a NP decided to remove all existing lean-tos to make the park more primitive. Within a year all the log lean-tos were gone. Ed Garvey, then president of the potomac AT Club which maintains trails in the park, intervened, contesting that the shelters were essential for long distance hikers, whose packs were already too full of provisions to carry tents. His efforts saved the lean-roos that remain today. Between 1973 and 1983, the shelters were considered closed except in severe weather. Sins 1983 the shelters are again open.

Rockfish Gap, The original spelling was “Rockefish” which suggests a surname. Most likely it was corrupted by a scribe and now sounds like the Chesapeake area term for striped bass. The land near the gap and the river was called Rockfish in a 1728 land grant. The site is famous for a meeting that took place here in 1818at the Mountaintop tavern. which no longer exists. Twenty eight people, including former presidents Madison, Monroe and Jefferson and chief justiceJohn Marshall, gathered to decide whether the university of Virginia should be located in Lexington, Staunton, or Charlottesville.

Yes, please.
Waynesboro first settled in the 1730’s when Joseph Tease opened a tavern here. It became known as Teaseville. The city’s location along the South River and near the Rockfish Gap passage of the Blue Ridge, was a great attraction. The town was laid out in 1797 by James Flack and Samuel Estill, and rechristened Waynesborough in 1801 in honor of American Revolution general “Mad” Anthony Wayne. It was incorporated as a town in 1824 becoming and iron and steel producing center when the railroad arrived and earning a reputation for the manufacture of railroad cars.

 Lewis Mountain probably named for John Lewis, the settler in Staunton, circa 1740. In the 1930's shortly after the opening of the Shenandoah NP, a picnic ground here was designated for ""colored use""; when park officials noted that more than 4,000 African-Americans were visiting the park each year, Franklin Roosevelt's Interior Department had directed the creation of a ""colored campground"" to accommodate them. Even though it was segregated, the campground was seen by some to be an improvement of conditions. Most parks, including national parks, at that time were not open to nonwhites.

We all have our personal reasons. We all come off the trail with personal lessons and rewards. For me, it is a test of my strength and ability to face this great challenge. 

Crazy, in that we leave all the comforts of home, those we love and the security we try so hard to provide for ourselves. The world can be a dangerous place and we put ourselves into even more danger. It’s true. Why then am I counting the days before I begin?

Spring, No camping in Big Meadows clearing . Big Meadows is a vast open area in the central Shenandoah NP near the lodge of the same name . The history of the meadow is complex. It is thought to have begun with lightning-induced fire, which created an open field. Recovery species, such as berries, soon attracted deer and other game. The Indian tribes that summered in the high mountains may have maintained the clearing through controlled burns, creating a hunting ground. Later when white settlers began grazing cattle in the meadow, it was enlarged, often through a process called deadening, where trees are killed or deadened, by gashing their bark throughout the circumference. Deadened trees would be leafless but remain standing. The meadow, at one time much larger than than it is now, was a patchwork of pasture and gardens. Just before the creation of the park in 1937, the chestnut blight devastated the massive trees surrounding the meadow, making it even larger. For sometime after the blight , the meadow offered a haunting view of dead, leafless giants. left standing. Today, the meadow measures only about 300 acres:it’s kept open by the National Park Service for historic interpretation. Gradually, however the wetlands created by the meadows are drying up as the woodlands recover.

When it became clear that efforts to produce a profitable copper mining operation on Stony Man Mountain were futile young George Freeman Pollock of Washington DC convinced his father and his fathers partner in the mining company, to give him a chance with tourism. On Stony Man , Pollock created a summer camp for wealthy early 20th century urbanites who would stay for weeks on end in rustic summer quarters. In the evenings, there was entertainment, ranging from costume balls to bluegrass music. Pollock also became the first booster of efforts to establish Shenandoah NP, working tirelessly to gather political support. His book, Skyland, is a charming, outlandish tale of life on the mountain in the beginning of the century. 
 Today Skyland lives on as a family resort within the national park. Pollock originally called the place Stony Man Camp but was forced to change the name when he applied for a post office up on the mountain. there was already a Stony Mountain post office in the Shenandoah Valley.

Whenever a sheriff arrived to take someone in, the resident could claim jurisdictional immunity, claiming to be in of the other counties other than the one the sheriff was from.

Overlook, Mary’s Rock The popular legend is that it is named for the wife of Frances Thornton, one Mary Taliferro pronounced Toliver, A wealthy 18th century landowner, Thornton is said to have proposed to here here, and the couple returned each year afterward to camp on the “Great Pass Mountain” On one such trip, they climbed to the summit, and he named the rock there for her. When Francis died, Mary insisted that the land near the pass be included as part of her “dower” right to the estate. In those days a wife of a man of Thornton’s mess would not have automatic rights to the full estate. Many years later, Mary left her valley estate and moved close to the pass to live in a log house. From here she could look upon Mary’s Rock. The area was known as “Madame Thornton’s Quarter: during the last third of the 18th century. 
 A second origin story says that the sculptor William Randolph Barbee (1818-1868 ) who lived in Page County, named the rock for his wife Mary. When he died, William’s son Herbert made a bust of his father and placed it in the cemetery at his father’s grave, looking upward toward Mary’s Rock. It was Herberts intention to make a sculpture of Mary, but he died before completing the task. photo spot

Francis Thornton, who owned a large estate east of the fridge in the mid 18th century, and who was the devoted suitor in the legend of Mary’s Rock.. The vast area east of here was known at “F.T, Valley” from the initials Thornton on ce carved on a tree at the corner of his property. The gap was known as “Madame Thornton’s Quarter” in the late 18th century. 
 
Luray VA seen from the AT in Shenandoah NP, it is the site of the famous Luray Caverns. There are several stories about the origin of its name. One is that it was named for early blacksmith Lewis Ray, whose establishment was popular among early travelers. They referred to the place as Lew Ray’s. Another more plausible but less colorful explanation is that the name was bestowed by the family of William S. Massie, early settlers who hailed from Lurray, France.

Tuscarora Trail The name is a corruption of the Iroquois skaruren or hemp gatherers. TheTuscarora people broke from Iroquois and migrated to what is now NC. but there they faced hostility and disease from the white settlers, they moved north. Over the course of 90 years they eventually rejoined the Iroquois and the Five Nations of the Iroquois became the Six Nations. In the early 1960’s there was concern as to whether the AT could remain viable between Shenandoah NP and PA. On numerous occasions , landowners had closed the trail in VA. More troubling were the military facilities at MT. Weather in VA and Quirk Mountain in MD. So advocates planned this alternate route, a 255 mile trail with a southern terminus at the AT in Shenandoah NP and a northern terminus at the AT Dean’s Gap , near Harrisburg PA. 
 
Now that the AT is protected, the preservation of Tuscarora is the object of major efforts by the Potomac AT Club. Because much of the trail follow roads, the club is now working to relocate it. Until the late 1990’s, it was known as the Big Blue” south of PA, but it now carries the Tuscarora name over its entire length.

Bluff Trail ""The Bluff"", was the local name for Mt. Marshall, with its steep, rocky, south facing ledges. The Bluff Trail is listed in early guides as a way to avoid the steep climb over Mt. Marshall. AT history buffs are intrigued that this trail predates the AT but was not chosen as its route up Marshall. Some believe this is an indication of the intent of early trail builders to keep the AT above the crest line. We can't overlook the fact that AT buffs would choose a mountain named for a chief justice of the Supreme Court over which to hold an argument about intent.

The name origin is a matter of conjecture. In its earliest days, the place was known as “Hell Town” among the river men and packers who played here. It was also known as Luce and later Lehew, after Peter Lehew, who owned 200 acres here. Legend tells of a giant oak tree that stood in the public square. The oak was the “royal” tree of England. During the American Revolution, drill sergeants would holler for recruits to “front the royal oak,” Eventually just “front royal” .
 Six miles from Front Royal is Chester Gap. In 1736 a man named Chester began operating a ferry on the Shenandoah River at Riverton. Nothing more is known about him. 

Harmony Hollow, part of Front Royal: Although the origin of the name is lost, the site is noteworthy as the first land placed under conservation easement for the AT in VA. 

Deadening Nature Trail, not far from Front Royal. A ""deadening"" was an area where settlers cut a ring through the bark around trees so they would die. The trees would remain standing for a long time, but because they no longer sprouted leave, pasture grasses would grow into the newly created fields. In time all the trees in the deadened area would be cleared for firewood.

Harpers Ferry, WV High Street Robert Harper purchased land here fromLord Fairfax in 1747 and secured a ferry charter from the colony in 1761. In the 19th century, the town became a bustling manufacturing center and the location of the Federal Arsenal. It’s visually stunning location, at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, eventually was it;s undoing, as floods repeatedly destroyed the lower part of town. An act of congress in 1944 enabled the creation of “ The Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, which is a blend of private business and National Park buildings that preserve and interpret the past.

Harpers Ferry was the site of John Browns ill fated attempt to spark a slave revolt in 1859 and later, the gathering place of African-American leaders who went on to found the NAACP.

Goodloe Byron Memorial footbridge crosses the Potomac River from the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal into Harpers Ferry, WV. The bridge is named for the U.S. Congressman who did much to protect the trail, The trestle the bridge crosses dates to the 1890’s.
Rep. Goodloe Byron ( 1928 -78) led a fight in the US Congress to fund protection of the AT . He introduced a 1978 amendment to the National Trails System Act that authorized $90 million to purchase land for the AT corridor. When he died later that she year at the age of 50, his wife Beverly assumed his House seat and his commitment to the trails. The bridge named for him opened in 1985. 
 Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. George Washington had the idea of transporting goods via the Chesapeake Band Potomac River to the Ohio River when he founded the Patomack Company to build a canal alongside the Potomac. His attempt stalled, but President John Quincy Adams turned the first shovelful of dirt to start another attempt to link east and west in 1828. Completed in 1850, the canal locks between Georgetown in Washington DC and Cumberland MD> Boats on the canal averaged 4 miles per hour, pulled by mules. There vessels were only 8 feet wide but as long as 224 feet. The canal was barely opened before a railroad connected Baltimore and Pittsburgh . This competition, along with perpetual flooding closed the C&O in 1924. Politicians in the mid-20th proposed using the canal's tow path for an automobile park way. but advocates pushed for designation as a historic landmark. In 1954 , Supreme Court Justice William Douglas called the editors of Washington newspapers and challenged them to join him on a walk of the canal's entire184 miles. The attention the walk got created the momentum that led to the authorization of the canal as a national historical park, in 1971.

If you aren’t following the “TREK” sight, you are missing some wonderful and useful articles by hikers , and on equipment comparisons. Today, one article was on comparing tents. There are so many great tents out there that you could find the perfect one for your needs. I’m using my Big Agnes Scout 2 person, tent for next year. It was my third tent on the trail in 2014. My first “Go Lite” tent blew apart in high winds after 59 miles or so. I couldn’t wait until I got to a sports store so I picked up the only tent I could find in a small town. It weighted over 4lbs but got me through the week until my daughter was able to send me the Scout tent. I had lots of help putting up the monster tent. My hiking friends I met in the evenings called it the Taj Mahal . What a difference the Scout is. ! It’s just under 2 lbs. and goes up fast with my poles. An old fashion style “pup"" type tent.

Potomac River , Byron Memorial Footbridge, WV-MD border . North of river turn east on C&O Canal Towpath. The Blue Ridge Canal ,Over two years , beginning in 1827 , the 7 mile Bl;ue Ridge Canal was built to skirt the Balcony Falls Rapids. it was engineered by Col Claudius Crozzzet, who also built the famous railroad tunnel under Rockfish Gap in 1854 (and crossed the Alps with Napoleon). The canal ran along the north side of the river, where the AT crosses. In 1841, it was removed wit the intention of enlarging it, but new construction did not begin until 1847. For six years, boats on the James River were forced to run the Balcony Falls, many vessels and lives were lost. In 1870 , the community of Wayland Crossing, east of the AT , was renamed Crozet. No camping on AT section of towpath. 

The Potomac River said to be a Powhatan word, but there is no agreement on its meaning, Variations include Patowmeck and Patomack Creek. The south branch has been called Wappacomma or Wappacomo, with wadi meaning “white” and ahkamiku meaning “ground” The north branch was known as Cophongorooto or “goose river”. 

Pass under Sandy Hook Bridge (U S 340). Sandy Hook is the name of a village that grew up along the Baltimore and Ohil Railroad Line. The village was originally called by its land patent, “Keep Triest ” Sandy Hook illustrates how a single event in the lives of isolated, rural people can create a name that lives for generations. In the 1840’s . A teamster enroute to Frederick got stuck in a stretch of quicksand here, losing his horses. It’s been called Sandy Hook ever since. 
 Israel Creek named after Israel Friend who mined ore on both sides of the Potomac near the mouth of the Antietam Creek in the late 1720's In 1919 a fire at Savage Distillery caused the creek to burn all the way to the river. More than 650 barrels of of whiskey were destroyed. 

In the summer of 1859, abolitionist John Brown boarded here for a short time, and Union generals used Sandy Hook as a headquarters during the Civil War. When B&O freight yards moved to Brunswick in the 1880’s, Sandy Hook residents went with them. There is still a neighborhood in Brunswick called Sandy Hook. Other stories of South Mountain history are described in “The Blue Hills of Maryland” by Paula Strain.

From Keep Tryst Rd: Knoxville MD 1 mile west, Brunswick , MD 2.5 miles E . The early name of the land patent that would later become Sandy Hook. It was first called Keep Triest, then Triste. “Keep” is an archaic word for fortress: “tries” is evocative of the Italian city Trieste. The AT does not cross the road, but hikers detouring for provisions or a hot meal at Cindy Dee’s know it well. 

Weverton Rd parking lot 

As a highway and railroad construction engineer, Caspar W. Wever laid out Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC and served as superintendent of the National Road, which was authorized by congress in 1806 to run from Cumberland, MD, to the Ohio River. The road was completed in 1818 at Wheeling Va. (later WV) When Democrat Andrew Jackson was elected in 1828, he removed all Whigs from their government jobs, including Wever, who came to Washington County, a center for Whig sympathizers, and became superintendent of construction of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. He purchased property along the Potomac River and Israel Creek, hoping to sell riverfront property to either the B&O or the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal. He also had plans for an industrial center called Weverton Manufacturing. But there were few takers on the building leases he offered because of the predatory rents he charged. He sold off some of the land, including lots for the town of Weverton. He died in 1849. In 1852 , a flood ruined the wooden dams and industrial buildings he had built. In 1870 and 1877 . other flood damaged more buildings. The property was eventually sold to C&O, which razed the buildings.

Although Civil War journalist George Alfred Townsend called his estate ""Gapland"", for its location at the top of Crampton Gap, the state of MD chose Townsend's nom de plume Gath as the name for the state park. On a buggy ride in 1884 , Townsend was so smitten with Crampton ap that he bought a huge parcel of land here with the proceeds from his novels and syndicated columns. He built a house for himself and one for his wife, a social hall, library lodge, guest house, servants houses, stales and a tomb for his burial. It was a gathering place for the social elite of Washington, DC and Baltimore. Mrs. Townsend's house called ""The Hall"" contained 11 rooms. The library housed 5,000 books in 15 rooms. The 5-room guest house was called MT. Bath: the 4 room guest house was called "" The Lodge"" . Unfortunately, Townsend died penniless in New York City and was not interred in the estate's mausoleum. Only a wing of Gath Hall remind today, along with a memorial arch in Townsend, built to honor was correspondents, the only such memorial in the world.

Dahlgren Chapel was built by Madeleine Dahlgren in 1881, after she bought the South Mountain Inn for use as a summer home. Dahlgren , who was the widow of Admiral John A Dahlgren, who was commandant of the Washington Navy Yard during the Civil War and is credited with design improvements to the rifled cannon. She was also an author best known for South Mountain Magic, a collection of ghost stories gathered from mountain people. Her stories are illustrative of a time when South Mountain was a veritable wilderness:they feature Indian Ghosts who stalked children children, a doglike demon known as “snarly yow” and a pale woman who signaled approaching death to those who saw her., Somewhat modern for her time, Dahlgren nonetheless opposed suffrage for women. 
 

In the Appalachian Trail Names By David Edwin Lillard, I am seeing that there is a Plaque dedicated to Harold Allen. I can't find where it is located other than in Maryland. Maybe someone has seen it and can enlighten me. Allen was a leader in the effort to establish the Shenandoah NP in 1924 - 26. He has long been credited with penning the words known ny many AT Hikers 
 "" Remote for detachment, narrow for chose company: winding for leisure; lonely for contemplation. The trail leads not merely north and south, but upward to the body, mid and soul of man"". Recent research , however, has created doubt that the quote is Allen's. Not that he ever claim it. It was originally attributed to Allen by AT icon Myron Avery in a tribute to Allen published in the Potomac Appalachian after Allen's death in 1939. But the words also appear in an article written by Avery and published in American Forests magazine in 1934. Why would Avery attribute words to Allen that appear in an article written by Avery himself wrote? Avery was known as a hard-driving , tough-as-nails, bulldog, and he might have attributed the quote to allen because it was too flowery for his own taste. Or he might have been giving credit belatedly to his friend for helping him to write the 1934 article. 

After reading journals where the hiker is getting eaten by mosquitos, I’m looking for repellents that are more natural and work! On my previous hike, I found tea tree oil to be very helpful. I carried a bar of tea tree oil soap and washed my body and clothes with it. I didn’t get any bites, but they weren’t really swarming any place. I was also told that consuming “Stevia” helps make your body naturally repellent. I’ve started using it instead of sugar. Takes some getting used to the aftertaste.

Turners Gap US Alt 40 Restaurant. parking, In 1748 Robert Turner was appointed overseer for roads in the “Antietam Hundred,” the area west of South Mountain in the newly formed Frederick County. The jurisdiction had been drawn from acreage in Prince George’s County, In 1750, Turner purchased property that included the gap and the present day location of the Old South Mountain Inn. 
 Conventional wisdom is that this was the route of the British general Edward Braddock’s westward movement to protect Fort Cumberland during the Revolutionary War. In 1806, this route was designated the route of the National Road, which brought federal improvements. Stonewall Jackson and his troops used Turners Gap on September 10, 1862, enroute to the Cumberland Valley, Harpers Ferry and Martinsburg VA, now WV. Robert E. Lee also crossed that day to camp camp in Boonesboro, in the days before the Battle of Antietam. 

 South Mountain Inn . The original structure is thought to have been built by Robert Turner sometime around 1750 or 1760. It had 22 rooms to r3ent and blacksmiths on staff to shoe horses and repair wagons. Abraham Lincoln spent a night here on his way to be seated in Congress in January 1847. It was reportedly a favorite hangout of Saniel Webster and Henry Clay. During the Civil War, Clara Barton, founder of the Red Cross, came here on September 15, 18625, to attend the wounded from the Battle of South Mountain: she then went on to Antietam.

Most prominent i;n in Central VA. the Blue Ridge is a wide front of summits, ridges, and hollows. As it goes north, it diminishes to a single ridgeline that quietly disappears into the valley. Named for the abundant elk that once lived along the flat top of the ridge. Elk Valley Ridge was settled by Civil War deserters, weavers, and farmers in the late 19th century. By the early 29th century, illness from polluted water overwhelmed the community and people abandoned the settlement.

Black Rock Hotel history.. By the time Jacob D., Wolf, whose family gave its name to nearby Wolfsville, had opened the Black Rock Hotel here in the Mid-19th century, the name Black Rock was already in currency. The hotel prospered until it burnt in 1880. Shortly afterward, Wolf’s wife and daughter died. Despondent, Wolf moved to NY, where he grew wealthy marketing a formula for tapeworm medicine. In 19007, he returned to Wolfsville and rebuilt the hotel. It was considered fine accommodation, but was too remote to prosper once again. It fell into disrepair, then was destroyed by arson in the 1920’s 

Wolfsville Rd, MD 17, Sources disagree on which Wolf was the founder of Wolfsville. The local historical society credits David Wolf, SR. and gives the date for the settlement as 1828. Bu8t others credit Jacob Wolf as the founder, whom records show as postmaster in 1834. The name Jacob D. Wolf is also associated with the founding or Black Rock Hotel, but the history of this establishment spans from roughly 1870 to 1880. when the hotel burned, and to 1907, when Wolf is said to have rebuilt it. It seems a stretch that Jacob could have been old enough in 1828 to found Wolfsville and still have the vigor to rebuild in 1907. the founder of Black Rock is usually referred to as Jacob D. Wolf, perhaps the D was for David or perhaps he was a descendant of Jacob or David , or both. There also seems to be and interchangeable use of two spellings, Wolf and Wolfe. In any case, the road to Wolfsville was not built by Wolfs: it was was a well traveled old route from Frederick to Hagerstown thought to follow and even older Indian path.

Little Antietam Creek . Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1936, it is named for the nearby creek. The Indian Bulletin II of 1868 viewed as an authority at the time of its publication, gives the meaning of Antietam as swift river. The word is thought to be Algonquian origin, derived from ethane or ""current"". Its spelling has appeared variously through the years, including Odieta in 1721 and Antieatum inn 1730 . About 12 miles above its confluence with the Potomac River, the creek flows through the town of Sharpsburg MD, site of one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, known today as the Battle of Antietam. (Southerners call it the Battle of Sharpsburg) .

Devils Racecourse is a trail off from Raven Rock Shelter worth seeing if you have the time. There are similar boulder feels with similar names throughout the Appalachians. Remnants of the last ice age, when the frost heaves caused rock to crack and separate. Longtime AT volunteer and pathfinder Thurston Griggs offers perhaps the best explanation for the name here. He recalls a gibe delivered years ago by a fellow hiker: ""If the Devil were to construct a racecourse, this is the devilish kind that would result--- impossible to race on. 

Quoting ""Silver Spring Wanderer"" from his web page he says: "" We took a short side-trip to Devil's Racecourse, about half a mile off of the AT. On the way there, we passed Devil's Racecourse Shelter, which might be one of the saddest shelters I've seen. It is in pretty bad repair and the floor isn't remotely even. Apparently, its proximity to the road led to vandalism and graffiti. In 2010, it was basically replaced with Raven Rocks Shelter. Devil's Race Course, itself, is a field of boulders that covers up a creek. When you stand on the boulders, you can hear water running underneath.""

Pen Mar County Park parking photo spot. Situated on the Blue Ridge near MD’s border with PA, hence Pne Mar, the old park was opened by the Western Maryland Railroad in 1878 to create demand for rail service from Baltimore. It worked. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were a half dozen hotels and several dozen boarding houses here. Known as the Coney Island of the Blue Ridge, the park featured a dance pavilion, dining hall, money and goat cart and miniature train rides, and a Ferris wheel, as well as theater, carousel, penny arcade, roller coaster, and roller-Skating rink. Wives and children would stay for the summer: husbands could take the train out of weekends. In the 1920’s, when the majority of visitors arrived by car, the railroad leased the park to private operators. It fell into disrepair during World War II and was demolished by railroad employees. The new park here was dedicated in 1977.

MD - PA border, RR tracks Mason-Dixon Line. Originally known as the Mason and Dixon Line. It is named for surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, whose east west line through the wilderness and mountains created the border between MD and PA. The pair were already famous before they began the survey: they were picked for the job because of their renown . Descendants of William Penn and George Calvert, the original grantees of, respectively PA and MD had disputed the border since 1681. After a century of squabbling they agreed to commission a survey to determine the boundaries. Both agreed that their colonies would live gy the findings. 
 Beginning in 1763 Mason and Dixon placed milestones and every 5 miles, capstones to mark their transects. Anyone who has eve stumbled onto a Mason and Dixon stone in the rugged mountains, can’t help but be amazed by their efforts. Especially given how remote the western sections of those colonies were at the time. To smooth the way , a road was built to transport the pair’s provisions and equipment, and the two were accompanied by a battalion of local surveyors, lumberjacks, cooks, rodmen, and chairmen. Their boundary line long ago created an emotional dividing line line between North and South. (While they were at it, Mason and Dixon also surveyed the north-south line that now divides MD and DE)

Pine Grove Furnace Cabin Site is situated near the crossing of Toms Run, just south of where the trail crosses PA 233. and originally called the Bunker Hill Farm. Later, the Rupp House was built here, dating to the early 19th century. The Potomac AT Club leased the house during the 1930’s from Michaux State Forest. Despite being made of durable chestnut, the cabin had to be razed about 1990 after an unfortunate mistake by a well-meaning volunteer . Sometime in the 1940’s , a sealant had been applied top the logs inside the cabin. Unable to breathe, the logs rotted from their cores. 

Pine Grove Furnace SP, AT Museum parking . A charcoal furnace built here circa 1770 operated until 1895. The charcoal, made by piling wood in squares and burning it for many days, was used to fire iron furnaces. There is evidence of other industrial activity in the vicinity, including pits used to burn pine for the manufacture of pitch and tar for ships.

The name Cumberland is thought to derive from Cumberland County PA, which was named in 1750 for the duke of Cumberland, who was the son of George I and a military hero in England at the time. The AT follow the route of the Cumberland County Trail in Pine Grove Furnace State Park, PA. Between 1864 and 1940 , the South Mountain Railroad hauled iron ore along this corridor from nearby furnaces. 
 
Not far is Enola PA A popular myth was that Enola came from ""alone' spelled backwards and was named for the presence of a lonely telegraph tower here before the town was founded. Actually, the town took its name from the railroad station, which was named by Wesley Miller. a local farmer. He was approached by the Northern Central Railroad to sell 10 acres of land for a station. He sold the railroad the land, then donated 3 acres more. For this he was given the right to name the station. He chose Enola in 1888, for his daughter ffwho was 4 years old at the time. Enola Miller 1884-1962. She was named after a character in a book ""The Dangers of Darkness"" written by Isaac Kelso in 1850.

Darlington Trail Named for Bishop Darlington of Harrisburg PA, who maintained a trail in the 1950’s along the crest of the same name. This trail was used for the original AT route in this area over to the Susquehanna River. , Tuscarora trail northern terminus . 

Darlington Shelter There actually have been two Darlington Shelters. The first was built in 1956 by Earl Shaffer, known as the first solo hiker to walk the length of the AT. It is now abandoned about a half mile east of the current AT. The second was built in 1977 by the mountain Club of MD. privy, unreliable water 

Thinking about plastic bags as I dumped my trash today, I couldn’t help think how useful they are on the trail. I’ll be using and buying them all along the way in various sizes. What a wonderful product for hikers, decreasing the weight in our packs dramatically! Then I got to thinking about how they are folded and rolled . What an amazing machine it is that can do this. All so exact and tightly rolled. In my backpack, I use one for my sleeping bag. Various sizes for my clothing, food and personal items. They keep things dry and separated for an easy “find”. Just about everything gets a bag! Easy to replace at the resupply stops.",,Darlington Shelter,"Jul 11, Tue",0

It is an Iroquois word translated variously as “projecting rock” , “standing stone people “ or “People of the standing rock” According to the “Handbook of American Indians” , the word is reference to a standing stone in the river that was the object of reverence and to a tribe that lived near the mouth of the river. The tribes small village located on Duncan Island in the Susquehanna River was also known as Juanita 
Susquehanna River parking North end of Clarks Ferry Bridge, US 22/322 , railroad tracks. Conventional wisdom is that the word is derived from Sosquenhanne, from an unknown Indian language The word is said to mean “how muddy the river is” Other sources disagree not only on the origin but also on the character of the river. One claims it means “the long crooked river” another claims the name is derived from the word saskwibhamamg, meaning “ the place of the straight river. 
Clarks Ferry Shelter privy-water-tenting 
Clarks Ferry Bridge . Clarks Ferry was operated by Daniel Clark during the 1780's about 1 mile south of the Bridge. This is the sixth bridge that has spanned the Susquehanna River here. The first bridge was constructed in 1827-28 by the PA Canal Commission as an aqueduct. It was the first of five spectacular wooden covered bridges that carried the canal until 1913. The current bridge was built in 1925. 
PA 225 Fumitory Rock Named for the climbing fumitory, or ""Allegheny vine: which grows here along Peters Mountain . A member of the poppy family, the vine can grow to 12 feet long , it usually blooms in July, Despite its range from Canada to NC, it is found nowhere else on the AT.

Peter’s Mtn Shelter Privy-weak water -  The next seven miles the AT follows the Daupin-Pottsville Stagecoach Road To connect local mining operations a wagon road was constructed on Stony Mountain in 1840. Later the road was improved for stagecoach line from Dauphin to Pottsville. The town of Pottsville was named for John Pott, an iron ;maker and miller, he laid out the town in 1822. The town of Dauphin and Dauphin County were both named for the son of Louis XVI of France to honor French recognition of American Independence. The title of dauphin was given to the eldest son of the king of France from 1349 to 1830 The origin of the title is the dolphin on the family's coat of arms, thought to be chosen by the family because the origin of the word ""dolphin"" is Greek for womb--the shape of the dolphin The dolphin, or womb would symbolize the son who would be king. Today the AT follows this stagecoach road for 7 miles.

Force Flex and Curly are going to hike the Long Trail next year. Too much is happening at home for them and they are making the right decision for now. I hope to read their journal in the future and that they do come back to the trail again. 

Fleischman’s latest entry tells us of his singing adventure in Chicago. He and his friend from the Grantsburg Chorale were invited to join a group chorus to perform through Manhattan Concert Productions, Maybe we will be lucky to hear him perform for us on the trail ! 

Class Act is shaping up for the hike even with his VERY busy life right now. His youngest son is getting married or may have gotten married since this last entry. Life goes on around us especially while we are on the trail. It makes for another challenge to deal with. 

Easy Gone is another hiker returning to the trail in 2018. It will be interesting to see what he carries this time. I know that I have reduced my pack weight in half from the 2014 pack I began with.

Reading David Rouner’s preparation entry, I see that he is bringing his his dog Abbie with him on his practice hikes. I don’t know how many bring along their pets. It was nice seeing them on the trail when I did my first hike. I wonder if it changes them like it changes us. 

Checked in with Aurelia to see if she is preparing for the hike. I get concerned when I don’t see anything posted from our classmates.

First, I wasn’t expecting to get off the trail in Virginia. I felt that I had let myself down by not finishing. I fell into the hiker depression that was the worst part of all. It took a year for my leg to heal and during that time, there were days I had to force myself to smile. Looking back, it wasn’t fair to my family or Rick. He is a very patient man. Then again when my leg was crushed in 2016, I fell back into that slump. Now that I am able to hike longer hikes again, and the hike seems a reality, I am feeling the excitement build up again.

Great Walk the name given to this trail near Fox Gap may refer to the Walkers Purchase, when Leni-Lenape Indians granted to a group of earlier settlers as much land as they could walk in a day The settlers covered a roughly 20 square mile area from the Delaware River to near Smith Gap The Leni-Lenape felt they had been cheated, however because the settlers had scattered themselves throughout the region rather than all starting from the same place This led to several battles here over a number of years. 

Kirkridge Shelter Privy Water The church retreat is named for the nearby Kirkridge Retreat House. Kirk is Celtic for “church”, and the ridge was added because of the location on the Appalachian ridge. The shelter was built around 1948.

Delaware River - Lehigh Gap opened in 1926 and original known as the Skyline Trail. 
 
Delaware River Originally called the Zuydt or South River by the Dutch, the name Delaware was transferred from Cape Delaware, now known as Cape Henlopen. Delaware was named for Thomas West, baron de la Warr, the colonial governor of VA in 1610-18. Like many colonial governors, he spent less than a year in the colony assigning his duties to deputy governors. For four years he enforced martial law in Jamestown, which was then the largest city in the New World. His title means “Lord of the Weir” The war “weir” itself is largely lost to contemporary use. Its modern usage generally refers to a fenced enclosure set in water for the purpose of catching fish. It can refer to a dam used to divert water our raise its level, or to all the land in the watershed of the weir—the likely origination of Delaware,

Holly Springs Trail 

Backpacker campsite Off the trail is the Garvey Spring.  Named for Edward B. Garvey (1914-99) an AT legend for his activism and writing. In an unsubstantiated but quintessentially Garveyesque story, he once wrote to the At Conference to complain about the scarcity of water sources along the trail. So many springs were located too far from the trail, many with no signs to Guide hikers to the water. NH hikers soon blazed well marked trails to the water to Garvey would have no trouble finding it. At this one, they made it even easier by painting a rock to make a sign at the side trail to the spring. The top line caught his attention ""Garvey"" The bottom line pointed the way ""Spring"". 

Sunfish Pond The southernmost glacial pond on the AT in the 1960s. Supreme Court justice William Douglas and others fought to save it from being turned into a power plant reservoir .

Losing gear or money was a concern of mine on my last hike . It has already crossed my mind now before I go back to the trail.

He had to hike back 5 miles and find a note that a father and son had the wallet and knife . He had to hike 5 miles back to Gatlinburg to retrieve his things. Trail magic comes in many forms.

Greenwood Lake 2.0 Originally known as Long Pond , it was dammed in the 1760s to provide water for the iron industry at Long Pond Iron Furnace which operated from 1766 and 1882. The dam was enlarged in 1836 to provide water for the Morris Canal, which lifted coal laden barges from the Delaware River and floated them through the highlands to the Atlantic. That same year the name Greenwood Lake appeared. No one knows exactly why the name was chosen; it might have been a marketer’s description of the beautiful green woods that surround the lake. Greenwood Lake became a popular resort in the mid 19th century.

Its timber was harvested and over the years, it was cultivated as a potato farm. . The area surrounding the mountain was owned by the Dutch, and the mountain is presumed to have been named for a man named Hosner.

Bear Mountain State Park - Harriman The Harriman story is an important part of the history of not only the AT but of land conservation in America. After his death, his wife continued his goal by donating 10,000 acres to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission The first 6 miles of trail established specifically for the new AT were built here between the Ramapo River and Fingerboard Mountain in October 1923 . By January 1924, 20 miles of the trail were completed all the way through the park.
Anthony Wayne Recreation Area of Harriman Park was named for revolutionary general Mad Anthony Wayne, who received his nickname for his unconventional strategy to capture the fort at Stony Point, On July 15th 1779. Under cover of darkness, oe group of colonial troops crept into the British Fot and took positions, then been shouting ""the fort it ours"" while commanding the ""captured"" British to remain in their quarters. The startled British confused and cute off from assistance, dressed themselves to defeat. This allowed a much larger force of armed continental troops to enter the for unimpeded.

Fawn Trail origin is unknown, but the name appears on the first trail map of Bear Mountin-Harriman State park printed in 1920.
Catskill Mountains.  The Dutch called the mountains Katsbergs, owning to the presence of mountains lions, The name Catskill originally identified a creek flowing from the hills called Katerskills. It's translation from the Ditch is ""tomcats creek"". 

Hessian Lake It was formerly known as Bloody Pond because bodies of dead Hessian mercenaries hired by the British were put into the pond after the British attack on Fort Clinton in October 1777 during the Revolutionary War. In remembrance of the soldiers, it became known as Hessian Lake early in the 1800’s. It was also known informally as Highland Lake for a time in the 19th century and earlier it ws named Sinnipink by Indians. The lake is no longer completely natural, it ws enlarged by the installation of three dams in 1914. 

Bear Mountain Inn Notably is the meeting place of AT planners in 1923, including Benton MacKaye. whose article proposing the trail is credited with launching the movement to establish and protect it. The Inn was built in 1915 of native stone.

Bear Mountain Bridge, Completed in 1924, and at the time was the longest suspension bridge in the world. at 1,600 feet. It is a national engineering landmark. The bridge is also the low elevation mark on the AT or only 176 feet above sea level. It was privately built and maintained by the Harriman family until 1940 when it was sold to the sate of NY. Iona Island. The indians calle the island Monahawogh, a variation of Manhattan, which means ""Island of the Hills"". Most of it's 118 acres are rocky, only 40 acres are suitable for cultivation. After it was acquired by Stephan's Van Cortland in 1683, the island became known as Salisbury, then Shelby' . Later ames included Weyant's Island and Beverages Island. It was named Iona by CW Grant of Newburgh, who bought it in 1849 and grew apples, pears and grapes here. Grant had quite an operation reportedly his company produced the majority of fruit grown commercially in the country at the time  The ""Iona grape"" was once grown here. Iona refers to Grant's Scottish heritage. Iona refers to Grant's Scottish heritage. Iona in the Hebrides, is the ""Cradle of celtic Christianity"". and burial place of Scottish kings.  In November 1864 Grant hosted a horticultural convention here, but getting people to the island turned into a fiasco. Their steamship never arrived at its Manhattan port so guests went upstream by train and boarded a ferry. But the ferry ran aground so they hiked to another spot to be rowed across the Hudson to the island. A speech given by Horace Greeley at the gathering advocated the established of an Adirondack preserve to save the NY forest which was being logged out of existence. Iona later became a private resort, then a public park. In 1899 the US Navy bought it for munitions assembly and occupied the island until 1951. In the 1960's Iona was acquired by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. but because it is a winter sanctuary for bald eagles, plans for a recreational site here were abandoned. 

Anthony's Nose .. is such an interesting geologic formation and is worthy of many topymic legends. Here are a few it might be named after . Rio Saint Antonio, this is what a 16th century Portuguese sailor namedEstevan Gomez christened the river that would become known as the Hudson. Giving credence to this origin is the fact that the village of Manitou, just north of Bear Mountain Bridge, was formerly known as St. Anthonysville. Other sources claim the nose was named for Mad Anthony Wayne, the Revolutionary war general who captured the fort at Stony Point in 1779. But this theory is undermined by a letter from Lord Sterling to George Washington written in 1776 on the subject of the Hudson Highlands fortifications. It says in part ""Ft. Montgomery is situated on the west bank of the river which is there about half a mile broad and the bank one hundred feet high. On the opposite shore is a point of land called Anthony's Nose, which is manu hundred feet high, very steep and inaccessible to anything but goats our men very expert in climbing. The most colorful story comes from Washington irving's History of New York, which claims the feature is named for Anthony Van Corlear or Anthony the Trumpeter, one of Henry Hudson's crew members who had a giant nose. The nose was said to have reflected sunlight so fiercely that the glare once killed a sturgeon on the Hudson that became supper for the crew. 
Mile 1403 – Fort Montgomery, NY: One point eight miles off trail, you can eat and resupply here.  Mobile Market and Chestnut Mart are small markets.
Hudson River, Fort Montgomery, NY Built to defend the Hudson River in 1776. Richard Montgomery was born in Ireland in 1736 into a wealthy family: he joined the British Army in 1756. After the French and Indian War , and after being passed over for a promotion, which he felt he deserved, he left Britain for NY. He arrived in 1772 and married into a landed family , the Livingstons. He was appointed to serve in the Provincial Congress in 1775. 
during the war he recommended the famous fortification of the Hudson, a 1500 foot chain stretched across the hudson to prevent British invasion. Montgomery was appointed to the rank of Brigadier general in the Continental Army, after victories in Canada including the siege of Montreal. He was killed trying to take Quebec City. His name is widely associated with place names in the eastern U.S.
When Henry Hudson, sailing for the Dutch West Indian Company, looking for the northwest passage to Asia, reached what is now Albany in 1609 , he knew he had not found the passage.  He did, however, find a beautiful landscape, which he suspected was ripe for mineral exploration. There is a disagreement over the origin and meaning of the Indian name for the Hudson Some say it was named Nuhheakunnuk  Algonquian. meaning ""great waters constantly in motion"". Others say it was the Hahigans who called it Mahikannituk, which means ""tidal river of the Mahicans"" that named it. As well Portuguese salon Estevan Gomez, in the early 17th century, dubbed it the San Antonio. The Hudson's steep cliffs and tides characterize the river as a fjord, the only one on the AT. 
Constitution Island the patriotic name actually refers to the British constitution. It was bestowed to recognize th 18th century struggle to achieve a constitutional government for the colonies under the crown of England. A fort was built here by colonists in a 1775 effort to gain control of the Hudson River  In 1778 an iron chain was erected to span the river from Sterling Iron Works to West Point. Each lil was 2 feet long and weighed 150 lbs the links were floated into the river on logs A similar chain between Fort Montgomery and the easter shore of the river was broken by the British The Sterling one was not tested The island was formerly known as Martelaer's Rock Island for a french family that lived there. 
Continental Road build in 1779 by continental troops.

Old Highland Turnpike paved. Private road developers, once created toll roads to connect to remote villages in the Highlands region, among them North and South Highland. They hoped to make a profit transportation links. Most lost money because fees collected from travelers through the mountains could not defray road maintenance and operating costs. 

Franciscan Way Graymoor Spiritual Life Center Hikers can tent on lawn. In 1909 this became a Franciscan friars home where they erected St Chrisophers In to provide food and shelter for the homeless nomads of the highway, ill in spirit, discouraged, hungry and penniless. For many years the friars offered meals to AT hikers and allowed them to camp under a covered pavilion. The friary is still a neighbor to the AT, 

Nearby Butterfly Meadow one of the many place names bestowed by AT hikers and activists. Apparently John Yrizarry wandered into the 4 acre clearing on a summer morning in 1992. He identified twenty fie butterfly species here, the field is now kept clear for butterfly habitat. 
Breakneck Ridge is the north portal of the Hudson Highlands (1220 ft) It was formerly known as ""Broken Neck Hill"" attributed by some to its jagged cliffs. But a story that ties the name to adjacent Bull Hill is livelier and just as credible. Apparently a wild bull once roamed the area, trampling crops and creating general havoc among the locals. Farmers with pitchforks charged the bull over what is now Bull Hill and up the ridges, where it fell and sustained the broken neck that killed it. 

I see there are several “loop” trails that cross the AT along the way. Rick and I took a loop hike today . It was very pleasant though very humid.

Wiley Shelter Built in 1940 with assistance from William O. Wiley of the Tramp and Trail Club of NY. The Duell Hollow Brook just beyond the shelter is named for a Quaker family that settled in the region in the 1730's.
Not far from Wiley Shelter is Dover NY. The most likely theory is that it was named for the chalk cliffs of Dover to England in recognition of the large limestone and marble deposits in Dutchess County. 
Dutchess County Named for the Duchess of York, Mary Beatrice, who in 1671 married James Stuart the duke of York. Stuart was the younger brother of King Charles II. After England took the colony from the Dutch, Charles gave it to James calling it New York, after James's title. James became king when Charles died in 1685. Dutchess County was formed in 1685 as one of the first twelve counties in the new colony.

 Bulls Bride Road derives its name from both the bridge and village of the same name.

The name comes from the Bull family, which had an iron furnace, gristmill and sawmill nearby . Jacob , a Quaker, Bull refused to serve in the Revolutionary War and was taken to court for High treason because people thought he harbored deserters and loyalists at his inn. He was released from jail in 1778. The second bridge built there in 1842 was a covered bridge.

Mt. Easter Road Part of the Easter-Mine Sharon grouping in which the names are more associated with separate peaks than they are with the distinct mountains. No pre-depression era references to the name Easter have been uncovered. leaving many to speculate that the name emerged during Civilian Conservation Corps activities in the 1930’s It’s the kind of name that invites conjecture. One imagines a remote CCC work camp, men separated from their families, a binge of drinking and card playing then the redemption at a memorable sunrise Easter services on the summit.

Mohawk Trail view Photo spot Many of the trails in the CT Blue Trail System are named for Indian nations. Although the area was never inhibited by Mohawks, they are known to have come here on hunting excursion from NY. But the name Mohawk here is meant to be more evocative of frontier days than a historical reference to the Mohawk tribe. 
Barrack Mastiff Plateau  Barrack Mountain. It is impossible to investigate one of these two place names without the other, because various researchers have assigned different meanings to the word ""barrack"" in each name. There are a couple of theories about the names origin from a couple of sources. According to one theory Barrack Mastiff Plateau is the northern end of Wetauwanchu Mountain and the name is a combination of two Dutch words Mtiff mining ""steep high cliff"" or ""hill and barrack, meaning loosely translated a haystack with a wooden cover that slides up and down poles. So the name roughly means Haystack Mountain Another source claims that barrack is a derivation of the Gaelic word for pyramidal, There is agreement that the Wetauwanchu is derived from wanchu for ""hill"" or ""mountain"" and wetau, for ""wigwam place"" But the meaning changes in the context of Barrack Mountain. Here Barrack is said to derive from the German word for dump, barrack, and the mountain name to come from an old hermit who lived there in a dumpy shack. Other sources say a farmer named Barrack once owned the property that included the mountain. 

Warren Turnpike Thought to have connected to Falls Village Warren following the Housatonic River to Cornwall Bridge, then up the mountain to Warren. . It alternately was known as Seven Crossings Road because it crossed the railroad tracks seven times. It also was called River Road along various stretches, and the name eventually referred to the entire length. Like Warren , NH This CT town was named for Admiral Warren of the British navy.

Falls Village located in the town of Canaan, this village was formerly called Canaan Falls and Housatonic Falls: both are references to the Great Falls of the Housatonic River, which are visible from the AT on the edge of town. Originally a settlement that grew up near the lumber, then iron, processing mills, Falls Village still contains remains of iron furnaces and well as luxurious homes built by the villages prosperous citizens during the heyday of iron in the 18th century.  At one time there was another falls Village, on the west side of the Housatonic in Salisbury. For a time, the village in Canaan on the east side was called Falls Village in Canaan, to distinguish it from Salisbury's Falls Village. In the mid-19th century, planners had the idea to make the entire Falls Village area into a major industrial enter Locks and channels were built to bypass the falls and rapids in hopes of making the Housatonic navigable to Pittsfield. There were also plans in pre to connect the river too the Erie Canal in NY. Adequate financing for this project never materialized, however, and what was built ws placed by leaks. Salisbury's Falls Village eventually disappeared. In 1912, the Berkshire Power Plant was constructed and the river was dammed just north of the falls in order to channel the water through generators.

Housatonic River The conventional wisdom is that the word is derived from the Algonquian word Wuss-adene-uk, meaning “beyond the mountain place” This is the river that flows from beyond the rocky place. There as at one time a Mohegan settlement near Great Barrington, MA and some sources claim the name referred to this settlement and was then transferred to the driver. Spellings by Europeans included “Wesbenhook, “Awoostenok, “Ansotunoog” and “Ousetonuck”A competing theory is that the name is derived from Dutch and that it was the Mohegan's use of the Algonquian twang that led settlers to believe it was an Indian Term. The Dutch derivation theory may be true. ""Wesbenhook"" which appears on early maps, translates to ""west corner or nook: the river is on the west side of the mountains.  Mt Prospect

Greylock was the summer home of artist Ellen Emmet Rand and her husband William. they owned Hamlet Hill Farm here for about 50 years, until Ellen’s death in 1941. born in 1876 in San Francisco, rand moved with her family to NY in 1884 after the death of her other. After studying art in Boston, she had successful one person shows while still in her early 20’s , including one at Boston’s Copley Hall, where only James Whistler, John Singer Sargent, and Claude Monet had had such exhibits. She returned to NY , operating a portrait studio in Washington Square. Her portraits were in high demand, she completed about 800 in her career. She married Willam Rand and raised three sons, living and painting primarily in Ny but spending summers at Rand’s View.

Billy Forsyth is the sone of the family that owned this property As a teenager in the 1960s , Billy cleared this site to camp and enjoy the solitude. he family had originally referred to the place as Billy's Campsite. but the name was changed so as not to attract hords of campers. ""Billy's View is an appropriate name, the site offers splendid prospect on Salmon Kill valley from Wetauwanchu Mountain.

AT on US 44 

AT on Cobble Rd Salisbury CT. Conventional wisdom holds that the village was named or the cathedral city in Wiltshire, England. The name dates to 1738. Although the dutch settled the area in 1719 , English settlers surveyed the village in 1732. According to one story, one of the settlers was the son of a man from the English city. A colorful alternate theory claims that it was named after a Mr. Salisbury sentenced to be hanged at age of 100 for dragging his servant girl by a horse. (he was given a reprieve. ) 

Mile 1499 – Salisbury, CT: Ms. Maria Macabe and Vanessa Breton offer low cost bedrooms and showers for a night. The town has very limited resupply but several restaurants.

Undermountain Road, Parking and privy. Also designated CT Route 41 . The name refers to the road’s construction, which tucked the roadbed so far into the mountainside that it’s practically underneath it. The 2.7 mile trail, blazed by farmer and trail volunteer Ned Anderson, departs from Undermountain Road and terminates at Paradise Lane Trail.

Bald Peak Trail which leads to a Mt Riga-area peak, illustrates a common occurrence in naming evolution. Originally called Ball Peak, it was mistakenly labeled and Mountain by US Geographical Survey cartographers Once on the official maps the erroneous name achieved currency and eventually official status. 
 
Ball Brook Campsite Named for David Ball, who operated a metal forge here beginning in 1781. The area is still known by some as Ball’s Forge.

Bear Mountain Road A former charcoal road that led to a blast furnace at Forge Pond, also known as South Pond. 
 
Bear Mountain, rock observation tower photo spot Because the area’s last bear was shot in 1821, speculation is that the original name for the mountain was “bad” derived from its denuded condition after fire or logging. Thanks to contemporary habitat protection and wildlife management, practices there are once again black bears roaming the area. In 1885 Bear Mountain was erroneously thought to be the highest point in the state. 
 
Bear Mountain Monument First erected in 1885, by Robbins Battle of Norfolk, CT. the original monument now damaged was a pyramid of stone with a bronze ball atop of it. A monument tablet lists the mountain’s height at 2354 feet and calls it the highest point in CT. It is in fact the highest point on a mountain that’s entirely in CT. The highest point in the state is on the south slope of Mt. Frizzle 2380 feet, the summit of which is in MA. 
 
Trail to Mt Washington Rd The smallest town in MA was know originally as Taghconic Mountain, the mountains here being part of the Taconic Range. It’s earliest inhabitants, were Mahicans who had been forced from the Hudson Valley by the Mohawks and later the Dutch. The first whites to settle here were Dutch traders from NY who began to make permanent homes here in the 1690’s. The lord of the manor at the time was Robert Livingston, Dutch by birth, but the son of a Scottish Presbyterian minister who had been exiled to Holland. When, in 1755 he sent a armed party to collect the rent owed hi by English settlers, a skirmish erupted in which William Race was killed. Later Livingston’s henchmen burned six English homes. After the Revolutionary War, the town was incorporated as Mt. Washington one of the first places to honor the victorious war general.

Sages Ravine Campsite Simeon Sage founded the Sage Iron Company on the Ct side of the border here in the 19th century. When an iron forge opened nearby, the settlement became known as Sage’s Forge, even though the Sages did not operate the forge. When the forge was purchased by John D. Joyce, the settlement was called Joyce’s Forge. The ravine however, is still known as Sages Ravine.

Sheffield Egremont Rd, Shays Rebellion Monument ,Daniel Shays served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary but quit when soldiers were not paid. In 1786 , as a Berkshire County farmer during a severe economic depression, he led a local revolt demanding lower state taxes and end of debtor prisons. A group of some 800 protesters descended on the county courthouse, causing enough disruption to stop judges from issuing foreclosures. Shays then led an attempt to seize the arsenal at Springfield, but a state militia paid for by businessmen and landowners put the rebellion down in a battle of Sheffield Plain, site of the monument. Shays and others were tried , but Shays was pardoned in 1788. The episode highlighted the need for a stronger central government, and led in part to the Constitutional Convention of The monument was made of granite from Goodale Quarries in Sheffield and engraved by James Tully of Rutland, quarry superintendent at the time. Nearby Hubbard Brook was named for Rev. Jonathan Hubbard, the first minister of the Sheffield Congregational Church, who owned land near the brook in the early 18th century.

 Beartown State Forest. Two origin stories tell of men attacked by bears on the mountain. One man armed only with a pocketknife for protection had an arm mauled and half late. Tut with his other arm and his teeth, he managed to open his pocketknife and cut the bear’s throat. Another pioneer from the town of Lee, supposedly killed a bear here using only a knotted rope. Another story of the Beartown name recalls a giant black bear shot there in 1857. In addition to man eating bears, the mountain was said to be rife with wolves that harassed area farmers. The mountain was also the longtime home of Levi Beebe, know as Beartown Beebe, who purchased 2000 acres here in 1850, opened a sawmill and later developed a weather forecasting system so accurate that farmers throughout New England relied o his forecasts. Beebe wrote a pamphlet, Meteorology: How to Forecast the Weather for Each Season, for All Time and in All Parts of the World, published on January 1, 1892.

Fernside Road / Jerusalem Road Fernside Road story goes that after the demise of a Shaker Community in Tyringham, MA. Dr Joseph Jones moved to the former settlement in 1874 . He opened a hostelry and asked one of his visitors to suggest a name. The guest reportedly said, “You have ferns growing all over this mountainside. Why not call it Fernside”? Jones agreed and had the rooms decoded with green fern design wallpaper. The road was named for this popular boardinghouse, which is still standing, although it’s no longer a hostelry.

Zenas Crane (1777-1845) , founder of the Crane Paper Co, is a much more notable figure in the town’s past. He came to Dalton from eastern MA, where he had learned the paper-making business. In 1801 he built his first mill along the Housatonic River .

MA 8 Cheshire , MA, Originally settled in 1766 by Rhode Islanders, this town was for a tie called New Providence, After it was charted in 1793, it was renamed for Cheshire, England. One of the more famous town exports was a 1,235 pound round of cheese, sent to President Thomas Jefferson at the White House, on New Years Day 1802. The Cheshire Mammoth Cheese was the idea of John Leland, a MA native who had lived for a time in VA and became accounted with the future president. Leland later settled in Cheshire. On July 20th 1891, curds were collected from every local cow. By December, the barrel shaped cheese was on its way, first transported by sled to the Hudson River, then by boat to NY City, and then on to Washington DC. The gift was a political act: in the accompanying note the people of Cheshire wrote. “the cheese was procured by the personal labor of freeborn farmers with the voluntary and cheerful aid of their wives and daughters, without the assistance of a single slave.” Jefferson skirted this issue in his acknowledgment saying the cheese “presents an extraordinary proof of the skill with which those domestic arts, which contribute so much to our daily comfort, are practiced by the citizens of Cheshire”. 
Cheshire Harbor Trail was once a safe haven, or harbor for runaway slaves,

Adams MA Settled by Rhode Island Quakers in 1762, this town was first know as East Hoosuck, later East Township. It was renamed in 1778 for Samuel Adams, Revolutionary war leader, signer for the Declaration of Independence, and governor of MA. In keeping with the American tradition of commercializing history, Adams is now better known by the identification given hi by marketers; “brewer, patriot”..

Rockwell Rd/ Summit Rd Born in 1844 in Pittsfield, Francis W. Rockwell as appointed to fill the unexpired term of George D. Robinson, who resigned when elected governor in 1884. Rockwell was re elected to Congress three times. The road was named for him to honor his service as a member of the Greylock Reservation Commission in 1898-1926 

Mt. Greylock, highest peak in MA monument and photo spot An early 20th century storybook promulgated the tale of Chief Greylock, a marauding warrior who would retreat to this mountain after his attacks on European settlers. But the supposedly Indian name seems rather English. One of the earliest uses of Greylock for this peak comes from the book, Scenery of Massachusetts, published in 1824 “During that season the frost attaches itself to the trees, which thus decorated, it needs no great stretch of the imagination to regard as the gray locks of this venerable mountain” Grelock has inspired such noted waters as Thoreau, Hawthorne, an Melville. The view of Greylock from Melville’s home in Pittsfield is said to have inspired his tale of the great white whale. 
The Hopper A hopper is a cirque formed by small glaciers that preceded the main sheet of ice the covered the region during the last ice age and remained after the main sheet retreated. Snow pushed down these smaller glaciers, eroding topsoil and breaking off chunks of rock as it melted and sank forming a deep steep bowl where once there had been a mountain. The steep bowl in what is now Mt. Greylock Reservation resembles a grain hopper.  Hopper Road was constructed to ford Money Brook and go through the Hopper. The route was laid out by pioneer farmer Almond Harrison circa 1800. In 1830 Williams college students extended the road to the Greylock summit and built the first observation tower were. According to the Federal Writers Project the Civilian Conservation Corps developed the road into the Hopper Trail  
Nearby is Bousquet Ski Area Located on Yokum Seat Mountain, the property for this ski area belonged to Clarence J Bosquet, who allowed the Mt Greylock Ski Club to use and clear his property for skiing. 

Thunderbolt Trail, Bellows Pipe Trail Thunderbolt Ski Trail was made by thirty miles from the Civilian Conservation Corps working on the trail in August through December 1934. using 300 lbs of dynamite Oran McCarthy , a member of the Greylock Ski Club, suggested the name because the trail reminded him of the rollercoaster ride at Revere Beach north of Boston. The trail was the site of the 1935 - 36 US Eastern Amateur Ski Association championships. 

Bellows Pip . The origin is unclear, but the first use of the name is attributed to Henry David Thoreau, who climbed Mt. Greylock in 1844 by way of Bellows Pipe, “a long and spacious valley” so named because “the winds rush up or down it with violence. Indians believed the noise to be the angry voice of the spirit Manitou.

MA 2, Hoosic River Although the spelling is different for the river, the mountain (Hoosac) and the town (Hoosac) , the name is thought to come from either the Mahican term for “stony place” or the Natick word for “pinnacle” The Hoosic Patent was granted to Maria van Rennssalaer in 1688 A map published in 1739 calls the river the Hoosuck. It originates ear Dalton and empties into the Hudson. 

Williamstown MA, west A fort settlement situated here in the Northwest Corner of the MA colony in 1745 was originally called West Hoosac. The fort was intended to guard against the Dutch in NY. Ephraim Williams was the commander of a line of forts and stockades that ranged east of to the Connecticut River. He was killed in the French and Indian War in the Battle of Lake George. His will included money to found a “free school” the equivalent of a public high school today with two stipulations first, the town of West Township had to be renamed Williamstown (this was don in 1765) Second, the school had to be in MA (this took time because NY and A were fighting over which state held title to the land that included Williamstown; the dispute was resolved in 1784 in Ma’s favor) In 1785 , the school was established. It became Williams College in 1793.

MA-VT border southern end of Long Trail Predating the idea of the AT by more than a decade, the Long Trail traverses the Green Mountains from the MA line to the Canadian border . It was the brainchild of a VT schoolteacher named James Taylor who came upon the idea while waiting out a storm on a camping trip. (Taylor is also credited with the idea of establishing a federal tax on gasoline to pay for road building. ) The trail is maintained and its protection advocated by the Green Mountain Club. The AT follows the route of the Long Trail for more than a hundred miles in Souther VT.
Though not on the AT, the Deerfield river flows 79 miles from Vermont to the Connecticut River, The name is possibly transferred from Deerfield, MA because it was the hometown of Ebenezer Hinsdale, who had been granted land patents in VT. Hinsdale was educated at Harvard and ordained a minister, becoming a missionary in the cause to convert Indians to Christianity. He later became a trader and officer in the British Army using his position to gain patens in several Vermont towns.

Kid Gore Shelter Built in 1971 by the Green Mountain Club and Camp Najerog alumni and named for Harold M. “Kid” gore, owner of Najerog, While this “Gore” is a surname, the word is peculiarly VT term of geography, describing land grants that fell between the boundaries of town grants. Gores tended to be triangular in shape because their boundaries typically need at the top of a mountain Two boundary lines were then extended until they reached either the next gore or the township line below. Connecting these points with a third boundary created a triangle. 
Caughnawaga Shelter was before Kid Gore Shelter Thought to be a made up moniker bestowed in 1931 by the shelter's builders who also built Camp Najerog another manufactured name.

Stratton - Arlington Rd / Kelly Stand Rd ( Daniel Webster Monument ) Aslo known as Arlington- W. Wardsboro Rd. Arlington was probably named for Augustus Fitzroy (1735 - 1811) the 4th earl of Arlington, in Suffolk, England (an earl is a position of British nobility, one level above a viscount), He was prime minister of England in 1768 -70, but lost the job because of unrest in America, Wardsboro is named for William Ward of Newfame, one of the original grantees in 1780. Kelly Stand was once a small settlement, but little remains of it today Local tradition says that the village grew up around a logging operation owned by a man named Kelly There was also a John Kelly who claimed patents on thousands of acres in VT after he was awarded the land by NY colony, which disputed NH colony’s claim to the land. (VT at that time, was part of NH) King George III ruled in NY’s favor Because of this, the newly formed VT legislature recognized Kelly’s patents in several towns It is conceivable that Kelly is the same man for whom the logging settlement is presumed to have been named. 

I lived in Arlington Vt for a few years. My daughter started kindergarten there and I brought home my new baby boy there. It was one of the most pleasant times in my life.

Beacon Hill While Boston’s Beacon Hill conjures images of Paul Revere, this one has more contemporary origins. It is need for the airport beacons here. 

Lottery Rd The trail crosses the road several miles west of Shrewsbury. While the precise origin of the name remains elusive, the origin of lotteries in the country offers a glimpse of life in colonial and federal America. Lotteries were a common way for businesses to raise capital, Individuals to dispose of property and governments to finance public works. In 1783 , for example, Athony Haskell and David Russell requested and received from the VT legislature ( VT was still an independent republic at the time) permission to hold a lottery for the purpose of financing VTs first paper mill. It was built in what is today North Bennington. In 1775 William West , a Revolutionary War patriot, held a letter to sell his land so that he could repay debs incurred during the war- most of the war effort was financed from the pockets of patriots. As for Lottery Road, conjecture is that the road was built from the proceeds of a lottery. It may also men that you were as likely to get through this road in winter as you were to win the lottery.

Mt. Guyot photo stop Named for Arnold Guyot , a Swiss scientist and professor of geography at Princeton. He published a map of the White Mountains in 1860. and explored the geology and ecology of the entire length of the Appalachian range. Peaks in five state, plus a crater on the moon, bear his name. which is associated with nearly every early exploration and scientific measurement of the Smokies. Guyot developed a system of measuring elevations using a fragile glass barometer and his advances in the observation of meteorological events led to the formation of the US Weather Bureau. He was also a voracious place namer. In his travels , he named more than three dozen features along what would become the AT. He is credited with influencing the acceptance of word Appalachian for the entire eastern mountain chain chosen over Allegheny, now associated with a single range. Mt Guyot in the Smokies was named by S. B. Buckley a fellow Appalachian explorer.

Then Crawford Path goes the to east of the summit and is rejoined by the Mount Eisenhower Loop and the Edmands Path on the north side.

Mt Eisenhower trail What’s interesting about this name is not that it supplanted another through politics, Former governor and President Dwight Eisenhower aide Sherman Adams successfully lobbied the NH legislature to replace the all to common “Pleasant Mountain: in 1972 . What’s most notable is the toponymical debris the renaming left behind. There is still on the mountain a stream called Mt Peasant Brook. Although some have argued for changing the name of the stream to Eisenhower, such concern for consistency has never been held in high regard by people who enjoy the history of the mountain.

Crawford Path the first trail built to the summit of Mt Washington, in 1819, by Abel and Ethan Allen Crawford. Later they established Crawford House, the first hotel in Crawford Notch, It burned in 1976 The famous Mt Washington weather observatory, called Summit House, opened in 1870 Photo Spot 

Mt Washington photo spot Originally called Agiocochook, an Algonquian word meaning “ Place of the Great Spirit of the Forest” it was named for George Washington. At 6288 feet it is the highest point in the northeast US Weather systems collide here and in April 1934 they produced a wind speed of 231 miles per hour, the highest ever recorded on land and a record that stood until 1999. Wind speeds here reach 100 miles per hour on more than 100 days a year ( 75 mph is considered hurricane force ) A temperature of minus 41 degrees F and a wind speed of 110 mph were recorded here on Feb 12 1967 The first trail to the summit was cut by Abel and Ethan Allen Crawford in 1819. Huntington Ravie named for J H. Huntington who was one of the first scientists to conduct winter research on Mt Washington. He first attempted to winter on the summit in 1858 but couldn't raise the funds to finance the trip. Eleven years later, he finally secured funding for winter research, but still hadn't found adequate shelter. That same year, 1869 , the famous cog railway to the top of Mt. Washington began operation. because the buildings that housed the railway machinery were unused in the winter, Huntington hoped to stay in them, but he couldn't get the approval of the railroad. So Huntington instead spent the winter of 1869 doing research while camped on frozen Mt. Moosilauke. Newspaper accounts of the scientist's situation generated bad publicity for the railway; he was allowed to use the railway's Mt. Washington buildings the following year. 

Trinity Height Connector The AT continues on the Trinity Heights Connector for .1 mile, meeting the Gulfside trail which it will follow for the rest of the Presidential Range.

Cross Cog Railroad  This  engineering wonder  began operating in 1869  running from the town of Carroll to the summit of Mt Washington, a distant of 3 miles. It was built by Sylvester Marsh who adopted the go system invented by Herrick and Walter Aiken of Franklin. Instead of rails, the cog railway uses a series of slots into which h=gears or teeth fit. At one time called ""Jacobs Ladder"" the grade reaches 37.4 percent, the steepest railway grade in the world. 
Dropping steadily the trail crosses the Cog Railroad tracks and skirts the Great Gulf on the way to the Washington-Clay col.

Westside Trail 

Mt Clay Loop This trail loop gets its name from the mountain named by botanist William Oakes in 1848 for American statesman Henry Clay (1777 -1852) Despite his reputation as one of the most popular and influential political figures in American history, Clay was an unsuccessful candidate for president three times 1824, 1832, and 1844. He was secretary of state under John Quincy Adams Oakes is the author of Scenery of the White Mountains. photo spot

The Mount Jefferson Loop leaves here and the AT now passes to the east of the summit and drops steadily towards Edmands Col. Several trails meet at Edmands Col including the Edmands Col Cutoff, the Randolph Path, the Castle Ravine trail and the Mount Jefferson Loop. A moderate climb takes the trail out of the col, past Storm Lake and on to Thunderstorm Junction. From here the Lowe's Path goes up to Mt Adams to the south. The AT descends toMadison Springs Hut in the col between Mt Adam  and Mt. Madison .
Gray Knob Cabin. The knob receives it's name from the gray rocky outcropping on Nowell Ridge, which is above the cabin site. The first chin was built on this site in 1906 by Dr. E J. Hincks on land he leased from a timber company. After the forest service acquired the land., Hincks was given a lease on the condition that the cabin be open to the public. In 1989 the new cabin was built on the site. 
The Great Gulf Wilderness reportedly named by Ethan Alen Crawford, one of the namers of the Presidential Mountains and with his father, proprietor of the first hotel built on Mount Washington. While leading a group on a trek here in the 1820's Crawford became lost and found himself on the edge of a ""Great Gulf"" in NewEngland ""gulf"" is a term for a gap or pass. Early descriptions referred to the area as the ""Gulf of Mexico"". 
The Gulfside trail so named because it circles the Great Gulf between Mt. Washington and the Madison Hut. 

Edmands Col, Gulfside Spring J. Raymer Edmands was a a founder of the Appalachian Mountain Club in 1876 An influential path builder, he believed that footpaths should follow landscape contours rather than simply head straight up a mountainside Edmands boasted that his trails were so blended into the contour that anyone’s mother could walk to the summit of Mt Washington. Although none of his trails actually approached this summit, he did build well traded traps through the northern Presidentials, His ideas were of odds with those of another AMC founder Eugene Cook, whose devotees believed that the straightest line between bottom and top created a rugged wild experience most hikers would favor These opposing philosophies influenced trail building throughout the eastern US. To this day, footpaths in NY tend to be vertical, while those in the Blue Ridge make use of switchbacks and hug the terrain . One thin goth Edmands and Cook agreed on was a kibosh on the word “trail” which to them, evoked images of wagon trains. Path or footpath was the favored term Among Edmands innovations are an early version of the backpack and the use of cairns stacks of stones to mark paths above the treeline. 

Israel Ridge Path to RMC cabins Was named by J, Rayner Edmands a founder of the Appalachian Mountains Club, because it is close to the source of the Israel river. The river was named for Israel Glines, one of the two brothers who hunted here sometime before 1750. 

Peabody Spring Peabody brook trail probably transferred from Peabody River in Gotham. Legend tells of a Mr Peabody from Andover, MA, who saw the river born when a torrent of water from Mt. Washington swept away the cabin in which he had just been sleeping.

Airline Trail, King Ravine Trail Airline given it’s name by its builders, Laban Watson And EB Cook, in the 1870s. The trail was built in the White Mountains to follow a ridge line rather than a valley hence the name. King Ravine and Starr King Moutain are named for Thomas Starr King, a Unitarian clergyman who explored this area and wrote about it extensively over several summers In 1871 he published a collection of his work The White Hills, Their Legends, Landscapes & poetry, credited with bringing many visitors here Kings explorations in the American West also led to the naming of Mt. Starr King in Yosemite NP in CA

Madison Springs Hut , The oldest hut in the White Mountains having opened in 1888 The original hu was expanded in 1906m 1922 and 1929 Fire destroyed it in 1940 it was rebuilt in 1941 under direction of hut master, Joe Dodge, longtime manager of the Appalachian Mountain Club hut system- a post he held for 30 years. Valley Way Trial was established by at the Appalachian Mountain Club originals E B Cook land Laban Watson in the 1880s Later improvements were made by AMC founding president J Rayner Edmands who originated the now common practice of planning trails to follow topographic contours Once Edmands was done with the trail, it closely followed the valley of Snyder Brook.
Daniel Webster (Scout) Trail runs up the side of Madison Named for the American orator and statesman Daniel Webster (1782-185) who was born in Salisbury and attended Dartmouth College  He served in the House of Representatives for NH and MA then later served in the Senate representing MA.

North of Gorham is Berlin NH- Originally called Maynesborough to honor Sir William Mayne of London in 1771 it's name was changed in 1829 The story for years had been that the change was made to recognize Berlin, MA, because many settlers to the area had come from that part of MA. Today the conventional wisdom is that the town was named for Berlin, in Prussia  Germany presumably because town elders thought the cosmopolitan name would lure new settlers. 
Continuing south parallel to NH Rt 16, the Lost Pond trail hits the Wildcat Ridge trail which climbs out of Pinkham Notch, giving nice views of Mt. Washington from the ledges.

The Wildcat Mountain named by professor Arnold Guyot of Princeton, who named dozens of Appalachian places - many of which had perfectly fine names before he arrived. Legend has it that either he or a friend one saw a panther here, an animal that is no longer found in these mountains. The mountain was formerly named Mt Hight and East Mountain because it was located east of Pinkham Notch.

Carter Mountain - There are a few stories about the origin of this name. The two most common say that Carter was a hater who worked the mountains In one, he is a lone woodsman. In the other he plies his trade with a companion named Hight. When they become separated, they climb adjoining mountains to look for each other, giving each mountain their respective names. Another story says that the mountain was named for Dr. Ezra Carter , a physician from Concord NH who searched this area for herbs and roots. 
The final stage of the AT in NH heads steeply up the side of Carter Dome , then along the Carter ridge. The Imp Shelter is west of the trail.

In another, two hunters one named Carter and the other Hight, hunt together in this area. When they get separated, they eat climb to the top of a mountain to see if they can see each other. Te one Carter climbs is named Carter Dome. The one Hight climbs becomes Mt. Hight. A name held until Arnold Guyot impetuously changed the name to Wildcat Mountain. Later to preserve the Hight name and the story, the peak north of carter Dome was renamed Mt. Hight.

Near Monson Maine is Boarstone Mountain. Philip Rutherford's Dictionary of Maine Place-names and the 1936 edition of the Maine AT guide differ on the origin of the name but each reflects a common occurrence in name creation visual association and transformation from an Indian language. Rutherford reports that the mountain's name comes from its resemblance to a boar's testicles. To city slickers and suburbanites hiking the trail, this might not conjure a definitive image, but it must have meant something to early settlers. According to the early AT guide, however, the name was an anglicization of an Indian word , the origin of which is lost. The first published reference to Boarstone occurs in 1839 when geologist C T Jackson noted it in his ""Report on Maine Geology"" Borr Mountain appears on several early maps as does Elliotville Mountain, associating the peak with the nearby town.

I read online that the down will not retain it’s warmth if it’s crushed beneath you. I don’t know about the polyfill. Research.. Research. I do like the warmth of down but I also like that the polyfill will dry faster if it gets wet. Oh my, What’s a hiker to do? Ha.",,Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to ME,"Sep 08, Fri",0

Bog Bridge 

Golden Rd Millinocket Me Built by the Great Northern Paper Company it was likely named for the vast fortune in timber that rolled over it It is now private toll road owned by the Georgia Pacific forest products company. 

Abol Bridge This is one of the most lyrical place names of the entire AT corridor, but unfortunately one we rarely hear in it’s original form . From the Abenaki word Aboljackarnegassic, meaning “bare” or devoid of trees” it shortened by white settlers.

Foss and Knowlton Brook Located in Baxter State Park, the stream is named for Foss, and Knowlton, a large lumber operation in this area that ceased pertain in the 1920s.

Lower fork of Nesowadnehunk Stream ford stream 

The Nesowadnehunk Stream name is an Abenaki word meaning ""swift stream between the mountains” It was revised from “Sowdnahunk” by order of the U S Geographic Board in 1929 to clarify an error of earlier scholarship The board added the prefix and exchanged some vowels. It is known locally as SowdyHunk. Stretching across Nesowadnehunk Stream are the ruins of a lumberman’s dam once used to store water which would be released to form freshets that carried logs downstream. Before 1956 , the AT crossed here. That year, a cable bridge collapsed where the Abol Bridge is today, leading to the development of the current route. Come about 1840 timber had been the dominant industry in ME. It evolved through three phases. first, the states massive pine trees were harvested for shipments and other products up until about the Civil War. From about 1860 until 1890 spruce logs were harvested. Since 1890 the wood was cut into 4 ft lengths much easier for hauling. Smaller pulp trees, or topple, are now harvested and made into paper products. Early tote roads or haul roads used to transport timber were primitive affairs on which logs were skidded. usually to a stream or river for further transport. After a prohibition on river transport went in to effect in 1976 Larger and longer haul roads were built.

Daicey Pond Nature Trail There are a number of lumber dams bearing the name Daicey given rise to the conjecture that Daicey owned a timber operation Or perhaps he owned land nearby, coming to hunt at Daicey’s Clearing. The cabins around Dsicey Pond are the remnants of the Yorks Twin Pine Camp. The name derives from the massive white pines that frame the camp entrance from the 1930s until the late 1950s, it was possible to walk the entire AT in ME staying at “sporting camps” each night. Today, only two camps remain near the trail. Yorks twin Pine Camp was the site of the 1939 AT conference. 

Tracy and Elbow Pond Trails Tracy Pond named for Foster Tracy a partner in the logging company Tracy and Love, circa 1883 Elbow named for it’s distinctive shape 

Grassy Pond Trail This was the route of the AT to Daicey Pond until about 1969. The name refers to the shallow, grassy character of the pond.

The first 78 miles of the trail lies within Georgia and the Chattahoochee National Forest. Chattahoochee is Cherokee for ""flower painted rock"".  

Chattahoochee National Forest. One Translation claims the word is Cherokee for ""Corn Rock"" or Flower Rock"" Another has Chatt meaning ""sparkling or flowered"" and ochre meaning ""rocks"". The river is named for the Cherokee town once located there., The spring here is considered the source of the River in 1932, a group of GA AT Club hikers determined that the spring was the highest and most northerly stream source of the Chattahoochee"".

Big Stamp Gap, USFS 42, Big Stamp Gap was where I was dropped off in 2014. There were a few people there to welcome us to the trail. Being April 1st, there were many of us starting that day. I hiked up to the beginning of the trail 1 mile and signed in where the plaque for the AT is. It was a very exciting moment then and will be again. I was finally there! 

The Benton MacKaye Trail. This branch trail is named for the man know as the founder of the AT, who lived from 1879-1976. Construction of the trail, which intersects the AT in GA, was begun by the Benton MacKay Trail Association in 1980. MacKaye's article, ""The Appalachian Trail, an Experiment in Regional Planning,"" published in 1922, proposed a series of conservation lands along the spine of the Appalachian Mountains with spurs leading to the Atlantic Ocean. The Article served as the inspiration for the AT. MacKays conception was based on VT's popular Long Trail. You can read the article online at : An Appalachian Trail: A Project in Regional Planning

Stover Creek Shelter, Fannin County. 

Stover Creek 

Three Forks foot bridge, over Chester Creek.Three large creeks- Stover, Chester and Long- converge here to form Noontootla Creek. Probably Cherokee for ""land of the shinning water."" but the name might be a corruption of Nantahala, meaning ""midday sun"". 
 The Long Creek Falls is a two mile out and back hike from the trail and is considered worth taking the time to visit it. I know in the beginning of the hike, I was just too anxious to be on my way to take any detours. I plan on seeing more of the places offered along the way.

USFS 58, and the Hickory Flats Cemetery , on the way to the shelter. Hickory Flats cemetery in Chatahoochie National Forest was a place that I did stop at on my last hike.

The first few days are not 12 miles but more like 8 mile days. It's meant to break you into the hike and will increase miles in the days ahead. This has not happened for me as of yet.  The weather has been cold wet and then very warm.  Moving along at a slower pace than planned but my legs are getting stronger everyday!  
Don't be surprised if you hear a helicopter flying low overhead. The area at Hightower Gap is a training area for Army Rangers. I did get to see a few of them and was offered to fill my water bottles from their water tank that had been brought there with them. 

Hightower Gap Thought to be either a corruption of the creek word italwa, meaning ""town"" or the Cherokee word itawa , or etowah, meaning ""dead wood"".

Gooch Mountain Shelter, Union County.
Gooch Mountain Shelter, built in 2001, was donated in memory of hiker Kurt von Seggern by his family. It was designed by family members and architect, Dolly Hawkins. She incorporated in the plan two sleeping levels for extra space and an overhanging roof to provide a covered cooking and eating area. The shelter site also includes tent pads for campers, a state of the art moldering privy, and food hoist cables.The shelter was completed in September 2001 after 2000 volunteer hours from GATC members and guests went into the construction of the shelter and the site amenities. An additional 3000 volunteer hours were contributed to building a 6000 foot relocation of the AT that was needed to reach the new shelter. 
We will see how well this shelter has held up over the past seventeen years.  It was a muddy spot to camp in and a muddy morning to clean up gear.","

Ramrock Mountain has a beautiful view.. take a picture! 
Woody Gap offered wonderful trail magic from Donna and Indiana Jones who drive to the trail every year to give out food to hungry hikers!  I have never known so many giving strangers until now!  I am blessed!
Woody Gap Ga 60 crosses at a parking lot with restrooms, trash bins and water available. 2 Miles from Suches where you can stay at a hostel if needed Woody Gap is named after Arthur Woody who served as a ranger for 30 years. There are stories that he ran through the woods barefooted! He grew up in the area and saw the last of the white tailed deer. He devoted his life to replenish the deer by bringing in five a year from other states. Now there are thousands roaming Chattahoochee. 
Big Cedar Mountain rock ledges and views. Picture time! 
Dockers Lake Trail offers tenting. Lance Creek, less than a mile further up the trail also offers tenting and water! This is where I stayed in 2014.

History note: For 12 years, Tillie Wood of Roswell, Georgia has been the purveyor of ""trail magic"" for many hikers in the Sugar Run Valley near Pearisburg, Virginia. Tillie spent three months every year welcoming hikers into her home and cooking them a bountiful breakfast. In 1997, she had 355 hikers stay in her Wood's Hole bunkhouse. The new shelter was dedicated to Tillie, and in memory of her late husband, Roy.
I stayed at Woods Hole Hostel in Virginia before I left the trail. Tillie's grand daughter and husband now own Woods Hole Hostel. A wonderful place to stay.

 the Duncan Ridge Trail, is thought to be the longest continuous ridge projecting from the main Blue Ridge: the trail along it was built in the 1970's by the GA AT Club and Forest Service. The origin of the name remains elusive .  

Blood Mountain Shelter, Lumpkin County.
 
Flatrock Gap.
 
Blood Mountain is the highest elevation that the trail crosses in Georgia.( The highest mountain in Georgia is Brasstown Bald . The Cherokee phrase Itse 'yi means town of the green valley or place made green with vegetation The word was confused with the Cherokee word Untsai""yi, which means ""brass"" In a Cherokee legend reminiscent of the story of Noah, a great flood killed everyone on earth except the few who landed atop this peak in a big canoe The Great Spirit cleared the summit of trees so the survivors could plant crops until the flood waters subsided ) 
 It's a hard climb up Blood Mountain, but a beautiful one. 
There are various theories on the origin of the mountain's name. Some believe that the name of the mountain comes from a bloody battle between the Cherokee and Creek Indians. Some people believe that it got its name from the reddish color of the lichen and Catawba growing near the summit. 
I'd like to think that it was named for nature and not for war! 
 
After researching more of the Indian history in the area, I have to think it is more likely named for the battle between the tribes. It's also the area that in years ahead would become part of the ""Trail of Tears"" where the Indians were marched out from the Southeast to the Midwest. The relocated people suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route, and more than four thousand died before reaching their various destinations. 
The Cherokee believed that a great frog, Walasi (or Walesi) guarded Blood Mountain, which the Cherokee considered to be holy. David Edwin Lillard in his book of Appalachian Trail names tells us much of the same thing. The reddish tint of the local lichen may give the mountain it's name, but the Indian folklore is more colorful. Legends describe a terrible battle between Cherokee and Creek Indians during which the mountain ran red with blood. A cherokee legend tells of the ""Yunwee Chuns Dee"" ( little folk) who dwelled in caves and made magic music heard on the mountain. Also living in the vicinity were the Nunnehee, an invisible peace of normal size people who always aided those lost or injured in the mountains, watching over the Cherokee like guardian angels. <3>

There is the Blood Mountain Shelter on the top of the mountain, Lumpkin County . 
History note: ""The Blood Mountain Shelter on the Appalachian Trail in Georgia was originally constructed from local stone in 1937 for the Georgia State Parks system by Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) workers stationed at Camp Enotah at Vogel State Park. The shelter was transferred to the US Forest Service in a land exchange agreement in 1956. The basic elements of the rooms, window, and doorways of this stone structure remain unchanged, but modifications to the roof and floor have occurred over the years. Unfortunately those seeking comfort during cold nights helped themselves to any easily-removable wooden components such as shutters, window and door frames, sills and lintels to build fires in the stone fireplace. Any replacements met a similar fate! Graffiti, randomly-placed nails, and enthusiastic leaps from the adjacent rock to the easily-damaged wooden roof shakes added to the hiker-related insults to this historic old structure.""
In 2011 the shelter was repaired.
""This was a long and complex process, involving coordination and planning among public and private entities. The result is a stone shelter with a new roof and beams that resemble the original construction in 1937 and that will hopefully last at least another 75 years."" 
 
Neel Gap    A joyful stop on the trail. The trail goes right through Mountain Crossings: A full-service outfitter with full resupply, the trail will run you right into the front door of this first stop along the trail. You you don’t need more than four days of food to get you here. The Byron Reece Trail from Neels Gap takes you to the Byron Memorial . Reese was a poet from Union County who farmed near Cloestoe. The footpath, constructed by the GA AT Club provides access to the AT at Neels Gap. Something I will consider doing when I reach there next year. This is the only place where the AT goes through a buildings structure. Discarded hiking shoes decorate the trees around the Mountain Crossings outfitter store. 
 I stayed there in 2014. They offer the ""shakedown"" where they advised me to send home 15 lbs of gear that I didn't need. That ""comfort"" stuff I thought I couldn't live without. ha. I also bought a new backpack that I still love. It replaced the ""Go lite"" bag that didn't fit right and was falling apart. 
 I love the Deuter pack I have and will use it again next year. The removable lid will not be going with me. Though it was handy in holding my electronics, it made it more difficult to get at my food bag. I have a smaller nylon shoulder bag (thank you CeeBee) that I am going to put inside the pack for my electronics, guide book and other things I will look at during the day. This can be taken out to use as my carry bag when I am in town.   
They have a bunk house, laundry, showers and store to replenish food. I left there feeling refreshed, much lighter and raring to go on my way!  Again Rick picked us up and brought us to the park.  We were exhausted!","Jarrard Gap

 Hummingbird Ellie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590292,"Happy Mother's Day.    I'm back in California for this year.  Leaving the trail at Dick's Gap, it was time to go home.   I got off before the frost bite set in for good.  It isn't my year.  How disappointing it is!   I got off because I couldn't bend my fingers and my feet and legs were swollen to where my boots were hurting me.  I thought I may be able to go back when the below freezing temperatures and rain, sleet and snow stopped. After being home three weeks, my ankles and feet swell within an hour of walking.  It will take much longer to heal than I expected.  
Trying to figure out what I could have done differently on the trail haunts me.  I bought a new tent when my old tent flooded out. I should have had a warmer sleeping bag.. I froze most everynight. Maybe next year will be ""Spring"" in April. This year has been winter in April. 
I thought I might try to go back and do a flip flop hike from Virginia, but everyday that seems less likely.  So here I will wait and hope for better weather next year.  I still want to be there and envy those who are out in the mountains now. I'll keep following and dreaming that it will be my time then!",,View Entry,"May 13, Sun",0
