Jamie Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562550,"Well my family is for sure on board. I have decided I will likely start after my wife's February school break next year, hopefully hump it and be done before summer is over. I plan to stay light and quick. I've been hiking everyday with a 32lb ruck and it has been smoking my traps. But I assume like all else if I hunker down it will soon become the norm.",,View Entry,"May 01, Mon",0
Jamie Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562910,"I've ran/hiked 22 miles this week so far. Truth be told I live in South Georgia and it is incredibly flat, I mean completely flat. I will have to find some hills or something later on down the road to get my bootie used to mountains I suppose. Nonetheless I am putting in miles. I have the benefit of being a freshly retired fairly young stay at home Daddy. So I have a baby in a running stroller to contend with but I always have a running buddy and we can train any time we want. I've been looking at gear alot lately and just purchased a Garmin 230 forerunner so I can track distance. I need to tent shop and get a pack picked out but there is plenty of time left for that. Maybe black Friday will have some deals for me. I will try to update a few times a week with mileage and progress. I have dropped several lbs in the past few weeks which I needed to do anyway. So I'll update soon. And here is some more punctuation!?:;'""?!;:..,,,",,View Entry,"May 03, Wed",0
Jamie Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565658,"Truth be told, the more I put in effort the more I get knocked flat on my butt. I guess it's life in general. I am interested in this hike for a few reasons but I think it's mostly about finding myself...how original. I wish I could tell you I am excited but I'm not. I wish I could tell you I'm ready but I'm not. The last few weeks have been fair but then you have a day that let's you know how far away from things you really are. I want to be mentally committed but my mind is continuously elsewhere. My life has been topsy turvy lately. As simple as things should be they simply are not. I'm pretty satisfied with life, others will never be just satisfied. Everything must be well not easy. I don't really look forward to things anymore, I suppose it's my former life where things were always changing suddenly. Anyway... I have some things I need to work out. Or play out. But if I am patient my GOD is there waiting to fix them in his time. If anyone reads this pray for me please not for patience but wisdom and a little bit of backbone. Goodnight.",,View Entry,"May 23, Tue",0

Jamie Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575590,"I am getting excited. I plan to leave towards the end of February. I would like to have a decent pace but I am fat so we will see how that goes. I have a few people that are interested in section hiking with me along the way but I am a retired State Trooper and would like a thick and thin battle buddy. I think it could benefit it lots of ways. I would like to be in contact with you or y'all well prior to departure. Maybe even meet up for some hiking. I live in South Ga, So I am not so well adapted to snow! If anyone is interested Message me at jdwilson385@gmail.Â ",,View Entry,"Aug 19, Sat",0
Jamie Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575913,"I'm not excitable. I suppose it's because of the multitudes of car chases and crashes and stupid situations I've been in. No clue. But the closer I get to starting my Nobo (north bound) thru hike (start to finish no stopping must be done in 1 calendar year) of the Appalachian Trail (2,190 miles this year) the more I'm getting I think excited about little things. Like to really need the Osprey Aether 70 pack or will the Atmos 65 be big enough or I really do love top ramen and tuna so this won't really be that bad. Just the thought of being in the middle of a national Forest with very few people within hundreds of miles is exciting. Maybe it's nerves and not excitement but either way I'll take it. Now all I have to do is figure out how to poop (never done it) in the woods and I'll be set. JamieP.S. I'll start posting some of the acronyms on here now so when I'm 100 days into the trail you won't read something and say what in the world is he talking about. Also someone told me to start a Amazon registry for some of the items I need and will need along the way. If anyone is interested in that info let me know. I do not expect anyone to buy anything but if someone wants to be part of this trip I was told not to take away somebodys blessing://diaryofastayathomedadd...",,View Entry,"Aug 23, Wed",0
