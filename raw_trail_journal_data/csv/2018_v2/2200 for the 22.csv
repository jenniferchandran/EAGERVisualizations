2200 for the 22,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582553,"About three weeks ago a thought crept into my head and just wouldn't go away. ""I should hike the Appalachian Trail"". Hmmm... Solitude. Nature. Freedom. Sounds like a dream, right?..I don't know who might end up reading this, but i'll give you a little insight into who I am...I am not a hiker. I am retired from the military, which gives me a leg up, maybe, from those desk jockeys who decide to do this. Oh wait, I AM a desk jockey. Well, was. I retired in 2010. And when I say I retired, I mean I RETIRED.I started working again last fall because my couch threatened to break up with me. It said I was smothering it. Baby.When I said i'm not a hiker, that's only partially true. I take part in the occasional Irreverent Warrior Silkies Hike, and I do enjoy a ""Hash"" on occasion as well. (IW Silkies Hikes are 22km pub crawls, carrying 22kg of gear, in ranger panties and combat boots, and a ""hash"" is a varying-length running while drinking beer event- google Hash House Harriers). Btw, is there beer on the trail? j/k. Really. ",,View Entry,"May 24, Wed",0
2200 for the 22,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582555,"Finished ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" today. Amazing first book to read when contemplating a thru-hike. I hope to use that as a tentative guide to the different stops, and would love to meet some of the folks David refers to. I realize 14 years have passed since his hike, and I expect much has changed. *Note - In the epilogue and follow-on to David's book, he answers questions and comments on the possibility that he wasn't as pessimistic in his writing as maybe he should have been. Personally, I felt both the negatives and the positives of his writing. I often wonder if i'm romanticizing my own ability to complete this journey. I second guess myself daily, knowing that I am the type to ignore the possibility that something may not be doable. But it is. Doable, that is. Thousands of people have done it, many older than me, and some not even in as minimally good shape as I am. I have a plan, a checklist, and time. My employer is selling T-Shirts to help me get a camera for the hike. The shirts advertise the business, with the saying, ""I told the cook to take a hike"", with the AT symbol... Catchy, huh? Another employee remarked that she should sell T-Shirts so she could go on vacation too. Vacation. Right. ",,View Entry,"May 28, Sun",0
2200 for the 22,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582552,"Well, it's been several months since I made the decision to hike the AT, and, I have to admit, I waffled for a bit the last month or so. Can I REALLY do this?  My preparation has SUCKED! I'm going to be 53 in 13 short days! I've been semi-retired for 8 years (and by that I mean I've gotten laaaaazy)... The list goes on...BUT! I love to hike. I love the outdoors. I'm retired. And hey, I'm ONLY 53 years old (in 13 short days)! This list goes on, too. Thankfully, the ""pro"" list is longer than the ""con"" list. All that, and the fact that I've spent a TON of money on gear. ",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Mon",0
