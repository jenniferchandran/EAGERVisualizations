Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584946,"Well here we are less than two months out and already got the hikers jitters. I have keeping myself especially busy at work tying up loose ends before my departing retirement date-helps make the time go by faster!This past January I was diagnosed with Sjogrens syndrome and I became quite focused on its primary side effects, rheumatoid arthritis and Chronic fatigue. As It turns out, thankfully, I was mis-diagnosed after getting a second opinion.I have been staying busy during non-work hours as well. Currently walking 4 x's week about 7 miles and doing a variety of resistance and hill climbing exercises. just about ready to start training with my 30 pound pack and will start slower and initially shorter mileage.I'm really looking forward to getting on the AT. I've been told by other hikers with good intentions to post in their journal, only to end up by the time you reach your destination camp, you have just about enough energy to pitch your shelter, cook supper, and crash. Hopefully, I will be more alert in the Am! I look forward to posting my journal as often as possible  and add a photo or two as well.May 15th can't come soon enough!Kibs","Harpers Ferry, WVA

It was not what I expected!  Need to get used to the 30lb weight!Also worked on my gear, sprayed all clothing with Pyrethrin- ticks can be a real health hazard if you don't take precautions. A little more tweaking  and getting myself dialed in on logistics, supply drops, etc",,Harpers Ferry start date 5/15,"Mar 31, Sat",0
Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589173,"after months of conditioning, I believe I am ready to go! Being ready to me means I can now hike 7+ miles without any pain. In Hikers terms this means that I have my “trail legs”  My confidence level grows the stronger I get. 1 our of 5 hikers end up not finishing their hike for a number of reasons. I will remain cautious and to not get overly confident due to this fact. After competing in many long distance races throughout my adult life, I truly understand those many reasons why hikers “bomb” out.Time will tell and pray my old bod stays together!!",,View Entry,"May 05, Sat",0

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591616,"Hello Everyone!Sorry for the delay in my journal entries. Had one sunny day since May 16 and finally got to a town in Waynesboro, Pa today.Had to stop- not because of the rain but my Prosthesis is inoperable and tomorrow will find a mechanic in town to do a little bionic surgery. Should not be a big deal to fix but right now it’s totally not working. Some of the views are incredible- even in the rain!The continuous rain has flooded sections of the trail including a huge walkway bridge in Harpers Ferry that closed shortly after I crossed.I am continuously trying to keep ahead of the rain and keeping my stuff dry. I will learn how to better post photos as I go. (Sorry) The rocks on the trail in Maryland were treacherous with razor sharp edges. Even a little fall on those bad boys will definitely leave a mark! Looking forward to a shower and to the laundromat to knock down the stench a little.People here are quite friendly and was able to get several rides for supplies, etc Now I can see why so many people quit. Not only having the wrong gear but to prepare mentally for crappy weather or a major inconvenience- people will just give up. I met a couple yesterday that had started the AT back in Feb down in Ga. and we’re quitting. They said the weather, boredom and just tired of looking at trees. I look forward to sunnier sky’s hopefully coming soon.Even a rainy, muddy day still beats a day at work-Ha!Take care for now. Thanks for your guest messages as wellKibs","

So now i have a 11:00 appointment back in Haggerstown, MD tomorrowAll I got to do is hitch a ride 20 miles south by tomorrow. No problem -right?I must say, now that im Fed, clothes cleaned, and sunny skies,I am a happy camper!!! 7 days of rain was a bummer!I wish you all a fantastic day today. Please dont think Im ignoring you- 90% of the time I am out of cell phone range ( love it) but will make additional entries as I come off the trail for supplies, etc.Cheers,Kibs","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595598,"hello friends,
Big storm last night and back again today @ 1:00 probably will take a zero and stay at a hostel tonight until things dry out! I have met some of the nicest people while hiking the AT. Many hikers from foreign countries and retirees from just about any profession. Had a MD stay in my camp last night. As it turns out, he worked in Bariatrics in one of my Houston hospitals.
Pennsylvania is by far, one of the toughest places to hike. With razor-like sharpness on the rocks.
It shredded two pair of my Salomon shoes. The second pair had the soles coming off in just 9 days. Moving kinda slow through the first four states but intend to pick up more mileage as the nasty rocks subside.
Life on the trail is wonderful. It’s been absolutely beautiful with wide- open vistas at mountain tops. You can see for miles!
I have seen tons of baby fawns -just minutes or hours old. No bears, lots of big black rat snakes- but no bears,some have seen  porcupines. I should see plenty of them in Shenandoah,Va on my southern journey.This really isn’t a bad gig at all. You look and smell like a HoBo!  But no one cares and everyone is like you!Local towns and churches open their doors for shelter, food and a place to get re-booted after torrential rain. It’s really amazing how people will go out of their way to help.
I have stayed in hostels as well. They are usually 1/3-1/2 Cheaper. Not very accomodating -basically,  a place to crash and get out of the rain- no showers, no a/c,etc
I appreciate your patience with my lag on blogs and pics. Just hard to get everything done when in town. Also reliable WiFi.
Until my next post- take care

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597172,"hello family and friends!I’m in Kent Connecticut and staying at a wonderful hostel overlooking the Housatonic river-another ecological disaster thanks to the GE Corp for years of dumping PCB waste into the river. PPM levels are so high that it is unsafe to eat fish from this beautiful river of white rapids, water falls and deep pools.I’m spending another night here to re-do the waterproofing on my tent rainfly. Should be up and out of here tomorrow AM.Last week I had problems with three bears that showed up after dark to rip off all of my food I hung about 14 ‘ off the ground.Momma bear taught her cubs well. She sent them up the tree as I watched them up the tree to pull up my food bag and then disappear into the woods. Had to get up next morning and hike down the mountain and hitch a ride to the nearest resupply- bought $35 worth of junk food at a shell station just to get by.All off the weeks supply of food taken by the bears was donated to me by Doc and Andy-fellow ATHikers that exited the trail early due to unanticipated events. Sorry guys, only got one meal out of that donation.My hiking is going well but am pretty slow hiking over rocks.I hope this does not deter my hiking friend-Jeff Hendricks, of Marquette,Mi from joining me a little later than planned to hike N Carolina in the fall.I look forward to sending you more updates when WiFi and cell reception is available.Cheers,Kibs","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598031,"Hello Friends and Family,Kibs is taking a couple of zeros(no mileage) due to heavy rain and needed stop to the Laundromat. Everything I have was filthy and discusting and soaked in Deet! I will never use Deet again on this trail! Canada outlaws Deet for good reasons. It was very hard on my skin and started building up in my clothes and sleeping bag. Now using essential oils which is not caustic to your system and repels skeeters pretty good.I have learned a lot since out here in the trail. Basically you must “embrace the suck!” That includes putting on your wet clothes in the morning from the day before. Getting so dirty you feel like there’s a cloud of dirt encircled around you-kinda like Pig Pen on Charlie Brown-dealing with blisters, bruises , scratches that appear at any given time, buzzing mosquitoes in your ears while trying to sleep,Packing up wet gear and so on.I have met some incredible people. Everyone is so kind and helpful. Local townspeople and even fellow hikers are wanting to see you succeed. This is, by no exaggeration, the hardest thing I’ve ever attempted. I don’t think a one-armed guy has ever completed thru-hiking the entire trail. To give you an idea- it’s like hiking in very rough, sometimes steep and very unforgiving, rocky backcountry with your left arm tied behind your back. Would that make you unsettled or nervous? It sure as hell does me! I’m probably one of the slowest hikers on the trail but I have to be very attentive to those damn rocks!! I have without a doubt, have no regrets. Probably have wanted to just quit more times than I have fingers, but the awesome beauty and adventure you experience far surpasses the “suck”and continues to magically draw you along.To all of my past and present fellow hikers, I am deeply greatful for your friendships and great comradery we have had together on and off the trail! Please keep the postings coming from your end as well.Until my next WiFi connection, stay safe as I will do the same.See yah!!!Kibs","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599218,"Hello all!Today, I am reporting from my Brothers house in Michigan due to broken ankle I suffered 3 days ago just after crossing into Vermont. The prior week this area was under heavy rain the trail was very wet and muddy.As I was descending from the second peak, my left foot slipped and I went down with my entire weight landing on my ankle. Not knowing what the level of damage was, a fellow hiker and I fashioned a splint out of a couple of sticks, some medical tape and a foam pad. This accident occurred in a remote area and with the help of 6 other hikers, I was able to hobble 3 hours to get to a very rocky, muddy road. Search and rescue was notified and it took them until past dark to find us. Those hikers stuck with me until help arrived. I was taken to a hospital in Bennington, Vt. Radiology determined I broke two bones so the next day with a temporary cast on, I boarded a bus to the Albany, NY airport. I am now at my brothers house in Michigan with surgery scheduled next Thrs to repair the ankle with screws and plates. After I recover, I will then try to travel back to my home in Houston. I am  disappointed I could not Finnish, however, I must re-evaluate my abilities and based on those and trail conditions, may set out next year to Finnish my hike. Never the less, hiking the AT was the hardest venture I have ever attempted. I experience great people, making friends from every walks in life.Thanks to all for your kind words of encouragement and support. I’m sure by next year, the trail will once again be calling me to hike. So for now, I say good bye to all of you. I plan to add more pictures for everyone to see.Feel free to contact me or leave your comments in my guest book.Take care for now.Kibs","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600609,"My 2018 AT solo-hiking the Appalachian trail proved to be one of those adventures of a lifetime and clearly ranks as one of the most inspiring ventures I’ve ever experienced. although my hike was cut short after suffering a broken ankle in Vermont, I was able to cover 600 miles or 26% of the 2186 miles total miles. I am proud to have made the attempt and was clearly one of the most difficult hikes I ever attempted. I will be carefully looking at options for the 2019 season and to begin where I left off in Bennington Vermont. My solo attempt allowed me to experience some of the most beautiful country mother nature could provide with mountaintop vistas,where you could see for miles, crystal clear lime stone Creek‘s with waterfalls and inviting deep clear pools to soak a weary hikers body (in ice cold water) I  took many pictures of the Flora and Fawna including many plants such as pink lady slippers, Mt. Laurel in pink and white colors, edible plants such as Chicken of the woods bracket fungi, wild carrot, Cattail root and many many wild blueberry strawberry and raspberry’s,huge ancient oak trees whose lifespan existed during the Civil War, many varieties of mushrooms,trees and shrubs. I was fortunate enough to see newly born baby Fawns just minutes old, eastern newt salamanders, skinks, and snakes were everywhere. I did not experience any Eastern Rattlesnakes or poisonous Copperheads only fleeting garter snakes and large Rat snakes. Beginning in Pennsylvania,as most hikers would routinely assemble at the three sided open shelter huts to use the open camp Spaces,but not to sleep in the mouse infected shelters and to use the heavy gauge steel bear boxes to store food overnight. Also, beginning in Pennsylvania, you would see the aftermath of Porcupine damage. Due to their taste For salt, these Quilled pigs would chew away at the shelters ladders, siding and bunkbeds. Shelter caretakers would line every inch of exposed wood with heavy gauge steel mesh within reach of these destructive pests. For whatever reason,all shelter campsites in New York did not provide bear boxes.  At the Fingerboard shelter near West Point,New York, I hung my food 14 feet in the air as a precaution against bears, however by nightfall a mother bear and two cubs appeared and the mother sent the two cubs up the tree where I hung my food and easily made off with my entire bag of food supply.  The next morning I had to hike back down the mountain and hitch a ride into the nearest town for resupply.
Inconveniences such as no food, no water,torrential rain,wet clothes,wet sleeping bags, biting mosquitoes, will test even the most seasoned outdoorsman. You learn very quickly to embrace the suck if you are not able to embrace these unpleasantries, you may end up quitting and
going home. I believe hiking the Appalachian trail is very similar to an extended marathon once you acquire trail legs, the rest of the hike becomes 2/3 mental and only 1/3 physical exertion. The people hiking the Appalachian trail are nothing short of incredible I met people from several European countries-Japan, Australia. Olympic athletes & practically every walk of life -engineers, scientists, college professors, Medical doctors,lawyers emergency medical personnel, nurses and college students. This never ceased to amaze me. The unique collection of people would often show random acts of kindness to one another that in combination with Trail Angels-usually locally found, non-hiking, residents. Trail Angels would appear at trailheads with set up grills and provide coolers full of Gatorade,Coke‘s sandwiches several of them would grill hamburgers and hotdogs hotcakes and eggs-unbelievable!! You would come down a mountain in an area of dried up streams and parched land and you would find jugs of freshwater tucked behind a tree. One day ,while I was in the check out line for $35 of groceries. a lady behind me asked me-oh,are you a thru-hiker ? I said yes and with that she says let me get that and refuse to let me pay $35. local people would stop and give you rides into town offer their homes and garages to shelter you from inclement weather or ask how they could help you. Living in Houston for the past 39 years I have never witnessed such outpouring of friendly and selfless acts of kindness as I did on the AT This was proven time and time again by these wonderful people that wanted to see you make it to summit Mt Katahdin. My last experience with this was when I broke my ankle in a remote mountaintop!A fellow hiker ahead of me heard my cry of agony and pain after falling and breaking two bones in my ankle. She quickly turned around to find me writhing in pain. she knew exactly what to do and help me construct a walking splint fashioned out of two sticks, foam padding, medical tape, and three bandannas by the time the splint was done five more hikers stopped by to help. After getting me back up on my feet, one hiker carried my pack another supported me while I hobbled down the mountain others took vital signs and offered water and food as we traveled it took three hours just to get to a makeshift 2 track Road strewn with large boulders logs and waist-deep pools of water thanks to some beavers damn built nearby the road. Once we got to the two track we were able to get phone reception, search and rescue was notified. The six hikers waited 2 More hours, way past darkness until Search
and rescue found us.
 I cannot find enough words to say how deeply grateful I am for their selfless acts of kindness and total concern for my safety. Their impressive skills in mountain medicine helped comfort me and get me down to a safe rendezvous point to be picked up by the rescuers. I will never forget them and this has restored my faith in humanity without those dedicated hikers I would not have made it to the hospital! keep in mind those hikers were trying to reach a shelter that was already crowded due to the heavy rain that created poor hiking conditions to find a camping spot before nightfall.I know this hike would be a game changer but never realize the magnitude of what I would experience.",,View Entry,"Aug 16, Thu",0
