I continue to prepare for the AT and hiked with my 32 lb pack. The weather was great today and it was fun especially walking on the ridges where the views were absolutely great. Enjoy this beautiful planet!,,Blue Trail and then White Trail back to North Trailhead,"Jan 23, Tue",13.20
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583906,"Chip Johnson, my hiking buddy, and I went hiking at Oak Mountain yesterday after the rain stopped. The day turned out really nice with a slight breeze that kept us cool during most of the hike. Chip is very familiar with Oak Mountain and all of the trails and it is enjoyable to hike with him to learn some of these trails that don't appear on any of the maps that the state provides. The flowers are beginning to bloom on the trail which makes it a better hike than normal. The insects are also beginning to liven up (see the picture of the centipede). We ended up with about 14 miles of hiking and I did carry my 32 pound pack trying to keep in shape to get back on the Appalachian Trail this spring. Enjoy this beautiful planet.",,Hike unmarked trails and ended up on the Yellow Trail,"Mar 04, Sun",14
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583905,"Yesterday I hiked Section 4 of the Pinhoti Trail and the weather was beautiful. This section is 18 miles long and begins at Bull Gap near Sylacauga and goes to Porter Gap. The hikers with me were Chip, Gary, and Luke. We only had one stream where we had to remove our shoes to cross. There was no water on the south end of the trail but there was plenty on the North end. At the end of the hike we met a thru hiker, ""Hobbitt"", that started hiking in Weogufka, AL (the southern terminus of the Pinhoti) and plans to hike to the Appalachian Trail at Springer, then hike to Maine, and then go on to Canada. We wished him luck since this is about a 3000 mile hike. We also met Mr. Camp at the end of the trail who takes hikers into Talladega if they want to resupply or get a hotel for the night. He was a very nice gentleman that offered Hobbitt a ride but he already had someone coming to pick him up. Altogether it was a great day to be on this beautiful planet and the hikers I was with made it even better.",,"Bulls Gap to Porters Gap, Pinhoti Trail","Mar 11, Sun",18
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584095,Chip Johnson and I hiked the Blue Trail from the North Trailhead to the South Trailhead. The day was great for hiking with temperatures in the mid-fifties and a slight wind blowing. The streams were all flowing from the recent rains and Peavine Falls had plenty of water from Peavine Creek. There were not as many hikers on the trail as we expected on just a beautiful day.,,Blue and White Trail ,"Mar 13, Tue",13.10
Negotiator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584434,"Hiked 13.2 miles on Section 6 and Section 7 on the Pinhoti trail with Chip Johnson and Gary Barr. We started Section 6 at Adams Gap and hiked to the Cheaha Trailhead. We then hiked on Section 7 to the Blue Mountain Shelter to spend the night. The day started out with fog in the air so thick we could hardly see. It then started to rain and we could hear thunder but we were in the wilderness so we just kept hiking. Section 6 was pretty rocky and the rocks were slick from the rains. Gary and I slid on some slick, moss covered rocks a few times but had no injuries. We did come across a hiker that had injured his shin in a fall but seemed to be OK. I did ask him if he needed some first aid material and he said everything was fine. The sun came out after the rain and it was a sweaty hike for the remainder of the day. The streams were all full of water which is great when you are hiking. We stopped at a stream before the shelter on Section 7 and filled our water bottles. We also drank a liter and the water was cold and certainly refreshing. We got to the Shelter and set up our tents and made dinner. Gary brought a couple of avocados and gave us a half that we could dip with the Fritos he brought. Tasty and hit the spot after a long day on the trail. After dinner we hung our food bags and went to bed. Enjoy this beautiful planet!",,Preparing for the AT,"Mar 17, Sat",13.20
