Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/485114,"Have been following some of the 2015 folks. Seems like some may have underestmated what they were getting themselves into. Has been quite a winter so far and I hope spring is almost upon up. Good luck to everyone, and especially those on the Warrior Hike. I am preparing for my hike in 2016. I have been trying to hit the gym, but would much rather be in the woods. Planning a long weekend in upstate PA in April, and hopefully at least a week later in the Spring. Still contemplating my retirement date. Can hardly wait to be a full time Fly Fisherman and hiker.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Wed",0

Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518258,"Well, I officially retired from the Army Reserve after more than 30 years, and put my paperwork in to retire from my full time job at the end of the year, which is only a couple of week away. Now it's time to get serious about getting the gear finalized, and get a few major projects completed around the house before I can take off. I had been hoping to do the Warrior Hike in March, but I decided to leave someone withdraw and let someone more deserving have a chance. I have pretty much decided to start somewhere near the mid point and head North in Mid April, then jump back down to GA and come North. I figure to beat the crowds. I attended the ALDHA meeting in Shippensburg this fall, which was a great time and I highly revommend. It was too good to pass up, being 2 blocks from the house. Hope everyone is well and excited about the upcoming hike ad I am. More later.",,View Entry,"Dec 09, Wed",0
Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518558,"Sure has been a warm December. I was hunting in a T-shirt last week, but it was 36 today and made for some cool fly fishing, especially standing in spring water. Anyway, it's supposed to be in the 60's again by New Years. I'm starting to think I might be able to move up my start date, but them would probably get to use those crampons I bought, and the there's the Black Flies in Maine. I do need to finalize my gear and try it all out on a pre-hike. I'm getting anxious to hit the trail, which I imagine will only get worse after I retire in two weeks! Good luck to all!",,Time flys,"Dec 20, Sun",0
Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518920,"Finally retired yesterday. Now I need to to get serious about my preparation. It's been in the 60's for the last few weeks, and now that I am retired it's in the 30's, figures! Still need to get the rest of my gear together, but sometimes I think I should just do like Gene Espey or Grandma Gatewood, and just throw a pillow case over my shoulder and go. Those guys were tough. I think all the light gear has kind of taken much of the challenge away. I still plan on starting at the end of March.","

Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519764,"Spending s lot of time trying to finalize my gear list. Finally settled on a Revelation Quilt over a bag. Have been back and forth on the tent. Was pretty much decided on a Tarptent Double Rainbow, but the saw the Six Moons Trecker or Lunar Duo. Room many choices. I have been doing some local hiking and hope to get the Harpers Ferry to PA done in the next few weeks. I was planning on starting around mid March, but will delay until early April, as my daughter is due in March. I just want to get on the trail, heading North, ahead of the expected crowd. I do admire those of you on the trail now and hope you are prepared and the weather is good to you. Till next time.","

Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521240,"Saw a post on Facebook about Phil (Groundhog) pulling the wool over our eyes to everyone, then the little bastard skipped town two days later, and now he's down in Key West, waiting out the spring thaw! Can't say I blame him, as it's snowing again in PA, and it was near 0 on Saturday night. I'm hoping for a warm-up in the next few weeks, so I can do a couple overnights on the trail in Maryland. Still have a few items of gear to get, but I have pack, tent and sleeping bag, and should be ordering my pad in the next couple of days. Man, there are way too many choices these days! I can remember when you only had a couple of choices, and it was a lot easier to decide. I plan on going with some of my current gear, which may be a taf heavier, but I'm used to carrying a fairly heavy load.",,Weather,"Feb 15, Mon",0
Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524370,"Had a great hike last week. The wife dropped me off at RT 55 (Front Royal) on Thursday, and picked me up at Harper's Ferry on Sunday. The weather was great except for the snow storm on Saturday, which although beautiful, made it hard to find the trail and rather slick. Stayed at Dick's Dome, the Bears Den, and Blackburn Trail Center. Stopped by the ATC HQ's and picked up my hiker tag (2016) and my Flop Flop pin. Hope to get a few more miles in going South before heading North near the end of April. From what I hear, there is a glut of hikers heading this way, and I want to be as far ahead of them as possible, but still avoid the Black Flies in Maine. I've finished from Boiling Springs to Harper's Ferry, and was able to do a good shakedown on my gear. I'm currently at about 32 lbs, including water and food, but should be able to shed a few more pounds. I do hope to make the Flip Flop kick off in Harper's Ferry in a few weeks. Good luck to everyone.","FRONT ROYAL

Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528850,"Left Peters Mountain on 15 April, arrived in Port Clinton today, 19 April. The weather has been great, but hot and dry for April. My Backpacker Pro says 68 miles, but that includes a wrong way and a couple trips down the mountain to springs. As I said, it's been dry, but that is supposed to change on Friday and now it looks like some rain almost every day next week. I'm sure I will miss the dry weather then, as I've walked for days in the rain and it gets old too. Another thing that gets old is the rocks in PA. Coming down the mountain into Port Clinton was a real bear, but I hear the trip up the other side from Hamburg is worse, and I hear it only gets better, just kidding! Makes you wonder if the trail planners weren't a little sadistic! Oh well, all you can do is keep plugging away at it, and try not to get injured. I've been averaging over 15 miles a day, not bad for a sixty year old, but I'm starting to feel it too!","Peters Mountain

Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531521,"Spent the last couple weeks on the trail with Wolfman (PA). Had a great time, but really glad to be about out of the rocks of PA & NJ. Pleasantly surprised by the beauty of Northern Jersey. Have met a lot of great people, such as Pious (NC) Wombat (NY), and Humdinger (CAN). I thought I would be one of the oldest people on the trail, ends up, I am one of the youngest, so far (60).","Port Clinton

Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539105,"Did a slack pack up Moosilauke today with my wife. Probably the best section of trail yet, as it follows a stream and waterfalls for the first few miles and what views! The weather was fabulous.","

Travelinman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605036,"Ended up getting off trail at North Woodstock, due to illness. Did a few sections in in VA in 2017. Completed Springer to Daleville this Spring, then jumped to Maine and started SB on 7 August. Completed Maine 10 September.  Had a great time, met a lot of good people. Glad I'm done! Look forward to doing some sectios again. Some observations: * A lot of hikers are really unprepared for such an understaking, both physically and mentally.*Keep the weight down. I weighed everything, and still carried 30-35 lbs, which was actually pretty good. Just make sure your pack fits well, especially the length. My first pack was 3 inches to long. I finally switched out after 1200 miles, and it was much more comfortable. *This is tough, take your time, build yourself up and don't push it too hard in the beginning. It's a long process, with many opportunities to fail, injuries, burnout, finances. I thought the harded part was being away from family. Don't give up if you don't finish as a Thru-hiker. I met a lot of hikers who have been at it for years. The point is to enjoy the hike! The trail is no going anywhere!Good luck on your hike, pray for good weather, but enjoy the suck!Travelinman!","Katahdin
