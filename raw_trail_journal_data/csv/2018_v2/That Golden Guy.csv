That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581341,"My name is Robby. Think I have done all the planning.  Taking hikes about once per-week in Panthertown National Park (nearby) with my dog Indie. So far she is best selection of two possible, can take her off leash and she stays nearby, returns when called and such. Have 90% of the gear. Opted for mostly stuff I have accumulated over the years and upgraded some to more efficient and lighter editions. Finishing up notes at work for person filling in, notes for wife on who to call, what to do if? Trying to make the final decision on to take or not to take a dog and which one. Just seems if they are a huge part of my life it's the right thing to do or at least try. Done or doing what everyone else is in terms of preparation but not to any extreme. Will do final tweaks as time progresses - use every piece of gear, finalize pack sequence based on daily events, mentally prepare as best I can, physically as best I can but do have attitude of start slow and stay slow until confidence is fully established. I always hike alone. This is MY hike and I never want to compare it to what others are doing or plan to do, how many miles per-day, pack weight, best equipment and such. Always the balance of who or how many people to tell since so many things can change the plans of even the most confident of hikers. That's what makes this the AT--a truly individual experience.

That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581973,"It's sleeting outside, foggy, freezing, a really bad day for anything-except starting another journal entry.  Still have many items to check off on the get ready list. I selected a trail dog - Indie. She will accompany me on the hike. Now need time to get Indie working and comfortable with her new harness and pack. We live next to a national park and have been doing hikes to work on commands, me trying new gear, remembering lessons learned for old hikes. And, it's different when you bring a dog with you. Everything gets a bit more complicated! More research, more planning, more responsibilities, more weight, more things mail drops. more contingency planning -- but will be worth it. I really want to keep this journal interesting for you and me!. I want to avoid how many miles we did, how tough the trail is, how hard things are - I know and expect all that so no use in repeating the obvious. I want to focus on the positive aspects; those things that make you feel good and the end of a long day. So, with that being said I hope you will follow us and provide encouragement - it will be most appreciated.",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Mon",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582703,"Hey, I woke up and saw there is less than a month before we hit the trail. I am wondering about the weather. I expect it to snow in March, it snows every year in March, every journal I have read shows hikers slogging thru the snow. But, it also seems to be snowing every other day around here- now. Most of my pre-hikes in Panthertown Park I have encountered heavy ice, sleet, cold rain. Guess it is a  really good experience to be somewhat miserable on these warm up adventures. Work out the kinks in proper clothing, pace, rest stop intervals and food. Indie always seems in good spirits which, of course, raises my level of feeling good in bad conditions. Its all good! 
The logistics of the hike is coming together. I will detail plan the first 500 miles and leave it at that. From there on I'll do the advance work on zero days. The equipment list is about 95% firm. I am always amazed at the little things that pop up, little nuggets that will help out on the trail. For example, while trying out some dehydrated food, cooked in its container with hot water and placed in a cozy to warm up and get right, I had an epiphany!!  I went to eat out of the package and surprise! My high speed, low drag, ergonomic, super light weight spork was about two inches too short to get anywhere near the bottom of the container. Option cut the bag down as I ate or get a longer spork -- the latter was ordered yesterday. So now no worries as I hunker over a bag of mystery food in blowing snow and can't get to the bottom of the bag due to a defective eating instrument! I shared this revelation with my dog Maxie (one of the Cahill five) and she was happy!",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Mon",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582740,"I thought I would write a bit about what I have been doing for the past 10 years. When I retired the second time, Jeannie and I moved to the mountains of North Carolina from Florida. Looking for something to do, and with absolutely no experience,  I volunteered for the Blue Ridge Free Dental Clinic in Cashiers NC. Originally serving as a Board member and, after that and out of necessity to stay open,  I learned how to be a Dental Assistant to our lead and founding Dentist. Considering we started in the back of a truck to today, a modern clinic, eleven Dentists, two hygienists and  all services free to those who qualify, is simply amazing. The staff here is fully supporting my hike and I greatly appreciate that!  Coupled with Jeannie's support I do not have to worry about that stress point! It is essential to have that for a successful hike. Peace of mind is essential. By the way, we have come a long way since what is in the picture - we use leather head restraints rather than the kid with the towel!The dogs brought it all back to, you know, to the human side.   Luis Carlos Montalvn, Until Tuesday: A Wounded Warrior and the Golden Retriever Who Saved Him",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Wed",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582901,"As I mentioned, I am getting ready for my AT hike by hiking. Lucky enough to live near Panthertown National Park and we try to get a hike in once or twice a week. However, it seems every time we go, its snowing or raining. Which, in a way, is good since the lessons learned can be significant. Does my rain gear work?  Routine to cook food in the rain? Does my pack leak?  How does Indie handle heavy rain?  I would rather go thru that refresher course now than on the AT. The clock is down to 22 days before I turn north and walk-for a long time! Wrapping things up at work. Everyone keeps asking if I'm ready-yes, yes, I am ready.",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Mon",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583050,"A little over two weeks before the adventure starts! Last Thursday I had lunch with Phil and Lynn Barlow. Phil or ""Bald Eagle"" has done over 1,700 miles of the AT and will complete it this year. He came across my journal and shortly thereafter found out we live near each other. One question I asked him was about the ""Virginia Blues"" and does it happen. The answer was a fairly emphatic yes! Apparently when he was completing the Virginia section he endured 21 straight days of rain. I have hiked in bad weather and sometimes for days on end but not 21 straight rain days. I do expect rain, I do expect snow, ice,thunder storms, incessant bugs and heat. I just hope three straight weeks is not in the picture.
On a very sad note, yesterday our founding dog, Cashie, passed away in her sleep. She was 11+ years old, our first Golden Retriever. She traveled to Canada, Alaska, and all over the US with us. Her pups have become Champion Show Dogs, Hunting Dogs, Therapy Dogs, but mostly good old family dogs. She will be missed. But life moves on, Indie, my AT companion is Cashie's daughter. No matter how many years we get with our dogs-it's not enough. Farewell faithful Cashie.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Sun",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583146,"I will be spending tomorrow packing and repacking my backpack. Need to get the right weight distribution, things in the right place to ease finding based on when they will or might be used. And, as usual, trying to reduce any weight. I did replace my 12 year old Feathered Friends down jacket for an 8.3 oz Patagonia Micro Puff Jacket. Its about 2/3's the weight and packs down much smaller. Only problem is - not field tested which could result in a bad situation. It is light and not as puffy as a down jacket, reviews are good --  so I'll see but under trail conditions. Decided to replace my new Camelbak with a Liquid Pack Pro 2 liter camelbak type water holder. The new one, well, after three people, myself included, could not tighten the easy to close top, away it went. The Liquid Pro is pretty simple and closed the first time. I sort of prefer the old wide mouth nalgene bottles as they are multi-use,  to include a nice warm bottle in the bag when its really cold. So, things could change there. The gear list is getting pretty firmed up. Once it is I'll post the final details. I am spending a great deal of time selecting a final base layer shirt. Pretty sure of what I will be wearing around camp, mostly Patagonia stuff. The camp shoes in my gear list are really great, lighter than crocks, and can literally fold in two. I am concerned about the cold so want to have a confident selection in the pack. First aid kits are solid. I have already listed Indies kit. Our vet assisted in its composition as did my MD with mine. Probably overkill but as we all know medical help is not close for emergencies, veterinary assistance even further. Well, enough for now, more to come. Thank you for reading!

That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583384,"Time is FAST approaching! Many feelings late at night-ready? not ready? nervous, gear right? ,how much will I miss my wife and dogs? The thoughts are never ending. We packed several mail drop boxes for about the first 500 miles. I am using some prepper dehydrated food we had at our remote home just to use it. Its a pretty good selection so why not?  After I run out I will be resupplying in towns and not relying on Jeannie. However, our dog Indie will be receiving mail drops pretty much the entire time. I mentioned we are using a high quality, human grade dog food called Honest Kitchen - it too, is a dehydrated mix so easy to use and will maintain her calories. I will do one or two more looks at my pack and what I am taking to see if any reductions can happen. Other than a weather change I think I am close.  I'll be carrying a little more than I want since I am sharing Indie's stuff until she gets her ""trail legs"".  Hopefully the full pack weight will be around 25-28 pounds. Indie's pack should be about 8-10 pounds.
I have one more day of work. The remaining time before we depart on March 6 is for fine tuning for both hike and home. I have made an extensive list for Jeannie on who to call, what to do, where things are, what bills paid automatically and, in general, the things I do. Hopefully it will serve her well and eliminate some problems. OK, time to go. 
Again, thanks for reading.",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Tue",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583494,"Spent much of the morning loading my pack for the final weigh in. Laid everything out and starting loading. It is fully packed and ready to go for a 3.5 day hike. The total weight came in at 30.4 pounds which is about 2.4 pounds heavier than anticipated. So, where could I drop a pound or two? I do have one or two clothing items that I could do without. But this is a winter pack, a little heavier, should I risk not having what I feel comfortable with? For example; I have the Micro Puff jacket for very cold conditions and camp wear, a lighter jacket for hiking in the 20-30 degree range (over a base layer) and the Zpack Rain Jacket.  If it were summer I would lose one of the first two - but its winter. Oh the things hikers worry about for hours and hours! I did review (again) the items and was able to drop or move a few things so weight is now right at 29 pounds.
I took a series of about 7 videos of what I am taking. I'll post them to the Video section tomorrow. For dog people it will also contain a breakdown of Indies pack and contents. Hers weighed in a 4.4 pounds which is actually much lighter than anticipated. I am carrying some of her food in my pack. She could carry another 2-3 pounds and still be way below the ""recommended"" body weight to pack weight ratio which is the norm. Most previous dog hikers said the average was 25% but actually kept it around 10%-15%. Indie weighs about 57 pounds (I think).
Still pretty nervous in anticipation of starting. It has been raining for weeks here and I expect it will be raining when I start of even a light snow. I have pretty much done all I can do. The time is now. I am ready. Having some technical problems with Trail Journals mostly about pictures and videos but they should be resolved soon.",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Thu",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584037,"We are at Amicalola State Park at the Visitors Center. We were directed to a small room just outside the center that had a paper sign on it stating ""Thru Hikers Check In"". Inside two rangers, a small table with a lady handing out AT tags and maintaining a resister log. I logged in, number 716. There were 5-6 others seated in chairs asking questions. I glanced at the register log which contained name, trail name, weight of pack and destination.  Packs weights varied 22-25-28-29 and such. I annotated ""30"" and slunk away having what appeared to be the heaviest pack. Of course many people define pack weight as everything except food and water (two of the heavy items in any pack) so I took some of the weights with a grain of salt. This is winter - in the 20's- more clothes, heavier sleeping bag and such. That being done, we went to the lodge to check in.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Tue",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584038,"Opted for a cabin-pretty basic but OK. The lodge brought back old memories. Jeannie and I have been here twice. One some 22 years ago when, being the romantic guy I am, suggested for our Honeymoon we a hike along the AT. She agreed having NEVER hiked a single day in her life. we hiked for six weeks. We started in August and conditions were pretty good until week six and the snow started. It was a slow pace, usually setting up a tent inside a shelter since there were very few hikers about. Jeannie did not take to the shelter mice and their antics like eating her gorp thru her pack! That, my friends was 22 years ago!
So, next event was to ride up to parking lot, walk the mile in, touch the plague and head back to the cabin. I have the directions to the parking lot in the pictures section. Mileage marks are a little off, but you will get there. tomorrow the start.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Tue",0
That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584039,"So, Indie and I touched the start and off we went. In the parking lot there were 10+ hikers in some sort of preparation to launch. You can't but compare yourself and stuff to the other hikers and their stuff. Experienced, not experienced, slow, fast, light pack, heavy pack, older or younger, man, woman and on and on. What was beginning to creep into my mind and would grow in the next few days was how many hikers are out. This may not be as solitary as I had thought. I tend to hike alone by choice, we'll see. 
Hugged and kissed my sweetheart and off we went. Indie already having made friends with several hikers - meaning getting treats-took the lead. The day was pretty cold and windy. As we pressed on the trail grew more difficult. I was quickly reminded-""hey, you just started, wait until you see what I have in store for you!"" We took our time, took many many short breaks. I passed some and many passed me. Some of the younger guys just blasting thru without saying a word, which bothers me.
I will admit it was much harder than I anticipated. Indie was great. She would take the front, get about 20 feet ahead, sit down, look back and seem to say ""you OK? This is fun! Come on old man"" Pulled into the tent camp site. Took the first spot, set the tent up in very windy weather, threw everything into the tent, blew up the air mattress, laid down the sleeping bag and laid down to recover. About 5:30 I heated water for Indies meal of Honest Kitchen. Thank God that part is easy - warm water, mix, serve, doggie eats and is happy. I'm too cold so I skip dinner (not good). than the problems began-ground at angle, bad slips off pad, wind blows thru tent at will (bad tent selection) and foremost - Indie is very cold, shivering! This is totally unexpected. Whatever the reason she shivers, I pile on my extra clothes, still shivering, try and stuff her into my sleeping bag. Some success there but now I am cold. 
We got thru the night but need to make some type of change. Weather has been in 20's and wind chill has to be close to single digit. Off we will go tomorrow.","Springer Mountain

That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584045,"Wow, two mountains named Sassafras and Justus taught me an early lesson. I hope the legs start adjusting soon because this is not easy. It's impossible to rethink back 22 or 14 years ago when I hiked this same spot, not with ease, but not with this much 'help me God!"" prayers I was stumbling along in a bubble with three or four hikers who were experiencing the same difficulties. We literally leap frogged each all the way up and down. There was a fairly stiff wind blowing with temps in the low-30's making travel both hot and cold. My problem, which has always existed, is the I was born to sweat. Twenty degrees? Not a problem I can sweat thru my hiking shirt like a marathon runner in the summer's heat. I have a fairly straight forward routine of being able to shed the base layer and put on something dry in a flash. This is normally done as soon as the pack drops in the camp area. 
I haven't taken many pictures at all since it has been too cold to take the time or expend the energy. I focus only on one step at a time and where is Indie. I cannot make journal entries unless I am warm (which hasn't happened so far) or unless staying in an Inn or Hostel.
Some lessons learned: bad tent selection for cold and windy weather. I would go with a single wall tent such as Black Diamond which I will get after I feel confident in my hike. I used one for 20+ years when they were called Bibler Tents. No wind blowing thru unless you use top vents. Second lesson: Indie doesn't do the 24 inch footbridges-she seems to be afraid to walk across them and goes thru the stream instead. Third: Indy does exceptionally well during the day but is having difficulty with the nights regardless of how much I pile on top of her. Thirdly: I cannot tolerate the cold as well as in the past. There is no place to take shelter from it except in the sleeping bag. I do have the right clothes but when the bones are cold-it takes a while to warm those boys up. 
Again, on the personal downside, are the sheer number of hikers about and its not even prime time. This is not a walk in the woods seeking the meaning of life, its constantly looking behind to see how many are coming and when we need to move over. So far this is one of the eye openers from my last hike on AT some 14 years ago. Time to go.

That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584103,"Tough day, early start and pounded it out. I most likely, no, rather,  I overdid it. I haven't taken to staying in the shelters as of yet. Too many people, too many tents. As I mentioned previously there are many, many people here with many more to come. I will have to adjust to this situation. Another reason to tent is not everyone loves dogs,even Golden Retrievers - that has become obvious and I am well aware of that fact. Indie still having challenges with the night. Hopefully can find some remedy to the situation. The mountains are cold. Sun may come out but wind blows constantly. Wind chill is something to take quite seriously. \looking forward to getting WARM! Only about 3 miles tomorrow and rest time - probably longer than originally thought.","Blackwell Creek Campsite

That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584107,"Short but demanding day - but being motivated by a nice rest, warmth, sleep does help. Trod up Blood Mountain, one foot in front of the other, head down, poles swinging in assistance, Indie moving well, packs hurts needs major adjustments. Finally on top! The shelter there has always reminded me of something out of the Blair Witch Project - spooky. As usual it was very very crowded inside and out. No reason to stay here. Only a tad over a mile to relief - but wait! Old Man AT wants to make sure you enjoy your walk out by throwing in some slammer down hill sections guaranteed to make your knees quiver like a young man on his first date. And it doesn't help that after years in the Marine Corps I have undergone knee surgery and rehab multiple times.
Finally at Neel's Gap. Craig the Inn Keeper is on his way, the picture is of the Inn where I will be staying. Wind is horribly cold, must be 30 + hikers milling around outside and more coming and going. The ""Shoe Tree"" is bending under the weight of hundreds of boots and trail shoes tossed on its branches as a final F--U for those that have had enough. I can""t blame them, this has been a horrible start. Maybe its because my last AT adventure was 14 years ago and I am now 71 years old. I need a serious rest. So, be seeing you later.

That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584661,"Sorry for such a long delay between journals.Much has happened in the past week or so.After I got to Neels Gap I needed two days rest. The weather was still forecasted as high winds, rain, sleet possibly snow.After needed rest We started back at Neels only to again encounter adverse weather. Funny that rest days were fine! Again she handled the hiking days great. Nighttime wasn’t so good. Again, a poor tent selection on my part was not helping the situation. Two more days of this and enough was enough! I called my wife who was at a dog show for advice. It baffled both of us as all our dogs love the snow and never showed any cold weather problems. Jeannie was committed for a few more days. However, the AT passed thru many forest service roads and there are shuttle services that will, for a price, pick you up. I called, they came, and back to the Inn to await Indies pickup by Jeannie. At some point we do hope to bring her back on the trail. I do miss her-particularly when, on steep climbs, where she gets ahead of me, sits down and looks into my eyes and seems to say: “Come on old man, you can make it.”","Neels Gap

That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584666,"Sorry for the delay in journal entries.  I am really remiss in this area. Basically, by days end : there is no signal, I am too tired (usual reason) or I simply forget. I had to fiddle with the mileage to get where I am today.
Where am I ? Today I am at the Nantahala Mountain Lodge after the worse night of my hiking life. It snowed 1-6 inches depending what section of Trail I was on. Winds up to 40 mph! Walking was ok, keep moving keep warm. First part of hike was uphill (slow) but warm, last half was down (still slow but button  up).
Found a tent site area around 3:00-anyplace would do. Finally got tent up with extreme difficulty. Tossed everything in, put on all available clothing, got in bag and the day was done. For me this was close to dangerous stuff. As a young man it would have been an adventurous day. When you are in your seventies- well things take on a slightly different perspective- to me that is, maybe not you.
Got thru the night, saw in the Guidebook there was a lodge somewhat nearby that did pickups on a forest road only a mile or so away. And, the rest is history.
I really don’t know what the future holds. I get on Trail - weather is BAD. I get off trail- weather is FINE!
Physically I’m doing worse than anticipated. I try to keep miles down. But old man AT keeps putting these obstacles called mountains in my way-all uphill! And the weather is not helping.
Well enough. Thanks for reading.","

That Golden Guy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585041,"I made it to NOC and rented a 4 person bunk house for myself. I needed time to think over how the first 3+ weeks had gone. After much reflection I came to certain conclusions I wanted to refine and think thru. In no particular order:Planning this hike was fun and challenging. Buying and trying new gear but mostly using my old stuff.It was fun to do pre-hike training with my dog in Panthertown park.It was fun to talk about the GREAT time I had in 2004 (trail name Lopaka still in Trailjournals).Much of my attitude came from the 2004 hike. It was a great time.It was fun to start with my dog on 7 March while my wife waived goodby.It was not a good feeling to continually see so many hikers on the trail-one after another they would pass by. The majority saying nothing, just pass by. Very few took time slow down,say hello,where you going, where you from? This was very predominate in years past, hikers used to be more social. When you got to a shelter or campsite you sort of knew someone.It was not fun to see my dog suffer in the cold at night. she was great during the day but the freezing temps at night (even wrapped in my extra clothes) did not help. She shivered uncontrollable. She had the best food, pack, equipment. Eventually, my wife met me and Indie went home to maybe try another day.I stayed at campsites to avoid shelters. I heard complaint after complaint about shelter life. Too loud, late hours, smoking,and  ""smoking"" all happening. I am sure there were others that none of this happened but the frequency I heard \ saw about it was discouraging. I stayed mainly in shelters in 2004 and still have great memories.Hikers and more hikers on the trail-where did they all come from? As a slow hiker I never seemed to be alone,someone always coming, coming from behind. Not what I envisioned. There are apparently over 4,000 who are attempting in 2018. Look at the window and do the math.To sum it up it was, for me, like going to my high school reunion and everything, everyone had changed. I did not have the comradship, the enjoyment, motivation I anticipated. Physically it was demanding but it always was and will be. Snow,sleet,rain, high winds, freezing temps---that's just part of the AT, live with it. However, I did learn that what used to be an adventure (snowing and pitching a tent in freezing sleet) didn't quite give me the same macho challenge it did when I was younger. Now it was more like survival!!So, I lost my motivation, my desire to thru hike. It's not there and without that the suffering simply is not worth the challenge. Loseing my dog Indie and the support Honest Kitchen dog food was providing to keep her well nourished was dishearting. Her departure was heart breaking to me. She did all she could do.So, that's it, that's my story. No, I don't feel good about not achieving a 45 year old goal.  But as the saying goes: better to have tried and failed than to have failed to try.Sorry always remember- hike your own hike, travel your own journey.","
