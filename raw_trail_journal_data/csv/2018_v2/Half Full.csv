Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583089,"Well, as the first entry in this eternal tracking of an epic adventure, I guess I should make it epic... I had a bunch of background information about why I'm hiking, etc. but realized it should go in the ""About Hike"" section, so if you are having trouble falling asleep, head there!
Anyway, update that I have started the process of planning and getting gear. Yes, I know there are some people out there that totally nerd about and getting excited about this stuff, but it doesn't really interest me. I just want to go! Maybe because I'm a big-picture guy, not detail oriented.
But now I've picked an official start date (April 26!), and started getting the items I don't already own (so basically everything). So it's really feeling ""real"". Luckily I have a friend that knows about this stuff so he is my consultant. I was hoping to be a little further along now , but oh well.
There have been days I am super excited to take on this adventure, and others I feel more reluctant... but overall now it is basically getting to a point of just accepting the fact I am doing it.
The first question everyone asks me is, ""Are you going with anyone?"" And my answer is always no. I feel personally that would be limiting for me, as I want to go at my own pace/schedule and wouldn't want to cater to anyone else (or have them cater to me). Maybe this is selfish, but I feel you meet people along the way that are the same pace and either stay with them or separate.
The second question (assuming they are aware there are no grizzlies in the east) is ""What are you doing afterwards?"" And my answer is always ""see where the trail takes me"". So on that note, let's see where this blog takes me!",,Life (Rhonda Vincent reference!),"Feb 19, Mon",0

Didn't realize this feature was missing, in fact this whole site doesn't seem like it's been updated in a while but oh well. There is an orange link in the bottom right that says RSS that somehow involves subscribing to something, so might try that!
Anyway...=I have been based out of my parent's house near Charleston, SC for the last few weeks, which has been...interesting. They have been very gracious to let me stay here and hook me up, but also it is interesting living with rules (""where are you going?"" ""why are you lighting that on fire?""). Also it is SUPER flat here (they call it the Lowcountry) so the closest mountains are a few hours away.

The last few weeks in Durham were pretty hectic, both logistically and emotionally. Had to wrap up everything at both the Red Cross and my place, and there didn't seem to be enough hours in the day to do it all! Both my friends and coworkers/volunteers were very generous and gave me many gifts which will help.

So I have been finalizing all my gear, training hikes, etc. Can see the latest copy of my gear list at https://docs.google.com/spread... and needless to say is STILL a work in progress. I wasn't ultralight by any means, but was hovering around 11/12 pounds base weight. Now I'm at 14! And that is not including all of the clothes I will probably pack. I did substitute a few things out for comfort over weight, so can always switch back.I did make a decision pretty late in the game to throw out my previous budget, so if I had a little more time could have explore some of the UL cottage industry like Tarptent, ULA, Zpacks, Gossamer Gear, etc. Oh well.So we are driving to the area this Saturday (the 21st) and I will officially start the AT (not doing the Approach Trail) on April 22nd. This is great because it is Earth Day, and also 22 is a good number for me (and in my 33rd year - great start!).I'm sure there's more to say but gotta wrap everything up. Next post will be from the trail!",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Thu",0
Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588326,"Wow I can’t believe it but I’m finally on the AT and It’s been a crazy few days!
On Saturday, I drove with my parents to Amicalola Falls and stayed the night in the lodge. Was sunny and beautiful. Had a big buffet dinner.
 The next morning it wasn’t even hungry, but had a bit of food at breakfast. We drove down to the visitor center which is also where thru-hikers register. I was #2379, meaning that 2,379 through hikers have officially registered at Amicalola this year (technically it’s optional). The trail has gotten so popular, they now have an orientation about leave no trace principles, etc. Good idea, but there was stuff I needed to figure out and it was 95% stories about bears. Did demonstrate the PCT style bear bag hang which was interesting.
Since you can’t really drive to the beginning of the trail, there are two options: take the approach trail from the visitor center or drive about a mile past the beginning and hike back in. We had decided earlier we would pick the latter option so my parents could join me for the first mile and I had heard bad things about the approach trail which isn’t technically blazed and part of the AT. But when the Ranger heard this, he said that the road was washed out and tough to pass in a car. So we decided I would do the approach trail, which was basically 9 miles uphill and added an extra day before a food resupply (Even though not officially part of the trail, I am including the mileage). Luckily they had a hiker box, which is basically free stuff (often times extra food) hikers leave for each other.
I walked a bit with my parents, and then started with a few other guys that were in the training. Later I wouldn’t know them as Dozer, Headbanger, and Fartender.It was gray, but the falls were beautiful. I had heard bad things about the stairs, but they weren’t bad at all. About halfway up, it started to rain and get rather steep finally turning into a downpour. Fartender and I pushed on and he was super fast. By the time we got to the actual Southern Terminus sign and first white blazes, could barely see anything. Unfortunately I didn’t get a photo there. There was a shelter about a fifth of a mile up so we just pushed on to there.It was actually a huge complex… Had to privies and two bear boxes (bears have figured out the cables). With the low visibility and spread out layout, it took us a while to find the actual shelter.  I wasn’t expecting cold wet weather, so my hands and body in general were freezing. When we got there we were one of the first ones there and it wasn’t very big. Long story short, by the end of the night there were about 18 people in a space meant  for 12 including a dog and a five year old. I don’t know why overnighters would stay there in April, but there were a bunch of people that were not thru or long section hikers. The wind picked up and by the end of the night I think was about 40 or 50 mph. It kept hitting one of the bear cables that would then slammed into the side of the shelter. Between being so crammed in and the weather, needless to say I was not happy and barely slept.I had serious doubts about whether I actually wanted to do this, or I could just get picked up the next day!Also, to clarify, shelters are usually three sided wooden structures with room for about 6 to 12 people to sleep in and are located about every 5 to 15 miles along the trail.","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Everyone was standing around getting ready and I wanted to get out of that negative space so badly. Even though it was still raining a little bit and the trail was full of puddles, I was so happy to get fresh air and out of there.
Dozer, joined me within a mile or two and Also expressed how about the night was and how he was having second thoughts. He is not technically a thru hiker, but will be going to Harpers Ferry which is about halfway. Which then joined two girls that had been the first to leave the shelter. They originally from Texas but actually now live not too far from Durham! I believe they are doing a long section as well. We got to the shelter pretty early, and stop for lunch but since it was bad weather again decided to stay the night.  The other young hikers from the first night - Banana Boy, Headbanger, and Amy, joined as well so we hung out for a while. I think everyone else from that shelter decided to stay again since it was have been so bad. There  was an “interesting” gentleman that was at Hawk Mountain when we got there doing a zero day (not going anywhere). He started snoring about 6pm even though we were all loudly talking and didn’t stop until morning. About 6am Dozer was like Well, we might as well get up! So another early day. Really cemented our dislike for staying in shelters. Oh and I might have a trail name now…  Half Full!

We had to cross a couple creeks that I think would normally be that bad because of all the rain were really high. I just walked through in my shoes, since they were soaked anyway but was glad I had my trekking poles for balance.  we stopped at the Gooch mountain shelter for lunch, and the two girls from North Carolina join shortly after. They were a few people that had stayed in the shelter print the previous night still waking up, so it was nice talking with them. Those are decided to press on ahead and not eat lunch, so once I I continued on my own and the craziest thing happened - Sun came out for about 10 minutes! Everyone cheered! I caught up to Dozer and  we reached Woody Gap. We had already gone 12 miles, and since it was still the first week didn’t want to push too much further. One of the guys guides showed campsites there, but the only ones we saw were right by a major road and pretty exposed.  There was a guy that offered to take us to a town, but we didn’t really want to stay in a hostile or end up somewhere random. We kind of stood around awkwardly debating what to do for a while, I think being dehydrated and hungry probably didn’t help. Finally we decided to press on and just stop at the first good stuff camping site we saw. Not but 10 feet on the trail, there was a side trail to a small creek. There were a few spots good enough for stealth camping so we just decided to stop there. Stealth Camping means you set up in an area that has not been previously used and try to not leave a trace you’ve been there. Unfortunately it was not the most level ground, and I decided to put my feet up words since that is good to do after hiking. Unfortunately, with the combination of the Therma rest sleeping pad, quilt,and my tent I kept sliding down. So another bad night. Headbanger, Banana Boy, and Fartender ended up at the same spot but just camped on that trail, since it was level and not official one.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

About 8 miles in, we hit blood mountain which was the steepest uphill yet. The view from the top was amazing and it had a cool stone shelter from the 1930s. We sat on a rock and had lunch, and in about 15 minutes there were five different groups of day hikers all up there. The views down were even more incredible. Since the trees haven’t or leafed out yet, there are actually a lot more views than in the late spring/summer.The trail then crossed Neel Gap.  This is a well-known spot, because it is the first major highway the trail crosses so people that quit can get picked up there. It also crosses through a store/hostel called Mountain Crossings. They will give a free shakedown, Which basically means going through all your gear and telling you what to send home. People often leave there with bags 20 pounds lighter! They had a great hiker box, but when we got there the power was out and had to shop by headlamp. I needed to resupply food and also get a few gear items so I didn’t do the shakedown but actually left with a higher pack weight! Still under 25 pounds for about 3 to 4 days of food so I’m not worried. We actually spent a few hours there, and didn’t want to spend the night in the hospital so he went on about a mile to a campsite.","Woody Gap

I met up with a couple of hikers, Big Money and Wes.  Big money had actually already done harpers ferry to Katahdin so is now doing this half. Then it started to really downpour during some steep inclines and descents. Dozer And I rolled into the Lowgap shelter pretty early, but it seemed already full. The tent sites around there were flooded and it was really depressing to go on, so we weren’t sure what to do.  But it turns out that not everyone there was staying so there was room for a couple more. Those are decided to press on and I just wasn’t feeling it so I stayed there. I wasn’t super excited for that as it was super crowded, but I just couldn’t go back out in the rain. I was a little disappointed in myself, as I knew the weather was already a weakness for me and I would have to set up my tent in the rain at some point.  The other three came and eat lunch and also decided to press on that’s none of them like shelters! There were two young guys that were really cool, one just ran the Boston Marathon and the other had never really liked in his life and with keeping up with him. They were doing like 15 to 20 mile pace already! I’m not too worried though, trying to keep it slow early and can always increase. There were also a couple of cool people there, and a ridge runner which is either a volunteer or paid employee of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy which manages the trail.Big surprise, I have a little room and couldn’t sleep!","Bull Gap

It was cold and foggy in the morning, but I decided not to put on warm clothes and push through it to go faster. I also took the rubber tips of my poles so got really good traction in the dirt.  The terrain was pretty flat, and I ended up passing both a group of three guys and dozer by 10am.  We all arrived at the Blue mountain shelter together which had great views and a lot of people packing up. Someone had even put out carrots and rehydrated hummus which was amazing to get “fresh” food.  The sun was finally out and it was beautiful views all day. Dozer rested at Unicoi Gap and I pressed on eating a beautiful lunch at top Rocky Mountain.  There must not have been more than one or two people that walk by in an hour. It’s kind of funny too because since there are so few people out, I’m starting to get to know everyone and will be surprise when I see a new face .  We ended up pushing all the way on to the tree mountain shelter which ended up being over 15 miles and three big up/downs for me. But to be honest I haven’t felt sore yet. A little pain in my knees but that’s it. Granted it’s been less than a week, so there still lots of time and I will continue to take it relatively slow.

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588867,"Woke up to a beautiful sunrise and started hiking alone. Met up with Fartender and Banana Boy for the rest of the way. We were only headed to Dicks Creek Gap to hitch a ride into Hiawassee. But those last few miles seemed to drag on. It had only been a week since real food and didn’t have the hiker hunger yet, but still wanted something fresh. When we made it to the gap, we realized quickly hitching would not be very successful as it is around a blind curve with cars going 6mph. It was a popular place with a parking lot, so we figured eventually one of the cheap shuttle drivers would stop by. We started talking with a group of section hikers from Alabama and one of them was like “oh, towns only 10 miles away? We are waiting for the rest of our group, I can take you!” It was really the first ‘Trail magic’ I experienced. Trail magic is basically when someone in the community does something really nice for a thru hiker. Usually it will involve handing out food on the trail, but since I’m sort of later in the season haven’t seen yet.
Anyway, she dropped us off at the Budget motel where we all decided to get singles. It looked like crap from the outside so I didn’t have high expectations, but wasn’t bad. I still slept in my sleeping bag liner and wore shower shoes just in case!
After checking in, I went to a beer/burger place next door where I met a couple of girls from Maryland who are also thru hikers. They were super cool couple who ended up being in the motel room next to me! And that now makes 3 female thru hikers I’ve met out of 100!
It was nice out and I was antsy, so decided to walk around the town (hadn’t walked in a while!). It is not super hiker focused, more of a poor southern Appalachian town with some rich houses on a lake. But everyone was super nice. When I got back I hing up a bunch of stuff to dry out, did laundry, deep cleaned cook pot, etc. the fun chores. Since I didn’t bring an extra change of clothes, I had to wear my jacket and rain skirt (yes what it sounds like) while doing laundry which was fun...
 Later all of us (the usual 4 other guys and now the female couple) went to the burger place again and I think closed the place down! To be honest I wasn’t that hungry as had a late lunch and haven’t been putting in big days yet.

I still woke up early of course because my body sucks. Made a run to Ingles (grocery store) where I realized I suck at shopping. Definitely got too much/stupid stuff. Fartender was like “it’s not that hard, you count the miles to next resupply,figure out how many days, and get breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks for those days”. But it is still hard for me, so overwhelmed. Maybe the smaller stores are better. None of us were ready for the motel’s 11am shuttle to take us back to trailhead, so we called a private shuttle who was super nice. Turned it into an easy near-zero mile day, or “Nero” to camp at the next shelter. Headbanger and Banana Boy decided to stay an extra day and take a zero.
Unfortunately, when we got there I realized I had left my filter on Banana Boy’s room in town. That makes the following things I’ve lost/left behind:
- water filter
-iPod Shuffle with headphones
-collapsible spork that fits well I my pot
Ugh. At least for the short termi can borrow others’ filters until I can meet up with Banana at the NOC.

I took a blue blaze path that I thought it was the trail, and went down the mountain for about half a mile before giving up. After the long hot trek back in my warm sleeping clothes, I realize there were is another blue blaze trail that went right to water!

Haven’t gotten many blisters on my feet (knock on wood) either. There was a cool section hiker there that talk to us for a while. The first few days all of the older people were annoying, but the last few have met some really cool. Weird.At lunch we stopped at a shelter and I had to use the privy.

When we got to Winding Stair Gap, Dozer’s dad (who lives in Brevard about an hour away) has just pulled up. I think originally, dozer was just going to stay there a day and maybe even invite us, but his wife ended up coming and he was taking a few days off. His dad dropped us off in town(at a brewery of course) and we said bye. It’s been great having Dozer as a hiking partner and will miss him. Hopefully can catch up later on.We were at Lazy Hiker brewery, which is pretty well-known on the trail. All of their beers are themed (I.e. slackpack IPA, Wesser evil porter). They had just opened for the day, so were talking a lot with the bartenders. We were hoping that had been started by through hikers, but unfortunately apparently owned by a bunch of corporate bigwigs. Oh well, I guess ignorance is bliss!Fartender’s girlfriend was actually driving up to meet him, So I headed to the hostel on my own. It was actually owned by the same people as the budget hotel in Hiawassee, and as it was a cheap hostel I had low expectations. However, it wasn’t bad at all. It was a 4 bunk room with a private bathroom and shower, and there was only one other guy in there.I didn’t catch his name, but he was very nice.As soon as I walked in, they handed me a beer so mixed with the brewery earlier was feeling pretty happy :).  I walk to the local outfitter, which of course had a bar in the back. Then for some reason, I decided this would be a good time to go grocery shopping. There was actually a natural food store about a mile away, so I walked there and then a Mexican grocery, followed by Ingles. I only needed enough food for a few days to make it to the NOC, but ended up getting way too much food. Lesson learned: Don’t go grocery shopping at multiple locations after a few beers while you’re already hungry!I walked a while around their main St., Franklin is actually a really cool town. You could definitely see the difference between Hiawassee, which is a town that happens to be near the trail and Franklin which is super hiker friendly.I ended up getting dinner at the food truck next to the brewery, and ended up seeing people I knew that so of course had to join them.

Laundry only takes about an hour when you have such few clothes:). I also printed my backcountry permit for the smokies, which is basically good for 30 days so I have some flexibility.
The shuttle back to the trailer wasn’t even until 11, So I grabbed a big breakfast at roly-poly’s restaurant. There are about four other guys on the shuttle, but were going to a different spot on the trail. The shuttle driver, Ron Havens, and is definitely a personality. He went from singing a Waylon Jennings song to talking about the local sheriff to I don’t even know what!
When I got off, there are a couple of other guys getting dropped off by a shuttle but they were super fast. So I spent the morning mostly by myself which was a new experience. Not but a mile after the gap, I saw my first snake! Luckily I don’t think it was a rattler and scurried away quickly. I think that is the first wildlife I’ve seen apart from birds, insects, and rodents. My pack was super heavy with all the food, but I still try to keep a good pace. The top of Siler bald was a nice meadow, and of course I did the quarter-mile extra uphill to the summit which probably wasn’t worth it. I met a nice group from Florida that are doing a section hike and saw again a few times. Since I didn’t have my water filter, I was using iodine tablets but I didn’t  trust them because all they did was turn the water brown. Granted, it was from a spring so probably OK but I didn’t wanna take my chances and probably got a little dehydrated. My plan was to stop after a few miles, but just kept on going.

She is planning to through hike next year, starting at Harpers Ferry in the spring and doing a flip-flop so getting the best weather.I passed a group of about 15 older day hikers having lunch at an overlook, looked like they got bussed in from a senior center.

I saw the mom again later, and apparently she had accidentally knocked one over!Took a steep blue blazed side trail past a work crew up to Rocky Bald for lunch.

I cooked, took care of chores and hung my bag. About an hour later, I realized I had a few wrappers inside my pocket plus my cook pot.

I got to the NOC around 11, just in time for the restaurant to switch to their lunch menu so I could get a burger. Went to the outfitter and general store, which was a bit more catered to rafting tourists than through hikers. I didn’t recognize a lot of people around, but didn’t see Admiral Awesome which had been a while. As I was leaving, he said he was headed out to but was also sitting drinking beer so I know how that goes. It is really nice to jump in the river, but since the skies were growing darker I decided to get a move on. It was only 8 miles to the next shelter, but it was all uphill so I bit rough. Not a mile past the NOC was the Wade Sutton memorial for a fallen firefighter. Someone had placed an interesting note there as well so I stop for a bit to reflect.

He was an EMT and wildland firefighter, so had some interesting stories. All of the good campsites around the shelter were taken, and since it was supposed to rain I figured I would tent on the ridge so the water would drain down. I think RVA slept in the packed shelter. I set up my tent next to a cool couple from Florida, the woman had hiked a long section of the AT a couple of years ago. It was a bit windy setting up my tent, but I was able to get everything staked and bear bag line hung in not too long. Since I am still learning about the Tiger Wall, I figured it would be good practice to ensure I made everything taut and secure. Definitely put out all the guy lines. Fartender came up, he had been putting in some big days to catch up after his zeros. Was nice to see a familiar face from the original crew.It started to get dark, and when I went to hang my bear bag I realized it was sitting pretty low. So I took that line down and started searching for another tree. I had a couple options but none of them really worked out. At this point it was pitch black and started to rain. I ran back to my tent to put everything inside and went back to the tree I was working on. Not sure how this happened, but in all the chaos somehow the line was hanging with the full bag on it, but was twisted up so I couldn’t pull it up or down. So here’s me in the dark and pouring rain, trying to figure out how to get it down and everyone was asleep. It wasn’t a very big tree, but even tried climbing which probably wasn’t the best idea. The bag wasn’t that high off the ground, so I tried jumping and bringing it down. But what I ended up basically doing was breaking the carabiner and tearing the top of the bag from the rest of it. I wasn’t exactly sure what to do at this point, so I tried to close the back up and hang it on a nearby tree and hope for the best.

The lightning and thunder seemed like it just feet away. I also realized that I forgot to stake the rain fly right by my head, only the most important one! I probably slept about four hours, when I woke it was misty and windy but not pouring anymore. I was so out of it, I put everything except the tent in my bag and walked down to the shelter just to be away from the elements. The tents down there definitely got wetter than mine, but they were blocked from the wind so were able to easily break down camp. I had some cold oatmeal and kind of watched everyone from the shelter get up, get ready and leave. It was like I was just paralyzed and couldn’t process anything. I lied down for a second and considered taking a zero, but wasn’t really sure what I would do for a whole foggy day there. I finally decided to cook some warm oatmeal, which seem to help and finally mustered up the courage to break down my tent. There were a bunch of people coming in to have breakfast so they motivated me as well. It was really hard trying to break down my tent in the wind, but I finally got it to a place where I could hide behind a tree from the wind and bag it all up. I think I finally got out of that shelter around 11 and still wasn’t doing great. I walked out with Packman, who was very nice but a large slow fellow with a big bag. Passed him, And basically hiked alone to Stecoah Gap. I was going to eat lunch there, but on the picnic tables a church from Robbinsville had left bananas and little snack packs. Official trail magic! There was a trash can there too (yes these things are super exciting for backpackers) but it was overflowing. I talked with and hiked out with the Indoor Kid, but he slowed down so I went ahead. Here was Jacobs Ladder, a notorious climb up. It was definitely steep (there were times I was walking on my tiptoes), but it was only half a mile and not that bad. Someone said it used to be worse, but they added switchbacks at the top now. I hit the shelter pretty early, and indoor kid showed up a bit later. We stopped to have lunch and fill water, and were debating staying or continuing on. There were not a lot of good campsites, so indoor kid pressed on. After the night/morning I had was waffling but decided to stay. More of just a chance to regroup mentally in addition to drying out my tent and footprint. About an hour later Rob, who I had shared a hostel with in Franklin showed up later and decided to tent. He offered to hang my bear bag (what had been my clothes dry bag) with his since I had left my line and carabiner in all of the craziness the previous night. Then a big group arrived within an hour of each other - two older women from Australia and 3 kids from Philly. Could tell they had great banter and we all watched the sunset then slept in the shelter together. It was a great evening and exactly what I needed for a fresh restart!","Sassafras Gap Shelter

I woke up at 4 AM and put in earplugs and slept all the way until 8! The latest I’ve slept in so far, think I needed it. I left with the Aussies and Philly crew but got ahead of them. I was feeling motivated after having a short/lame day and booked it the first few miles, ended up catching The Indoor Kid and Lawn Chair. You could get peeks of Fontana Lake, but no good views.When I got to the Marina/Hwy 28 crossing around 2, Rob and a couple other guys were there. A shuttle was on the way to take to the Village where there was restaurant, laundry, store, etc. So I waited a few minutes and the van pulled up. It was 3 dollars for a ride that was only a couple miles, but I didn’t like my hitching chances so went in. The laundry was free so did that right away to jump ahead of people. So I was walking around in my jacket and rain skirt, which provided ample conversation. I saw some familiar faces like Peaches, Aing, Fartender, etc. and resupplied at the store. Someone had a bottle of orange juice that looked so good I downed a whole gallon!Peaches was going to the shelter on the shuttle and offered to take my full backpack so I could slackpack the mile from the road to the shelter (called the Fontana Hilton which I will describe later). Super nice of her. I finished everything and went up to the restaurant at the lodge where I saw Banana Boy, Fartender, and Drop Bear (cool guy from Australia). I wanted to sit by myself and update blog with their WiFi but the group wouldn’t let me sit by myself. After a couple beers and nachos (with fake cheese:( later, Indoor Kid and Lawn Chair stopped by and said the shelter and tent sites around it were filling up. We weren’t sure exactly what our stealth camping options were given so much private property, so I went back to get the shuttle. I wasn’t really thinking, and when I got off the shuttle, it was at the shelter. So I never actually did the miles from Highway 28 to the Hilton. Oh well. The Fontana Dam Shelter is affectionately known as the “Fontana Hilton “. This is because it is a huge building on a aloe that sleeps 20, and right next-door is a bathroom running water and a shower. I was super excited for both! It is also a notable spot as being right before the Smoky Mountains.When I rolled up, it wasn’t the typical shelter scene. Not sure how to describe it, but basically the words “grody party” came to mind. There were people that I think had been staying for days, and not because of injury. There was a guy leaving that said, “I've been here for days, starting to get sick of it” and walked out with his dog and a cardboard box with a flower vase in it. Which may not seem that weird in real life, but on the trail… I was debating finding an uneven or super stealth campsite, but since there was room at the shelter I just stayed there. Luckily some of the shadier people left or went to bed. A bunch of snorers, but I had my earplugs and slept beautifully!","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590540,"Everyone was up around 6am. Apparently the snorers kept a lot of people up and no one slept except me! Since I had showered yesterday and didn’t have to break down a tent, I utilized the running water and got an early start with Peaches and Grits. We all walked across the Dam together (which I believe is the tallest in the US after the Hoover Dam), entered the smokies, and put our permits in before Peaches and I got ahead of Grits. Peaches is originally from Kentucky but lives in Tacoma now so we talked about The Pacific Northwest. Grits is from Florida, probably at least in his 60s and looks like Willie Nelson. The Smokies are a but unique since they are trying to manage all the people coming through especially with bears. Thru hikers have to apply for a permit which is good for 30 days from purchase and you basically have 8 days from entering the park to get through, only staying at shelters. I believe section hikers actually have to reserve space in a specific shelter for the night. So if a shelter is full of sectioners, the thru hiker has to tent next to the shelter. Basically a lot of rules and tourists and I just wanted to get through. The morning was pretty uphill, but between talking with peaches and good views it went pretty quickly. We got to Mollies Ridge shelter which was about 12 miles in, but it was crowded and early so just had a snack and pressed on. The trail was lovely- compacted dirt and following along ridges rather than up and down over peaks. I think it helps too that there were no roads, which would mean going down to and up from a gap. We were above the leaves so had good views too. When we got to the next shelter it was still early, but didn’t really press on so stayed there. I will say that the shelters in the Smokies were amazing- stone, fit at least 12 people, tarp in front, bear cables... Rob, Connor, Philly crew and a few other thru hikers came but no sectioners so there was plenty room in the shelter. As it was starting to get dark around 8, a thru hiker comes running in out of breath. I guess she had just seen a bear, made a lot of noise and it did not run away. That’s the Smokies for you, the bears are aggressive. This does not mean they would attack a human, but they are not skittish/frightened by us and will stop at nothing to get food. That is why they require acres to stay at our camp near shelters. Sweet dreams!","Fontana Hilton

Definitely got steeper uphill and I was struggling to lunch at the Derrick Knob Shelter where I saw everyone again. Took a long lunch and drank a bunch of water so felt more refreshed. Basically the Smokies is a couple days up to Clingmans Dome and a couple days down so I was i the harder part. About a mile after lunch I walked past a wild turkey just kind of chilling on the trail. Passed the Silers Bald Shelter, but Double Spring seemed to have more water and privy so decided to continue on. Walked the last mile with the Philly crew, they are super cool. Professor is an art teacher for kids with disabilities and is raising money for his school. Recruited two of his rock climbing friends, Fedex and Four Step, to join him. They started after me but have been putting in some big days. I like their pace though and hope to stay around them.
 The last mile was through a pine forest, which was a nice change of scenery. When we got to the shelter, there were a bunch of thru hikers there including Rob, Aing, and Peaches. It was still early, but the next shelter was over 5 miles away and I wasn’t looking to put in a 20 miles. Plus the privy was SUPER nice. It was decent weather out so was thinking about tenting, but I was lazy and didn’t want to be the only one camping. Other people did come later to tent, but by that time I was already set up in the shelter.

It started to switch between drizzling and pouring so we kept taking on and off our rain gear. It cleared up a bit when we got to Clingmans Dome, which is the tallest point along the AT. There is a cool walkway above the top to get a good view, but it was cold and windy so we didn’t stay long. Not many tourists even though can drive right to it. Although I think we were lucky because when the Philly crew was there, they got hailed on! A few easy miles later we reached Newfound Gap. Not only was this the first road crossing we had seen for days, but it is a huge parking lot and destination for tourists. For through hikers it is great because there are flushing toilets, trash cans, and easy hitching to Gatlinburg. When we got there, it was like a big reunion with a bunch of through hikers we hadn’t seen for a while. Peaches was getting picked up by a friend, who had brought a carton of supermarket turkey sandwiches. Even though it was dry hamburger bun, meat, and cheese, tasted delicious! Was sad to see Paches go though, she is taking a few zeros to go to a wedding and hopefully she will catch back up. Rob and I continued on the few miles to the shelter in a mix of rain and sun. When we got there, it was packed with section hikers but luckily we were early enough to get a spot with the bad weather. There was a cool group of five or older guys from St. Louis and a trio of college girls from Michigan. We all ended up playing euchre even past the dark!The Philly crew had gotten a ride from Peaches’ friend to grab a burger so got in late and had to tent in the rain. Luckily I had brought enough food to make it through the Smokies so didn’t have to go to Gatlinburg.

It was one of the most beautiful spots I had seen in the Smokies if not the whole trail (apart from the Standing Indian sunset). Much better than Clingmans Dome, I think because you are on rocks feeling more in it than above. There were a few day hikers there, and when they found out we were thru they had a bunch of questions for us. Same as the college girls had the previous night. Felt kind of like a celebrity they looked at us with amazement. I remember being on the other side asking the questions, but I feel we have only been out a few weeks and aren’t hardcore yet! The main Appalachian Trail is ‘white blazed’, meaning there are small white paint marks on trees indicating where to go. Side trails are ‘blue blazed’, so those marks are blue. It could be a path to water, landmark, etc. we did about three short ones that led to overlooks. I stopped for a beautiful lunch on the rocks at Bradley’s View. Even though it was a short pretty easy day, the last few miles hard and I was happy to get to the shelter. There were lots of spots open inside so I set up in there. It was the usual crew of me, Rob, Philly crew, etc. A couple of Germans as well, which is probably the second most common foreign country of origin after Australia. A ridge runner showed up, which was interesting. Ridge Runners are seasonal paid through Appalachian Trail Conservancy to monitor sections, report issues, etc. But in the Smokies they also check permits. Not sure how that works since I don’t think they have legal authority and the permits are through the park, but oh well I didn’t ask. She was actually really cool about and told us the reason one of the shelters ahead was closed. A few weeks ago, there was a group camping/hammocking away from the shelter. She told them to go closer, but they didn’t. One of the hammockers woke up with a bear under him! He made a bunch of noise and the bear slashed the hammock. Luckily no one was hurt, but still scary and unfortunate.There was also a guy Ball Flap (has to do will ball of his foot) that was hiking in sandals and had already done PCT as well. They both agreed that the AT is actually harder in terms of steep ups and downs, which was interesting.The Philly crew introduced Teledraw, which I haven’t played in years!

Also, I haven’t close the nozzle of my sleeping pad all the way so woke up a few times on the hard floor. They all got out at six but I was little slower so more like 6:30. But of course I had to catch up to them so booked it for the first few miles. We all ended up doing 10 miles before 10 AM, which was a fun accomplishment. Granted, the terrain was easy and it was a beautiful sunrise.Rob split off to do the Mt Cammerer trail, but I wasn’t about to add another mile to an already long day. So the Philly crew and I went on. Oh. I forgot Rob now has a trail name - ‘Double O’.

The first spring I passed, I spent a while getting water and letting my feet soak it was delicious. The trail then crossed some roads and the interstate, which was actually a bit complicated to follow. I forgot my guide had a map. Not used to blazes on guardrails!It was basically a climb up the road to Standing Bear Farm. I wasn't sure if I was going to stay there, but at least needed a resupply. As I was walking in, I heard someone say, ""Oh great, another F*ing thru hiker"". So great reception. One of the workers showed me the store, which was based on honor system where you wrote down what you bought and gave them the total. Almost all of the food was expired, and seemed to be a random assortment grabbed from the dumpster of a grocery store. Overall, the place was not ""cute"" or ""quirky"", but gross. Double O got there when I did and was like yeah, no. I even wanted to filter the water I got from the tap! Reminded me a lot of the scene from Fontana - thru hikers that start taking some zeros, get drunk and never leave. I guess they were ""work for stay"" without the work part. Luckily I only needed food for a couple days so made do and got out as quickly as possible.Unfortunately the next listed campsite, a few miles up, wasn't really great. We ended up walking all the way up the next mountain. On the way we passed an old man that mentioned something about a bear. When we got to a clearing, we met a thru hiker named Peach who was sitting. Apparently she had just seen a mama bear with a cub not 20 feet away. She made noise, blew whistle, etc. but the bear just stared. Eventually Peach just kind of walked slowly around it and it looked at her but never moved. She was pretty shaken up though. She said her friend was at the top checking campsites and she would be ok. We pressed on and at the top there was an FAA communications tower. Beautiful spot, but not really anywhere to camp. We put our packs down and walked 0.1 miles where we saw Peach's hiking partner (Wild Man) at a nice spot. It wasn't huge, but we would make it work and had a beautiful sunset/rise. The rest of their crew, Nacho and Golden Girl joined an hour later, as did the German from the shelter before (I think his name is Stefon, but I called him Ninja Turtle because everything he owned was green, slow and steady pace, and kind of snuck up on you).

The first part was easy downhill and went quicker than I thought. Still trying to gauge my pace, especially since I didn’t have the updated Guthook for GPS until town. The rest of the morning was a little tougher, but found humor in a sign warning of pooping with a snake present. Not a mile later, Double O (Who for a good reason was in front) stopped me because he heard a large rattle. A couple feet ahead, chilling on a log was a rattlesnake that must have been as wide as my arm! I tried to take a picture, but couldn’t get a good angle. We put some signs up/laid out sticks and went about ten feet off the trail to go around. Luckily he didn’t move. Ninja Turtle caught up at this point so we were glad to warn him.
A few miles further was a parking lot for Max Patch, a popular destination. There was a woman getting out of her car with two dogs we started playing with. Turns out her name is Mama Goose because she was an Army Medic who hiked the AT and PCT and is currently a physical therapist looking to complete the CDT and thus the triple crown. She was dropping off Pathfinder, a 76 year old woman who fell and hit her head near the NOC. Sounds like they basically called Mama Goose who had been nursing her back. So cool! She gave us fresh water and crackerjacks too. 
Eventually we made the descent to Max Patch, which originally was called Mack’s Patch for a guy that introduced cattle grazing there. So it was basically a big mowed area lots of people picnic, play frisbee, etc. with 360 degree views. Basically all sorts of ‘frolicking’.
We found a good spot and ate lunch, called our moms for Mother’s Day, and took naps. After about an hour when we were just putting on our packs, Banana Boy showed up. We were talking for a bit, and then came the Philly crew, nacho and wild man and basically our whole group. We must have looked so funny with all of the clean showered families having a picnic and our ratty looking group! After another couple hours we figured we had to leave so all caravanned our together except Wild Man who was camping up there. It must have been an amazing spot for sunset and stargazing, but would have made our day too short.
The rest wasn’t too steep, but after all that frolicking was a bit rough. When we got to the shelter, it didn’t look super inviting so backtracked to a hill we had just passed. There were two loud women (I think mother/daughter) with ugly dogs who were already camping there but it was really the best option. Not to sound mean, but they were larger and only averaging a mile an hour at best so not sure they are going to make it. Bless their hearts.
A bunch of people complained about how far the water was, but when I went down it was less than 0.2 miles! Guess it’s all relative after a long day. It was pretty buggy, so we all got in our tents without the rain fly on to watch an amazing sunset. The mother/daughter talked about getting up at 5 so I was like oh, great.

By 7am I was out with Gypsy, Double O, and the Philly crew. We really only had to cross over Bluff Mountain and then it was all downhill to Hot Springs. We made pretty good time, but lost Nikki and she said she would just find us in town. There were some views, mostly we were in the shade and a quick walk. Even with light packs (no food weight), the last 5 miles seemed to take forever.
Finally we heard traffic and hit the road. There was a hostel right there and a few guys in a truck offered a ride to a store down the road. The Philly crew jumped in, but Double O and I didn’t want to miss any blazes so continued on the trail. I saw a sign for a trail magic with an arrow, thought it was outdated but walked a few dozen feet and people from a porch called at me. Not exactly sure their story, but it seemed like a group of former through hikers that had rented a house. They had barbecue sandwiches, fruit salad, water and beer. It was after lunchtime and I was hungry so I partook even though we had just gotten to town. Would have been great if they were more in the woods!
We continued on the trail, which at this point followed the main street. We get to my hostel, Sunnybank Inn, but Double O had to go meet friends who were picking him up.
Sunnybank Inn is a trail institution. It is kind of a combination hostel/bed and breakfast owned by a man named Elmer. He thru hiked back in the seventies, and liked Hot Springs so much he moved back and running the place since then. The building itself is historic, probably from the 1800s and still in pretty good shape. There are lots of porches, reading rooms with shelves of books, and even a music room with guitars and piano for playing. The only issue is there is one shower for everyone, which includes about 8 guests, Elmer, and two work for stays (Matt and Sierra). But for the $25/night hiker special is a steal!
Since the shower was free took the opportunity cleaned off a week of dirt and sweat. They had waffles left over from breakfast, so chomped on one and hit the town.
I wasn’t sure what was around and the AWOL guide wasn’t specific, so I went to the visitor center. I asked for a map, and the guy laughed and pointed “gas station there, restaurant there, bar there. Ok, there’s your map!” Didn’t realize how small it was. 
I stopped by the outfitter that also had a bunch of natural/healthy foods which was nice. Got a smoothie and bottle of wine at a cafe and used the WiFi at the library (apparently no one gets service in town). There I saw Big Money who mentioned they trying to get to Trail Days. Trail Days is a big festival in Damascus (southern VA) that is like a big party of current and former thru hikers. Well some of the gear booths might interest me, I have no desire to camp in the field with 3000 other people. And getting there is a bit difficult as we are still a couple weeks away I’m heading out on the trail so would have to hitch. But to each their own!
I realized I hadn’t eaten lunch yet, so went to the Hillbilly Market (yes that is actually the name) and got way to much food. And it was already 3pm.Also, I forgot that I had picked up a few Ramen’s and tuna from the hiker box at the inn so of course got way too much resupply.
I had signed up for dinner that night, so at 7pm I went to the dining table. It was Elmer, Sierra, Matt, and four of us guests. Every meal, you go around and say your name, a bit about yourself, and an answer to the question. Today’s question was “if you were a spice, which would you be?” I learned Sierra is currently a student at Duke, and Elmer used to teach there.
The dinners are 4 course vegetarian, and was delicious- soup, salad, curry tofu, tea, and apple cake with ice cream. I am not a huge dessert person, but ate it all!Yes, this is after eating a huge lunch at three. Needless to say I had stomachache but it was worth it:)!

The morning was a little uphill, but the weather was actually only partly cloudy. There was a blue blaze to a lookout tower that I was considering in honor of Double O, but fog was starting to roll in and wanted to beat potential rain.
The rest of the morning was pretty level and I didn’t see a single hiker. However, there was a cool ridge walk along Big Firescald Knob that was almost a rock scramble in some places. It can be amazing 360 degree views, but was too foggy for me towards the west. It was difficult with wet rocks(fell twice) but nice to mix it up. And something I have never seen before... a “bad weather bypass” option! Wish that happened more often!
Lunched at the Jerry Cabin shelter which apparently had a cat, but I didn’t see it. Cam was just leaving but Seamus stayed a bit and hung out. A new hiker, Spiderman, came through as I was leaving. He stayed two shelters back and was pulling for a 20 but trying to beat the rain.
About an hour after I headed out, just as I was walking over the exposed bald of Big Butt Mountain (yes that is really the name) it started to drizzle. Was trying to hold of putting on rain gear but then it picked up. Saw Seamus and we both put on our rain gear. Not but ten minutes later it stopped so we took it off. Then about half hour after that started sprinkling again. I was thinking to myself “I’m not going to keep putting on and taking off, I will do my rain skirt but not my jacket!” It stayed a consistent drizzle then picked up. I was still thinking “oh well my shirt will get a little wet but hopefully I’ll be under tree cover soon!” But just as I gave in and put on my jacket, the skies opened up. Rain seemed to be coming in all directions and no sign of stopping. Those last few miles luckily were easy terrain so just pushed on to the shelter. When I got there, a lot of people were standing around so I was like “oh crap it’s full!” But it was a big group of section hikers just waiting out the rain. I quickly laid out my stuff inside just in case. Then about half hour later, the skies cleared and the sun came out! I was debating continuing on, but didn’t feel like packing all my stuff up and figured I could at least get an early start tomorrow. And since it was only 4, I would have a lot of time to take care of things. Spiderman showed up, turns out he had stayed at a shelter last night with Double O and the Philly Crew! Apparently Professor was having some knee issues so they were taking it slow. So basically I am just one shelter ahead of them each time! Funny how can pass news that way too since there is no service.
Overall in the shelter it was me, Spiderman, old guy from last night, stefon/ninja turtle, and another old section hiker I think named rick. All in bed by 8:30!
Around 9 I heard the rain start to pick up so I rushed out for a final bathroom trip. I guess I kind of through everything down in my haste so Rick was like “everything ok? That was some gymnastics!”","Little Laurel Shelter

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591578,"I woke up at 6 and was the first one up. After Spiderman I was the next one out around 7:45. The beginning was pretty flat and I made good time. Then it got steep up, but along a waterfall so was a pretty. I passed Cam and Seamus who had tented near the top.
After playing the rain gear on/off game, finally the sun came out! Stopped for lunch at the Hogback Ridge Shelter, where water was like a half mile away. Luckily, Sharice was already filling his so added mine!
Rick stopped by and we hiked out together. He is super cool section hiker, has done the whole trail in sections and right now doing Smokies to Damascus 300 miles. Former Army at Fort Bragg and lives in western NC. Looking at him and watching him, you’d never think it but he’s been pushing 18-20 mile days. He always says “can’t keep up with you young guns” but always does!
There was a a big climb to Big Bald at the end that had amazing 360 views. Clouds were looking dark, but luckily held. At the top there was a group that drove to a close parking lot, and they grew up I Mount Pleasant!
Even though it was a bigger shelter, pretty full with a big group of thru hikers that only did ten since the last shelter. Even though only the top was available and there was no ladder, the weather was still looking iffy and I want to get an early start tomorrow so decided to stay in the shelter again. It’s funny, I rushed out of the Smokies to avoid having to stay in shelters but am doing it anyway!","Flint Mountain Shelter

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591579,"It was rainy and windy all night so I was glad I was in the shelter. I was one of the first up and probably woke a bunch of others up starting to clean up my space since I didn’t want to jump down yet.
Unfortunately my jacket fell down from the wind and got wet and muddy. Luckily, Luna had an extra jacket for some reason and let me borrow it since we were both going to the same destination.
Since I didn’t want to to get to town that late, I tried to get ready quickly and was the first out at 7:15. Of course Spiderman passed me momentarily as he averages like 3 miles an hour. The cold windy fog gave an eerie feeling, and luckily was downhill so I pushed it quickly, passing a few tenters.
I just had trail mix to keep me going, but “lunched “ at No Business Knob Shelter. There are different trail clubs that manage sections of the AT, and you can tell the difference.  Shelters here don’t have privies or bear cables. But the trail overall is still nice with only short sections of steep ascent or descent.
Leaving the shelter, it started to sprinkle but I did not want to mess with rain gear. Luckily the weather held and I won for today:).
The last few miles were pretty much downhill switchbacks into town. Very similar to Hot Springs, when you get close you see buildings and heat motors but are still so far away.
Right off the trail on the Nolichucky River is a hostel called Uncle Johnny’s a lot of people stay at. It has been around for a while and another trail institution. I was worried it was going to be another Standing Bear, but luckily was nice. Spiderman and I shared a double private room which was only slightly more expensive than the bunkhouse. I showered and washed my socks in there as well; with them keep getting wet it is giving my feet issues so hopefully we have some dry days.
The hostel had a daily shuttle to a shopping center that left in the late afternoon. It dropped you off at a strip mall with a Mexican restaurant, liquor store, and Italian restaurant. Apparently the Italian was BYOB and could bring in anything from the liquor store. I wasn’t feeling pasta (or alcohol) so went with Rick and Erich from Switzerland to the Mexican for delicious fajitas.
There was a Walmart across the street and the shuttle was picking us there. I haven’t been to a Walmart in years so of course got overwhelmed. At least they had produce!
When I got back to the hostel, Double O and the Philly crew were there! They had pulled a 27 mile day... wow... not me!","Bald Mountain Shelter

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591584,"I woke up around 6 still and had a delicious breakfast with fresh fruit. Everyone was taking it slowly and enjoying much needed sun. I got out around 9, just after Spiderman who was booking it even more than usual to get to Damascus in six days.
When I left the room, I noticed Spiderman had left his thru hiker tag. This is a little orange piece of plastic that has your number and some other info. The color changes every year and some people wear it on the outside of their packs. I brought it to the manager who shrugged and was like “I guess we can put it in our list and found...” I replied that we filled out cards with our contact info and he shrugged again and said “no one really fills those out anyway” even though I was there the day before when we did it. So long story short, he was not interested in helping. So I took the tag and will somehow get it to Spiderman... not sure how because I don’t have any contact for him and he’s so much faster than me.
Anyway, I left and it was a beautiful morning uphill on the trail. I passed an older section hiker named “trail dad” and another guy while snacking at a shelter.
I lunched at Indian Grave Gap which has a large parking lot and right off a major road. Since it’s the weekend, I was kind of hoping for trail magic. A few people passed me but just waved (maybe the smell kept them away). Trail dad showed up and we were talking about being low on water but would continue on when a van showed up and two older guys got out. Turns out it was someone dropping off from Trail Days. He asked if we wanted beer, but when we replied with water he had that. The trail will indeed provide!
I spent a while retaping my feet... they got pretty tender from the friction from wet socks so hopefully a day of dry weather will help.
All afternoon I was thinking about logistics in my head. Normally there is not much to worry about- look at how many miles until the next town/resupply, figure out how many days that will be and what food is needed. But I have to switch out to my summer gear (lighter clothes and sleeping bag) and most people do that in Damascus. The trail goes through town right by the post office so super easy. But the schedule I was headed on had me getting there on Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning of a holiday weekend, and I wouldn’t be able to pick up/send out until Tuesday. Plus, other places may be closed and hostels full (Damascus is right by the Virginia Creeper Trail which is popular with cyclists). So I could either book it doing 22 mile days, go super slow doing 14s, try to have it sent to a drop and pay someone to mail out, or utilize a different town. Easy, right?! As I have mentioned I am a big picture thinker (i.e. I want to hike a lot) and struggle with the details.
As I was trying to work all of this out of my head, I got to a beautiful view aptly named Beauty Spot. Someone had left styrofoam coolers with trail magic, but when I opened they were only filled with trash. There was a parking lot close by, so I asked a couple if they didn’t mind carrying it out. We started talking and probably could have gotten some magic from them but I turn around and Rick was there! He looks so unassuming when he walks, but must have really booked it to catch up.
We continued on to what we thought might be q possible camping spot. Trail dad caught up and there was a lot of confusion with the different guides and maps of where we trying to get. Since it was only 2:30, I was like either way I’m going on!
We got to what was probably the correct site a couple miles later. All of the spots were sloped and at the bottom of the valley, so went back to the road. Even though it was only gravel, I don’t love camping near roads. Both the noise and  shady locals usually turn me off. The next official site wasn’t for another couple uphill miles and  shelter after that. But the skies were threatening and time passing so we ultimately decided to set up camp even though just a twelve mile day. This would give our feet good chance to air out and would still keep us on schedule (he had mail drops planned). Trail Dad and another guy, Still Eric, joined us later so we figured we had power in numbers.
After all that, it turned out to be a beautiful evening but oh well what can you do and was nice to get done with everything early. Although we hadn’t seen any fellow hikers go by and assumed they all camped atop Beauty Spot!","Uncle Johnny’s, Erwin

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591587,"I woke up at 530 to go to the bathroom of course but still didn’t get out until almost 9. I was alone for most of the morning with some steep hills, but I took it slow. At the campsite after ours, there was a creepy Christmas tree in a pretty spruce forest. The weather was nice and cool with some spots of sun. 
Lunched at the shelter with a few people, but spent most of the afternoon alone. It was supposed to storm around noon and I heard thunder ahead, but only got a few sprinkles. Still Eric and Braino, an Australian, joined me for the last few miles.
We were about 20 minutes from the shelter and I was thinking how nice my feet didn’t get wet when it started to pour. Which sucked, but luckily we could recover in the shelter. It was only about 3, but I was not feeling tenting so just stayed. A bunch more people came that had been at trail days but most tented so the shelter wasn’t that full. The sun actually came out for a bit and I was considering tenting as well, but my stuff was already laid out.","Beauty Spot Gap

I believe I woke up early to cloudy skies, but was one of the last ones out. The trail gradually ascended, I caught up with Rick and Medicine Man pretty quickly. I didn't camel up on water before I left, so needed it by the time I got to Ash Gap. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst water sources so far - steep and far away, and was only a trickle. They must have waited half an hour for me!
It was probably a good break, because next was Roan Mountain. The summit was about 1,000 feet up over a mile. But we just took the switchbacks slow and steady and had some good conversation. Medicine Man is actually a dentist who attempted a thru hike a few years ago. He made it as far as New Jersey but took about a week off at home and psychologically couldn't come back. The dangers of taking too much time off!
At the summit was the ruins of a former hotel and a bit of a view. There was also a parking lot with trash cans and restrooms. Unfortunately everything was locked, opening in a week after Memorial Day. So we had to cathole it which was hard because it was so open, and basically had to tell all of the hikers coming by that they were closed - the bearers of bad news.

After passing the Roan Knob Shelter, which is actually the highest on the AT, it gradually descended to Carver's Gap, although the trail was super rocky and annoying. There was a parking lot and lots of people at the gap, so I went up to some people and they agreed to take my trash. Amazing how much I accumulated in just a couple days!
We found a nice rock with a view to have lunch. I walked most of the rest of the day with Braino. He actually started a few weeks before me, but had some foot issues. Hopefully now he has the right shoe. He is an interesting guy - construction worker and dune buggy competitor from Perth who also was vegan for a while.The last few miles to the shelter seemed to drag on, but we finally made it to the turnoff. The Overmountain Shelter is unique on the AT as it is actually an old barn that overlooks a valley. The view is great, plus there is room for at least 20 people. The privy is not covered, but is a throne that is ""bedazzled"" with sequins. I've been here before and knew how awesome it was, so made sure to time accordingly.Not but 10 minutes after arriving, it started to thunderstorm. Braino still wanted to tent, but considering the nice dry view I was staying put. Last time it rained too, and you can see the clouds roll through the valley. It filled up pretty quickly, but there was room for everyone. Including some younger (maybe right out of high school) hikers from trail days like Sir Bags and Joan of Arc.Also, I started on April 22nd so happy ""Monthiversary"" to me!","Clyde Smith Shelter

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592156,"Woke up around 6 to rain. There was a bit of a view of the sunrise from the shelter before the fog rolled in. Most people were taking there time getting up, but I was actually out by 7:30. I had been thinking about making hot oatmeal, but it wasn’t that cold so I did the usual cold soak.Little Hump and Big Hump mountains can have great views as they are exposed balds. Unfortunately, it was foggy and rainy so I could barely see ten feet in front of me. Glad we got the views yesterday. Braino passed me and I thought was way ahead, but when I got a clear look he was only feet away. I fell about four times on the mud or wet rocks, but usually backwards on my pack and nothing too serious.Finally once we got below the tree line the clouds parted and the sun came out! Of course once there were no views. Rick caught up and we hiked easily down to Hwy 19 east together. There is a hostel about a quarter mile down called Mountain Harbor that has a resupply, etc.Right at the road we saw Braino getting in a truck that said free shuttle, but we wanted to walk the quarter mile to the hostel. On the way a car stopped and asked us if we wanted a ride. The driver was the owner of another 2 properties... one a quiet hostel/b&b and the other more of a dirty party place. The quiet one was only 30 bucks for a private room and included laundry, but I wanted to see what was going on at the close one so took a card.We got to Mountain Harbor around noon, and were the first new arrivals there’s except for Braino. He said he had a weird experience where the driver of the shuttle amd the hostel owner got into a big shouting argument. Sounds like there is some bad blood/rivalry between the hostels.Since it was early yet, I wpasn’t sure if I wanted to stay and do a half day or go on. My feet weren’t bad and the weather was good, but still wanted to air things out and not in a hurry. I got a few snacks and learned they didn’t have any bunk rooms open, only tenting for $10 or fancy b&b for $150. I haven’t been a big fan of camping at hostels since you can just go back to the trail and do it for free, but then they brought homemade pie and pastries and I ate so much. Think I’m starting to get the hiker hunger!So I arranged for a tent spot, which are nice right on a creek but a bit of a walk from the barn. I quickly set up my tent, showered and started my laundry before anyone else came. They had two nice showers and the bunk rooms were really nice, almost wish I made a reservation!More and more people started coming in, including a bunch from the shelter last night like Medicine Man, Trail Dad (Jode), etc. The special was Rueben so had one of those and a really fun group showed up that have all been hiking together. We all put our feet in the creek and enjoyed the sun, which was nice. Around 5 we shuttled to the convenience store for beers and sat by the creek drinking them. I got a salad for dinner and finally got full! Overall it was a very relaxing day and even though it’s been over a week straight of days that have rained, the afternoon was lovely.","Overmountain Shelter

Even though it wasn’t served until 8, there still a bunch of us ready including Braino, Finger Lickin, and Andre/Buddy the Elf who is actually from Israel.
They brought out juice, coffee, and warm homemade chocolate chip muffins while we waited so I got my OJ fix (and some actual nutrients!). When we lined up at the food truck where they had so much: eggs, croissants, meats, potatoes, biscuits... all fresh and homemade. Usually I’m not a big fan of those kind of breakfast foods but I probably ate 2 pounds and would have stayed longer but need to put in some miles today.
Braino and I finally got on the road around 9. It was a beautiful day, and after some uphill we got beautiful views from a meadow. A little later on was a side trail to Jones Falls, which was nice since we haven’t seen many waterfalls. And right after that was mile 400!
We leapfrogged a group called the Wolfpack we met at the hostel that have been hiking together for a few weeks... Cracks, MF Mouse, Finger Lickin, and a couple others. The old guy, AZ, thru hiked a few years ago so is basically leading them since he remembers many of these places. They are really fun and in their 30s, but keep a fast pace so not sure I can keep up with them but cool they have a trail family. I’ve gone through some hiking partners (Dozer, Double O) and possible families (group I started with, Philly crew).
We all hung around the Elk River, many went in but a little cold for me. There were a few kayakers that paddled by which looked awesome. The trail followed along the river and there were many streams which was nice so water wasn’t a problem.
Braino went ahead, but we had lunch at the Mountaineer Shelter just after another falls. We hiked together all afternoon and hopefully I can keep around him. Super nice, chill guy. He goes faster than me, especially uphill, but I think I have longer endurance since he has some foot issues.
I actually ran into Professor and Four Step who said them plus Fedex and Double O are putting in 25-30 mile days so yeah... I did give them Spider-Man’s hiker tag, hopefully they will see him in Damascus.
We were hoping to stop at a group campsite along a stream with the Wolfpack, but when we got there it was crowded with a couple thru hikers and a group of southbound sectioners. So we pushed on to the shelter along with Finger Lickin. The last mountain was tough, and when we got to the shelter it was empty. Braino and I started setting up our tents and Finger Lickin decided to stay in the shelter. A few more people came including Nikki. Unfortunately she has to go back to Australia, but hopes return next year to finish.
A few minutes later, Conor showed up! Turns out he stayed a whole another day at Elmer’s in Hot Springs and has been doing some big days. He went on but I’m sure our paths will cross again. Not sure where the rest of my first group is, but I assume I’m in front.
The shelter filled up as did the tent sites. It took me like an hour to hang my bear line and missed a nice campfire. But apparently this section has one of the highest concentrations of bears on the trail, and Braino and Juice saw a cub earlier today. But it ran away so hopefully they are not aggressive like the Smokies.
After dinner I was going to brush my teeth when I couldn’t find my toiletries bag. I thought I left it at the hostel but remembered I had the soap at lunch so maybe left it there. And I had gone over a week without losing anything! Luckily we go near a town tomorrow so I can re-supply there but still annoying.

We then followed along the Laurel Fork River which had some cool narrow rock formations. After some steep up and down rock steps, we got to Laurel Falls which is one of the biggest on the trail.After early lunch and foot soak, we continued on the trail which was basically cut into the side of a big rock. It was nice to mix it up. The trail then split.., the AT went up and there was a side trail to Franklin. Some people take the blue blaze a half mile into town and then hitch to a later spot on the trail to skip the mountain. Even though I needed to go to town, we continued up the mountain. Raccoon joined us, have seen him a few times before and he is a bit chatty but made the time go quickly.We soon learned why many people skip this part. It was one of the steepest and longest climbs in a while and had no rewarding view at the top. However, it was a great feeling finishing it and the downhill wasn’t too steep so easy on the knees.At the bottom of the hill was a road and a hostel right there. Considering I just stayed at Mountain Harbor and Erwin, wasn’t necessarily looking to spend the night. But I needed to go to town, and there weren’t really many campsites in the next few miles anyway. The next shelter was closed and apparently this is one of the highest areas of bear activity. I was hoping for a bunk room because it was supposed to rain and there bunkhouse is nice (each bed has private light, outlet, and curtain) but all were full. So Braino and I got tent sites and set up before the rain. Unfortunately the were on a hill and all dirt so will be messy if it does rain.The place overall was pretty cool, the showers were pipes that filled a bucket with holes above you. And they had kayaks to rent, Lake Watauga was only a few minutes away. Conor was sitting when I came in, he is hanging around the area because his girlfriend is driving down to meet him.The shuttle to town (Hampton, TN) left at 6. Unfortunately the grocery store was closed, so I went to Subway and got a sandwich with all the veggies! My plan was to get a foot long and save half for lunch, but ate it all right there. Picked up beer at the gas station and toiletries from the dollar store and the shuttle was ready to come back.We sat around drinking beers, it was Nikki’s last day before going back to Australia so it was sad. One of the workers started a huge bonfire, which was weird to us since we usually have small fires. Then they said apparently still have to hang bear bags even though we are near a road and there are lots of people and a fence. But they let us put them in the kitchen which was nice. I was up until almost 11 that is even later than before the trail! Braino came back from the fire and said apparently our tent site had been visited by bears the last couple nights. I think the owners ended up walking around with flashlights and dogs pretty late.","Moreland Gap Shelter

Which doesn’t sound much, but it’s felt like so long since I’ve had cereal with milk, one of my most common breakfasts in “normal life”.When we finished getting ready the weather was still bad but Braino and I left anyway. First ones out except for Sir Bags/Joan of Arc. It sounded like people were waiting around for the rain to let up (which could take hours) or maybe even zeroing. I am no fan of the rain, but if I never hiked in bad weather I wouldn’t get too far on the AT.The beginning of the trail was supposed to follow along Watauga Lake, but there was a reroute due to flooding. It sounds like some people tried the original trail anyway, but it was pretty bad and they had to bail.The trail then crossed the Watauga dam and followed a road.

Had a snack and were talking about going on, but the campsites were really good and we had already done sixteen miles so just set up camp.Mike came by a bit later, as did a sectioner. We all set up our tents really far apart, but no one else really came so probably should have done closer given the recent bear activity.

I basically ran everything to under the shelter, and once it cleared up could break down my tent.Braino and I got out around 8:15 and it was mostly let cloudy but dry and easy terrain. A couple miles in was the Nick Grindstaff memorial. Guess he was a hermit in the 1800s, it was tough to read the stone so will have to look it up. Sounds like an interesting guy.A few miles later we got to a really pretty section that involved going through meadows and cow pastures with open views. And the sun was out for a change! The path was gravel but apparently ADA accessible. Unfortunately Braino stepped right in a cow pie. City boy!Lunched a the Double Springs Shelter where there was a hiker, River, with his dog. River didn’t seem to be in a big hurry and was probably stoned. I’m sure a nice enough guy, but got some weird vibes from him.When we were almost at the Low Gap road crossing/parking lot, Braino goes “I think there is trail magic!” I didn’t believe him as we have been duped before (i.e. at an earlier parking lot a woman pulled up, adjusted a cooler in her trunk, but then drove off). But this was for real! It was a former thru-hiker named Whamo. I’d say he was mid-50s and had a sweet minivan loaded with sodas, water, fruit, and snacks. He even brought a trash can and soap!We sat there for a bit and started to leave when Mike showed up. When we started to leave again, a car pulled up to the AT on the other side of the road, the driver opened the trunk and sat down. I wasn’t sure what they were doing, so casually walked over to explore. Long story short, it was another thru hiker, Red, I hadn’t seen since Fontana! I guess he had some foot injuries and rented a car to drove to trailheads to do half days while recovering. He gave us some cliff bars which was nice. What a small world on the AT!By the time we left, it had been over an hour and the skies were threatening so we were rushing. The dark clouds were slow coming out, but were finally over us and it started to downpour. After a few minutes I see Braino running. Turns out there was an old lean-to/shelter that fit about 3 people. What great timing! As they say, the trail provides...We waited about 15 minutes for the cloud to pass, and just as it was starting to lighten up, Mike comes in. He was soaked, but it was good he came in because lightening and a huge crash of thunder sounded right above us.It was only a few more miles to the shelter where I was planning to stop and would have made 16 miles for the day and ten into Damascus tomorrow. Even though it was already 5 pm, with all the breaks it didn’t feel like we had done that much and our legs had more in them on this relatively flat terrain. But I was also liked the idea of not setting up and breaking down a tent. We went to fill up water (which was far) to ponder and Mike came and was setting up his stuff for the night. The weather was ok but a good chance of more rain/thunderstorms. We made the decision to press on, and at that time a couple showed up with their dog, along with River and his dog. It would have been super crowded so we made the right decision.Since it was getting late and we wanted to put in enough miles to justify not staying at the shelter, we seriously booked it and ended up doing 4.8 miles in an hour and a half to a campsite at a place noted as “ruins”. There weren’t any ruins here and there weren’t great tent spots, but we weren’t sure what was ahead so set up there.We were both so tired, we didn’t cook dinner and just had snacks.

It was less than 5 miles to Damascus and easy terrain. Since I go faster than Braino on the flat/downhills, I lead in front for a change. The downside of this position is the role of “spider web clearer”, especially when they are all at eye level. But it wasn’t too bad.
A few miles in we passed the sign marking the border into Virginia. So 3 states down, 11 more to go! Although Virginia will be long one - over 500 miles I think.
We did the 4.5 miles into town in an hour and a half, meaning 3 miles an hour. We were talking about how we’ve gotten trail legs now so can bust out miles, life on the trail is great, etc. and up comes a day hiker from Damascus with cute dogs. He gave us some good advice about town and was just a good guy, cementing our good vibes from earlier.
For better or worse, there were no good views getting into Damascus. Why I say that is sometimes it can be tough to see town, hear cars,etc. but still be far away with all the switchbacks.
At the edge of town there is a cool arch and a pretty park. It must have been the main plaza for Trail Days because we saw some left over structures.
Damascus is interesting because not only is it one of the most known Appalachian Trail towns, the Virginia Creeper bike trail goes right through as well. I think that is more the “bed and breakfast“ rather than hostel crowd, so the town kind of caters to both.
We of course wanted to get food, but stopped by Braino’s hostel first. He was staying at Crazy Larry’s, which had a party reputation in the past but is trying to clean up. I waited on the porch while Braino checked in, then he ushers me in and said Larry was going to cook us both breakfast. I thought that was really nice since I wasn’t even staying there. In the meantime, we talked with Rogue Cartographer (awesome trail name) who used to live in Australia so bonded with Braino.
Breakfast was delicious eggs, potatoes, and toast. Larry is definitely a character and has strong feelings on... well everything.
Wanting to give a little time before third breakfast/lunch, we walked to an outfitter. On the way, we ran into FedEx and Double O! They got in Saturday but taking a triple zero so didn’t really matter. They are staying at the Broken Fiddle hostel which I also had a reservation at but it looked like grungy/party scene so I canceled.
Looked at getting some permethrin for ticks at the outfitters but holding off for now. Also I will probably need to go again tomorrow once I figure out my summer gear exchange. It is nice there are 3 outfitters in town.
We walked over to the local diner and ran into Honey Bun and her boyfriend we had been around last few days. They passed us around 8pm the previous night and decided to go all the way into town. Finally made it around 10pm, and apparently talked to a local that picked them up and had an extra room! The trail provides!
Of course it started raining at this point, so it was nice being under cover for once. We walked back to Crazy Larry’s and I picked up my pack to walk over to my hostel. Braino and I exchanged numbers and I hope to continue hiking with him in the future.
On the way to the hostel, I ran into River. He had stayed at the shelter we were thinking about, so I’m glad we had moved on.
I checked into Woodchuck, and I was in a three person room. And by ‘room’ I mean oversized landing people walked through to get upstairs they had shoved a few beds in. But the House was nice with a couple porches so no worries.
My roommates were older guys I’ve never seen before. But turns out a group I’ve been overlapping with (Sir Bags, Joan of Arc, Juice, Butters, And So It Goes) are all staying upstairs. And Monk/Raccoon got here yesterday and are taking a zero today tenting. And MF Mouse and Tracks from the Wolfpack are here - apparently they did 33 to get here Saturday night but are paying for it now. I’m glad I didn’t rush!
I showered and cleaned out some of my gear. Then there was a grocery store shuttle. Turns out the store was less than a half mile away. I bought a lot of produce for dinner and decided to walk back since the rain had stopped and I never walk anywhere. Of course I ate so much produce I got a stomachache!
There was a computer at the hostel so I tried to upload photos on it (so much easier than a desktop) but it wasn’t really working. So I have to go to the library tomorrow, which doesn’t open until 11.","""Ruins"" Campsite

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592653,"Since I had eaten so much so late last night I had stomach issues in trouble falling asleep. Also woke up numerous times, so did not get a good nights sleep. Finally got up around 6:30 where Chuck and Critter were making breakfast. It was delicious blueberry waffles, fruit, eggs, and cereal. I had seconds of everything, plus some more fruit I picked up at the store!
Cleaned up and took care of a bunch of errands in the morning- post office twice, dollar store, outfitter, and library. I was able to switch out some of my heavier winter gear, so my bag should be lighter and smaller. And the library actually had working computers which made uploading photos a breeze!
I met Braino for lunch at a cafe, and Juice stopped by and joined us.
It had been dry and partly sunny all morning, but as soon as we were ready to head out it started raining of course. Braino bought too much food so his pack was really heavy, and we were kind of slow getting out. We even talked about zeroing, but had rushed to get everything done and didn’t want to be lame. Walking out of town we passed an ice cream place that sold Damascus Brewery beer. It was sooo tempting but we resisted. Later Braino said that if I hadn’t been there, he probably would have stopped and end up zeroing.
After a bit, the trail split; the AT went up the mountain and the Virginia Creeper Trail stayed straight. I am no purist (need to do every white blaze) and we had heard the Creeper was much prettier so we stayed on it. Peer pressure. Since it a bike trail, it was flat and smooth and followed along a river. It was like a dream not having to navigate over wet rocks and through six inches of mud. 
Even though we didn’t start until one, did about ten miles in a few hours. There was a little sign for a cafe, so we stopped to check it out. Was a real hidden gem dive diner; their special was chocolate cake so I had to try it! We talked about how fun it would have been to zero and ride bikes on the Creeper Trail but oh well.
The weather was only sprinkling, but was threatening more so we decided to look for spot for the night. There were dozens of campsites right along the river, but we read about one under a bridge that had a privy. I was skeptical, as most of the bridges we passed were only minimally off the ground. But we got to this huge memorial bridge that low and behold had lots of campsites. But the rain was starting to pick up, so we found less than flat sites that were protected right under the bridge! Unfortunately it was the other side of the river from the privy, but we set up anyway and were able to use the trestles as benches. The rain really picked up as we were finishing dinner, so rushed to our tents.","Woodchuck Hostel, Damascus

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592654,"Woke up a few times but was able to get back to sleep so finally got up around 6. Luckily it wasn’t raining, and I was able to make a privy run to the other side of the bridge before we left at 8. We passed a few tents and realized one was Double O, so they camped pretty close to us.
The morning was mostly uphill and foggy. It was so dark in some places, I was even thinking about turning on my headlamp. Buzzard Rock was exposed and supposed to have views, but it was so windy and foggy i had to dig my poles in the ground just to not get blown away! At least it wasn’t raining.
We stopped for a snack briefly after that in a gravel parking lot next to a road crossing. There was a car and a creepy van that looked deserted. The owner of the car walked by and we talked a bit about the van. When he left a guy came out of the van all offended we were calling it creepy. It almost looked like he was coming toward us to start something but went back inside. Whatever.
A little bit later we came to a large road crossing with a privy and trash can. Even though foggy and cloudy, we had some slight views. There was a guy with his dog there, Flavortown, who apparently started hiking at 3:30am!
A bit later Double O, Philly Crew, and Big Money showed up to eat as well. Just as Braino and I were starting to leave, minivan of old people drove up and asked me for a map. I directed them to the kiosk but thought “hmm, they are the ones who have a car, etc!”! Another car pulled up right after them so I thought part of the same group. But it turns out they brought trail magic! Long story short it was a couple from Texas who had just visited their son who is thru hiking and had leftover sodas, chips, granola bars, etc. It was awesome!
The rest of the afternoon was cloudy and foggy, which was unfortunate because it is a bunch of balds that have some of the best views on the trail. We debated only putting in 14 miles to a shelter and hope clearer in the morning but pressed on. There was a lot of horse and cow poop on the trail as the area is known for wild ponies.
Finally we made it to one of the highlights of the day... mile 500! And it was right at an area that had friendly ponies that licked your hands! Not half a mile after that was “Fatman Squeeze”, a narrow rock formation the trail goes through. So much awesomeness at once, too bad we didn’t have the views! But at least it wasn’t raining.
Due to all the delays, we didn’t make it to the shelter until almost 7 and the water was far away. It was starting to sprinkle with dark clouds coming so I was rushing to set up my tent, but luckily it passed.
After we had set up tents and taken care of some chores, ponies came up! It was actually kind of annoying because we were trying to cook and they were getting in the way. Apparently they are also known for stealing trekking poles to lick the salt so will have to watch that.
Didn’t finish everything and get into my tent until almost 9, but that was perfect because that’s when the rain really picked up!","Hassinger Bridge

I’m not sure what it is the last couple weeks I keep waking up; maybe I am falling off my pad? Luckily I am not too tired during the day and still able to put in decent mileage. Excited to sleep in a real bed next town!
We got out around  8 to partly sunny skies. The morning had some nice views along ridges; not as good as yesterday would have been, but somewhat made up for it. We were just a day early!
I found the spot past Scales on the Crest Trail that Ezra and I camped on, but the view wasn’t as great as I remembered.
Every time we stopped for a break, the Philly Crew/Double O would arrive then Big Money and Otis. I think they will all be ahead after tomorrow, but hopefully will catch up at some point.
We stopped at Hurricane Mountain Shelter for lunch and there was a nice creek there, so got to soak my feet AND dry out my rain fly. It was tough to leave, the afternoon was sunny but we were just in the forest the whole time. I will need to get used to the green tunnel ugh.
The last few miles were rough and the lack of sleep was hitting me, but finally made it to Trimpi Shelter. Tracks and Rogue Cartographer were already staying in the shelter. Since it seemed like the sun would be out all day, I set up downhill in an area without great drainage and even debated putting on the rain fly.
The Philly crew/Double O/Big Money/Otis showed up shortly later and we were all sitting around the picnic table cooking dinner when out of nowhere it got super dark. Not colder or windier and it was still dry, just really dark. I ran back to my tent and put everything inside just in case. A few minutes later it started raining, but then mellowed to just a sprinkle. Still, I think that marks over 16 days in a row that it rained at some point. Awesome.

I was actually ready by 7 AM, but was waiting for Braino until about 7:30. We were hustling to catch the shuttle to town, so we ended up doing 10 miles in about three hours!When we got to the visitor center, there were a bunch of people waiting for the shuttle. Good thing we rushed, because it was supposed to come at 11:15 but I guess in the summer comes at 10:45. Boy, did we all smell bad! But it was nice that the town has a bus that goes all the way out to the trail.Most hikers were just going to resupply and get lunch, but we were staying so got dropped off at the motel. While a budget motel, it honestly isn’t too bad.Once cleaned up, we took the bus into downtown. First stop was the post office. I was debating whether to bump my box with the new shoes or open it, but ultimately decided on the latter as my old ones are rubbing against my feet. I also had a care package that I had bumped from Damascus, but for some reason got rerouted back there and should come tomorrow. Which isn’t a big deal, but I’m not exactly sure what’s in it so I can’t go food shopping yet.Then we walked around a bit and went to a pub for a drink. They didn’t have the best food, so went across the street where Braino got a steak he had been waiting for. We got a few more beers, and then ran into Braveheart is another Aussie section hiking and her friend from  Raleigh.After a few more drinks, we took a taxi to Walmart which was a fun experience with a knackered Australian.Finally got back to our motel around 9.

That hasn’t happened to me after hiking at all, but I must have been too dehydrated from the beers!Got out of bed around 6 and took care of cleaning gear. I was sitting outside in the parking lot doing things on my phone when I hear “Hey, Half Full!” from a passing car. Turns out it was Finger Lickin, AZ, and Fuego. AZ did the trail a couple years ago and Fuego his son joined for a few weeks. Today was his last day so they were trying to find everyone in their trail family to visit and give trail magic. We had only hiked with them a few days, I think they were looking for Tracks who was at the Chinese buffet, but gave us snacks anyway. I hope to catch up to AZ and Finger Lickin at some point.Braino and I went to Ingles and caught the shuttle downtown. I was super excited because the farmers market was open. Unfortunately, it was only a few booths and none had produce. So we went to look for proper breakfast, although by this time was lunch so got delicious burgers.We went to catch the shuttle back, but while we were waiting a car pulled up and a couple of hikers got in. Turns out it was a trail angel that just drives hikers around Marion. They were going to Walmart which was right by the motel, so it worked out perfectly. I stopped by Ingles for my resupply and was able to spend only 20 bucks (it helped getting an awesome care package, plus leftovers and hiker boxes.Braino was taking a zero and staying another night, so I had all my stuff in his room. I was sorting food and packing gear when i realized I didn’t have my rain jacket. After some thinking and calling all the places I had been, found out i left it at the restaurant. Which was downtown, and I was going to take the shuttle back to the trail from the motel.Braino helped with problem solving with timing and I ended up taking a cab downtown and then the shuttle from there. It all worked out and in the end only costed a few bucks. Whew! Soon i will include the sad list of everything I have forgotten or lost...Swedie Pie was also on the shuttle to the trail, but I left the visitors center before him. I got on trail around 3 and didn’t see anyone all afternoon. It was perfect weather, terrain wasn’t too bad and even got one small view.I got to the shelter around 6 and was unimpressed. The privy was closed (never seen that before) and no good camping spots. I really wanted to tent and it sounded like there were good spots ahead, but not for a few miles and I didn’t want to get in late. I had a snack to think about it, and the clouds looked dark so ultimately decided to stay in the shelter, the first time in a while.About fifteen minutes later Hummingbird showed up, she debated the options as well, but found a spot since she has a smaller tent. A bit later, Swedie Pie showed up and decided to shelter. Later on when I was hanging my bear bag I found a perfect spot, but oh well at least it wasn’t crowded.

He was mad because mice got into the food bag he hung far from the shelter. I didn't get out until 8, after Swedie and Hummingbird.The morning was mostly sunny skies. A couple of miles in was an old one room schoolhouse, Lindamood. Now it is used for trail magic- a church leaves snacks/supplies in boxes and I think comes in and cooks every once in a while. There is also some fun artifacts like a list of ""punishments"" from the 1800s. It was flat and easy to the highway, where I met Ezra at The Barn Restaurant. He is the first friend that has met up with me, we had talked about Grayson but this is what worked schedule-wise. Which is probably better since it rained all of Grayson. Ezra joined Swedie Pie and me for breakfast (they have an all you can eat buffet but we were too early and it sounded gross) and brought me awesome produce and homemade jerky. The Barn let him park there, which was nice.Ezra, Julius (his dog) and I started around 11 and the first part was a flat scenic meadow. Unfortunately it turned into uphill in the woods and Ezra doesn’t have trail legs so was a bit rough. I honestly didn’t even consider this... how far I’ve gotten with trail legs and the discrepancy with normal day hikers. I don’t want to sound arrogant or condescending, and no offense to Ezra who is a fine casual hiker, just that thru hikers are at a completely different pace and endurance level than those without trail legs. I do want to hike with other friends but now it’s almost hard for me to go that pace. Maybe without a pack and more views would be different because I wouldn’t mind going slow.Most of the day was in the green tunnel, but did get some views from meadows. We didn’t stop for lunch (a new concept for me!) and made it to our campsite around 6. Dark clouds had threatened, but we stayed dry hiking and setting up camp.

I went on a couple miles to a shelter, but everyone had left for the day.It was pretty easy terrain, and made good time. My goal was a shelter in 22 miles, and since I left at 8 shouldn’t be a problem right? Unfortunately there was a steep 4 mile climb up Chestnut Knob. There is a stereotype that Virginia is flat, and yes it doesn’t have the crazy peaks and gaps of Georgia but is not exactly a sidewalk!At least there was a reward at the top - beautiful walk along exposed ridge leading to a cool stone shelter that used to be some sort of cabin. Everyone was just chilling in the grass. As I rolled in, Mike the Chemist was just leaving. It was nice to see a familiar face and catch up as I hadn’t seen him since before Damascus.I stayed at the top for about an hour and even debated staying the night since it was actually clear, but wanted to put in more miles.The afternoon was generally easy terrain with a few tough uphills. At one of the road crossings, a guy got out of his truck and asked if I wanted a soda. I asked if he had anything else but that was it. I should have just moved on then, but he did all this work taking out a cooler so I felt obligated. He also didn’t mention it was a diet root beer. Yeah, it tasted about as good as that sounds in the middle of a long hot hike. Sat in my stomach for while, and I felt more guilty because there were other hikers behind me that probably would have enjoyed it.Finally got to the path to the shelter around 6, and according to the guide the water source was further up the trail. So I put down my pack to grab water and found some nice campsites. When I got up to the shelter, there was a big group of young thru hikers that seemed loud and partiers. So I ended up setting my tent up all the way back down by the creek. As soon as I had it set up, the group walked past... apparently they weren’t staying at the shelter and were looking for a side trail to a lake for fishing. Yup. I ended up going back to the shelter to cook food, there were a bunch of sites and only about 5 people camping but oh well.When the group walked back from their expedition, one of the guys saw my bear bag and said it was one of the best hangs he’s seen. I think he was exaggerating and might have been drunk, but still felt good to hear as this has been one of my challenges.It definitely felt good to do over 20 miles again, especially since I was mostly alone.

The terrain was pretty easy and everything was clicking.A couple hours in, I saw something ahead on the trail I couldn’t tell was a hiker or an animal. It kept waiting until I got close then ran around the corner. Turns out it was a deer with her baby (fawn?). We played this “game” (I’m assuming since they are wild was not a game to them) for a few minutes. At one point the baby kind of got trapped down a ridge between me and the mother. I wasn’t really sure what to do, tried to show I meant no harm!Made it to the highway around 11:30. It is a major road by an interstate, and the town of Bland was about 3 miles away. At first I was planning that for my resupply, but they didn’t really have anything there. I had so much already and turns out there was a small store right on the trail. It is called Brushy Mountain Outpost and also has a small restaurant. I got a delicious cheeseburger with Cajun fries for less than five bucks. There were a bunch of other hikers there, but I didn’t recognize them. Looks like Philly Crew was here yesterday. And the hiker box had a pack of 6 tortillas, which was just what I needed!After crossing over the interstate, the trail wove back into the woods. I went ahead of everyone, and the trail followed along the ridge. Unfortunately, there were no water sources (one of the drawbacks of not having rain) and I was feeling the long day.A couple miles before the end was a gravel road with 600 written on it. 600 miles! It feels like just hit 500 in Grayson (I guess it was last Wednesday).I got to the shelter around 6, and to my chagrin there weren’t many campsites away from the shelter. I wanted my own space, but wasn’t sure I wanted to camel up and go to a further site down the trail that didn’t have water since I was dehydrated. I went on all these side trails looking for a spot, and by that time had walked so much I was even more tired. So I decided to stay after more indecisiveness. I ended up picking a bad, rocky spot that was on a slope but at least I was happy it wasn’t too crowded. Then a few minutes later a couple big groups showed up and it was packed and loud. I was hoping they’d move on, but stayed. So it ended up being super crowded and they were up late (aka 9). I was really looking forward to an early quiet night (usually everyone goes to bed around 8). At least there was a privy!After getting that compliment about my bear hang yesterday, I was on a bit of a high. Well, tonight I got the carabiner stuck in a tree which sucked. I was able to cut the line and rethrow it, borrowing someone else's carabiner. Luckily I will be in town soon and can replace. I guess I can also not use one and just tie the line (not PCT method) hoping a bear doesn't cut it, or somehow figure out how to do the knot to run it through...","Jenkins Shelter

After getting up and down the ridge, the trail followed Dismal Creek. Not sure how it got the name, but I took the side trail to Dismal Falls and it was definitely a misnomer. Although not huge, a pretty area with nice pools for swimming. It was still early and a bit chilly, so I just dipped my feet in and had first lunch. I know a bunch of others were going to hitch to a gas station at the road crossing before and grab beers and spend the day at the falls, but I wanted to get going and all my friends were ahead or behind.I stopped for second lunch at Wapiti Shelter. Not sure the exact story, but I think a couple was murdered here in the 90s. I guess they wanted to shed some of the negative feelings so actually moved the shelter but never changed the name. I will say it was a nice new privy!I may have mentioned this before, but each section of trail is managed by a different local club. I believe there are about a dozen total and most cover about 50-200 miles of trail. It is all volunteers, so for that section you basically get the infrastructure they provide (with nod to CCC and Forest Service). Anyway, I have been quite pleased with the Virginia Clubs (Mt. Rogers, Piedmont, Roanoke) shelters, especially compared to some other areas (cough cough Tennessee).After the shelter was a big climb back to the ridge. But it didn’t seem as bad as Chestnut Knob or some of the others, maybe because I just took it slow and steady. There were a couple of good views from the top, which is always nice to get out of the green tunnel. Not huge mountains and ridges, but still nice.My plan had been to do 24 miles to Doc Knob Shelter, leaving about 8 Into Pearisburg for tomorrow morning. However, I kept reading great reviews about the Woods Hole hostel. They supposedly had awesome food and a cool atmosphere. I have been really caught up in logistics/planning/miles, so maybe I was blinded by hunger so figured why not. My main reason for hiking isn’t some hippy dippy “finding myself” but more to challenge myself (hence the focus on miles), but I still want to explore and have adventures. Don’t want to miss the forest for the trees (pun intended? I do see a lot of trees...).So I took the gravel road half mile to the hostel. It is actually an old farm from the 1800s that still has some livestock and crops. As I was walking in, I saw Tracks and Rogue Cartographer is knew that was good. A few seconds later I hear “Hey Half Full” and it was the Philly/Big Money Crew! I caught up to them!Since it was nice out, i didn’t feel like staying in the bunkhouse so tented. It was a good decision because the sites overlook a beautiful valley! There was only one other tent, occupied by a nice younger couple. Ball Flap ended up coming later. It was right next to a pen with goats, but luckily they didn’t smell.I had a cold but refreshing shower and hung out on the porch. Around 7 they rang the dinner bell, but first we all gathered and held hands and said what we were thankful for. The whole place is a bit hippy dippy, but still nice.Dinner was a delicious al fresco feast of bread, salad, rice/lentils, and ice cream. It was all homemade, they have great work for stays.

Perfect timing!The driver pointed out a clearing on one of the mountains that looked like it was for power lines. But apparently it was cut recently for a pipeline they are building here that is a big issue. It won’t bring any jobs to the area, but will affect one of its biggest industries- tourism. There are protests and everything. I haven’t heard anything so will have to look into it.I had actually reserved a private room at the hostel since it was the same price as the budget motels but I figured a better atmosphere.

On the way back I went through “downtown” Pearisburg, which was really sad. All of the spaces were closed or vacant. Wonder what Marion got right they didn’t?When I got back to the hostel around 11, everyone was just lounging around lazily. It was a little tough to get motivated, but I got out around noon after finishing a bunch of Food Lion produce. This was actually a huge mistake as you will see.The road walk back to the AT was a little shady with no shoulder and cars going fast. The trail crossed over the New River and then by a big factory, which was a little weird. You could see the cutout for the Mountain Valley Pipeline. It was then a long climb up Peters Mountain, but it was gradual so not bad. My issue was that all of the food mixed together in my stomach and was not happy. I had to dig a few catholes, including one I realized was right next to an ant hill. Biting ants!Also passed a gravel road that lead to the pipeline construction. There was a Forest Service cop sitting there, and lots of signage. Didn’t really see any other people except for a few southbound day hikers.Finally made it to the shelter around 5. Beautiful view into the valley farmland and foothills in the distance. I was originally planning to go further, but figured it might be good to be by a privy just in case, plus I didn’t know if the sites ahead had views.One guy stopped by about half hour later, but moved on. I figured I might be the only one which would have been nice, but Candid showed up a bit later and set up near me.Even though it had been blue skies for days, as soon as the sun was starting to set some dark clouds came in, and we could see it raining and lightning in the valley over in West Virginia. So we quickly put on our rainflys and attached guy lines for the wind, but thought it would miss us to the north. Figured worst case scenario could run to the shelter.Well, were we wrong! It seemed the storm went right over us. The rain and wind picked up, and the thunder started getting louder. The lightning is what worried me being on an exposed mountain, but I was too lazy to run to the shelter. I could feel the pressure change and lightning bright, but luckily were no huge cracks of thunder. After about an hour, it ended and I was fine and dry! Needless to say I fell right asleep.","Angel's Rest Hiker Haven

I was out around 8, Candid was right behind me and the couple that came late were still sleeping in the shelter.The morning was pretty flat all along Peters Mountain. But something on the joint or muscle top of my right foot that had been a slight ting yesterday turned into a sharp pain that shot up my leg. But it was only when I walked so no worries there...A few hours in I took a nasty tumble on a slick rock. It hit the foot in question, plus my leg and bent my pole a bit. Complicating things was the fact no water for 12 miles!I hobbled into the shelter for water and lunch and Candid was already there. I laid out my rib fly to dry, took off my shoes, and proceeded to eat as much food as possible. I was pretty hungry again after basically clearing out my entire insides yesterday. But some part of me felt there would be trail magic coming up.After the long sunny lunch, I finally got going. Not but a quarter mile later, I see a sign for food pointing to a parking lot. I was right! Turns out it was a current thru hiker, Bo, who took a zero and providing trail magic with his mom. They had hot dogs, cold drinks, and snacks. They were so happy to see us, I guess it was a slow day. Also, Bo started on May 9 so he is booking it!After a while there and copious amounts of food in our stomachs, we continued on. We knew it was going to be a climb, but it was pretty long and steep. Candid jumped ahead and I struggled.Finally made it to the shelter on top around 5. I was pretty beat up, was originally planning on a shelter that was still 8 miles away and realized I was not going to make it, plus wanted to rest my leg.An hour later, we get to a parking lot where a couple of guys were hanging out . They said there was a nice camping spot ahead so perfect!I got to Wind Rock shortly after, it had a great view maybe better than Rice Field. There was also a huge swath of grass for tenting. I set up as far from the rocks as possible as I figured it would be a party scene so close to a road.I went up to the rocks to make dinner, and as I was wrapping up they joined for a beautiful sunset. Could see rain in the distance, but it was headed away.They offered me beer but I declined. They were nice though and had a lot of local hiking knowledge. Another thru hiker, Jesus, joined shortly after. He actually left the Angels Rest hotel in Pearisburg this morning and did almost 30 mile day! Sounds like he and Bo are about same schedule. Also, he said he met Brenno last night at the hostel so I am not that far ahead.I was up with them until after 9!","Rice Field Shelter

Caught one last look from the rock and left around 7:15.The beginning was easy and made it to a shelter within a couple hours. Jesus was just leaving there. The rest of the morning involved going up Johns Creek Mountain, which was another long steep climb. The shooting pain on my foot actually felt better on the uphill though.At the top was Kelly Knob, which we were told had an amazing view. It was okay, partly blocked by trees so I think better in winter. Still was nice to catch some rays and have lunch.After descending to Laurel Creek for another privy stop (I always go just in case), it was another big climb up Sinking Creek Mountain. The weather sprinkled while going through some open meadows, but not much. Also passed the Keffer Oak, which I guess is over 300 years old and one of the largest on the trail.At the top of the mountain, I was excited to cruise along the ridge with some good views all the way to the shelter. Some dark clouds came in and it started to rain, but I was under tree cover and it wasn’t too bad so I didn’t worry or put on my rain jacket.Well, a few minutes later just as the storm picked up I got above tree line and had to scramble along slanted wet rocks. If you know anything about me, I don’t have the best balance/coordination, plus being poured on with sweat in my eyes didn’t help my focus. I must have crashed hard into the rocks at least a dozen times and my side/rear were starting to feel it. As the old saying goes, “No Rain, No Pain, No Maine” and I definitely earned my right to Katahdin! (although when I thought this to myself there were a few more expletives...)After about a mile of this, the trail finally dipped below the trees and off the rocky ridge. And like clockwork, the storm passed. In fact the sun came out! I was mad because the ridge actually would have had excellent views, but there was no way I was going back.The last few miles were downhill, but with my torn up body and the wet rocks, it was a struggle. I finally hobbled into the shelter around 6:30. Candid, Duchess, and another lady were all set up inside. When I started looking for a good campsite, they looked at me like I was crazy and said “It could rain more later “ and I was like “yeah probably. That’s why I have a fly”. Crazy that they are thru hikers and I feel more hardcore than them. Shelter just seemed so crowded and it was blue skies for setting up my tent.As I was finishing camp chores, Jesus showed up. It was after 8 and he was thinking of going on! But ultimately stayed.I was half asleep around 10:30 when a couple showed up. They were quiet, but I could still hear them setting up tent and whispering. But I was annoyed and took a while to get back to sleep.","Wind Rock

At the top was a monument to Audie Murphy, who I guess was a famous World War II pilot turned movie star who crashed right by there. I've seen other graves/memorials on the trail, but this one seemed to be pretty well marked with rocks, flags, etc.It was decent climb including some scrambling up to Dragons Tooth, which is a huge pointy stone at the top of Cove Mountain. I saw Jesus and Candid up there and enjoyed the views. Coming down was tough, lots of steep downhill on rocks. There were some rungs but didn’t really help.I thought the rest of the afternoon was going to be easy, but the terrain profile was misleading. There was a gas station convenience store about a half mile off trail, but I had enough food I didn't need to go.I finally made it to the Catawba road crossing that has a big parking lot for McAfee Knob as the rain started. There were two shelters pretty close, when I got to the first one it was a weird scene- someone set up their hammock inside and had all this food out. So I went on to the second, and there was a huge crowd. I was disappointed as I was kind of hoping to stay in the shelter with the rain and getting an early start tomorrow. But turns out it was a group of twenty teenagers with a church youth group. They were actually camping away but using the shelter to cook. I was overwhelmed feeling claustrophobic with all the people, so hung away until they cleared out.Jesus and Candid showed up shortly later (they had gone off trail to a gas station) and thought we would have lots of room. A couple of section hikers showed up later, but there was still room.","Niday Shelter

I was out first at 7, figuring it would be a tough rocky climb up to the knob and Candid and Jesus would pass me so we could be up together. On the contrary, it was a nice gradual uphill mostly dirt. There were a few groups coming down, I'm assuming were hoping to catch a view at the top. Unfortunately, it was all fogged in. Still was a cool rock that jutted out and could imagine the view!The rest of the day was pretty easy hiking along the ridge all the way to Daleville. The clouds cleared a bit and we got some views of the Carvins Cove Reservoir. It was only 18 miles and weather wasn't horrible, so I was debating just resupplying and moving on, but figured my body could use a little rest.The road the AT comes out in is actually a busy 4 lane highway so a little risky crossing. I checked into the Super 8 and emptied some of my bag. Walked a half mile to the outfitter/grocery store, I believe I saw the Philly Crew/Professor but not sure. Leaving the parking lot I saw a few thru hikers I recognized, Charzard and I forget the other. Turns out they are actually staying with their shuttle driver, and he let them use his car! So they gave me a ride back to the hotel which was nice.I got dinner from the store, so the rest of the day was just relaxing, laundry, and using hotel computer.

It was an easy uphill leaving town under blue skies. Even though I only needed a couple days of food, of course I bought too much so my bag was heavy. Stopped at the first shelter for a privy run and saw Odys and Cam.Pretty easy terrain all the way to the next shelter for lunch. There we had a big crew group - Philly Crew, Double O, Odys, Big Money, Seamus and Cam. Everyone was trying to get rid of heavy produce they bought in town, so it was like a potluck feast!The afternoon was pretty easy as well. About halfway through, the trail met up with the Blue Ridge Parkway and basically followed along or near it. This was interesting because it wasn’t great being next to cars, but there were a lot of great views with the cuts for the road! Dark clouds threatened and we could see thunderstorms in the valley, but only got a sprinkle. There was a guy going southbound that pointed out some fresh raspberries in the bushes. I would have totally missed them so will need to start paying better attention.The shelter was only 18 miles in and down a steep side trail. I didn’t feel like pulling to the next one and didn’t want to camel up on water to stealth, so set up off the AT away from the shelter. The group had a long discussion about staying or moving on but ultimately decided to stay (they are as indecisive as me!). It was nice because good group (Ball Flap and a couple sectioners joined) with a campfire and they had packed up s’mores ingredients.

Spent a good amount of time there cleaning off all the sweat.After that was a short but steep climb over Fork Mountain. Was ready for lunch so stopped at the Bryant Creek Shelter, which is three stories and looks more like a House than a lean to.Coming up Floyd Mountain and really most of the afternoon was tough. I was like wait, what happened to my trail legs? And my pack was pretty light only a day of food.After passing an odd looking FAA tower and The Guillotine (a small rock awkwardly supported you walk under) I finally made the shelter. Double O and Ball Flap were already there. I found a grassy area and started to set up my tent, and realized the area was crawling with bugs. Wasn’t any better other sites so I figured I could just hide in my tent. Some people went on, but there wasn’t anything good ahead, plus this one had a bear box in addition to water and privy.Cooking wasn’t the most fun, especially when the biting gnats came, but I made do. Met a guy named Misty who had foot issues and had to take a bunch of zeros. Sounds like he also had something similar on the top of the foot as me, he said it’s an inflamed tendon and in addition to rest/ice/elevate, massaging it might help.Shred, Odys, and Big Money came shortly later and all set up tents in one small grassy area...think they had about 8 crammed in when it was meant for two or three!","Bobblets Gap Shelter

On the other side is a parking lot where I met the Francises, Red Crossers from Durham. No one visits me for six weeks and then I get three in the following two weeks!Anyway, they brought a bunch of fresh food for a picnic and there were a bunch of hikers eating under the bridge so it also became trail magic!

I said goodbyes, hope to see them in Waynesboro or at least Harpers Ferry when Big Money completes her hike.Kim and Micheal chauffeured me to the grocery store in Glasgow so I could resupply. Both the store and the town were smaller than I imagined and the people were a little... different. And this is not my first small town in Virginia but it was definitely sketch. They randomly did have a farmers market open, not a lot of produce but I was still impressed.I needed to find a table to go through my purchases and rebag. We drove to Natural Bridge State Park which is not as cool as it sounds, so found a road pullout. They opened the gate to the truck bed and I showed them the process (pouring oats into ziplocks, etc). It is so second nature to me now, I didn’t think how weird it looks.They finally said goodbyes and I hit the trail again. Luckily, I was only going a couple of flat miles to the next shelter.

I don’t know if I was too tired or what, but the whole process took an hour and a half, negating the chance to really rest my feet. Luckily since I had so much food at lunch I wasn’t really hungry for dinner so just had a pastry from the farmers market. Fortunately it wasn't too buggy.

Don’t think I’ve seen her since Hot Springs! She was going southbound so she can end near Roanoke then fly to New York to meet a friend. She is still making pretty good time though!I took a long lunch at the Punchbowl Shelter (where I think my group stayed last night, at least Ball Flap did), and elevated my feet. There was a family there when I arrived and when they found out I was thru hiking the dad asked me a bunch of questions, said he would love to do. He offered me water, but I had just filled. He apologized they didn’t have any food and they all left. I thought that was the end until he came back alone and sheepishly offered me weed. I told him I was probably one of the few people that don’t smoke, but thanks anyway. In hindsight I should have accepted so I could use it for trading! He was funny though, like trying to be a serious adult father but by himself still a kid.The afternoon was pretty flat and easy, but I still took it slow and arrived at the shelter later than planned .

No addition to the pain, I had to worry about not sweating as much on my left side so started only using my right pole. This was only somewhat successful since it was so hot I was basically sweating all over.I went to the next shelter to regroup and elevate my feet. I knew Four Step was ahead of me, but I figured everyone else passed me during the break. Fedex was just walking by so we hiked together up Three Ridges Mountain.

I wanted to be finished setting up before sunset so I could enjoy the view so started to book it. I also needed to camel up on water since there was none at the top. There was a spring about a mile before but it was only trickling. Magically, someone had left about eight 2 liter bottles filled with tap water. The trail provided!I was hoping it would be an easy climb at the end, but unfortunately were some of the biggest steps I’ve seen so far.

Gotta love the long days of summer! The bugs were pretty bad even though I was a few thousand feet up, so wouldn’t have helped much if I had gotten in sooner anyway.

The morning was mostly flat with a few ups and downs. There were a couple views as well, although more of farmland than mountains. Guess I should start getting used to that!
I stopped for water break at the Wolfe Shelter which was awesome. It sits right behind a bunch of cascades and has great tent spots. The shelter has a covered picnic table and counter as well. It looked pretty new, only issue was a weird design that didn’t really maximize the space.
I got to Rockfish Gap around noon and called the hostel for a shuttle. Stanimal was actually on his way to pick someone else up further on so it was only a couple minutes. Then we drove down the Blue Ridge Parkway to pick up Ranger Z, another hiker. It was interesting seeing the views from the road.
The hostel is pretty nice, it has small bunk rooms and I found a bed in a little alcove with a curtain in one so it is semi-private. Stanimal was very welcoming and personable, sounds like a one man show so a bit overwhelmed.
After showering, I went across the street to a steakhouse that has an all you can eat (AYCE) buffet. There is actually a well known AYCE Chinese buffet in town called Ming’s, but it was far and I was more in the mood for salad bar.
Well, two hours and about eight plates and bowls later, I was full. Well, uncomfortafull actually. I knew I was going to do that, should have just gone to a regular restaurant. But I wasn’t hungry for dinner so was able to knock out two meals for ten bucks. Can’t beat that! The food wasn’t bad, but about what you would expect. The locals definitely gobbled it up. I can’t imagine going there without the hiker hunger! If I recall correctly, I had:
Plate of salad with cornbreadPlate of additional veggies with blue cheese dressing and cottage cheeseLoaded baked potatoCup of beef vegetable soup with rollCup of broccoli cheese soupPlate of Mac and cheese, baked ziti, fries, butter beans, and small steakBowl of apple pie topped with brownie
I wanted to have the chicken, other cooked veggies and fresh fruit but my stomach said please no!
I went back to the hostel to recover and do laundry. I am not used to zeroing and usually am running around to resupply, etc. so it was nice to just chill in my alcove. A big thunderstorm came through so it was good to be in town!
I actually got a little hungry later so went to the store and grabbed some naked juice and stuff for breakfast. No one came into the other bed in the alcove so I had plenty of room.

They shuttled me and another hiker, Mademoiselle, to the trail about 8. She is from France but actually nice and not pretentious. It was about a mile to the Shenandoah permit kiosk. They are free and more for tracking/safety.I leapfrogged Mademoiselle a couple of times and the terrain was pretty easy (even though I had a heavy bag full of food). I did get confused a couple times where the trail was due to side trails and lack of blazes. I’m also a little confused why it’s a National Park- no offense it is pretty and all but the National Forest to the south was much prettier. Even when crossing overlooks on Skyline Drive I wasn’t impressed. Guess that’s why some people aqua blaze here (canoe/kayak instead of hiking). I was looking into it, but was expensive and logistically complicated.Some storms came through in the afternoon, but luckily was just rain. I got to the hut (what shelters here are called) early, around 5, but it was already pretty full. I think it was mostly people that just came from the last shelter.

Surprisingly, none of the old people snored and they stayed in bed a while.I got out around 7:30 to fog but it wasn’t raining. The easy terrain continued and I got to the Loft Mountain campground in a couple hours.Shenandoah has a few car camping facilities that are near the AT (since the trail basically follows Skyline Drive). The nice thing is they also have amenities for thru hikers - bathrooms, showers, laundry, convenience store, and restaurant.When I got to the store complex, there was a group of young adults hanging around in their sleeping bags. Turns out they were section hikers who tented in the campground but got flooded out. They decided to cut their trip short so had a bunch of extra food. I grabbed a mountain house and some oatmeal packets. I went in the store where they had a smoothie machine. This was very exciting to me, but it wasn’t really working. When we finally got it to work, I wished it hadn’t as I was disappointed- basically ice with sugar. Not sure why I expected better.But then I got a great idea. I put the free oatmeal in a coffee cup and heated in the microwave- warm oatmeal and no cook stove required! Was especially nice as the smoothie was cold.The rest of the day was pretty uneventful. The weather was perfect as I wasn’t sweating or dealing with bugs, but sad all the views were fogged in. The trail was pretty muddy and wet in some places. A couple of parts were basically creeks. Every time my shoes dried out, they’d get wet again. And creek crossings were a bit more treacherous than normal. But overall I was dry! Plus hit the 900 mile mark.Made it to the shelter pretty early again, and there were a few people already inside including Misty. I was debating tenting, but didn’t see any great spots and everyone was saying we might get a few inches again, so set up inside. Mademoiselle arrived shortly later.Just as we were wrapping up dinner, a brief downpour came but it only lasted half an hour. But the water falling off the trees worries me because I think there’s a few leaks in the shelter above my spot!","Blackrock Hut

Unfortunately, even though I used the privy at the shelter, I had to cathole it 20 minutes later. That is the second day in a row I’ve had to cathole shortly after leaving camp which is really annoying. Will have to figure out another system.The morning was foggy and pretty easy. There was a picnic area with a parking lot a few miles in, but the water was turned off. The sign said it was due to “low water” which was funny because everywhere seemed flooded.A few hours later was the Lewis Mountain Campground. I wasn’t planning on stopping there, but the trail went right by the camp store. I just got a juice and yogurt to supplement my lunch as I need to reduce my pack weight! On the way out we passed a car camper that was providing trail magic. He had just gotten back from purchasing supplies so didn’t really have anything set up yet, but did give us some chips and sodas for a nice dessert.The afternoon was super easy, including what I think were the three flattest miles on the trail. And we actually got some blue skies for a change.Around 5 I reached the turn for Big Meadows. I wasn’t sure about going to the wayside here as it was supposed to be almost a mile round trip, but Jason a section hiker kept talking about burgers all day. It really wasn’t that long off trail, and I was glad I went because it randomly poured for the half hour I was inside.They had a to go counter which was nice so I could be quick. I got a cheeseburger and one of their famous blackberry milkshakes. I had low expectations and everything was ok. About what you’d expect from a touristy spot. The milkshake mostly tasted like milk and sugar, I guess blackberry is a subtle flavor (or they skimped).When I got out it was sunny skies again so decided I still had time to press on to the next shelter. Actually got some views from the overlooks for the first time since entering the park, so that was nice. It was looking west so could see the sun setting in the valley and foothills behind it.When I got to the shelter there were a few people here including Misty. The tent options left weren’t great, so had to set up on a slope. At least I know my feet will be elevated! Hopefully rain holds out tonight because I didn’t couldn’t stake out my fly very well.Luckily there was a bear box so made finishing camp chores easier.

I was a little delayed because one of the section hikers was giving away a bunch of food!The morning was mostly blue skies and finally got to enjoy some views. About an hour in, I saw a bear! It was just a cub, about 30 feet away in the woods and scurried away when he saw/heard me. A bit later, I passed a guy that pointed out a mom and her cubs. Two bear sightings in one day after none on the AT yet! Although they are everywhere here- some people have seen ten a day. Maybe I’m just too loud or something.In a few hours I got to Skyland, which has a lodge and restaurant. They have an All You Can Eat Breakfast, but after the trail magic I figured it would just make me sick so just got some fruit from the cafe.There was a picnic area not much later, but I saw some hikers I knew so decided to stop for lunch early, because I hadn’t eaten in ten minutes.When I got to the next shelter, some section hikers were in there because dark clouds were coming in and could hear thunder. I was thinking about the same but got antsy so decided to press on. I figured if I could make it past the exposed peak of Mary’s Rock in a mile, it would be downhill and I would be covered (and not at the highest point in case lightning).So I was running down the trail with my pack as it was sprinkling. I had the rain cover on, but didn’t want to take the time to put on my jacket and figure I would overheat anyway. I made it to the peak before it got too bad and thought I was safe. Well, what I didn’t expect was the downhill was all switchbacks down and exposed cliff. 99 percent of the Park is green tunnel, and this has to be exposed?! The heavens started opening up and was too late to put on my jacket, I was soaked. I just went down as fast as I could to get cover. Luckily, it wasn’t thundering or lightning too badly. Was definitely double thinking my decision to not wait out the storm though!About an hour later, when I finally got down to a gap and normal tree cover, the rain stopped and the sun came out. Yep, as soon as I was past all of the exposed views. It was glorious though, was so nice to see! There were some other dark clouds that threatened, but the rest of the afternoon stayed dry.Got to the Elkwallow Wayside around 6 and got a sandwich, even though I had so much food I needed to eat. And I ended up getting blackberry ice cream as well, which was much better than the milkshake. A few other hikers were drying their gear out too. So it was another double wayside day. I’ve gotten used to these, it will be weird going back to days with no amenities!Had originally thought about pulling a 28 mile day to the next shelter, but my feet were done. Misty and I just went to the first unofficial site about a mile ahead. There was one guy there (I think “knuckles”?) and the ground was super rocky, but it would work. And since I had already eaten dinner, that saved some time.","Rock Spring Hut

Not sure why I didn’t sleep well, maybe kept rolling off my pad? I accidentally put my pillow in the dryer in Waynesboro and now it doesn’t inflate all the way so maybe that was it.Anyway, I got out around 6:30 after catholing it and leapfrogged Misty back and forth. The morning was pretty easy and I was booking it, almost running on some of the flats and downhills. Wasn’t the plan, but ended up doing another ten before ten (10 miles before 10 am). There were a few views, but nothing great.A few hours in, I ran into a hiker going southbound I hadn’t seen since the NOC. Can’t remember his name, but I think he is an EMT from Richmond. Due to some logistics he had to skip around and already finished Pennsylvania and is now going south from Harpers Ferry.About a mile from the northern Shenandoah National Park boundary, I saw another bear cub! It was like it was bidding me farewell, not sure the bear situation ahead but there were definitely a lot in the Shennies!I got to the road crossing to Front Royal around 1:30, so I did 18.5 miles in seven hours including a twenty minute break at a spring. There was a guy with cold waters offering $5 rides to town, which was about four miles away. I was originally planning to take the local bus, but it wasn’t coming for another hour and I wanted to get going. There were a few hikers trying to hitch, but not having luck since it was a fast blind corner with no good pull off area. So I took the guy up on his offer. I was able to share the ride with Sunrise, a hiker from Japan who also needed to go to the post office, so it was only a couple bucks.After picking up my care package, I walked around downtown. It is pretty cute, some empty storefronts but a lot going on. Including a beer museum! I didn’t go there, but I did check out the local brewery. They were supposed to have laundry and shower facilities, but weren’t working. I stopped by the visitor center that has gift bags for thru hikers. The only useful thing was a granola bar, but it was a nice thought.I stopped by an outfitter and a health food store before the supermarket, but forgot what I bought there so ended up resupplying a lot for only a couple of days needed.Walking out of the parking lot, a car drove by and I asked if they were headed towards the trail. They said no and I walked on, but they pulled over and told me to get in. Real nice couple and I think they went a few miles out of their way.The evening I booked it as well since the Shelter was still five miles away. It was worth it though, one of the nicest on the trail. Adirondack chairs, solar shower, horseshoe pit, and toilet paper in the privy! Misty was just getting in as well.I didn’t finish everything until almost nine, but I think I will sleep well tonight!","Piney Ridge Junction

The hurried past two days must have taken a toll on me, I’m not so young anymore! There also weren’t really any views, definitely in the green tunnel now.It was nice not rushing though and trying to enjoy the moment. I spent a while at a shelter for lunch and a couple of benches at meadows.I got to the shelter pretty early (before 6), but figured it would be good to get to bed early and didn’t want to start the Roller Coaster (a series of steep climbs/descents) yet. I set up my tent on a side trail far away from everyone just to ensure a good night sleep.After dinner and chores I was in bed by 8. Definitely observing hiker midnight tonight!","Denton Shelter

Pretty soon there was a sign for The Roller Coaster, a 14 mile stretch of short, steep climbs and descents with few views.All day I heard booms, and while it rained a bit I don’t think it was from thunder. Maybe there is a military training facility close?A few hours in, I hit the thousand mile mark. Since reroutes have extended the trail to 2,190 miles it is not the halfway point but still a good milestone. There was another hiker picking blueberries right before it so we got to have a feast!I got to a shelter around 11 and wasn’t planning on lunch, but it started to rain so I ate early. A couple other people showed up, so I hung around for a bit. Just as I was packing up to leave, Seamus walks in and shortly after was the whole mighty duck crew! I thought they were ahead of me, but I guess they also zeroed in Waynesboro. It was good to catch up, sounds like they will all be splitting up in Harpers as Big Money is finishing and some are visiting friends.A few miles after the shelter was the sign for the border with West Virginia. This is notable as Virginia is the longest state and many get discouraged in it. Personally, I found the opposite- I got my systems down and everything was clicking. Plus every day seemed to have at least one view or notable point of interest. I’m wondering if it’s people doing ten mile days so they are not seeing as much?The afternoon I tried to go quickly so I didn’t get to the shelter too late. I guess the Roller Coaster was tougher than it felt, as I was only doing two miles an hour.Eventually I saw the sign marking the north end of the Roller Coaster. From there it was smooth sailing along a ridge and the sun even came out!There are two interesting locations I could have stayed at today, but it didn’t work out timing wise. The first was Bear’s Den Hostel, which actually is owned by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) and is located in an old stone mansion. The second was the Blackburn Center, which is operated by the Potomac ATC club and has tenting, bunks, water spigot, and solar shower. Both sounded cool but would have not made sense for my schedule.I didn’t get to the shelter until almost 7, luckily there were tent pads so it made set up easier. Unfortunately, the water was far down a steep hill so I started cooking even later. I didn’t have a chance to eat my snack with the afternoon rush, so actually had a dehydrated meal and a pasta side.

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595635,"Woke up a few times in the night due to heavy rain. I wasn't really expecting it, so didn't really set up my fly the best. But luckily my tent stayed dry. Unfortunately, I had to carry the wet fly out, but will dry it in town.
I got up around 6 and was out at 7:30. The morning was rocky but pretty easy. I ran into Misty and we hiked over the Shenandoah River into Harper's Ferry together. First was a side trail to the ATC office. It was cool because the blue blaze went through Storer College and part of the National Historic Site, with old and storied buildings.
We got to the office around 10am and it was pretty crowded with both hikers and visitors. They had a decent hiker box and some other resources. They also famously take your photo in front of their sign, which eventually gets used for a yearbook if you finish. We stayed there a good amount of time, then walked over to a Pizzeria. They had a 7-topping pizza, and Misty is vegetarian so we got SO many vegetables. Then we stopped by the Post Office, where I got a nice care package.
Then we went to the hostel, which actually had a good basic resupply. Misty bought a few things and went on, will probably be ahead of me for a while unless he takes a bunch of zeros. I checked in and got settled, it is pretty nice house even though expensive (although I think everything here is, more of a cutesy touristy town with fancy Bed and Breakfasts). I hung all my gear to dry out and took care of other chores.
I walked over to the library to update blog and explored Harper's Ferry/Bolivar. Lots of Bed and Breakfasts, Cafes, Antiques, and porches. Not really laid out for hikers but a cute place. I'm glad the hostel had a decent resupply and I ended up getting a salad and fruit from 7/11 - who knew?!
When I got back to the hostel it was pretty full and smelly. Oh well, one night! Tomorrow I will head back to the trail and explore Lower Town Harper's Ferry, which I think has more of the historical sites (and overpriced ice cream shops)...","David Lesser Shelter

Around 7 I went out to the kitchen and the hostel owner was making waffles. We all hung around and ate for a while. There was quite an international contingent; there were a few guys from Germany and a girl from Japan.  I had three waffles, plus orange juice and two bananas, and I probably ate the least of anyone!
I got out around 9 and walked to the coffee shop (had already gone to the bakery yesterday and wasn’t impressed). Cam and Seamus were there! My intention was to get a sandwich to go, but I ended up eating a piece of coffee cake there and getting a bagel to go, which I promptly ate outside.
I walked down the side trail back to the AT. Shortly I reached Jefferson Rock, which was supposed to have good views. It did of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers, but not really of Harpers Ferry.
I continued on to Lower Town. There were a lot of historic structures there. Lewis and Clark supplied for their journey  here, some railroad rivalry, then of course John Brown’s raid and the Civil War. I passed by another cafe, but instead of picking up a sandwich for lunch I ate a pistachio muffin and cranberry scone. Then across the street was the other hostel with a cafe inside. I’m glad I stayed at the one I did because it was pretty cluttered. Instead of getting a sandwich to go, I got a root beer float. Yes, for those keeping track I ate: 3 waffles, 2 bananas, egg and cheese bagel, coffee cake, muffin, scone, and float all before 11am! I never got that sandwich, but was so full I didn’t need lunch.
Finally leaving all the tourists and history exhibits, the trail crossed the Potomac and followed a canal trail. Apparently we crossed into Maryland here, but I didn’t realize at the time and there were no good signs. Aiden joined me, he is a section hiker who stayed at the hostel last night. He took a gap year off between high school and college and is really chill. After a few miles, the trail went up the ridge but wasn’t bad. Then it was basically smooth sailing the rest of the day.
Leapfrogged Seamus, Cam and Aiden most of the day. We passed Gathland State Park, which has the estate of George Anthony Townsend (“Gath”). He was a big newspaper journalist during the Civil War but died alone and penniless. But the park had bathrooms and running water so it worked out! Passed a few more Civil War battle sites, was weird to think about the fact that soldiers were killed on the hills we were walking through. Like Harpers Ferry was different because that seemed historical, but this seemed like natural areas.
Got to the shelter I was planning to stay at by five, so decided to press on. Just a couple miles later was a “backpackers campground” that had bathrooms, showers, and bear poles that everyone was staying at so it worked out well.

Still haven’t gotten used to that yet. At least there were signs indicating what we’re looking at. And they had potable water!
At lunch I was reviewing the guide and realized I would get to the shelter I was planning on tenting at way early. The next one would make it a 28 mile day. Well, better hustle then!
In the late afternoon I arrived at PenMar Park. As the name suggests, it is right on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It is a huge complex with shelters, parking, bathrooms, etc. They were supposed to have a concession stand, but it was closed. I met up with Cam and Seamus there, who were planning to hitch for a resupply. We were deciding which of the events would be easier to crash - wedding or one year old birthday party. Was really thinking it was a good spot for trail magic and since it’s the weekend...
The last few miles weren’t bad and I still got to the shelter around 6:30. Unfortunately the water was far, so I didn’t get done with everything until late. But there was a nice flat formal tent pad and the only others there were Organic and  Bob who were chill. There was no bear pole and none of us felt like throwing line or thought it would be an issue. The first time I haven’t really done something will my smellies.

Right out of the shelter was a stream. Turns out I had read the guide wrong- I thought it was the trickle to the south it was actually to the north. So I didn’t have to go a half mile out of the way last night. Oh well, I could use the exercise!
There were two shelters plus a picnic area with water in the first few miles, which is strange because usually they are 5-10 miles apart. And I think there is a stretch in a couple days where it’s twenty miles between them.
There was a good overlook at Chimney Rocks that actually was of trees/parkland, not just flat farms. I stayed up there a while figuring out some logistics for the next few weeks.
I crossed a road right before the shelter for lunch and turns out there was trail magic! A guy whose son did the AT last year was in town and had cold drinks and cookies. I stayed there a while and Cam and Seamus caught up. They said there was a state park with a pool in a couple of miles. Originally I had planned to do 23 to a shelter, but considering all my breaks already, change of plans! One of the cliches you hear a bunch on the trail (after “hike your own hike”) is “smiles before miles”. Meaning don’t get too wrapped up in covering ground you don’t appreciate all it has to offer. Since I did a big day yesterday and I am trying not to go through PA too fast (which is hard because it’s SO flat), I decided to take it easy.
Caledonia State Park is a huge complex that was super busy (not surprising as it is a summer weekend). The pool was packed with kids and cost money, so we just hung out at the creek next to it. The water only went up to ankles, but it still felt nice. A lot of people were grilling, it smelled good but had to stick to concession stand ice cream
After a few hours, we figured should get going but still got to the shelter pretty early. It was actually a really cute shelter (and I realize that phrase is rarely uttered). There were flowerpots, a sundial, etc.

A few hours in, I hit “1095.45” spelled out in rocks, which is the official halfway mark for this year (it always changes due to trail reroutes). Shortly after that was a recent sign marking the halfway point given 2017 distance (which was actually shorter than this year but I think it was placed after the actual mileage). Then I hit the 1,100 mile mark (with stones), and shortly after that the old school halfway sign. So in the span of a few miles, I hit four halfway marks!
Overall the terrain was pretty easy, and I got to Pine Grove Furnace State Park around lunch, over 17 miles in less than six hours. Pine Grove is home to a convenience store/grill known for the “half gallon challenge”. This involves eating a half gallon of Hershey’s ice cream. Since they don’t sell that size anymore, you actually have to get the 1.5 quart tub and then and extra hand-scooped pint. When I got there, Cam, Seamus, and a bunch of other hikers were doing the challenge. I debated it, but co concluded all it would do is make me sick so I opted for a burger and fries instead (with ice cream for dessert of course). They also had a small resupply, which wasn’t the cheapest but meant I didn’t have to get off trail.
There was supposed to be an AT Museum next door, but it was closed. Someone said it was because they didn’t have enough volunteers (I could never relate!) but was disappointing because I bet they have some cool stuff.
However, further on in the park was a nice lake with a beach. Given the scalding temperatures outside, this seemed like a natural stop. They even had showers so I was glad I brought my Dr. Bronners. We hung out there a while, and I cooked dinner there since water was plenty. 
A bunch of people were continuing on to the next shelter seven miles away, but since I had already done 17 and was trying to take it easy, figured I’d just stop at the first unofficial campsite. I decided to keep my sandals on since it was a short walk and I didn’t feel like putting on socks and shoes, which probably wasn’t the smartest idea considering a full pack and a rocky uphill.
I reached the trail for an overlook and decided to see what was there. A couple were camping about a tenth of a mile in at a nice big spot, but I wanted to be closer to the overlook so continued on. The vista was nice so I set up on a less-than-ideal stealth spot so I could watch the sunset then crawl right into bed.","Quarry Gap Shelter

A lot of people were worried about this, but I thought it was fun and a good change.
The shelter I lunched at was a bit off trail and right before town, so I don’t think many people go there.
Next I went over Center Point Knob, which had ANOTHER marker for halfway done with the trail. It was a steep climb up and down so I’m glad at least something was there. It also was the border for the Cumberland Valley ATC club. It is sad to leave the Potomac ATC club, which has been since the Shennies and very good shelters. There are no shelters for the next 20 miles! Apparently it used to be the “Cumberland Valley Road Walk” until the ATC/government enacted eminent domain and had it go through formerly private lands.
The trail went through a few pastures which was nice. The ground was soft and flat, and even though in the sun not super buggy.
A quarter mile before town was a “ backpackers campsite”. It’s nice that the town provides this, especially since there isn’t any camping or shelter for a while. It is apparently loud right by railroad tracks so we will see! I set up my tent and went into town.
I stopped at the cafe for early dinner and Bob stopped by but I wanted a beer so went to the tavern. Apparently in Pennsylvania you can’t buy beer at the gas station. It was a little overpriced for the carry out, but oh well.

That always happens on roads; in the woods it is easy to see where to go!
The morning went quickly, mostly going through pastures or the woods next to them. I did find a bunch of raspberries that complemented my bagel. The weather was cloudy so not as hot as it’s been (ie triple digits heat index).
For lunch I stopped at a barn the ATC uses for work crews that has a picnic table and water spigot. What I didn’t realize is that it’s also a popular spot for locals to go tubing on the river. Let’s just say... there were some colorful characters.
The afternoon was a little tougher, but not bad. I rested at the next shelter which had the “Taj Majal” privy (even signed accordingly). Someone wrote it was bigger than their whole apartment!
The skies darkened and I could hear thunder, but only got sprinkled on and the thunder passed, so figured I was safe.
When I got to the shelter, there was only an old section hiker inside. I figured it wouldn’t be very popular as it was a ways off trail, the water was further, and we are only a few miles from town. As old men are notorious for snoring and signs warned of a “porcupine party”,  I decided to tent. Unfortunately, there weren’t really any good spots. Which was disappointing because the last shelter had so many! I found a sloped rocky spot, but figured since the storm passed I wouldn’t have to worry too much about rain.
Well, as I was getting water after setting up my tent, the heavens opened up. If I had just waited 15 minutes I would have set up in the shelter. But at least I was dry and could dry out my tent in town tomorrow. It was also a good test of some of the holes I had taped on the rain fly.
I escaped to the shelter to cook and figure out some logistics. When I got back to the tent, the fly was soaked and the outside of the bathtub was super muddy, but the inside was dry.

But I knew sometimes you just have those days and have to start walking (or take a zero).
I finally got out at 8:30, my latest in a while, and felt better once the endorphins kicked in. There was supposed to be a good view, but it was all fogged in.
When I got to the road, the Bermans were waiting. They are friends of my parents that spend part of the year in Pennsylvania and drove an hour and a half to see me. We found a park with a picnic table and they set up pastrami sandwiches, homemade macaroni salad, fruit, sliced veggies, and donuts. I hadn’t eaten breakfast yet so I ate a bunch!
Then they drove me to a grocery store. It was interesting because it was a big box store outside of town, but not a chain. They had some of the bargain brands you see other places, but not consistent. And it had a weird layout, for example peanut butter was in frozen foods. But they basically had everything I needed.
We looked for a table so I could lay everything out and go through, and guess where we found one - the ice cream shop! It was nice because the sun came out and I could dry out my tent. And the ice cream was soft serve and creamy.
I was looking for a computer to update the blog, but the “library” was a room in the church that was only open Wednesday’s. The guide listed a computer repair shop/Internet cafe, but it was closed too even though we were there during business hours. So I figured I would just use my phone and said goodbye to the Bermans. They were very generous (and my fourth awesome visitor for those counting!).
I went to the Doyle, a tavern/motel that has been around for over a hundred years. I use the term “motel” loosely because it sounds more like a crappy hostel - shared bathrooms, no AC, cockroaches... But it is an AT institution so figured I could grab a beer and check it out. The WiFi was supposed to be working, but I was having issues so didn’t get as much done as I wanted. But good beer and a burger!
Even though it’s been a week since I stayed somewhere and got a real end, shower, and laundry, I didn’t like the options available so continued back on the AT.
The trail goes right through town (which is a little more clustered and has more closed storefronts than somewhere like Boiling Springs), and I stopped by the ice cream shop on the way out for one last scoop. Then it follows a bridge over the Susquehanna River with some good views.
Even though it was only a couple of miles, the uphill out of town was rough. Probably because all of the extra food I was carrying. There were a few fun rock scrambles at the top of the ridge, I guess we’ll see if that continues and “Rocksylvania” lives up to its nickname.
There were decent campsites at the junction with the short trail to the shelter, so I just set up there before going down. I was glad because there weren’t many sites around there. A few people were getting ready for bed, but we hung out for a bit and I put my smellies in the bear box. When I got back up to the trail, someone else had set up which kind of annoyed me as I was hoping for some space, but since it was right off the trail I should have expected as much.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596781,"I left my rain fly doors open last night because it was so warm and I didn’t think it was going to rain. Well, I woke up at 2am to a downpour. I quickly closed the doors and fell back asleep pretty quickly. When I woke up around 6, my fly had mostly dried. However, all my clothes I hung were soaked. Well, I figured they would either dry when I was wearing them or would get soaked again. Someone said the heat advisory was now replaced by flood warning. Good thing we were already up high!
I got out at 8 and the weather was a lot cooler. It sprinkled a bit, but nothing serious. And the trail followed the ridge so that was nice with a couple of views back over the Susquehanna and Duncannon. Unfortunately, it was a bit rocky and my wet socks weren’t helping. I just took it nice and slow, also had to conserve my water because there was a long stretch without.
When I finally got to the spring, it was almost two and I hadn’t had lunch yet. I ended up sitting for over an hour and a half resting my feet and figuring the next towns (no good options if I want resupply and cheap but decent motel or private hostel room).
When I got back on the trail, sun was trying to come out. But I was in the green tunnel and finally feeling bored. This has been an interesting thing because most thru hikers listen to headphones. But so far I have always occupied myself with the natural sounds. I remember seeing a family of day hikers that were maybe half hour from the parking lot trailhead and felt the need to play music out loud. The fact that they couldn’t just be happy with the sounds around them for a short time amazed me. There have been multiple times I am lost in my thoughts or surroundings and get jarred by someone playing music out of their phone.
Well, call me a hypocrite because I have become one of them and put my headphones on. I originally got an iPhone so it could sync with the iTunes on my computer before I left, but that didn’t work. I just figured out how to download podcasts for free and listen to them while in airplane mode. I only have a few This American Life, Invisibilia, and Sounds of the Trail episodes but will be on the lookout for more next time I get WiFi!
The rest of the afternoon went quickly, although some steep and rocky parts slowed me down. I had originally planned on making it to the next shelter, but stopped a group campsite near water. A guy had already set up and a few more came, but everyone kind of kept to themselves and were in tents by 8. Guess the heat and rain are getting to everyone!","Clarks Ferry Shelter

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596782,"I kept my fly off again overnight, trying to get some airflow. Well, it stayed dry but cooled off a ton and I woke up freezing. I was the last one out around 8. I even had to keep my beanie on for the first few miles, good thing I didn’t send it home!
The morning was pretty easy until I passed Rausch Gap and Stony Creek. I guess beavers made a dam that flooded the trail about four inches deep, and there was no walkaround for half a mile. This wasn’t like clear river walking but muddy, branches, swampy etc. For some stupid reason (laziness?) I decided to keep my shoes on instead of wading in my sandals. Well, it wasn’t hot enough for my shoes and socks to dry out and they kept rubbing against my foot. I didn’t have my toe liners in either, which I usually do for rain.
So that was awesome. At least the sun was out and weather was great. When we got to the next creek before PA 433, I filled up water and was debating taking lunch even though it was early to dry out my feet. It had a weird tree bridge to cross, so I decided to figure that out (my balance isn’t the best) and then reevaluate. When I had gotten over, a guy comes running up and said they had trail magic so don’t eat lunch yet. I guess Crawdaddy and Smiles, a real nice father/daughter duo I was leapfrogging, had told them I was behind and they hadn’t seen me come through yet.
We get to the parking lot and there is a tent and grill set up with quite a spread - burgers, fruit, veggies, homemade cookies, cake, etc. It was put in by. a young couple that thru hiked last year. I think her name was Switchback and his was Trail Name. They had each of their parents there, plus some other locals. They knew exactly what we were craving and were so nice. I think I must have sat there for two hours and don’t even want to think about how much I ate. They even let me take some to go!
Putting my shoes back on was not fun, nor was getting back on the trail. I realized a bunch of bumps on my leg I had noticed earlier now burned like fire. I especially could feel in my knees and feet, so you know nothing important. I don’t think it’s poison ivy because I had a rash on my arm that I think was poison ivy and it looked completely different. At first I thought it was bug bites but who knows.
It’s funny because I had just listened to the Sounds of the Trail episode on pain/injuries, and they talked about how you need to decide if it’s something you can push through or need to re-evaluate. This was definitely the former. I was thinking how apart from blisters and an overused right tendon pain that went away, I have been pretty lucky. Most of my issues have actually been from falling, and I have been very impressed with how my body has handled basically breaking it down everyday. I have been trying to listen to it, and I think elevating my feet whenever possible has helped too.
I hope I don’t sound too whiny or complaining, but wanted to give the other aspect to the romantic parts of thru hiking like beautiful sunsets and meeting cool people. I think the other day I talked about days that are mentally tough, others are physically so. I guess the trick is to make sure they don’t happen on the same day!
So anyway, I finally got service and was communicating with my sister about meeting up since she was in the area. We finally decided on the second shelter I was thinking about staying at, which is actually right by the highway. The only issue was I still had over ten miles to go.
I pushed ahead, the trail was pretty flat following the ridge but a bunch of those pointy rocks Pennsylvania is known for. And it wouldn’t have been so bad, but every time my foot flexed or extended, I could feel the burn. As did any time I hit my knees with my poles, which happened more than you might think.
Well, there must have been magic in the air because TWO different day hikers offered me fruit. I had to humbly decline given the extra food I was already carrying plus my upcoming dinner, but it was definitely tough to say no!
The 501 “Shelter” is well known, as it is more of a cabin/hostel. Totally enclosed with bunks, trash can, portajohns, solar shower, and potable water. It has a caretaker that lives next door, I think the main reason is to ensure only backpackers use it and not local teenagers. I was a little worried about noise with the shelter being so close to the road, but it was on a short blue blaze from the parking lot and there were enough trees to block.
I had just started setting up my tent when the Cohens arrived. They said they would meet me at the shelter, I forgot it wasn’t really well marked so they missed the blue blaze and actually hiked a while on the AT! I guess I have developed a sense of where things are/ trails normally go (not that I don’t get lost a lot, especially in towns).
My sister and her husband have two young boys, and seemed to love being outside and the tent. They even got to give trail magic by passing out Gatorades. Also brought dinner and next day’s breakfast, which was my only awesome to get fresh food but also meant I could delay my resupply.

I got to sleep later than usual last night, woke up at the normal time but kept going back to sleep until 8:30!
My legs didn’t feel horrible, the weather nice so I took slow and got out around 11. I made the executive decision to wear sandals to reduce some of the friction even though the terrain was full of mud and sharp pointy rocks. Baaad idea, my feet got torn up!
Since I had a big late breakfast, was going to skip lunch. However, around 3 I hit a sign right before PA183 saying “Trail magic ahead by Hawk Woman”. Sometimes there are old signs up, so I didn’t get my hopes up. Hawk Woman is an older lady that through hiked in 2016 so knew exactly what we wanted! Burgers, veggies, chocolate milk, etc. Similar to yesterday, she had her family and friends there and it was super chill. I stayed there a while, and when I got to the actual road there were coolers with food and a woman with “Trail Angel” license plate! Not sure what it is about central PA, but there has been a bunch of trail magic!
The afternoon was a lot tougher than the morning. I guess the heat or distance got to my legs and they started killing me. The bumps had developed into pus-filled blisters, even under my shorts, and felt like on fire. I could feel the skin on my knees rubbing against itself every step. Plus I kept stubbing my toes on rocks and bleeding. I probably was going less than two miles an hour.
Unfortunately the shelter was 0.3 miles off trail, but I was thinking it would still be easier than going on to a campsite without amenities so I stopped there. The spring was on the way, I stopped and tried to wash off all the dirt and blood but it was so caked on. I debated staying in the shelter since no one else was, but it was kind of dark and weird so just set up my tent right next to it.
Even though I had eaten so much I didn’t need dinner, I didn’t get done with all my chores until after dark. Mawga showed up and set his tent in the shelter, I was a little annoyed since I thought I would have privacy but it was nice because he had extra hydrocortisone cream he gave me.

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596785,"Even though it was a late night again, today I woke up normal time and was one of the first ones out. The morning was flat but rocky. But it wasn’t as bad as yesterday and I felt okay, so still made pretty good time. My legs were still pretty beat up though so I needed urgent care. Was even thinking about the injury podcast and was so happy that I haven't had anything that has delayed me yet, but oh well it was bound to happen!
The descent into Port Clinton was super steep and loose gravel. At the bottom was a sign if you need a ride anywhere call Eddie, which was perfect because the urgent care would have been a hitch. I called and he was there in 15 minutes.
I was the only patient at urgent care (should have been a sign) and it went pretty quickly. I saw a PA who was not super confident what it was. She called in her colleague (not sure his credentials) and he confirmed didn't know the agent, but ""unspecified contact dermatitis"". So basically I touched some plant (they don't think poison ivy) that caused an allergic reaction in my skin, then either blistered or being in the sun caused heat blisters before it. They didn't like giving steroid shots, so gave me prescription for Prednesone and suggested anti-histamines (i.e. Benadryl). Overall they didn't seem real confident in the diagnosis, which kind of worried me but I guess it is tough to know exactly what happened. They didn't see any signs of cellulitis (when a cut gets infected and spreads blisters).The Walmart was basically next door, although since it was kind of an interstate exit everywhere I had to walk around fences, parking lots, etc. so ended up being closer to 15 minute walk. It also went pretty quickly, I would have done a resupply but didn't need anything! That's why I was hoping to skip Hamburg in the first place.Right by the Walmart was an AYCE Chinese Buffet. Apparently Benadryl makes you hungry, but I didn't need any help with that! I actually was good and ate a lot, but not enough to fill sick. They didn't have a huge salad bar, but my favorite dish was actually the pizza! Next door as the crow flies but still a bit of a walk was a Cabela's. It is more of a hunting store, but listed in the guides and supposed to be hiker friendly. They even will shuttle hikers from the trail to the store. I didn't see anything I really needed but of course good people watching.The hotel was across the street, but also a bit tough to walk to. Their hiker rate was $90, which is a little more than I felt it should have been but didn't really have options. It wasn't a bad place, but I would have put it in more of the $50-$60 dollar range. But it had beds, showers, continental breakfast, and laundry so was worth it.There was a sports bar, Pappy's, attached, so I stopped by for dinner (hiker hunger still real, even with short days!). I actually sat next to another hiker and a guy that worked for Cabela's. He was asking us about what kind of things we think they should stock - they are trying to be hiker friendly. May even become a mail drop. I didn't realize Bass Pro Shops recently bought them out, so I think things settle down they will have some freedom to step outside the corporate mandates and personalize the store. A few minutes later, a big group including Treehugger, Santiago, Crawdaddy, Smiles, and some others came in and invited me over to their table. I kind of hung out, but didn't want to stay a while so I could be back to my room for Jeopardy. They asked the waitress if she could put it on, but they couldn't hook the sound up and I wanted quiet while I watched because I am serious about it. Two of the hikers were nurses and were surprised that they urgent care didn't give me a shot or a Pred Taper (basically take a lot at once to shut down the system, then lower dosage later on). But I told them the dosage of what I had and they thought it might be enough, just wouldn't be as quickly as with the taper.After Jeopardy, I was too tired to go back to the bar so just rested in bed. Felt great, and hopefully the medicine will work quickly and these blisters will pop!","Eagles Nest Shelter

I had planned on doing 24 to a shelter, which didn’t seem like that much and the terrain was flat. What I didn’t expect were the rocks. Yes, it’s not been great since Duncannon, but today was probably 80% climbing over boulders and sharp pointy rocks angled badly. A lot were still wet from yesterday’s rain (and today’s humidity isn’t helping) which made the smooth ones tricky. It all culminated in Knife’s Edge, a quarter mile scramble only a few jagged rocks wide with decent views.
Another issue was that there isn’t a lot of water in this section. I basically had to go 7 or 24 miles. Someone did put a few jugs at a road crossing which was nice.
A further complication for me was this is the first day I’ve really felt chafing in my inner thigh. I know it’s a common thing, but somehow I’ve been spared so don’t carry body glide, etc.
All these factors resulted in my hobbling into camp after seven, meaning I averaged less than 2 miles an hour. And I took a short lunch! I was sore, dehydrated, and hungry so wasn’t thinking straight. I probably should have just set up in the shelter, but it was crowded. I think there were sites down the hill, but I was lazy so set up my tent in a less than ideal spot.

The first mile was basically down to a road junction to Palmerton, Slatington, and Walnutport. After crossing the Lehigh River, the trail ascended steeply up Blue Mountain. I’m talking hand over hand scrambling and rock climbing. It was tough (especially with the extra water weight) but fun and much more enjoyable than the rock walking of yesterday.

Once on the ridge, the trail leveled and was pretty easy with good views of Palmerton. Interestingly, it was actually a Superfund site they turned into a nature preserve, the only the country.

At the Mashipacong Shelter, a trail angel had left water in the bear box, but what caught my attention were signs for magic ahead. At the Deckertown Turnpike was an awesome setup with tons of fresh food, plus spices and condiments packets to go. I probably stayed there at least an hour. 
Up ahead was the office for High Point State Park. In addition to bathrooms, they offer a free soda to thru hikers.   Plus someone had left yogurts and chocolate milk! So stayed there a bit, plus realized I had left my water bottle a quarter  mile back so that took time.

I probably did faster than three miles an hour. Around the Walkill Refuge were a bunch of runners and birdwatchers, but the trail was flat and wide so not an issue.
I had a quick lunch atop Pochuck Mountain after a short but tough climb. A few miles later, crossed County Road 517 with about 20 cars parked there. The trail followed the Pochuck boardwalk which I guess is popular because it’s flat, but not a lot of good views. I didn’t even think about it being a weekend, but was weird being around so many day hikers. And being on a boardwalk for a mile!
At the end was NJ 94 and another big parking lot. But in the lot was Mitch’s hot dog stand, so I went up. I hear the guy go, “Hey, Rabbi!” Guess his Jewdar was up. We talked for a bit (him in Yiddish and me having no idea what he was saying), and I ate the food as I crossed the street to Heaven Hill Farms, which has a small market and bakery. So many fruit and vegetables I was overwhelmed! I ended up spending a lot, including buying a pie that was half off. Luckily there was another hiker there who could help me eat it (we couldn’t finish). 
I realize the shoe store was actually closer from this road, so try to hitch. After a few minutes, the hot dog stand guy (I’m assuming Mitch), called me over and asked me if I had a driver’s license. After I replied in the affirmative, he handed me over his keys!
It was weird driving a car again for the first time in months, but made it work. The shoe store was kind of a hole in the wall in a strip mall, and really only sold trail shoes so I’m surprised can stay in business. I just got the same pair as the other two, why fix it if not broken? But these are blue not green. I still felt a little friction in my ankles, but I’m assuming that is just because they are still tender from yesterday. They did have a thru hiker discount, which was nice.
I saw the shelter was only a few miles away, so figured I had plenty of time before the expected rain. What I didn’t realize is this section is called “stairway to heaven” and involves a lot of tough climbing. A lot of day hikers were coming down, which made it complicated because the trail wasn’t very wide in a lot of sections. I will be glad to be back to less popular sections soon!
At the next road crossing, someone had left a cooler full of sodas which was nice. A bit after that, I passed a day hiker who said that there was a bear a bit ahead. I didn’t think much of it, but did try to keep my eyes open. Sure enough, I passed a large bear on a log probably just 20 feet from the trail. It watched me so I tried not to make eye contact and it didn’t follow. I think later I heard it was a mama with two cubs. Jersey is supposed to have a lot of bears so it’s not a surprise, first (and only) I’ve seen since Shenandoah.
I got to the shelter before 7, plenty of time to set up my tent before the rain. And who is there but Bill, who I haven’t seen since Hamburg, and Mademoiselle who I haven’t seen since the Shennies! Was great catching up, and was still able to retire to my tent tent just as the rain started!","High Point Shelter

I got up at 6 and it was still sprinkling/wind blowing drops off trees, so I tried to eat and get ready in my tent. A couple of guys had come by and brought coffee and donuts which was awesome.
I got out around 8 but stopped right away at the bathroom/spigot at the park office so got an even later start.
Even though the trees blocked most of the rain, the rocks were smooth and slippery. Anytime they were covered with lichen and pointed downward I fell. No matter how slow I took it, probably 6 or 8 times. I think body parts hurt I didn’t even know I had! The worst was I tweaked my knee, so hopefully that doesn’t become an issue. And I bent one of my trekking poles. Leki has good customer service, but I have to get to an outfitter which there are none for a while.
I officially crossed the line into New York. The trail had been skirting the border, but I am totally out of New Jersey. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would, lots of lakes and views! Hopefully NY is as good, not a great start though...
The skies finally cleared and there were some good views of Greenwood Lake and the mountains around it. I decided to take a short trail to a viewpoint, but didn’t feel like coming back on it so tried to bushwhack to the AT. As you can imagine, this didn’t go so well and I fell a few more times.
I finally reached Route 17A, which is notable because there is a hot dog stand and creamery right down the road. I thought it was like 0.2 miles and was feeling lazy, so asked a guy that just got to his car to take me. He accepted, but asked “You can’t walk?” I don’t think he meant in a mean way, but was funny. I was like “I try to avoid any non trail miles if I can!”
The ice cream place was hopping and there werea couple other hikers already there. I got to eat lunch at a picnic table with decent views. Almost everyone from the shelter shortly showed up and we had a big group (us hiker trash kept away from the real people of course). Everyone was either going to a close town or only doing a few more miles. I had originally planned to do 22 or 26 miles, but the terrain threw that plan out the window. I decided to hang around and just go to the shelter a couple miles away- basically a nearo!
I talked a lot with a guy from Austria named Halfway. We joked he was my other half! A guy stopped by with oranges and Gatorade, which was nice. The rain kind of came and went so we decided to get a move on.
It was a short easy walk to the shelter, but my knee started hurting so I’m glad I didn’t go any further. When I arrived, Bill and Blue Moon were there, plus a southbounder (started in Maine going south to Georgia. He is the first I have met and apparently one of the first this year - started May 27th or something. Guess I’m going to see more.
It was nice not having to set up a tent, especially since the rain started again. We all sat around making dinner and talking about parts of the trail we have already done/what the other direction can expect. 
I went to use the privy, and when I came back another person arrived. There was definitely space, but kind of annoying because it was perfect with three people and now it would be crammed. Wouldn’t make him sleep out in the rain though!I think this is actually the first shelter I’ve slept in since Shenandoah.

The first couple of hours were super easy including walking up a waterfalls and I was thinking it would be no problem to pull a big day. Well, that ended with what the guide warns, “Despite the unimposing profile, abrupt ups and downs make this section challenging.” It was like other states would be like “oh, we need the trail to get to the top? Let’s wind around and use switchbacks” but New York was like “Nope, going straight up the middle!” The rain didn’t help either. One nice thing is a local group stashed waters at each of the road crossings. Not that the creeks were dry with all the rain, but it was nice not having to filter.
It got a lot easier once the trail entered Harriman State Park. Well, by easier it was normal ascents and descents. It was actually a pretty area with a lake, open views, etc. The weather was super finicky- basically every hour would pour for twenty minutes, then clear up and sun would come out.
Even though overall the terrain was easier, there was a section called Lemon Squeezer that was a narrow opening between two boulders. I was stubborn and didn’t take off my pack, which was a mistake because it made me slower and the mosquitoes and rain got me.
A few more miles in, someone had left a note warning about a bee/wasp nest. I didn’t see anything for a while so forgot about it, but about an hour later I felt a sting on my knee. It’s always something!
I finally got to the shelter and Rogue Cartographer was there with his family. I haven’t seen him since southern Virginia so we caught up a bit, then they left for the next shelter. That had been my original plan, but was too beat up to push on. The only cool thing is you can see the NYC skyline from there, but I’m guessing not in this rain anyway. There was no privy or box but the shelter was nice and stone with bunks. Unfortunately there was no broom and was really dirty - even hiker trash have standards!Slowly everyone arrived running in from the rain - Zephyr, Blue Moon, TBD with his friend, and Mademoiselle.

Everyone was pretty lethargic with another day of crappy weather, and I was the one of the first out around 8.There were three mountains to cross in the morning - Black, West, and Bear. But the trail actually switch backed or went around the sides so it wasn’t too bad. The weather was switching between rain and sun. And there were all types of fruit - blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and even some crabapples.At the top of Bear Mountain was a vending machine (which was awesome because there had been limited water sources and I was out), port a johns, and a cool tower. You were supposed to be able to see New York City, but it was too foggy. The wind was pretty crazy up there. On the way down, it was like the trail was just recently redone with nice steps and gravel tread. There were some informational signs about trail work which were interesting, I think we take for granted things like retaining walls, etc.At the base of Bear Mountain was Hessian Lake and a big recreational area. But for me the best was a cafe with WiFi! I must have stayed there a few hours and still didn’t get much done. The only thing that sucked was it actually got nice out - didn’t rain all afternoon but I was inside.The trail then actually went through a zoo. It was interesting and I didn’t know what to expect, as it was free you could just walk right in. I had some concerns about seeing animals in cages after being so open in the woods, but I think signs explained well the reasons and how they were doing in a humane way. Apparently right in front of the bear cage was the lowest point on the AT.The trail then crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson River. It was super windy, and probably pretty views but I was focused on staying upright!I still had to resupply so decided to push it. Probably not he best idea right there as it was a steep 500 foot climb up Anthony’s Nose. Luckily it leveled out after that and I made good time.Unfortunately, I realized I left my headphones at the cafe so couldn’t listen to podcasts. I haven’t had my phone out in the bad weather, but since it was actually sunny for a few hours...The Appalachian Market is a gas station/convenience store right on the trail that has a deli and supposedly good resupply. I wasn’t impressed- I think the gas station in Delaware Water Gap had a better selection and prices. I wasn’t really sure how many days to get/where I will resupply next which made it difficult too. Unfortunately they didn’t have headphones or tortillas, and the ziplock bags were twist tie which is not as good protection from rain.There wasn’t a close shelter, but everyone stays at a spiritual center just down the road close to the market. There is a ball field can camp in, spigot, portajohns, and a small pavilion.

I was feeling pretty good and making decent time.I had heard that the Canopus Lake beach was right off the trail and had water, bathrooms, etc. Well, it was about 0.3 away on a tough trail. Sunrise and a couple other hikers were there when I arrived, but apparently the water wasn’t on (also meaning no flushing toilet). The concession was closed with the weather, and a lot of it was under construction getting renovated. I called the park and whoever answered was surprised and said she would send someone.

So of course I had to rush over and get a burger!The nursery was awesome- charging stations, water, and outdoor shower. And they let me hang my gear to dry.

What I didn’t think about was the fact that we would need to pull it down in the morning. With the PCT method, you have to pull down the line to get out the holding stick. This is not normally hard to do, but when there are three bags on it takes a bunch of muscle. Everyone was still asleep, so it took me about fifteen minutes to get it down!I got on the trail around 7:15 and didn’t feel too bad considering the lack of sleep. The weather wasn’t bad, and I shortly crossed into the border with Connecticut (“Gateway to New England” - aka we are near cool states!”)After following the Ten Mile River, the trail climbed sharply uphill a few times. This wore me out, and I was feeling it as I got to a shelter for lunch. I was thinking about taking a nap, but figured it would be best just to go on.As soon as I had packed everything up and was ready to head out, the skies darkened and I heard a bunch of thunder.

It was only a quarter mile walk to Route 341, which led to Kent. Originally I was going to skip it, but with yesterday’s change in plans I needed to resupply.
There weren’t any cars out so early, so I walked the mile into town. Kent was very cutesy with a bunch of boutiques and cafes. Of course the latter was more interesting to me, and I did a crawl similar to Harpers Ferry. They even had a farmers market, but there were only two booths - worse than Marion!
After taking care of resupply and errands, I got back to the trail around noon. The first few miles were easy, then I got to the section I was worried about doing in the rain yesterday- Caleb’s Peak and St. John’s Rocks. They weren’t horrible, but definitely would have sucked doing in the rain. Luckily the sun was out and it was dry - didn’t fall once!
The next few miles were on a gravel road along the Housatonic River so were completely flat and smooth. I don’t remember a section like that since the Creeper Trail our of Damascus!
Some dark clouds and thunder started rolling in. I stopped by a shelter where some overnighters were quickly setting up camp to escape the rain, but I was like nope can’t do this again!
The trail started climbing back  up the mountains, and just then the rain came. It wasn’t a complete downpour and the thunder bypassed, so not bad! I guess I have low expectations now, okay with getting wet. Actually, one of the challenges I wanted to work on by hiking the AT is being better in inclement weather. Of course, no one likes being caught in the rain, but so often at home if it was raining I would just stay inside.
The only issue was the rocks were wet, making the downhills harder. I just went slower, resulting in a few less miles than I wanted.
When I got to the campsite, there were a bunch of people there including Sunrise and Mademoiselle. That’s what happens when you do shorter days, people catch up! Also there were some overnighters, I forgot it was the weekend but they weren’t loud and went to bed before I did.
You are technically not allowed to camp anywhere not official in Connecticut, so they have nice campsites with water sources, privies, and bear boxes. Well this privy had no roof so was basically just a hole in the ground, but at least I didn’t have to dig!

I took a long lunch at the Great Falls, then realized there were a couple of further options past the shelter I was planning so could put in more miles.

It was a smaller, older shelter but still a couple of spots left so I decided to stay.Slowly it filled up with a mix of NOBOs, SOBOs, and Long Trail sectioners. It was a packed house, but everyone was pretty cool. The rain finally let up around 8, but by then it was getting dark.Oh and today I think I hit the 1600 mile mark too!","Mark Noepel Shelter

Gotta love these small bubbles.The morning was foggy and a little drizzly, but not too bad. The trail was torn up though. Vermont is already known for being muddy, and the copious amount of rain the last few days hasn’t helped. Not sure if it’s due to money/people or philosophical reason, but there are no water bars/drainage so the water just pools on the trail (or follows it down slopes). Must have been at least ten times my feet were covered in quicksand mud. And creek crossing were actually nice because you could wash the mud off!I had early lunch at the shelter I was planning on yesterday, a nice guy from Philly who is sectioning the Long Trail joined me and ended up staying an hour. As I was leaving, it started pouring but only lasted five minutes. When I passed Harmon Hill, there were a bunch of blackberries and raspberries. I have been excited for the New England blueberries, not sure where they are?As I was coming down to Route 9, the sun was actually starting to come out. I was really hoping for some trail magic as I’m needing to stretch out my food a little longer than planned with the shorter miles, but no dice.The rest of the afternoon was actually sunny, it was a nice change. Unfortunately there were no views though, hopefully I’ll get one at some point! There was a sign about a bridge being out, but I was able to ford the creek as it was only up to my knees.Even though it was supposed to be clear all evening, suddenly the skies darkened and I heard thunder and felt a few drops. After some cursing, I threw on my rain gear and started booking it to the shelter. I had planned on getting there early (well I had originally planned on a bigger day but that went out the window) but I didn’t get in until after 7. I quickly looked for tent spot but couldn’t find any - all were sloped or flooded. Ping was sleeping in the shelter, well kind of in front of it and convinced me to. I was disappointed because it’s felt like so long since I tented and really wanted my own space but the rain was picking up so I relented.

Oh well!The trail was in a little better shape than yesterday, but not by much. I did take a nasty tumble on a wet boulder that was stupid. It was right into a big mud puddle so my whole left side was dirty/bloody. Luckily I could wash off in one of the 300 water flows running down the trail.I got to a shelter where Ping was having lunch and drying out in the sun. People had talked about trail magic at the upcoming road, but I didn’t believe it so ate what little I had (can’t wait for a real resupply!). Stayed there only about half hour because I was curious what was ahead.Well, at the road crossing was indeed magic with burgers, beer, snacks, etc. It was put on by a trail family that hiked last year so they also had things that were useful- ziplock bags, mayo packets, etc. Amd who is sitting there there but Ball Flap, who I haven’t seen since Virginia! I actually was listening to a podcast today that interviewed him when he did the PCT, strange coincidence!I stayed there about an hour, wish it was longer but still had a bunch of miles to cover. A bit ahead was Mount Stratton, which wasn’t steep but a long climb up (over 3 miles). At the top was a fire tower with good views, amazing what you can see when it’s not raining!I booked it the rest of the way as quickly as I could. Unfortunately, I realized I left my water filter either at the shelter or road so couldn’t fill up any more and got a bit dehydrated. Luckily there is an outfitter in town tomorrow. There were some decent camping sites I passed, but really wanted to make the view. The last mile was actually gravel road and I could see the sun starting to set, so I started running.I ended up getting to Prospect Rock with plenty of time and I see another tent there. It ended up being Ball Flap, and he was glad somebody came. Ping and I had talked about cowboy camping (just setting up sleeping bag, no tent) and since it wasn’t cold or buggy, decided to get a night full of stars!

Since I didn’t have a filter, I decided to boil water for oatmeal so it was nice having a warm breakfast, even though it wasn’t that cold out.
I got out a little before 7, just after Ball Flap. It was pretty easy five miles to the road, and the mud puddles are definitely starting to dry.
When I got to the road crossing to Manchester, there was a guy dropping off his girlfriend back on the trail and offered to take me into town, perfect timing! There were a few other hikers around so he took us to the grocery store. After a crappy gas station resupply last time, I went a little crazy and got way to much food, only need for 2.5 days. 
I walked around town, which was interesting - yes another ritzy ski town, but this one had a bunch of outlet stores. They also had a really good outfitter, the best I’ve seen since at least Virginia. They will replace Darn Tough socks, and I got a new filter and some other small things I needed.
I then walked over to the library to update blog, Ping joined shortly later and had done 12 miles to catch up. We realized the campsite we were going to was only 3 out of town, not 8. I wanted to put in more miles, but the site was supposed to have good views and I figured with not getting sleep no reason to push it.
I stopped by a well known burrito place, but got to go and ate it in a park with my tortillas to lose some pack weight.
On the way out, there was a Ben and Jerry’s. It was ok, but not the original or anything and kind of overpriced. I talked to a couple of hikers there, and since one was female I latched on to them to increase chances for hitching. After a few minutes, a guy in a van calls us over. Turns out he was the owner of the Green Mountain House, a hostel that I was thinking of staying at but want to sleep outside tonight. He was super nice and took us back to the trail even though we didn’t stay there. I wish he had tenting, I would have been so in!
The climb up Bromley Mountain was a little rough with the heavy pack. I also had to carry extra water since there was none on top. But I just took it slowly and it wasn’t bad.
It was still pretty early when I got to the summit, which has a ski lift and warming cabin can sleep in. A few of us were debating going on, but were lazy and didn’t sound like anything good ahead so we just hung out and enjoyed the views. There were a bunch of flat grassy spots which was nice, but so windy I couldn’t really stake my tent out the best. I had packed out some veggies so it was great to add to ramen!

The morning was pretty easy terrain and the mud was finally drying out. There were even a couple of views, unfortunately none coordinated with lunch.
A bit later the skies darkened and a storm came through. Two days without rain, of course it was coming! And the trail got super bad again, plus was a bit rocky and steep. So my pace slowed down a lot. I was hoping for a shelter 26 miles in, but had to stop at 21 as I was running too late for that one and didn’t want to stealth in the rain. Of course this shelter was a third of a mile off trail.
When I arrived there were a few Long Trail hikers inside, but lots of space. The rain had lightened and I found some good tent sites, but figured the  rain could come back and sheltering could get me an earlier start in the morning.

Had a big day ahead as I had to get to a road in 25 miles by 6pm to meet my friend Heather. The morning was foggy but dry. There were a few steep climbs but nothing horrible and I was making decent time.
After lunch the sun came out (despite an original forecast of rain - not complaining!) but there were a few big climbs, including Killington Peak which is the second highest mountain in Vermont. I’m used to climbing hundreds of feet, not thousands! Apparently there was a side trail to a good view, I must have missed it but wouldn’t have had time anyway.
About a mile before the road I hear my name and Heather had hiked out to catch me. We walked back together, and about 100 feet from the car it started raining. It was sooo nice to be able to go in the car and not be on the trail, even if it was over quickly.
We drove to the Yellow Deli, which is a restaurant and hostel owned by the Twelve Tribes, which is kind of a cult. When I went to the counter to check in, before talking about anything else the guy handed me tea. He apparently used to live in Germany but left because “you are not allowed to homeschool or spank your kids”. Apparently the German government also placed some of the children in foster homes.  He was a bit of a slow stoner, so his tour took forever. Overall the place was pretty clean (the members help out) and was packed with hikers - probably 30 or 40. It is all donation based, plus you get a discount at the restaurant and free breakfast.
Heather and I spent a while deciding on where to eat and ended back at the deli (not used to making decisions with someone else!). The food was really good and we were so tired just sat for a while. I’m glad we were able to meet and she hooked me up!

It was all delicious, and they even offered seconds. I sat with Smiles and Crawdaddy who I hadn’t seen since my medical issue in PA and a couple from Raleigh.After cleaning up, I walked just a couple blocks around the downtown to a food coop and then the grocery store. I then walked another block to the bus station, where it would take me right to the trailhead.

Haven’t seen him since Tennessee. Long story short he is section hiking right now up to Maine and will finish the rest at some point. It was nice catching up.We were both trying to book it to a cool camp spot as it was starting to get late, but as we approached a gravel road I see a lot of colors - trail magic!

But once a year they come down and set up a day of magic and it was today! They had an interesting spread - jambalaya, maple syrup packets (apparently good energy source), local beer, and a box of Darn Tough socks the company sent. Ball Flap and Jukebox were there and it was really chill, stayed there a little longer than we wanted!Eventually we got out and booked it up the hill to The Lookout, which is a privately owned cabin available for hikers.

When I got to the Main Street the post office wasn’t open yet. I went to the general store where they sometimes have leftover day old sandwiches for hikers. The worker went in the back and thought they had some, but couldn’t find them. He did offer me a turkey dinner,  but didn’t feel right at 9 in the morning!
I stopped by the post office where my mom had sent cold weather gear I haven’t used since the beginning. Even though it was 80s the other day, it’s starting to cool off and I’m getting to the Whites so I think good timing. But it is going to add a couple pounds and bulk to my bag!
The trail then follows the road over the Connecticut River to Hanover, New Hampshire. I must have missed the border sign because suddenly I was in Hanover! Only 2 states left now, but they are probably the hardest (but most scenic).
The trail goes right through the campus of Dartmouth University. In fact, their outdoor club has a “hiker lounge” (wasn’t great though) and manages the trail for a bit.
Hanover had your typical college town businesses- logo’ed apparel stores, bars, small ethnic restaurants. One of the cafes actually gives a free muffin to hikers, and the pizza place gives a free slice.
After visiting the “outfitter” (really just a North Face store) and the library, I continued on the trail. I see someone across the street who looks familiar, and it’s Misty who I haven’t seen since Harpers Ferry! The third reunion in a week! In fact, I ran into Conor and Ball Flap again at the coop grocery which was one of the fanciest resupply yet.
After passing by the college baseball field which allows tenting, the trail went back in the woods. It looked like there were some steep climbs, but I made decent time especially with the heavy load. The skies got dark and cold and the wind picked up, but it only sprinkled.
I got to the shelter in plenty of time and set up my tent in a spot that will suck if it rains so hoping for a dry night. I walked up to the shelter where they had a big fire going, it was weird because usually people keep them so small.

Basically, I was going down the elevation I ascended yesterday but in a third the miles. There were many sections that had iron rungs or rope to hold on. At least it was pretty following the cascading brook.It took over an hour to cover the mile down to the road. Once there, my plan was to hitch to Lincoln for a resupply. However, there weren’t many cars going by. Another hiker arrived and finally we got a ride by a 16 year old. He said he could drop us off at the first stoplight and we’d have to walk to the store, by which I thought he meant Lincoln.But there was a smaller town before, North Woodstock, that he dropped us at. It was a mile walk to Price Chopper, the other guy went but I decided to go with the closer option. There was a gas station convenience store/market that wasn’t as good as a supermarket but did the job.Then I needed WiFi, and there wasn’t a good coffee shop option so I went to the fancy inn. I was definitely the only hiker trash there, but everyone was nice. All the breakfasts came with juice, coffee, and sticky bun and the server even gave me a few extra oranges. It was nice being inside, and tough to go back in the rain.I figured the hitch back to the trail would be easier as it was right at a stoplight and later in the day, but still no one was biting. Finally a nice old lady stopped. She lived on the other side of the mountain and sounds like she picks up hikers a lot. Even gave me a bag of almonds!It was a steep climb from the road, and having a full resupply didn’t make it easier. Once the terrain leveled off, it was still slow climbing over wet boulders and avoiding mud puddles. But the weather cleared and there were even some pockets of blue. Of course no views here, at some point gotta get the payoff of the Whites!I caught up to Ping who was having a safety meeting and we hiked together the rest of the day.

They are operated by the local club (AMC) and contain bunkhouses that people pay over $100 for and reserve months in advance. Kind of a mix of a traditional AT shelter and a lodge (no heat or running water). Thru hikers can sometimes enjoy free leftovers (guests get breakfast and dinner) and Work For Stay.Even though I didn’t get to the Lonesome Lake Hut until the afternoon, there was still some leftover oatmeal (not sick of it yet!) and some pastries for purchase. Some dark clouds rolled in, so I ended up staying a while talking with a few hikers from the shelter last night - Wilts, Milk Eyes, and Pro. They found an Appalachian Trail board game which was fun to relive some of the towns and joke about experiences.I finally got out, and assumed it was going to be a steep downhill then up to Franconia Ridge. Quite the opposite though, it was a very gradual downhill with minimal scrambling I could actually make regular time on and the uphill had small rocks could easily climb.

I think because of the weather, there weren’t many other people out which was nice.A mile before the peak of Mount Webster were a set of cliffs. When I came out of the woods and looked out on the ledge, it literally took my breath away. Not sure it is the best view, but the angle coming up and looking across Crawford Notch to the Willey Range was amazing. I would have loved to stay longer, but the weather looked threatening and wanted to get to the hut.The rest of the climb up to the top of Mt. Webster was a lot tougher and involved a lot of scrambling, including sometimes completely vertical rock climbing. It then leveled out a bit to the peak of Mount Jackson, which I believe marks the official beginning of the Presidentials.I got to the Mizpah Spring Hut about a quarter to six, which is a couple hours later than ideal. However, even though they already had two Work For Stays they said they could take another. But 6 is dinner time so they told me to hang out a bit.

The rain picked up, so I’m glad I was inside. I cleaned up my stuff and hung around until after breakfast.The couple was originally going to leave early, but since it was storming they didn’t want to summit Mt. Washington and stayed for morning WFS/breakfast. A couple of guys in their group who tented last night joined as well, turns out they are part of a group called Warrior Expeditions that supports veterans on thru hikes.Everyone at at 7am and around 8 they called us in to the kitchen to eat. It was awesome blueberry pancakes, plus oatmeal which tastes so much better when not cold soaked. I probably had about ten pancakes.The chores were easy, just had to sweep the bunk rooms which took about twenty minutes with all of us.They took off, but with the thunderstorms I wasn’t looking to get out anytime soon. It finally started clearing up, so I took off around 11. I heard the initial climb out of the hut up Mt. Pierce was tough, but it wasn’t too much scrambling. Just a lot of mud and wet rocks.The next few miles were all exposed above treeline, going over Mt. Eisenhower, Mt. Franklin, and Mt. Monroe. It is supposed to be a bunch of views from the Presidentials, but it was all fogged in. The wind picked up and might have been in a cloud, but it got super cold and wet. At least the terrain was okay. I did fall hard one time on my hip that hurt the rest of the day.I got to the Lake of the Clouds Hut around 2:30, which was too early for Work For Stay but I didn’t feel like going over Washington so sat down and had some soup. Hot Sauce is another NOBO and had soup too but didn’t stay. I was about to ask about the WFS when Pro, Milk Eyes, and Wilts walked in. They asked about WFS and the croo said too early but could stay in the Dungeon, which is basically a small stone room in the basement that serves as an emergency shelter. There are six bunks crammed in there, super tight and dank. It does cost ten dollars which is kind of annoying but at least out of the weather.I talked to the croo and convinced me to get a dungeon spot too. Ping and Ballflap arrived a bit later hoping for WFS but the croo said still too early. We hung out a bit more but they kept saying no. We finally all went down and it was super crowded and depressing. We all just kept bitching about the croo, etc.We weren’t counting on leftovers but just in case we went up around 7:30. There were like twenty thru hikers there, including ones that got WFS which was kind of annoying because it basically awarded people being slow. I figured there’s no way I’d get leftovers but at least was able to use the hot water for my pasta side. I hung out a few hours, had just brushed my teeth and Ping told me we could get chicken. Oh well.After basically having ten people down and hotboxing the dungeon, everyone ended up sleeping upstairs!","Mizpah Hut

Took some time with hot chocolate in the dining room and got out around 7.While cold and windy, it wasn’t as bad as yesterday so I’m glad I waited. I was wearing all my layers and wasn’t too cold. Plus there were some breaks of sun, I could look back to the lodge and the valley below.It was only a mile and a half to the summit of Mount Washington. But it can have the most dangerous weather, changing at an instant, so I was a bit worried. Plus I assumed it was going to be a steep hike. It was about 1,200 foot gain over a mile, but on nice rock steps so not bad.At the top of Washington is a whole visitors complex since you can drive up or take a train. We were excited because it had bathrooms, outlets, trash cans, and a cafeteria. Plus an ATM which was nice since the huts only take cash. The summit was all fogged in, but I didn’t feel like waiting around for it to clear. Still stayed there a while.The descent down Washington wasn’t too bad either. At one point the trail paralleled the cog railroad tracks and I think people were looking at us like at a zoo.Once the trail leveled off around Mount Clay, the sun came out and it was amazing. Could see back to Washington, ahead to the northern Whites, the valley below, and countless other peaks. And we would be above treeline for most of the day! I didn’t realize how down I was feeling, especially about the Whites, until I felt so great. All that negative complaining in the dungeon yesterday just evaporated, and it made up for Franconia Ridge and around Mizpah.The trail went up and down a little bit around Mounts Jefferson and Adams. It was all barren peaks that involved some boulder hopping and following cairns. Kind of a mix of the rocks of PA with the views of New Hampshire. Edward Shitterhands and her crew were slackpacking and caught up to us as well, and I introduced them to the Ping/Ballflap and Wilts/Pro/Milk Eyes group. Uh oh, I better be careful or we’ll become a tramily.I got to the Madison Hut around 1 and ordered a bowl of soup to go with the sandwich I picked up at the summit. Unfortunately it was super watered down, disappointing since the hut food has all been so good.It was a steep climb from the hut up Mount Madison, but luckily not too long. Once past the summit, I didn’t see very many hikers. But it got pretty tough, descending 3,000 feet to below treeline. There weren’t clear paths/trail, just cairns generally directing and a bunch of boulders. I think it was some of the slowest miles I’ve done on the trail, at least there were views!Once below treeline the trail got more defined and dirt, but still steep downhill. I took a nasty fall that somehow bruised a muscle in my back, which throbbed the rest of the day.After the Osgood Campsite the trail finally leveled off and became walkable at a normal speed. I was thinking about stealthing by one of the river crossings, but didn’t see anything good. I finally took the side trail to Lowes Bald Spot, which was supposed to have some decent views and stealth spots. The views were good looking back up to the Whites, but unfortunately there weren’t great sites for my 2-person tent. I finally settled on a spot on the trail that still ended up not being big enough, but my back hurt I didn’t feel like going back on the AT. I could stake the rainfly doors out all the way, so we’ll see how that goes. Might be a damp, foggy morning.

So much, or because it wasn’t getting enough airflow, that it got on the inside and dripped on some of my gear, including the quilt. I slept in until 6:30 hoping the sun would dry it out, but it was too cloudy and shady. I even spread it out on the rocks to no avail. My back wasn’t much better and with the tight space getting ready was tough and I didn’t get out until 8:30.It was a few easy miles to Pinkham Notch. There is a visitors center with bathrooms, trash, and a cafeteria. Thru hikers get $2 soup, and it was a delicious vegan chili with quinoa. I stayed a bit charging and eating.I talked to a SOBO who said the climb up Wildcat Mountain wasn’t bad. Not sure why I believed him (I typically never trust when anyone says something is easy or hard) because it was a bunch of hand over hand rock climbing straight up. My back was not a fan and I was going pretty slowly. It is actually a set of peaks, and at one there is a ski lift people were taking up from the road. I was debating taking it down to go into town, but pressed on.The rest of the peaks weren’t super tough, but the trail still had some steep scrambles. There was a good view of the Carter Notch Hut and across to Carter Mountain, and then a steep downhill to the hut. I originally planned to go much further, but as it was late afternoon I took my time to see if I could hit up Work For Stay. Apparently they don’t take people until almost dark, but it’s probably for the best so I could put in more miles. I also had thought I had seen storms forecasted, but I looked wrong so figured I could just stealth somewhere. I ate a bunch of baked goods so I didn’t have to worry about cameling up water for dinner.Although the climb up Carter looked difficult, it was all stone steps and no scrambling. The sugar was kicking in and I crushed it, plus my back felt much better. Once at the first peak, the trail leveled out and I was booking it. There was a great 360 degree view on Mt. Hight, but I didn’t love the spot and wanted to go further. I finally got to a large but uneven spot on the saddle between South and Middle Carter Mountains, and since it was getting late decided to set up.

The other peaks of Carter Mountain weren’t bad, but it was a steep descent down to the Imp Campsite. Similarly, the climb up Mt. Moriah wasn’t bad, but the descent was rough. The trail finally leveled out around the Rattle River for the last couple of miles before the road. There were very few rocks, it felt like walking on the sidewalk!
When I got to the road, there was a hostel right there but they were full. I called the other hostel in town and they were full too! I had no idea, I think because you can get here from Pinkham Notch people stay here two nights. The guy at the hostel offered to take me to a motel in town, but was actually shuttling to the Walmart so let me come for resupply. In fact, Edward Shitterhands and the Warrior Expeditions group was going so I caught up with them.
The shuttle dropped me off at a “budget” inn but I didn’t really have options. Milk Eyes and his crew are actually in the room next door. I threw my stuff down and ran to do errands before everything closed. I was able to get to Post Office, Laundromat, Outfitter, and Library in time.
The best part about the motel is that it is next to a Chinese buffet, and I was starved. The food was ok, but it was super small. The one in Hamburg (my only comparison) was three times as many dishes. I ran into Root Ninja and Kuck who ate planning on zeroing tomorrow since it’s supposed to rain all day.

The driver was definitely interesting, gave me a rock with a crystal on it that unfortunately was too heavy for me so I might be cursed.
After a brief road walk, the trail went up Mount Hayes. It was steep, but no scrambling involved so the biggest issue was the rain. It sucked, but I also felt hardcore not taking a zero just because rain.
After Hayes, there weren’t big elevation gains or losses so I figured I could make good time. However, with awkward wet rocks, mud puddles, and downed trees I wasn’t able to go that fast. There was nowhere covered to stop for lunch so I just had a snack and kept plugging away.
The skies cleared in the afternoon to a mix of sun and drizzle. I thought it was supposed to rain all day, if I had known I probably would have left later. But it was good I didn’t since the trail was still pretty tough it would have been an even shorter day.
I got to the shelter turnoff a little after 5 and was thinking about going on since it was nice out, but was feeling pretty beat so at least figured I could check it out. There was a beautiful view from the shelter overlooking the valley and I think back to Carter Mountain. And Ping was there! He had left Gorham in the morning and had been at the shelter since one. He convinced me to stay, and since most of the tent sites were flooded and I was feeling lazy, I decided to shelter it even though it looked like there would be snorers.

A few miles in was the border with Maine. New Hampshire was tough and I’ve heard good things about Maine so super excited! Plus it’s the last state and all.
Right before the Carlo Col Shelter was a super steep downhill section with smooth wet rocks. There was a part that involved jumping down, I guess I missed wherever I was aiming and ended up tumbling face first for about ten feet. It was really scary, but somehow I managed to not get seriously hurt.
Climbing up Goose Eye wasn’t too bad, and near the top there were even metal rungs to hold on. I was like Where are these for the 300 other places that need ‘em? It was nice views but super windy along the ridge, as bad as the Presidentials.
I stopped for a late lunch at a shelter to get out of the wind. Eddie and the Warrior crew showed up shortly later, they had lunched at the top of Goose Eye but it had been too windy. I sat down to eat and when I got up again it was like I had aged 40 years - all my bones were creaking and I was groaning with every movement. I ended up staying a little longer than ideal to rest up for what was next.
After Fulling Mill Mountain (which was a steeper ascent and descent than I would have liked) is the Mahoosuc Notch. This is known as “The hardest mile on the AT” (and for some the most fun) because it is a bunch of climbing around boulders, jumping, crawling, etc. There are a couple places you have to take off your pack to fit through, and it is not well blazed so involves a bit of problem solving.
I was a bit anxious for this part considering I don’t have the most body awareness and I fall so much on regular terrain. So I took it super slow. I started with Eddie and the Warriors and it was nice to folllow their path, but they quickly got ahead and I didn’t want them to wait. Another group who had previously said they were going super slow passed me, so I was officially the slowest. Oh well, I just wanted to finish before dark!
A few minutes in, there was a part to throw your bag over and my water bottles fell in a crevasse. Luckily I was able to save one of them, the other was out of reach.
A little bit later I was trying to balance on a rock and my foot fell in a crevasse. I started freaking out but realized the ground was only a few inches down! Still, my heart skipped a beat and was the second time today my life flashed before my eyes.
I finally made it through in about two hours (yes for 0.8 miles) which I’m guessing is above the average but oh well I survived! Overall I scraped my limbs a few times and probably ripped my bag and a bunch of gear, but made it out relatively unscathed.
A few feet after the hard section I guess I wasn’t paying attention and went to step down on rock, totally missed and fell hard on my knee. It was ironic that I had made it fine through the Notch and got hurt right after!
There was a campsite shortly ahead, and I stopped by to check even though it was only 6 and was thinking about going up to the next shelter. Ping and a couple people were there and since I was pretty beat up and it was a steep climb ahead, I set up camp.

Mahoosuc Arm was a pretty steep climb and there weren’t many stealth spots, so I’m glad I didn’t do it last night. Took me over 2 hours to get to the shelter. Going up Old Speck was a bunch of exposed smooth rock slabs. It wasn’t bad going up, but I’m glad I wasn’t going South- they would have been super scary looking like walking off a cliff!
The descent down from Old Speck wasn’t bad since it was over a few miles. One of the few downhills I’ve been able to go at a decent pace!
At Grafton Notch was a big parking lot with privies and trash cans. I stopped for lunch, and pretty soon a huge group of loud college aged kids showed up, so I got out quickly.
The climb up to Baldplate started gradually and then got steeper. I got a little confused because there was supposed to be a shelter and it took me so long to get to it. But I got out on exposed slabs and realized I was fine on time, must have just missed the turnoff sign. And I haven’t  downloaded the last section of Guthook so I could GPS. I did accidentally put my foot in the bog mud and it went over my sock almost to my knee! Ugh.
The top of Baldplate was actually really nice. There were 360 degree views and the trail followed along long rock slabs kind of like stairs. There was another large group at the top taking photos so I didn’t stay long.
It wasn’t that late yet so I was thinking I could finally do a big day again. But the descent down Baldplate was pretty rough and took me a while. I got to the shelter around 6 where there was another big group. Turns out they are all college orientations, this one was Harvard. I still had a little time and didn’t want to be around the big loud group, but AWOL wasn’t showing anything good for camping for a while and I didn’t have Guthook for stealthing so just set up in a grassy spot up the trail.

I finally got up at 5:30 and was out at 7, they were all still asleep. Unfortunately since I was in tall grass my fly and tent got a little wet and had to pack them separately.
After a short steep uphill, the trail gradually descended for the next four miles. It was pretty nice, few steep slabs. Dunn Falls was awesome and would have been nice to camp at last night, but it took me two hours to get there so would have involved hiking in the dark. I didn’t see any other stealth sites along the way so I think I made the right decision. 
When I got to the road crossing, Ball Flap and Player One were there. They had just been dropped off by the hostel shuttle and were starting their day. They said it was not an easy road to hitch and took them half hour yesterday. A few minutes later, we hear the engine of a big truck coming up the mountain. It was a big dump truck and I stuck my thumb out. Ball Flap was like yeah, right but the guy stopped! I could barely jump up into the cab it was so tall. The road was super bumpy and it was hard for me to hear the driver, but I think he picks up hikers often.
The truck dropped me off in “downtown” Andover. By which I mean the intersection that has the general store/diner, market, restaurant, and bookstore. That is everything, although what more could a hiker need?
I went into the general store and picked up some bars but figured I would do the full resupply next door. When I got to the register, the guy in front paid for me! I then sat down to have a huge breakfast and use WiFi (can’t believe they have). I resupplied next door, I should have just gotten a couple days to get to Rangeley but I tried to get enough for 4+ days to Stratton. So my bag is suuuper full. The market also had a box of free oranges so I stocked up on Vitamin C, and dried out my rainfly in the parking lot.
I went back to the intersection to hitch back out, figuring it would be pretty easy. Half hour later, still no dice and I was in the hot sun. Most people were going in other directions. There was the number for a trail angel in Guthook, but he didn’t answer. About 15 minutes later, a lady outside the bookstore picked me up. I have a feeling she went totally out of her way, as she grew up in the area and was trying to remember the landmarks we passed.
When I got to the trailhead, I was dehydrated from the hitch so hung out by the brook for a while. I finally started the climb up Wyman Mountain, which was nice and gradual. It then followed the ridge a bit until a shelter. It was only 5 and there was another big college orientation there, plus some thru hikers I didn’t love, so pressed on.
It was downhill for the next couple of miles, not too steep though. I’m thinking at lower elevations it is more dirt, roots, and rock steps that I like versus the annoying steep smooth rock slabs at higher elevations.
When I got to Sawyer Brook it was only 6, but there was a nice campsite there with a picnic table and didn’t really make sense to go on. I set up camp, it was actually pretty warm out so kept the fly doors open. I spent a while soaking my feet in the brook, my ankles are a little tender because they are rubbing against the back of my shoe. I’m going to try to duct tape them, but may not last me much longer. I got them about 600 miles ago so was hoping they’d make it all the way, but the rocks and mud of New England had other ideas. Which may mean I’ll need to go into Rangeley after all!

At the bottom at the road was a brook with a campsite with awesome trail magic. Sandwiches, cookies, and campfire roasted breakfast pizza. It was hosted by a guy named Old Buzzard, who thru hiked back in the day and was disappointed that all the trail magic was in the South and none in New England. I hung out a while and they didn’t have anything to drink other than beers, so was an interesting morning.
About an hour later Heather, her boyfriend Alan (who thru hiked a couple years ago) and their dog Dakota pulled up on their way back to Vermont from Maine. They had sodas so we were able to add to the magic.
The four of us hiked up Old Blue Mountain, which wasn’t super steep but definitely not flat. They were troopers and Dakota held her own, especially on some sections that had iron rungs and ladders.
The summit didn’t have great views, but was nice weather and had a big spot to sit. We probably hung out for over an hour, and they had brought delicious local cantaloupe (apparently Vermont has...?). It was nice catching up with Heather and talking to Alan about his hike.
They went back to their car and I continued north. The trail followed the ridge around Bemis Mountain for a while, so it was pretty easy terrain except for some mud bogs.
A couple hours later it started to sprinkle. It was funny because we had just talked about how wet it was this year, but at least this week is nice. I threw my pack cover on, which barely fit since my bag is so full. Luckily it never did more than a heavy sprinkle and never poured. But the rocks were a lot wetter.
There were some great views coming down Bemis Mountain and it wasn’t too steep. I got to the stream with the official campsite, but it was loud and crowded so went on and found a muddier but quieter spot.

It was a climb right away, and about a mile up was a road with a nice  overlook called Height of Land. There were dark clouds and a bit of a chilly wind, but it stayed dry.
The trail basically stayed up on the ridge all day. At Sabbath Day Pond there was supposed to be a nice beach, but it must have been high tide because there was only like 3 inches of sand. A bit chilly to go in anyway.
For lunch I stopped at the Little Swift River Pond, which had a little campsite and a privy. But the coolest thing there was a canoe! I was skeptical to take it out, but a couple of others did and it didn’t take on water.
The afternoon continued on the ridge to ME 4. This is where you can hitch to Rangeley. I pretty much had enough food to make it further, but was considering going in because they have an outfitter. There are a couple of hiking specific items I could use, plus probably a new pair of shoes but decided I could make it last the last couple hundred miles. Who really needs ankles anyway?
There is a hostel a quarter mile down the road, so I walked over to see what they had. Awesomely, the hiker box had packets of oatmeal which is the one thing I was running low on. The trail provides! I bought a cold Gatorade and charged my phone off a solar panel (they are off the grid). The owner chatted for a while, apparently runs a nonprofit providing medical care to children in India.
There was a shelter a few miles later that had a big group (I was hoping the college orientations were over), but I still elevated my feet and used the privy, which is notable in that it has two seats with a cribbage board in between.
I passed an older gentleman walking south that said “Wow, that last mile was the worst trail I’ve ever seen!” He went on for a bit, I didn’t get a chance to clarify his reasoning but kind of arrogantly brushed him off with a “well, I’ve hiked over 1,900 miles so I’m not too concerned!” Sure enough, I didn’t notice anything different about that section and it wasn’t that hard. Why I don’t believe what anyone says about parts being easy/hard/whatever.
I got to Eddy Pond which had a pretty view, but no good campsites on the water. So I went up a bit and found an old path that was smooth and flat to set up. But I was able to go down to the water to cook dinner and watch the sunset.

There was immediately a steep climb up Saddleback Mountain, which is the second tallest mountain in Maine. At the top was supposed to be amazing views including Mount Washington, Katahdin, and the coast but it was foggy and windy of course.
Next was The Horn which wasn’t too crazy of a climb but the descent was super hard, lots of awkward boulders to climb around. Finally was Saddleback Junior, which I did get a few views from.
Then it was another steep downhill to the Poplar Ridge shelter for lunch and to dry out my tent. There were some annoying talkers when I arrived, but they left shortly. I ended up spending over an hour there reading a binder of FAQs that the caretaker put together. He has been there over 50 years, and it had a lot of information. Including that I should have seen a moose by now! And the Maine club philosophically does not believe in foot bridges over creeks.
After a mix of steep and gradual downhill, the trail crossed Orbeton Stream. I was worried because it’s a ford, but luckily the water wasn’t too high so I could rock hop.
The trail then followed the cascading Sluice Brook, which was pretty and also meant a gradual climb. Then it split and got steep to the top of Lone Mountain, which had no views. 
After that was an easy couple of miles to the shelter. I was debating going on as it was only 6, but not many options right ahead and the skies were getting dark.

Shortly after was a plaque about the CCC completing this section which was the last when the AT was finalized in the 1930s. It was a tough downhill off the mountain, with big boulders but got good views of the Carrabassett Valley.
Next was a ford of the Carrabassett river, but I was able to rock hop and didn’t fall in. On the other side, I ate the rest of the peanut butter and tortillas even though it was early to reduce weight for the uphill.
The Crockers looked really intimidating, but ended up being pretty easy and no scrambling involved. It was a nice gradual downhill to the road. When I got there, Ballflap was just getting back on (like Andover). Shortly after a car pulls up, Ballflap said it was the guy from a hostel so I jumped in. A few minutes in, he mentioned it would be 5 bucks. I was kind of annoyed he didn’t say that before I got in, but didn’t want to argue because he was overwhelmed. Well, in hindsight I think always looking to make a quick buck (he was just coming back driving someone to Bangor even though people had been waiting all day to check in).
Anyway, I resupplied at a market and went to a restaurant for food and WiFi. I was able to get a hitch out pretty quickly, I think again by someone who wasn’t even going in that direction. Mainers are so nice!
Even though it had been sunny for the three hours I was inside, dark clouds rolled in and lots of thunder booming. I should have stopped at a stealth spot then, but decided to keep pressing on. My goal was an official campsite I thought was 4 flat miles in, and I figured I could hide in the privy until the system passed.
Well, I think the worst of the storm went over the mountain, but I still got poured on. I passed an official looking campsite, but it hadn’t been more than a couple miles in so I kept going. But then the trail started climbing steeply, which wasn’t supposed to happen. The rain let up a bit, and when I looked in the guide I realized I HAD passed the campsite, I had been looking at the shelter that was halfway up the mountain. At that point it was stupid to turn around, so even though it was late I pushed on and figured I could stop at the next stealth spot.
It got dark enough I needed to bust out the headlamp and start night hiking, my first time doing so on the AT. It wasn’t too bad, more I was just trying to get done and it was tough climbing.
I finally got to the shelter about 8:30, it looked empty but it was a mother/son and I had woken them up. Oh well, people have done that to me a lot. Unfortunately it was a huge spread out complex and it took me like half hour to find the privy, so I got to bed pretty late.

I finally got up at 6 and was slow, getting out at 8 to a cold fog.There were four peaks to Mount Bigelow - North Horn, South Horn, West Peak, and Avery Peak. All were tough up and down but at least there were minimal scrambles. But at least I got amazing views. Haha just kidding of course all fogged in.
Coming down, I see someone coming towards me that looks familiar. It’s Headbanger, who I started with and haven’t seen since Hiawasee! He made it to Front Royal, then had to take time off so he is Flip Flopping back down.
I had lunch on Little Bigelow and actually did have a decent view of Flagstaff Lake. It sprinkled a bit, but not too much.
The afternoon was easy with a couple hills but mostly flat, and some pretty ponds.
The shelter was right near a pond, but unfortunately was blocked by trees and there were no good stealth spots closer. But there were a lot of nice sites further up, and it was a new (handicap accessible) privy. Ballflap had set up in the shelter, so after setting up my tent I cooked dinner with him.","Horns Pond Lean-to

The morning was super easy, and I actually got in 10 (miles) before 10 (am) for the first time in a while. I tried to keep up with Ballflap, but he is too fast.
We got to the Kennebec River about 11:15. This crossing is special because it is too dangerous to ford as there is a dam that randomly releases a bunch of water. So the Maine ATC actually set up a ferry to make it safer. Well by “ferry” I mean canoe with an operator. It even has a blaze on it so purists don’t feel they have to ford. It fits two extra people, so after signing releases and putting on life jackets, Ballflap and I got in. It was a beautiful day and I even got to paddle and work my upper body! In all only took a few minutes but was a nice change of pace.
A half mile after is the “town” of Caratunk, which is really only a few buildings. One is a B&B known for their sandwiches and milkshakes, so of course we had to check it out! I stayed there a while, would loved to have all day but places to be.
The afternoon was generally easy with one big mountain, Pleasant Pond. I was hoping to get some quick miles in but it slowed me down and my feet were killing as my shoes are shot. There was a gravel road by a pond that I figured would have a bunch of stealth spots, but only found one and no view. And there is a house near hear someone is mowing their lawn at 8pm! But I think I’ll sleep well tonight, another big day tomorrow but was nice to get over 25 again!","West Carry Pond Lean-to

The elevation change for the rest of the day was minimal, so I was assuming I could crush it and get to town pretty early. But my shoes were so shot they were rubbing against my ankles, and every root and rock that was not a flat step (so basically every step) was torture. It didn’t help that there were two river fords that weren’t deep, but meant I got my shoes and socks (or what’s left of them) soaked and increased the friction. I didn’t even stop for lunch and it still took me over nine hours to do 20 flat miles.
I finally got to the road and Miss Janet was in the parking lot. I have heard stories about her, she is a trail legend. But she did offer me a Gatorade so all good. I called the hostel and the shuttle came a few minutes later. Shaw’s has been around for a while and most NOBOs and SOBOs stay here as it is right before/after the Hundred Mile Wilderness.
I was lucky I had called to reserve a bed because I got the last one. Unfortunately it is the one that doesn’t have a table or outlet, but I think it will feel pretty nice tonight! And the bunkroom is only 6 and they are REAL beds, not bunks! The whole place is pretty clean, and except for WiFi going down a great place to stay.
By the time I had put my stuff down, the barbecue restaurant in town was closing. Luckily, one of the workers had made coffee cake so I had a couple of pieces of that to hold me over. Would have been nice to eat real food after a day of Cliff bars but breakfast is supposed to be amazing! And hopefully I can hitch to an outfitter to get new shoes.","Moxie Pond Road

At least the WiFi was working nicely since no one else was on! I went to the kitchen around 6 where they had coffee/tea. An hour later was breakfast - eggs made to order, hash browns, and blueberry pancakes. Not sure what the fuss is about, everything was good but not amazing - maybe because they had over 40 people!I finished packing up my stuff and headed over to the gear shop/resupply next door. Everything was overpriced, but it was convenient. The owner had driven a shuttle so I couldn’t cash out, so walked over next door to the general store. The deli wasn’t open yet for sandwiches, and they didn’t have much for resupply. So I went further down the street and found a gas station convenience store that actually would have been a good resupply, but oh well. I stopped by an office set up to help hikers plan for Baxter State Park since the rules are so complicated. We’ll see when I get to Abol Bridge if I can get the option I want!I cashed out at the hostel (after getting new socks and pole tips!) and was talking to them about hitching to Greenville for new shoes when Trout said he would take me. I didn’t recognize him, he was the guy that drove me in Stratton! But it was nice of him to take me, it was about 20 minutes away.We passed the trailhead on the way over and a couple of hikers were trying to get groceries so we picked them up. The outfitter was pretty big and I got the last pair of the shoes I like! We then went back over to the grocery store which actually had another outfitter/sporting goods store attached. If I had known I would be going to the grocery I would have waited! But I did get stuff for lunch.Trout dropped me off at the trailhead, where a couple of girls were giving out cold drinks. I hung out there for a bit eating my lunch, and Player One and Ballflap came down the trail. We hung out for a bit, they went into town and I finally got on the trail almost one.The elevation profile looked pretty easy, so I assumed I could bust out miles especially with new shoes. But there were a bunch of short steep up and downs, plus the rocks and roots slowed me down. I think I counted about 30 feet of actual smooth trail in ten miles.Around 5:30 I got to the Big Wilson Stream. There was a nice campsite on the south side, but since it was early and I figured I wouldn’t want to ford the river in the cold morning, I crossed. It took me a while, as the spot I picked wasn’t ideal and ended up having to go back to shore and finding a better spot. It was a lot easier to change into my sandals with new shoes and socks though!There were a couple of guys who were cameling up for the shelter ahead, and since it was so late I did the same. It was tough because it was uphill with the extra weight. Of course when we got to the shelter, there was a nice spring. Unfortunately, there weren’t great tenting options and I debated staying in the shelter to get an early start tomorrow (and someone said it might rain) but found a rooty, sloped spot I made work.

Except for not having any water, they didn’t look too difficult.I ate a quick lunch at the top of Barren and seemed to be doing okay on time. But somehow I slowed down a bunch on the next few. I got to a shelter around 6 and considering I didn’t see anything good for the next few miles set up camp. After less than 16 miles in over 10 hours! Not sure if it was the terrain (still rocky and rooty), ascents/descents, exhaustion catching up to me or what but I had wanted to go at least a few more miles to a nice pond. It wouldn’t matter, would just be a slow short day but I’m on a timeline to finish. Hopefully I can make up some miles in the next few days, but tomorrow I know are still some mountains (Chairback, Gulf Hagas, and Whitecap).

I finally got up at 5:30, to discover my food bag had fallen in the night and a rodent had chewed a hole in it. Luckily, as far as I could tell it only got a bag of trail mix.I got on the trail at 7 and had to climb the final peak of Chairback. It wasn’t too bad, but the descent was super steep. There was a section that was basically a rock slide that was similar to coming down Mount Madison in the Whites. I got a little turned around and actually had to bushwhack back to the trail.Then was a ford of the Pleasant River. Although it was annoying taking the time to switch my shoes, the water was only shin deep and felt quite refreshing. The trail after that entered Gulf Hagas, and was super nice and smooth until the AT broke off into it’s usual roots and rocks. But at least it was a nice gradual incline.After an early lunch on the brook, I took on the last big mountains for a while. First was Gulf Hagas, which didn’t have too bad of a climb or descent. Then was Whitecap, which actually consisted of West Peak, Hay Mountain, and then Whitecap. The ups and downs weren’t too bad at first, but after a while were exhausting!The view from Whitecap was really nice, and I think the last time I’ll be above 1,600 feet until for a while. Just after the summit was actually a view of Katahdin! So exciting. The descent looked intimidating, but there were a lot of nice steps so I could take it pretty quickly (and not fall).After the shelter it got even nicer and I realized I could actually make up some time so started booking it. Even though still lots of roots and rocks, it felt good!There was still Little Boardman Mountain, which is not so “little” after a long day, but I was able to push it and get to camp before dark.It was a bunch of sites right before a beach on a pond and it was pretty crowded but still spots open. I went down to the beach to cook dinner and another group gave me their leftover Good to Go (fancy awesome dehydrated meal). Saved me time and effort from cooking, worked out really well.

Maybe this is TMI, but for the first time that I can remember maybe the entire trail, I didn’t feel a need to cathole it in the morning.Even though I left under mostly blue skies, about ten minutes later clouds came in and it started pouring. Only lasted about half an hour, but was like a farewell shower from the AT. I did stop to use a privy at a shelter, but that was more out of convenience and proactive than a need.For most of the morning, the trail followed Rainbow Stream then Rainbow Lake. The trail was pretty bad with rocks and roots and some short steep sections, but nothing horrible. I was a bit worried about the climb up Rainbow Ledges, but it was gradual and easier than some of the other parts. Although the view to Katahdin was clouded over, there were tons of blueberries and huckleberries so I enjoyed the local cuisine.The trail down from the ledges was a little steep, but I was still able to go quickly. I was booking it down a hill when I heard rustling in the bushes. Usually it’s just a chipmunk or bird, but I looked over and it was a moose! No antlers, but still a big guy. I had startled it, but it didn’t go very far. I stopped, and when it realized I wasn’t a threat it casually walked across the trail and started eating some grass. I slowly walked by, and on the other side was another hiker who was actually with his dog but it was quiet. Everyone says it is likely to see a moose but I have been looking at every pond to no avail so glad I got on my last full day!The rest of the trail out of the Hundred Mile Wilderness to Abol Bridge was pretty easy and I got in earlier than expected. Here there is a campground, store, and restaurant. And importantly for hikers, a trash can and potable water! I originally was going to quickly pick up a snack and head on, but since it was early I ordered food and sat at a picnic table on the Penobscot River with an awesome view of Katahdin.A half mile later was the entrance to Baxter State Park and the signup sheet for NOBOs wanting to stay at the campsite at the base of Katahdin. I was worried since it was already after 2pm it would be full, but only a few names on so I was relieved. And it looks like 007 summited today, just missed him!The first few miles of trail were amazing - flat, smooth and following the Penobscot. The trail then got a little rootier following Nesowadnehunk Stream, but wasn’t horrible. There were a bunch of cascades, then a couple ponds with good views of the mountain.I got to the campground about 6 and checked in at the ranger station. I am NOBO number 687 to summit (I was number 2379 at Amicalola, meaning about 70% of the hikers that started before me either quit or haven’t summited yet). The Birches is a separate section for thru hikers a quarter mile down the road (do we smell that bad?) with a couple of small shelters, tent pads, and a privy. Even though there was an open lean-to, I chose to tent. There is no water so had to get back at the campground, but the black flies were so bad there I didn’t get a chance to wash my feet. There were a few hikers chilling around the campfire. Misty was the only one I knew, also Just and Strong (a couple) and Prick. I was hoping to get everything done early for a change, but we were all talking a so much still got chores done 8:30.

It was pretty chilly so I was slow getting ready and even made hot cocoa I had found in a hiker box. I was the last one out around 8.I left most of my stuff in a trash bag at the ranger station. They have daypacks you can borrow, but it felt weird using a different bag after this one for the last 4+ months. And without food bag, tent, etc. it was a dream!The first couple of miles of the trail were a little steep and rocky, but not bad. I was warm enough I could just wear T-shirt and shorts. But then it turned into serious rock climbing scramble. There was a break in the trees with a good view where I caught up to Misty and Prick. We all continued on together including above treeline.Finally we reached The Gateway which leads to Thoreau Spring and the Tablelands. Here the trail flattened out a bit and was regular walking up rocks. We took our time enjoying the views and euphoria.Finally, around 11am, we reached the summit. I thought I would be emotional and want some alone time but I was just happy and feeling good. There were about 15 day hikers there and we were treated like celebrities- everyone asking us questions, giving us food, etc. I stayed up for about an hour. Couldn't have asked for better weather - sunny skies, I thought would be cold and windy at the top but not at all.Since there was no need to go back the Hunt Trail/AT, I heard the Abol trail was easier so took that down. I think “easier” is relative as it was still some steep scrambling down. I would have taken a photo, but didn’t even want to look it would hurt my stomach!The trail finally flattened out (which my knees appreciated) and ended at a campground. It was a 2 mile road walk back to the main parking lot where I was meeting my parents. There was a lot of traffic so I figured I could get a hitch especially with all of them hikers/campers but no dice.When I got to the parking lot, my parents weren’t there and no cell service.

Half Full,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603320,"Well, I figured I should put in at least one post-trail update.I went back to the Charleston area with my parents and was busy with the holidays and Hurricane Florence. We debated evacuating but ultimately stayed which worked out because the area was spared. Unfortunately, North Carolina got hit pretty bad so I have been helping out the Red Cross virtually. Now that the holidays are over, I’m going to head up and assist in person (but as a volunteer so I can pick what I want to do!). Eventually I’ll need to figure out where I want to settle down (which I was supposed to have done on the trail), but for now I figure why not use some free time while I have it.Now, some updates on life after the trail:Physically:I only lost about ten or fifteen pounds (I didn’t weigh myself before leaving) and probably already put it back on. But I definitely didn’t look or feel super malnourished like some people get. I guess because I always fed the hiker hunger! I did lose that hunger and cravings for sugary junk food pretty quickly. Now just dark chocolate for dessert!My feet and back recovered pretty quickly after a few days off. My knees are a little creaky, and I feel them after sitting for a while. I think pushing it the last couple of weeks was not the best idea for them. So I’m going to look into stretches, etc. and if needed will go to a doctor.Psychologically:I still haven’t been that emotional about it and doesn’t internally feel like I’ve just done a huge accomplishment. Like everyone’s been congratulatory and it feels good, but it’s kind of back to business. I haven’t really had any huge epiphanies, but that wasn’t my goal.In terms of my reasons for hiking the trail, here’s where I stand; some were ones I knew in advance and others I didn’t realize were reasons until later:-Challenge myself (check!)-Learn new skills (check!)-Be comfortable outside in less than ideal weather (got somewhat better, so half check?)-Be outside so much I’ll be ok indoors afterwards (nope, I blame the abnormal number of rainy days on this as I still crave the sun)-Be more confident in wilderness situations (half check, as I was never really that far or from civilization or went longer than 5 days between resupply-Go with the flow more/flexibility/acceptance-Have a bunch of adventures (check!)I will say that I developed an appreciation for some of the things we take for granted, like indoor plumbing. I apologize if I already wrote about this, but one of the Sounds of the Trail interviewees was talking about how trail life is easy/straightforward (just walk), but a lot of the normal daily tasks are so involved. Like getting water involves finding a good source, filtering, etc. where in the “real world” can just turn on a faucet. I use real world in quotes there because some consider the trail to be more real/natural than fake people in society. Not sure my thoughts on that yet...A lot of people also realize that everything they need they carried on their backs and become more minimalist. This was not a big issue for me before the trail (basically only want what fits in my car anyway), but definitely will be culling some boxes.Overall:Not sure what else to update. I’m glad I did the blog as a historical record I can look back on, but it also nice now I can just go on a hike and not have to worry about mileage, remembering important events to include, etc.I have no desire to do a long distance hiking trip anytime soon. For the Triple Crown (Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental Divide) trails, they say you either do one or all three and right now I’m firmly in the former group. Just doing a day hike or weekend trip sounds really nice right now.Finally, for those keeping track the final list of items I lost/forgot (as far as I remember):
