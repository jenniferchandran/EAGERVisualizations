WMD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586885,"I'm starting my 2018 section hike on the 28th of April @ Penmar Park heading North.  This will be my longest section hike so far.  I plan on making it to Swatara State Park in ten days....but we'll see!  I completed the Md. section in 2016 and hiked from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry last year.  Each trip has been a learning experience to say the least.
Two weeks until the start of my trip and everything is pretty much in place.  I treated my clothes and hammock with permethrin so hopefully no ticks.  More to come as the starting date nears.","

WMD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586947,"So here is a little story of my first AT section hike that took place in late April of 2016.  Not understanding fully what I was about to get myself into, I decided to attempt an ""easy"" section of the AT.  I decided to start at PenMar Park and head South to Harpers Ferry.  I planned on a four day trip so I had my wife and sister-in-law drop me off at PenMar after we had left my truck at Harpers Ferry.  I was later told by my wife, that she and my sister-in-law made sure to remember exactly what I was wearing and a description of the three young gentlemen that followed me that day down the trail in case I disappeared!
 Within the first couple of hours my shoulders were killing me and I stopped numerous times to ""adjust"" my pack.  By the way, this beast was a 70 liter pack that weighed 7 1/2 lbs.  I bought it online, not knowing what I was looking for and not wanting to spend a lot of money.  I was also wearing five year old cheap hikers, carried my food in market bags inside of my pack and had an empty gallon water jug attached to the pack.  I'm sure I was quite a comical site going down the trail.
  By the second day every rock seemed like it was jabbing right through the bottom of my feet, the pack wasn't feeling any better but the weather was awesome and the people that I met were incredible.  From ""Scorched Heels"", who was completely self supporting his hike, a French Canadian guy who had 5 weeks off from work and decided to hike as far as he could, to the Mother/Daughter team from Australia.  The daughter had completed a thru hike the year before and decided to join her Mother to accompany her on a flip/flop attempt.
  Days three and four were more of the same, feet and shoulders killing me but the weather and people were great.  When I finally arrived in Harpers Ferry, I was exhausted and glad to be done with this trip.  I made the mistake of walking up to the NPS parking lot where I left my truck instead of taking the shuttle.  Stupidly I thought it was just a short walk up the hill, boy was I wrong.  By the time I reached my truck I was spent.  I had hiked a total of 41 miles and over 12 miles each of the last two days.  Not the smartest way to end my first backpacking adventure.  I thought to myself, ""Well, I got that out of my system.""  
  Funny thing though, as I was driving the 2 hrs. back to my house, I kept thinking about the previous four days.  And the closer to home I got, the more I thought about the things I would change to make my next trip more enjoyable.  Like, definitely invest in a lighter properly fitted backpack. (Osprey Atmos AG 65)  Invest in better hiking boots. (Merrell Moab Mids) and a more comfortable sleep system. (switched to a hammock)
  So the insanity began.  After the inaugural trip, I have researched everything and anything pertaining to hiking the AT.  I drive my wife nuts with the constant discussions about equipment, food, clothing and anything else that I may find interesting.  To her credit she just listens and doesn't tell me to shut the hell up. ( I've been known to repeat my self now and then.)  So as I prepare for my third section of the AT, I decided to log it here on Trail Journals since I'm on here all of the time.","PenMar Park

WMD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587603,"My second AT section hike was a lot more enjoyable.  A new pack and new shoes will do that.  I parked at the NPS in Harpers Ferry and had ""Trail Boss"" shuttle me to Front Royal, Va..  Trail Boss is a very interesting guy.  He is the President of the PATC and was the primary caretaker of Blackburn Shelter for quite a few years, lots of knowledge about the AT.  He was also the brain child behind the ""Roller Coaster"" which he warned me about.  The first day went really well, good weather and met several flip flop hikers.  ""Front Pockets"" was attempting a flip flop and we would leap frog each other over the next few days.  Day 2 was a long 12.9 mile day that ended at the Rod Hollow Shelter.  Day 3 would be the most enjoyable day on the trail...................not.  It rained all day, which I was prepared for, and included 9.5 miles of the infamous ""Roller Coaster"".  As much as people complain about it, I didn't think it was that bad.  I ended day 3 at Bear Den Hostel.  After a long hike in the rain, I thought a shower, hot meal, ice cream, clean clothes, a bunk and all you can eat pancakes in the morning, was worth $30.00!  Anyone who hike's this section should definitely plan on staying at Bear Den, if not a few miles further down the trail is the Blackburn Visitor Center/Shelter.  Day 4 ended after 11.1 miles of beautiful hiking weather.  Met two L.A.S.H.'s (long ass section hikers) Grumpy and Mountain Pappy.  These guys me last year on the trail and after talking awhile, realized they were born on the same day and year.  They've kept in touch ever since and hike together whenever possible.  Met three ""Frat brothers"" from Auburn University who pick something crazy to do each year together.  This year they decided to do a section hike even though they had never done anything like this before.  They had to cut the trip a little short but said they would do it again.  Day 5 started at David Lesser Shelter and ended in Harpers Ferry after 9.3 miles.  Heading into Harpers Ferry is a major drop in elevation.  I stopped by the ATC Headquarters and had my picture taken, I was #89 for this year.  So, after a successful section hike, I believe I'm hooked.  Each year I add a few more miles to my trip.  The first year I hiked 41 miles in four days, year two was 54 miles in five days.  Year three is going to be my biggest attempt yet.  The plan is 117 miles in 10 days but that is not set in stone.  I'll just hike to a ""loose schedule"" and see where I end up.  No matter how many miles I hike or how the weather has been, it's always been enjoyable.  So, next Saturday starts my 2018 adventure.  Hopefully I'll be able to figure out this new phone, journal from the trail and upload photos.  Since this is the first smart phone I've ever owned, it should be interesting.","Front Royal, Va.

WMD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588295,"Day 1 has been a great day.  After my stepson's, Jonathan & Danny, dropped me off @ Penmar Park, I ran into my first ever trail magic a couple of hours into my hike!  Thanks to Fresh Ground and his Leap Frog Cafe.  He was treating hikers to nachos, hot dogs, chicken tenders, fruit, cakes, and the list goes on and on.  Met several section hikers out for a few days, Slim, Seneca, Blaze Seeker, Curt & Tony just to name a few.  Met a thru hiker, Captain Black , who started February 1st and dealt with some extremely cold temps.  A pretty good first day.  Tmorrow will be 12.2 and it's supposed to be cold in the morning.  That ought to be fun......not.","Penmar Park

WMD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588637,"Day 4 was a great day to hike.  We passed the previous halfway point and took pictures.  The brothers, Full Throttle & The Row, ended their hike @ Pine Grove General Store.  Unfortunately the store wasn't open and neither was the museum.  We just hung out for awhile and charged our phones.  After 45 minutes Seneca, A.K.A. The Proffesor,  and I said our goodbye's.  The Row gave The Professor his name because he new more about The Row's heritage than The Row did.  I'm not sure if the name will stick but it has for us.  The climb out of Pine Grove Park was no joke.  It wasn't extremely steep, but it went on forever.  Tomorrow it's 12.0 miles into Boiling Springs where we'll stay at Lisa's Buck Off Hostel and resupply for my final push.  It's been a really good hike so far and I hope it continues.  Now it's time to go soak my feet and do some camp chores.","Tom's Run Shelter

WMD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588793,"Today was a tough 12 miles.  The Rock Maze was no joke!  There were several long accents that really seemed to zap my energy.  It was also 80 degrees and the final push was through the pastures outside Boiling Springs.  I ate at Cafe 101 and had a good burger.  I really haven't gotten that hungry but I've only been out for five days.  I'm staying at Lisa's Buck Off Hostel tonight with Seneca and Fat Tony.  Fat Tony is a young kid from Atlanta that previously spent 6 months on the PCT.  We're all headed to Darlington Shelter tomorrow.  That will be a 14.3 mile day with the first 11 miles fairly level.  The next day I'll head into Duncannon and call that my section for this year.  I had planned to make it to Swatera Gap but my feet aren't cooperating.  Regardless, it's been a good hike and I'll be out next year to add some more miles on.","James Fry Shelter

WMD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588936,"Today was a long hot one.  Started in Boiling Springs @ 9:00 a.m. after the hiker platter @ Cafe 101, which was great.  The first 12 miles were thru the Cumberland Valley which had little cover from the sun and even less water.  The last mile before the shelter was a steep incline.  The spring at that point was flowing good.  Once I arrived @ the shelter I drank the two liters I carried up and was hoping the spring @ the shelter was flowing, it was.  I'm sure it's going to be an early night for me, I'm wiped out!!  I think I've averaged 12 miles a day which I think is pretty good for a section hiker.  Tomorrow I'll finish in Duncannon where my stepson, Danny, will pick me up.","Boiling Springs

WMD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589036,"Today was humid and the rock steps coming down from Hawk Rock were an experience!  I'm sitting at The Doyle enjoying an ice cold beer waiting on Danny to join me for lunch before we head home.  I figure I've got to have lunch here before I end this years section hike.  This year's section has been enjoyable and a learning experience.  I've met some amazing people and experienced temps from 26 degrees to 91 degrees all in a seven day trip.  Although I didn't make it all the way to Swatera Gap, it's been a successful trip.  Next year I'll start here and head North again.  The rocks really started about 4 miles South of Duncannon and I'm sure they'll continue to the N.J. border.  It will probably take me two more years to complete P.A. but as long as I'm out here, I'll do what I can.  Good luck to all of the thru and section hikers I met on my journey, you have my utmost respect.  Hope to see you all again down the trail!!","Darlington Shelter
