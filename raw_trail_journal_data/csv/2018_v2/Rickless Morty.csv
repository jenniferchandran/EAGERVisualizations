Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585938,"After meeting Rick (the guy I plan on starting the trail with) 2 weeks ago on a short 17 mile one night backpacking shakedown hike, things were finally being set in motion to drive down from PA to GA to begin our journey. Rick wanted a location right off the turnpike so I suggested Marzoni's since it fits that criteria and I am (was) a Tuesday regular. At 18:30 Rick got to the brewery, I said my goodbyes to my parents as well as my bartenders who were convinced I would be eaten by bears. We got to Rick's sister's (Kathy) house in Chambersburg, PA and I met their mom for the first time as well. That night I slept on the floor with my thermo-rest and sleeping bag, beginning the normal trail routine.",,"Chambersburg, PA","Feb 27, Tue",0
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585942,"We left Chambersburg, PA at 08:00. It was a 10 hour drive and the GPS took us on the scenic tour it seemed for the last hour instead of taking main roads to the Comfort Inn in East Ellijay. We are planning on doing touristy things tomorrow. It still hasn't hit me that I will be beginning a 2100 mile trek tomorrow.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Wed",0
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585950,"We took a very sketchy dirt forest road for about 10 miles to the Springer Mountain parking lot. We tried to hike the 1 mile up to the southern terminus before the storms rolled through. We got caught in the storm on our way back down the mountain but we were staying at a hostel tonight so it wasn't a big deal. I did the day hike with my full pack because that's how I wanted to do the entire trail. We then drove to Amicalola Falls to register. I was 462. We walked around the base of the falls, took our pictures and proceeded to drive to the lodge and to the top of the falls as well. The Lodge was a ghost town maybe only 10 people in the whole place in the lobby. Having completed are list of touristy things, we ended our drive at Neel Gap where Rick and Kathy paid for a bunk and I decided to car camp, which seemed to become the norm for all my recent big adventures. Crazy to think it all really begins tomorrow!","Springer Parking Lot

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585951,"Left Neel Gap a little after 8 for the Springer Mountain parking lot. Our shuttle with Brett only cost us $50 for all 3 of us. It was a pretty good deal. We traded business cards. I figured that this is the guy I need when I'm guiding clients in northern Georgia. The wind wasted no time greeting us with fierce gusts right from the parking lot. I had made a schedule with excel with all the places I would be on what dates so that it would be easier for friends and family to meet me on the trail but we delayed a day because of the rain so I was already 17 miles behind schedule but schedules are meant to be broken. I had purchased 17 days worth of food in PA on the cheap not really knowing exactly how much I would eat and how long before I'd get sick of eating the same stuff. I bought a lot of instant grits and knorr rice sides. Luckily I only needed 9 days worth of food in the beginning to get me to my first resupply and the other 8 days will be waiting for me when I get to Boiling Springs, PA. I decided that I would just buy all my food for the whole hike. The grits were getting a bit much today for me. We enjoyed Atlanta, GA from a distance on top of Sassafras Mountain. So far no pain. The pace was a bit slow but this was expected and needed as well. It was pretty chilly all day, I never made it out of my rain gear. Made it to mile 12 today, only a few more to go, right?","Springer Mountain Parking Lot
","Cooper Gap, GA","Mar 02, Fri",11.20
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585953,"Left camp at 8:30. Very cold start today although it did warm up enough to strip down to just shorts and a T-shirt later. Met Scarlet from London at Gooch Mountain Shelter. Got some trail magic thanks to McGyvier. He was grilling hot dogs and had bananas and chips. Woody Gap was packed. We were hiking with Pat for a decent part of the day. We were the first to arrive at the campsite which we decided to stay at because the Lance Creek was pretty full and also heard that the Nora virus has been reported there in previous years. Pat joined us shorty, followed by Scarlet, old Mart, and the family (3 kids, a 2 yr old, and the parents). We had a tent city going with our 8 tents. Hoping tonight will be warmer then last night.","Cooper Gap, GA

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585957,"Left camp at 08:00. Watched the sunrise from camp. We were the first to hit the trail. Seemed to climb a lot today. Climbed to the highest point in Georgia on the AT, Blood Mountain. The climb was actually not too bad and the views were amazing from the top. Lots of weekenders and day hikers but it's Sunday so that happens. The trail down to Neel Gap was aggressive with lots of large rocks to scramble down from. Rick, Kathy, and I made it to Neel Gap around 2. They are both staying the night but I am going to press on. I passed my time at Neel Gap with a frozen pizza and some trail magic PBR. Good times. After a resupply, I left my Rick and his sister Kathy and hiked another 7 miles in under 3 hours until almost sunset and set up my tent by Preston for the night. He was a former Philmonter as well. He told me to look for his friends Zoltan, Meg, and Matt. It feels strange to finally start hiking my own hike.","Miller Gap off Dockery Lake Trail
","Hogpen Gap, GA","Mar 04, Sun",15
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585959,"Left camp at 07:15. Got some water at Low Gap Shelter which was apparently the place to be, maybe 20 people there. Received some trail magic at Unicoi Gap. Had myself a Gatorade, crackers, rice krispy treat, and a snickers. I met 2 thru hikers there as well. Josh, who was also a SUNY ESF alum like me but considering that everyone from my college wants to hike the AT, it really shouldn't come as too big of a surprise to run into a few. The other hiker I met was Eric. First 20 of the trek , and I did not feel too bad. I had company at the shelter tonight a different Josh who didn't have trekking poles, Shadow, Poncho Villay, and Road King. The trail was a bit rocky today. Calling for rain tonight.","Hogpen Gap, GA

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585960,"Left camp at 7:30. It rained until 13:00. Trail wasn't too bad just slippery from the rain. I hungout at the Top of Georgia Hostel for 2 hours to warmup, dry off, charge electronics, drink free coffee, and print out my Smokies permit. My Tray Mountain friends were supposed to make it to the Plumorchard Shelter but the rain caused them to change their minds and stay at the hostel. I met to more ESFers at the shelter. Nick was one of them. The shelter was 3 tiered, which was good because there must have been 27 people there.","Tray Mountain Shelter
",Plumorchard Gap Shelter,"Mar 06, Tue",15.50
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585962,Left at 6:30 today so I was the first to leave. Crossed into North Carolina today and it instantly dropped 10 degrees. There were some passing snow showers as well. I was surprised to find Preston's Zoltan and told him that Preston was on his way. Every ridge was super cold with powerful wind gusts. I am thinking of buying more layers at NOC before I go up into the Smokies.,"Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585963,"Left at 06:20. Super cold hiking today, hopefully today is the worst of it. Camping with Little Foot, Future, Mark, Strangler, Devin and Mark from London. 6 weekenders are here as well, not sure why they would want to backpack on such a cold weekend. You know it's cold when your pen won't write and you have to use a marker.","Carter Gap Shelter
",Siler Bald Shelter,"Mar 08, Thu",20
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585964,"Left at 06:40. Very cold but almost ended up in shorts and a T-shirt, almost. Visited 2 fire towers today both had great views. The trail down from the second one after the shelter was very rocky and precarious but also very breath taking. Met some more thru hikers at Rufus. Charlie Horse, Professor, Fox, and another gentleman that I didn't get his name. I found a hat on the trail today and carried it about 4 miles to Kristin from Tennessee at the second fire tower. We talked for a bit while enjoying the stunning views. It was nice, normally I just snap a picture and leave. This shelter is very cozy.","Siler Bald Shelter
",Rufus Morgan Shelter,"Mar 09, Fri",22.30
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585966,"Slept in late, 06:48 and left camp at 07:30. Got to the NOC at 08:15 but they were closed still so I road hiked up to the mini mart to resupply. I figured the prices might be a bit better as well but I was wrong. It was $50 to resupply for 7 days and I bought ramen noodles because everything else was priced so high. I did get a free orange out of the deal though. There must be a ww kayak festival at the NOC today because the parking lot was full of boaters. Seemed to be a lot of up hill again today. 6 people were at the shelter when I showed up. Some weekenders had some trail magic whiskey which was fun. Should be in the Smokies tomorrow.","Rufus Morgan Shelter
",Brown Fork Gap Shelter,"Mar 10, Sat",17
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585969,"Left camp at 07:13, first day of Day Light Savings Time. Trail was pretty easy to Fontana Dam. Got to the dam at noon. Took a shower, first real shower since I began my trek. I did my laundry in the shower as well and just hiked with my wet clothes on to dry them out. I checked out the ""Hilton"" of the AT shelters, Fontana Dam Shelter. I was originally planning on only going to the first campsite in the Smokies but I heard the weather was supposed to turn bad tonight so I pressed on to the first shelter instead. It got quite cold when I got to the shelter but lucky for me and everyone else there that night, it had stone walls and a nice tarp to block out the weather. It was cloudy/foggy but warm all day until the shelter. Met a group of hikers doing longer miles like me Cheddar, Stumbles, 50 lb., and Luke. I also saw my first bear today about 3 miles before the shelter, he was only about 150 lbs.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter
",Mollies Ridge Shelter,"Mar 11, Sun",24.60
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585971,"Left camp at 08:00. Rained most of the night until it switched over to snow. 1 inch of snow was already on the ground in the morning. It was just a blizzard today. It only snowed about 2.5 inches total but the wind made snow drifts up to 1.5 feet deep in places. The wind was just howling all day. Camping with some PA Spring breakers and Cheddar, Stumbles, 50 lb., and Luke again. Tomorrow is supposed to be nicer.","Mollies Ridge Shelter
",Silers Bald Shelter,"Mar 12, Mon",17.80
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585974,"Left camp at 08:00. Very cold and windy again today. Hiked through some 2 foot snow drifts on my way to Clingmans Dome. It was crazy to see this large concrete structure on the top of the mountain. Unfortunately, it was too cloudy to see anything except the ice build up on everything. The ice looked like 3 inch feathers on the trees and structures. I said goodbye to my pseudo family at the gap, they were happy to hear that the road was open. I got 5 bottles of water and 2 handfuls of chips at the gap after talking to a man who was just driving through. We took a photo together. I remembered to loosen my shoe laces before I went to bed so it would be easier to put my frozen shoes on.","Silers Bald Shelter
",Ice Water Spring Shelter,"Mar 13, Tue",16.40
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585976,"Left camp at 08:30. Very cold and windy again, this seems to be the norm for the Smokies. It snowed until 13:00. Lots of drifts today, some were up to 2.5 feet deep. The trail was very treacherous today, I fell 5 times today and I don't fall. My one water bottle was so frozen that it broke last night so I'm only down to 1 liter of water capacity but half of it is frozen solid. I heard that family got giardia but are still on the trail. Hopefully this is the last cold night for a while, tomorrow is supposed to be 55! Today was my first good views of the Smokies. Slowly getting my $20 worth. Camped with Magic, Bailey, and Jay who got named Apollo after he made us a fire.","Ice Water Spring Shelter
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"Mar 14, Wed",20.30
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585978,"Left camp at 08:42. It was still cold in the morning. My hiking shoes weren't rock solid frozen for the first time in 2 mornings. The trail finally had only a little snow and it was rated for horses all the way down to Davenport Gap so it was fast. Magic and the guy she was with passed me running down the trail. We took a snack break together and walked down the rest of the way. There was leftover trail magic from a day ago that consisted of a burger and fruit. I took my chances on the burger. The 3 of us walked into Standing Bear Hostel where I got 2 PBR's and found a replacement water bottle in the hiker box. All my hiker friends from last night stayed at the hostel. It felt like we experienced every season today. Can't believe we made it through the Smokies, it feels really good to be out and warm. There were 27 high schoolers with 5 leaders at the shelter area but they were tenting. I met Fire Starter at the shelter.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Very easy hike with an easy grade today. I had the best trail magic so far on the trail at Lemon Gap. Fresh Ground and his Leap Frog Cafe had it all. I had 2 bowls of chili, 2 grilled cheese, 1/2 lb. of french fries, 1 hot dog, 2 fudge cookies, and lots of fruit punch. I need to look him up on Facebook. Took a creek shower and did some creek laundry as well before heading to Hot Springs tomorrow. Also met Ellie at Max Patch and she is sending me pictures from her fancy camera.","Groundhog Creek Shelter
",Walnut Mountain Shelter,"Mar 16, Fri",13.10
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608041,"I left camp at 8:20. The trail was pretty easy down to Hot Springs. When I made it to town, I checked out Laughing Heart Hostel. Then I resupplied for 3 days but ended up buying food for 4 days at Dollar General or ""the mall"" as the locals call it. I noticed the visitors center and got the inside scoop on where to eat/drink in town from the employee there, Robert. I decided to pitch my tent on the bank of the river and then go back into town to enjoy the Saint Patrick's Day fun. I decided to eat at Mosaics and had a few beers before checking out Tobacco Road to get more craft beer. I ended up sharing a 6 pack with two locals on the hill behind the store. There was an older gentleman and a girl named Shelby that I chatted with for a while. Shelby preformed an original song which was quite amazing as she played her Ucayali. I ended up going to Spring Creek Tavern and Inn for a few more beers and food. I met up with Apollo and Bailey, then the Hammock Girls later. I walked them to my tent and we drank under a tarp and watched the lightening from a passing thunderstorm. I managed about 7 beers that night.","Walnut Mountain Shelter
",Hot Springs,"Mar 17, Sat",14
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608163,"Left camp at 9:15. Felt a bit hungover as expected. Sad to say goodbye to the hammock girls, they were a fun bunch. The trail had a nice overlook of Hot Springs. The trail was pretty easy until after Little Laurel Shelter. It had lot's of rock climbing but very nice views. There was a trail angel at Little Laurel Shelter. Bloodhound had wine, cheese, crackers, summer sausage, and cottage cheese with black berries and raspberries. He also had a snickers bar. He writes for ""The Trek"" and has a Facebook page. I stayed for about an hour and a half, long enough that I needed a headlamp to finish the trail to the shelter. I got there by 8:30 pm. There was only one guy there with a tent when I got there, which was the least number of people I have seen at a shelter so far this trip.","Hot Springs

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608164,"Left camp at 8:35. Caught up to Joker, gave him one of my cards. The trail was pretty fast today not too many views until Bald Mountain. Also met Inside Out, she had some police matter involving a creepy guy named Castle from Erwin, TN. Talked to Brian at the shelter. Five other people were here tonight as well. Had 4G at the top of Bald Mountain but nothing at the shelter. I stopped at Laurel Hostel 10 miles in for two beers and a pizza for $7. I ran by a father son team Tim and Paul. It got cold and windy again. Winter is coming....back.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Temperature dropped again after I reached the shelter again. I got caught in a little rain right before the shelter. Apparently it is supposed to snow 2-4 inches or maybe 8-10 inches tonight/tomorrow. I stopped at Uncle Johnny's Hostel today to charge up and rented a bike for $3 to go to town to resupply since Johnny's resupply was pricey and slim. I ate an entire large cheese pizza by myself near the grocery store I resupplied at. Pretty sure Uncle Johnny's has craft beer. I pressed on to the shelter and was the only one there. I should run into Fresh Ground from Leap Frog Cafe tomorrow. Hopefully the snow isn't so bad. This was the first day not seeing snow since Georgia!,"Bald Mountain Shelter

There was a 1/2 inch of snow on the ground when I woke up, then an additional 3-4 inches fell while I was hiking with drifts up to 3 feet. Although most drifts only reached around 2 feet. I fell down twice on this very challenging day. I stopped at Cherry Tree Shelter for a snack and someone left a pound of spam, so I ate that instead of my snack. I also found someone's sleeping pad 5 miles before the hostel. I only had to pay $7.50 to sleep on the hostel floor with a shower (a price too good to beat). It felt good to be clean again.I spent a total of $16 total with snacks and such. I mooched off some spring breaker's pizza they offered me for dinner. This will make tomorrow a lot more tolerable. I met Shorts at the hostel for the first time.","Curley Maple Gap Shelter NC

Realized my water bottle fell out of my bag so I ran all the way back to Greasy Creek Hostel ( about a mile back). Ended up with a late start because of that. I stopped at Hugh's Gap for the Leap Frog Cafe experience with Fresh Ground. I eat 4 grilled cheese with sliced chicken on them, 1 hot dog, 3 chocolate swirl things, some fries, hot chocolate, and cool aid. I left because my toes were frozen. There was about 3-4 inches of snow on the ground with many 2 foot drifts with some 3 foot drifts. It was pretty slow going today but 17 miles isn't too bad for the given trail conditions and water bottle situation. I climbed to 6,300 feet today. I should be around only 4,000 feet until Damascus, so hopefully it will be warmer. I am sleeping in a big red barn tonight. It is pretty cool actually. I'll be closing out North Carolina tomorrow!","Greasy Creek Hostel, NC

I went over some 2 foot snow drifts today. The snow thinned out a lot at the lower elevations and it also felt pretty warm today. Only passed 1 thru hiker all day and it was a very long day. I did the hiker marathon today! Tomorrow will be long as well. Hopefully the rain isn't too bad. It is very windy at this shelter tonight. I finished North Carolina today!","Over Mountain Shelter, NC

I never found the owner of the sunglasses I found yesterday. I didn't pass any thru hikers today but I haven't been seeing many in the last few days. The snow changed to rain during the day, then freezing rain at 7 PM. I stopped in at Black Bear Resort for 2 beers and a pizza. The owners were nice and even drove me back to the trail. The Laurel Fork Gorge was very cool to see. I saw fresh bear footprints about 2.3 miles from the shelter I was staying at. Makes me wish that I didn't get my bear bag rope stuck at Curly Maple Shelter. I hiked 52 miles in the last 48 hours, which is pretty crazy to think about. Pro tip, don't eat mashed potatoes before they fully rehydrate or else they will block your throat worse than peanut butter.","Moreland Gap Shelter, TN
","Vandeventer Shelter, TN","Mar 24, Sat",24
Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608172,"Left camp at 8 AM. I listened to trees and branches breaking all last night. I thought it was bear activity at first. I woke up to about 0.3 inches of ice on everything. I watched a 2 inch diameter branch fall just 15 feet from the shelter. For the first 8.5 miles I'm not sure how I didn't get hit with any branches. It was like holding a 12 foot metal rod on a treeless mountain with a thunderstorm coming. Branches were falling every few minutes. Some were just over 6 inches in diameter. the next 2.5 miles of the day was done in a forest hail. The sun and rising temperatures melted the ice enough that the wind blew the ice off in mini hail storms. It felt like you were target practice for new paintball players, a lot of shots fired but only a few good hits. It had a punch to it. The second half of the day was beautiful with full sun and zero hazards. I met Deb and K---something. They found a lost puppy and gave me the rest of their hiking snacks. I was very grateful and gave them my card so they could follow me on my journey. I'll be done with Tennessee tomorrow!","Vandeventer Shelter, TN

I went to Pizza Plus for the lunch buffet and ate about a 1.5 large pizzas. I felt sick and so incredibly full that I had to waddle out and take a nap in the grass. After 45 minutes, I could walk normally again and went to Food City and got snacks for 7 days and dinner for 4 days. I used someone else's rewards card to save $42 while only spending $37. Someone told me the brewery was closed and to go to Mojo's for a beer. I had 2 then walked 8.5 miles to the shelter. It is the first time in 4 nights that I am not alone at a shelter.

The trail was covered in snow from the base of the mountains to this shelter. There was 6 inches of snow in some places and 6 inches of water in others. My bottom retainer broke off. The top of Whitetop had an amazing 360 degree view. Mount Rodgers had a decent view it is the highest point in Virginia. After descending from Mount Rodgers, the AT became hard to follow and extremely wet. This was right before the wild ponies. I saw quite a few today.

I wasn't planning on staying but got suckered into it. I got my clothes washed by machines for the first time on the trail and got my third real shower. We went to The Barn for dinner. It seemed like everything was disapointing except for the Hiker Burger with cheese. I had 2 of them (4 patties total). I got some beer at the gas station to unwind with.

There was a scenic rocky section that was slow hiking but the rest of the trail was fast. I left Big Sky and Lotus 16 miles in today. It was quite a bit lonely without them, I will say. I ran into a section hiker ""Work Around"" 4 miles later and gave him one of my cards. I went to Brushy Mountain Outpost and had a bacon cheeseburger, a cheeseburger, a BLT, cajan fries, regular fries, and a big bowl of coffee toffee ice-cream, all for $21! The owners were super nice and they liked Planned Exploration's Facebook Page. Blackbird, Hummingbird, and No Point were all there when I got in. I was very full and struggled to make it to the shelter. ""Now"" showed up and seemed to have a lot of complaints but he gave me about 5 dinners.

I guess I had too much fried food because I ended up with bad diarrhea. I had to dig my first cat hole today at mile 620 because of it. The next 8 miles were fast and went through rhododendrons. Made the decision at Walpiti to press on. It was a great choice because I needed to change the credit card for my phone by tonight. There was also trail magic 2.2 miles from the shelter. Someone left a six pack of Blue Moon and only 1 left. I took my beer with me to enjoy under full moon at the shelter. Big Sky texted me, we may meet up again hopefully!

There was a cooler of Cokes and Mountain Dews (I had a coke). I walked to the tractor supply first to get a new bear bag line. Then I was going to eat at the Chinese buffet Lucky Star but they were closed today. I went to the food Lion to resupply. I was still looking forward to a buffet so I walked to the Pizza Hut but their buffet was only Wednesdays and Sundays. I went to my last resort of Pizza Plus again. I charged my camera and signed up for Trail Journals while I ate. I went to La Barranca Mexican Grill for a beer and realized that I should have eaten there. They had better food and it was still very affordable and they also had charging ports. On my way out of town, I passed ""No Shoes"" and ""Research"" slackpacking to town. I also passed some people protesting the pipeline that was going in near the trail. I got to the shelter and talked to the two nice women that were also staying the night.","Doc's Knob Shelter, VA

I went to the church hostel right before the thunderstorm to check in and get a bunk then I went back to Sycamore Grille and Kat tried to buy me a drink.

We planned on camping at Unionville for Cinco de Mayo but the only bar there gave off such an unwelcome vibe that we decided to press on to the next shelter 5 miles away. We got a camping permit, did some grocery shopping, and went for pizza before the bar so it wasn't a total loss. We packed up and left Unionville at 8 PM. We did a lot of running in the beginning before the light faded, luckily the trail was super fast and flat. We only had 1 headlamp so we had to go slow once it out super dark.

I got picked up at 8. I learned that the nutrition bars are in the pharmacy isle. I ate my 2 remaining pieces of pizza and drank lots of water while I packed my food. Small Furry Animal left some junk food so I ate 2 brownies as well. The trail is getting better from the Whites, but still had some crazy sections. There were lots of good views today. I said goodbye to Scout Master mid trail. There are lots of floating bog boards. I am camping with ""Small Furry Animal"" and 3 others.","Rattle River Lodge & Hostel, NH

I got up at 5 AM to use the latrine and get water, then I went back to sleep for a bit. I hiked through the Notch with ""Care Bear"" who is finishing a thru hike from last year. It was very slow, around 0.5 mph slow. It would be very fun to day hike but it is cumbersome with a full pack on. I had to unstrap my backpack quite a few times to get through some of the cracks and such. There were some pretty tough climbs as well but amazingly beautiful views. It was a very tough day and my body is sore from trail. I am with Small Furry Animal again tonight. I postholed once in the deep snow that is still found deep in Mahoosuc Notch.","Full Goose Shelter, ME

The temperature seemed to drop as well past Hall Mountain Shelter. It was a ghost shelter, there was all this gear there but no one was around. The terrain wasn't so bad today but it was just cold, rainy, and windy so it made for a miserable day. I thought I was done with this cold weather stuff. I met a Maine state section hiker who zeroed in the shelter. ""Smart"" and ""Cub"" are one section away from completing the AT. Small Furry Animal was here again. I made the mistake of getting wet again.","Frye Notch Shelter, ME

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609555,"I left at 6:30 AM and got to camp at 2:40 PM. It only rained a bit, 2 miles away from the hostel for 45 minutes. The trail was decently fast and I was only going to stay at the hostel to eat dinner and charge things but I suckered myself in. It was so nice to get out of the rain and sleep in a bed. I had 2 PBR pounders and the owner gave me chips and salsa and lentil soup. We drove to the gym to take showers and then we went to Sarges Pub for food. I had a burger and 2 more beers. We went drunk grocery shopping and I bought way too much food but maybe I'll just eat more. It was my last resupply of the trip. So close but so far yet. Hopefully everything works out. Small Furry Animal is here too and I ran into ""Mainer"" at the grocery store.","Bemis Mountain Lean-to, ME

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609559,"I left at 8:20 AM and got to camp at 6:45 PM. I wanted to sleep in but then I noticed that my pack's internal frame was sheared on the other side so the owner of Hiker Hut gave me a tent stake to splint it with. I got a donut and drank root beer and also ate the rest of Small Furry Animal's nachos and Oreos from last night. The owner gave us a ride back up to the trailhead. The trail wasn't so bad, decently fast but very wet. There were periods of showers with cloud mist in between. I didn't see anyone all day until I got to the shelter. to find ""Solo"" a 66 year old man who SOBOs every 10 years or so since 2001. Then ""Mainer"", ""TG 500"", ""Sour Patch"", and ""Blackbeard"" showed up. I am eating a lot of food but that is fine since I bought so much yesterday. Only 200 miles left! I'm ready to be human again.","Hiker Hut Hostel, ME

It was a decently steep climb up the mountain and now the bugs are started to make a comeback. I passed the 2000 mile marker today. I got wet from brushing up against brushes. It is supposed to be nice after today though. I am meeting more true SOBOs. ""Drew"" and dog are tenting and ""Whip"" is in the shelter tonight. I would have pressed on but they were calling for rain so I stayed put and the rain did come so I'm glad I stayed.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to, ME

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609565,"I left at 6:00 AM and got to camp at 6:00 PM. I walked over to Harrison's camp for a $12 breakfast (12 pancakes, 3 sausages, and 2 eggs). It was very good but I needed more food. I left at 8 AM. I saw a 70 lb. black bear 1 mile from Harrison's camp. I got to the canoe ferry just in time to ride over right as I got there. I got my last mountain views before heading into the 100 Mile Wilderness tomorrow. The bugs are getting bad again but I only have a few days left to deal with them. I started a fire to help keep them away. I used the last of my toilet paper from Devil's Backbone Brewery in Virginia. It lasted 1,216 miles, almost as long as my pack lasted before it failed! I'm here with the gang again tonight.","Pierce Pond Lean-to, ME

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609568,"I left at 5:30 AM and got to camp at 5:00 PM. I hiked with Mainer most of the day. We had to ford some rivers today but the trail was decently fast still. There are lots of roots and mud. We took a snack break at at Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to and two young girls and their dog were there. I said goodbye to the gang today at the road to Monson. A bird, maybe a grouse attacked TG 500 and made weird noises at Mainer and I. I hiked 10 miles to the shelter by myself. I passed a bunch of SOBO hikers (maybe 7). It feels like college graduation now, just walking to get get my diploma. I am sharing the shelter with ""1k"" tonight. I named him after he told me he was surviving off 1k calories for his first 3 days on the trail. I am going to break the 2100 mile mark and have less than 100 miles left tomorrow. It is pretty crazy to think about, it is starting to get very real.","Moxie Bald Lean-to, ME

I felt pretty slow for the first 4.5 miles, then I met ""Postcard"" at the first shelter I passed. She has been flip flopping sections since December 1st. She only has the 80 miles to Katahdin left. It was nice chatting with someone all day. It made the hike seem faster. We took lots of breaks at mountain views and shelters. My body didn't seem to hurt so bad. My shoe ripped quite a bit more today. I will probably need to sew it tomorrow on the trail or at the campsite. I ran into ""Blaze"" from Chestnut Knob Shelter, back in Virginia. I need to remember to email Postcard pictures. I'm here at the shelter with a young couple. I told them I would drive them where ever they wanted once they got to Boiling Springs, PA. Just 2 more nights on the trail before Katahdin base camp.","Wilson Valley Lean-to, ME

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609650,"I left at 6:10 AM and got to camp at 4:15 PM. I was the first to leave the shelter. I had my last mountain climb today before Katahdin. I took a break on White Cap and Small Boardman Mountain. Katahdin looked very close from White Cap. There were so many couples attempting a SOBO thru hike and also a lot of not so prepared SOBOs. They will learn lessons soon enough or will find themselves off the trail. There were also so many bugs out and at this campsite and they are starting to drive me insane. Hopefully with an early start tomorrow, I can get in a few bug-free miles. I have one more shelter in the woods before I see Jon and eat real food. I don't think I have ever carried so much trash on the trail before but I never stopped in Monson. At least my tent is bug-free. I hope it doesn't rain but it doesn't really matter too much at this point since this is my last day setting up the tent!","Carl A. Newhall Lean-to, ME

I thought the mosquitoes wouldn't be so bad this morning but it was warm all night and they were waiting for me. I packed up twice as fast as I intended to just so I could get moving. I passed a lot of SOBOs today. I was dehydrated because I didn't want to deal with the mosquitoes while I was got water. Luckily the bugs are not too bad at the shelter, plus I built a fire to keep them at bay. I met ""Rose"" on the last mountain. Apparently she was hiking in Roanoke, VA and ran into Fresh Ground and heard about me. I gave her a card. I am camping with 2 SOBOs tonight, Greg who is 22 and ""Chief"" who is 77 and is going for his second SOBO. His first was in 2013. They were both pretty cool. It is almost sad to think that this is the last night before the big finish but I think I'm ready.","Jo-Mary Rd. Tentsite, ME

The trail was pretty easy and fast. It was very buggy whenever you stopped hiking. I gave out lots of cards. I stopped at Abol Bridge for snacks and beer. It started raining while I was there. I bought cookies, a 6 pack, and Gatorade. I spent about $20. I met Dave outside the store and traded a beer for his one pound jar of peanut butter. I think I ate about 4000 calories there. I registered at Katahdin Stream and found out that I was the 8th NOBO thru hiker down from 462 when I registered in Georgia. I got to the #4 lean-to an hour before Jon. He made pasta and we had bananas.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to, ME

He said that he will text me about gear and that he knows the owner of Zeroday Resupply. He did the PCT and a bunch of other trails. I Met Beth from ESF 2018, the school Jon and I graduated from in 2014. I gave out a lot of cards. I gave the Katahdin sign a hug. I saw Small Furry Animal and Mainer on my way down.

Rickless Morty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609670,"It's hard not to say that this was the most monumental experience of my life but as I recount my journey by adding my entries almost a year after it was all said and done, it was the most amazing experience and I miss everything about it. Was it hard? Yes, it was hard. Did I want to quit? Yes, many times I felt like quitting. The pull of Katahdin always kept me going and knowing that many people will only dream of finishing and I knew that I wanted to know what it was like to finish and not daydream about it. It is without a doubt the most rewarding experience of my life. I'd say my biggest regret is not taking pictures of the people I met while hiking. I can almost picture everyone I met but I know the memories will slowly fade. I still wish I could have hiked the trail with someone but you can't wait your whole life for the right person and the right time. I am very glad I kept a journal, although it was a pain most of the time, it gives me enough detail to recount all the little details of each day that made the hike so great. I am also glad I had an everything proof camera and did not rely on my phone as a camera. I'd say that the trail is 80% mental and 20% physical. You just have to listen to you knees and adjust your mileage accordingly. If you have any questions, concerns, or want advice feel free to reach out to me at Planned.Exploration@Gmail.com.
