Ron Brown Shuttle service pick me up at Unicoi Gap @ 7:15 and we were off. Good thing I had the front seat as I would have gotten car sick on those winding roads…yikes!!! Ron had some great advice and words of caution for the trail. He is a great guy!!! He dropped me off at the visitor’s center for the approach trail hike. I signed the registration, weighted my pack, photo of the arch and started up the trail – 9:15ish
The stairs weren’t too bad – if you take it slow and steady – the hours fly by!!! Got to the top of Springer Mtn about 12:00. Beautiful place—I watched all the videos of this location and the videos seem to make the area look a lot larger then what it is. It’s a lot smaller location then you would think. I met Carol and loafkin at the top. Carol and I started hiking the trail and she is one of the toughest ladies I have ever met. I was making great time and decided to hike to Hawk Mtn Campsites. This area was done up well – clean, water source, and privy!! Very Nice.","Approach Trail

I slept pretty good. I was up at 5am and on the trail at 6am. I like to fill up my water in the morning to keep it as fresh as possible and I don’t like to sleep with the water bottle at the bottom of the foot box just in case of a leak and the water is cold on my toes.  Today was to hike as far as possible due to the weather changing on Saturday (Rain). Today was sunny and high 50’s – perfect.  The goal was to hike to Lance Creek and climb Sassafras Mtn and Ramrock mtn. As soon as I reached Lance Creek a group pushed on to Jarrad gap and I though why not – 19 miles in total. Crazy I know… The funny thing about the trail is that most of the large mtns are easier then the small ones…why?? More switch backs on the larger mtns. The smaller mtns are straight up climbs…very few switch backs. The down hills are killer just like most have said.  Jarrard was rather packed with about 15-20 hikers. I entered a bubble, but got to know a lot of great people in this bubble. I was able to stay with this group for the next several days and had a blast. Some people on the trail I got to know are: Carol, Honeybun, soothsayer, Amber and Paul, Canada, Eric, Ave, and Sassafras. What a great day!!","Hawk Mtn Shelter

I did not sleep well. Hot on and off – kinda sweaty. I need to work on a better way to control my temperature. Today is a short day – 10 miles. Just hiking to Baggs Creak Gap – not in the AWOL guide. It did rain in the morning but stopped by 12ish – I was the last out of camp today – decided to sleep in a little with the bad nights’ rest. Stopped at Neels Gap to see the outpost and the famous tree with shoes. Got some more candy bars and other items.  Sun came out and hiked the rest to Baggs Creek. Hiked with Will who is a young 20 something and we ended up passing Baggs Creek and hiking up a mtn. We decided to turn around at the top to stay with the group. Great decision and the group was a blast.","Jarrard Gap

I did not sleep well again. I can’t get my temp right – too hot and then too cold!!! I need to practice more. I think I need to entertain the idea of a hammock…no sure. Got up with the rest of the camp and headed out around 7. I was only going to do 10 miles but the group wanted to push a little and get about 14 miles to Blue Mtn Shelter. I though..why not… OH BOY!!! This was not an easy 14 miles – the down hills were killing me. My knees were really shaky on the down hills. Canada and I hiked together and we had great conversation. He is a very nice guy. We finally reach Blue Mtn Shelter and it was not a large area. There was a large bubble of people coming up from behind me and only myself and one other hiker were thru hiking. I decided to hike the next 2 miles to my vehicle and head to the hotel. There supposed to be heavy rain in the morning and I didn’t want to deal with a wet tent in the car – So I hiked the next 2 miles and drove to the hotel. The first order of business was to order a hamburger and fries along with two large bags of ice for my knees!!!
I just took a 5-day long hike on the Appalachian Trail that rewarded me with so many wonderful experiences from the physical, mental, spiritual, and social. The trail was difficult, which I approached as a challenge. I enjoyed every minute of the hike – from the crazy elevation climbs, hiking in the rain, and getting water from the side of a mountain.
I knew there would be so many positive experiences but didn’t realize the gravity of it all. The trail has the ability to simplify your world and it teaches you to enjoy the simple things, such as laughter and comradery. Every night around the campfire fellow hikers from all over the world met up after a day of hiking to share their reason for being on the trail, laugh, tell jokes and tell stories - truly a special time!!! You develop an amazing relationship with complete strangers who are all experiencing the trail in different ways.
There is a tradition in which hikers are given trail names during their hike - I had earned the name “muddyshoes”. This name was given to me a number of years ago by my kids. It’s a special name that is near to my heart.
Some great people to mention are Lofkin, Canada, Carol, Sassafras, HoneyBun, Ave, Amber and Paul. We were experiencing the trail together and lifting each other up every day! These people really were becoming by Tramily....even after only 5 days!!
This was one of the most special and incredible experiences of my life!!! I can’t wait to go back!!!","Baggs Creek Gap - not in AWOL guide
