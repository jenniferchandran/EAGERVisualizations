Hindsight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583735,"In April of 2018 I plan on starting my wilderness adventure of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). Part of the tradition is picking a trail name. You can start with a trail name of your choosing, but oftentimes you are given a name through your misfortunes or unique personality traits. For example 'Ill' because they threw up many times in succession, 'Banana Split' for their bright yellow shorts, and Paul Bunyan for obvious reasons.
I am going to start with the trail name Hindsight. As most of us do, I look back at things in my life that I could have handled better. People I should have been nicer to, mean things said in the heat of the moment, and avoiding events and celebrations because sometimes it's easier and less stressful. 
Hindsight will be a way of reminding myself that you can't change the past, but you can learn and grow from it and move forward. Most importantly, forgive yourself for being human and don't make the same mistakes. So, I will try and remember that: ""The real trick is to turn hindsight into foresight that reveals insight"". - Robin Sharma.",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Wed",0

I walked over 4 hours today in the rain, high winds, and mud. There wasn't one stitch of dry clothing on my body. At times the rain
was blowing sideways and I couldn't see but a few feet in front of me. To sum it up it was a FANTASTIC day! As the saying goes;
'A bad day hiking (or whatever your favorite past time) is better than a good day at work'. 
As I was walking two things kept entering my thoughts:
1. There are no mountains in central Ohio. You can't simulate the Appalachians or any other mountain range. I thought about petitioning the State of Ohio to build a mountain somewhere close to my house, but I worked in government for too many years to know that wasn't going to work. The best I can do is walk up a big hill, walk back down, and then walk back up again... many times! Not the same, but it will have to do for now.
2. After being muddy, wet, and miserable for the better part of my hike I get to go home and eat a good meal, take a hot shower, and
sleep in a warm bed. On the trail that's not going to happen. Which leads me to my final thought...
Attitude is everything. I have a feeling there will be weeks of rain in my near future and the only thing I can do is suck it up
and tough it out. Time will tell if my attitude carrys over.",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Tue",0

Hindsight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587657,"I brought a mascot with me; Carl Jr. (Pictured at the Ga. / N.C. state lines). He has the tough job of listening to me complain about having to carry his sorry hind quarters  from here to Maine! He hasn't started talking back yet.
4/22 - Went up Albert Mtn. Was using hand / foot climbing in a couple of places. Tough climb. Saw a hiker and his dog at the top of the mountain. He said he had to carry, himself, his pack, and his dog in a couple of places! Can't imagine.
Last 3 days a total of 51 miles. Total miles on A.T.: 109.5.","

Hindsight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588046,"Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to - Jackson Brown, These Days
 One of the things that I personally forgot to do is tell my siblings what they mean to me. As I walk, I think about our days growing up. Here is the cast of characters:
Bev - Bev is the Alpha Dog of the family. You mention to Bev that you have any event coming up, and before you finish the sentence she can have it planned down to place settings. I'm thinking that's part of being the oldest. She is also equal parts big sister and mother to me.
Marsha – Marsha was born tongue tied. It was always a family joke that ever since they un-tongue tied her (tongue-ectomy?), she hasn't stopped talking! In her younger years she might have been less than nice to her little brothers (we never did a thing to torment her!), but let someone outside the family be mean to us and she was ready to rip their heart out of their chest.
Susan – Susan was the emotional (sensitive) one. Having 4 younger brothers would make any normal person emotional! When it was her turn to clean up after dinner, you best keep your hand on your plate at all times! If you turned your head she would have cleaned your place setting and washed the dishes before you could bat an eye. This actually happened to her ex (Larry). He went to the bathroom during dinner and when he returned his plate was long gone. We all had a good laugh about that. Well, everyone except Susan and Larry.
Rob – Rob tried to be a mentor and good big brother to me, but I was too young and dumb to listen to him.
He was an exceptional athlete in his prime and would have been even better had it not been for surgery on both legs and feet because he grew too fast as a teenager. The good thing (well, only to me) about his surgery was he couldn't catch me for a long time afterwords if I were to call him names.
Rick – I picked on Rick a lot when we were young even though he was older than me. When he finally had enough, he punched me in the face and bloodied my nose. I did what any young boy would do and ran and told mom. She proceeded to whip him with a switch. How many times have you heard the phrase 'whip him with a switch' lately? It was a good lesson for me because I never picked on him again.
Ron – I picked on Ron growing up too (do you see a pattern here?). I wish I could have been a better big brother. Maybe it was because I was the youngest until Ron came along. Then I became the cursed middle child after that.I remember watching Ron wrestle when he was in Jr. High. I swear he was part rubber man. His body was twisting in ways it wasn't meant to be twisted! It didn't seem to bother him at all. I'll be a better big brother in the next life!
So this is what I think about as I walk. I am truly grateful to have these people in my life. It's been a blessing to share my life with you. I love each and every one of you.","

Hindsight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588048,"It was a beautiful day today. The sun was shining, clear blue sky with a light breeze. A great day to be alive.As I was walking I noticed two bear cubs about 50 feet away playing in a field. I paused on the trail to watch them frolic (do cubs frolic or romp?) . On the other side of the trail I heard a very low growl. I turned and saw what must have been the momma bear. She looked none too happy that I was between her and her cubs. I was also none too happy to be in this position.In researching what you should do when you cross paths with a bear, there is no definitive answer. I have read you should never make direct eye contact and stand still. There is also the play dead routine, and the way I smelled it was crazy enough to work! I might have even read you can sing show tunes to confuse the bear.In my surprise predicament, all reason flew out the window and I panicked. I couldn't think of any show tunes, so I started running like my hair was on fire! I glanced at the bear as I ran away and it seemed to smirk at me as if saying 'Game On'.If you know anything about bears, then you know they are fast. Maybe not Usain Bolt fast, but a lot faster than a 57 year old man running in boots. The bear caught up to me in a matter of seconds. I caught my boot on a root and went tumbling to the ground. As I looked back the bear was about to jump on its prey.Lions and tigers and bears...Oh My! Just as he pounced I let out a blood curdling scream that I'm sure sounded like a young child getting his finger caught in the door. I'm pretty sure as I sat up in my sleeping bag shaking like a leaf that the scream was just in my dream. If the scream had happened, anything with a heartbeat in a five mile radius would have heard me. The fact that I sweating profusely with goose bumps the size of marbles on my body made it seem very real. In the days to come, I'll be sure to be on the loomout for bear cubs!So that's my bear story, and I hope it remains a figment of my imagination.Note to self: Do not eat anchovies and orange slices before bed ever again!","

Hindsight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588166,"I'm  usually pretty good at achieving goals I set for myself. With much regret and sadness this isn't one of those times.
I loved the hiking part. In the first week I hiked 39 miles in 2 days in the mountains of Georgia and North Carolina. That part was fun. The camping aspects to me were less than enjoyable, especially when it rained 7 of the first 10 days and snowed once.
A typical camping day would consist of:
Finding a water source and filtering drinking water twice a day.
Setting up the tent and unpacking all items needed for the evening  (sleeping bag, clothes, food, etc.).
Hanging your food bag from a tree to keep it away from the bears.
Tearing down camp in the morning.
Waiting several hours before it was time to hike again.
All of these things were usually done in the rain and mud.
Every hiker has to do these things day in and day out. The part that really sucked for me was the two or three restroom (tree?) visits a night. Being of advanced age (and taking a diuretic) necessitates such activities! I would have to at least partially dress and put on shoes to make these visits, typically in 30 degree evenings.
So I have an even greater appreciation for those brave souls who successfully complete the entire AT. Many overcome much greater odds than my minor inconveniences to complete their goal. I may decide to try again, but at this time it's not on the agenda. 
I would like to thank everyone for their support, kind words, and prayers. They mean a lot to me.
