Trudger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583923,"Great weather to start the day. Enjoyed hiking with my friend Stump. It was his first AT hike and also his 66th Birthday. His enthusiasm made the miles pass quickly. We met Moon and Elfie on our way to lunch at the big pond. When we got to the shelter the wind had picked up and made it impossible to setup the hammocks, so we stayed in the Spring Mountain shelter. Thankfully there was a tarp rolled up in the doorway. The wind was so strong the tarp acted like a sail and fluttered loudly. It died down later and we were able to get some sleep. Grateful we had the shelter to ourselves. Love the bear cables!","Hot Springs, NC

Trudger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583924,"Cold & windy wakeup. Broke camp @ 8:30. Had a great hike until around 4:00, when we got to the boulder field at Big Firescald Knob. Wish we would have taken the bypass trail, since we were not prepared mentally or physically for the boulder challenge that late in the day. It took us almost 3 hours to hike 1.7 miles. 20/20 hindsight - won't make that mistake again! We were struggling to make it to the shelter when Stump's pack strap came loose. Luckily Squatch was at the shelter and helped us get there. Enjoyed time with him and Guru and the fire he had going in the fireplace. Nobody slept well except Guru, who serenaded us with log sawing all night. Woke up to a steady rain, so we packed up quickly and started our hike to Devil's Fork. Based on the weather forecast (60 mph winds, sub-freezing temps) I decided to leave the trail today with Stump. I'm grateful for old age and common sense.","Spring Mountain shelter

Trudger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583927,"Woke to a steady rain and broke camp at 8:00. Squatch and Guru were taking a zero on their journey Southbound to Springer Mtn. We had slow pace due to Stump's bad knee and arrived at Flint Mountain shelter around 12:00. This is when things got very interesting.I discovered I didn't pack any food for lunch, probably because I was planning to resupply at Stump's truck and continue to Damascus, VA as was my original plan. Wonder hiked into the shelter with warm sausage biscuits and Coke. Best meal ever! He was truly a gentle soul and we believe he healed Stump's knee with a handshake. I know it sounds weird, but I witnessed the change as Stump almost ran the 2.5 miles to Devil's fork, pain free.We covered 36 miles on this hike, and greatly enjoyed each others' company, sharing a lot of laughs and a few tears. I learned a lot about what I need to do to prepare for my next section hike. I'm planning 4 or 5 weeks of hiking Northbound from Devil's Fork gap and will be sure to bring extra food and a sleeping pad in case I need to sleep in a shelter.","Jerry Cabin Shelter
