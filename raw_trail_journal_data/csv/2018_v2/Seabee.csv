Seabee,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587029,"My decision to end my thru hike was a difficult one. It caused quite a bit of angst in me the past week of my hike.  It is said that there are two major factors that will come into play on whether a thru hiker reaches his or her goal: injury (health) and the mental state (happiness and well being). While I never suffered a serious or nagging injury during my hike that was significant enough to call an end to the hike, what I did come to recognize was that I did not have the strength and physical stamina to keep hiking enjoyably day after day. When I got to Hot Springs my weight had dropped to 159 lbs from 175 when I started. I became more concerned about the longterm impact on my health the hike was having.The second and equally important factor in my decision to end my hike was my mental or state of happiness. For the most part I was hiking solo each day. While I had developed several hiking friendships (the British Couple and HILLS) it was not the same as hiking with a partner or group that shared their experiences each day. I missed the interaction with other hikers with interests similar to mine.  Both of these issues became much clearer to me after I talked to my brother and sister when I reached Hot Springs.  After some more angst, I called my brother back that evening and asked him to come pick me up the next day.  Most interestingly to me was after I made the decision I felt relieved and good about it. No regrets.","None
