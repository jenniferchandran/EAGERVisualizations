TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590251,"Today I leave my home for the adventure of a lifetime. While much of the trail brings so much excitement, it also brings along the fear of the unknown. As soon as I walked out the door of my home this morning I realized I dont know what will happen to my friends, family, or my dog while I’m gone or even if they will be here when I get back. A lot has changed the past month of my life and the trail will be teaching me how to “rest” in my faith. Rest is an active part of faith that requires one to release anxieties and circumstances that are out of a persons control. I have to learn how to be joyful with what I have in the present moments and be thankful for the past rather than to try to recreate it or turn back time as if I could make things better. Heres to the trail teaching me to become more trusting in my faith and becoming more thankful for the present opportunities in my life!",,"Demascus, VA","May 13, Sun",0
TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590940,"My first three days on the trail have been nothing but raint and every bit of gear I own is drenched. For my first few days out, it hasnt been optimal weather, but now I am well prepared for future wet days. Learning how to do “chores” while in the rain has been a learning curve but I feel pretty caught up now. I feel my trail legs starting to kick in as I now in total have done 25 miles. Though the last three days have not been necessarily rough hikes, the wetness has caused so many more problems like a 5lbs heavier pack and a couple of good blisters on the back of my feet. Tonight me and Spacebear are staying in a farmhouse and it will be nice to stay dry and will hitchhike out to Trail Days back in Demascus tomorrow to meet with some friends. Overall though there has been a lot of learning the past 3 days, it has been so rewarding to look up during a hard climb and be stunned how beautiful these mountains are. Cant wait for dryer days and for more miles in my hiking boots!","

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591749,"My trail legs are finally starting to kick in and getting used to getting up everyday and hiking in very rocky and wet terrain. Last week i had some of my first 15 mile days and it felt great. Should be getting to about 20 mile days here pretty soon. Though we had a good 2 days of dry weather, this upcoming week is nothing but thunderstorms. At least i found a good method of preventing blisters in the wet weather using a mixture of duck tape and Ktape. 3 days ago I also was given the trail name of “Duck Hole” because of how much I talk about hunting during hikes and because of my camo crocs and camo shorts. Black Bears around Thomas Knob Shelter were very active; the night I spent in the shelter there a bear tore someones foodbag and also slashed into a hikers tent while sleeping. Thankfully everyone is ok, the park now has ridge runners to help with all the bear activity around that shelter. Cant wait to get back on the trail after a warm breakfast and coffee at this gas station next to our motel!All the Best,James McCann aka Duck Hole","Marion

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592841,"the past 3 days have been a well needed zero. I got a resupply box that contained sock liners that should prevent these blisters in the bad weather ive had. The hostile we stayed at allowed a group of friends that Spacebear knew to catch up. We are headed out today as a group and so far its been a cool experienxe being a part of a “trail family”. We all come from different back grounds but have a lot of fun together. We have made a lot of games together that passes the time while we rest that all involve a frisbee, trekking poles, and beer ahah. Its been a good rest and im lookin foward to getting back to 15-20 mile days","Pearisburg, VA
