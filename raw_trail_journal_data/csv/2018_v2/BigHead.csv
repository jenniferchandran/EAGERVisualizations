BigHead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557562,"I read Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer in 1997 and I realized that for me to get anywhere near Mt Everest was a far away dream. The next year Bill Bryson released A Walk in the Woods and that kept me intrigued with the possibility of hiking the AT for several years and the since the trail-head at Springer Mountain is practically in my backyard it would be a real possibility to hike at least some of the AT one day. Then Robert Redford released the movie A Walk in the Woods in 2015 and that sparked a renewed interest in hiking the AT so last year when my son-in-laws mother said she wanted to try a section hike in Georgia I said ok let's do it! No, it's not Mt Everest but it does present a mental & physical challenge closer to home at a fraction of the cost. In fact, so much of a challenge that most thru hikers quit before making it out of Georgia. I'm committed to making it happen but I also know that I have my limitations. We'll see what I have for it when the going gets tough this May. Really looking forward to it!",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Sat",0

Guess we will have to do that another day, maybe on Thursday which is usually the day B3 and I go for a little hike at Sweetwater Creek State Park. My hope is for the weather to be better in two weeks than it has been today because it will not be a fun start to this hike getting all wet on the first day.

BigHead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562315,"My section hike of the Appalachian Trail starts next Sunday May 7 and a lot of planning and training has gone into making this a successful trip. I can say at this point that I think I am as ready as I can be for the trip. In preparation I have watched a number of You Tube hiker videos looking for information and inspiration and one of my favorite channels is by Homemade Wanderlust who is now off to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. In my opinion her videos are some of the best and even beat a lot of prime time TV shows. Best wishes to Dixie as she makes her way along the Pacific Coast Trail starting this month. 

Now for the record, I realize that my section hike pales in comparison to completing a thru hike of the AT, but I will be just as happy to have had the brief opportunity to sample a little bit of life away from all the routine bs that we all come to accept as daily life. Also, I would like to give a much deserved thanks to my wife who has been 100% supportive of this little adventure and many others over the years. I think that In the back of her mind she knows that if I come home in a bag she will be loaded!

BigHead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563635,"It was 42 degrees this morning at 6AM when we left the hotel in Dahlonega to head over to the Amnicola Falls Visitor Center falls visitor center to put our name on the trail log. One of the AT Ridge Runners weighed our bags and we were right on the average at 31 lbs. for a thru hiker. B3's bag was 29 pounds, The Mayors was 34 pounds and mine weighed 35 pounds. A little on the heavy side but about average. He also said that we were making an intelligent decision by not hiking the approach trail. As it was the hiking was pretty strenuous all day, hardly any moderate to difficult hiking like we had been practicing at Sweetwater Creek. Cardiac Hill as I called it is a piece a cake compared to the 3 mile uphill's that we endured today.
The weather was absolutely gorgeous though, perfect day for hiking and unbelievable blue skies all day through the trees made for some incredible views of nature. Couldn't find any cell service out here so that I could post anything for day one so maybe tomorrow when we climb up out of this gap 
I will be able to get some service. We called it a day and set up the tents at Hawk Mountain Shelter which is only 8.1 miles into the hike. But then you have to consider we had to hike a mile just to the start the trail so we really hiked 9.1 miles today. After we set up our tents we walked downhill to the water source which seemed like it was a mile away but probably only about a 10th of a mile. But it was pretty steep 10th of a mile and after hiking all day it seemed like forever to get back up to the tents to cook our meals, which by the way were pretty good. I had biscuits and gravy with a side of Ramen noodles. Doesn't sound like a very good combination but it was damn good!  It's 7:08 PM and I am in my tent in my sleeping bag ready to call it a day. I will let you know what happens tomorrow. Happy trails!","Springer Mountain

Campsite at 9 o'clock this morning and hiked 8.4 miles to Gooch Mtn. Shelter. It seemed like 20 miles. There was a lot of steep and rocky hiking across Hightower Gap even steeper and rockier conditions up and down on Sassafras Mountain. Several people on the trail were having difficulties and my knees were taking a beating. Glad I had on my knee braces. We are calling it a day and pitching our tents here at Gooch Mtn. Shelter so we are about 8.5 miles short of our original goal for today to be at camping Lance Creek. There's just no way that we could've made that much mileage under these conditions. Overall it was a good day reflecting on people, places and things in my life. Stay tuned!

We left Gooch Mtn. Shelter at 9:20 this morning on our way to Lance Creek, about an 8.5 mile hike. I tell you, one mountain mile seems like five. Seven hard hours later we started setting up camp here. We made several steep climbs but the best was Big Cedar Mountain. It was a brutal climb and I thought I was never going to make it. Close to the top I came across a pretty girl sitting on an old log up off the trail writing in a journal. She didn't really look like a hiker so I thought she had to be an angel. I asked her if this was heaven because you look like an angel sitting up there. She smiled and said no so I told her I would really try to do better anyway and kept going. About fifteen minutes later I finally caught up to B3 and The Mayor at Big Cedar Mountain Rock Ledges. It was a beautiful clear day and the view was breathtaking. We hung around for about ten minutes and then headed on towards Lance Creek. It was a pretty warm day and I drank about two and a half liters of water and was completely out. Just before getting to camp we came across a little waterfall and I filtered 16 ounces and drank it on the spot. I love my Grayl water filter! It's now 7:20 and we've had our dinner (I had Pho and two packs of Ramen noodles) and I am finally laying down for the night. I'm in the last camp spot where everybody hangs their bear bags so I hope Yogi and Boo Boo don't show up later.

BigHead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564003,"Day 4
We started out from Lance Creek this morning about 8:40 AM headed to Neel Gap, about 7.4 miles. The only obstacle in our path was Blood Mountain. At a height of 4,461 feet it is the highest mountain on the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail. It was all uphill for the first five hours but the payoff was the view from the top of Blood Mountain, as well as seeing the Blood Mountain Shelter, the oldest shelter on the Appalachian Trail. We had a snack, took a few pictures and started the hike down to Neel Gap. The two mile hike down was extremely difficult and I thought I was lost on two occasions. Once when the trail just ran into a wall of boulders. I turned to backtrack but decided to take a look over the top of the boulders first and sure enough, there was a white blaze on a tree, just out of eyesight from my advantage. The second time I had been going for a while without seeing a white blaze when I came across a kid with an empty water bottle. He told me he was on the Byron Reese Trail. Further investigation told me he started at Mountain Crossings, and the Byron Reese Trail links up with the Appalachian Trail. After two and a half hours I finally made it to Neel Gap and Mountain Crossings. The Mayor and B3 were waiting on the front with several others hikers that we had been running with for the past few days. It was like a big homecoming, everyone congratulating each other for making it to Neel Gap. The Mayor had already picked up my food drop that was to last me until we finished our hike on Sunday. Unfortunately I was finished today. Aside from everyone calling me sir, my knees, hip, and back were telling me it's over. They were actually telling me yesterday but I am not a very good listener. We are spending the night at Blood Mountain Cabins and B3 and The Mayor will push on tomorrow. We did get a little last minute trail magic when a fellow hiker offered to drive us the quarter mile to the cabin. It was a real blessing. So what's my takeaway? I have a much greater appreciation for fresh water, a good meal, a hot shower and a comfortable bed. I am also reminded of all the people who come and go in our lives and who were put there for reasons that are not always apparent. I also realized just how short our time is on earth and so with that in mind I'm gonna go get a pitcher or two of margaritas and share some of the time that I have left with someone I love!
Happy trails!

My next hike will probably be on a cruise ship walking from the swimming pool to the bar! Seriously, I have had so many good things in my life it would be hard for me to count them all. One thing is for sure. A phone call 46 years ago was the best thing that ever happened to me.","Lance Creek

The two extra days on the trail were good ones but they were ready to pack it up before the heavy rains hit the area. As soon as we settle down a little from this trip we will start planning the trip to finish up the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail. As for me, I am feeling much better after a few zero days and would be happy to go a few more days on the trail. Although I did not make it all the way to Unicoi Gap with B3 and The Mayor, it was really a very satisfying experience for me and I sure am glad I took the opportunity to see and do everything that came our way.

BigHead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565349,"Well, we have all had some time to rest and reflect on our adventure
and we all concluded that it was a real success! I may have been able 
to hang with B3 and The Mayor if I could have taken a zero day or two at
Neels Gap but that just did not fit into our schedule for just one week
of hiking. I am happy with me finishing at Mountain Crossings and proud
of their effort to complete another two days on the trail to Unicoi 
Gap. We were all happy with our equipment choices except The Mayor 
thinks he may try hammock camping sometime in the future. I would 
probably get a better cook pot, something with handles so that pouring 
hot water would be easier, but what I had was fine for just a week and 
$0 money spent. The freeze dried food selections were OK, and who 
doesn't like to snack on M&M's, candy bars and peanuts all day. But 
lets be honest, we all wanted a double cheese burger, fries and a large 
coke as soon as we got in the car to come home. This week we all went 
for Mexican together on Thursday night to reflect on our adventure and we 
crushed it. We had all been dreaming of margaritas, chips & salsa, 
giant burrito supreme dinners and fish tacos and finally it was all in 
front of us. There is no way to pass along all the experiences we had on
the trail, like the sound the wind makes blowing through the trees, how
just one bird singing would echo all around you and how after hiking 
for an hour how nice it was to hear the sound of a waterfall knowing we 
were about to fill up on some fresh cool water. You also see a lot of 
Appalachian Trail videos on YouTube but it is really impossible to 
convey what it is like to hike a steep incline over huge rocks and then 
have to pick your way down the other side of the mountain for two and a 
half hours only to take a little break and get ready for the next 
mountain. And at the end of the day if was pure joy to peel off all the 
gear, get out of your hiking shoes and lay down on the ground to stretch
out and relax.  It was always satisfying to know what you had done that
day and how you wished you could have shared it all with everyone you 
know, and that is why I wrote this journal. I hope you enjoyed it as
much as I did writing it and I hope you will look for the video that I
will be posting here and on YouTube in the near future.

I had a pretty good run last year until I blew out at Neels Gap but they managed another couple of days without me and finished at the GA/NC line.  I'm all rehabilitated now and look forward to getting it done in North Carolina this year. Will post again soon with section hike details but if anybody has a favorite section in North Carolina and want to make a suggestion just post a comment in my guest book section.  I see a lot of people have thru hikes planned and are starting really early this year. Just so you know, Georgia is still pretty frosty late February into April. As a matter of fact, it was still pretty chilly in May on a couple of mornings last year in Georgia so be sure to take plenty of warm layers of clothing, a good sleeping bag and maybe a snow shovel too.

BigHead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583282,"Well, last year The Mayor, B3 and I made a splash into section hiking the AT.  Those guys did a little better than me as I had to bailout at Mountain Crossings with what turned out to be a slight hernia but enough to require some surgery.  They made it a couple of days further up to the GA/NC where they celebrated and took a photo of a bag of M&M's sitting on the trail marker in my honor. For the record, I haven't had an M&M or a honey bun since last May but I expect to soon be restocking the backpack with an assortment of goodies that I usually don't get to eat around the house. Standard guitar tuning EADGBE (Eat All Day Go to Bed Early) is my backpacking mantra because I know I can burn through some of my favorite snack foods for a week and not do too much damage.  This year we have finally decided that our 2018 Appalachian Trail section hike will begin on May 5th at the Nantahala Outdoor Center heading North to Newfound Gap, TN.  It's not a long hike (roughly 70 miles) but it will be convenient in that we can park our vehicle at the NOC and it will be relatively easy to catch a shuttle back from Newfound Gap.  Starting at the NOC will offer us a few of the best highlights that the AT offers in North Carolina including the NOC itself, Cheoa Bald, Fontana Dam, Clingmans Dome and a little taste of the Great Smoky Mountains.  Again, it's not a long hike but the elevation changes are difficult with Cheoa Bald being one of the most challenging climbs on this section of the AT with over 3000 feet in ascent over 5.8 miles.  So while the length of our hike will be relatively short it will not be a cake walk. Probably need to start working on the stair climber a little harder starting now.

The top at 5,052 feet is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail. I just hope we get to the top in time to set up in dry weather and get a view of the sun setting to our west.

Ok, here is the rest of the story:
NOC to Sassafras, just a little short of our goal today. Basically hiking uphill all day and in some places straight up. I was drained and could hardly set my tent up and once it was up I was ready to skip a freeze dried cookout and go straight to bed. I finally managed to recharge enough to boil some water for my chicken teriyaki. 
I finally hit the sack around 7:30 knowing that sometime soon we would be getting some rain. Around midnight I heard the first drops hit the Tyvek rain fly. It sounded like random gunshots at first followed by a deluge of rain and lightning that lasted a little more than an hour before slowing up and blowing on through. About half way through the storm I got out my headlight to check for leaks and found there were a few at the zipper on the door. Since the tent wasn’t exactly level the runoff was going almost immediately off to the left side so 
I threw my shirt from the day on it to soak it up. It wasn’t a big leak so it worked just fine. I finally got back to sleep and woke up about 7:15 and stuck my head out. It was really cool with lots of mist and low clouds. I walked up the hill where we had hung our bear bags and brought them back to our camp and started some water for coffee and breakfast. By then B3 and The Mayor were getting up too. It was a blessing that we had stopped short of Cheoah Bald for the night.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

The worst part is having to deal with packing all this stuff up wet. No time to sit and dry out. Packed up and on our way about 9:40, kinda late for starting but took extra time packing up. Now, uphill 1.2 miles to Cheoah Bald and as we go higher up the wind is howling, maybe 30 or 40 miles per hour. Getting close to 5000 ft it is starting to clear up and I can see  fantastic views through the trees. I’m a slow poke so The Mayor and B3 are ahead of me probably already there having a snack. Last little climb and I see The Mayor so I know I’m finally there, Cheoah Bald, elevation 5052 ft. The wind had calmed down and the sky had cleared. The views were just spectacular. It would have been magical to camp here to see the sunset, stars and sunrise. We enjoyed a snack and soaked it all in. Then it was back at it. We had to make up some lost time and it was downhill for a while. Straight down! Not as fast as I had hoped. Lots of rocks and big step-downs so going down wasn’t too fast at all. We had planned to get to Hogback Gap today and then into Fontana tomorrow but that was starting to look pretty unrealistic. It was almost 4:00 and we had over four more miles to cover. I was picking my way across a big rock slide when I had a vision of how to get back on track! I just had to run it past the others first. As I was coming down into Stecoah Gap I could see The Mayor and B3 waiting in the parking area. They were enjoying snacks and water some Trail Angels had left. When I got there I told them of my vision of hitching a ride into Fontana for a zero day so that we could be ready to leave for the Smoky Mountains on schedule. They liked the idea because it wasn’t looking good for us to make it anywhere close to Hogback Gap today which meant it would be almost impossible to get to Fontana on schedule. They agreed, now all we needed was a ride. As I was floating my idea a truck had pulled into the parking lot and a gentleman stepped out and came over to us. We asked him how far it was to Fontana and he offered us a ride into town. We first stopped at the Fontana Hilton (a hiker Shelter known for its amenities) before deciding to head on to the Fontana Lodge. Two double beds, a hot shower, restaurant with pizza and beer and a breakfast you wouldn’t believe. That’s what I call taking a zero day.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

He and B3 quietly left earlier for breakfast and then B3 took all of our clothes down to the laundry. Breakfast for me was three giant pancakes, so big that I couldn’t finish them all, bacon and coffee. After that I caught up with The Mayor and B3 and we just chilled in the lobby for a while talking about what would be in store for us tomorrow in the Smoky Mountains. My drop box with more food arrived and we spent most of the rest of the afternoon drying out our stuff and repacking while watching Runaway Train.

BigHead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589929,"Woke up this morning knowing it was going to be another brutal day on the trail and I wasn't really sure if I was ready for it.  The day off at Fontana Lodge was really nice for us all.  Good food, hot shower, comfortable bed.  I could get used to this pretty quick.  After all, I am on vacation.  Around 7:45 AM B3, The Mayor and I all met for breakfast.  The day before I had three monster sized pancakes that were awesome but this morning thinking about the hike I just wasn't really that hungry.  I did want something that would be pretty light so I just ordered a small bowl of grits.  They were those good old fashioned stone ground grits and I think that they maybe could have cooked a little more to make them taste more like grits instead of sawdust.  But on a happier note, the coffee was very good.  Shoved it down and then headed to the room to get our gear so that we could meet the shuttle at 9 AM. The Fontana Lodge is almost three miles off the trail but they provide a shuttle service back and forth to the trail for just three dollars. Just before heading to the shuttle I discovered that I did not have my phone so I had to run back to the restaurant and find it.  Half way there I found it in a different pocket than I had been keeping it so I felt pretty stupid but relieved it wasn't lost.  Back at the shuttle B3, The Mayor and a little old lady who called herself Redneck Granny were waiting.  Redneck Granny was was probably pushing seventy years old and she looked like a sweet little old lady.  She had started her hike back in March at Springer Mountain so she had plenty of spunk.  The van dropped us off just before the dam about 9:20 AM and continued with Redneck Granny another two miles to the start of the trail-head entering the Great Smoky Mountains. The day was awesome and the temperature perfect for hiking and I was having visions of going back for the pancake breakfast. Once we got started it was really great hiking for about a minute and then the trail started going straight up. We started at 1,749 ft elevation and climbed 4.5 miles up to Shuckstack fire tower at 3,993 ft.  It was around 1:00 PM so we were ready to stop for a break. The Mayor had been there there well ahead us and had already hiked the extra tenth of a mile to the tower and back.  He climbed to the top and said it was amazing up there.  I told him I would take his word for it and would look at his pictures later.  He did shoot some really great pictures of Fontana Lake and the surrounding area. Just before getting to the fire tower I passed Redneck Granny moving really slow. I asked her if she was ok and she just nodded so I kept on going. She had been hiking since March, all the way from Springer Mountain.  I will never forget the far away look on here face when I passed her. No way she was going to make it to Mollies Ridge Shelter today.  Now back on our way now and the trail is still going up. We hiked another two hours, mostly uphill to Gregory Bald at 4,422 ft and then took another break around 4:40 PM.  At that point I was pretty tired and wondering if I was going to make the 3.2 miles from there to Mollies Ridge Shelter.  After about another hour hiking uphill I started wondering what the hell was I doing here at all but around 6:00 PM I finally saw the shelter.  I was completely trashed so I laid down for a while before eating and when I did it was just a snack and then back in the sack.

Actually, I am never the first up.  I slept good and really needed to because it will be a hard ten mile hike from here to Derricks Knob Shelter today.  We all grabbed some breakfast, packed up and were on the trail by 8:40 AM.  Nice start to the day, cool and a mostly downhill run for about three miles.  We all stopped around 11:00 AM for a short break and then headed out again.  Over the next 4.5 miles it would be a long uphill 1,200 ft climb to Rocky Top.  About two hours in I was starting to hit a wall and I started counting my steps one to one hundred and then starting over again.  It’s a beautiful day, and when I have a moment to look up the views are amazing.  Then it’s back to hiking, one, two, three, four on and on until I have to stop and recharge.

It’s getting harder not to think about the five additional miles it will be to get to camp after we make it to the top of Rocky Top.  One, two, three, four, and wondering how the hell I was going to get out of this one.  Finally at 2:25 PM I made it to the top. The Mayor and B3 were ready enjoying the view.  I crashed on the rocks for a minute or two before getting up to look around.  As you might expect, Rocky Top has a small rocky top that allows you to see 360 degrees of breathtaking views.  It was worth all the effort and I took a moment to thank God for the opportunity to be there, and I also asked for forgiveness for all the nasty things I had said getting there.  Break-time was over and at 2:40 PM we were back to hiking a short downhill and quick climb on Thunderhead Mountain that topped out at 5,520 ft elevation.  The downhill off Thunderhead Mountain was steep and slow to Beechnut Gap at 4,930 ft where I looked back to see Rocky Top and Thunderhead towering above.  Now it was 4:20 PM and at this rate I wasn’t going to make camp before dark. Nothing to do but keep pushing along but I was really kicking myself for biting off such a big bite of trail for one day.  Now I’m counting again, but it’s only to fifty before stopping to lean over and look at my feet.  What next?  Hike, one, two, three, four, keep moving. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. I’ve told my guys for years you can’t eat the elephant all at once, just do it a bite at a time. That’s what I needed to do so back to it.  One, two, three.  Yeah, I’m in trouble here. It’s late, my leg is killing me, it’s 6:00 PM now with 1.5 miles to go.  Finally, 7:15 PM I can see Derricks Knob Shelter.  I’m completely zonked.  I threw my stuff down and just sat for a while before having enough energy to eat a pack of crackers.  hen it was straight to bed.  Not the day I had in mind when we set out this morning but glad to finally be here where I could lay down.","Mollies

BigHead,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590382,"Cliffsnotes for today’s journal:Got up early, hiked my ass off, finished at Clingmans Dome.  Went home, slept in my bed.
Slept good last night and actually I don’t feel as bad as I had expected. Yesterday my right thigh area was burning pretty bad at the end of the day but this morning it’s not too bad. The Mayor brought me a cup of coffee and asked how I was doing. “Ok” was as much an answer as I could give.  B3 was already getting packed up so I proceeded to do the same. We hiked out about 8:00 AM and did not get far before hearing a big clap of thunder. The Mayor and I looked back towards the shelter and there was a big dark cloud coming over the top of the mountain. We put on our Frogg Toggs and were back on our way.  The rain never came and that poncho started to get really warm.  I hiked with it as far as I could and then I had to get out of it.  I was burning up and my leg was starting to hurt again. Today on a scale of one to ten I was hitting about a nine and it was only 10 o’clock. It was going to be a long long day at this rate. Around 10:15 AM I came up on The Mayer and we took off our ponchos.  I must have looked pretty bad because he told me to take off my pack. Then he put it on with his and hiked for almost 2.5 miles until we took another break at Silers Bald Shelter.  Even without my pack he left me in his dust. That guy is monster strong and really bailed me out.  At the next shelter we went through my pack in an effort to lightened it up. There were a couple of other hikers there taking breaks and they were happy to get some of the food I knew I would not be eating before we finished.  The Mayor and B3 were both pulling gear to help lighten up my bag as well. Time to go again, I put my lightened pack on and got back to hiking.  Clingmans Dome was 4.5 miles further out and Double Gap Shelter was only 1.5 miles.  I just wanted to make it there and I did in pretty good time but I was ready for a break.  When I finally hiked in I got something of an ovation from everyone that wad there and that made me feel pretty good.  But we weren’t staying here.  This close to the end The Mayor was determined more than ever to push through the 2.8 miles to Clingmans Dome so that we could sleep in our own beds tonight.  It was 3:00 PM and we were just about ready to start out again and it started raining. Not just a little shower, really hard downpour and then a big flash of lightning hit that made everyone jump. A dark cloud came over the hill from behind us just that quick. I went inside the shelter to stay dry.  A couple of other hikers that had been caught on the trail came running in to dry off. I wasn’t sitting there very long when another hiker came in asked me if I was going with my buddies. I said yeah when it quits raining and he said well they’re getting really go. I stuck my head out, the rain still pouring down and I see The Mayor and B3 both putting on their rain gear. I told them they had to be kidding and I said I wasn’t going anywhere until it slowed up or stopped. And just like that the rain stopped. The Mayor laughed and said “ok, it stopped, let go!”  We weren’t sure if we wouldn’t get another round or not but now I had to start putting on my poncho and get ready to go.  The 2.8 miles to Clingmans Dome would be all uphill, 5487 ft to 6612 ft elevation.  For me, it was about to be an epic battle with a mountain.  I knew I was going to win but I didn’t know how long it was going take.  The Mayor headed out followed by B3 and I was bringing up the rear. Slow and easy trying to keep a steady pace.  Occasionally I could see B3 about a hundred feet ahead of me so I thought I had to be doing OK.  Finally, about 1 mile from the top I stopped to take a break, and B3 leaned out of the bushes ahead of me and surprised me. She had stopped to take a break as well and was checking for a cell signal. No service!  All day long no service.  We were pretty sure that The Mayor was probably already on top of Clingmans Dome looking for us so we moved along at a snails pace.  There was no end to the big rock steps that kept leading us higher and higher.  It was 4:45 PM and occasionally clouds would blow across the trail. A couple of hikers coming down told us we could cut off some time by taking the fork to the Clingman Dome parking lot.  When we arrived at the fork it would be a half mile more of straight uphill climbing or a nice path that led slightly downhill.  We took the downhill without hesitation and we picked up a cell signal and got in touch with the mayor who came down to the parking lot to meet us.  Finally, at 6:15 PM we were in the parking lot.  Clingmans Dome is not just a hiker destination, it is also a very popular tourist destination for people from all over the world.  Well dressed tourist families speaking in there own language were witnessing our arrival where we literally laid down in the parking lot.  I know I surely looked like death and I saw a lady sneak a photo and turn away quickly.  Although I didn’t really understand what a mother was telling her child, (Isabella, aléjate de esas personas!) I knew from the inflection in her voice that she was warning little Isabella to stay away from those people.  I’m sure we looked like the people her embassy had warned her about.  We did finally reach the shuttle driver but it would be an hour and a half before he could pick us up. We all just wrapped up in our ponchos and laid down on the parking lot to wait.  I think I know how the homeless feel now.  People see you and they know you are there but they don’t want to acknowledge you because they are afraid that if they did you might ask them for something.  All I wanted was my ride which finally arrived at 8:15 PM.  Finally, we were on our way home.  The shuttle dropped us off at the NOC around 9:00 PM where we had parked The Mayors truck last Saturday morning and it would be another three hours to drive home.  I opened the door to my house around 12:30 AM Friday morning and went straight to the shower and then to bed.  Now that’s the whole story.  Final thoughts to follow in another post.","Derricks Knob Shelter
