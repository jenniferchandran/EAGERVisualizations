Mariposa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582516,"I cannot believe that some 4 weeks after making my decision to thru-hike in 2018, here I am in Harper's Ferry, WV to test out a section of the Appalachian Trail. Just getting here gives me hope beyond measure. For those who don't me I'm a horrible traveler. Flying is something I just started experimenting with earlier this year (and by experimenting I mean once) after an almost 10-year hiatus. This was also my first time on a subway, though it didn't go quite as smoothly. Got a little lost in transit and my 10-minute Metro ride wound up taking nearly an hour and a half. Still, had plenty of time to catch my Amtrak ride (another first), which I loved. 
By 7:30 a.m. I was crossing the Shenandoah River and heading towards my first white blaze. By 8:00 a.m. I had nearly lost a water bottle and rolled my ankle. It was a hard reality for this Midwesterner on the A.T.; all the training in the world couldn't have quite prepared me for the rocky terrain and elevations here. The ascents in the first mile alone were pretty brutal for a girl raised in the second-largest corn producing state, and I found myself scrambling to make the mental shift. But that's exactly why I'm here: to bring home successes and learn from failures. 
Moments later I stumbled across my first SOBO thru-hiker, Lost Cookie. Friendly young guy, about Brent's age. He introduced me to my first trail-provided food, a pawpaw. I'm guessing it's kind of the manna of the region, and he admitted to subsisting on about 20 the previous day. When he passed one my way I was skeptical but didn't want to offend him. Similar to a fig in texture but very earthy. Hopefully, I won't have to rely on them but nice to know in a pinch.
About 8.4 miles in I stopped at the David Lesser shelter for lunch. Beautiful day to kick off my shoes and enjoy the swing before continuing south another 3.4 miles to the Blackburn shelter. After setting up my tent, I ate alongside a few other young SOBOs who were kind enough to show me how to hang my bag on the bear pole, as well as share with me some of the finer trail etiquette like how to properly spray toothpaste on shrubs. Though this advice came from the same guy who sleeps with his food in his sleeping bag each night because one of his friends told him his human scent would mask the scent of food from the bears. Oh boy, I'm going to have a lot to sift through.
Dusk came none too soon at 7:30 p.m. and it was lights out for all.",,View Entry,"Sep 14, Thu",0
Mariposa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582574,"Early to bed, early to rise. Watching the sunrise from my tent was out of this world and really invigorated my spirits. I was eager to embrace my morning routine, but admit to struggling with just how to organize that routine. So I guess this is as good a time as any for another admission: my pre-Appalachian backpacking experience is less than 7 days. And if you take out the time camping in my own backyard that number drops to 5. Although, let me add that the first night in my backyard was the scariest. Within the first hour I was awakened by a pack of very-nearby and exceptionally excited coyotes; three hours later my arm became the snuggle center for a large rodent (thankfully on the other side of the tent wall). Incidentally, I was in the comforts of my own bed by 2:30 a.m.  But I don’t want that lack of practical know-how to overshadow my ambition and sheer romanticism of completing a thru-hike. So onward I go towards figuring this out. That being said, I still couldn’t believe it was 8:30 a.m. before I finally left camp. Tomorrow will be better. 
The ankle I rolled yesterday was still angry, but by the time I ascended my first pass a shot of adrenaline and edema kicked in and I was feeling good. Today I began the infamous Roller Coaster. It’s a 13.5-mile section with 10 significant climbs. It’s rocky and gives that honest reminder that I’ve got some serious training to work through in the offseason. I passed several thru-hikers and day hikers, or more accurately they passed me. It’s only my second day out here yet I can already distinguish the day hikers by smell. Pure detergent. I wonder if they’re categorizing my smell, too? It’s quickly accepted that section and thru-hikers don’t use deodorant. When everything you plan to possess is carried on your back, very early on the difference between success and failure hinges on a plethora of small decisions. It’s one of the conundrums that fascinates me. I love a good puzzle. 
I arrived at the Bears Den hostel mid-afternoon. Bears Den is one of those beloved hostels, a must-stay, A+ ranked by many hikers. Truth, I was planning to enjoy the solitude of a tent site in their beautiful backyard and pay for some needed add-on services, mainly a shower and laundry. I wasn’t quite sure how I felt about hostels. When the proprietor spotted me and invited me inside it was like a piece of heaven. I happily grabbed a bunk with a slim mattress, full-sized pillow, shower with warm water, shampoo AND towels, and an electric outlet to charge my phone. I gotta say, that shower was pure bliss. Afterwards, I picked up my first-ever mail drop and scored a couple granola bars (vegan, can you believe that!) from the hostel’s small re-supply. One I planned to bring home for Walter but I had no idea how hard hiker hunger bears down after only two days. Oh, the food thing’s gonna be a challenge.",,View Entry,"Sep 15, Fri",0
Mariposa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582581,"I broke habit and lazily enjoyed some extra time in my comfy bunk. Jeez, only one night and I’m a total hostel convert. I was back on trail at 8:15 a.m. heading NOBO on my return trip towards Blackburn. Another day of sun-filled skies with temps stretching into the 80’s. The Roller Coaster seemed easier my second time through and gave me great confidence. More time to enjoy my surroundings, the sights, the sounds (I’m such a bird lover), the smells. Three miles north I took a long break, taking in the never-ending views at Raven Rocks. 
This afternoon I heard my first bear story. Met a section hiker just returning from a two-week detour. His tent and other belongings were destroyed by a hungry bear on its quest to satiate a sweet tooth. While the hiker sat down to breakfast, a black bear rummaged voraciously through his tent for what turned out to be a Snicker’s wrapper. Yep, it was just a wrapper that he neglected to bag the night before. The bear was still rifling through his tent when he returned and it took some effort to shoo him away. Anyway, he was heartbroken. He retold his story with shredded shelter in hand to the clerk at the nearest REI. Bless their souls, they replaced his belongings for free. Lessons learned: (1) Nothing, not toothpaste, soap, nor candy wrapper stays in shelter, (2) the kid sleeping with his food two nights ago has a death wish, and (3) I’m an REI customer for life.",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Sat",0
Mariposa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583228,"T-49 and I'm already walking among the sleepless. Yeah, I'm excited alright, but boy do I feel overwhelmed some days. Time keeps ticking and no matter how many items I check off my to-do list it keeps growing and GROWING. Good news is I now have 180 days of dehydrated baby wipes. My latest challenge has been food. This week's test kitchen has focused on two key ingredients: oatmeal and couscous. And after 7 days of experimenting I can (unequivocally) say I'm tired of both. Meal planning has been especially difficult since I opted to backpack stoveless AND I'm meat/dairy free. Since I'm not quite ready to live on ProBars and GoMarcro bars alone, next week I plan to liven things up a bit with ramen.  Anyway, my trekking poles got a fresh wrapping of duct tape today and I've also filled 6 months worth of 0.5 oz soap bottles. I'm becoming quite the gram weenie these days but pack weight is among my top fears. Now I've got to decide about that tetanus shot.
But yes, I am very excited and love jumping through all these hoops. I mean, there's this amazing journey on the horizon and my mind is galloping while my heart smiles. Can't wait to not sleep tonight.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Thu",0
Mariposa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583655,"T-38 and I'm all adrenaline. It's been great for training, since getting outdoors is the only surefire way to keep me focused and grounded. The miles are coming easier but nothing in Illinois can truly prepare me for the AT. I'm always overly careful not to develop false confidence. But hey, look at the beautiful boy I spotted today. Better stated, he spotted me. I was head-down on a hill while he watched me crest -- right off trail. Anyway, those are the moments that center me while I package my meals and plan for my husband's survival when I'm gone. He'll do fine, of course, I'm just used to trying to make life easier for him. In the meantime, I love reading all the journals here. So much enthusiasm, anxiety, excitement and hope. It's a present reminder that we're all intertwined in this journey and I can't wait to be out there with you all. Till next time, Happy Trails.",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Mon",0
