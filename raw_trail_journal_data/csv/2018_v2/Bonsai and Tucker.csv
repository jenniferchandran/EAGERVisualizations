Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551832,"So, Tucker has finally retired and we have decided that it was time to fulfill Bonsai's bucket list item of hiking the Appalachian trail. We hope to complete the entire trail in 2017, starting the end of April. God willing, and the creek don't rise, we will finish before mid October. We know it will be a tough task, but we are up for the challenge! It will be physically and mentally challenging. Those of you who know Tucker know that that is his specialty! We will try to keep you all informed at least once a week. Depends on when we can get to town to charge the cell phone and when we have a signal to transmit.",,View Entry,"Nov 26, Sat",0

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551883,"Last night we were at a dance, and talked to someone we have recently met who thru hiked the AT in two week segments. He finished back in 1998 (I think that's what he said). We asked him questions about resupply, what he did with his food to protect it from bears and mice, and such. He said he just put his food in his sleeping bag stuff sack and hung in on the shelter hanger that had a tin can on it to keep the mice out. I'm thinking we will need a better method than that with all the current bear issues and reading others' blogs about mice eating into their food supply. It's one of my biggest concerns, followed by keeping our sleeping bags and clothes dry. When we registered (volunteer thru hiker registration), they were suggesting using a bear canister for the entire trail because of all the bear activity. That's the best way to protect your food, but, geez, that adds almost three pounds to your gear weight. We do have one, but with thru hiking, we would each need to carry one to have enough room for all the food we would need to carry to resupply only once a week (at least that is the plan right now). I don't know if I want that extra weight, but I also don't want critters eating my food!",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Sun",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552047,"So, we were talking the other night about our upcoming hike, and were kind of doing a mental inventory of what we all ready have and what we still need. We got talking about the tent. We have an REI Passage 2, which is a great tent and worked great for our past backpacking. I was talking about how cramped it could be if we stayed in it for any longer than necessary to sleep, and that it is a little heavy, so Tucker asked what the options were. Well, I just happened to be looking at some websites with backpacking gear, and someone was selling the Big Agnes Fly Creek UL3 for a really great price. It's quite a bit lighter than our tent and it's got more room. So, I guess we're getting a new tent! I think we will really be happy about that once we are on the trail and have that extra little bit of room at night.
We have just over four months to go! Still need a few more items. I think it's getting close to the time to get everything out, spread it out, and make sure we have everything we need and make a list of what we still need to get. I'm getting excited!",,View Entry,"Dec 02, Fri",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552413,"Ok, I want to talk about something sensitive...gasp! Underwear. When I read articles and blogs about underwear, the guys are touting boxer briefs that are synthetic. Women have very little to choose from. I'm sure the ex-officio briefs are good, but, how can they prevent chaffing? I did buy a couple pair of them and tried them out. I have to say, they do NOT cut back on smell. And no way do they prevent chaffing. I really want to wear what is best for me during hiking. How many women have tried men's boxer briefs to prevent chaffing? Do they cut back on odor? I want what is best for my...um...private parts. I need something that breathes and prevents chaffing. Does anyone have any suggestions? I would really appreciate it!",,underwear?,"Dec 12, Mon",0

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552822,"Today is the first day of the year. We've been getting nervous and excited about our trek on the Appalachian Trail! It's getting about time to start planning in earnest. We are waiting for our 2017 AT guide, which should be sent to us around the middle of this month. When we get that, I will start making definite plans for some mail drops at towns near the trail for the first bit of our trip. I know I can't plan the entire thing because things change as you go. You never can know for sure how fast or slow you will be going and exactly when you will arrive at a certain town or landmark. I know it will be slow going at the beginning. I know that we are planning to stop once a week for resupply and not planning any zero days in town. For family and friends that don't know what a zero day is, it's when you take an entire day to stay in town and don't hike at all that day. Usually you stay one or two nights in a hotel at the same time. We are planning not to do that. We want to keep moving forward to our goal, to finish the entire trail this summer. We most likely might have to stay in a hotel once in a while, so we can charge the cell phone and our battery back up charger. We can only get three charges out of it, but plan to only use the cell phone to post on this journal about once a week, when I have a signal and for taking some pictures along the way.",,Happy New Year!,"Jan 01, Sun",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552890,"Do we need dry bags? I've heard others say they just used a compactor bag inside their backpacks to keep everything dry. So, if we do that, do we need dry bags for the sleeping bag, clothes, etc? Can you all let us know what is the best thing to keep our sleeping bags, sleeping clothes, etc dry? I really want to keep everything dry, but don't want to carry a lot of extra weight. And then, if we should have dry bags, what brand do you recommend? There are so many!",,dry bags?,"Jan 03, Tue",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554402,"So, we have just over two months to go before heading out on the trail. I'm getting pretty excited! Today I started going through some of our gear, and getting our first aid kit together. I plan to test out our cook system...still deciding weather to bring our canister stove or our home made alcohol stove. Tucker thinks we should just bring the alcohol stove made of a soda can. I don't know. Over the next few days I plan to test them both and see what seems to make more sense. I'm not really sure how available canister stove fuel will be, but stuff for the alcohol stove should be available at gas stations, Walmart, the dollar store, etc. Any opinions? I thought it was kind of fun making the soda can stove, but it seems the other stove would be so easy to use, though the canister stays kind of heavy even as you use up the gas. So many decisions to make!!!",,stoves,"Feb 09, Thu",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555096,"Our start date is coming up soon! Can't wait! I've started planning some food for the first few weeks. We are thinking of mail drops for about the first month, until we get things figured out. So, our main concern at the moment is whether to carry a bear canister or just hang a bag. I've been watching lots of blogs/vlogs, and people don't talk about that a lot, but it appears that most people just use a bag and hang it overnight. We're concerned about bears, for sure, but also about rodents and such. A bear canister helps protect from all of those, and can be used as a camp seat, and you don't have to hang it (except in the Smokey Mountain National Park). The down side is that it is very heavy (an extra 2 1/2 to 3 pounds without food) which is a real downer, and that it takes up the same amount of space in your pack whether it's full or empty. A bag is lighter, but needs to be hung at night, and is more susceptible to rodents, raccoons, bugs, etc.
So, if anyone has an opinion about this subject, we would appreciate your input! We haven't invested in either method yet, but need to start planning for that soon. We'd like to hear what you have to say on the subject!

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555148,"Ok, here's another thing for you guys to weigh in on...bear spray. Tucker thinks we should carry it. I'm not so sure because, well, it's more weight...and I haven't read any blogs that say anyone has had to use it. What do ya'll think about carrying it? I mean, it's a good idea if you have to use it...but how often does that happen? Of course, we could be that one time...!!! I don't mind carrying the extra weight if it's something that there's a chance we might need it. And, I've had someone tell me that regular people mace has more active ingredients in it than the bear mace has. Of course the bear mace has a longer range. I'm thinking the 25 to 35 feet the bear spray sprays is better than the 10 feet that people mace does! Who wants to let a bear get that close?!?!? So, weigh in, people! What do you think?
Today we went and got Tucker some Columbia hiking pants with the zip off legs. I have something similar that I love, and he said they were awesome. Let's see, what else...Oh, we got him a platypus bladder for his pack. We've been hearing that the water sources are a bit lean this year because of the drought last year, so we want to be able to carry a bit more water than the normal 2 one liter bottles that most hikers carry usually. I think that's about it for now!",,Bear mace,"Feb 25, Sat",0

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555774,"Ok, so today I did a dry run pack up. I put everything in my pack, or, attempted to. We originally were hoping to put 7 to 10 days of food in at a time, but, that ""ain't"" gonna happen...What WAS I thinking???? That's a LOT of food! Anyway, I put seven days of food in the bear vault, and that darn thing takes up a ton of space. Tucker is for sure carrying one, but I have decided I am getting an Ursack for my food. At least it gets littler as I use up food. It will be a tight fit when I have a full load, but each day will get lighter. I did get everything into my pack, and it weighed around 30 pounds (including food in Tucker's bear vault), without water. Switching from the bear vault to the Ursack will save me two pounds. I also went through and got rid of a few things to lighten it up a little more. 
Now, another question to my fellow hikers. Water bladder (platypus), or water bottles? I know the water sources are a bit more scarce this year with the drought last year and this year. We both have platypuses (I have a 2 liter, Tucker has a 3 liter) and we were thinking of using them plus a liter bottle or two as needed. I'm wondering how we will get the bladders full when the pack is so full...We each have an Osprey pack that has the water pocket between the pack and the harness... Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!",,"Hmmm, where am i gonna put that?","Mar 06, Mon",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556249,"I've been reading journals and watching vlogs for several people that are on the trail now, (as I did last year), and many are saying Verizon gets signals more on the trail than AT&T. We have U.S. Cellular. Has anyone taken their service on the trail? They advertise that they get signals ""even way out here!"" I've had their service for as long as I can remember, but, no one gets everywhere! 
As for my pack weight, Tucker and I packed both of our packs to check weight after redistributing and rethinking things, and my weight is down to 26.8 pounds without water. I'm happy with that. We had a budget for equipment, so couldn't spend the ""big bucks"" to get the really lightweight stuff, so there's no way we can get much lighter. Tucker decided that since food weighs the most he will carry the food for both of us, and I will carry the tent and a few of his little things. He says it's only fair, since he is so much bigger (heavier) than me. So, that makes his pack almost 40 pounds to start (with seven days of food, and without water) but then it will decrease by about 3 pounds a day as we use food. And he most likely won't be carrying seven days of food too often.
One thing that this little session has done that I appreciate...the room that we have our gear in no longer looks like an explosion went off in there! We had gear strewn everywhere for quite some time, and with packing the packs, it got lots more organized! 
The excitement is mounting!",,Can you hear me now?,"Mar 13, Mon",0

I suspect we ARE somewhat crazy, and, we definitely will need the luck! But seriously, we appreciate all the well wishes, humor, moral support, etc. We definitely will try to post as often as possible when on the trail to keep you up to date on where we are and how we are doing.

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558441,"I haven't had much to write about lately, just been getting things done around the house and yard. But, I just had to write an entry today because I decided to try to hang a bear bag...just for practice to see if I could do it. Tucker is out of town, and the neighbors were all gone (at least I didn't see any out and about), so I felt fairly comfortable that I would not look like a fool to anyone other than myself! So, I got my cord, a little bag to put a rock in to get the cord over a branch, and I used my sleeping bag as the bear bag just to have something to hang. Luckily we have LOTS of trees on our property, and I found one with a branch about 20 feet off the ground. I tied my little bag with the rock in it on the cord, stepped on the other end (smart! so it wouldn't fly up in the tree too!) and coiled the cord on the ground. I swung the rock bag underhand, and it went right over the branch the way I wanted it to!!! Woo hoo! First try! I finished hanging the bag, then took everything back down and did it again to make sure it wasn't a fluke that I got it on the first try. So, second try...I only had to throw it twice to get it over the branch! Good enough for me! Woo hoo!!! Bonsai",,hanging a bear bag,"Apr 01, Sat",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559977,"Ok. We are only two weeks out from our launch date. Easter weekend is coming, and I'm excited that my son is coming to visit for the weekend. I haven't seen him in quite some time, and it will be great to catch up. He's coming from Wisconsin (we're in Tennessee) and he has never been here, so is looking forward to seeing our new home and just chilling with us. We have a good weekend planned. He doesn't want to do much, but wants to have some good southern BBQ (which we will do Friday), and then we will BBQ in the back yard Saturday night and have Grandma and Grandpa over so he can visit with them. It's also Tucker's birthday Saturday, so we will have something really yummy. After my son leaves on Sunday night, we will have a week and a half to decide for sure what we will and won't bring on the trail at the beginning, pack and repack the packs to see what way we need to put things in to work best for us, and to set up the tent a few more times for practice. Is it too much for us to hope that we don't get any rain for the first few days so we can get into a routine at camp before fighting the rains? Please?!?!?!Happy Easter, everyone!",,Two weeks,"Apr 13, Thu",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560866,"Wow, only one more week before we hit the trail! I spent the last couple of days spraying our gear with permethrin (I don't want to give the ticks a chance!). I also made a home made stove out of an aluminum water bottle. I have made them from soda cans in the past, but saw a video on how to make this one, and just had to try it. I had a spare bottle so it didn't cost me anything. After I made the stove, I tested it. Worked just awesome. So, now we have a good, sturdy backup stove if something should happen to our snowpeak stove, or if we can't get canister gas.
I just got over a sinus infection, and now have some other something like a bad cold. Tucker had it about two weeks ago...thanks for sharing it with me...not! I'm hoping it is done before we leave next week, but, I usually take about two weeks to get over a cold normally. Yuck. Well, I'll keep my fingers crossed. It's not going to stop us from leaving on time!",,One more week,"Apr 19, Wed",0
Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561554,"So, we only have a few more days before we leave, and I've been watching the weather. We were hoping for a few dry days at the beginning of our hike so we could get into some routine for setup and teardown of our tent and such before getting wet. Well, it's not to be! We are expecting LOTS of rain on our first day out, with a chance for rain almost daily for the first week or two. Yuck. Well, we do have a few days for the weather to change...hope, hope!!!! But, seriously, I guess we'll take what we get and be happy with it, or, at least deal with it. One day at a time, one step at a time. And, like they say, ""no rain, no Maine!"" I guess I'd rather get wet than deal with an angry or hungry bear on the trail!
Once again, I would like to thank everyone that is following us so far, even though we haven't even started yet! I have been promising to post about once a week, but am hoping to do more often than that if we have a signal and battery power to do so. So many of you have been telling us you are going to follow our journey and wishing us luck. We really do appreciate your moral support. It will come in mighty handy when we are trudging through the rain!

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563007,"It was raining when we started at Springer Mountain, and it drizzled most of the day.  We stopped at Hawk Mountain Shelter to make lunch, where we met Soul Keeper.  We enjoyed talking to her while we were preparing lunch, and it was interesting hearing how she is doing the AT in sections over several years. We saw lots of wild flowers along the trail all day, and the fragrance was so strong and awesome!  About lunch time, Bonsai's left knee started giving her some pain, making the going a lot slower.  But, we pushed on to the top of Sassafras Mountain and set up a stealth camp site.  Took some ibuprofen in hopes of a better, more pain-free day tomorrow.  Yay, day one behind us!","Springer Mountain

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563198,"Day two was difficult for Bonsai because her knee was hurting all day.  The downs of the mountains are hard on the knees!  She was a bit perplexed because she had never had any knee problems, and, walking with one sore knee all day...you guessed it...made the other knee sore, too!  We only had one big mountain to climb, Justus Mountain, and then a bunch of little ones all day. It was a bit misty all morning.   At the bottom of Justus mountain, we stopped at Justus creek to filter and fill our water.  We each are using platypus bladders, Bonsai a 2 liter, and Tucker a 3 liter, which we really can't fill all the way because they will not hold that much with the packs full.  So, we each also carry another liter bottle in a side pocket of the pack.  With all the rain lately, there was enough water in the streams and springs that we had passed yesterday, but today Justus creek was the only water we had found so far.  We stopped to cook lunch at Gooch Mountain Shelter, where we met Chef, Cat Man, and Jim.  Chef gave us our first trail magic, as I told him about how hard the downs were on my knees, and he had found a knee brace and offered it to me to use since he didn't need it.  And, wouldn't you know, it was the right size!  Awesome!  Tucker noticed Chef was wearing a Wisconsin Badgers hat, and when he commented that we had moved recently from Wisconsin, Chef asked if we were Packer fans, and pulled a Packer jacket from his pack!  He is originally from Wisconsin himself!  How cool!  Cat Man was a young man hiking the trail with his cat riding most of the way on his shoulders.  Jim was a quiet, contemplative man from New Jersey.  It was a nice visit, but, we had to get back on the trail!  The rest of the day was nice, partly sunny, and about 70 degrees.  Bonsai thought the knee brace was helping a little as we hiked.  By the time we reached Ramrock Mountain, we were tired, sore, and both of Bonsai's knees were hurting, so we looked for a stealth site and set up for the night.","Stealth camp Sassafras Mountain

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563276,"After we settled in our tent last night and were getting ready to fall asleep, a big group of 17 boy scouts and chaperones came in and set up their tents all around us in our tiny camp area.  It was dark, so they were flashing their flashlights around, talking loudly, making rude remarks, etc.  Bonsai wanted to say something to them, but Tucker said to be patient.  Something hard for her to do!  So, after about an hour, one of the leaders finally told them to quiet down because there were other campers in their midst.  Well, duh!  They took it down to a dull roar, so we were finally able to go to sleep.  For those of you that don't know, hiker midnight is when it gets dark outside.  Most hikers have put in a long day and are ready to fall asleep by dark, and usually if in a group, everyone is quiet by then.  Anyway, the next morning while they were making their breakfast, we packed up and hiked down the trail.  I don't remember where we stopped for lunch, I know we were up high and stopped near a stealth camp spot and sat on a big rock.  Bonsai's knee was killing her (not to mention a few blisters, too), so she sat on the rock with her leg elevated, and cooked lunch.  She was feeling very discouraged with the pain and Tucker telling her she was going so slow.  Another hiker came along and asked if everything was ok.  Bonsai just said, ""Knee pain"" and the other hiker said that many people suffer from that out here because they are not able to walk their normal gait and that the terrain makes so much stress on the knees.  After that, Bonsai tried to walk with as close to a normal step as possible (though it was shorter steps because of the unevenness of the ground and all the rocks and roots).  It seemed to help a little.   During lunch Tucker spilled some food on his pants, so the first spring we came to he washed his pant leg off while Bonsai walked ahead.  She got to walk alone for about a half hour or so, which was very pleasant to walk her own pace and relax with her own thoughts.  She just let thoughts go through her head and had a nice time.  At a stealth camp site up the trail, she ran into New Jersey Jim and exchanged pleasantries, and continued on.  After Tucker caught up, a couple of men in front of us pointed out a big owl in a tree.  Very cool!  Then we got to Blood Mountain.  Wow, that was a long, tough climb.  Not just because the weather was hot, humid, and sunny, but because it was a long climb up over big rocks, roots, ruts, etc.  As we reached the summit, we saw the Blood Mountain Shelter.  It's a small two room shelter made of big stone with two window openings in each room and a door opening (no doors or windows).  The wind was picking up, and it was supposed to rain hard tonight.  There were several younger people around the shelter area, but no one had put there gear in the shelter yet, hoping it wouldn't rain so they could sleep out under the stars.  We went into the shelter, and there was one man in the back room, Paul, cooking his dinner.  We looked around and asked if he was going to stay in the back part of the shelter.  He said he was, and pointed under one of the windows and said that was where he wanted to sleep, so we set up our sleeping bags and gear between the other window and a corner.  Bonsai had heard from reading posts on other blogs and from YouTube videos that people don't like to sleep in the back room of this shelter because it is spooky.  We thought it was ok, but as the weather started getting nasty, the others came in, peeked into the back of the shelter, and stayed in the front room.  We had plenty of room, but they all still stayed in the front.  As it got dark and everyone settled in, the wind picked up and it poured, hailed, and poured some more.  The wind and rain came right in the window on top of Paul!  But he was a trooper and stayed right there!  He did have a tarp under him, a blanket over him, and pulled the other half of the tarp over the top of himself.  We got a light misty spray over us but not bad enough to make our sleeping bags wet.  During the night I woke a couple of times hearing the mice squeeking and Paul shooing them away from him, but we were never bothered.  In the morning, we were the first to wake up and start packing up.  We were pretty much packed up and I was heading to the privy (I don't think I have mentioned them yet.  Others we saw were disgusting, but this one was rather clean and not as smelly because they used mulch composting) and others were finally getting up.","Ramrock Mountain area stealth camp

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563377,"This morning at Blood Mountain Shelter, as others were packing their gear, we headed out into the dreary, misty, foggy day.  As we went down the mountain, it was just as difficult as the climb yesterday.  Lots of rocks, roots, and slippery spots from the rain and mud.  We couldn't believe the number of people day hiking up the mountain in this kind of weather, but, I guess if it is a plan for a certain day of vacation, you do what you have to do!  We didn't have breakfast before heading out this morning, so we stopped after a while and had some granola bars, then kept hiking.  We decided to not stop to cook lunch, since we were going to stop at Neel Gap (an outfitter on the trail) to take a shower and grab something to eat.  We also needed athletic tape to fix Bonsai's blisters, as bandaids just don't help, they don't stay on.  Anyway, when we got to Neel Gap, we asked about showers and were told we could not shower unless we were staying there because they were having issues with their well.  OH, NO!!!  We were looking forward to getting somewhat clean, we could hardly stand the smell of each other!  But, whatcha gonna do?!?  We got our athletic tape and other items we needed and went to their back room to retape our feet for the blisters, and while we were doing that, a young lady gave us her last couple of mini donuts.  Yum!  We appreciated her kindness!  When we went back outside, Bonsai ran into Soul Keeper and she tried to talk her into staying the night, but Bonsai told her that Tucker was anxious to get going again.  She offered to let Bonsai use her second shower she was allowed for her second day there, which was SO kind of her, but, it wouldn't be fair to Tucker for Bonsai to shower and him not get one, so...  We got some sandwiches, drinks, and Snicker bars and sat with New Jersey Jim (who camped behind the store last night) and ate our lunch and got back on the trail...full, but still stinky!  We had several big ups and downs today, some rather steep, and difficult.  Water was not as plentiful as we had hoped, but we found a spring at Hogpen gap, so Tucker told Bonsai to go ahead and find a stealth camp spot and set up the tent while he got the water.  So, Bonsai went ahead, found New Jersey Jim at a big stealth site, and he invited us to share the campsite.  As Bonsai was getting ready to set the tent up, she realized that Tucker had the tent poles and she had the tent, so, she had to wait for him to get there to set up.  It was getting cool out, so she put on her puffy jacket for the first time while waiting.  When Tucker arrived, we set up the tent, ate a snack, and crawled into the sleeping bags for the night.","Blood Mountain shelter

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563384,"It rained all night last night.  And, it was still raining in the morning.  Bonsai packed up all the stuff in the tent while Tucker went to get the bear bag and canister that were hanging in a tree.  These are are normal morning chores.  We ate breakfast in the tent, then quickly took the tent down and shoved it in Bonsai's pack and got hiking.  Today is the first day we had a steady rain, usually we had drizzle or a very light rain when it rained (except the night on Blood Mountain, that was brutal, but we were in the shelter).  We prefer wearing our ponchos to the rain jackets because we are not so hot in them, and we were wearing them this morning.  It continued to rain pretty hard all morning and into the early afternoon.  Thank goodness the terrain was not so bad, the ups and downs were small and not too steep.  But the trail was like walking in a river, as the rain was running down the mountains on the trails.  We were soaked from the knees down, and when the rain finally let up, we found a log to sit on to take off our shoes and socks, wring out our socks, retape our feet, and put the socks and shoes back on.  Then we kept walking.  Tucker didn't like for us to sit still too long.  ""You can't reach your destination if you don't keep moving"" is his most frequent sayings.  We were able to do lots of miles today in spite of the rain because of the good terrain.  Too bad it couldn't be like this every day...so much easier on the knees and feet!  We really don't mind walking in a light rain during the day, it just sucks when it rains at night and you have to put a wet tent away.  Today we didn't have lunch because of the rain, we didn't really want to stop and cook in the rain, so only ate snacks/granola bars.  Later in the day we found a stealth site on Blue Mountain, past the Blue Mountain Shelter.  It was very windy, so we unpacked the tent and hung in in trees to dry, which only took about ten minutes.  Then we set up the tent, Tucker went to hang our food, and Bonsai got the inside of the tent set up for bed.  It was a very windy night; the tent was leaning way over which was weird.  We woke up around 2 a.m. to pee, and it was SO cold outside!  The wind was still pretty strong, but the sky was ink black with huge, bright stars...SO beautiful!!!!","Stealth camp near Hogpen Gap

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564273,"This is Bonsai writing.  This has been a tough week for me and Tucker.  First of all, we were sad and frustrated to have to get off the trail due to my medical issues.  When we got home, we figured we would get the blackout issue taken care of (we think we got that licked), and that my knee and feet issues would improve so we could head back out to the trail this Sunday.  We had all the arrangements made.  We even went through our packs and got rid of some unneeded weight, and were very happy about that!  As the week went on, we started taking little walks around our hilly neighborhood to feel out the healing progress of the knees and feet.  My feet were doing ok, I had some soreness in my heels (just some minor bruising from the rocks on the trail, I suppose), and the blisters are all but healed up.  My big toe on my left foot took a beating on the trail...I think I didn't have my shoe tied tight enough for the downhills, and, well, my big toe and to one next to it still look pretty nasty but are feeling pretty good.  My biggest issue I am concerned about are my knees.  I never had a problem with them before we did this trip, but they have been very sore since.  When we took our walk this morning (I wanted to make my decision about going back to the trail or not today), I still had some sharp pains on the downhills, and that made me think long and hard.  I had enough health issues before we went on this adventure.  Some of them cause me daily pain.  I really don't want to add to that list of things that will cause me daily pain.  I would really love to get back out on the trail, see how things would go if we spent less time under our packs each day, see the beautiful scenery, and continue to blog and let you all see what we see and do, but, at this point, I feel it's more important to be more proactive about my physical self and health than to have the accomplishment of completing more of the trail at this time.  I think my desire to do a through hike is much stronger than my body, so, we are home to stay.  We hope to do some backpacking in the future, maybe some long weekends or such, but, a through hike is out of the question.  We gave it a valiant effort, and are glad we made the attempt and are proud of what we were able to do.  Thank you all for your words of encouragement, your prayers and well wishes when I was out of sorts.",,View Entry,"May 12, Fri",0

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565755,"I've been thinking about our gear...when we go back out there is some we will be leaving behind or changing because we didn't like what we had.  The most major change will be that Tucker didn't like his bear canister.  It's just way too heavy (about 2 lbs 11 oz) and is so hard to pack in the backpack because of it's shape.  We will stick with the Ursack, which is sturdy, pliable, and is easy to hang.  We also will go with lighter sleeping clothes.  We never did use the heavy long sleeve shirts or leggings.  A pair of light shorts and light tshirt will work.  Tucker was unhappy with his sleeping bag liner, which was just a cool sack (polyester, almost silky feeling) liner, that was too warm and almost felt slimy.  My liner was fine, as it was breathable, but added enough warmth for me.  Let's see, what else....oh, we most definitely will go stoveless on the next go.  We only cooked our lunch (which was mostly pasta sides or rice sides).  Since we've been home, we have been experimenting, and they can be soaked for a few hours without heating the water and get soft to eat.  So, we will try that.
We were planning to go back out in the next week, but then, as usual, when you are away from something long enough, you come up with something else.  We decided to redo the porch, as it has been rotting away (before we bought the house).  So, we will be tearing off the old porch wood this week, and next week or so, the new materials will be coming (non-wood, non-rotting) so we can rebuild it.  We will try to figure out when our new date is for getting back on the trail and let you know!",,View Entry,"May 23, Tue",0

(instead of I'm back).We have not lost our desire to hike!  We are currently planning to go back out on the trail on 1 September to start where we left off and hopefully get through the Smokies.  We figure that should take us about 20 days, or a little more.  Depending on how that goes will determine if we go out next year and complete the trail.  We'll see.  I'm just so glad we are going to try some more!Someone recently asked me about if I had any words of wisdom since we have started hiking the Appalachian trail.  This is what I told them:""Hmm, words of wisdom...DON'T soak your clothes in Permethrin!!!  Only spray it on the outside of your clothes (Bonsai had some rather serious medical complications, Tucker some topical skin issues).  Don't try to go faster or further than your body wants to go.  Start out slow and easy!  Be prepared to stink like you have never stunk before.  Perhaps at least wipe off at the end of the day before bed so you don't feel quite so gross climbing in your sleeping bag.  In that vein, use a sleeping bag liner that is soft and breathable to help keep your bag cleaner.  You can also use it alone on hot nights on top of your sleeping bag.  Definitely stop and check out the scenery, or a bug crawling on the trail, or flowers.  Check out what Mother nature has to offer as far as beautiful and strange things!  Bring a trowel!!!  Bury your waste and toilet paper!  A lot of people think you don't need a trowel, that you can use a stick or hiking pole to dig a cat hole...NOT!!!  There's lots of roots and rocks in the woods!  It's hard enough to dig a decent hole with a trowel!  Be considerate of others when coming into an area that all ready has tents up or hikers sleeping in a shelter.  It's downright rude to talk loud and make a lot of noise when others are sleeping!  Be polite and let the hiker coming up the hill go by.  It's harder for them to get their momentum back going up hill that it is for you going down hill.  Take EXCELLENT care of your feet!!  They are your most important piece of equipment and you can't do the hike without them!!  Address hot spots before they become full blown blisters.  It's easier to take care of at that point and less chance of infection or complication.  Make sure your shoes are tied a proper tightness for the downhills to prevent your foot from sliding forward and banging your big toes on the front of your shoe.  Only bad stuff can come from that!  Extreme bruising of the nail and toe, and eventually a lost toenail at the very least (Bonsai speaks from experience on this one, folks!)!So, there you have it!  Our most recent update and thoughts!  Hope to get back out there and give 'er (as Bonsai's step-dad would say), and keep you all up to date as we go!",,View Entry,"Jun 11, Sun",0

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590196,"After taking down the tent this morning, we sat on a log to eat breakfast, and a deer walked right through the campsite!  We got on the trail at 7 a.m.  We thought it was supposed to be down hill most of the way to Erwin, but we were wrong!  There were several steep ups, but at least they were relatively short.  Going was tough for me this morning.  I still had a bad headache and didn't feel very good.  I am pretty sure I have a concussion.
Shortly after leaving camp we came upon a 3 foot long black snake.  Tucker encouraged him off the trail with his hiking pole so we could pass. 
When we got to Uncle Johnny's Hostel, we both took a shower (mine was cold, but Tucker said he had hot water).  We went into the outfitter store and I noticed they had Moose tracks ice cream in pint size.  I got one, Tucker got two Gatorades, and we went on the porch to eat and drink. I still had my headache, but the ice cream sure was awesome!
Shortly afterwards, my parents showed up and took us home for me to recover from my concussion.  Mom said I shouldn't go back on the trail because it was trying to kill me!  I have no plans to go back in the near future.

Bonsai and Tucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591309,"So, after we got home from the trail, I tried to rest and not do much so I could feel better.  After a few days, I still wasn't feeling well, in fact I was feeling a bit worse.  My headache wasn't much better, I still had nausea occasionally, and I was SO tired all the time.  I was all ready sleeping at least 12 hours a night, plus just laying around the house during the day.  I called to talk to my doctor's nurse, and told her what was going on.  She talked to my doctor and called me right back and said I should go to the Emergency Room.  Well, I'm in the VA system, so, my husband drove me the two hours to Johnson City, TN to the VA hospital emergency room.  The doctor there confirmed that I had a concussion, but didn't have any bleeding on my brain, which is good!  He did a CT scan of my head and neck (I was having neck pain, too, so he wanted to make sure I didn't have any fractures there), he also checked to make sure my chin wasn't broken, and x-rayed my left knee to make sure there were no fractures there.  He said he saw no fractures anywhere (yay!) and that I had to go home and not do anything, just rest, no computer, tv, or reading.  Just rest my brain.  Preferably somewhere quiet and dark.  How boring is that?!  But that's just what I did.  It took a while, but the headache is gone.  My knee is still tender and feels some pressure under the knee cap, but the swelling is down to almost normal.  My chin bruise is gone but it is still tender and slightly swollen.  Looks like I'm gonna live!  And, being the sport I am, my sister is in town for the week and wants to go hiking, so, we are going to hike down to Abrams Falls in Cade's Cove tomorrow.  We'll see how I do...Bonsai!",,View Entry,"May 21, Mon",0
