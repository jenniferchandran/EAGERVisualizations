M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595911,"We are on our way to the trailhead! No more planning, packing and rechecking. The clouds are hanging very low over the mountains, with temperatures in the 90s and chance of thunderstorms. Perfect weather to welcome us to the AT ; )Scrapes says he is excited, but sad to leave Melon the dog. He is a man of few words this morning.I am excited and full of wonder. I have no expectations except for being tired, sore and happy. I was born to be outside.We will send a picture at the trailhead.","Success Pond Road

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595997,"While Scapes slept like a log, tent sleeping is not natural for me. My sleeping pad squeaked and slid around all night. The tent flapped constantly in thee breeze, and I miss my pillow. But it is still great being out here.
Last night we met a thru hiker that was on his one hundred and eleventh day! He gave us info about what to expect tomorrow and let us know we were not the only ones slowed way down by the heat.
Scrapes just got up to go the bathroom and his legs are tired for the first time in his life. Now I know we worked hard.","Carlo Col Campsite

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596127,"Leaving Maine is no joke. Had to take off our backpacks and grunt up steep slabs. One section was as cold as a refrigerator. Upon further inspection we found solid ice inside deep caves in the ground. A breeze was blowing the cold air out.
Witnessed a snake swallowing a toad. Took a video. We are trying to figure out how to send pictures to the journal.
Yesterday the trail was tough. Most of the time we were either going up or down steep terrain on slippery slabs of rock. We both fell a few time. Nothing serious but M has quite the cut on her knee.
Just when we thought we were making good progress to last night’s tent site my shoelace broke. Luckily a group passed us with a dog named Yadi. Yadi was carrying some stuff on his back, and it was all held on by a shoelace! We swapped my shorter one for his long one and we continued on.
I was dead tired when we finally got to our site. Luckily Scrapes still has gas in the tank, and helped set up camp, get water, and cook. We both fell asleep around 8:30.
Today I started a little concerned about my fatigue and the slow speed we are traveling. So far there was no need to worry. The terrain has been much nicer. Still not a walk in the park but so much better than yesterday.
We are sitting at a stream  right now as I update the journal. Scrapes is having fun damming up the flow then letting it loose. I am just enjoying the coolness coming off the stream and the butterfly that keeps circling around my head.
Later I need to do an update on what it is like to be traveling with a ten year old. Hopefully we will have a signal at the site tonight but I doubt it, as it is on the side of a mountain.","Gentian Tent Site

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596171,Came into camp last night dragging. I literally had to sit while Scrapes walked back and forth to get water.  He also set up the tent while I observed. He was awesome. By the time we had super he was worn out too.We found a beautiful ledge to have dinner on. It is between two mountains so you look up at the trees and the sky. I plan on laying our stinky sweaty stuff out on the ledge today to dry out since we are staying here one more night.We have met so many nice people. Scrapes has been asking everyone if they know any riddles. And then he asks them a riddle. I have seen many smiles on many faces because of him. Hear is a riddle for you: A snail is stuck in a well 30 feet down. Each day he crawls up 3 feet and slips back down 2 feet. How many days does it take for him to get out?I will update later today.,"

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596189,"When I was planning this trip at home I thought Screpes and I would be bored on our days off. It is already one o’clock and we haven’t even touched our deck of cards. There is so much to do in between resting that there is no time to be bored.Scrapes has been reading, inventing a game for his best friend Flash, and helping around the camp site.I have been lounging in the sun, reading, and trying unsuccessfully to wash our stinky dirty socks.We moved our tent deeper in the woods to be a little cooler, and I took a cold shower out of a ziplock bag. The thing I really miss are towels. There is no way to dry off anything.We have had a lot of bunnies, chipmunks and squirrels visiting us. I think the bunnies are attracted to Scrapes.We keep eating today and it is like our stomachs are bottomless. I didn’t feel as hungry while we were traveling.Thought I figured out the pictures but not yet. I will keep trying. Happy 4th of July!","

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596341,"It is amazing how fast things change on the trail. Emotions, physical strength, and plans got all jumbled in the past three days. It started with staggering into camp on day three, unable to help little Scrapes set up camp. My body felt totally done. I had chafe so bad I could barely walk and it was physically hard to even sit up. Scrapes was beat too but had a little energy to get him through to bed.That night we both fell asleep within minutes of laying down. I was violently woken by the biggest leg twitch I have ever had. I was frightened that I might have knocked Scrapes out.The next morning we had to go downhill to filter water. On the way back up to camp Scrapes and I decided we would take our first zero day (rest day).Feeling much better after the zero day, we decided to get up early on day five and push on to Gorham. Gorham was not a stop on our original itinerary but on day one my blood sugar sensor fell off my arm so I have been unable to test my blood sugar for the past four days. Not an ideal situation at any time and probably a little on the dangerous side with all the physical activity I was doing.So we scheduled the stop in Gorham at a hiker hostel. We will be able to get a ride into town to get a blood sugar meter.We got up early this morning and headed out to Gorham. The hike was physically easier than anything we have done, but the heat index ended up in the 100s. We drained six liters of water in five miles and barely made it to the smallest watering hole where we could filter water. Scrapes and I downed at least a liter of water at the hole. Then we filled our water bags and pushed on.Just when we started to make great time going downhill to Gorham Scrapes had a bad fall. Head first, on a steep downhill, getting his arm trapped under his body. And remember he had a twenty pound pack on.We sat on the trail for a while to assess his injuries. The worst was his shoulder. Initially he could not lift his arm ups. I told his we could leave his pack on the trail and come to get it later or he could try to carry it. He opted for carrying it. He kept his bad arm up like it was in a sling because I was afraid to actually have it in a sling and have him fall flat on his face. I lead him down very slowly for about an hour. Helped him with the more difficult sections and continuously reminded him to watch his step so he didn’t fall again.After about an hour he asked if we could re-assess the shoulder. He could lift it and move it so he took out his second hiking pole and we again made better time.We dragged ourselves into the hostel yard and collapsed on a picnic table. The hostel workers came out and gave us ice cream sandwiches. I can’t tell you how wonderful that was!We went through a unique check in procedure, with mandatory showers and wearing borrowed clothes so they can wash all of our offensively stinky clothing.Now we are comfortably lounging I our air conditioned room waiting for our six o’clock ride to Walmart.","Trident Col Tent Site

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596368,"It is funny how fast you can forget pain. Today on the trail I was miserable. The uphills hurt, the heat was pounding me down, we had to make a stop in Gorham, yada yada.Now I am laying here thinking what an incredible experience this is.We just took a van into town to buy supplies. The group of hikers were so nice. Riley was telling riddles and the driver forgot to make a scheduled stop to pick up some camping hikers because everyone in the van was listening to him. I am so proud of how outgoing he has been.In Walmart we raced around and bought so much food for tonight and tomorrow you would think we are throwing a party.When we came out of Walmart and got back in the van Scrapes and I were starving. I thought it might be rude but couldn’t help myself to the salad I just bought. Scrapes dug into the ding dongs and passed them around the van. As each person got into the van they started chowing on huge amounts of food. These are the hikers that started in Georgia. If I was hungry they must be ravenous. They must look forward to these restocks so much.","

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596377,"Scrapes had the first emotional breakdown on the trail today. He started to miss his friend, his dad, his pets, and his dead pets. He just kept walking and crying. It was a sad sight, but we talked after about what he misses and that these are the things in his life to hold tight to. 
He performed a little “ceremony “ on top of a mountain to the people he missed. He placed one rock on a carne (a rock formation to guide hikers in tricky sections) for each person and pet. He cried and asked if we could call everyone. We ended up calling dad, and made a plan to face time his best friend Flash.
A while later he was chatting away, happy as can be.
Then my emotions started. He asked about Mummu, my mom. She passed away seven years ago. Scrapes was only three years old at the time, and had spent a lot of time with her. He loves to hear stories about their time together and asks about how she would feel about him now. 
The emotions came when he asked me about the night she died. We had a very frank discussion about death and how that day went. Explaining this to my son brought back raw emotions that I haven’t felt for a long time. 
It was a conversation I will never forget, and don’t think he will either. 
This hiking is very rewarding and therapeutic. I am sure there will be more tears to come. I will keep you posted.
I will also add an upbeat entry to the journal tomorrow. The fun parts of the trail.
Good night for now. ","

He has a huge bump on the back of his head and a headache and says his big toe hurts.I googled concussions, gave him Tylenol, moved his mattress onto the floor, and helped him back to bed. I don’t know if I really need to wake him every once in a while, but I will just to be on the safe side.He has done so much this week. Really can’t believe he would get hurt sleeping. I will update the journal in the morning with a report. Signed a very tired and worried mom.","

He has a headache, he is dizzy and a little nauseous when he stands up.We don’t plan to hit the trail until Sunday morning so I will continue to assess him to see if we can push on.It is pouring out today so we are very glad to have a roof over our heads. There are about six other hikers here and about five staff that are so chill and kind. It is a great place to relax.Scrapes and I just finished playing one of these monopoly games that never ends. Now we are resting in our room. We like spending time in the common rooms to listen to the hiker stories and get advice. There is also a dog named Indiana Jones walking around receiving pats.We have started to receive messages through the guest book on this site. It is great to know people are following our journey. I did figure out how to add pictures so check them out! It only seems to work in town with a strong signal.The answer the the snail riddle is 27 days because on that day the snail makes it to the top and does not slip back down.Riddle two: There is a very old Japanese war ship. The captain’s very expensive watch is stolen. When the following people are asked what they were doing when the watch was stolen the replied as follows: the cook was cooking dinner, a deck hand was turning the flag over because it was upside down, and the navigator was busy navigating.

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596431,"Now that we have experienced the terrain I am interested in learning more about the area. I am reading the 30th Edition of the White Mountain Guide.According to it we started our hike in the Mahoosuc Range. We personally hiked Mt Carlos, Mt Success, Cascade Mountain, and Mt Hayes. There are other peaks in the Mahoosuc Range but they were not on our trail.Mt Success was named for the unincorporated township in which it is located, and Mt Carlos was named for a dog. The dog was owned by White Mountain pioneer Eugene Cook.If you remember in one of our first journal entries I mentioned how hard it was to exit Maine. This book says we were hiking the most remarkable feature of the range, called Mahoosuc Notch. The trail winds around and under huge fragments of rock that have fallen from the cliffs of Mahoosuc Mountain.That sounds about right. We have videos of us scaling those huge slabs of rock, and huge is an appropriate discription. Some of the fragments were ten feet wide and were scattered in an unthinkable pattern.The book goes on to explain that this is the most rugged trail of its kind in the White Mountains, and is regarded by many who have hiked the entire length of the AT as the trail’s most difficult mile.Oh yeah, and we did it! I am so proud of Scrapes. He did it all with a smile on his face.","

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596451,"Our zero day today was more restful than either of us would have liked. Because of the fall Scapes took last night we were mostly confined to our room resting. As of this evening Scrapes has not gotten any better. He has a headache, unsteady gait, and mild nausea when he stands up. At this point I don’t think it looks good for him getting back on the trail on Sunday. I will remain hopeful.If we can not proceed on schedule i am hopeful Scrapes will be up for remaining in New Hampshire until he is recovered. Either that or we return to Connecticut to wait for recovery. Personally I love New Hampshire and hope he opts for the first scenario. I will not tell him this because I want this to be his decision. ","

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596456,"There are many ways to hike a thru hike. You could go solo, go with a partner or friend, and you can travel loosely with friends you meet on the trail, hiking your own hike but meeting up occasionally along the way. As you know my hike is with a partner. He is not your average thru hiking partner, he is my ten year old son. It is a joy to observe him traveling through this journey. As a kid he is always living in the moment, he has little need in his life to pay attention to time, and he is contagiously optimistic. And funny!Every once in a while he comes out with a priceless comment. Here are three of my favorites so far.One: I wondered outloud why there are not more white blazes on the tricky parts of the trail. Blazes are paint marks to show hikers the way. Some areas are dense with them, other areas you are left wondering where to go. Most of these confusing areas are high up and far away from the more highly traveled lower trails. Upon hearing my question he simply replied that the person painting the blazes got tired of carrying the paint bucket. Hmmm.Two: We were hiking through a most annoying swarm of all types of biting insects and he blurts out. If a car came up the trail and jumped over my head right now it’s windshield would be covered in dead bugs. Hmmm.Three: when I called for a last minute reservation at the hostel I had my phone on speaker. The voicemail instructions asked me to leave name, phone number, and reason for call. When I hung up Scrapes informed me that I didn’t tell him the reason for the call. I did leave a message about needing a reservation, but Scrapes insisted that I should have told him the reason we needed to come to town was because I lost my tampons. What?Just want to say sorry to any hikers disappointed by my careless dropping of tampons along the trail. For the record the tampons are securely packed with our first aid supplies in a watertight bag. I checked.Apologies if these Scrapes statements are not funny to the reader. It might have been a you had to be there moment, an overtired moment, or I love my kid more than you and just think he is the funniest kid. Anyway, he keeps me smiling.Have a great night. Hug your kids if you have any.","

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596481,"We have decided to take a week off. Scrapes is still showing strong signs of concussion. It would be ill advised to enter the Presidentials in his state. Not only will we be above tree line for miles, we will be hiking over a number of 5000 foot summits, including Mt Washington. The plan is to consult a doctor, stay in New Hampshire, and rest. I was happy Scrapes wanted to stay in NH because it will be easier for me to help him rest his head. I will need to look over distances and potential re-supply locations to decide a new plan of attack. If you are reading this plan, check back on Saturday. ","

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596648,"We received a question about why Scrapes and I have taken this journey, what is our goal is, and what our time line is?
The idea for thru hiking NH came from Scrapes last year while we were backpacking in the White Mountains. At the same time we were reading books about hiking the New Hampshire 4000 footers and books about the Appalachian Trail. He was especially intrigued by the book Up, about a mother and her daughter hiking the 4000 footers. 
He asked if we could hike the Appalachian Trail in 2018. When I explained that it would take too long he sad. I offered a week or a short section, but he said it was either the whole thing or nothing. Eventually he did not talk about thru hiking, and the subject lay dormant until ski season ended.
As soon as we hung up our skis for the season Scrapes came up with the idea of trying to thru hike the NH AT. I told him it was a realistic goal if he was willing to spend the summer in the attempt.
So here we are. Our goal is to go as far as we can while we are still enjoying ourselves. We have until school starts at the end of August to hike border to border.
As for the struggles we have been through so far, they are all part of the journey. Scrapes and I are a team, and we work through the easy and the hard together. We are both learning things about ourselves, are seeing the most wonderful sights, and are interacting with wonderful people from the thru hiking community. 
We will continue to put one foot in front of the other until it is no longer fun. Hope that answers the question of our intentions.
We will be getting back on the trail this week!","

We will stay in the hut over night and be served supper and breakfast. The next two days we will hike back to the hostel where we left off. This will put us in good shape to hike the Presidentials from Sunday, July 15 - Thursday, July 19. Keep your fingers crossed that the weather cooperates.Can’t wait to start!

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597021,"Yesterday we hiked the Wildcats. It was a six mile hike with about five miles of rugged uphill climbing. The last mile down to the hut was a steep decent.As we hiked up there were occasional legde lookouts. Each one was more spectacular than the one before it. The most dramatic views come at the top. It almost felt like you could reach out and touch the Presidentials. All of Mt Washington’s features were so dramatic. To the left we could see Tuckerman’s Ravine and on the right Huntington’s Ravine. We could see the auto road and the towers at the top. Simply stunning.It was fun to reach the summit Wildcat because we had skied there just three months ago. The gondola was bringing people to the top. A few of them asked questions about our hike.We had lunch on a rickety old picnic table. I think I have found my lunch of choice. Peanut butter crackers and sweet Italian sausage. Scrapes does not really like this so I will still have to make him sandwiches.We hiked with a lot of people headed to the same hut. It is neat to see them on and off the trail. We ate dinner with them, played cards, and talked hiking. One lady had a little too much wine. Scrapes was intrigued by her.The croo at the hut woke us this morning at 6:30 with a guitar. I thought I was dreaming. It was the best wake up I can ever imagine. We had a nice big breakfast prepared by the Croo, then packed up and left.Right now we are almost to the top of Carter’s Dome. It is the first time we have had any cell service in two days. We will be hiking three 4000 footers today.Hopefully we will be able to write tonight at the camp site.Happy trails!","

Nestled in between the Carters was Mt Height. It was my favorite summit so far. When we got to the top there was a 360 degeee view, and part of the views were of mountains we hadn’t seen yet.Last night we didn’t journal because we got into camp late. By the time we filtered water, had supper, and set up the tent it was 9:30. It was a cold night. I wore long undies, a fleece, and zipped up tight in my sleeping bag. Nice and cozy. Before last night it was just shorts, T-shirt, and no bag.With an eight mile hike ahead of us today we got up early and hit the trail. Mt Moriah was 1.3 miles up from our tent. It seems like each morning we hit the trail on a steep ascent. We are certainly getting used to it. As a matter of fact I have noticed some nice changes in my fitness level. Less huffing and puffing, less rest breaks, and a little faster. With this increased fitness the past few days have been very enjoyable. I feel ready to go on. Scrapes was pretty tired hiking the last two and a half miles today. Tomorrow we are planning a zero day, then Monday we will attempt the Presidentials.

Almost all of the people we pass take the time to stop and chat. We have taken snack breaks with groups, have just sat and looked at a view with a girl named Highlight, and helped direct each other.Yesterday we passed Ranger the dog and his owner. We stopped to chat and found out he was headed the same direction as us, but he was going the opposite way. It took a little convincing, but he got turned around before he made a big mistake.It is great to hear people tell their stories.

We will be dropped off in the middle of nowhere on route 302, and hike over the Presidentials to our van at Pinkham Notch. If you remember we left the van there this past week.A zero day today at home did wonders to regenerate us. My feet were tender this morning and my knees were sore any time I stepped down. A good friend who hiked the entire AT gave me the advice to wear puffy socks around today with no shoes. Between that and swimming in nice cool mountain water my feet are almost back to normal. After another good night of sleep in a comfy bed tonight they should be ready to get back into hiking shoes.We finally ditched a few things from our bags. We had a bag of fun that seemed to weigh a ton. We got rid of Riley’s book since we are too tired to read at night. Plus you have to hold your arms up straight over your head to read in the tent. No couches or chairs, and sitting cross legged is the last position we want to be in. We also left the hacky sack named George, the body glide that did not help at all with chafe, bio-degradable soap because we are just too dirty for it to do any good, and an extra pair of long underwear that I didn’t know was in the pack. Unfortunately the packs still feel very heavy, but there is  a little more room.Looks like the weather is giving us a good window to make it over Mt Washington on Wednesday.

The entire day we will be high on a ridge above tree line. We can not get stuck in a thunderstorm there.Today was the first day that we are bumping into people we have seen before. We saw Kayak, Vegi, and Karma on the trail. And just now Highlight walked past our campsite. She was the girl we sat with on one of the Carters to rest. This is really starting to make it feel like we are part of the thru group. Today at lunch we dined with a little mouse. I will post a picture of him when we have enough service to send photos. Highlight just walked by again and asked us if we are going to the hut to see if we can get any leftovers from their dinner. Yes, yes, and yes! Did not know it was an option. Scrapes and I had chicken with rice for dinner and we are both still hungry.In October there was a microburst that blew down many of the trees in the campsite. The caretaker explained that a microburst is wind that blows straight down. It looks like three quarter of the trees are down.

The entire hike was above tree line, and most of the time we could see far ahead to where we were going. Some of the climbs and descents were tricky, but luckily the wet rocks did not seem slippery.We were forced to summit Mt Monroe because part of the AT was closed. The wind going to the top was incredible. The rain was hitting us like flying pebbles. I thought my backpack cover or my hat was going to fly off, but they stayed secure.We never got leftover food last night, but we got free pancakes at this hut. Scrapes got a little ahead of himself and grabbed a brownie too, which was not free. We paid for it with our free thru hiker pastry pass.Now we are playing cards, then a NAP!Stay dry!","Nauman Tent Site

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597527,"Today we are going to do our first stay put. Right now it is cloudy with occasional blue skies peeking through. The temperature will climb into the low 40s with a steady 51 mile per hour wind. This puts the windchill at freezing all day along the ridge. The croo has suggested that we do not attempt today’s hike so we are going to stay here. We have our names on a waiting list to stay one more night in the hut. If there is no availability we will stay in the dungeon with the other thru hikers.Scrapes has been developing a business and I am benefiting from it. He is teaching himself massage. Each massage he comes up with he attaches a money value to it and I can order different packages. So far I have gotten all the massages as he makes them up. Once I have gotten one then I have to pay.  Now I get a foot massage daily and occasional leg massages. He also does backs, but my back feels fine.","

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597562,"We initially thought we would stay put today, but when the sun came out we decided to hit the trail. One concern of mine was that all of our hiking clothes were still wet. I could not imagine how cold we would have been with the temps in the 40s and the 50 mile per hour wind. Instead of wearing the wet stuff we opted for our long underwear, sleeping shorts, and fleeces. We also purchased hats and gloves. It was a winning combo.The hike was 1.5 miles. It was super easy with gorgeous views of the valley. The trail was all rocks with carins set every fifteen feet to keep hikers on the trail.At the top it was like a shopping mall. There were cars, people huffing and puffing up the steps from the parking lot, and a line to take a picture at the summit. Inside there was a quiet spot downstairs for hikers. Upstairs had a post office, snack bar, gift shop, and museum. Scrapes kept saying everyone looked so civilized. Not sure what that made us look like?Since we started late due to the weather, we did not think we could make the hike from Washington to the next tent site. We confirmed this suspicion when we talked to a lady leading a group through the Whites.We ended up taking a hiker shuttle to the Pinkham Center where our van was parked. Then a short drive to North Conway to a cheep, but delightful hotel. In the morning we will drive back up to the shuttle to return to the top of Mt Washington. Then we are going to try a slack pack. We are planning on dumping a lot of our gear to lower our pack weight. In theory we will be able to travel faster and further. If it works out we will make it the 11 miles back down to our van in one day. If not we will sleep under a tent fly without a tent. Another adventure! I personally love all these changes of plans. There is always more than one way to get things done.We probably will not have any cell service tomorrow so we will have to wait until tomorrow night to get an update out. Unless we get styck in the woods, then we will have to wait until Friday.Happy trails!","Lakes of the Clouds

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597770,"Got up early this morning and drove back to the Pinkham parking lot. Just as we were walking through the parking lot the AMC hiker shuttle drove up. We asked the driver if we could hitch a ride two miles up the street to the Mt Washington auto road. The driver said sure.We got dropped off at the auto road shuttle office before they opened. Scrapes and I are so patient now. We just sat around talking and looking at the view.At nine we hopped on the auto road hiker shuttle and rode back to the top of Mt Washington. Our driver’s name was Patty and we found out she teaches skiing at Breton Woods. When we told her Scrapes is on the ski program there she asked our name. She recognized Scrapes’ name and said she thought I looked familiar. Small world.Leaving Mt Washington was amazing. We walked down by the cog railroad tracks, crossed the tracks, and continued down with the Great Gulf Wilderness on our right. At times we were walking on a narrow path with no room for mistake. One trip and we would have made it to the bottom at terminal velocity. I tried not to say be careful too much to Scrapes.There are about sixty days per year that Mt Washington is cloud free, and today turned out to be one of them.The hike started like any other. We were rested and in good spirits. Then we started to realize what we were walking on. Rocks of all sizes, shapes, and angles. Each step pushed on our feet and required total concentration to pick safe passage.After about an hour Scrapes uncharacteristicly started to wilt. He said his feet were hot and starting to hurt. There was no joyful bantering today.We just had to suck it up and push on. I was Scrape’s cheerleader, mom, and coach all day. I cheered him on, hugged him when he needed it, and made inspirational commentary to keep him focused.About two thirds of the way we met an older woman named Nancy. She had a grand daughter the same age as Scrapes. She stuck with us and played a word game with us to pass the time.Early in the day I realized we were not going to make it to Pinkham. We started to focus on getting to the Madison Hut to try to get a bed for the night.We stumbled into the hut at 5:30 pm. They did not have any beds left, but decided to let us use the two beds set aside for emergency rescue workers.Scrapes struggled to sit up during dinner, then fell sound asleep at 6:30. We had a great night sleep.","Mt Washington

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597774,"We left the hut and immediately climbed up to the top of Mt Madison. It was a steep rocky climb, but after the painful rocks the day before the steep climb was actually nice.From the summit we could see the long ridge we would be hiking down. We could see the auto road far far off to our right. We were looking forward to reaching the auto road, which would put us just two miles from our destination.With about five miles left we met a thru hiker that told us about a swimming hole a mile ahead. When we got to it I jumped right in. The water was freezing, crystal clear, and so refreshing. The pain in my knees and feet melted away.We stayed at the swimming hole for about thirty minutes then decided to press on. We hiked into Pinkham around six o’clock, hopped in our van that we had parked there a week ago, and drove to a hotel in Franconia.My feet and legs are so sore even though we are not walking anymore. After I update this journal I am going to take an ice bath.Good night.","Madison Hut

M and Scrapes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597821,"Scrapes and I have made the decision to end our journey across New Hampshire today at mile sixty four. All along I understood Scrapes wanted to get back to Connecticut to enjoy those seemingly endless days of summer with his friends. And all along we were out to discover new adventures, meet new people, and see new sights. I feel like, short of walking our originally planned distance, we hit all of our intended goals.This was a journey that will not be forgotten. It has been just a few hours finished and Hot Sauce (Scapes’s dad) says he notices a change in Scrapes. He Is taking charge. Today he planned a guys day to Attitash with his dad. Not only did he plan it, he packed everything they would need for the day. As I watched him thoughtfully place towels and bathing suits into his backpack I saw pride in his new ability to lead.And as I lounge by the hotel pool I am happy to report that the old Scrapes is strongly mix in with the new. He is still my active and adventurous ten year old boy, but now there is a hint of the man he will become. And just like our journey on the trail, we will go step by step, cherishing each minute and looking forward to all life will bring us. I will spend a few days processing our journey, and will do a few more posts. I will try to encourage Scrapes to put some of his thoughts down in the journal. So far he has been hesitant, but you never know.Happy trails!","
