Rogue Cartographer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587239,"Today we finished the drive to Georgia. Tomorrow morning the adventure starts! Bags are pack, gear has been checked and rechecked. All of the gear seems to be good to go. Tomorrow morning we'll get up and drive the hour or so up to the Springer Mountain parking lot then hike the mile south to the official start of the AT. It has been two years yesterday since I started for the first attempt. Last time I made it to Mountain Harbour Hostel just south of VA. Last time I made the decision to hike into Erwin TN on the road and walked out with Shin Splints. This time I know better! See you on the Trail!",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Thu",0
Rogue Cartographer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587531,"Today makes day two of the trail. We've made it about 20 miles to Woody Gap, not quite as far as I'd have liked to but we've passed the minimum day two point (Gooch Gap). They're calling for rain tomorrow (and the next few after) so it could either be a short day to Jarrard Gap (5.7ish) or we could push to Neel Gap (11.7ish miles, I'm hoping for this one) but we have a couple of good climbs ahead of us. Today we made it two milestones: we flipped to a new page in the guide and we made it passed 20 miles! Dad twisted his ankle yesterday he says it's not tender but he has a pretty good bruise.","Sassafras Mtn

Rogue Cartographer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590923,Today was a nice relaxing day in Erwin  TN. This is the town that two years ago gave me the shin splints. I'm doing better this time around. 51 miles until I pass the point at which Marimoball picked me up last time. See you on the trail!,"Fontana Dam

Rogue Cartographer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591681,Well it's been a couple of weeks. I'm officially in new territory! Two days ago I made it to Mountain Harbour Hostel in Roan Mountain TN the place Marimoball picked me up two years ago. I've gone 32 miles since then yesterday was a super easy 18 mile day and today was a fairly easy day as well. I have a slight sprain or something goon on with my right ankle. It only hurts when going downhill for a long while and when it does its only a 2-3 out of 10 on the hospital scale. I've been taping it during the day and putting it up when at camp so it seems to be on the mend. I'll be in Damascus VA on Sunday!,"Erwin TN

Rogue Cartographer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593248,"It's been an eventful couple of weeks. First made it to Damascus, then to 500 miles, then to Marion, then to 600 miles! Now I'm nearly to Pearisburg where I will meet Marimoball for the weekend! A couple of days ago I stubbed my toe quite badly on a nice hidden rock while wearing my flip flops at camp and have a nice cut on the tip of my toe. It's doing fine just hurt a bunch and since it's a toe it bled a lot.Looking forward to making it to Harper's Ferry!","Boots Off Hostel, Hampton TN
