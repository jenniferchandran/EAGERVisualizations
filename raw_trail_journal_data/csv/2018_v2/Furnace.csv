Two years out:
 
     My goal is to hike
the Appalachian Trail starting in the spring of 2018.  I've been thinking about taking this
challenge for a couple of years.  I've read
some accounts of others who have done it and I'm pretty sure I want to try to hike
the entire trail in one chunk.  There are
still tons of questions in my mind.  Can
I do it?  Am I sure I want to do it?  Can I afford to do it?  How is it done?  And, lastly, why do I want to do it?  
 
     My plan is to try
to answer the first couple of questions by doing some local hiking starting
this year.  I've always enjoyed camping
and hiking but haven't really done a ton and definitely not much long distance
hiking.  I need to find out if my 54 year
old body can handle the physical side of it and if it is something to which I
am mentally suited.  I'm pretty sure the
answer to both questions is yes, but a series of longer and longer hikes will
cement the answer.  The first hike is
coming up in May.  I have a week of
vacation coming and my wife has agreed to go with me on a one night overnight
hike.  This one will be short because she
doesn't want to go too far so I'm thinking of a slow in and out hike of five miles
each day.
 
   The question of
finances is a little more complex than it appears on the surface.  A thru-hike of the trail takes between five
and seven months.  I will be fifty-six at
the time so if I take that amount of time away from my job it will probably
mean there is no coming back.  I'm a
pharmacist and the job market for my profession has changed considerably in the
last ten years.  There was a time when
there was a shortage of pharmacists which meant that you could jump from one
job to another or take an extended break and come back to work.  This situation had existed for such a long
time that colleges and universities realized there was a market for more
pharmacy programs.  Many of them started
programs at the same time and started churning out more and more pharmacists
into the work force to the point that there are now multiple applicants for
most pharmacy openings.  The chances of a
man in his late fifties landing one of those openings has become rather slim.
 
     I still have
plenty of time to figure out the “how to” but from what I've read it is both
harder and easier than I originally thought. 
I had the idea that you would be spending weeks at a time in complete
isolation without access to civilization, surviving by your backwoods
skills.  In reality most of the trail is
close enough to towns and roadways that it is relatively easy to resupply when
needed.  There are also a fair number of services
such as shuttles, hostels, outfitters, and cheap hotels in towns close enough
to the trail to allow hikers the chance to get what they need and maybe even
spend the occasional night in a real bed.  
     It will be harder than I originally thought due to the physical and mental toll put on a person by
hiking over mountainous terrain for five to seven months.  Depending on where you get your statistics,
only 1in 5 or 1 in 10 people actually succeed in hiking the entire trail in one
hiking season.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Wed",0

Why
     Why?  Well, that is a big question and probably a
big answer.  I'll start off with some
quick one-liners from lyrics and move on to a more detailed answer.
                        Neil
Young said: “It's better to burn out than fade away”.
                        Robert
Earl Keen said: “It all comes down to living fast or dying slow”
                                      again REK:                        “I am guilty of a dreadful selfish crime,
                                                                        I
have robbed myself of all my precious time”.
                        And
lastly Bruce Springsteen said:  “Some
guys they just give up living and start dying
                                                                                    little
by little, piece by piece”
 
Well I'm not quite ready to start dying little by little,
piece by piece but I feel like I am awfully close to the first step down that
road.  Some people may call it a mid-life
crisis but they are wrong on a couple of fronts.  I'm not mid-life unless I expect to live to
110 and it isn't a crisis.   I would call
it an awakening, an epiphany, a newfound clarity or a reassessment of
priorities.  I'm tired of getting up,
going to work, making money, coming home, and going to bed.  Call it a rat race if you want but I've had
enough.  I want an adventure.  I want to test myself.  Basically I want the opposite of what I'm doing
now.  
 
Don't get me wrong, I know I'm pretty lucky as far as
lifestyle goes.  My wife and I both earn
a good living and we've always lived within our means so what little debt we
have is manageable even without my income. 
We eat out when we want, we travel when I have vacation time, and we
have decent cars, a decent house, a couple of boats, and some wonderful friends.
 The problem is that I feel like I am biding
my time until I'm old enough to not feel bad about retiring.  The operative word in the last sentence is
“old”.  There is an old saying that youth
is wasted on the young.  I believe that
retirement is wasted on the old.  I’ve
reached the point that I'm willing to risk running out of money at the end of
my life versus waiting to retire when I'm too old to enjoy the things
I want to do.
 
Plus, I like hiking.  I
get a sense of peace in the forest and I need some peace.
 
Another reason I want to try something like this is I have to
get away from my current job.  I'm a
pharmacist in a retail pharmacy setting and I am just sick and tired of dealing
with the public.  The satisfaction from
helping a little old lady sort out her medicine or pick the correct bandage
after her husband's surgery is way overshadowed by the addicts, the insane, the
thieves, the liars, the complainers.....well, you get the idea.  I need a break.
 
 
    There are several
reasons I'm waiting two years instead of starting this year or next.  There are probably even more reasons why I
want to start as soon as possible.  2018
is the best compromise between obligations, age, financial situation and
physical fitness.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Wed",0
Furnace,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582741,"5/7/16 –More answers to “Why”
 
I want to shake off the mantle of adulthood and try to recapture
the carefree adventurous attitude of youth. 
Find the joy in not thinking everything through.  The glee in making uninformed decisions and
the thrill of the unexpected.  The
unexpected anything....good or bad, high or low, beauty or ugliness.  I know this is about hiking but sailing is
another dream/passion of mine and I've found the same unrest and desire to
change in many of the first-hand accounts of people who've quit everything and
gone sailing.

Furnace,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589320,"There are around 250 shelters along the trail.  They are placed from 5 to more than 15 miles apart.  The average distance between them in around 8 miles.  Shelters are 3 sided structures that have a roof and room for as few as 4 people to as many as 14.  They vary in condition but most have a picnic table, a fire pit tent sites nearby, and an outdoor privy or outhouse. (More about the good and bad of privies later.  Bet you can't wait)When planning a day's hike the location of the shelter can play a big role.  If it is windy, rainy or both it is much easier to sleep in the shelter rather than pack up a wet tent the next day.  The drawback to a shelter is the proximity of your fellow hikers.  Plenty of snoring can make for a long night.  Shelters also have mice and sometimes the snakes that like to eat them.  Some areas of the trail require that you camp is designated campsites which usually means a shelter or near one.  I've probably spent about 60 percent of my trail nights so far in a shelter.  A few nights in hostels near the trail and a couple of nights in hotels.  Hostels are cheap, warm, usually have laundry for a price and a real bed  and bath but you may be in a room with 6 others and share the bath with more.Going forward I will probably spend more nights in my tent even if I am near a shelter.  The weather is getting better and the snoring isn't.","Ensign Cowall shelter

Furnace,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589797,"I know you have been waiting for this post so here is a little discussion on privies.  As the famous children's book taught us ""Everybody Poops"".  (Look it up, it is a real book).  When hiking you basically have 3 choices when it comes to doing your business.The first choice is to dig a hole in the ground where a rock, log, or some bushes give you privacy.  When you are done you cover it up like a cat in a litter box.  That's why these are known as cat holes.  Not the most appealing option but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.The good news is that the shelters I wrote about last time come with a privy.  They are basically composting toilets set off from the shelter that give some privacy.  Most have sawdust to cover up when you are finished.  You can see why hand sanitizer is so important!The last option now seems like the height of luxury.  If you stay in a hostel, a hotel, or stop at a roadside diner you get to use a ""flushy"".  What a treat.","Boiling Springs, PA

I was wearing a pair of Crocs.  These are ""camp shoes"".  The confusion made me think I should explain how clothing works on the trail.  Prepare yourself for a nap or maybe to be grossed out.I have one set of clothes for hiking.  A pair of quick dry pants that zip off into shorts, a thin Merino wool t shirt, special ""no stink"" underwear, wool hiking socks and a pair of hiking shoes.  All of these things are supposed to dry quickly and not hold odors.  I wear them every day for up to 5 or 6 days at a time and they really don't get too smelly except for the shoes and socks.  Especially if the shoes get wet.  As soon as I reach my camping area at the end of the day I take as much of this off as I can and air it all out.I change into my camp clothes and sleep in them.  They are basically the same outfit but I don't sweat in them or get them wet.  Most hikers have camp shoes as well.  Crocs seem to be popular but some people use flip-flops.  My Crocs aren't the standard variety.  They have a cloth webbing upper and a fairly grippy bottom.  They are light and they dry fast.I have additional layers including a puffy down jacket which was used as recently as June 4th.  I also have a light rain jacket and a rain skirt.  It is like a very thin poncho for my lower half.  It goes on easily and keeps my shorts dry and allows a lot more ventilation than rain pants.One last note.  I've been told that June 21st is hike naked day.  Not something I plan on participating in!!","

Furnace,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596839,"These are some thoughts from my hike.  Nothing new here but sometimes I have to relearn the same things again and again.From the desk of Captain Obvious:1.  Don't climb the mountain before you get to it.  For weeks and weeks I heard about the White Mountains of New Hampshire and I worried about them.  Everyone said they were going to be extremely hard.  I gave the thought of them more of my attention than they deserved.  In the end they were very hard but they were also extremely wonderful.  I experienced a lifetime of views in a week's time.  I learned the obvious lesson of not worrying about a hard problem too much.  Thinking and planning are important but don't drain your energy and miss out on the present because of worry about the future.2.  Focus on the small things.  I have fallen way too many times and it seems to be during comparatively easy sections.  I always focus intently on hard sections but sometimes let my guard down when the going is easier.  There must be a lesson somewhere....3.  Swim when you can.  Even though the water here is freezing cold I've learned to try to swim when the opportunity presents itself and I haven't been sorry.  Even if it is just a quick wade and rinse I've learned to enjoy the good things in life when the show up.  You never know when you're going to get the chance to do the fun things again.  Don't let them pass.4.  You are stronger than you think.  When I started my hike I wasn't sure if I would make it 100 miles.  Now I've passed 1000!  I think everyone is a little stronger than they think.  You never know until you are tested.4.  A good support system is a huge help.(obvious again). Support can come from many sources.  I've been very very lucky to have my wife, Ruth Anne, behind me every step of the way.  She's sent packages, visited twice, cheered me on and up and let me know I was loved every day.  I've also been lucky enough to get help from fellow hikers and even strangers along the way.  Just today someone helped me fix my pack so it wouldn't rub a raw spot on my hips like it had been doing.  Lesson: take help when you can.5.  (Last one.  I promise). Find joy every day.  I've really tried to do this even when it is a terrible day and joy seems a long way away.  Sometimes it will find you when you least expect it.  Recently I was really down.  It was raining about as hard as possible and I was completely soaked from head to squishy to.  I crossed a road and saw an awning set up in the woods.  I just wanted to get out of the rain for a few minutes so I ducked inside. To my happy surprise I met The Omelette Man.  Carl shows up on the trail most days and provides juice, coffee, water, bananas, muffins, and donuts for hikers.  Then he fires up his camp stove and cooks omelettes for any hiker that comes by.  What a joy on a miserable day!","

Furnace,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598860,"The Hundred Mile Wilderness taught me some lessons on planning and expectations.  When you look at the topographic map and guide for the stretch of the trail known as the 100 mile wilderness it doesn't look daunting.  A few mountains at the beginning then mostly moderate elevation changes the rest of the way.  The guide doesn't describe the actual condition of the trail under your feet or the weather.  To avoid carrying too much weight in food, I planned a six day trip and packed slightly more than six days worth of provisions.  I soon found out that the trail is extremely Rocky and covered in tree roots so my progress was slower than expected.  The weather also conspired to make it a grueling, wet, bug infested slog of hiking.  By the end I was at the physical and mental low point of my hike.Eventually I reached the end of the 100 miles with 2 packs of oatmeal, some Clif bars, and a package of ramen noodles.  I was extremely glad to see the camp store and restaurant near the entrance to Baxter State Park.  I devoured breakfast at the restaurant and bought enough snacks for one additional day because the next day was my planned summit of Mt Katahdin and the end of the northbound portion of the hike.Sunday came and the sun arrived just in time.  It was a cool, clear  6 am as I dropped my big pack at the ranger station and exchanged it for a small loaner pack.  I brought just the essentials for a day hike and headed up the mountain at 6:30.  All of the pains, blisters, chafing and negative thoughts seemed to vanish as I hiked the first few moderate miles at an extremely fast pace.  Even the challenging rock climbing and high elevation hiking that came next didn't slow me down as much as it normally would.  I guess I was running on adrenaline but I felt like I was barely touching the ground at some points.  I stopped to pick wild blueberries from the side of the trail.  They have never tasted so sweet.  I drank from the Thoreau spring that runs beside the trail within site of the peak.  It is named for Henry David Thoreau who climbed Katahdin and whose writings have inspired my adventure.I reached the summit at 10 am.  There was only one other hiker when I arrived.  The Sunday crowd of day hikers was still behind me.  The view, the weather, and the experience were glorious.  I took pictures, enjoyed the view and thought about my journey.  Unlike the hikers that started in Georgia, this wasn't the ultimate end of my journey but it was still an emotional moment and the end of a long hard wonderful trek.I'll take a little time off now before I return to my starting spot in Virginia and start hiking southbound.  I still have 863 miles to go before I am finished.  Ruth Anne and Will drove all the way from Spartanburg to pick me up.  We're going to see a little more of Maine then head down the East coast.","

Furnace,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602793,"Missed opportunities.
Recently I missed out on two visits that we're very important to me.
The first was a potential visit from a good friend, Pete.  Pete and I go way back. He was one of my college roommates and currently lives in Colorado.  The only time I usually get to see him is when our group of college friends get together every couple of years when Pete and his wife, Colleen come East to see his family.  This time he was making a solo trip to NC and offered to meet up with me on the trail. Unfortunately bears got in the way.
During the time we were hoping to get together I was moving through a part of Virginia that had closed seventeen miles of trail to any type of camping.  There were multiple encounters in that area with bears that wanted hiker's food and wouldn't take “No” for an answer. Pete was a four hour drive from there and I couldn't give him a meeting time because my hiking partner and I didn't know how we were going to traverse the closed area.  I can hike 17 miles but I wouldn't be able to camp near the start or the end of the bear zone. That left us with 3 options. The first was to take a side trail out of the zone at about the halfway point. The second option was to ignore the warnings and stay in a closed shelter. The third was to hike about 23 miles and get well past the zone.  The first 2 options would have put me at a meeting point with Pete on a Thursday and the last one would get me there on Wednesday. We had no way of knowing which option to choose until we saw the trail conditions after we started on Tuesday.
That is a lot of explanation to say as much as I would have liked to see Pete, I didn't think it was fair to ask him to drive 4 hours when I wasn't sure which day I would make it to a meeting place.
The second missed opportunity was ruined due to hurricane Florence.  
My son Alex was planning on coming for a weekend and hiking with me.  One of my favorite memories of Alex during his early childhood was a hike we took together when he was about 6.  We hiked in Caeser's Head State Park. I have a picture of him with his backpack and baseball cap. He and/ or his brother and I have hiked together many times since then but it would have been very special to have him with me during this big adventure that I'm attempting.
Alex’s schedule is pretty full right now with a full time job and graduate school in the evenings.  The only weekend we could make it work was September 15th and 16th. The weather forecast wasn't looking great to begin with and then Hurricane Florence decided to head for the Carolinas.  The uncertainty of the path of the storm and the potential for problems in Alex's area as well as here on the trail made us decide to cancel the weekend.
I'll be able to see Pete another time and I am sure Alex and I will hike together again but I am disappointed that they couldn't share some of my time on the trail.","

Thanks to Hurricane Florence I got to spend a couple of days at home this week.  The forecasters seemed to think that it would come ashore in Wilmington then head through South Carolina and directly at my location on the trail.  It seemed like a good idea to avoid 2 to 3 days of torrential rain and the potential flooding that would accompany a storm of this size.
The good news was that I wouldn't have to ride out the storm in a hostel or small town hotel because I was close enough to home for someone to come and get me.  The first someone was my son, Will. Milo and I hiked through the rain on Sunday, September 16th and made it to Hot Springs, NC. Will met us for brunch and drove us to Sierra Nevada brewery where we met Ruth Anne.  After more food and a little beer we headed home.
While in Spartanburg I was able to exchange my sleeping pad at REI.  I bought it in early August and it already developed a slow leak. They have a good return policy so I have a new pad for the rest of the hike.  Milo and I refilled our food bags and did our best to eat everything in sight for two days.
Even though the forecast called for rain  Monday and Tuesday it turned out that Florence veered north sooner than expected and the rain really didn't materialize in this area.  We probably could have started hiking again on Tuesday but waited until Wednesday.
Ruth Anne drove us back Tuesday night and we all went out for dinner in Hot Springs.  The trail runs right through the middle of town and businesses there really go out of their way to welcome hikers.  After a night in a hostel located in a beautiful old house built in the mid 1800s and a huge breakfast at the local diner, we headed south for the final push.","

This post may bore you if you have no interest in hiking gear and infuriate those of you who are gear heads.  If you fall into either of those categories you may want to stop reading right now.
It will anger hard core gear junkies because I am not going to give specs and comparisons of all the available gear.  I'm just going to write about my gear and what worked(and didn't work) for me.
Everything a hiker carries is a compromise between weight, comfort, and price.  You can carry a lot of comfortable things but pay the price in weight. There are ultra lightweight items that reduce the burden on your back but significantly reduce the weight of your wallet.  Here is a rundown of most of my gear:
Pack: Osprey Atmos 65 AG-- This is a very popular pack on the AT.  It isn't light but carries the weight well. AG stands for anti-gravity.  I only wish! The volume is 65 liters and it's true that you fill up whatever size pack you have so a smaller pack might have worked but I was happy with this one and it held up well.
Tent: I started with a Kelty? 2 person tent that weighed over 4 pounds.  This was too much. I switched to a Big Agnes Fly Creek HV 2 person tent that was just over 2 pounds so I saved some weight here.  I was very happy with the tent. It kept me dry in some heavy rain, it was easy to set up and had enough room for me and my pack.
Sleeping bag: I started with a zero degree rated bag from Outdoor Vitals.  The ratings are “survival” ratings. That means you would survive down to zero degrees but you might not be comfortable.  This was really more than I needed so I switched to a twenty degree bag in May and have been using it since then. On warm nights I slept on top and not in the bag.  I have a synthetic liner that can be washed. It keeps the bag cleaner and is enough by itself on warm nights. My bag isn't the lightest on the market and may be more than I needed but I have been warm and happy with my purchase.
Stove: MSR pocket rocket.  Light, small and reliable. 
Hiking poles: Outdoor Products sold by Walmart for $20.  First pair made it all the way to Maine but I bent them a couple of times during falls and straightened them out on trees so I thought it was best to get a new pair for $20.  A lot of people spend over $150 for carbon fiber poles and they sometimes break too.
Clothes:
Shirt: Rab Merino wool. They weave fibers from coconut husks in with the wool.  It is light, comfortable, dries quickly, and most importantly, doesn't smell!
Pants: I started with convertible long pants that would zip off at the bottom to become shorts.  I found that I rarely if ever needed the bottoms after April and switched to a pair of athletic shorts.
Underwear: Icebreaker Merino wool.  Again, no smell and quick drying.
Shoes: I'm on my fourth pair of shoes.  I started with Merrell Moab low cut shoes and liked them but eventually wore them out.  When I replaced them I got the same model except these were the waterproof version. My feet still got wet but the shoes stayed wet forever and this was bad for my feet.  My next pair was by Solomon. They were lighter but held dirt and moisture and caused terrible sores. Finally I found a pair by Oboz. All of the problems went away and I'll wear them the rest of the trip.
Socks: Darn Tough.  Best all around. Most hikers wear them.  Great warranty too.
There are a lot of other small things that I carry that I won't list here.  I do carry one heavy luxury item and that is a paperback book. I could read on my phone but it would use the battery too quickly so I have gone through many paperbacks.  I actually tear out the pages I've read and through them away to keep the weight down.

Tomorrow I will have 100 miles to finish my hike.  I'd like the last hundred to have a little more meaning so I'm asking everyone to support a cause and pledge a small amount of money per mile.  As I hike I'll know that every step I take is making a difference.  A small pledge such as 10 to 20 cents per mile will only be $10 to $20 dollars out of anyone's pocket but will add up quickly.  I have a suggestion below.  If you don't want to contribute to this particular GoFundMe then maybe the National Kidney Foundation or a local Kidney charity.https://www.gofundme.com/cnjv8...

Hostels give hikers a chance to rest, relax and start fresh the next day.Tomorrow night will be my last night sleeping on the trail.  I've slept in a lot of shelters.  For the most part they've kept me dry and moderately comfortable.  Most have a few mice scurrying around and some have a lot.  If they don't have mice they probably have a snake.  One or two of them were close enough to town to order pizza.  I've also slept in my tent a great deal.  I usually sleep better in the tent but don't like packing it up when wet so if it looks like rain I try to find a shelter.  Tomorrow I might try ""Cowboy camping"".  That is the same thing as sleeping under the stars without any tent or shelter.  I haven't slept this way yet so if the weather and the location is right I may give it a try.Friday I'll say goodbye to my last hiking partner.  Milo and I have hiked most of the southbound portion of the trail together.  We separated a couple of times when visits from significant others occurred but got back together further down the trail.  We got along well and helped each other with ideas and encouragement.  We've had many long and enjoyable discussions as we hiked and I hope to keep in touch with him in the future.  I've hiked and camped with too many wonderful people to list here but they have been the best part of the hike.  I especially want to mention a few others.  Pheriel was my first long term hiking partner.  He eventually had to leave the trail due to injuries.  We always thought that we'd meet back up at some point but it looks like it will have to be over a meal or a drink somewhere.  Griz taught me how to fight through the steep uphill sections of Pennsylvania.  She decided to go home but I sometimes grit my teeth and growl at steep climbs like she did.No Name helped keep my spirits up through the difficult sections of New Hampshire and Maine.  We went through the hardest part of the trail together.  He stopped for a while for employment reasons but came back and finished his hike by reaching the summit ok Katahdin.I'll be sending all of them and many others a message and a picture Friday when I get to the top of Springer Mountain and finish my hike.I'll save a final summation of my hike for a later post after I've had a little time to organize my thoughts.","

Furnace,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604125,"I'm home.  Well, I'm not home- home but I'm at my lake house.  My parents are here to welcome me home. Last night our good friends from the lake came for a welcome home dinner.  There were cards and cake and congratulations. There were hugs and stories and laughter. These are wonderful people and I realized how much I missed them.  It's good to be home.
A lot of people have asked me about best part or the worst part or the hardest part of the hike.  The scenery and views were awesome. The Flora and fauna were fantastic. I’ll miss the sunrises and sunsets, the flowers along the path, the still forests, the waterfalls, the chipmunks, the owls at night, the soaring peaks and the cool mountain streams.  But as I've said before, the people I met were probably the best part of the hike.
The hardest part is also the reason I have no desire to take another long hike.  I had sore feet. I had wet clothes and shoes. I fell. I bled. I was cold. I was hot.  I smelled bad and bathed infrequently. I was tired to the point of exhaustion. I ate repetitious and bland food.  I was often hungry. The list could go on and on but none of these things would keep me from going on another long hike.  No, the hardest part was being away from Ruth Anne.
I missed all of my friends and family but I never again want to be away from my wife for such a long time.  While I was gone she kept everything running smoothly at home. She supported me along the way and visited more frequently than I could have expected.  I never could have finished without her Every day I tried to at least send her a text because cell service wasn't usually good enough for a call. I would anxiously await her reply just to know she was okay.
 The hardest single moment on the trail wasn't climbing some steep mountain or slogging through a cold rainy day.  It was the morning in Vermont when she dropped me off after a two day visit. I had to walk away when all I really wanted to do was go home with her.  I had to walk quickly so my momentum would keep me going and so she couldn't see the tears in my eyes. 
Am I glad I did it? Yes.  Would I do something similar again?  Not without her!","
