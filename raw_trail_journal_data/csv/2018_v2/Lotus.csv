Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588139,"Thurs Day 73 4/25 I'm very controlling being that was letting Luke's last day I want to do something it was fun. So when we came off the mountain on Sunday they predicted a sunny day for Thursday. I chose to go down an hour and 45 minutes 2 Maccabees knob. I got a bit overwhelmed driving down looking to my left at the Ridgeline that I have walked the last couple weeks. When you're just doing 20-25 miles a day it doesn't seem that far. When you drive an hour and 45 minutes and look at the mountains that go on and on and on it seems like a pretty far distance. So far I walked 880 MI. That's starting to seem like a long way. I really only looked at this as one day hiking. Set a goal, hike for the day, eat, and go to bed. Really quite a simple short-term situation. It did seem like a long way to drive. We had a nice four mile hike up to Maccabees knob. It was a perfect day weather wise. We spent an hour at the knob. We took a lot of photos. It's a very impressive place. We met 6 other thru-hikers there.Â  The views are really impressive. Got back to the hotel at 6 did laundry packed watched the draft, and went to bed.","Th 311 parking

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588938,"Thurs Day 73 4/25 I'm very aware of it being Luke's last day. I want to do something that was fun. So when we came off the mountain on Sunday they predicted a sunny day for Thursday. I chose to go down an hour and 45 minutes to McAfees Knob. I got a bit overwhelmed driving down looking to my left at the Ridgeline that I have walked the last couple weeks. When you're just doing 20-25 miles a day it doesn't seem that far. Just get up do your hike get your water eat and go to bed . It's a Small World . When you drive an hour and 45 minutes and look at the mountains that go on and on and on it seems like a pretty far distance. So far I walked 880 MI. That's starting to seem like a long way. I really only looked at this as one day hiking. Set a goal hike for the day, eat, and go to bed. Really quite a simple short-term situation. It did seem like a long way to drive. The enormity of what I'm doing started to set in. This is a long hike. I mean this is a journey. It'll probably take 24 hours to drive from Katahdin Maine to Springer Mountain, Georgia. And that's with me driving 70 miles an hour. I walk 2 - 2 and 1/2 miles an hour. That's a lot of hours to hike 2,200 miles.
We had a nice four mile hike up to McAfees Knob. It was a perfect day weather wise. We spent an hour at the Knob. We took a lot of photos. It's a very impressive place. We met 6 other thru-hikers there. We had lots to talk about. One fellow talked about what I just gone through, you just push a little more and a little more in a little more to find your limits and what can you do. Well I found out what I can do and I'm going to just do it a little slower in a little easier. Cuz it's still 1400 miles to the end. We had a really great time, drove back, got in around 5, had dinner. Then we all went into serious organization and packing mode. Watched the NFL draft and went to bed ready to roll in the morning.","McAfee knob

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588960,"Day 74 4/26 As we started to go up into Shenandoah Mountain National Park the fog got extremely dense. Luke had to drive 20-25 miles an hour. As we drove into the park. We must have seen 20 or 30 deer spread out on our drive to where Luke was going to drop us off. It made for some tents driving as it seems there was a deer around every curve. After Luke dropped us off, he was going to continue on in the park to Big Meadow Wayside. There he would pick up Mel and drive her up to Front Royal where he was going to switch cars. Curtis and I I hit the trail at 8:15. It was pretty smooth hiking today. We went to our first wayside which is another name for a little restaurant store. That's what they call them and Shenandoah National Park. After we had lunch we start of hiking again. Curtis immediately spotted a bear. I spotted the two Clubs that were between us and the mama bear. We went back and told the supervisor at the wayside. She encourage us to just yell if the bear apporched otherwise quietly, carefully work our way past where the bear was cuz it was below the trail. We had a nice afternoon and rolled in I think around 2 o'clock. We were first to the shelter. Then a girl 22 came in who started March 15th and already caught up. She was hiking with her mother and father for the weekend. She was also hiking with a brace because she had a completely torn ACL. They were going to repair her knee after she finished her hike. Her dad was interested in pushing on, so after they had a quick bite to eat they headed out of the shelter. Slow Papa had come in He is 74. He takes care of his sick wife 10 months of the year. He then gets a 2 month break when he goes hikeing. He actually lives up near Tionesta, Pennsylvania in Warren Pennsylvania. So we had lots to talk about. Curtis built a nice fire. By 5 Curtis was laying down. By 8 pm four or five other hikers came in as well. They were all doing 20 25 mile days. Typically you're going to get in later like 7- 8 at night. We won't be seeing them again. I'm starting to see a real pattern of the 20 to 25 mile get it done hiker coming through. They can start as much as a month after me but there young and going full tilt. The interesting thing is they're often talking about their sore knees. There were two hiker from Gettysburg College. They were involved in the outdoor club . They were used to hiking with big packs as they took care of other people the one girl got up in the morning and wrapped her knee with an Ace bandage . The other one had shin splints . They were planning to make it 2 Gettysburg Pennsylvania in like a week. They talked about doing the four State Challenge, which is a 40-mile hike . You start in Virginia shoot through West Virginia, cover the 30 miles in Maryland on which 20 miles is very difficult rock surface and end up in Pennsylvania. Usually you started at midnight to give yourself 24 hours to make it through. I just laughed to myself. They're practically limping now. I don't think go get to Gettysburg on time. I don't think they'll do the four State Challenge either. I understand their thinking. At McAfee knob a through hiker explained it. You push yourself mentally you know you can do it. So you think of the scenarios where you can do it you will do it. Burn when it comes to doing it something goes wrong. I know cuz I just went through that. In my mind I was going to be able to do 30 miles a day 6 days a week. I was building up gradually and thought everything was going fine. I realize now I overlooked how tired I was. I remember saying I was having trouble starting in the morning. I couldn't get up to speed. I figured it was just a loss of focus. No it was my body telling me I was pushing too far too fast too hard. I was testing myself trying to meet a mental goal. I even fell asleep at lunch the day that my knee and my back said enough. But I couldn't see any of the symptoms because I didn't want to. I believed it was mind over matter and I could do this. Many times it works that way. I knew Curtis and Luke we're coming and we would be hiking smaller miles so I figured I would rest then. On the Appalachian Trail, 2000 miles just wears you down. There may be some Mind Over Matter on my journey to Maine. My knee and my back told me it does matter and we're done. I had to rest. If I didn't listen and rest, I would have had a hike ending overuse injury. I am impressed with how many people try to push through the pain and end up off the trail. With rest and gentleness, I am coming back into form with 10 to 15 miles a day. I'll just keep doing the 10 to 15 with Curtis as my knee rebounds. I fell asleep before they even moved away from the table.b","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588963,"Sat Day 75 4/27 Slept in. We're only planning 8.2 miles today. No sense in rushing off too early. Everybody was up getting ready. In the morning it's much quieter at a shelter. The culture is until the last person is up, out of their sleeping bag, we keep it pretty quiet. Watching the variety of breakfasts is such a hoot. Pop-Tarts are a big choice, dried fruit and a variety of powders poured into liquids. I had an apple and orange and a Kind bar. We left about 8:15. Curtis was actually ready before I was. We had a pretty mellow gentle hike for the first 5 miles. We stopped at a nice overlook two and a half hours in. The last three point seven miles was uphill to the Pinefield shelter. We got in at 1:15 first to the shelter. Just had a long feeding. Then some weekend hikers came in. I always say you can learn something from everyone you meet on the trail. They had lots of different gear things that I had not seen and really were quite pleasant section hikers. We had built up quite a fire when we got in. Curtis and I had brought in some long heavy 6 in tops of Tree Trunks. It took two of us to carry. So we have laid them across the fire to burn them in half so we can start feeding them in the fire better that way. So we really had quite the fire going. Our three section hikers were quite happy to see our fire. They had mushrooms and onions and other things in aluminum foil ready to cook on an open fire. So they were very happy to see such a nice bed of coals and good fire burning. After eating so much I was a little tired. I laid down and just stretched a little bit with my legs up towards the half ceiling in the shelter. Curtis made two trips to get water. Curtis is really getting the rhythm of this thru-hiking day. Really has been very very pleasant to be spending the time with Curtis. He's a bit out of his element but he's really open, positive, flexible. He's hip to picking up on what it takes to do this thru hiking on a day-to-day basis. Tonight it's supposed to go down to 31, 30 degrees. So we'll be sleeping with our water filter, our phones, our gas canisters, all these hard things to roll over in your sleeping bag . All for the fun and joy. I'm sleeping out in the woods. I just can't get enough of it. It has been very nice comradery with these three that came in. The temperature has vacillated today from cool, to so hot I just laid in the shelter to get out of the Sun, to back to cool, and as I said it's going to be cold tonight. Tomorrow we're looking to do a 12.2 hike. So far Curtis is feeling much better. He started one little blister today but his knees are feeling better and his groin is still tender but is not screaming at him. One of the hikers that joined us at the shelter was telling us about how rough 20 miles in Maryland is. The rocks that are just very hard to get firm footing on, you either twist your ankle or twist a knee. So much fun to look forward to. Last night they were talking about the 13.5 mile roller coaster right after you get out of West Virginia. It might have been right out of Virginia. They called the roller coaster and it is even the roller coaster on the guide, because it's just steep up and down, up and down, small up and down,up and down, up and down for 13.5 miles. So much fun and excitement to look forward to. Can't wait to see the roller coaster. A lot of talk of knees sprained ankles and back problems. One fellow who started on Tuesday in the 2 inch of rain had to have his buddy helped off the trail cuz his knee just blew up. Everyone is concerned how about holding up under the constant pressure of walking everyday. Like I said I'm going to go slower and smaller. So Curtis joining me is really quite a blessing. I have every reason to go slower and gentler. My higher power works in mysterious ways some more obvious than others. I'm really hoping that this slower Pace can get Curtis adopted and that he can stay till June like he would like to. It's really quite nice to have this unexpected, unplanned, extended period of time to spend with Curtis. Like everybody on the trail that I've Hiked with day after day, you end up with much more intimate detailed serious conversations. Somehow I just can't small talk and hike it's just too much work. If I'm going to talk at all I might as well talk about something real. It seems It's that way with everybody. I was odf doing my blog. When I got back to the shelter it was a very social place. There were probably nine people around the table. The crew off 3 section hikers had cooked onions mushrooms and potatoes in tin foil around the fire. They had more than enough and were offer them to everybody. Curtis and I got one whole tin foil package to share between the two of us. A very nice additional little feeding. A couple of thru hikers came in late one had a dog and they were brothers from California. They thought that tin of hot onions potatoes and mushrooms was a gift from God. Man you walk in and get offered a hot meal well seasoned verytasty. And then another guy came in I forget his name and he's got the leftovers from that. But there was a lot of spirited discussion about going into to Washington from Harpers Ferry there's a commuter train and Amtrak train. After all the mushrooms got cleared away,Curtis and I were already in our our bags. They broke out the giant marshmellos. It seemed like Christmas on the AT. Then one of the guys of the section hikers broke out a bottle of Jim Beam. the other thru hikers knew it was all a fantasy. They all enjoy the unexpected treatsfor a while. It was quite a a pleasant evening. Around 9 people finally crashed out and went to bed. It was a very nice group of guys whether they were section or through hiking and one guy had a fabulous dog. Curtis really enjoyed his experience with the dog. Super well trained dog.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589035,"folks im not sure about dates and sequencesÂ  i remember the experiences.Â  Â on the trail everything is in the present moment. There are no dates days of the week or hours of the day. So it gets to be a blur when I try to make it all line up perfectly. Sorry about thatSun Day 76 4/28 Heading to Bear Fence Mountain hut. We started out pretty early with our headlamps. As we crested High Top Mountain there was ice on the trail. There was a cold wind blowing and we didn't spend a lot of time enjoying the view at the top. Mush, who had the dog, who was Brothers with Gandopho the Mystic passed us on the trail with his dog. I don't think I want to take a dog but this was a very good husky. We had a nice smooth hiking pace. Curtis is really getting into a nice Groove. I let him lead and set the pace whatever is right for him. He was anxious because at this time we weren't carrying much food at all. In his words raisins, a few bars, and an apple were not going to cut it for his dinner. We were hiking towards the Lewis Mountain Store. They didn't have a Wayside which would be defined as having hot food. When we got near it got very confusing. We came to a marker that said we were two miles away from the store. We hiked One Direction for maybe two tenths of a mile it was wrong. We asked somebody and at first they said the store was closed and then they said they didn't know where the store was. I saw an American flag flying. I figured that was a sign of a store. The Lewis mountain camp ground area was originally designed to be a colored only section. Secretary Eckels was a ardent civil rights supporter. His position was a national park should not be segregated in 1937. He was overruled because Virginia was a Jim Crow state and discriminated against blacks. So the Lewis Campground was designated the colored Campground. It became a very popular destination for many prominent blacks. It was a social Center outside of Washington DC. Over time the word got out that the food was better in the black Campground dining hall. Whites were clamoring to eat at the Lewis Mountain dining hall because of the food. So Eckel said if the whites want to integrate the colored campgrounds voluntarily we will let them. A couple presidents of the United States also visited Lewis Campground. Eckels did get the park intsgrated 13 years before VA. Changed their laws in 1963
We did find the store. It was open. The proprietor was from New Jersey. We had a great time in this store. They had lots of different food that we liked as well as camping gear. It was all good. He also told us to fill up our water because the water at the campsite had heavy metals in it. He told us the quick way to get back to the trail. The campsite was only Nineteen Hundred yards away. So Curtis was happy. We had food. We made our way to the Bear Fence mountain hut. Papa Bear came in. He's a Ridge Runner paid to be the eyes and ears for the for the public Rangers. There's was also a fellow from New Hampshire there is well. One of the park rangers did come in looking for Papa Bear but he was up setting up his tent. The fellow from New Hampshire was a southbounder. He had crossed paths with Mush and his dog. He put in a big complaint about how mush did not have his dog on a leash. He wanted the ranger to make an example of him. I had to chirp in that was a great dog super well trained. I spent the spent the night in a shelter with that dog the night before. He was fabulous. Curtis jumped in. He said it was the best trained dog he had ever seen in his life. The ranger didn't really take the whole conversation that seriously. She was very nice. I will say that the Rangers are heavily equipped and fully armed and wearing bulletproof vests. I guess one of the bigger challenge is poachers of animals or Forest resources. Down here everybody has a gun. So Papa Bear through Heights the AT 2 times all the way. Now he works for 6 months each year 5 days a week walking back and forth on a section of the trail. He is the eyes and ears for the rsngers. He was a wealth of knowledge. He told us at the next Shelter Rock Spring Hut to make sure to put our food in the bear box not on the pole. He showed us his food bag that the raccoon had climbed up the metal pole and ripped open and got the food out of. The guy from New Hampshire ended up getting sick from his dinner and threw up. We didn't see any more of him and that was fine with us. One person came in late name Gandolfo. A different Gandalfo than mush's brother. He was pretty cool kicking big miles. We were all in bed before it was dark.","Hightop hut

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589037,"Mon Day 77 4/29 with a nice morning the weather was a little warmer. The climbs today were of the gradual nature and the trail was very accommodating. By that I mean there weren't a lot of loose rocks. It was fairly smooth footing and gentle climbs and descents. We got to the Big Meadows Wayside fairly quickly. We ordered hot food and plugged in our Electronics. Curtis got some news. He'd have to head home to take care of some business matters. Papa Bear came in soon after us. We asked him about shuttle services up to Front Royal. He didn't have any answers but he tried hard to be helpful. I ended up calling Mel. Luke had given her a ride to Front Royal on Friday. Luke told me that it took him three and a half hours to drive through the park after he picked up Mel. It was foggy and he had seen 25 different clusters of deer. Mel got right back to me and texted me a list of shuttle drivers. That's how it seems to work. You help people. They help people. Everybody's helping everybody else. You never know when you're the one who's going to need the help. So we got to Big Meadows Wayside around 11. The shuttle came at 3:30. I immediately commenced to head out towards Rock Spring Hut. As I was packing up outside the Wayside a waitress came out with a bag of 10 sandwiches. Would you like these. They were all meat based sandwiches and being a vegetarian I said of course thank you very much. I knew I'd find somebody down the road who would love to have a sandwich delivered. It was a nice hike to Rock Springs with lots of view spots. Gandalfo caught up to me at a view spot. I asked him if he'd like a sandwich. He was rather surprised. He said I'm a through hiker. I'm always hungry. He wondered why was a thru hiker with a pack doing Trail Magic. He ended up eating two sandwiches right there at the view spot. I hiked on to Rock Springs. When I arrived there were eight college kids there for a 4 day hike in the park. 6 Girls 2 Guys. They were stunned as well when I put the sandwiches on the table and said anybody want one. They consume five of the sandwiches. I proceeded to get setup and take care of my water retrieval, eating, and getting my sleeping area prepared. While i was eating my cheese sandwich there was another couple from North Carolina who do three big trips a year. They were very interesting. They are trying different gear and food always thinking to prepare for their next trip. 13 came in. He got that name because he has a base pack wieght of 13 lb and was a 1300 hiker to register for the AT. 13 was very excited and ate the remaining three sandwiches. He works at minimizing pack weight. So three extra sandwiches that he didn't have to carry anywhere was a big deal to him. We all got to bed around 9. The girls were quite noisy. when I woke up later that night I realized 13 was gone. He's hiked across Australia and New Zealand. He's hike long distances in Canada. He probably didn't like the noise.","13.t

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589069,"Tues day 78 4/30 heading to Pass Mountain hut,13.1 miles. During the night, I had noticed 13 left. When I got up in the morning and was outside the shelter I realize 13 just moved behind the shelter. He was sleeping under the stars. I was up at 4. I was drinking my 2 L of water and having 2 honey and oats Nature Valley bars. I'm noticing that with the warmer temperatures it's so much easier to drink 2 liters of warm water. It was a struggle before drinking 2 liters of cold water and going out in the cold. I was on the Trail by 5 a.m. Again there was spectacular views all along this nice gradual up and down Trail. I didn't really feel a lot of the up. I wasn't carrying any water again because of the weight. I made it to my water replenishment locations feeling very good. I came to a sign indicating I was approaching Mary's Rock. There's a significant rock formation it's named Mary's Rock. Of course it started a lot of thoughts. One of them was that it was nice that Mary had a rock in Shenandoah National Park named after her. She would have enjoyed knowing that.
There was one shelter before the one I was hiking to. The first shelter had a 0.3 steep decline to get water. Then you had to carry your water up three tenths of a mile. I skipped that shelter and hiked another four miles to get to the next shelter Pass Mt. Hut. On the way I came across a volunteer hiking up with a long hand saw. He was doing Trail maintenance. He told me that the original architect of the AT maintained this section of Trail originally. After many others it was now his responsibilities and honor to try and keep the trail clear of fallen trees. I told him that one looked extremely dangerous to me. It seems to be hanging on by a thread of a piece of wood. There was another one probably a mile before that northbound that had four trunks over the trail that you would sneak under. The 4 trunks blocked me from seeing the fifth one. I came up under it. I hit my head square on the top. It dropped me to my knees. That was a stinger. I saw my second snake of the trip as well. 1 mile before the shelter I was hiking to Pass Mountain hut. I stopped at a visitor center. I replenished fluids drinking a liter of water and ate a bar. I'm always trying to hydrate.
When I got to the Pass Mountain Hut Gundolph was already there setting up his tent. He was getting set up then hiking back to Thornton Gap and getting a ride into town to spend the evening with his friend to have dinner. So I have the shelter to myself until about 8. I was just getting ready the crash, doing my stretches when Moon came in. Moon started March the 5th. He said that two other hikers would be coming Traveler and Honey. Honey was the first to show up. Traveler was next in. An Australian chap. Very pleasant people. They're hiking big miles. They plan to be in Harpers Ferry by Saturday afternoon. I won't get there until Tuesday. Honey and Moon got married March 5/3 and started the trail March 5th. Hence the trail names HoneyMoon. I was asleep before they all settled in.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589071,"Thurs Day 80 5/29 I woke up to the sounds of the late arrival packing up. It was 4 a.m. I am up immediately. Up because I wanted to be on the trail by 5. I wanted to be finished and in Front Royal by noon at least. I would get in earlier, but I didn't think I'd be able to check in earlier. I was on the trail by 5 a.m. I drink 2 leaders of water. My first water replenishment would be six and a half miles in. It was a beautiful morning. I had some great views as the sun was rising. Just like Papa Bear had said my phone started chirping on a western facing summit. I took a break. I was 4 miles in so I had a little snack. I try to eat every 2 hours or so. Lets me keep putting fuel into the tank. I'll be taking a break for lunch and is only looking like a 6-6 and a half hour day. Now I've been hiking at a rate of between two and two and a half miles per hour. I'm really not, I don't want to even push three three and a half or 4 miles an hour anymore. I think that's some of what over stressed my knee. It felt great when I was cranking out the miles and flying over the trail but not at the price of my knee. It was great watching the Sun start to come across the mountain behind me and illuminate the mountain in front of me. It was a good morning for nice views. It really helps when the sun shines in terms of improving the visibility. The first couple weeks it rained everyday never saw the sun. Then in March five major snow storms not a lot of sun. Here we are on the verge of May the sun is starting to shine. Again it was a fine day of hiking. I estimated my arrival time at Front Royal to be 11:30 a.m. At the six and a half mile mark I came to the spring where I planned to get water. As I approached the water I realized there was an adult black bear rooting through the rocks in the stream and eating something from under the rocks. There were two Cubs on the far side of the ravine on the opposite side. So the mama bear was between myself and the Cubs. She behaved much differently then the last time I saw a Mama Bear. In this situation she was directly between myself and her Cubs. The Cubs were higher up on the valley. I was no threat at all. She glanced at me but then went back to turning over rocks and eating something for the next 20 minutes. I took a lot of pictures. I drank a liter and a half of nice Cold Spring Water, after she moseyed up the Mountainside. I ate my very last bar. I would get into Front Royal caring no food at all. That's how it's supposed to work. When I reached the edge of Shenandoah National Park there was a fellow trying to self register. He said he hiked the AT two years ago, the whole trail with his mother. He said today his base pack weight was three and a half pounds period. With four days of food it was 11 and a half pounds. He's traveling light. People laugh when I say I'm trying to get my pack weight down. Every ounce every gram is important. As I left the park boundary it was a very steep decline trail. It was another 3 MI out to Route 522. It was really warming up. I could see that at the lower elevations the green ground cover was coming into full leaf. The trees were also leafing out and providing some shade on the trail which was much appreciated. The last half a mile of the 13 and a half miles did seem to dry a little bit. I was hot and tired. The temperature was projected into the 90s and unprotected by any leaf canopy it was incredibly hot on the trail. On Sunday and Monday there was Ice at the summit on the trail. Here it was Thursday in the 90s. Very tough for the body to adapt or aclimatetise. It was 10 minutes of hitchhiking in direct sun before somebody picked me up and drove me into town. I checked in, got in my room and took a shower. I was only carrying one pair of pants so I looked in the hiker box and found a woman's hiking top. It made for a very nice skirt so I could do my laundry. Did I say I was very hot and tired. After 5 days of hiking I was ready for a break. I don't know whether it's the Heat or the 970 miles. I seem a little more tired these days. I had made it to Rt. 522, the road into Front Royal at 11:34. Around 5, I ventured out into the streets. It was melting hot. I took a walk down Main Street. Lot of nice old structures on Main Street. I had eaten dinner in a Thai restaur nkÃ±ant. I stopped and had some kind of cheese sandwich in a coffee shop and then I stopped and had some other kind of sandwich and a bowl of mac and cheese. I topped that off with two scoops of ice cream on the way back to the hotel. There were some really nice wood work to be seen. I took pictures of tables in the coffee shop.

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589556,"Sat Day 82 5/5 I went shopping hungry last night, never a good plan. I wonder if I packed too much food for 3 nights and 4 days. We'll find out because I'm going to be eating voraciously the first two days out. I'll just trying to lighten my pack by eating all the food. Up at 3, called the Yellow Cab at 4, on the trail at 4:10.
My goal today is Dick's Dome shelter, mile 984.9. Mr Jimmy says that it can get flooded in heavy rains and be difficult to actually get to the shelter. We'll see how that plays out. It is supposed to rain today. It's a 15 mile plan today. I hike the first two hours by headlamp. The Smithsonian Institute maintains a large fenced area for different animals for the Smithsonian zoo in Washington. Once a year they let the locals in to see the animals.
It's a very nice cool temperature when I start to hike. There's a smattering of rain. I do have my rain cover on my pack. It's a nice morning. I make the first climb easily. I come to a sign that says spring. I'm not sure how far you have to go. I take a few steps down to see. You have to take like 25 steps and there is the water. It's 6:30 so I take a break. I eat a lage muffin and drink a liter and a half of water. My next break is 10:15 I'm past the Manassas gap shelter. There was an opportunity for water there but I passed it. I come accross 2 women who had hiked the roller coaster in the two 90 degree days. We chatted for a bit you're tough if you like the roller coaster at 90 + degrees. They asked about how small my pack was. We talked about pack weight. I am now trying to hack the weight down. I came through the forest which is loaded with Trillium flowers very pretty three leaf flowers, with 3 pedal flowers coming out of three leaves. Come in a variety of pink, white, and rose. It's pretty much as far back along the trail. I can see the Forest floor is loaded with them, very nice. I had one of my muffins and my 2nd break.
Now I'm having a big Honey Chrisp Apple. Going to eat as much as I can, when I get to the shelter. I an now taking some longer brakes. At the first break there was a Boy Scout Troop just down from the spring. The leader of the scout come up to the spring. I spent probably a half hour maybe 40 minutes. We're just chatting about gear and camping and hiking.
Dennis Wilson Trail Magic plastic tote. Drank a liter of Gatorade. I stopped at Virginia route 55 Manassas gap, and chatted with a guy getting ready to do his bike trip. He talked about how 20 years ago he could go out his door or not see a car. Now he has to drive all the way out here and he still worried about the traffic. We had a nice chat about bikings. Also saw a nice suspension bridge that had stone a buttisies on the banks and steel guridders. It was the first time I had seen a Bridge built like that for foot traffic on the trail.
Got to Dickies dome at 5 after 12. It's a cool day perfect hiking day. I hike the two tenths of a mile down to Dickies dome. There is a wide stream that goes right 10ft maybe 15 ft from the shelter. So it could get where was too wet to get in here. The small shelter is a G ADESA Dome. I'm alone, and get water. I'm going to comence to eat a lot of food make my pack lighter first day out. First i sleep for an hour. You eat the most food on day one. You don't want to eat the same amount each day. Well I am pleased with the amount of food that I ate today. I am staying at Dick's Dome, which was built in 1983. I realized that 2 tenths of a mile away there was a beautiful new shelter built by the Potomac Trail Club. One of the nicest shelter that I stayed in the whole 11 weeks. Had a quite afternoon of listening to songbirds today. The afternoon was very nice. I was alone. No one came to the shelter. Trying that my bibbi bag tonight n that's a work in progress. I tried not using my sleeping bag to see if I would be warm enough to send the bag of home. I could not. I could see my breath this morning when I woke the next day. Really a very pleasant moment to reflect all day.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589557,"Sun Day 83 5/6 10 hours sleep i slept from 7 p.m. To 5 a.m. I did have to get up for times 4 for hydration release. I woke up to an owl orchstra. I have big breakfast and apple, two packs of bars, 2 cheese sticks.
Today will be a challenging day. I'm going to do 15 miles. The last 7 will be the beginning of a 13 and 1/2 mile stretch called the Roller Coaster. It's called that because it's an endless set of steep up and downs for 13 1/2 miles. Typically on a 14 15 mi day I would estimate seven and a half hours. Today I'm going to estimate eight and a half to 9 hours.
I arrived at the Sam Moore shelter 8 hours and 15 minutes later. Arrived at 3:15. There was some steep up but it was actually very nice. Before lunch the 8 miles before the Roller Coaster, the forest was shrouded it in a fog but rather low cloud ceiling. It was very quiet with only the song Birds singing. The first growth has come out. There's green everywhere. Depends somewhat one what east-west north or south facing slope you're on. But one in particular was just completely full right up to the trail. You can only see 10 15 ft into the woods. I'm very glad I started when I did because up till now the last 11 weeks I've been able to see the whole Valley where the whole mountainside with no ground cover to hide it.
So I passed a thousand mile mark today. That is some kind of accomplishment. My knee is a little tired but it's not screaming at me. I think if I just played a long at 15 to 18 mi a day all will be well.
When I got to the shelter there was no one there. So I got my water, drank endoces, and put my feet up against the wall 20 minutes. This is new being able to work on my blog on the same day as it's happening. Couple factors, one it is warm enough for me to hold my phone and have my hands not in gloves. 2 I'm not doing as many miles so I have a little more time and energy. When you're doing 25 miles and it takes a 12 hours. There is not alot of other hours in the day. You're also just exhausted from doing 25 miles. It also is encouraging me because everytime I go to upload now it works.","Dickies Dome

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590035,"Mon Day 84 5/7 so I was all alone in the shelter all night. It rained incredibly hard during the night. Woke up and got out onto the trail by 6 a.m. Just like Papa Bear had said there was receptions for AT&T on a western facing Summit. As I was going across one of the summits I saw somebody on the phone. I asked him. He said his carrier was AT&T. I spent an hour planning, organizing, and calling to connect with Curtis's coming back on the trail and planning the next 8 days. It's amazing how much time it takes in planning and all you're doing is walking.
It started to rain very hard as I was walking on the second half of the roller coaster. It started raining right away as soon as I start it. That adds to the slipperiness of the roots and the rocks. That was people's comments later it was how unstable the Rocks were. It made the roller coaster so difficult. Then it cleared away It stopped raining and everything was good. Finish out the the roller coaster. I was looking for the last water there was a water before the West Virginia Virginia border as well as one after. I walked past the one before, didn't even see the West Virginia, Virginia border. I knew when I got to that next water I was getting water no matter what. Reboot was there getting water as well. I took a break. I ate some snacks and drank 2 liters of water. The next seven miles to the shelter was waterless.
The last little bit before the shelter, maybe a half a mile, I hooked onto the back end of three young 22 year olds. Chimney was from Fishtown. These were a nice group of young guys who is going to school with Reckless Morty although they didn't know him that well. They had hiked two days with him. Reckless is now heading into New York. There was water at the shelter. It was a very nice shelter with a solid quarter mile down a steep hill to get water. I kept my normal routine, another pack explosion, which means dumping everything out of my pack, keeping my boots on, and hiking down to the water with my trekking poles. I walked down with spice from Minnesota. She's a 45 year old yoga instructor. That is what she described herself as. She runs 15 miles a day. She is ridiculously fit. She hikes 12 hours a day typically, and does 20 to 25 MI. She got some bad news just before the shelter on the phone. She lost focused, tripped and gashed up her knee. While we are down getting water she washed off the blood on her leg. Didn't look too bad actually. She was a tough independent woman and didn't want any help. This was a fun bunch. We had a nice evening at the shelter. They were heavy hiker cranking out big miles everyday. They hung their food bags and were in their sleeping bags before I was. Quite an accomplishment. This looks like a good group to be in the shelter with. There was one older guy as well from Washington State. We pretty much filled the shelter from wall to wall. I was lucky enough to get the older guy from Washington State. He snored and thrashed incredibly. I just took my stuff out onto the deck and slept Under the Stars even though it might rain. Around 10 the two guys who they said might be joining us pulled in. They just finished the dirty 30. They were quiet respectful. One took my spot in the shelter in the other went to sleep on the deck. around two in the morning it started to rain. So I just took my stuff down to the eating area and slept on a picnic table that was under a shelter. Had a great night sleep on that picnic table didn't hear a thing.","Sam Moore shelter

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590038,"Tues Day 85 5/8 up at 5 getting ready. Spice came down by the picnic table cuz I was already up. She didn't want to disturb the Sleeping Beauties. We had a pretty intense personal conversation about things going on most recently in her life but how some parallels some things in my life. Spices verison of yoga instruction involves working with professional athletes of the Minnesota Vikings the women's professional basketball league and the Wild. She really was a competent professional healer. The shelter emptied out pretty quickly. I left by 6:15 after Spice had already gone. The rest of the Young Guns pushed pasted me soon enough. I pulled into Harpers Ferry at 10 a.m. in the morning. I checked in at the Appalachian Conservatory headquarters. I was number 124 to register at the halfway point. Of the estimated 4000 people who will attempt the trail this year, less than 1000 will finish. I feel pretty good being number 124. It feels like there's every opportunity to be in that thousand to finish if I just don't push too hard. Doing 15 miles a day seems very doable. Especially when you've done 25's and a 33 when I had to. It was very busy at the AT office. A lot of people were taking off from here and doing what they call Flip Flop. That means starting in the middle and go towards an end. Friday morning they had a total of 80 registered. Ultra woman came in. I ended up going to lunch with her. She's really training for 3 - 200 MI Races 30 days apart. So she pushes hard for 4 days and then goes light for two or three. She pretty much stays to herself cuz she's here to train. She just got back from running a race in the desert at 95 degrees. She said it was tough going from the snow into 95 degree weather. Her body hadn't acclimated yet. Of the 40 teams that entered, her team came in 12. It was a partner's race which means you have to stay with your partner or you're disqualified. It was an 82 Mi race in the desert. This woman is an athletic monster. She's working this as they say ""she's hiking her own hike."" I spent the afternoon in town. I ate three different times waiting for Luke and Curtis to get into town. They arrived Curtis has forgotten to return his Flash Pad. That'll make it tough to sleep on the hardwood. We were eating next to the Outfitters so I jumped over and got us a foam pad. Luke dropped us off the hostel. We said we wanted to go to bed by 7. Just getting organized and ready to go it was 10:30 before we turned out the light. All we're going to do is walk in the woods. Why does it take so long to get organized and ready? It was good for Curtis to see what a hostel was like and experience that culture. Curtis sat for a while with other hikers as they talked about their experiences on the trail. It's good for Curtis to hear other people's interpretations of the trail other than mine.","

So it was a bit of a day of climbing but not a terrible day at all. Sections of the trail were very smooth. Others were the standard rocky difficult struggle. We took a break around 9. Curtis was feeling pretty well. Took another break around 12. The last half an hour or so before we got to the Rocky Run shelter Curtis' feet started to let him know they were done. So when we got into the shelter Curtis put his feet up. I hiked another tenth of a mile down to get water. The temperature was very mild. If you are in direct sun it could get hot but if you are in any kind of shade there was a light Breeze. It was just about perfect. Honeymoon and Traveler stopped in at the shelter. They just took a quick break to regroup and headed off to the next shelter. It was pretty quiet at the shelter. Curtis laid down around 5 to rest. We have a light day planned for tomorrow. It is supposed to pour rain. Curtis feels pretty good in terms of his knee and any other real pain. Your feet get tired and swell up. It takes awhile for them to get used to doing this kind of mileage. We did 13.5 today. I am feeling pretty good myself. I haven't taken any ibuprofen for 3 days. My knees are liking less mileage. It's a different experience when you're not pushing big miles.
Shark Bait just rolled in. He is averaging 22 miles a day. Then a couple who started 2 days ago in Harpers Ferry rolled in as well. They did 700 miles 2 years ago. They were very pleasent. Kind of a perfect weather evening. Cooler temp. Light wind, song birds calling back and forth. A soft quiet evening in the woods.","

Our goal was Pine Knob shelter seven and a half miles away. It was a fairly easy day. Some sections of rock. Mostly a lot of smooth walking as well. We stopped at the Washington Memorial. We had a nice chat for about 30 minutes with the retired pharmacist who was a seasonal Ranger there. Was quite a solid Rock of a tower they built for Washington Memorial. We got to Pine Knob around 2. we did cross both Route 40 and we went over Route 40 and under route 70. We met She Beast. She has a hundred and forty miles to go to finish her thru hike at Big Meadows in the Shenandoah. She was pretty impressive. We have a variety of other section hikers and through hikers in the shelter coming and going. I'm taking a break. I'm staying the night. Will be in Pennsylvania in two days. I've now hiked through Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia and finishing Maryland. Took five states to get halfway. 9 states to go for the other half.

Curtis and I got on the trail by 5 a.m. We got to the Maryland- Pennsylvania border around 7:30. Took us awhile to find which way to go to town. There was no sign towards any towns. We came out at the Maryland-Pennsylvania Park . We finally got picked up hitchhiking. He dropped us right off at Walmart. I plugged my phone in at the subway and went shopping at Walmart. Curtis got all his food together for the week. He plugged his phone in. He hasn't looked at his phone in 4 days. There was a message from his training boss saying that everything was approved. He wants Curtis to start working on Monday. So we took some time figuring out how to get Curtis back to Jersey. By 12, I had uploaded four new segments on my trailjournals. We had organized the ride for Curtis. We spent four and a half hours at Walmart. I headed out into the Noonday Sun. I was back on my own again It was broiling hot, heading to 90+ degrees. I felt like I was baking standing on the asphalt hitchhiking. I was lucky and got a quick hitchhike ride back to the trail. I was surprised when the car pulled over. It was a small car and already had four people in it. Is the wife jumped out and got in the backseat with the two older adult children. The floor was 3 inches of trash and empty rappers. They were wonderful people. Said they pick up hikers all the time. One fourth of July they had a whole bunch of them camping out in their yard.
To beat the heat, at every water source I would soak my head. I would wrap a large wet rag around my neck letting cold water drip down the front of my shirt and back. When I do a complete job my pants are getting wet as well. The last 6 miles were melt down hot with no water. My neck rag dried out within the first half-hour. The first mile was a steep uphill climb. There's a reason I don't like to hike after 12 in the hot weather. I was already fried after a mile. It was a more gradual uphill the next 5 miles. It was a hot hard 5 miles. It's this type of situations that makes you wonder why you're doing this. The sweat is in your eyes, your pants are sweat glued to your legs. I am pretty uncomfortable in my journey uphill.
I was carrying a liter of water. The next shelter was 0.3 tenths steep downhill and then another a half a mile down hill to water. So I was really not drinking the leiter I was carrying. I was just planning ahead for the next day. I would drink this leiter of water I was carrying in the morning before I took off. I generally try to hike from one water source, drink, camel up, then carry no water to the next water. Hiked a total of 15 more miles and caught up and the crew from last night. There were 2 small shelters at Tumbling Run Shelter. Chimney and three of his buddies filled one. There was a brother and sister and a guy that had too much to drink and was passed out in the other. He was snoring like a freight train. That was my spot right next to him. I threw down my Tyvek. I woke him up. He went right back to sleep. Went back to hang out with Chimney and that crew to socialize. Somebody else came in. He was going to be able to get a spot in Chimney's shelter after they had told me originally the shelter was full. I quickly ran back got my stuff from the other shelter and took that spot in Chimney's shelter. I generiously gave the new guy who just came in the fourth spot in the shelter I just left. I was the one squeezed in as a fifth in the shelter. Two more people came in and both squeezed into that other shelter. The foursome became 6. In bed whether the culture is there's always room for one more in the shelter. The last woman's name was Squeeze. She comes in late and squeezes into full shelters. That's how she got her name. It started raining by 6:30. It rained super hard. Everyone in my shelter was asleep by 7. The other shelter, I could hear them still talkin on into the Night. It's all business with the crew in the shelter I am sleeping in. They're up and gone by 6:30 am at the latest.

The intoxicated fellow had said leave any extra food in the bear box. So I left two boxes of raisins 2 Power Bars, half a pound of cheese. Today was pretty cool after the rain last night so it was a good walking weather. The day was not particularly eventful. However I did come across late in the day Hobbit and his daughter, Echo. Echo is 24 years a captain in the Navy stationed in Hawaii. She is very much enjoying spending her time with her father on his third through hike. Hobbit hiked the first time, I think in 1989, 30 years ago or 88 but I'm not sure. Echo was quite a delight. I offered to take a picture of them together on a bridge. She was touched. She said he doesn't like photos so much. It was 19 miles to the Birch Run shelter. There were four of us in the shelter that night with lots of rain. I spent a lot of time talking to Sandals who is a hammocker. He sleeps suspended between two trees. I'm trying to learn about hammocks. I thought trekking poles were geeky until I used them. Now I know I was just foolish all those years. It may be the same with a hammock I just haven't tried it yet. Sandals got his name because he hikes the trail in sandals. They are the only shoes he has. Another fella Torque is trying a thru-hike for a second time. 2 years ago he ended up in the hospital with lots of big problems and months of hospitalization. He's 65 and giving it one last shot. Hobbit was in his sleeping bag by 6:30. There were four in our shelter but 4 others for in tents or hammocks. The others outside the shelter we're up later talkin socializing and enjoying each other. Hobbit knew hiker midnight and was making the most of the hours of sleep he could have. He's slowed down from doing 20 mile days to 10 mile days when is daughter came. Echo was carrying a very heavy pack. You have to carry a pack for a couple weeks before you just get worn out and get rid of some of that stuff that's just too heavy. Everybody can carry it for a week or two and it's no big deal. But you carry it for a couple months and you start thinking an ounce is a pound and a pound is way too much.","Rocky Mt. Shelter

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590601,"Mon Day 91 5/14 I was up at 4 and ready to be on the trail by 5. Echo got up and gave me a bar for breakfast. She was worried I didn't have enough food. I was running pretty light on food and I hadn't eaten that much the night before. The trail was a river from the night before. Hiking by headlamp in the dark it is very hard to tell how deep the water is on the trail. Sometimes you realize that the waters is way to deep. The trail is Rocky and wet. Soon after I left the Toms Run shelter I came to this big sign. It said this was the halfway point. It was raining. I started to walk past but said no I'm going to take a picture of this sign in the rain. It's equally 1090.5 miles to Katahdin, Maine and South to Springer Mountain, Georgia. This is the mathematical center, halfway point. So that started me thinking. When you're on a massive undertaking thinking is not recommended. So it's taking me 90 days, 90 tough challenging, hard days to get halfway. I don't even want to think about the next half. I really stayed very much in the moment so far. I may think of a 5-day plan but really I'm just doing one day at a time. I've done a series of one day hikes. I get up in the morning. I have a goal in mind. I make my goal. I filter my water, eat my dinner, socialize a little, and get to sleep. The next morning I get up and do it again. I often start at 5 a.m. in the morning. It's a simple life, a simple plan and I can wrap my head around that. Two think that I've hiked a thousand 90 miles is a little overwhelming. It's a whole lot of overwhelming to think I'm going to hike another thousand 90 miles. This is been a very challenging endeavor. I know my knee is bouncing back. I'm still on my feet but this is a challenging Adventure. So I try not to think of the bigger picture. I have a month to go before I take a trip to Alaska with my sister, Susan. I figure I'll be off the trail for 3 weeks. Then I'll have August, September and two weeks in October hopefully to finish. I try not to think about the bigger picture. It's too big for me.
When Curtis was with me, I had planned to do this section to Boiling Springs in 5 days. Without him, I plan to do this section in 3 days. This was the third day and Boiling Springs was 23 and a half miles away. The day started underwater with a lot of rocks. The sharp 2 inch square rocks, the rocks that stick a half an inch out of the dirt that hurt your the ball of your foot when you walk on them and just a jumble of loose rocks a half inch to 3 inch big on the trail. Today I was in for a variety of trail surfaces. It started out the first four miles a very rough Rocky Trail surface. I didn't know whether my feet would handle 23 and 1/2 miles of this Sharp Jagged kind of Trail surface. Sometimes the balls of my feet get so sensitive just standing up is painful. They call it Hiker Hobble. There was plenty of water sources that I could hike to. So I was caring no food practically and no water. An hour into the hike I came across a Gatorade Trail Magic. So I ate my last bar my last Apple and drank the Gatorade. There were gradual up and down climbs which are the kind I like. There was a stretch that was long and straight through the forest that was perfect, no rocks, no roots just perfect. I saw that guide that there was a rocky scramble ahead. I had my mind in my a rocky scramble that I done before, which is maybe 30 ft wide of all rocks anywhere from 6 in to 3 ft big. You just scramble from one Rock to another. It's very easy to get lost on a rock scramble because there's no beaten path, along in these rocks it's a difficult run. When I got to this Rocky scramble, the Rock's were the size of cars. There were times I couldn't use my trekking poles and had to use my hands to climb up. Everything was wet and moss-covered slippery. There was one time I literally had to slide down the face of the rock 6ft to land on the next Rock. This was a very difficult section and the trail maintainers knew it. Some of the blazes were only 10 feet apart and there were literally painted arrows that pointed you the way around certain rocks. You could make a 270 degree turn as you worked your way through this Rocky Scramble. This really slowed me down. The rain had stopped and the cool morning had given way to hot sun. I was in the trees most of the way so it wasn't so bad. Then I came to a section I had heard about but didn't know when I would get there. I probably walked 2 miles through plowed fields of AT maintained lands. Now this was after 12 noon. The sun was hot and I was cooking as I walked. I can tell I am going to have to avoid these hot afternoons. I just don't have what it takes to hike in the heat. I'm just going to have to be smart about it. I get up earlier then my lingering around camp average of 5 a.m. just about cooked I finally got into the beautiful town of Boiling Springs. It is really really picturesque. I was meeting Rickless Morty's mother at the ATCenter in town. I was to call when I arrived. I got in around 3 and called. Mad Mike from two days ago was there as well. He was very impressed that I had hiked it in. He had gotten a ride and was getting off the trail. It was too much for him. He wasn't enjoying it. It was time to go home. Chris picked me up around 3:30. We went back to the house. I washed my clothes. I gave the the tick treatment of promethium . I ate until I was too full to eat anymore. I got so tired after eating that I just went to sleep for the night. Hiker midnight came and got me.","Toms Run Shelter

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590614,"Tues Day 92 5/15 Start of 14th week. Zero in Boiling Springs at Rickless Morty's parent's house. Couldn't be a better 0 for the level of support provided. They gave me a key to a spare car that I could drive wherever and whenever. As well as a key to the front door. They both went to work and said we will be home after 6 p.m. sometime. I checked on the promethium for my pants and other camping gear. The sun was out so I moved it out of the garage onto the driveway. I had a half a bottle left so I literally just poured it on clothes to soak them wet with chemical. Had 5 eggs, spinach, and cheese for breakfast. I seemed a bit overwhelmed this morning. I don't know if that was from the heat of yesterday hiking in. I think I got a little fried last couple miles in full sun in the afternoon. Was having trouble really focusing and accomplishing things. My fallback is let's stretch. I always feel better after I stretch and a little more relaxed. My back felt like it needed to be cracked. It was very, very tight on my left shoulder blade. It was one pm before I realized it. I knew I had to get to the post office. I needed to mail back one of the two tents as well as some other things that I didn't need because Curtis was not going to be here. Had a good talk with my sister, Susan, who's been so supportive and Curtis adjusting now to a new job and new situations. Drove through Dillsburg PA. A nice old town that was thriving in the 30s. It had a big brick industry, an opera house, movie theater, and a train that came through town. Much smaller and quieter now. Some very nice old buildings that's for sure.
Got my alcohol wipes to try and address the sweaty legs dirty pants, and general hygiene on the trail in the heat. Got back in the afternoon ate a big spaghetti late lunch. Ate some ice cream and spent 2 hours trying to organize the next 8 days. You think how could it take that long to figure out where you're going to stop and where are you going to resupply. A lot of details go into walking around in the woods. It seems like a simple equation but it's very complex. Curtis had commented that he watched somebody put down his guidebook and say that's it I can't think about this anymore. I only can get the next couple days organized. I can't look at that guidebook anymore tonight. Now I think I have a good plan for the next 8 days. I probably will get into New Jersey in 12 days around the 28th or something.Â Around 7 Chris came home. We're able to chat for a while. Chris and Mike couldn't have been pleasanter, or more helpful and supportive. I got myself organized. I uploaded four days of blog and got ready to say goodnight. I checked out the the weather for the next 4 days. The high... it was going to rain for 4 days but the High was forecasted to be 68, 74, 67, and 76. I don't mind walking in the rain at those moderate temperatures. I won't have a meltdown. I won't have to leave at 4 in the morning to avoid the heat. I think that's a fine weather forecast. lt will make the trail a little slippery. There's balancing to everything. Sometimes I just have to look hard to find it.",,Nowhere,"May 15, Tue",0

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591212,"Wed. Day 93 5/16 Easy Day With the four days of projected rain, I was able to relax and sleep in a little. I got up at 4, stretched, made five eggs, yogurt, orange juice. Chris and Mike had given me the car so I could just drive over to the ATC Center and leave it there for them. When I was at the HTC Center looking for the the blazes a voice called out ""hey Lotus."" It was Georgia Peach. He hiked in to the center earlier and was sitting in one of the outside chairs inside his sleeping bag enjoying a Coke and a bag of chips. I didn't recognize him at first but he reminded me that we spent the night together in a shelter. He told me his name 'Georgia Peach."" It's always reassuring to meet somebody again that you already know on the trail. It's always a start after a zero-day to get back into the trail mentality. It was lightly raining. I just went with my trail t-shirt. Georgia Peach showed me the first Blaze. I had to hike along the road which is never fun. 5:40 on the trail again. For some reason as I started today I was a little emotional. Sometimes I don't understand it. I just roll with it until it passes. Today was a very easy day. It was lightly raining for the first three hours. I was walking on fairly smooth, muddy trails through fields. There were times I was walking through high grass or some kind of Farm grasses. They were laying over the trail to some degree. So as you walked by the grasses dumped huge amounts of water on you from your knees on down. My waterproof Merrell boots aren't waterproof at all. Even before I got into the high grass already my socks were wet. So now everything was wet, my pants were soaked. It was constantly like getting sprayed with a garden hose every step. After 3 hours it is cooled off. I could feel rain coming stronger. It started to rain hard and cold. I felt it coming and started to put on my rain jacket. It's always a embracing moment because your back is hot from your backpack and you're bending over and the cold, fat raindrops are splatting on your back. It's startling cold giving me a chill. It rained pretty hard right off the bat. The trail turned into a culvert. So now I'm walking through the grass in 2 in of water and everything is wet very, very wet. I had clean, dry socks for about 30 minutes today. The trail was gradual up and gradual down. A very, very easy day. About a mile from the shelter there was a sign that said sporadic spring at shelter, get water here. With all this rain and yesterday it rained incredibly. There were parts herwabouts that had hail the size of Ibex ping-pong balls. I decided to take a chance with so much rain that the sporadic spring would have water. When I got to the shelter there was one guy sleeping, Cody Coyote. He has been hikeing the trail on and off for the last 5 years. He is kind of a trail bum living on the fringe. No Shoes and Research had mentioned him. So I went and got water which was a bit of a small hike. The spring was being very sporadic. I had to excavate a little bit of the creek bed just be able to get my water collection bag low enough to get any water. I don't know when it runs but if all this rain doesn't make it run better than this they they shouldn't even bother calling it a spring. So I did 15 miles. I got in at 11:30. The easiest 15 I have every done. I met a girl named Ambassador, from London on my hike today. She was doing a flip flop out of Harpers Ferry. She was brand new and didn't have too much technique down. She was carrying 4 liters of liquids. She didn't have the best handle on her trekking poles technique. She was delightful. I stopped to talk about those topics. She showed up at the shelter about 45 minutes after me. She rested a bit and then wanted to push on to the next shelter which is only 7 miles away. I probably should have done the same cuz it was so easy today. When I was talking to my son, Luke, and my sister, Susan, they both stressed if I keep my miles under 20 and avoid high-heat, hike gentle I'll finish no problem. Sometimes I just want to get things done, acomplished, finish the project. So I just pulled up and took it easy and settled into the shelter. I didn't need to hike 22 miles first day after a zero. A Trail Angel came in with a six pack of beer, bananas, and apples. He is from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. We had a nice time chatting. He has a built a log cabin home just south of Tionesta, Pennsylvania. He was very pleasant. His wife had thru hiked in 2016. So I'm resting for the rest of the day. I'll get up and go tomorrow for an 18. 0. I got tired in the middle writing this so I took a nap for an hour. I woke up to very heavy rain on the shelter roof. It's not so bad hikeing on a gentler pace. :-).
Around 5, Hobbit and Echo came in. I was delighted to see them. Hobbit has a lot of quiet knowledge, that you only get by being near him. He really doesn't talk about it. Echo was her cheerful self. A Canadian couple came in and hike on. Ibex came in. I had met her at another shelter. The shelter I spent the night with Chimney No Excuses, Candyman and Good Push. We had a very pleasant social evening. This was echo's last night. She was hiking into Duncannon and flying back to Hawaii. Ibex showed me her hamock. She had big problems with her feet. She carries extra dty socks. She put a dry pair on every day. She also used the lot of Lueco tape.","Boiling Springs

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591214,"Thurs Day 94 5/17 Nancy... I was up and out by 5. It was a very gentle walk the 11 miles into the Duncannon. I pasted three retired sisters all under Pancho's. It looked like walking houses. I got into Duncannon by 9:30. I heard trains all morning. Later I realize I heard trains all day long going through Duncannon. It's like a railroad Symphony constantly playing. I happen to find it nice. I went into the only place open serving breakfast. I recognized 5 of the hikers who were in there. HoneyMoon and Traveler Ginger and his hiking buddy. They were maybe 11 hikers there. I got a double order of vegi omelette and home fries. I can't say the food was delicious. While I was working with my gear outside this woman, Nancy, who owns the store next to the breakfast place offered to give me a ride to the grocery store which was about a mile uphill with no shoulder. She didn't open till 11. She does Nancy's pretzels. So I finished up my food and ran to the store with Nancy. She was delightful. She lived in Duncannon for 30 years and was quite the chatterbox about the history. She also talked about a rude hiker, the first one she ever met, Hard Knocks. Nancy said she told him to get out of her store. When I left her store I quietly left a $10 on the table. She never asked for money. I was happy to leave a $10 for the trouble it saved me. She came out and gave it back. She said she doesn't do nice for money. She was really sweet. I was back on the trail at 11. I got to the shelter by 1 pm. Instead of staying there, I hiked another 11 miles. When I had come into town, Chimney and the crew were upstairs on the balconey accross the street at the hotel. They gave me a big shout out. It felt good very welcoming. It's more comfortable when you know people on the trail, rather than just crossing paths with strangers. I knew Chimney and the crowd were probably heading to that further shelter so I figured I'd catch them there. It was a steep climb out of Duncannon. First I crossed the Juanita Big River which then flowed right into the Susquehanna. It was quite a lot of bridge walking and a lot of water moving by. I love rivers. It was a delight. I walk by a sign in town. It said in1936 the water was over my head on the Main Street. I think that was the Johnstown Flood. I was making my way up a steep climb out of Duncannon. I was not carrying any water. Halfway up the sun started the try to come out. It was suddenly very hot and muggy. I started to heat up quite intensely. I am NOT good at hiking in the heat. I'm going to have to be careful about that. Like a wet towel on a baby's back, suddenly the cloud ceiling dropped, it was foggy and cold. Cool breeze was more swirlling by like it might even rain. I felt much better. I heard that it was a very steep downhill of 300 granite steps to get water at the next shelter. So 6 miles ahead, of my final destination shelter, I stopped, drank a liter of water and carried a liter and 1/2 in with me the last 6 miles. The last 3 miles got to be a bit of a tired push. I passed a couple at the three mile mark. They said the shelter was overloaded with people. They were going to town. I thought it might be busy but not overloaded. I thought Chimney and five of his friends would be there. I was correct. There were also three women hiking together, and a couple of other people. I got my spot right away. The last spot on the second tier sleeping area. This was a big shelter that slept 16 + people. Chimmy & the gang had gone down to get water. When they came up they had a lot to say. Good Push said it was the hardest uphill he done since Georgia. Another said he could feel his heart beating in his temples and thought he was going to pass out. They all thought I was pretty smart to bring my own water in. I got up from the table. I went up to the second tier and started laying down. The boys were staying up a little later then usual tonight chatting it up pretty loud. They were talking about that top five things important in life their lives. Freedom, alcohol, pot, seems to be in the top of the list. Not one of them mentioned finding a significant other and having a relationship with someone to cherish and hold, protect and share a life with. I had some thoughts but I kept them to myself. Ibex came in. She made the 22 miles from the last shelter as well. Logs came in. He started April first. He's doing 30 miles a day and figures be done in 90 days or less. As Chimney and the crew came up to go to sleep, Good Push asked me if I be getting up and out at 5. I said yes. He said good, he wanted to be up. They were going to do a Dirty 30.
During the night there was this constant knawing sound. Like somebody was chewing on wood boards. Everybody was awake. I don't know what time it was. Somebody said what is that? Logs got up and chase whatever was away. It was too cold to lay on your silky or be in it. It was too warm to be under your sleeping bag. I did not sleep well.","Darlington shelter

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590676,"Fri Day 95 5/18 When I went to the privy, I didn't take my trekking poles. I never do. I will now. There was at same annoying sound. I was surprised to see a porcupine trying to chew a hole into the privy. The porcupine showed no fear of me whatsoever. I came right up to him and took a picture. He just barely stopped long enough to look at me when I snapped the picture. He was right next to the door. So I took a chance pulled open the door and jumped inside. Porcupines don't move all that fast. When I came out he was gone.
When you pull the plug on your flash pads it always makes it loud woosh sound. As soon as I pulled mine, I heard Logs pull his. We both left at the same time. I got his photo. I won't see him again. My boots and socks have been wet since I left Boiling Springs. My boots are like someone poured water into them. In an hour I was catching a blister on my right heal so I stopped and put Lueco tape on. I also ate two bars. I really got in a rhythm. I had figured I'd get in at 4 p.m. So when I hit some nice gradual long inclines that I could really move well on I picked up my pace. When you can move well you feel mostly better like your you got this hiking under control. This is the first time really since I hurt my knee that I felt able to move this smoothly and constantly. After a couple hours around 11, IÂ  got tired so I stopped for lunch. My feet felt irritated so I took off one of my boots and and looked at my foot. It was a red mess. So I put a bunch of Lueco tape on that foot. My left felt okay just mildly irritated. The last 2 hours to the shelter felt like eternity. There was a lot of water on the trail. My wet boots felt 2 or 3 times as heavy as normal. Everything slowed way down. It became quite a challenge just to hike at all. Both feet were screaming about the irritation. My left one that I didn't tape was screaming much more than my right one. I finally got in about 2:30. It's a beautiful shelter with water right in front. I immediately put my feet up and took a nap for half an hour. I felt better after eating. It was so strange to go from feelings so good like you're having fun really hiking smoothly to the contradiction of your dragging yourself into camp, your exhausted, and your feet are screaming. I took off my boots. My feet look horrible. 94 days and I've had almost no blister problems. Now both feet are disasters. I am going to tape them up a lot more. I hope that covers it. I'm going to sleep in and tape them in the morning light. I'll give the tape a chance to set and then head out. I will wear my backup pair of dry socks. I may buy more socks in town. I'm going to hitchhike to town and eat dinner tomorrow. So I'll be hiking with the lightest pack that I can. I'll have a little water and no food. There's not much water available on the trail tomorrow. It is supposed to pour rain tonight, more water on the trail, more wet feet.","Peters mt

I went to bed feeling so miserable yesterday that I did not set my internal alarm clock. I woke up and it was raining outside the shelter. Cody Coyote had come in and was sleeping in the shelter as well. I woke up around 6:30 and didn't even want to get up. My feet were screaming at me. After a while I mobilized and spent 45 minutes individually Leuko taping the top of each toe on both feet. There was one sore spot on the bottom of my right foot index toe. I ate the rest of the food that was in my food bag. Ibex who had come in yesterday came down to get her food bag. It was already 8:30 or so. I asked her if she'd like to hike together today. We've been in the same shelter for 5 nights in a row. I would always leave early and she would always arrive late. I didn't know what kind of pace she hiked at but we did seem to end up in the same place. She still had to pack up. We thought we'd give it a try. We actually got on the trail around 9:15. It was supposed to rain hard until at least noon. It surely did. It rained all morning. The day seemed to go by a way easier with somebody to talk to. The streams were up all over. We came to one bridge that was actually partial bridge and partially a tree that was positioned to get across a creek. The water was very high and was actually above the lowest part of this bridge so you had to put your feet in the water to get across this bridge. Tested with my trekking poles for the bottom. There was no bottom to be touched. The stream was very high and raging. Ibex unbuckled her backpack as to stream crossing safety. Probably a very good move. We both successfully got over the bridge. The bridge in this case was a fallen down tree. So we were walking on a wet fallen down tree to get over this Creek. We then went under an underpass and the Raging Creek was within 3 in of flooding the concrete walkway under the road. Needless to say there was a lot of water on the trail. It was a very wet morning.
We found out that they had closed the trail at Harpers Ferry. The Potomac has flooded and the foot bridges are at risk of being swept away. We took two breaks but we're making steady time. We arrived at the 501 Shelter at around 5. This was a very nice shelter. You had bunks for 12. It had doors that closed. You could charge your phone at the caretaker's house. There was running water as well from the caretaker's house. We got ourself situated and actually were able to order food to be delivered. We ended up ordering too much food. One of the requirements of the shelter, even though it was so close to the road in town, was you had to carry out your trash. So we put the leftover food that we weren't eating and the trash in a trash bag and paid the delivery guy $5 to come back and pick up the trash cuz we didn't want to carry a lot of heavy food and trash that we weren't eating. The roof in this shelter was corrugated tin, and big 15 foot hexagonal plastic Center window. All this roof space amplified the sound of the raindrops hitting so it always sounded like it was storming tremendously outside. I really felt the whole lot better hiking with someone. The day pasted much more pleasantly. I taped up my feet again with the Leuko tape. When your feet are wet all day it's just pretty demanding to expect the tape to stay perfectly in place. My boots are pretty disgusting. They have been wet since Boiling Springs. My boots just hold the water in. When we went to sleep we were alone in the shelter. Later someone came in while I was sleeping. I didn't even hear them come in or figure out who they were.","

Up at 4 stretching and getting ready. I got Ibex to take a chance and start hiking at 5 a.m. She usually leaves at 7:30 or 8. It was much warmer today. It continues to lightly rain as we hike by headlamp. The trail was a running stream of cold water. It was water all over the place. We tried taking the side of the trail or there were some little hiker made side trails to avoid the water. Eventually we gave up and just started walking into the water. There was sections of the trail that were shin deep. All the other hikers that we met on the trail expressed the same frustration with water, water everywhere. We were on a 7 mile stretch that in our guide book said had no water available. We crossed a dozen springs and streams flowing full volume. HoneyMoon Traveler and Candyman all pasted us on one of our breaks. I was surprised to see them cuz they all do such big miles. It's seems like they're always doing a 30 mi day. HoneyMoon and Traveler hike10 miles in 3 hours. We later pass all of them on one of their breaks. We are hiking 24 mi today to Port Clinton. That will enable us it go to the largest Cabela's in the world. We both wanted to buy shoes cuz we knew they have a super selection. We ended up getting almost passed before Clinton by all the speed demons. The last section of hike down in Port Clinton was incredibly big downhill steps. A very long, very tough down hill. I'm sure if you had to take it out uphill it would be a major challenge. We got into Port Clinton hotel a vintage building for sure. We got settled in to a great dinner. We then went down to the pavilion. The pavilion is a open, covered, large building. Hikers can stay there for free. Joe Cool & Ginger were there. Joe Cool recognized and called out to me as we walked up in the dark. Joe Cool is having a serious problem with his IT band and has to get off the Trail for at least 5 days. Joe Cool is going to get x-rays and see if the IT problem is more serious. He thinks he heard a big pop. I've been talking to him for the last couple days as he complained about his IT. They love to do the huge days and then take a few days off. Turtle was there as well. Turtles is quite the environmental guy. He has a hematoma on his ankle from his boots. He says you can push it around under his skin. When he hikes it gets larger and larger all day until it's like the size of a quarter and it's blue.

So we're up and we get a shuttle down to the emergent care. We are the first ones there before they even open. We r both seen pretty quickly. The doctor prescribes antibiotics for myself. He recommends keeping my feet dry and walking in my Crocs for ventilation purposes. Like there's any chance of me walking in Crocs across the rocks in Pennsylvania. I didn't say anything specific to the doctor about how foolish and dangerous just walking across Pennsylvania Rocks could be. From there we walked to the Walmart and resupply. We ate a big breakfast at Walmart. We then walked to Cabela's Flagship signature store. It's a very impressive store with a lot of stuffed Wildlife. Cabela's is 4 hunters, fisherman, and car campers not thur hikers. There is a very limited selection of hiking boots. I go for a new pair of cut down Merrill's low tops of the same size that I'm wearing. Ibex found some trail Runners which are big change for her. We both abandon our smelly shoes, socks, and Superfeet that we were wearing before. We just left them on the floor and walked out. Neither of us want to transfer whatever germs - fungus growth opportunities in r old to r new Footwear. At this point I'm pretty concerned about foot fungus getting out of control and taking me off my hike. I have open sores on both feet on the bottom side of where my toe joints meet the ball of my foot. It's very painful to walk on every step. We then hike out to the road on a hot sunny day. The very first car immediately pulled over and drives us directly to the trailhead. Both of us are pretty anxious about our new Footwear. We're anxious cuz we're not sure how our feet are going to respond. We are also anxious cuz we're not sure how our footing may change with new Footwear. We have a solid climb up out of Port Clinton on a hot day. I've been hearing about Pennsylvania rocks for quite a while. There was a warning in the AWOL guide a couple days ago about the sharp Rocky Trail in Pennsylvania. We have had sections of the trail that are uncomfortably difficult to walk on. The problem is it's the edge of sharp rocks that does not allow your body weight to be equally distributed on the all of your foot. So one very small section of ur foot takes all the weight. There's a cumulative effect that is very painful. We didn't start hiking until 12:30. That's a ridiculously late start for us. Our goal is the Eckville shelter. We hike well and make good time. The shelter is 18 miles away. When we come to the road crossing it is time to look for this shelter which is on a paved Road. This is the first time I've walked on a paved road to get to a shelter. We found the Eckville shelter 3 tenths of a mile down the road. At first we thought it was the house. There was a house in front of the shelter. The shelter had a door that closed and glass windows. Close the door and windows are very unusual for a shelter. First time I seen a shelter w glass windows. Carpet was nailed down in the sleeping spaces for a little comfort. Turtle and one other fella were already there. We were coming in about 8:30, almost dark. They were already in bed. They got up with our late arrival to hang out and talk. We did a quick set up. We washed our feet with alcohol and went out to the picnic table to eat out there. Turtle said he'd be happy to leave at 5 with us tomorrow. We get to sleep long after hiker midnight.

We r up at 4 getting ready. The woman of the couple doesn't even try to sleep as we pack. She's checking her phone. It is actually better. That way we can be noiser but quicker. After 3 hours the sun comes out. Ibex and I are going into Palmerton to resupply. Turtle is going to hike to a sunny open spot and spread his stuff out to dry and take a nap.
Ibex has no experience hitch hikeing. It takes 20 mintues to catch a ride. The good news is that he takes us all the way into Palmerton off the highway right to the grocery store. The people in the store are wonderfully nice. I go across the street to the Dunkin Donuts and get two egg sandwiches. While were sitting in front of this grocery store a fella pulls up and parks right in front of us. We strike up a conversation. He offered to give us a ride back to the trail. He says he has to shop first. We tell him we'll be sitting right here in front of his truck. He's a wonderful fella and he drops this right back to the trail. Total time off trail 1 hour 45 minutes. Well after Palmerton the rocks get really serious. It's a very difficult hand-over-hand climb out of Palmerton and the rocks are just out right sharp and ugly. It's sharp ugly rocks, it turns out, from here all the way to High Point New Jersey. On the way we come across pile of black snakes. Turns out it's two snakes both of them about 7 feet long. One actually breaks out and does a little 10 foot cruise around the other one and then comes back. It was a nice diversion. When we finally get to the shelter our feet are about chopped up. Moon, Traveler and Candyman are taking a break. They're discussing hiking into Wind Gap to spend the night in a hotel. Everybody is run over. Honey actually comes in after us. Her comment is ""I thought I like hiking. I don't think I'll ever do it again. This is about the most difficult stretch I've ever done"" Ultra woman stops in and offers a battery charge for anybody's phone. She's taking a couple zeroe days. She's only got a mile to go and would be happy to share the extra juice in her anchor. Everyone leaves. Turtle comes in and I start to tell him about the snakes. He has a totally different experience of a snake. He came up on a rattlesnake in the trail. It was coiled and rattling. He wasn't focused and suddenly there he was. He said he just jumped sideways clear off the trail into whatever there was. They say you should look before you leap but sometimes you just don't have time to look. He sent us quite the photo of a rattlesnake ready to strike. Rattlesnakes don't give up the trail, they own the trail. You either respect them or pay the price. There's been numerous reports of rattlesnakes from other hikers. The turtle spends the night but we don't c him in the morning.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593005,"Thurs Day 101 5/24 sore tired feet
Our feet were so sore that we r only going to hike 13 miles today. It was more of the same, rough sharp rocks. We got into the shelter fairly early. I decided to start using my tent. I wanted to get a better night's sleep. The shelters r now cluttered with day hikers, section hikers, and new flip-floppers. At 3 in the afternoon the shelter was empty. So we ate and just had a slow afternoon. There was a spicket coming off of a private retreat so getting water was pretty easy. I set up my tent for the first time. As it turned out as the evening wore on a lot more people came into the shelter. I went to sleep around hiker midnight, 7 pm my time. I was aware of more people coming in, setting up tents and lots of talk down there at the shelter. I would have gotten much less sleep. I am over staying in shelters. I just became noise sensitive. Or maybe I'm just getting so tired I desperately need all my sleep. It was a very nice to sleep all night, perfect for sleeping. I didn't even put my rain fly on.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593039,"Fri 102 5/25 NJ We woke up seven and a half miles from the Delaware Water Gap. I'm pretty excited to be getting this close to New Jersey. The Village Farmer is what appears to be the closest you can get to a grocery store or food store in the town of Delaware Water Gap, opens at 8 a.m. We leave at 5:30. We're going to get there by 8 a.m. when they open. All goes well and we descend into the town of Delaware Water Gap. It's very nice attractive town with lots of old architecture. We get to the Village Farmer 10 after 8. The line is out the door. Turns out there's a total of 17 through hikers that decided to have breakfast at 8 a.m. to start their day. There's also some locals who come early as well,so it's like a through hiker party. Everybody is ordering lots of food. When ended up being there almost an hour, cuz we were last to order almost. That was okay cuz we were then going around to the Outfitters around the corner that opened up at 9. We got to the Outfitters at 9:30 and they literally had just opened up a half an hour late so we didn't miss anything. We then hiked across the Delaware River on Route 80. It's quite a big bridge. It's exciting to be hiking into New Jersey after all this time. There is a little more bounce in my step. It's a very busy parking area on the Jersey side. It feels good to start getting up the trail. There seems to be lots of scout groups, small groups, and groups of all kinds hiking the Appalachian Trail today at the Delaware Water Gap. We finally break away from that crowd and start to gain some distance and altitude. The sharp rocks continue. We take a break along Sunfish pond. We see 15/20 snakes sunning in a pile on the rocks by Sunfish pond. A woman is going swimming at that very rock. She comments that they r friendly snakes. She always swims here. That is her rock. More power to her. I'm not swimming w the snakes. We climbed up and walked along a beautiful ridgeline. After almost no views at all in PA, the constant view points on this exposed ridge line were spactular. I had heard people down south say NJ was their 2nd favorite state. Now I see why. It was also the very first section of the trail completed from Bear Mt., NY to Delaware Water Gap, NJ in1923. That was 10 yrs before the trail was completed. It lifted my spirits to see such beauty again. This is why I am hiking. The rocks were still sharp but this is very nice. I am very happy to be in NJ. We are getting water towards the end of the day. We meet Moose who started 4/1/18. He averages 27 miles a day. Moose took 1 zero day. His comment ""my feet have been meat tenderized, just pulverized. It is tough to just keep hiking"" We hike for about 30 minutes w him. When we come to a fire tower that Ibex wants to climb he continues. I just lay on tbe ground and talk to Sugarfoot who is camping there. Sugarfoot says the sharp rocks die away after High Point NJ. I am tuckered out. No firetower climbs for me.","

We were still fighting two sections of sharp rocks that just tenderize and pulverize the bottoms of your feet. There's really just no place to put your foot down on any flat solid surface. So your whole body weight gets focused on some very small amount of foot surface. Because the surface is so small the pounds per square inch proportionately increase and it bruises the bottom of your foot. I know of people who have had to leave the trail because of stress fractures in the foot walking over this section of Trail. This section I mean from Palmerton Pennsylvania through the end of High Point Monument New Jersey. It's not quite as bad as yesterday when we entered New Jersey. We are getting some stretches that are gentler on our feet. But again that's a point of perspective what is gentler on your feet. But we're making good time the weather is actually sunny and warm. We get to Culver's Gap where it crosses 206. We heard that gifts bike or bar is a good place to stop from Sugarfoot. He was at 78 year old fella who had served as the treasurer for the ATC. I think he had 30 years of volunteer service with the ATC. So it's very sunny and hot by the time we get some chips around noon. We hike along Route 206 to get the Jim. There's one woman who takes the orders runs the bar runs the kitchen and does everything in sight. Contrary to the report for a vegetarian this food is mediocre to poor. However the ambiance is phenomenal. We are sitting outside under canopy with a cool breeze blowing on a hot day on the edge of a lake. I get my phone plugged in charging order some sweet potatoes fries and a salad. The socks I'm wearing I realized have some kind of hard something has colaiste as a hard pad on the bottom of my sock on each foot. Probably some of my body fluids coming out of my seat. So I go in the bathroom take my Bronner's and wash my socks right up in the sink. I take him outside and Lamb on the hot asphalt and go back Under The Canopy. This is a pretty loose biker bar. As long as you're not breaking up the place they're not too concerned with what you do. I will say it was phenomenally nice. There were gazebos trees to sit under this nice canopy that I'm sitting under it was a very nice outside. Both our backs and I fall asleep at our table in our chairs. Baby bird is there why Matt back at Delaware Water Gap at the farm bakery. He's with another through hiker I don't know. After we've been there for like 2 or 3 hours we decide it's time to move on. Somebody says there's ice cream a quarter of a mile away. We start to walk but I get a sense it's not I backed checks her phone it's a mile and a half. No way. As we get back on the chair old baby bird is getting on as well. So we tell him he can't ass. He declines he's a flip Flopper. This is his first attempt at a 20-mile day. We have a pretty solid climb up off of 206 in to the mountain. For some reason my rhythm is right and we blast right up the mountain. Baby bird fell off the back but catches up to us when we're getting water. It's so hot that I'm taking my Blue Rag my only cotton item and drenching my head and shirt and back with Cold Stream water. I try and keep my body temperature down. If you're super hot when you get to Camp there's nothing to cool you off if there's no water source at the camp. You just stay hot all night. Not a good plan if you're looking for a good night sleep. We get to the top of Sunrise Mountain where there's a very large to pavillon. You're not allowed to Camp there. There's about 30 Boy Scouts who are setting up camp in the Pavilion. I wouldn't want to be around all that noise anyway hiker midnight is 7 p.m. they won't be sleeping till long into the dark. We hiked on for quite a bit until we find a stealth spot. We're set up by the time baby bird goes by. He likes our spot and we wish him well as he heads out to complete his first 20 mile day. It said his Achilles was bothering him and I cautioned him to go easy and rest it. Rarely does anybody listen.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593045,"Sun Day 104 5/27 goal resupply Unionville NY
We had stealth cams someplace passed some Sunrise Mountain Pavilion. It was a nice sight and I had slept very well. I'm taking this stealth camping cuz it's so quiet. When you pack up in the morning there's nobody to disturb. And there is nobody to disturb you while you're sleeping. That's the best part. It also does feel a whole lot more like your camping and making your way on your own. Not as much socialization. At this point in the trail there's a lot more flip-floppers starting out at Harpers Ferry heading north. The weather is better so we're getting more section hiker as well. I really like talking to through hiker Who Gon a thousand miles. They understand and relate to what you have to say. You can dip relearn from A Thousand Miles through hiker. So now I'm okay to be stealth camping and sleeping better. We're doing longer miles and I definitely need my sleep. New York has its own challenges. You're walking on Long slabs Rock. You're climbing hand-over-hand. And their times you're doing the rock scramble and it's very easy to get off the trail. When you're Rock scrambling you cannot take your feet size off your feet. One misstep and you crash on lots of Grey Jagged granite. There's no soft Landing only bruises or broken bones. One girl had raccoon eyes when she slipped and face-planted in the granite. Joe Cool slept and is off the trail for a bit rehabbing. Spice lips and sliced up Ernie. Many people I've gals legs call Hann or sliced arms. From Pennsylvania this year has been very challenging. Hard sharp sharp Jagged rocks the only thing to walk on and you definitely don't want to fall on. The sharp rocks of eastern Pennsylvania we're now fading away as we got further into New Jersey. But the hand-over-hand climbing up and downs was significantly challenging. We were heading for High Point Park which was the symbolic end of the kitten eating Ridge and the end of the sharp rocks. It was cool to see the high point Monument off in the distance. We had passed a shelter early in the morning and a Southbound hiker and said you could get a shower and eat at the High Point Recreation Area. Ibex was pretty excited and motivated to get to that shower. I was ready to eat. I was down to one bar as we were headed for a resupply at Unionville New York. As we got closer to the high point Monument there was a observation tower fight on the trail. We stopped and made the climb and all you could see was mountains in every direction. I'm proud to say more New Jersey is a very pretty part of the trail. I had met people in North Carolina who told me New Jersey was their second favorite part of the trail. After all that Ridge light hiking the last couple days I could see why. Everybody enjoyed hiking the New Jersey Ridgeline. We didn't realize that you had to take a 3 tenths of a mile side Trail to get this concession stand and the high point Monument itself. We were going down down down and we realized we missed the monument and concession stand. Ibex was a bit bummed. The general rule is you never backtrack. 2200 miles you don't backtrack you only move forward. As we hiked on we passed the secret shelter which is a house that a through hiker owns that you can stop at camp at but it's not listed anywhere it's Word of Mouth. We got to use the road to go into Unionville. It's illegal to hitchhike in the state of New York. So we walk the three quarters of a mile into Unionville. Our first stop was a little Pizzeria. They didn't speak much English but they made great food. I had a caramel ice cream bar while I was waiting for a big slice of pizza. The pizza was fabulous. I ordered a salad and noodles and vodka sauce. That came with garlic bread of course. I had a couple lemonade as well. We then went to the little convenience store in town. It was unbelievably cold in this store. We did our resupply and back went back to the pizza store where we had our phone's charging. Why we're walking back out to the trail I fell asleep so down and asked us if we wanted a ride. So we graciously accepted a ride back out to the trail. It was only another 5 miles to the Pochuck Mountain shelter which was the maybe next water spot. There was confusion about where to get water at this shelter so we didn't take any chances and carried a liter and a half. We ended up with a 25 mile day getting in just before dark. I never actually saw the physical shelter as we set up on the campsites on the way in to the shelter. Our feet were very wet. We have walked around the Wallkill Preserve. The trail has let us on a grassy access road around The Preserve. Because of the rain when you walk through grass your boots start to slash. A scary scenario for people who are struggling with foot infections and disease. It would rain that night so when we would pack up we would be packing up wet tents and hammocks. Wet things add weight to your pack. Ounces feel like pounds. Who knew I could be so sensitive.","

Camps near the Pochuck shelter last nt. On the trail by 5 am. There r lots of opportunities to get water throughout the day so we were carrying no water at all. This area has a lot of big rocks that are part of the trail. So throughout the day there are times when we are not able to use are trekking poles at all but rather hand over hand climbing and scrambling up and down over rocks. There are times when you put your trekking poles up above you on the rocks and climb up after them. When we made our original plan for the week we were going to Wawayanda shelter at Miles 1361.9. It would have been a 17 Mile day. Because we added mileage yesterday we had a new goal of camping at at Cascade Brook Mile1369 which had water as well. As we Heights throughout the day sometimes Crossing into New Jersey we decided we push further another 3 miles or 4 to go to the creamery it was up near Greenwood Lake. We figured we could buy dinner have some ice cream and that would be great. The creamery ended up being 24 MI so instead of a 17 we did a 24. When we arrive we were surprised to see the line out the door. This Creamery was connected to two families that have owned the farms and he's out in this Valley since before the Revolution. It was a beautiful view site they built this Creamery at looking out over the Valley. They only served ice cream so we got a quart of ice cream and a large milkshake. Ibex tranq the milkshake. We split the quart of ice cream. So really we only had ice cream for dinner . That might be every teenagers fantasy but it's not a complete dinner for a through hiker. We were tired by now and hoped to find a stealth camping spot soon on the trail. We weren't quite out of earshot of the road although It had quieted down quite a bit. We came across an ideal spot and set up r camp. Ibex set up her hammock. I set up my tent. After I had my tent up, I realized I had set it up under of Widowmaker. Even though I was tired not wanting to be foolish, I pulled up my steaks and move my tent to another location. As usual we washed our feet in alcohol and crashed out as soon as we could. We're both running pretty tired. we carved out an easier day tomorrow to meet up with Curtis. We're only 12 miles away and we should be able to put that away rather handily.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593049,"Tues Day 106 5/29 Tough
Today Curtis was going to meet us at 12 noon at Route 17 outside of Harriman New York. Curtis was going to bring us some supplies and be able to drive us to complete a resupply, laundry, and eating in a restaurant. We were up on the move at 5 everything was going well. We were actually a little ahead of schedule. Because we had been talking on Miles the last couple days we had wiggled this 20 mile day down to 12 miles. We figured it would be an easy 12. Are food bags were almost empty and we weren't carrying a lot of water. The last couple days New York have been particularly challenging. The guidebook had said despite the flat profile expect abrupt up and downs. Well the guide book was not blowing smoke. New York has been particularly challenging with the hand-over-hand climbing that we've had to do the last couple days. But we were feeling good and everything was heading for a easy day 12 mile car assistance resupply. We had been hearing about a section of the trail called the agony grind. Not exactly sure what that meant but it didn't sound good. The day became hot very fast. we were in the section called the agony grind. Somehow we didn't have enough food or water. My knee started talkin to me. We'd only had ice cream for dinner the night before no real protein. Suddenly my tank was empty and I was struggling pretty hard. Around mile 8 of our easy Twelve Mile day I said we're stopping at the orange Turnpike at Mile 10. Ibex was pretty tired as well and was happy to agree. We really had to drag ourselves that last two miles to the orange Turnpike. We put down the Tyvek, covered ourselves with insect repellent and send a pin on Google Maps to Curtis so he could find us. It was 11:30. Curtis got a late start and then there was an overturned tractor-trailer on the route. To his credit Curtis followed the New York license plates off the highway. He was able to bypass the overturned truck. He arrived around 1:45. We checked into the Tuxedo Hotel. We went to the local Diner and ate a whole lot of food. We got our laundry started and headed for the Walmart. It was already 7 p.m. We got back to the Tuxedo Hotel. I went in to see the hotel manager to switch rooms cuz our shower actually had gray and black mold growing on it 2 inches thick on the shower floor. Rather than switch rooms he just gave us our money back. We went and found the James Motel 5 miles away. The room had brand new carpet, tile bathroom, a beautiful room, a much better choice. It was getting late and Curtis needed to head out. It was already after hiker midnight. We talked about our plans for the next day. We were planning to do 3 days of 22/23 miles to make it to Pauling New York where ibex can get the train to NYC. I felt hot, tired, and run over. I felt so overheated I felt so overheated that I took a cool shower to lower my body temperature. I think I need a 0 day not 20 more miles. Ibex is still pretty tired as well. We decided to zero the next day. During the night I thought maybe we could just do 7 miles, reduce the 67 miles to 60 to get the Pawling in 3 days of 20 miles each. Much more manageable. We talk it over in the morning. Things weren't quite going according to the calculated plan. You can plan all you want. Everybody imagines that they're capable of doing so much. Everybody would like to believe they are capable of doing what they imagine. The reality is This Is a Tough Long Haul. The cumlative effect is starting to catch up. 100 days of hiking, carrying a pack, filtering ur water, etc. Is pretty demanding on the human body.","

We got dropped off back at the orange Turnpike where we ended yesterday. It was about 10 a.m. We met a few sections hikers. Then we came across Ultra Runner who we had seen yesterday when we were done in waiting for Curtis. Ultra had said she was beat as well yesterday. This was a very tough section for all. We didn't feel so bad for wimping out. If Ultra thought it was tough and felt run over, it was a tough section. I haven't met many tougher than Ultra out here on the trail. She had been picked up at Rt 17, by a friend from Boston, driven an hour away to an REI, got new shoes and a complete resupply then an hour back. Here she was. She couldn't have gotten that much sleep eitger. She was carrying a 42lb pack. I couldn't imagine carrying such a pack. Athletic Superwoman. She considers it weight training. When she runs her 3- 200 mile races one in August, September and October she will only imagine how light she will feel. We spent the day hiking with Ultra Woman. She would lead on the downhill cuz even with 42lb she was faster than us. Then she would drop back on the up hills so she could take themm at her pace. She was a wealth of knowledge and an absolute delight to hike with. We were only planning to do 7 miles. We only wanted to get a little further ahead because we were just run down, beat up, ridden hard, and put away wet. It was a perfect day. The temperature was perfect, there was a nice breeze blowing. This section of hiking had a few exciting moments like the Lemon Squeezer, which was a narrow passage between two large rocks. There was an easier way sign. Ultra Woman took the easier way. You had to reach up as high as you could, grab a hand hold on some sharp Rock and pull yourself up. After I did it, I wondered how smart that was to put so much pressure on my knees as I was pulling myself up. This is an exciting kind of hiking, more of what I imagined the Appalachian Trail would be like. The forest was beautiful. This was Harriman State Forest. All the trees mature and the ground cover was grass. The grass is waving in the breeze. It felt like a vacation to be hiking only 7 miles. It was a perfect day like I said. It was so enjoyable to be just hiking 7 miles, in ideal conditions, in good company, at a slow pace. After six and a half miles we bid Ultra Woman goodbye and spread out the tyvac. We ate some food and both fell asleep in the speckled sun. After while No Excuse passed by and called out to me. Quite a picture of us sleeping alongside the trail. It took quite a while for the shuttle to pick us up. On the way back to the James Motel I saw a thru hiker at Route 17 trying to flag us down. The taxi driver didn't want to stop. I said stop !!! stop!!! I know that woman. She was begging for a ride to someplace else then where she was. She was a strong thru hiker who started at Springer Mountain. A male friend had come to join her for a section. He was a disaster, who could not hike at all. She wanted to get him some place where she could send him back to wherever he came from. It wasn't a matter of friendship, it was a matter of you have to hike at the same rhythm and the same patterns or anybody you're hiking with will ruin your hike. I had actually never met her in my life. But she was a thru hiker and you take care of any other thru hiker you come across. She was very grateful we stopped. Their phones weren't connecting and they were having a heck of a time. We took them back to the James Hotel. She was very greatful.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593051,"Thur. Day 108 5/31 we had plans to just hike 16 miles and Stealth camp today. Ibex realized if we hike four more miles and do a 20 we would be in Peekskill, New York. She could then take the train out of Peekskill into New York City meet her cousin and enjoy the city. We got back to the trail at 5:30 a.m. We continued the hike through the beautiful Harriman State Park. To my surprise Hot Sauce came by as we were taking a food break. He had no food whatsoever. He's hiking the trail on an absolute shoestring. So I gave him 4 bars, a bag of Trail Mix, two dinners, and a half a pound of pepper jack cheese. He atethe half a pound of pepper jack cheese before he finished his conversation with us. I haven't seen hot sauce in 6 weeks. It was a gentle day with some nice views and great places to take a break. We were hiking at our standard 2 mile an hour pace. Harriman State Park and Bear Mountain State Park go together. There's a observation tower at Bear Mountain State Park. We spent a half an hour reading and learning about the history of Bear Mountain State Park. We learned that after the death of her husband, Mary Harriman donated 10,000 acres and a million dollars in 1909 to create Bear Mountain State Park. Her husband was the leading expert on railroad construction and the family later on bridge construction. We hiked down a thousand feet to the lowest point on the trail. I never understood what they meant by the bear cage. As the trail wound through the zoo at Bear Mountain State Park we realized, oh they have bears here in the park at an elevation of 177 feet sea level the lowest point on the AT. We walked over the Bear Mountain Bridge. It started to rain during the two steep up hills before Peekskill. We finished our 20 miles at the Appalachian Deli on Route 9 in New York. Hot Sauce, 50, Good Push and Cheddar as well as a half a dozen other through hikers were already there. It was a good Deli. I had a lot to eat. We were organizing Uber to the Inn on the Hudson when Cheddar and 50 said they were going there as well. When the Urber came Good Push decided to jump in as well. There was only room for four but the Uber driver was cool. You can always squeeze in one more through hiker in any situation. We talked a lot about how the best part of this through hike was the people. Good Push said it had renewed his faith in mankind. Everybody commented on how everybody helps everybody. There are really no sides on a thru-hike. Everyone is on your side. You bond up into little families called Tramilies. We talked about how this bubble of 20 or 30 through hiker kept crossing over with each other. Some people hiking dirty thirties and forties. Ibex and I just hike 18 to 22 everyday. Somehow this bubble keeps crossing over each other even with such varying amounts of hiking per day. Cuz another variable is how many zeros you take. You take more than one zero in a row. It's really a community that's hard to replace or replicate back in traditional society. We are all heading the same way, facing the same challenges, difficulties, and obstacles. There's a cumulative effect of wearing down your body and your mind. So much of this is about your state of mind. That's where the tramilies come in. People who hike your pace, think like you, and encourage you to carry on in spite of the hardships. Hot Sauce is putting together a video on your hardest day. When I was talking about my feet, everybody was happy to look at my feet and compare it to the beating and challenges their feet had taken. This is a very difficult adventure. I didn't know what it was going to be like. I didn't expect it to be as difficult as it is. I've never thought of not completing it, but there have been some very tough tough days. As I talk to the others, they all say the same thing, this is a hard task in tough conditions. They were talking about the day of the lightning storm as they were crossing the fields. So they ran into the woods where big branches were being blown off the trees and crashing onto the trail. Then the hail was whipping in their faces. Just where exactly are you supposed to stand to be safe in these conditions. Oh and there was a strong, soaking, driving, pounding rain mixed into all that as well. Everybody was out there that day and everybody lived through it. There's something about shared adversity that pulls people together. When we arrive at the Inn their computers are down. They were down when we called earlier from the deli. We sit outside for 2 hours waiting to get a room. After I get in the room and shower I try and watch game 1 of the NBA finals but I am so tired I just fall asleep after the first quarter. At this point I am pretty beat up. It appears everybody is pretty used up that I'm talking to. Everyone had a story for Hot Sauce video on the difficult, painful, trying moments of hikeing the AT. It's not all days in the 60s Sunny with a 15 mile an hour wind. This is a tough, long, hard grind.","

For $6 I get an egg breakfast. So I described to the woman how I cook eggs at home. To my delight she brought me 8 eggs covered w swiss cheese and spinach. I had already eaten three yogurts, a heavily cream cheese bagel, two glasses of orange juice and some orange slices. Took me quite a while to finish my 8 eggs. I went back to the room and slept for an hour and a half. I awoke to a knock on the door. It was Good Push. They had decided to zero but the hotel was sold out. Of course the three of them could crash in my room. So now we have five in one room when Ibex gets back late tonight from NYC sharing the hotel room. They are planning to do a 30 or 40 tomorrow. I told them I was happy to them. Ibex and I will just be doing our 18 to 22. Somehow we always end up crossing paths with the same crowd. I worked bringing my blog up to date for 6 hours.

Slowly everybody else did as well. 5 people in one room everyone preparing almost in slience. The taxi didn't answer. We ended up waiting 30 minutes for an uber. We fit 5 people with packs in a Toyota Corolla. Back at the Appalachian Diner we all had a big feed before heading out. The other 3 all hiked w 2 lieters of water, more than 4 lbs of water. I carry no water. The guide indicate plenty of water sources today. We cross paths with Furnace and Griz flip floppers. We've seen them a couple times now. Everything is going well until I catch my foot on a 3ft long root across the trail. It's connected at both ends so it's like a tripwire. It causes me to stop dead in my tracks and really wrenches my knee. By the time we got to steren Fahnestock Lake I had to just stop and sit down. My knee was absolutely screaming at me. Of course it was my right knee the one that gave me the most problems before. Everything was going pretty well. My feet were healing from both rocks and infection, my teeth weren't bothering me anymore, and my knees were fine. We end up hiking 18 miles and stealth camping just before the rph shelter at a beautiful spot, which was our goal for the day. The crows make such a racket for about an hour. It is amazing. We are camped very close to the trail. Only two people go by for the rest of the day. Hopefully my leg will be better in the morning.","

We start out slowly and just let me work my knee into action. Sometimes the only solution to physical problems is he the rest or hiking slowly. We opted for the latter and just kept us slightly slower pace for tickly on the downhill. As the day wore on the uphills were fine. I just had to take baby steps on the downhills. There was plenty of water and we drank when we needed to. I had mail dropped a Box to the Dutchess Moter Lodge in Wingdale, NY. We hiked 18 mile in 11 hours instead of 9. We got to our exit road around 4. Unfortunely we hitch a ride to Pawling, the wrong town. We then buy train tickets to a train, that doesn't come. We call a taxi, but tell them wrong station. We seemed to be a bit overwhelmed. Then the Pawling taxi pulls up to where we r sitting in the sun cuz we were cold. The nice lady drives us to the motel. They are available to drive us back to the trail at 5 am in the morning. We check in, and get my mail drop. The clerk says food is 800 feet down the road.

I still have one open sore that is painful to walk on. I decide to take an unplanned zero. My knee hurts. I won't know how bad till I walk on it. I don't get up till 7. I go down to the deli to get a couple egg sandwhichs. It doesn't rain all day. I work on getting my blog up to date which i do. Then it stops uploadi g on trail journals. I have been way behind because it has been physically very tough hiking. Most day i am just beat physically. Mentally i am not much better.

Okay we were ready to go at 5 and had eggs sandwiches at Ben's Deli. Called for the taxi who said he'd be there in 20 minutes. He really meant an hour and 20 minutes. We hiked 22 miles. We entered into Connecticut for the first time. There was some extreme downhill. I thought Dragons Tooth up to now has been the most technical downhill hiking. Connecticut introduced us to some very serious downhill hiking. It seemed like straight down over the edge downhill hiking. After we finished that which took a long time cuz we really crawled slowly down that Mt. We ended up walking along a river which was probably on an old topath for barges and just sailed along for about 4 miles. With the trails like that, you can't predict how we're going to do today or how many miles we're going to do. Now we just set out with a generalized goal and stealth Camp someplace. Our goal was to get to this identify Campground that had a pavilion. It also had a well with a water pump w good water. When we got there there were three section hikers, a couple and a woman. After we set up Joe Cool and Ginger came in. The section hikers were already in their tents cuz it was probably eight. That's late for people on the trail. Joe Cool was his usual loud self. He actually said that he learned from me and they're not doing more than 20 miles a day. No more dirty thirtys. Joe Cool actually said he was taking a page out of my book and just trying to protect his knees and ankles by keeping his mileage under 20 a day. It was cool to see him. He was off trail icing for 5 days near the Delaware Water Gap. He'll go back and make up that mileage. So it was a nice cool night and I had a great night sleep. I slept snug like a bug in a rug.","9

Up and out at 5. Joe Cool and Ginger hadn't even stirred yet or anybody else. We tackled a steady uphill right off the bat. We saw a beautiful sunrise which I got a picture of through the trees. I was feeling not so spunky. That's another way of saying I was dragging. So we stopped for water and lunch around 11. Our food bags were starting to get lighter. I don't want to carry more than 2 days worth of food. It's just way too heavy. So we searched around in our guide book. There was the town of Falls Village up ahead. Being as tired as we felt we decided to enjoy lunch in town. There wasn't much open being it was Wednesday. We did find a little breakfast/lunch place near the high school. We just decided to enjoy lunch and not worry about how many miles we're going to get done today. So we took a 2-hour lunch. The food was off the hook. We ate quite a bit. We met Fainting Goat. She got her name by fainting on the PCT Pacific Crest Trail. She's finishing her Triple Crown. She started the AT, April 9th. She has an 8 pound base weight pack. She hikes 30 to 35 miles a day. These endurance athletes, they don't have any kind of particular bodies other than being average to slender. She was very pleasant though. I got her picture as well. On the way back to the trail there was Squeeze again walking by. She's so pleasant every time I see her. As we hiked out of town we hiked along the Hositonic River again. We came to a section with a wonderful waterfall, very picturesque. After we pass through some fields we heard an owl in the woods. I practiced my echo hooting with the owl. After about six Echo Hoots, we finally saw the Owl as it took flight and flew away from us. He probably didn't want to be hanging around with any owl that sounded like me. It was quite a sight to see an owl with their big wings flying off a tree. We have found some water and decided to stealth camp. This was not a developed camp that anybody else had camped at. We just found a level place for my tent and two trees for Ibex's hammock. Joe Cool and Ginger passed by as we were setting up camp. Always good to see a friend on the trail.

Out about 5:30. Heading into town for a quick resupply. When we got to the road, we didn't realize it was only three tenths of a mile to town. So we hitch hiked and it probably took as long to get a ride as it would have been to walk. We got the town 10 minutes before the grocery store opens. Not too bad timing. There was a civil war monument to the Union Soldiers from that area of Connecticut that died during the war. It was the first time Ibex had seen a northern monument. She had actually never seen a northern monument about the Civil War. This was a very nice New England town with lots of very big mature maple trees. We hiked out to the trail and headed north. We hiked up to the highest point in Connecticut. It had been established in 1885 as the highest point. As we continue hiking, we came to Mount Everett. Mount Everett is a steep climb. I could feel my achilles and the arch in my foot straining with the intense uphill. A number of places they had an 8 by 8 step that have been cut diagonally and bolted into the mountains to provide steps to climb. I would say this is a steepest climb we've had so far short of the iron rungs. This was a much longer, steeper climb. This climb really wore me out. I was exhausted by the time we finished. Even when I look at the guide book it's hard to assess how tough a climb or descent is. U can never tell the trail surface. As we were resting another thru-hiker named Princess came down the hill. She was trying to assess where she was. As soon as we got up to leave she jump into our group. Princess has quite a history. I thought she looked around 45. She mentioned she didn't start hiking camping until 58. She's hiked the PCT before. I had heard about her but not by name. I had heard someone had fallen and crushed their face and had two raccoon black eyes. Princess told us about falling in Pennsylvania breaking her finger and smashing her face on the granite. She showed us pictures with one eye swollen completely shut. She could just squint out of the other eye. She didn't go to the hospital. She just kept hiking. After awhile everything got better and she look great today.
That's the thru-hiker motto if you can walk just do it. She told the story of a girl on the PCT who fell crossing a stream and cracked her forehead on a rock. She ripped quite a gash across her forehead. Fortunately, somebody had butterfly bandages. This girl bandaged up her forehead and kept hiking. It wasn't like it was her knee or her ankle and she couldn't walk at all. It's a very peculiar breed of people that want to come out and walk 2000 miles without giving up. It's about completing the challenge and not giving in to the adversity. Princess was trying to catch up to Johnny Walker who we had met the day before. He's finishing his last hundred miles of his thru-hike. He's from Mississippi. He's an older fellow 69 years old. She didn't want to be hiking alone because she just had a bad experience with Hard Knocks. I had mentioned Hard Knocks before back at Black Rock Mountain. He had gotten drunk at a hostel, puked all over the place, and told people about beating a man to death and leaving him in an alley. The hostel owner had thrown him out. He was now out on the trail near us some place. She did not feel comfortable alone with Hard Knocks lurking around.
We actually caught up to Joe Cool and Ginger as they took a break near a lake. They immediately headed out as we passed them. We were looking for water and weren't finding any. We drink out of moving water. We passed a tree that had Trail magic for particular people thumbtacked to the tree it was quite cute. Somebody had gone to the trouble of coming to this section of the trail with some simple treats for someone they knew. Even if you don't get the trail Magic it's a boost to see that it's out there for somebody. It always feels good. Kind of a Little Help from My Friends. Two shelters a tenth of a mile apart. Very strange. We stopped to get some water the only water we had seen in quite a while. When we see water we get it. Adding 5 lb of water to one side of my pack was a huge imbalance that I could feel tremendously. We went maybe a hundred yards and we started to explore a possible stealth site. As we got into the site there was a little bit of a hill. We went over the hill and there was a perfect stealth site on the other side. Perfect in you may not be supposed to be stealth camping. So if you can stealth camp out of sight of the trail surely you're not going to have any problems.

We were very tired and decided we would sleep in and leave around 7:30. We are hiking to resupply. We were going to resupply in Great Barrington. So Great Barrington, Mass is seven and a half miles away. It wasa gentle smooth trail to hike. We actually arrive in under 4 hours at 10 after 11. We were standing in the road trying to figure out which way town was when we saw Squeeze waving and yelling to us. We went over and she introduced us to Joe, the free shuttle driver, in this wonderful town. Joe took us to town, waited for us to resupply, and drove us back to the trailhead in a total of 50 minutes. It doesn't get better than that. I don't know whether anybody can go into town and resupply faster then 50 minutes. In Palmerton, it was an hour and 45 minutes to hitch-hike In and Out and resupply. I thought that was very fast. We took a break and ate a huge lunch in the shade of a big Maple Tree near the trailhead. As we ate, Moon appeared walking through somebody's backyard. We called him over. He was trying to connect to Uber to get a ride to town. He had just hiked 17 miles in five and a half hours. Soon enough Princess, Luke, Johnnie Walker, Honey, Traveler and Candyman were sitting under the tree. We passed along the information about Joe, the free shuttle driver. Moon told the story of going to New York for 3 Days to see a Mets game and enjoy the city. Much to his surprise, when he's walking in Manhattan, Squeeze is calling out his name and is dressed in a very fine black dress going out to dinner with her boyfriend. 7 million people in NYC and Moon bumps into Squeeze. It's a small AT community and they're all over watching out for each other. We hiked on, first the trails was very nice. Then the trail gets increasingly Rough Rocky Roots, Reminiscent of Pennsylvania. Four or five hours of Rough Rocky Root hiking and my feet are getting super sensitive again. We come up on this beautiful 6 tenths of a mile wonderful ridgewalk overlooking the best Massachusetts has to offer. It can really take your breath away when you're hiking and constantly seeing a wonderful expanse of scenery. But the rough Rocky roots were taking a toll on our legs and our feet. We were trying to hike to water in a stealth spot in the distance. At one point we thought it was three more miles to go looking at our guide book and I only had 2 miles left in my legs. I said we may have to Camp without water and hike to water in the morning cuz my legs don't have 3 miles left. We check Guthooks on our phone and found out we were reading our paper guide wrong. It really was 2 miles to water. So we made it to water.and We tried to find a stealth spot by The Ledges. We found something that would pass as adequate. It wasn't level ground and it was very buggy. But that's thru-hiking. It's not always a soft bed that you end up being in at the end of the day. We set up camp and went to sleep almost immediately.","

Out at 5:40 very rocky start. The trail was a continuation of the Rocky Ruff Roots. After our resupply, it felt like we had very heavy food bags. I'm becoming quite the wimp about carrying anything more than 4 lb of food. Our goal was to eat all the food that we were carrying before we got to the next resupply which would be in Dalton Massachusetts. We had some confusion because there was two Wilcox shelters North and the South and the signage was not clear to us where we were. Even with the rough footings it felt like we were making good time. It was a 20 mile day ahead of us and we had to keep moving to be able to complete it in 10 or 11 hours. At the top of Baldy Mountain we met a thru hiker named Cowboy. He was experiencing the same sensitive feet that we were. We were reminiscence for a moment or two about Pennsylvania and how tough that was. We got to a nature area and was confused again. It appeared that we were hiking south to go north. That happens on tbe AT at times. We met a fellow promoting Mighty No Bitey bug repellent. He gave us a sample. In spite of the tough trail surface we were hiking well. We crossed Mass. Pike RT 90. It was a lot of noise. It was a big deal to me to cross Mass. Pike. We passed the Upper Goose Pond House sign that said OPEN. What does that mean? Whatever it was it was a half mile away. We hiked on. On Monday we learned u could have stayed there for free. They served all u could eat blueberry pancakes w maple surup every morning. I was late with the data retrevial. We didn't want to get water or sleep in the RT. 90 area. We were tired but hiked on. We finally found a water source and RT.90 was a distance whine that earplugs could mask. Our stealth camping spot was on mossy rocks with water running through and around us. It was very buggy. Once i got my tent up, I just had to lay inside and rest for an hour before doing anything. There is a cumulative effect of fatigue happening. All the hikers are talking about it. By hiker midnight, 7 pm, I was fast asleep. It was nice sleeping with the sound of running water all around me.","

Up and out at 5 a.m. . Because we were camping in a water source we had to hike 150 ft away from the water source to brush your teeth and take care of morning activities. This was for maintaining the integrity of the watershed. You don't want to use soap within a hundred feet of a water source. The trail was Rocky to start. It did not feel good on my feet. My hiking shoes end up feeling like thin leather moccasins. My feet have become so sensitive each irregularity of the trail surface makes its imprint on my sensitive feet. Usually that inpact results in a painful experience. I am grateful that the open sores that were on the bottom of my feet
are finally healing. It used to be tough on either foot. Each step was shooting pain where the toes meet the ball of my foot. When my feet were actively infected every step was a painful. Things are so much better now. Everyday I wash my feet with 91% isopropyl alcohol. I am more scared of wet feet and deer ticks that I am of bears. Every night after I wash my feet I cut away little slivers of dead skin. We were making good time even though I felt tired. The trail surface very from Ralph Rocky Roots to pretty clear nice hiking. It was a cool temperature and really a good day for himing. We stop at the water source pretty early. There was a Seven Mile Stretch of no water coming up. And like I said before, when we come across good water we just Camel up. Even though it seemed like a perfect day for hiking conditions my legs felt very heavy and I was just wearing down. We weren't planning to zero for another couple days. But with five miles to go, it was clear that I was all used up. There was no way I was hiking anywhere tomorrow. The arch in my left foot started talkin to me for the first time in a hundred twenty days. My knee was talkin to me as well. My knee wasn't screaming at me like it can but it was regularly talkin to me. It was different from when I wrenched it 5 days ago. That was a different pain and that seemed okay. This was an overuse discussion that my knee was having with me that I better pay attention to. My lower back was also talked to me in a very loud voice and it was getting very loud. About 3 miles in we met Squeeze again on the trail. Soon after Squeeze we met some section hikers who wanted to hike with us. This was fine cuz by this time we will pretty slow and we weren't getting out in front of anybody. We had a lot of lively discussion and for a mile we were distracted. The last two miles in to Dalton seem to last forever. Gumby passed us. He recognized me from Front Royal quite a while ago. We chatted briefly and he moved on. As we entered Dalton, Redbird his hiking partner caught up. He hiked right on into town w us He had no need to pass. Dalton is a very pretty town. Lots of old New England architecture with lots of big maple trees shading everything. We stopped at Sweet Peas and had ice cream and Sarsaparilla soda. It was hot now in the sun on the concrete. We hiked on and stopped at the convenience store and bought some Gatorade. Squeeze was walking past and we flagged her down and got her phone number. We've been crossing paths with her for the last month. She likes to solo hike. Checked into the hotel foun, a great place to eat, Java and Juice. Ate a lot of food and crashed. We were supposed to hike with Ibex's brother, Jess on Monday but that was out the window. I don't think I could walk to the store. I just hit a wall today and it was over.","

Sept in, got up at 7. Went to Java and Juice around the corner and ordered 3 breakfast burritos, a lemon poppy seed muffin, and a whole vegetable quiche. Gumby was there as well as Charlie Horse. Everyone is referencing the cumulative effect. Gumby hikes with Red Bird from Yardly, PA. I had met Gumby and Red Bird in Front Royal. He remembered me. I'd given Gumby and Redbird some extra laundry detergent I had. Gumby said they hiked 27 miles two days ago and felt great. Yesterday they both hit a wall, even though it was relatively smooth easy hiking, they were done, just tucker out. Charlie Horse said he had slipped on a greasy rock and ended up doing a split and hurt his knee. He said the second day sitting in the hospital it occurred to him. You could be an old man looking at his leg in a hospital or he could be back out on the trail making miles. Turns out he's back on the trail making miles. Everyone will go through adversity and challenges on the trail. Your hope is that whatever the injury adversity is, you can at least walk and hike. He says he hikes a little funny. He buddy hikes his trekking poles to potect his knee. Sometimes I'll protect my right knee by using both trekking poles when I'm putting pressure on that right leg. He calls it the crutches technique. I used that quite a bit when my knee gave out on me back before Shenandoah. I don't use it much anymore cuz my knee seems to be doing okay. I used it the other day when I wrenched my knee on that root. That was pretty painful and I surely use the crutches technique for the rest of the day then. I had the same thoughts when I had to just sit down later in the day because it hurts so bad. Is this a hike ending injury or this another challenge? You just want to work through the challenges and avoid the hike ending injuries. Came back and took a long nap after breakfast. Managed to pull another one lb 4 oz out of my backpack and mail it home. Postcard is staying here at the Shamrock Hotel as well. He was impressed with a pound and 4 oz. He said 6 months ago he wouldn't have impressed. Now each ounce matters and 20 oz is a big deal. So my base weight is now probably 15 and 1/2 lb. I can really feel when I put 2 liters of water in there cuz that's 5 lbs and a 33% increase in weight. Everyone here at this point of the hike is weight conscious to the max. It's too much of an effect on hiking everyday. It is very serious. I think there's a level of fatigue that I've reached that is impressive. I am at some level of core tiredness. I think this Alaska trip with Sue will be perfect. I will not be pressing my body athletically for 3 weeks. Hopefully it'll give me a chance to recover. I won't be at the almost done any second level of fatigue. I will also not be making very many decisions. My sister, Susan,has traveled to Alaska. Sue has put a lot of preparation into this Alaska trip. It's more of a family trip. I'm just going to be going with the flow, hanging with the family, and doing whatever the next thing there that we are supposed to be doing. I am not planning, organizing, starting, coordinating, or anything else about this trip. I'm going to just go with the flow. Ibex's Uncle Lee and his wife showed up with Jess, her brother. They went out on a variety of errands and activities. I worked on my blog and took another nap. Around 6:30 Jess and Ibex got back. We went out to dinner at Java and Juice. I'd had a mint shake in the afternoon so along with my dinner, I had a raspberry Shake. it was already after hiker midnight when we got back so we all crashed.","

As we were going on the trail hiking up to Mount Greylock, the tallest peak in Massachusetts, we came across Joe cool and Ginger who is actually Domatello. Somehow I got his name confused and I've been calling him Ginger. It's amazing how many times we crossed paths w them hiking to Maine. It was very cool hiking with Ibex brother, Jess. He's a personal trainer who knows a lot about how human body works. He is now studying for his Ph.D in moleculuar medicine. The climb up Mt. GreyLock was much to our liking. The top a Greylock is quite impressive. There's a Stone Tower that's a monument to World War I veterans who lost their lives. At the top of the tower you can see quite a ways Albany, New York,Mount Washington, NH, 360 degree views. It was a perfect day. We were on a good schedule so we are able to hang out have lunch on the Mountainside. It was one of those perfect temperature days. The wind was just right and I fell asleep in the Sun. Had a little curious interaction with a fellow with a drone. As we're sitting there enjoying our lunch there's a whining scream of a of a drone right above us for about 30 minutes. It surely didn't seem to fit in with the ambiance of the location. When he brought the Drone down I asked him if he was finished. He said he was. I didn't think anything else more of it. About 15 minutes later he came back and angrily asked if his flying his drone had bothered me. I said one word, yes. He commenced to be very angry and said that he had broken his finger as I was talking to him. Jess took offense to his tone and got up to confront the situation. This might escalate to violencein a blink. Turns out Jess can have a short fuse. I just turned away. It all seemed to pass and nothing happened. As we hiked down off of Graylock we came across a porcupine in the trail. They have no fear and really don't care what you do. We hiked to where Jess was going to get picked up by a shuttle which would take him back to the train station. We hiked in into Williamstown and had a very nice dinner. Wethen got a half a gallon ice cream at the food store. Hiking out of Williamstown was very pleasant as well. We made very good time on an uphill to our liking. After we got past the no camping restrictions because It was along the water supply for the town we stopped just by the Vermont border. We created a little stealth site for ourselves. Sometimes there will be a stealth site that has been used many times by other people. Other times you're tired, you've gone far enough, and you're just looking for a flat enough spot for a tent and two trees for hammock. We were tired.","

Turns out we were only a hundred yards from the Vermont border. Three cheers to get all the way to Vermont. We hiked passed Joe Kool and Dom's stealth camp. We came across a guy by the name of Osprey who was from Italy. He had been hiking the trail last year. He fell and got hurt so badly that he couldn't continue. So he was back again this year to try and finish his thru-hike. He was really quite a funny pleasant guy to come across. Neither one of us were feeling particularly well. After 15 miles we were hiking down into Bennington. It was a pretty steep descent. It had a lot of steep big steps of granite. There was a slight drizzle so everything was getting wet. It add a degree of anxiety when you're taking big steps down hill on wet Granite, wet roots, wet slippery everything. As Charlie Horse would say, it makes for greasy rocks. I wasn't feeling particularly spunky. When we got to the road crossing there was a parking lot. There was a fellow there named Gary who was there with his friend doing Trail magic. So we had an apple cider, water, some Snickers, some donuts. We're going in to Bennington to resupply and Gary told us about a hiker friendly hotel called the Catamount. Gary was a particularly helpful fella. This was not a good place to hitchhike because it was on a downhill curve, there was no place to pull over and everybody was doing 60 miles an hour. Nobody had any phone reception. Gary walked around in the parking lot until he got reception at a particular spot and managed to organize a taxi cab for us. When the cab came he was not a regular cab but a medical shuttle. He didn't even understand how or why he got the call to come pick us up. That's how it seems to work for us. It just works out somehow. As we are getting in the cab a South African fella comes down off the trail and jumped in the cab. Charlie Horse came down off the trail as well. He couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to go into town or not so he didn't. We went in resupplied, had dinner, and crashed early. Gary said he'd be happy to give us a ride to the trail early. So we called Gary and arranged for a 5 a.m. Pick up.","

So Gary was there at 4:55. He was a bright ray of sunshine early in the morning, a very helpful, very friendly guy. He was happy to drop us off at the trail. So it was a good solid climb to get back up on the ridge. We like uphill, it's better. We did a nice job. We got to the first shelter pretty quickly and hiked on by. We got to the second Shelter by 10. It had gotten very, very windy. The wind was 25-30 miles an hour. It is always more exciting when the wind is blowing so strong. It reminded me of hiking through the Smokies. There the wind was in the 35 to 45 miles an hour range. The branches are swelling, waving,and snaping around above you which makes it a little unnerving. With the wind the temperature also dropped. While we were taking a break at the second shelter Rose, Ben and Gandolpho arrived. They were very pleased with their speed because they were at the first shelter that we had passed. Another 6 other southbound section hikers came by as well. It was quite a group of cold hikers as everybody was putting on their puffies and talkin about how cold it was in mid-June. We took a bit of a long break and then hiked on. At this point the clouds had covered over and it was very windy. It was a Rough Rocky Rooty Trail. That really affects your foot speed. You have to be incredibly specific about where you put your foot. You can easily twist an ankle, sprain a knee, or just tenderize some piece of your foot by putting all that pressure on a very small percentage of your foot surface. As a result you really slow way down. You can't get any momentum or rhythm going because each step is not connected to any other step. Each step is about safely putting your foot down on the trail. Our goal had been a 23 mile day to a particular campsite. As the day wore on we wore down. Gandolfo and Rose and Ben stopped at the next shelter for lunch. We had already taken our long break so we hiked right past Kid Gore shelter. This was not a view day but rather just make miles day. After our break we had passed this fire tower but because of the clouds and the cold wind there wasn't much to see. It's also on a very windy day incredibly cold climbing up on a fire tower. Eventually Gandolpho passed us and then Rose and Ben passed us. We r the early start, slow hikers on rhe trail. Somehow we all keep ending up in pretty much the same place and keep crossing paths. A little bit of the Tortoise and Hare story. We weren't on pace to be doing 2 miles an hour and get to are targeted campsite. So around 4 as it was misting and looking a lot like rain we decide to start looking for a stealth site. When We came to a footbridge crossing a creek. It had established stealth sites on both sides. We decided twenty one and a half miles was good for the day and stopped. As we were setting up camp Red Bird caught up to us. We left Bennington at 5 a.m. Res Bird left Pennington at 10 a.m. He was in a within a half a hour of us. We did 21 miles in 12 hours. He did 21 miles in 7 hours. So we invited him to camp with us. This was a big place. Soon after we got set up it started to rain. It rained a lot throughout the night. My tent was great and I was dry.","

I woke up to the rain on my tent. I wasn't motivated to jump up and get ready. It it wasn't like me but I fell back asleep. I woke up around 4:30 I could hear Ibex packing up her hammock. I had to pull myself together to take down my tent in the rain and pack up in the rain. Everything is heavier when it's wet. I'm not as excited about hiking in the rain after 2 foot infections. We got a late start at quarter of 6. Our goal was Manchester Center which was 18 and a half miles away. We estimate our arrival time to be 3 to 3:30 p.m. We would resupply there and based on how we are feeling possibly zero. It was a very cold, wet morning. This is the first time since early on that's my thumbs actually hurt from being cold. I had just sent home my last hat and I had no gloves. The start of our day was a long gradual 4 miles up Stratton Mountain the highest point in southern Vermont. Stratton Mountain was the emotional birthplace of the Vermont Long Trail and then that led to the insight to build the Appalachian Trail. It has quite a place in Appalachian Trail lore. It was good we were hiking uphill or we would have been very cold. I am really not carrying my cold weather gear anymore. This was a heads up for me that when I come back after Alaska I'll have my hiking fleece, Gore-Tex gloves, and a solid hat. I'm hoping to get away with my 25 degree bag for as long as possible. I'll have to go through some cold nights before I start carrying a heavier zero bag that I had at the beginning of the trip. I'm really spoiled about not carrying a lot of weight. Even with the base weigh 15.5 Everything feels heavy. I think my level of total fatigue is increasing. I just seem to be tired all the time. So when we get to the top Stratton Mountain we smell smoke. That's interesting because there's a cold wet mist blowing strongly across the mountain top. We come across a private shelter of the hiking club that maintains The Long Trail and the AT in Vermont. We stopped to put more clothes on for the downhill which will be cold cuz you're not working that hard. Jean and Hew pop out of the nice private shelter. They've been working on maintaining the trail for 50 years. We stop & talk for 15 minutes. They would have talked for hours but I was getting colder by the minutes. There was a fire tower here as well but in the driving cold misty rain it had no interest for me. As we're hiking off of Stratton Mountain Gandolpho passes by. He jokes about about the time I gave him sandwiches in the Shenandoahs. Then he askes do you have any sandwiches today to give away?? It's a good laugh and he goes on. We are hiking pretty steady. We cameled up on our water supply to start the day. We're looking to hike the whole 18 and 1/2 miles in without stopping again for water. We r carrying 1/4 of a liter for the day. 1/2 a pound. It's so cold it's not like we're sweating. Couple hours later Gandolpho also passes us again. He had stopped at a shelter for a snack. We actually hike along a little bit together. We get to the next shelter and he said he was going to get lunch. The shelter turns out to be a half a mile off the trail. We just sit right down there at the shelter sign w/o taking another step. We are pretty much eating everything in our food bag. We're not hiking in hungry but we are hiking in light. We head out a little before Gandolpho finishes. Red Bird catches up to the three of us by then. He wants to get into Manchester Center by 2 p.m. to catch the World Cup game. So he walks and talks for a minute as we walk. He then proceeds to run down the trail at a brisk pace backpack and all. We are all impressed. He moves much faster on the trail. At this point we're walking on a fire road together. When the trail breaks off and gets back to a single file Gandolpho picks up his pace and is gone. He's going into Manchester Center as well. We arrive in Manchester at 3. We are right on schedule. Takes about 2 minutes flag down or hitchhike a ride into town. The driver is nice woman who is an organic farmer. She drops us at the grocery store. We resupply and call a cab. The cab is there as we're checking out. We get a ride to Sutton Place which is where Gene and Hue recommended we stay right in the heart of town. We going to town for dinner and the main street is closed off. They're having a street fair of some kind tonight. So we get to experience Manchester Center Street Fair with live music and lots of local people hanging out and enjoying the evening. There was an amazing guy who was entertaining in front of the band. He would both w juggling and balancing with a big hoop taller than he was. He would roll upside down and could roll around in this hoop and do amazing things never losing his balance. It was quite a piece of local entertainment. It gets past hiker midnight and we have to crash.","

Amazingly, woke up around 7 a.m. Talk about sleeping in. Went to a little breakfast place called Upstairs for Breakfast. The food was great. The waitress was miserable. Went back to the room and slept for an hour. It was a beautiful day so we took some of our stuff down to a picnic table by the school and sprayed it with permethrin. Pretty much worked on my blog for the next couple hours. Ended up finding a shuttle driver who would pick us up a quarter of 5 and have it at the trail by 5.

Wayne was there at 4:45. He's a retired English teacher and turns out he taught at the same school that Frank who runs the Sutton house taught at. Frank was a French teacher. It was supposed to be hot and there was a nice red sunrise. Well the trail was very kind to me today. The trail surface was fairly walkable. What I mean by that is there were rocks and roots but you could find some dirt to put your feet on. There were also a lot of boardwalks as Vermont can be a very wet boggy place it appears. We started out as usual with the big climb up onto the ridge. We hiked to a ski resort that the founder of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer owns. It's pretty cool. The AT goes right up the ski slope. At the higher elevations the sound the bugs made was incredible. It almost reminded me of the Drone sound. Constant loud buzzing, lots of insects flying around. We weren't getting bitten but we did put our bug spray on heavy. We manage to maintain a 2 mile an hour pace all day and after 21 miles loaded up with water. At one time all of a sudden my phone exploded with a bunch of Father's Day messages. I didn't have reception long and all my responses went out the next day. We pretty much hike from water source to water source trying not to carry any water. Sometimes you get to where they say there is a water source and there is no water. So it can be a less than perfect operational plan. But today everything worked well. This was a day of very pleasant hiking. That's not to say the weren't big climbs or steep downhills. It is that my feet did not hurt and I was able to maintain some kind of pace and keep moving. If you have to watch every step because there's a sharp rock or slippery root you move very slowly. Or I should say I move very slowly cuz I don't want to end up hurt with a hike ending injury cuz I slipped on a rock or a wet root. Or I got a stress fracture in my feet like I've heard other people having. So when we got to the last water we weren't sure where we were going to find a stealth site. There was the next 3 miles had no cross roads or points of interest. About a quarter mile in there was an ideal stealth site that was just perfect. We set up, had dinner, reviewed the next day, stretched, and were sleeping by hiker midnight at 7pm. The next day it was supposed to be in the 90s with a heat index of 91. We were going to start either at 3 or 4 a.m. and try and finish before they heat of the day. I really enjoyed the hiking today. I also felt rested and to some degree really refreshed from the smooth Trail surface that was so hikeable. My feet did not hurt at all. A very nice Father's Day on all. I did see a lot of families out hiking on the trail today. I said Happy Father's Day to all the obvious fathers with their children. It caught some people by surprise. I thought it was a nice touch.","

We were up early and it was already warm. We were hiking by 3:50 a.m. It was hot and muggy right from the start. I didn't even put on my puffy on to start the morning when I was packing up. We hiked until 6:30 when we got to our first water source. It was beautiful 30 foot waterfall in a very nice Rocky Canyon. A great place to have breakfast. All my emails and responses went out and a flood of responses came back in. Also got a couple calls as well. Reception can be so spotty people tend to know to call when they get any mail cuz I must have some coverage at that moment in time. So I drank 2 liters of water because it's a hot day. Our next water was 5 miles away which would be two and a half hours. Again the trail was very walkable. I was really energized by the ability to get in a rhythm and keep moving. My feet did not hurt at all. We were looking to try and get to a place where we could stop for lunch close to the trail. We came across view site above the Rutland Airport and met The Fonz who had stealth camped on a great rock outcropping site overlooking the valley. Night hiking with his headlamp the night before he had slipped trying to get around a down tree and it smashed his leg. So he just camped for the night to see how it be in the morning, which turned out to be okay. He was hiking the Long Trail and was full of information. It's amazing how some of the rocks hold water like a sponge and stay wet when others appear bone-dry. We are working our way down a steep set of rockface and both of us sliped neither fell but we did both slip. The Fonz who was coming up behind us slipped as well. Wet Mossy rocks can be very ""greasy"" in the words of Charlie Horse. My friend Rich called and said he was heading to Maine passing where were we. I said we were going to be in to Rutland, VT to resupply. He said well let's try and meet for dinner we'll be up that way. So after I got a lunch of a quart of chocolate milk and 2 massive egg and cheese sandwiches and a liter of Gatorade we headed into Rutland. We ended up stopping at The Yellow Deli. It has to be one of the nicest, most accommodating, well organized hostels on the trail. There's beautiful woodwork and original paintings throughout. It's run by some form of religious organization that is a very soft sell. It is setup on a donation basis. We saw Joe Kool and Dom and Charlie Horses there as well. There are a half dozen other hikers there. There was a hiker soaking his foot cuz he had an infected toe. A common phenomena on the trail.","

Since I was out late last night with Rich and Kim and it was pouring rain this morning I got a late start. I didn't start hiking until like 7:30. The trail was wonderful Vermont Trail. But that I mean it was dirt and fairly smooth. It was always some place to put your foot flat on the ground. The woods were quite beautiful and we went through a variety of different types of forests. The hemlock and the white pine have the softest trails. They also can be fairly open in your understudy. On a downhill somehow I lost my balance and had a complete fall. In the process of fall there's a point where you give up trying to stay on your feet and you focus on how you're going to land. In this situation as usual it happened so fast but I'm not really sure why I fell. But as I was twisting around in the air trying to maintain me balance I knew this was a crash in the making. I was able to somehow land on my chest in the leaves in between two piles of rocks. 6 in either way I'm laying on my chest and face in piles of jagged granite. I was very pleased with my Landing. And actually came up quite happy that it was all fine. When you land face first inches from sharp granite it's easy to be happy. Everybody falls on this Trail. You don't think your extra clumsy or something. If you can fall get right back up without any major problems that's a successful fall. We went through a very nice State Park with lots of camping opportunities and Facilities. As we left the park we crossed a bridge that was over a very nice waterfall and stream. Vermont it's just such a nice date through. There was some good up and down for the trail surface friendly is just enjoyable hiking so. So we were hiking from water source to water source. That way I'm not caring a lot of wait in the form of water. On this day I did plan to get water at a certain location and then look for stealth spot. There was no mortar for about 5 miles after that. Somehow I missed the Stream, the stream was dry and the Water Source was undependable. Either way I got to the point where it was the end of the day and there was no water for the evening I got a second wind of energy and was able to hike on. There was a icon on the guide for a lookout house. This was private property off the trail with no water available. However it said that you could camp there and that you could the rooftop ladder have been repaired. So after hiking 2 miles past where I thought I would get water I had a sense that I was close. We checked goshawks and it was only a tenth of a mile away. After hiking intensive while it was another two tenths of a mile into the house. When you've been sleeping in a tent or you realize you're far far from civilization it's amazing how outstanding the simplest structure kansiime. This was a nice cabin date windows, adore that shut, and a fireplace,. It also has a second for sleeping deck. Outside it had a lot or off the side of the house and side of the roof to an observation deck. The view from this desk was outstanding. It was a 360 degree view. I had to wear my puffy cuz it was cold Wendy. It always is when you go up on this observation Jackson Fire Towers. So we ate dinner up on the observation deck. This is one of the better views of the entire Trail. It was green and every direction and you could see layer after layer after layer of mountains. I'm not very good at telling what I'm looking at in terms of the specific mountains or directions. But this was just romantic and it's Beauty. This was the Green Mountain State at its best. And it's a private property opportunity that people are sharing with hiker on the trail. We thought of camping right at the house or even just treat it like a shelter and sleeping inside. It would be much easier than setting up our tent and and hammock. But I told other people might come in later and be noisy and that would not be good sleeping. So we went back down the trail a bit and still in the woods. That was such a good idea. I believe Ulysses and view where the first to show up. They were fairly reasonable. Then there are three other guys one of them literally running up the hill. I called them the noisy boys. They were ridiculously loud. They sounded very loud to us stealthing down the trail. I can only imagine how loud it sounded to Ulysses and you. Around 8:30 or so the noisy boys decided to hike on and leave everybody a chance to some sense of a good night sleep.","

I was up early and went up to the Lookout cabin to get the food bags that were hung there. View and Ulysses were sleeping inside. I climbed up the ladder to check out the view before sunrise. It was spectacular again. There was a nice red/orange sunrise developing. Went back told Ibex that the sun rise was going to be spectacular. So we packed up quickly. We took breakfast back up top on the rooftop deck. We got up just in time as the sunrise started to peak out over the mountain range. I got some good photos of the sunrise in action. So we had breakfast watching the sun rise. We got another late start probably around 5:30 a.m. As we were hiking, we passed Joe Kool and Dom stealthing by the trail. After 2 miles we had to stop and hike 1/4 Mile into a shelter to get some water. Normally we wouldn't hike a half a mile in to get water. However we didn't have any water to start the day. As we were hiking into the shelter Charlie Horse was hiking out. Charlie Horse starts even earlier than I do. He had stopped into the shelter for breakfast. He said it wasn't much of a shelter. He was a hundred percent right. It didn't even have a table to sit at. There was a small water source. I drank a liter and a half of water, ate 2 bars and headed back out. Passed Ulysses on the way out of the shelter. He needed to get water as well. Ulysses is such a nice guy, from Eastern New Hampshire. He told us how crowded the trails and shelters get on the weekends. Up here everybody heads into the woods on the weekends. We went through some beautiful total Hemlock Forest, where the only thing on the ground is hemlock needles. It's a very open understudy and you can see quite a distance. We also were surprised by the open fields that we ended up walking through. Maryland and Pennsylvania are known for their open fields. These are some beautiful fields loaded with wildflowers. It was really picturesque.
Joe Kool and Domatello had passed us earlier. We came across them a couple times today. Sometimes they hike a little faster but they take a lot of breaks. One of times they passed us was just before a hill. We had some steep furious climbs today. At the top of one of the climbs we passed again. We hiked down to a road crossing and we came across some Trail Magic. So we stopped. Joe Kool & Domatello caught up to us. I've been calling Domatello Ginger for the last month or so. It turns out Dom's mother has been reading my blog. So she asked Domatello if he knew of a Lotus on the trail. I met Domatello back before Harpers Ferry before the halfway point. Dom had hiked in with Joe Kool at 10 p.m. after doing a Dirty 30. So we've been crossing paths the last eight hundred miles. Funny thing is that Dom calls his sister a Ginger. He doesn't think he's a Ginger but he really is. Now here is his sister saying Lotus calls you Ginger on the trail. So we all had a good laugh and a good time. The trail is such an emotional challenge. It's very helpful to have these emotional connections with people. It's something that the author of Appalachian Trials spoke of entirely during his book. There's lots of physical challenges but the bottom line is can you emotionally handle the entire Trail with all of its isolation, physical challenges, and weather challenges. So to see some of the same people for 800 miles is a great support. Everybody is working through their challenges as they are presented.
We passed through a beautiful Lodgepole Pine Forest. It seems to stand out cuz I'm not familiar with them being on the East Coast. We also walked along some very high stone walls. Some of them were as high as I am tall. I did get a picture of that. The stonewalls, they were cool.
We completed our mileage for the day and came to our last water source. After gathering our water and filtering our water, we are eating and drinking. We are discussing how much further we might hike in looking for a stealth spot. Joe Kool and Dom happened along. We must have crossed pathes 3 or 4 times today. Being so close to water in the morning is nice. If you carry 2 liters of water, that's another 4.4 lbs. At the end of the day that's a whole lot of weight. If you don't center the water in your backpack it throws you all out of whack and you are imbalanced. We ended up just walking up the gully and stealth camping and not going anywhere. It turned out to be a very dark night.","

More beautiful Vermont hiking. Vermont has moved into being my favorite state so far for pleasant hiking. I'd come back here any time to hike. We were heading into New Hampshire. I set getting to New Hampshire as a goal before I left for Alaska back in February. I really didn't think two months ago that I had much of a chance getting to New Hampshire before Alaska. But today the goal was to cross the Connecticut River and go in to Hanover, New Hampshire. We hiked over a river where there used to be a little hiker resupply store. It had been flooded out during a hurricane and never reopened. As we hiked across the bridge a woman on the porch a bit away hollered ""do you want coffee or soda?"" These Trail angels are all over the place. You never know when they're going to pop out and be there for you. We were in pretty good shape to get into Hanover and didn't need anything. So we said thank you and hiked on. We did a certain amount of road walking because we were going under Route 93. We passed some very nice Vermont architecture. I also got a picture standing in front of the Podunk road sign. As we hiked down to the town to cross the Connecticut River into Hanover, we came to 2 Trail Angel roadside places. The second one had cold watermelon and some kind of pumpkin walnut bread. We talked to the fellow in the yard for quite a while. We also took a picture of 15 or so homes in Hanover area that would put up hiker for free. There's also free shuttles. It's a special kind of culture along the trail did I just don't see replicated very many times. There are just hundreds of people along the 2000 miles that are just willing to help total strangers as they walk through town or walk by. It's very nice to be on the receiving end of so much love and support. It just makes your day so worthwhile. We then hiked into Norwich, Vermont. Which is the corresponding town to Hanover. The term Norwich has always stood out to me as a military term. I got an education as to why that was from the Town Square. This is a very old American town and some of its residents have had a huge impact on the military education and development of our armed services. So we walked across the Connecticut River. Wow, we made it to New Hampshire. I wouldn't have bet money on getting to NH before leaving for Alaska with my sister. We hiked into Hanover. I asked a fellow on the street where should you eat. He said Molly's. We continue down the main street of Hanover, home of Dartmouth College. We found Molly's right next to town hall. We went in and ate so much food it was ridiculous. The bread-and-butter there was absurdly good. We had two baskets of bread to start. I staggered back out into the street. It had gotten very hot. The plan had been to hike into to Hanover, eat, do a quick resupply and be out of there in an hour. I was so full I couldn't walk across the street. I laid down on a shady small piece of grass in front of the Town Hall and fell asleep. There were a couple street vendors there. Everybody was so pleasant and welcoming. I called my sister Susan to touch base. In this town if you go to the pizza shop as a hiker you get a free piece of pizza. I went to the bakery. I got a free baked good for walking in the door. They go out of their way to welcome you to Hanover. Ulysses came by and we talked for a while. He's taking it double zero. He says the next 40 miles are fairly doable. Then you get to Moosilauke and you're in for real climbing. Eagle came by as well. He wasn't emotionally bearing so well. We had a good talk. He hiked on. By 4:30 we had to make a decision are we leaving this town or staying in this town. It was very hot. We decided to hike on out of town. We needed to go make some miles in New Hampshire. We met John up from Tennessee to hike up to Katahdin from Hanover. He just got into town at 4 pm. We ended up hiking out of Hanover with him. We connected so he decided to just hike with us for his first day. We had some steep sections and one section had a rope with knots in it draped over the rocks. It would have been quite a difficult challenge without the rope to give you a little hand hold to get up. 4 miles out of Hanover we came to our water source. So we cameled up, drank a liter and a half, carried a liter and a half and commenced to hike on and look for a stealth spot. John, it turns out, is quite the athlete. He's a heavy-set guy who was a state finalist wrestler and now is a big-time weightlifter. He has a food sponsor that provides him all his food. He was really quite an enjoyable guy to hike with and talk to. We invited him to stealth with us which he gladly accepted. Phone reception is always a challenge on the trail. In the guide book it said phone reception on the western edge of the cemetery out of town. We were just walking by the cemetery. I thought it was pretty cute to mention where phone reception might be. We must have been on the Eastern side because there was no phone reception. So probably a half a mile after getting water we found a almost perfect stealth spot. You could hear the road so it wasn't perfect. By the time I got my tent setup it was already getting dark. That means it's a couple hours after hike their midnight. That means I'm not getting as much sleep as I would like to be getting. oh well that's what happens when you take a 4-Hour break in Hanover and enjoy the local culture. These last couple days I've been moving in a slightly different pace. I've been enjoying the moments. I haven't been on quite they got to make my miles schedule that I've been on. I've traveled 600 miles in the last 35 days which included four zeros total. That's a lot of miles everyday. I think that's what gets to you, is the cumulative effect of every day every day every day.","

We were up and hiking by 5 a.m. There looked to be some bigger climbs today. Ulysses said of the two days, 40 miles to get to Mt. Moosilauke the second day would be harder. So there were some good climbs right off the bat. It warmed up. I'm tired so I'm glad this first day would be the easier day. It was much warmer then the weather report had indicated. Our first climb was up Moose Mountain. We were going from 850 feet up to 2300 ft. The we went back down to 900 feet. Then we climbed 1100 ft to 2000 feet. That was Holt's ledge. Then we drop back down to 880 ft and then we were climbing up to Smart mountain at 3200 ft. After Holt's ledge who pops up but Cody Coyote. I have come to really enjoy Cody Coyote. I've also learned quite a bit fro him in his quiet way. He doesn't try and teach anybody anything. If you watch him you will learn how to hike this trail and survive on very little. Cody doesn't have a phone. He typically doesn't even have that much food on any given day. We had a nice little chat with him. Then he glides on. When we hiked up to Smart's Mountain it's a pretty serious climb, an over 2,000 feet increase in elevation. When we had been on a Holt's Ledge I could look over and see a firetower on another mountain. I really didn't think I was hiking that far today. That fire tower looks really far away. The sun was pretty hot and I was getting very used up. Then I became aware that yes I was actually hiking towards that firetower. Then I was going to have another 5 miles after getting to that fire tower to finish tbe 21 mile day I had planned. I or originally thought we could do 23 miles today, but that was just ridiculous. What you are thinking and planning for the day between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. often goes out the window by 3 p.m. There's a real difference between what you think you can do, like to do, and what you can physically do. I really lost my motivation. It was very hot. We had done a lot of climbing and ridge walking in direct sunlight. There's probably a 20 degree difference between being in the Green Tunnel of the Trail and open exposure to the Sun. The afternoon was moving on. The granite ridge was exposed to the hot sun for 5 hours It then radiates heat back up to you. The sun is beating down on you, the rocks are beating up on you, you're a hot mess. Like I said I was losing steam and motivation. I keep saying ""glad this is the easy day"" because if it got harder than this I'm not making it today . I don't know how they described this as an easy day. It scares me to think of what tomorrow will be like if this is the easy day. Ibex said we got this. She was feeling strong and ready to roll. We get to a section of Smarts Mountain and it's a 17% uphill climb. There's places with a lot of steps, places with wood ladders built on top of the rock, and rebar iron ladders to help you scamper up the rock. So this was a tough pull this afternoon. I was feeling pretty done. In a spot like this there's no place to get off just cuz you're tired, used up or don't feel like you can go on. They're very few roads that would provide extraction points for the exhausted and worn out hiker. The trail gets very tight towards the top. By that I mean the fir trees on either side are crowding the trail so you are constantly pushing the trees apart as you walk. The branches are always there. We get to the top around 3. We take our puffies pack are food and head up to the top of the fire town. The view is spectacular. There's a glass top that is way too hot. So we sit one level down and enjoy dinner and an hour's worth of food and beauty. Honey Bear comes up the tower as well. She's hiking alone and looking to put in 27 miles today. We've done about 15, almost crushed us. After enjoy ourselves for an hour we head down and get back on the trail. Again the trail is very tight on the downhill of Smarts Mountain. I counted 21 piles of moose scat on the 4 mile downhill hike. We come to a beautiful bridge over pretty strong stream, South Jacobs Brook. This is the first water source we came to. So while we are drawing water and filtering water who shows up Joe Kool and Dom. We hang out and talk. We camel up and carry a liter and a half each as we head up to look for a stealth site. Within a half a mile we find one and camp for the night","

We got a late start out at 5:30. We are pretty light on food. I had a pumpkin muffin and an apple for breakfast. I had three bars to get me to a resupply today. We immediately started a climb up Mount Cube. We're going from 1400 feet 2280ft. On the way up a woman, Shobat caught up to us. She asked if somebody had lost a knife. As it turned out, Ibex had lost her knife. Shobat was nice enough to have picked it up, caught up, and returned it to her. That's how the trail works. She had stayed at the shelter the night before. There were four other people at the shelter. They were all new to her and she didn't remember their names. I was able to identify the people she stayed with. She had stayed with Charley Horse, Cody Coyote and two others that I knew. She talked about how Cody had a roaring fire going within it seemed like 2 or 3 minutes of arriving at the shelter. That's Cody's trademark. Some people on the trail like, Gumby call him the Fire Whisperer. I seen Kody build that fire in the first couple minutes more than once. He doesn't really say anything or greet anybody. He goes about his business and gets his fire going first. Then he'll say hello. Cody likes that name Fire Whisper. The climb up to the mountain was fairly steep and she moved on. I am definitely moving slower these days. The key seems to be to just keep moving. It's not how fast you make the miles it is that you make the miles. We could hear voices in the distance and I recognized Joe Kool and Dom. It took us awhile to catch up. It seems Joe Kool had just pulled a deer tick out of his leg that morning. He's had three deer ticks on him in the first 2 days in New Hampshire. Joe Kool doesn't believe in long pants, permethrin or many other tick prevention methods. He does use 100% DEET as a bug repellent. We talked for a while about the deer tick situation. I've been treated three times in my life for deer tick bites. Regular ticks I can feel on me immediately. Deer ticks seem to escape my attention. That's why I wear long pants no matter how hot it is. That is why I also spray everything with permethrin. I sprayed my pack, tent, and everything else until they are soaking wet with chemical. So we get to the top of Cube Mountain. They're beautiful views in every direction. We hike down to Bracket Brook which is the last water source for 9 miles. We camel up and take a half a liter for the nine mile journey. It is much cooler today and looking like rain. We come across Joe Kool and Dom again. Dom tells us about Carl The Omelette man. Word on the trail is Carl The Omelette man set up camp up ahead before Mount Moosilauke. It seems, Carl The Omelette man makes omelets from 9 to 5 everyday now that he's set up this year. Yesterday was his first day. What with 2 bars left to go 9 miles that would be good news if we could come across Carl. When we come to the gravel road Cape Moonshine Road who do we find but Carl The Omelette man. Carl is set up under a tarp structure. It's probably 30 feet by 10 feet. Carl has homemade chocolate peanut butter gooey fudge cookies. They're so calorically rich just smelling them adds calories to your diet. He has a variety of drinks. He has a charging station for your electronics. He has pastries. AND he makes Incredible, not to be duplicated, or matched anywhere, phenomenal omelettes. He'll put five to eight eggs in with a mess of red onions, green peppers, and I don't know what other vegetables, and then he slices in a whole bunch of cooked Virginia ham. Once that's all cooking, he literally takes 15 seconds pouring on the shredded cheese until it's for 5 inch in the cast iron skillet like a erupting volcano. He cooks it all up, piles it up on a paper plate that barely holds it. Then he serves it. His record was somebody eating 30 eggs. I am definitely not trying to break anybody's omelette record today. I do thoroughly enjoy eating my omelette avoiding the Virginia ham. There's Charley Horse, Cody Coyote, a southbound hiker, and a fella from Boiling Springs who thinks he knows Rickless Morty from Boiling Springs there when we arrive. The hiker who found Ibex knife, Shobat is also there. I text Dom Carl The Omelette man's location. Soon enough Joe Kool and Dom show up. So Carl is feeding 8 hikers an enormous amount of food. All this without any mention, question, or idea of money in the picture. Carl's been doing this for 4 years. This was the latest he's ever started. So I eat and we move on. I'm still getting very tired. Yesterday did seem to be a much harder day. I'm glad for that. If yesterday had been the easier of the two days I wouldn't have made our goal of 16 miles today. It seems like we're hiking up Mount Mist forever which is our last climb before Moosilauke. We're going from 900 feet to 2200ft. They say we're in for a big storm around four. After mountain Mist on the way down we bumped into Squeeze. We haven't seen Squeeze since Dalton. Sweets was debating whether to ride out the storm at the hostel at New Hampshire 24 or go on. We had wanted to do Mount moosilauke e tomorrow. We were so beat we just couldn't even begin to think about that. So I used to work in New Hampshire and she called an old supervisor. He picked us up and we went to his place.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599800,"Fri/Sat Day 133/134, 7/27,28 So after the 3 weeks in Alaska with a week combined to travel we are ready to go back to the trail. But they're predicting major rain and thunderstorms all week. Never a good plan to be on a mountain top in New Hampshire in a thunderstorm with lightning. So we postpone our return to the trail until Friday, July 27th. We Uber to the 30th Street Station and get on a Megabus. 30th Street Station is really quite an impressive building that I had never been in before. The Megabus stop is out on the Drexel campus. It's next to the Bolt bus stop, which is an hour late, so there a lot of people out waiting for the bus. Our bus is late by 20 minutes. It arrives. We managed to get in a seat only to learn that there are certain seats that are reserved and I'm in one of them. We end up in the very back of the bus on the last seat. If you have ridden in many buses you know it's not the place to sit. It was very uncomfortable and the windows had some kind of Megabus advertisement over them so they were all a blur. When we get to Secaucus Station some people get off. People in the back of the bus are looking to move up. One fellow signals me up ahead that he's going to double up with somebody and leave a double seat open. I jump up and grab that seat. This is a way better seat with a clear window and you're not bouncing, rocking and being so uncomfortable. This is a double decker bus, so you have quite a nice view from the top deck, which is where we are. 7 hours later we arrive at the Boston bus station. We have a 2 hour wait there. I end up in the wrong bus line but we figure it out. We get on the right bus. We have a 4 hour bus ride up to Lincoln, New Hampshire where we left off. We are moving at a very relaxed pace because we're not really expecting to do anything except get to Kinsman Notch. We stop in a bagel restaurant, have a good lunch, packing out a meal as well for dinner tonight and head out to Kinsman Notch, which is the northern base of Mount Moosilauke. Today hitch hiking is pretty slow. Lots of tourists going by, and tourists don't pick up hitchhikers in general. It takes locals who support the hiking community. It takes close to an hour to get out to Kinsman Notch. The fella who picks us up has hiked some of the AT with his son, who hiked all of the AT. It's one pm and we go on the trail to look for a stealth site cuz we're really not planning to start hiking after spending 12 hours in a bus; uncomfortable, cramped up 12 hours. There's an immediate water source so we get water. We decide to hike up to the Beaver Brook shelter only a mile and a half in. It's the most difficult, steepest part of the climb up over Mount Moosilauke. So we separate our food. We hike into the woods and hang our bear bags. We will come back tomorrow find our bear bags and then carry all that heavy food, which is four days of food. We only take in one dinner and one breakfast. We start hiking up Mount Moosilauke. Now we're going southbound. It's a very, very steep up southbound direction. I would rather hike up very steep then descend in a very steep situation. For me it's safer to climb hand over hand up. I do a lot better. Mount Moosilauke is a stunning climb. There's a sign at the beginning of it. It says ""this trail is extremely difficult. If you're not experienced it's best not to take this trail. Take special care in the Cascades to avoid tragic results"". I have hiked 1800 miles and I've never seen a sign like that on the Appalachian Trail. There's a rushing torrent of cascading water that the trail follows up. It's been raining heavy for a week. Everything is wet. Wet slippery rocks and roots is not what I want to be going downhill on. So I'm very happy to be working our way up a very steep grade. It is sunny and a perfect day to be crossing Mt. Moosilauke. It's spectacularly beautiful as we hike up along this river. We see lots of day hikers and northbound through hikers. We make it up there to the Beaver Brook shelter by like 3:30. So we get water and decide well let's just push on to the next shelter on the other side of the summit. We've done the steepest part of the climb already. About a half a mile from the summit it gets suddenly very cold. Then a very cold rain starts. This is hiking in the Whites of New Hampshire. Technically we're not even in the Whites yet, but this is New Hampshire hiking so it's now raining pretty hard. Of course when we get to the top there's no view at all because it's driving cold rain. Typically there are spectacular views from Moosilauke because it's above tree line. We just keep moving on and work our way down. The top of Moosilauke is above tree line at 4800 ft. It is covered with sharp rocks like Pennsylvania. As we work our away down the other side I end up falling 3 times. I slip a half a dozen times. The difference between a fall and a slip is that on a fall my torso ends up on the ground. I slip six times. One time I slipped into a tree and the broken branch jabbed into my arm and broke off. It was a small branch. I had Ibex pull it out for me. She could get a better angle on it. Only on one of my falls did it hurt. I've learned to fall gracefully, or at least to head for a soft landing. Often it's when you least expect it and it's not a technically difficult spot. Usually a fall in a technically difficult spot results in serious injury. My feet went out from under me and I landed hard on my hip and my elbow and that jammed up into my shoulder. That didn't feel good. We're trying to make it to the next shelter before dark and it's taking us longer than we think it should. I guess after you fall 3 times you slow down. This was difficult, pay-attention hiking. It was getting darker and we wanted to make the shelter before dark. Hiking on wet slippery rocks and roots in the dark is not fun. We finally get to the shelter around 9:15. It took us 7 hours to hike 9 miles. We are used to covering ground much faster. We set up the tent and go up to the shelter to eat before we go to sleep. We set an alarm so that we can be back on the trail by 6:30, cuz we estimate that we are a one hour hike from Hikers Welcome Hostel. We know there's a shuttle leaving at 8am to take us back to Kinsman Notch. We're hoping to find PT there so we can start hiking with him as well.","

It was a nice gentle downhill. Just before New Hampshire 25 we had to cross a river. I should say we had to ford a small river. We found the hostel, Hikers Welcome, a quarter mile or so down the road. We were delighted to find PT sitting at the table when I walked in the door. We took the shuttle at 8 around Mt Moosilauke to Kinsmans Notch. We retrieved our food bags from the woods. We set our sights for Kinsman Pond Shelter 12 miles away. As usual, it was super steep out of the notch. The day proved to be very challenging with a lot of hand over hand climbing. It was very wet and there was a lot of water to be avoided. It seemed to take forever. We were averaging a mile an hour. To our surprise, we just seemed to be wiped out. After 5 miles, it appeared we were not going to be making Kinsman Pond Shelter today. We took a nice lunch on a sunny little spot instead. I fell asleep and had a nice nap. We ended up going to the Eliza Brook Shelter 7.9 miles in. It was a very nice shelter with only two older fellas there when we arrived. By the time we went to sleep there had been a group of 20 come in and stay at the group campsite and probably another 10 people in the shelter and tent sites.","

We passed Kinsman Pond Shelter, our goal from the day before. As we gained in elevation, we were rewarded with some beautiful views. As the sun was coming up it was overcast so we didn't get the classic sunrise but we did get very nice views. Who would have thought that 10 or 11 miles miles was just too far. Well, this is the Whites and things go a lot slower. We were coming around to the thought that if we could hike faster than one mile an hour we were making good time. We did very nicely and enjoyed the day. We got to the last mile and a half in good time. We came to a water source. The trail had been very nice today and we were very comfortable. We seem to be ahead of schedule and figured to be getting in this afternoon ahead of schedule. So we didn't take time to get more water and just headed up the hill. Suddenly the trail got extremely steep, rocky and difficult. The sun came out very hot. We were sweating like mad. I wasn't feeling well at all. Suddenly a day that have been going smoothly was extremely challenging. We had to stop and eat a plum just to regroup because the trail was so steep. We finally made it to the Liberty Springs campsite. The last mile and a half seem to take forever. We were both completely crushed by the intensity and difficulty of the last mile and a half. The hot sun was part of the problem. We shared a tent platform with a father son team. This was a first for me. A tent platform is a little different because every time anybody moved on the platform you felt the vibrations underneath you. By hiker midnight I was ready to go to sleep. The sun was shining in our tent as we were facing west. If we had stayed up, we would have watched the sun go down. It looked to me to be a nice sunset coming that I missed as I fell asleep exhausted.","

We were up at 4 a.m. We packed up and moved away from the tent platform. We went to eat at the common eating area so as to not disturb our fellow platform sleepers. We had a good breakfast but didn't get up on the trail until quarter of 6. We continued the steep climb up for 4/10 of a mile towards Liberty Mountain Summit. We made a left turn onto Franconia Ridge. It was gentle hiking along the ridge. Then we started the ascent of 3 peaks. The first was Mountain Lincoln, which was very nice. We did get to see a nice sunrise coming up to our right as we crossed the ridge. We were now above tree line when we summited Mount Lafayette. The views were quite spectacular in every direction. Because we knew we were in for such challenging climbing in the Whites, we made a point to constantly be eating. So we took a break and ate for a while. We saw some kind of little mountain weasel dashing around the mountain top waiting for us to leave to see if we had dropped any food crumbs. We did see the Greenleaf Hut from the top of Mount Lafayette. It was a one mile journey if you wanted to stay at that hut. No way we were doing another tough two miles just to get to a hut and back. We continued to hiking above tree line. It was really quite spectacular. These were the best views in 1800 miles. Even though it seemed to be a perfect day, I wasn't feeling all that well. We were hiking well but I just felt like I was running out of gas. Our goal had been a 13 or 16 mile day. That would set us up for one more day of hiking before taking a zero at my friend, Peter and Patty Mongeau's. As the day wore on, I wore out. I had a sore throat, was quite congested, and even felt a little faint at one point. Feeling faint when you're hiking on granite is a bad story. We stopped to get water and then the trail literally was in a stream-an active, wet stream bed going steeply downhill. The Whites were looking to be extremely rugged. We were stunned at how difficult it was to make our way down the side of this mountain in a stream bed on wet slippery rocks. We were moving very, very slowly. Each step had the potential to be a hike-ending tragic disaster. As we approached Twin Mountain we had only covered 9 miles. We were looking to get water at the Galehead Hut. It was supposed to rain Wednesday and Thursday. We were trying to make at least 13 to 16 miles of the 25 miles so that we could finish on Wednesday with 12 miles or less to go. Now it was looking like if we can't make even 10 miles, we'll have to split the last 15 mi between Wednesday and Thursday and not get off the mountain until Thursday. We're trying to avoid hiking on these severe steep up and downs in the rain. Wet rocks are greasy, slippery rocks. When we were 8/10 of a mile away from Galehead Hut on an uphill I just felt so bad that I didn't want to go on at all. This is the first time in 1800 miles that I just called it quits in the middle of the day. I was done and I just didn't want to go another step. There was a stealth campsite at the trail crossing. I just stopped. We set up the tent and I went to sleep in the afternoon. I was scared. Maybe I had picked up some water born illness or some mosquito born illness. Was this some problem that somehow was going to take me off the trail? It's kind of scary and depressing because you're always worried that something is going to take you off the trail. I hadn't been sick at all in seven months. Now I felt horrible and couldn't take another step. After a couple hours of sleeping I woke up. I got up and ate some dinner. I didn't really want to eat much. Not a good sign for a hiker. There was some commotion on the trail which we were very close to. There was an older French man who went in without carrying a pack. It seemed a group of women had been hiking and one of them had gotten hurt. So he went in to help carry out her pack and gear. I soon went back to sleep well before hiker midnight.","

Woke up at four without any intentions. Really didn't make a plan for today. We had talked to PT the day before. He was taking today, August 1st, as a zero to avoid the heavy rains that had been forecast for today. I felt somewhat better but I didn't know whether it was a fake better and as soon as I start a hike I would feel terrible. We hiked a stiff, steep uphill eight tenths of a mile. We got to the Galehead Lodge at 5:40. People were already moving around. The staff was up cooking. A number of hikers were in the dining area or milling about the building. This is the most remote of the huts in the Whites. There was a lot of history about how this hut was established and how the men and mules carried the lumber and tools in to build this hut in 1933, during the Depression. It was a spectacular, beautiful location with great views. I took some pictures of the bunk rooms. These Huts are all sold out months if not years in advance. I was feeling okay after that steep climb. We had run out of water the day before so we were hydrating quite heavily today. We were supposed to get here and fill up with water yesterday but I just couldn't make it yesterday. There was a strange quiet in the hut. People talked in low voices or not at all. Many people were stretching. They had very nice bathrooms. At 6:30 they started to serve breakfast. I told them I was at through hiker. They said they couldn't serve any food for through hikers until eight am. I already consumed 2 two liters of cold water. So with that news and carrying a half lieter, we headed out. No sense waiting an hour and a half for some food. We were facing two days left on the trail, a day extra that we hadn't planned. So we were really running short on food, but we weren't waiting an hour and a half for whatever they were serving. Our next water source was the Zealand Falls Hut seven miles away. This was where we were trying to get to the day before. Now we were going to be just trying to get maybe three or four miles past it to call it a day. It was very nice hiking and the trail was very accommodating. We made excellent time and got to the Zealand Falls Hut by 11. We showed our through hiker pass that we had gotten at Liberty Springs. I got a baked good and Ibex got the soup. I also bought the pasta lunch. Being short of food, we were trying to stock up. We were pleased we had made such good time getting here in four hours. We thought it would take us seven, cuz everything seems to go one mile an hour in the Whites. I talked to the girls who were working there. They said the trail down to Crawford Notch was a highway. You could make three miles an hour or better. So we ate all the food we had except for a couple bars. We thought maybe we could make it the eight miles down before dark and hitch hike down the Peter and Patty's. Well, they were right. The trail was wide and dirt. Every time you crossed a stream it would be rocky, but it was a beautiful Virginia type trail. We were so stunned that we originally thought we might be able to make it by five or six p.m. Now we started thinking we might be able to make it there by four p.m. We kept quite a pace and did the eight miles down at three miles per hour in three hours. Probably didn't need to go so fast cuz my knee bothered me a little the next day. I didn't know it was going to be fast all the way. It took us a while hitch hiking but finally a local picked us up and drove us to Bartlett. He said normally he would take us further, but with the traffic so heavy it was going on four in the afternoon. He wasn't going to brave the intense traffic in Conway. I gave Patty a call and she came and picked us up. So here we ended up doing 15 miles in one day when we weren't even sure we'd be able to do 9 miles. Making plans is just a way of structuring and evaluating what you're able to accomplish today. We don't seem to be able to follow through on any particular plan perfectly well. We just keep making miles and see where we end up. Our next section will be up over Mount Washington. I don't think we'll be able to plan that too exactly either. We ended up coming out on Wednesday. It started to rain when we were in the car, so we missed all the rain, which was perfect.","

Was still feeling very congested and full of mucus almost to the point of choking in my sleep. Went to Walmart and bought some cold and severe symptoms over-the-counter medication. Slept a lot.

So my friend, Peter, drops us off at Crawford Notch on Route 302. It is just getting dark as we start to hike the trail. We hike the 1/4 Mile in and I can see the bridge crossing the Swith River. Ibex points out there are sticks on the trail that I just walked over. It said PT with an arrow to the right. We start talking and we hear PT'S Voice. It's a bit of an emotional reunions cuz I haven't physically seen PT in 3 months, since I left Irwin, back in March. We set up our stealth tent camp using one of PT's stakes to tie down our tent. I brought in a resupply food bag for PT. We agree on the plan to be on the trail by 4 a.m., so it we have a shot at the six bunk spaces at Lake of the Clouds. I get to sleep around 10. I'm up at 2:30 stretching on four and a half hours of sleep. I wake everybody else up at 3. We're up and hiking at 4. It's straight up out of Crawford Notch. Somehow, we get off trail not once, but twice. First time we picked it up pretty quick. The second time we got turned around and hiked downhill 10 minutes. Nobody wants to hike extra miles on a steep grade up or down. We get it figured out using Guthooks. It's a long tough uphill for the first couple hours. The views along Webster cliffs are spectacular. You pop in and out of the trees for over half a mile with repeated beautiful views. The climb levels out a little bit after Mount Jackson. It's a gradual tough climb as you go past Mount Pierce, alongside Mount Eisenhower, Mount Franklin, and finally Mount Monroe. It's been beautiful views all day. It's also been a long steady climb from 1277 feet up to 5047 feet. We've taken a lot of pictures but we're really starting to wear out. Finally, the Lake of the Clouds Hut comes into sight as we round Mount Monroe. Mount Washington is to our right as we head in to Lake of the Clouds. We thought we'd arrive at 1:30 and arrive at 12:30 instead. We are the first to ask for rooms in the dungeon. There are six bunks in the dungeon. We are taking 50% of them. We spend the afternoon eating and waiting to see who else might come. The dungeon is a six bunk stone square with an iron door. It is available all winter even when they close down the Hut above it. It is an emergency shelter, very basic. It smells dank. Katie, the girl who was with Castle earlier on the trail back in the Smokies, comes in with Pit Boss. She has lost a lot of weight. They talk about staying in the dungeon. That would be a drag. They decide to hike on. Summit of Mount Washington ducks in and out of the clouds. Three times it shows its face and I run outside to get a picture but the clouds cover it again before I can. After a while, Thumper arrives. She has been hiking with PT earlier. So there is bunk space number four. Then another fellow comes that PT knows and that is bunk space number 5. Everyone talks about getting up at 5 a.m. I talked about possibly getting up to see the sunrise on Mount Washington. Because of my lack of sleep and how tired I feel I think it's more important to get to sleep in until 5 a.m. By 7 PT, Ibex, and I are all in falling asleep. I have to get up in the middle of the night and it's really quite difficult getting in and out of these tight bunks. When I wake up in the morning and only then do I realize that the 6th bunk got taken by a southbounder who came in around 8 PM, that I was totally unaware of. The other hikers who slept upstairs on a work for stay program didn't get to sleep until after 11 AM and we were up eating and waking them up at 5 a.m. Staying in the dungeon was a very good look. It may smell dank and look dirty but it's a great place to get a good night sleep. All I wanted was a good night sleep.","

Lotus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600428,"Mon Day 144 8/6 Mt. Washington
I wake up at 4 but fall back asleep until 5, very unlike me. I must be tired. Like a big alarm went off, all six people are up at 5 a.m. getting ready to roll on. Everybody takes care of their business, packing up without any problems or conflicts in a very tight space, literally 8 feet by 8 feet. Due to the dank smell, we had to prop the door open to let the room air while we were sleeping during the night. We do see a mouse scuring around our area but nobody's food bag was bothered. We go upstairs to eat breakfast in the grand room. This is a very nice, large dining area. They can probably sleep 60 people comfortably in bunks, maybe even 80. The views are great from the dining hall. There are 10 or 12 through hikers, who came in after us, who chose work for stay so that they could sleep on the floor in the dining hall. With six of us dungon dwellers moving around the dining hall everybody starts getting up. Thru-hikers are an early bunch in general. We eat and head out. Thumper is hiking with us now. She's a bartender from Hawaii, who I later learned traveled to France for the Tour de France as well as is planning to go to France after she summits Katahdin. You never know who you're really talking to cuz everybody's on a level playing field here on the trail. She's been living in Hawaii for 12 years but seems to get around the globe pretty comfortably. She's a steady hiker and is a welcome addition to our group. We get up to the Mount Washington Summit around 7 a.m. It's clear as a bell for about 10 minutes and then the clouds roll in and it's cold and damp on the summit. We take some great summit photos, check out the Cog Rail train station and Stone House with stone walls maybe 6 or 8 feet thick. Once the clouds come in so strong there's not much to do on Mount Washington so we head out on the Gulfside Trail. We quickly walk below the cloud cover. There are great views in every direction. So the trail goes along the Cog rail. We really would like to see this cog train up close and personal. It is not to be. I do find coal along the trail from the Cog train. One run a day uses coal to generate Steam for power just like they used to. When they do use coal it spits out so much black smoke, it's an environmental nightmare. For some reason coal gets thrown out of the train as well. So they only do it once a day. We see three mountains and r wondering if they r the mountains were going to climb today. It's a beautiful sunny day and we hang out and take a couple breaks on a hike. One of the mountains is Mount Clay and then Mount Jefferson. After a fierce rock climb scramble we go by Mount Adams. Now just like the hike up was a tough 11 miles, today's hike is a 10.3 miles and it's all rock. Today we're hiking on big rocks, little rocks, lots of rocks, whole rocks fields, and sometimes the only thing you can see is rocks. We talked about how it's total focus every time you put your foot down so you don't take a tumble. There's a few slips and a few ouchs. It's very, very hard on your feet, and on your concentration. If you want to enjoy the view you try and stand still because otherwise you're going to get hurt. We're really hiking slower and it is more enjoyable. We are now in the Whites and this is nothing to rush through. So we take multiple little snack breaks because we know we have to keep eating to keep calories burning. We finally get to the Mount Madison Hut. It seems to take forever. We talked to one hiker who says yesterday one of their group fell and face-planted into the granite. The feller says he's trying to get the memory of what he looked like out of his head. This is a place of great beauty and opportunity. A misstep can be a tragic mistake. We take an hour or so at the Madison Hut. Our food plan is pretty good and we're really limiting the amount of food we are carrying. I have 1/8 of a stick of butter, half a pound of cheese on some Darn Good Bread. I stretch out on a wooden bench and take a nap. We're seeing a lot more day hikers and section hikers here in the Whites. It's really a hiking culture here. A woman gives us a four pack of different kinds of cookies and we each get a pack of cookies. We head up Mount Madison which is a steep all rocky ascent. You follow the carins as best you can but any way up is still up. It's only half a mile and it doesn't take that long. We hang out on top for about an hour. It's a very bright, piercing, burning sun today. We're really not used to that because we're not above tree line that often. We meet a number of other hikers up on the summit. I share a bunch of shuttle lists and we all talk to Wild Life, a southbound female hiker, about the trail ahead. It feels good to share information, to help somebody else's hike. After an hour, PT says let's roll on. We start the descent from Mount Madison. It's a full total rocky scramble. The sun is burning hot and we now know we're getting sunburned. The wind picks up to such an extent that it literally causes you to lose your balance. It's an added stressor to a very difficult downhill decent. There are multiple false peaks on the way down. What I mean is, you think you're going to stop going so severely, steeply downhill when you get to the next edge that you can see. Each time it just drops off again super steep. We each really take our own trail down. You read where you think your feet will go safely and follow your safe path. We finally make it into the tree line. The trail is very narrow and still very steep. Everyone is getting very tired. We've only gone 10 miles but it feels like 20. We finally get to Osgood tent site. There's only space for Thumper's tent and my tent. PT decides to hike on to find a stealth site. We agree to be on the trail by 6 to give us 4 hours to go 5 miles to our extraction point where Trail Angel, Kathy is going to pick us up at 10. I don't get to sleep until 8 p.m. Up past hiker midnight again.","Lake of the clouds

Up at 4:30 ready to hike at 5:30. Walk over to where Thumper's tent is. She is ready to go as well. So quarter of 6, we head out looking for PT. We pass one stealth site, somebody else is in it. We hiked for 15 minutes and I'm starting to worry we may not connect. The good news is we have a predetermined meeting place at our extraction point at 10 a.m. If we don't find PT, we'll just go to the extraction point. We come across PT sitting out by trail signs trying to figure out which way to go. He didn't see the AT which was on the back of the trail sign. He camped on the Saco River. It was a very nice stealth spot. A couple from Switzerland camped there as well. It's a nice gentle hike 4.5 miles down to Pinkham Notch. We arrived at 10 of 9. There's the all you can eat buffet as long as you pay before 9. So we jump in and load up our plates and start to eat. I'm stunned when I go back to get seconds because they have put away all the food. They didn't say we put away all the food at 9 a.m. You have to get it all on your plate before 9 a.m. So I spontaneously emote displeasure. Some fellow who appears is some kind of Boss. He says go through this door into the kitchen, get yourself a plate and load up, there's more food in there. So I end up having quite a good, massive breakfast. I go to the men's room to take off my knee braces. I hear Kathy talkin to the couple from Switzerland. She says ""I'm out here to pick up three hikers."" I immediately go over and introduce myself to Kathy the Trail Angel here to pick us up. We didn't know what she looked like she didn't know what we looked like. God put this little connection together. lt's good for all of us. So we ride for an hour up to South Paris, Maine. I nod in and out of sleep as we ride. Kathy is very happy and excited to be helping out through hikers. There's many ways to experience the trail. One of the ways is to be a support person, a Trail Angel for those on the trail. It's a very nice service and experience for all involved. We get to Kathy's home and meet her husband, Gerry who's just about to get in the car and drive 4 hours to pick up Durwood who summited Mount Katahdin yesterday. I don't realize it but he's also picking up Hot Sauce and ZoomZoom, who I hiked with earlier on the trail. So I get to sit on the recliner and fall asleep again. I doze in and out. At some point Ibex puts a blanket over me. My arms did catch some sunburn and as long as I keep out of the sun I'm okay. I sleep for a couple hours in the recliner. When I finally come to, so to speak, it's like 1 in the afternoon. I hang out talkin to Kathy and enjoying the day inside. When Gary gets back with the three thru-hikers it's quite a reunion. PT hiked with Durwood for 1800 miles. Hot Sauce and Zoom Zoom are excited to see me as well. We come in and have a big dinner. We then sit around the living room talking about what's to come ahead on the trail. By 9 I'm all done. Three days over Mount Washington took a lot out of me. When you're hiking you just keep a hard edge to keep going. It's only when you get on a zero, do you realize how tired you are. Gary and Kathy got involved as Trail Angels on the AT after their son, Russell passed away 6 years ago. Gary had done a lot of hiking with Russell and this is just a way that he can stay connected. We make a lot of emotional connections in the process of the evening. Hiking the trail is almost a cathartic, emotional release on many levels for many people. Everybody has things to process and emotionally resolve in their life. Question is when you take time to do that.","

The highlight of the day is going over the next five days of the trail with Gary. He's done a lot of hiking in these parts and is very familiar with the trail. He's able to give spot on information on exactly what to expect in terms of difficulty and mileage. So we develop a plan for the next five days of hiking. We will do the first two days over what's called the Wildcats. Derwood thought the Wildcats were the most challenging part of his hike. Then after the Wildcats, we will have the the Mahoosuc Notch, described as the toughest mile on the AT, followed by the Mahoosuc Arm, one of the steepest climbs on the AT, and then Old Speck Mountain, a very challenging climb. Gary says we're in for a very challenging 5 days. We plan to leave the house at 5 and be on the trail by 6 a.m. Thursday morning.

So we leave Joe Dodge Lodge at Pinkham Notch at 6 a.m. right on schedule. Right away it's a steep climb. We are going from 2000 feet to 4800 feet. It's a long, steep climb. It's challenging and there are times you're pulling yourself up with your hands and not using your trekking poles at all. There are four different identified peaks called Wildcat A, C, D and E. Where Peak B went, I don't know. The last peak after those four is North Carter Dome that has two peaks as well. Five miles in PT takes a bad fall. A momentary lapse of concentration can be a disaster. I take two falls as well. On one fall I bend up my trekking pole. My second fall I was going too fast to make the directional change that I made. I was moving up the left side of the trail and thought a better line was the right side of the trail. So I did not have my weight directly over my foot when I planted it, but rather it was reaching to the right and extended. It slipped right off that rock and I went down hard. I scraped up my shin and my elbow. I was scared when I first landed that I may have really hurt my leg. It was just a lot of pain but no serious damage. PT is walking on a four week healing fractured ankle. Every fall has the potential to end his hike. The Wildcats are up there with the absolute toughest day I've had. We are crawling, scrambling, and climbing up damp wet rocks. It had been a drought up until that long week of rain two weeks ago. When you're up in the clouds everything is always wet. As we're heading down a small decline, PT slips again, but this time gets his leg pinned underneath his full weight as he's up against a ledge. Hard to describe, but it looked like a terrible fall with a lot of pressure on that right knee. I headed back to try and help him untangle himself.The climb is really starting to wear us out. As we go over the two peaks of Carter Dome we start to think about looking for a stealth site. We were supposed to hike to the Imp campsite, but we're getting tired and would rather stealth. Also, we get better sleep stealthing than being in a crowded campsite. They also have limits as to the number of people you can have in a campsite. We surely don't want to hike there and then not be able to stay there. We come across one stealth site that would be perfect, but it already has somebody there and also is a little early. As we get to the top of North Carter Dome we find a very workable stealth site. We're just at the tree line, so the trees are ten feet tall. There are no widow-makers, which is important because it's a very windy night coming up. They're projecting up to 70 mile an hour winds during the night. So we're two miles short of our plan to get to the Imp Campsite. That's okay. We're pretty much worn out. During the night it's extremely windy and it rains. The tent is great and I'm very dry.","Joe Dodge Lodge

The two mile descent into Imp Campsite turns out to be quite the nightmare. We are hiking in the clouds. Everything is wet. There are no views and there's just a steady, palpable mist blowing across the landscape. This is a cold, wet descent on slippery, greasy rocks. Everybody's a little beat up from falling the day before. We are moving slowly. I take to calling us nobo slobos. That's Northbound slow hikers. We all think and laugh cuz that does describe us. It's a very difficult descent. Did I say that already? Even Ibex takes a bad fall. We are blessed not to be trying this challenging descent at the end of yesterday. We always like to start out with the toughest climb first thing in the morning. As God would have it, we are starting out with the toughest part of the day as a descent, which is what we needed. Not our plan, but plans are made to be adjusted. After Imp, we have a tough climb up Mount Moriah. It's only about a thousand foot climb, but it's very tough. Then we start a five and a half mile descent down to Gorham, New Hampshire. The hike down off of Moriah levels out. It becomes a nice hike out. Refreshing after such a challenging two days. We get down around two. Gary and Cathy are planning to pick us up around three. We eat, stretch and take naps while waiting. We get picked up and it's nice to go back to the house after such a challenging two days. We get to shower and chill out a little. Part of the hiking challenge is all the chores you do every night just to get ready to go to sleep. You set up the tent, you draw your water, you filter your water, you pour your water into something you're going to drink it out of. Then you eat a rather bland, boring meal of cheese, bars, and other boring food. Then you stretch, blow up your flash sleeping pad. Then maybe you're ready to lay down and stop for the day. It's different when you're in a house with indoor plumbing. It's really a much simpler process. So we try to get to bed because we're going to be up early the next day to do it again.","

We are back hiking on the trail at 6 a.m. Gary has done a great job knowing where to drop us and how long it's going to take to get us there. It's really nice to have this kind of support, particularly at the end of this challenging journey. The mental aspect is really the biggest part of the challenge. You have to make it through. You have to do all the miles. Really though, you have to keep your head in the game. The night before I'd been thanking Gary and explaining that I have been on the trail for better than 6 months to get to this end of this journey. It's a journey I chose, but it does wear on you. There are so many physical challenges, and there are times you'd just like to get back to that simple life at home. The question is, are you going to finish what you started or are you going to quit halfway across the stream? You never feel good if you don't get to the other side. You also end up getting swept away to someplace you weren't prepared to go. They say this year only 12% of those who started will finish the trail, because of the severe weather challenges. They say that this has been the most challenging weather year in the history of the trail. So I was saying to Gary how nice it was to have this kind of support in the last 300 miles. It's the last 15% of the journey. Most of the northbounders you see have a hollowed-out, we're-beaten-down look. Everybody says they're ready to be finished. This is a lot tougher journey than I imagined. You want to finish, but it's a tough finish. Flannel sheets, a refrigerator, and indoor plumbing are very attractive. Instead, this morning we are heading up toward Mount Hayes. We're going from 780 feet up to 2,555 feet. That's a long climb. The good news is we're doing it over four miles. As we continue our day we do not feel as hammered or challenged. We get to the Gentian Pond Campsite ahead of schedule. Ibex came across a site on her women AT hiker Facebook page. It listed stealth sites in the Whites. She says that there's a good stealth site about a mile and a half past the Gentian Pond campsite. This would save us a total of four tenths of a mile in and out of the campsite. If we just hike and stealth, we skip that in and out. So we're feeling very good when suddenly the next two climbs after the Gentian Pond campsite are very challenging. It's only a mile and a half, but suddenly we are hammered. We do find the stealth site, as predicted, and make our camp there for the night. Your feelings can swing dramatically on the trail. Sometimes it seems like you just run out of gas without seeing it coming at all. That may be why I like to try and get done by three or four and be asleep by seven, hiker midnight.","

So up and on the trail by five. We're heading for the Full Goose Shelter. It's more of the up and down, steady climbing. It's a foggy morning. After five miles we get to that final state, MAINE at mile 1908, the Maine - New Hampshire border. We take a break, eat, and take pictures. We are finally in the state of Maine. We have. hiked from Georgia to Maine. Another 281 miles and we will finish the AT. We're pretty excited. I hiked with PT for 5 or 6 weeks in the beginning. Now I'm hiking with PT again towards the end. Mount Katahdin actually seems like a possibility. Completing 2,200 miles was too big of a thought and challenge for me to really embrace. I just hiked a day hike each day that took me North. We are actually becoming thru hikers. A thru hiker is someone who does the entire Trail in one calendar year. It's way harder than that it sounds. The day is a series of up and down. There is no flat, there is no steady. You're either going up or going down and there is no in between. We get to the Full Goose Shelter by 12:30. It was eight miles and it took seven hours. Earlier on the trail I used to travel 2 to 3 miles an hour. There were times I would crank 4 miles an hour for 2 or 3 hours. Regularly, I would have 10 miles done by 9 a.m. in the morning. We now feel good that we're doing better than a mile per hour. We draw water, eat a big lunch, and all take naps. Another Northbounder comes in named Gazelle. She talks about taking a month off just for her mental health. She says she just lost her hiking partner. She'd hiked with him for a full month. He was getting off the trail to go see his girlfriend. Now she was hiking alone. It's different when you're hiking alone up in these mountains. It's also not as safe to be hiking alone. We make the decision to hike through Mahoosuc Notch, the toughest, hardest mile on the Appalachian Trail. We first have to hike an hour down to the Notch. We start the Notch at 3:20. You hear lots of stories and tales about hiking the Mahoosuc Notch. As we start through the Notch it is incredibly hard. Derwood said go low when in doubt. We really have to find our own trail through. It's marked in sections but it is a huge jumble of giant boulders. There are spots where you can fall 30 feet down in between the boulders you're standing over. So you're making some big steps and taking some big risks We were moving slowly, cautiously, and I'd like to say intelligently. I heard the story of a girl who broke her leg in the Mahoosuc Notch. There's no cell service. It was ten very painful, tough hours trying to get out of the notch on a broken leg to get medical help. I was not going to rush anything and put myself at risk or anybody else at risk. So far on the trail with every group I've been with, I've been the lead hiker. I set the pace. I pick the line of the trail. Everyone else can make it whatever speed they want and whatever line of trail they want to hike. Typically we all stay together and stay pretty close on the same line. There would be times in the Mahoosuc Notch I would come to a dead end. I would have ended up leading up to a cliff. Then PT or Ibex would branch out and find a way. Four or five times we had to take off our packs and crawl down under rocks and huge boulders to get to the other side. We then form a chain and pass the packs and trekking poles through. This was a lot of reaching, stretching and pulling to move forward. You had to take some big high steps and really put a lot of pressure on your knees. You also had to pull yourself up or slide down on your butt to get to the next rock and move forward. We thought we were probably halfway through Mahoosuc Notch when we checked Guthooks. It said we'd gone two tenths of a mile. There was a thousand foot rock wall on either side of us straight up. This Notch was about 30 feet wide and a mile long. You could hear water running and at times see water running. You would go through hot and cold sections where the temperature varied 20 degrees in a space of 10 feet. This was a very unique section of trail. We felt very good about taking this challenge on at the end of the day. We weren't really using our typical hiking muscles to make progress. We were moving very slowly with a lot of hard pulling or hard pushing up with our legs, very different than hiking. It ended up taking two hours and 40 minutes to go one mile. We got out at six p.m. . There was a large stealth area with room for 10 tents with lots of shrubbery in between. We said good enough and set up the stealth. Five other northbounders came through the Notch as well and set up after us. Two other northbounders passed us while we were in the Notch. One was a Dutch fellow that was moving quite rapidly. We talked a little with Firefly, who started in March. We didn't get to sleep right away because we were a combination of tired, sore and just jazzed-up from coming through the Notch. Tomorrow, we would start our day with the Mahoosuc Arm, one of the steepest climbs on the trail. We decided to just sleep in and get up at 5. Our goal is to be on the trail by 6:30.","

We decided to sleep in and give ourselves a break in the morning. We were ahead of schedule by 4 miles, so we didn't get up until 5:30 and get hiking on the trail until 6:30 a.m. It was very good that we did sleep in cuz everyone was pretty whooped. Six-thirty is late for us. Mahoosuc Arm lived up to its billing. It was a long, tough climb. A lot of hauling yourself up and making decisions as to what is the best way to get up. A lot of long stretches of slab walking. Slab walking is walking up an angled slab of granite that may go up 50 feet, maybe a hundred yards. It's tough on your Achilles cuz you're just going up. Sometimes the pitch changes suddenly. It's much steeper than you realize. We had a couple near misses but nobody fell. A fall is when your body hits the ground. On one of the slab walks, it tricked me. It got steeper without me realizing, my feet went out but my hands hit the slab and not my body. That counts as a slip as opposed to a fall. It was a gray, misty, almost rainy day, so the rocks and roots were moist. There were no views. We came to many places where if it was a clear day you know there'd be a wonderful view. If you're hiking 2000 miles you can't always wait for a sunshiny day. After we got off the Arm we went down and started back up Old Speck Mountain. That was another big climb. There was a fire tower on top of Old Speck that we decided not to hike to because of the foggy day. Then there was a nice, more gradual five miles down to Grafton Notch. When we got down to the parking lot, Kathy was waiting with drinks and treats. We were all pretty done in. On the way back to Gary and Kathy's we stopped at an outfitters. This wasn't a huge outfitter, but they had some of everything. I compared the tread on my Merrell boots. Compared to a new pair of boots, I had no tread at all. So I bought a new pair of boots. I looked at the trekking poles because I had bent mine up on one of my falls. It had cushioned my fall at the price of bending. They didn't have what I wanted in trekking poles. They didn't have pants either. The snap on my pants just fell off. The owner of the store told me that they fix trekking poles. So I got my trekking poles and he mixed and matched and came up with a solution. So now one pole is shorter than the other. It would come to pass that I would be very aware that I had one pole 2 inches shorter than the other. When we got back to the house, everybody showered and fell asleep. Later Gary and Kathy bought pizzas and we had a pizza feast. We are now at mile 1922.6. We have 267 miles to go. After dinner around the table we developed a plan for those 267 miles. If we are able to follow the plan or some close facsimile to it, we should summit on Monday, September 3rd. That would be good because I'd like to be home for the first Eagles game on September 6th.","
