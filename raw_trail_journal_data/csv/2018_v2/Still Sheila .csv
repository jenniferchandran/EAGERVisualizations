Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584558,"This blog post was first published January 7th on https://thetrek.coSouthern Ontario, Canada. It is cold.  VERY cold.  I am staring out the window at snow and ice.  Under my finger tips I feel the frosty pane that is insufficient at blocking the frigid air.  With the wind chill, it is -27 Celsius ( -16.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Way too cold for hiking!!
I read somewhere that the shuttle drivers who take people up to the parking lot at Springer Mountain are pretty good at sizing people up, and pre-determining if they will fail or succeed on their thru- attempt of the AT. I think that if I were “sized up”, I would not fall into the category of “likely to succeed”.   For one, I’m not the youngest doe on the trail.  If you listened closely, you’d hear my 46 year old (going on 80) knees crackling like a campfire as they lift me up off the couch.   I’m also not the fittest.  Truth be told, I’ve got an unsightly “ponch”.  Not to be confused with a certain 1970’s handsome highway patrolman, a “ponch” is a flab pack specifically found on a girl (according to the urban dictionary).  I would like to blame it on giving birth to twins, but that excuse fizzled into fiction a long time ago.  What I can blame it on is; my sedentary job, the bowl of frozen yogurt that I just consumed, and the current state of the weather. Yes, I realize that those are poor excuses too, but I’m using them. Finally, my gear kind of sucks.  Well, some of it does anyway. That is a work in progress which I will write about a bit later.
So, did you just hitch a ride with an AT blogger who is going to fail? Don’t size me up so quickly. What my crackling knees, girl “ponch” and inadequate gear don’t show you is; my stubbornness, my adaptability, my strength and my experience.
I won’t bore you with my entire life history, but if you were to take a quick peek at my recent past, this is what you would see.  My husband retired and I closed my business. We gave away or sold almost half of our possessions, purchased an RV and spent almost a year traveling all over the US and Canada while homeschooling our boys.  We experienced a lot of changes, a lot of obstacles and a few difficulties, but we adapted.
During that time, I discovered that my second born (aka: twin B) and I love hiking together. And hike we did!  We hiked the mountains in Big Bend NP, the desert in Joshua Tree NP, and the Grand Canyon.  We fell in love with giant Redwood Trees and Sequoias as we hiked around California. The snow capped mountains in Glacier NP (Canada) and in Banff NP tested us.  But, the hike that really hooked us, the one that turned this enjoyable pastime into what I hope will be a lifelong addiction, was a seven day hike on The West Coast Trail on Vancouver Island. Wow.  That is the only word to describe it.  Look it up.

We are now back home.  After being on the move for a year, staying in one place seems unnatural.  And boring.  So what does an adventurous and determined girl do?   She dreams bigger than she has dreamed before.  She plans.  Then, she does.  Oh, and she brings along her handsome and courageous thirteen year old son to be her hiking buddy.  He has been reading over my shoulder as I type, and has decided that he likes that description of himself. So, I’ll stick with it.
 
Now, back to the window.  I need to get out there and strengthen these crackly knees.  Not only do I need to lighten my pack, but I also need to lighten my load (translation: reduce the “ponch”).  I need to test my gear and evaluate what needs to be upgraded.  I’m running out of time, and I don’t see any warm weather in sight. Leg strengthening exercise, and repeatedly climbing one flight of stairs, will only get me so far.  I need to get out there.  We both need to get out there, whether the weather cooperates or not.  But for now, the frosty pane tickles my finger tips and I continue to dream and plan, while I wait to do.",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sun",0

Stress.
A warm bed.
A pet.
A spouse.
Material stuff
Everybody who hits the trails for an extended period of time has to make the decision to leave certain things and people behind.   Leaving these things behind may be precisely the reason for hitting the trail, or maybe having to leave them behind is a struggle and a source of doubt, guilt or uncertainty.
What I Am Leaving Behind
I am no exception. There is one person who I struggle over leaving behind.  He is Twin A, my firstborn, my 13-year-old charming and witty redhead whose stubbornness and quick temper are adequately suited to the color of his hair. His brother, Twin B, loves to hike and will be my companion on the AT this spring.  Twin A is not a hiker.
Having twins is a challenge, especially when they react together like oil and water (despite loving each other to death). Time apart may be just what they both need to aid their independence.  For this reason, I am looking forward to finding out how they both mature and grow while they are apart. However, as a mother, leaving one child behind for five months is difficult. It causes me a small measure of guilt, and at times it makes me uncertain.   Not only is he going to be away from his mother, but I am taking his best friend and closest companion away from him too.

 The Whole Picture
Long-distance hiking is a test of mental fortitude. If you only watch the bloggers and vloggers who show you the inspirational views, the blissful moments and the triumphant finish at the top of Katahdin, you’ll miss out on half of the story.   When they reveal their aches and their pains, and you can see that their throbbing muscles and exhausted feet are wresting against their determination to endure, then you will have seen more of the truth.  But it isn’t until they divulge that inner tug of war, those people or things that are both pulling them from the trail and pushing them toward it, that you will see the complete picture and know how truly difficult it is to both reach Katahdin and return from it.
Self-Reflection
Does leaving a child behind increase my chances of thru-hike failure?  Or worse, does it make me selfish and a bad mother?  I suppose there will be a wide variety of opinions on those two questions.  The best answer I can muster up is, “I sure hope not!”  However, what I do know for certain is this: My boys watch their mother just as I watch them.  As a family, we celebrate all of our individual and corporate successes and mourn all of our individual and corporate failures, together.  I have a strong desire for my sons to see me succeed and to celebrate with me.  This is what will carry me to Katahdin.
What About You?
Are you headed out on a long hike this year?  If so, what will be tugging at you from home, testing your mental resolve?  What is going to help you overcome this internal struggle and get through the next 100 miles…. and the next?",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Mon",0

Bubbles of 2018 thru-hiker hopefuls have begun their long pilgrimage north.  Some have already fallen to the wayside, while others press on through cold and wet wintry conditions.  Meanwhile, Cole and I are watching with excitement and anxious anticipation, waiting for our departure date to arrive.  We have not been idle.  Most of our gear from last year’s hiking season has been revised and upgraded to lighter alternatives. We have been listening and learning as much as we can from seasoned long-distance hikers.  Most importantly, we have been hiking.
Thru-Hikers in Training
The mercury has risen (slightly), giving us a much-needed motivational boost to get out there and tackle some local trails.  Added to this is a nervous restlessness growing inside of me that will only be dissipated through movement.  So we hike.  Four days per week, starting at 7.5 miles and zero pack weight, we have slowly increased our distance to 12.5 miles and our pack weight to 20 pounds.  This still falls eight pounds short of what we expect our final pack weight to be.

Hiking our local trails in southern Ontario.
There are no mountains to climb in southern Ontario, but we do live on an escarpment with numerous stair access points. So we’ve been hauling our backpacks up and down 1,500 stairs on each outing.

Hauling our packs up and down steps, 1,500 at a time.
The Difference Between Us
These steps and miles have opened my eyes to a few things.  First, Cole hikes a lot faster this year than he did last year.  The four inches that he has grown could be to blame.  Or perhaps with age I have gotten slower.  Regardless of the why and how, there is now a huge gap between his speed and mine. When we hike locally, we usually end up splitting up.  However, on the AT he might need to learn patience and throttle his Ferrari engine back to my putt-putt pace.  He is only 13 after all, and too young to be hiking the backcountry without his mom close at hand.  So say I, his mom.  (Or maybe this mom needs to let up a bit and give him some space!  Ugh!  Parenting!)
 

One of our local trails, the Bruce Trail, is marked with white blazes.
 The Trail Will Complete Our Training
With each outing we are toughening up and getting stronger.  Despite this, when we hit the mountains in Georgia I am certain it will feel like we have not done any training at all. Our plan is to start slowly and let the trail complete the conditioning we have started.  It’s a good plan.  I like to plan.  But has it been enough?  Uh-oh. Here comes that nervous restlessness welling up again.  I guess I’d better get back to the trails.  We’ll see you in Georgia very soon.",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Mon",0
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585025,"I woke up very early in the morning in the hotel. I was excited and nervous. Once the fam jam was up and fed,we headed for the parking lot on Springer. 
The road was very narrow ,full of deep potholes , and in many places there was a steep drop off on one side of the road. At one point we had to pass a vehicle coming in the opposite direction and I was certain we were going over the edge. Of course, we didn’t and we made it up to Springer just fine. We left our backpacks in the van and hiked 1 mile south to the start of the Appalachian Trail. We completely forgot to sign the trail book. Then we returned to the van. My husband hiked the one mile there and back with us, but Cole’s twin brother Evan, who dislikes hiking, waited for us to return. 
Once back at the van, we loaded our gear onto our backs and said some teary goodbyes. Then Cole and I were off on our adventure! It was a cool day and we spent most of it in the fog. The trail was beautiful and shrouded in fog it became mysterious too. There were a few ups and downs but nothing strenuous. With our layers on we were comfortably warm. Our spirits were very high. We thought we would have to dig our first cat hole just a couple of miles in, but just happened upon the privy at Stover Creek just in time. It was only noon but someone was already hunkered down at the shelter there for the day. 
When  we arrived at Hawk Mountain Shelter there was still room on the bottom floor. Since freezing rain was in the forecast we decided to stay in the shelter instead of the tent. It was a good opportunity to meet other hikers. A bottle of whisky made an appearance, but we declined. Now that is a heavy luxury item!
Cole said that he had a great day. I did too. No aches pains or blisters. Yet.","Springer mountain
",Hawk Mountain Shelter,"Mar 25, Sun",8.10
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585161,"Last night we stayed in the shelter at Hawk Mountain. Rain was predicted in the forecast so we thought the shelter was a better alternative to the tent. It was bitterly cold and windy. Wide gaps in the shelter floor allowed access to the wind and I spent the night with a breeze coming up from under me. Even though I knew my sleep system was warm enough, I had a chill that just would not go away. Cole was toasty warm in his 10° quilt and Tyvek sleeve. He wasn’t even using his liner. To the touch my skin was warm but I just Couldn’t stop shivering. After a while I got out of bed and went for a walk to the privy. By the time I return to bed I had warmed up. The wind howled all night and drowned out any sounds of snoring from my fellow shelter mates. Much to my relief there were no mice sightings, nor even the sounds of scurring little feet. I didn’t get very much sleep. Cole says I was snoring so I must have had at least a little sleep. In the morning the wind continued to howl. We cooked oatmeal with raisins and made hot chocolate for breakfast. We layered ourselves up and got moving sometime around 9.  We were constantly removing layers and putting them back on throughout the day. It was sunny  and bright and our spirits were high.  We had a huge climb up Sasafrass mountain. When we came back down the mountain, there was trail magic waiting for us in the form of cold soda.  What a wonderful energy boost! On and off throughout the day we passed by and chatted with some of the fellows we had shared the shelter with. In the early afternoon we arrived at Gooch mountain shelter and set up the tent. It is a tiny two man and we are a bit crouded.  We cooked potatoes with bacon for dinner and had a lot of laughs with some of the other hikers. Apparently there is a fellow out on the trail with over 100 pounds of gear and a wheeled cart. There were a lot of jokes going around over that. Cole was laughing so hard that he spit up his hot chocolate.","Hawk Mountain Shelter
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 26, Mon",7.60
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585268,"I was warm and toasty in the tent last night. Our tent is small and although we slept well, trying to maneuver around each other in the morning as we packed up was not pretty. It took us so long to get ready that I am embarrassed to say.  It was a bit warmer for hiking but multiple layers were still required. We had some gorgeous views up on preacher rock. Cole hikes so much faster than I do and his confidence is building. I let him hike ahead for half an hour then he has to wait up for me. At one pretty spot when I arrived he had the footprint all spread out for us to have a picnic lunch. If it had been warmer I may have napped. There are so many hikers on the trail. When we reached Lance creek it was packed. As we were trying to figure out what to do, a hiker came over and said that he knew of a spot that nobody had spied yet. I was so grateful that I hugged him.  I have a pain on the outside of my right foot that I have never had before. I was so tired too and feeling dehydrated. One litre of water is what I have been drinking a day. I need to drink more. There is no privy at Lance creek and no leaves on the trees, so doing your business means walking back up the trail away from camp to find privacy. Ugh! Not what my feet wanted to do. After dinner Cole hung around a group of hikers chatting by the campfire. I napped. The ground below our tent is on a slope so I spent most of the night rolling into Cole’s space. Still, I am happy we got a spot and didn’t have to move on. It was another toasty night under the covers. I am happy for our warm gear.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Lance Creek,"Mar 27, Tue",8.20
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585541,"By morning, my feet were feeling much better and my headache had gone away. Around 630 I began packing my things and got myself dressed while Cole remained tucked away under his covers. Once I was finished, I got out of the tent and Cole was able to get dressed and pack up with more room to maneuver. I seem to have more tolerance for tight spaces than he does and this method of packing up was much less aggravating to him. We gobbled up some pop tarts and downed some electrolytes for breakfast and then we headed up the trail. Or should I say up up up the trail. It seemed like we were doing nothing but climbing. It was misty and cool but with all the exertion I soon had to remove all of my layers except for my T-shirt. 
I knew that we would be going by two shelters during today and I asked Cole to wait for me at the first shelter. Foolishly I had not checked my guide book before I made this request, and I did not realize that the first shelter was .4 miles up a blue blazed trail. Noticing the sign for the shelter, Cole headed down the blue blazed trail. Thankfully he turned back when he could not quickly see shelter.
 He is becoming well known in our little bubble of  hikers. I am constantly hearing things like “your son just flew by me” and “Boy your son is fast” and even “ I was trying to keep up with your son but just couldn’t”.  
We continued on our method of having him hike ahead for 30 minutes and then waiting for me to catch up. As I hauled myself up blood mountain, my speed, such as it is, diminished greatly. Sleet was coming down and the only thing keeping me warm in my T-shirt was movement. I began worrying about Cole and imagined him sitting somewhere shivering as he waited for me to catch up. When I finally reached him it was at the top of Blood Mountain. He was sitting comfortably inside the shelter on a borrowed  cushioned seat. Whatsittoya  had given him some pepperoni to eat and a lady had given him two granola bars.  All that worrying I was doing and here he was warm , comfortable and being fed. We sat there at the top of Blood Mountain and ate the last of our food. About 15 other hikers were there doing the same thing, celebrating the successful summit of the most difficult mountain in the Georgia section of the AT. There was no view to behold from that majestic peak, just fog. However, there was a privy and that is always a welcome sight. 
Heading down Blood Mountain required less exertion, but it was steep, rocky, wet and muddy. Not a good combination. As I picked my way down the mountain, being cautious of every placed step, a day hiker approached me from behind. I moved aside to let him pass but he declined and said that if I didn’t mind, he would like to walk with me for a bit. It was odd at first. Perhaps he thought that I looked unsteady. He asked me lots of questions about my thru hike and it was actually nice to have someone to chat with. I did actually lose my balance at one point, but my poles, and God’s grace kept me upright. After quite some time my hiking buddy met up with some other day hikers and they all continued down the trail ahead of me. It wasn’t much long after that when the trail brought me to the bottom of Blood Mountain. I had concurred the beast! An outfitter, Mountain Crossings, sits there at Neels Gap waiting for tired hikers who need to resupply. Cole was there with at least 40 other tired, smelly hikers, milling around at the picnic tables, shopping in the store and scarfing down hot pizza. I had promised Cole a pizza too, so we ordered one and gobbled it up. I also picked up our resupply  box and purchased a few items in the store.  
Emergency crews arrived and we learned from other hikers that an older gentleman had fallen coming down Blood Mountain. We think it was someone in our bubble but we are not certain who. ( I found out later that is was Bampa. We started from Springer at the same time. You can read his journal on this site.)  Many people from our bubble are spending the night at Neels Gap. Whatsittoya, Maine Mike, Dunk and Egg ( hikers in our bubble) are all taking a zero. Cole liked chatting with them and is a little disappointed, but we are sure to run into them again down the trail. 
Eventually we continued on one more mile to Bull Creek. Only one other hiker was there. Two more arrived before bedtime. We had to hang our food in a tree for the first time. At all of our previous stops there have been bear boxes or cables to hang. It took us quite a while to get our food up into the tree, but eventually we concurred that task too. It was a nice warm, although windy evening.","Lance Creek
",Bull Gap,"Mar 28, Wed",8.30
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585542,"I did not get a lot of sleep last night. I was warm and comfortable, but just not able to sleep. One of the hikers at the campsite told us there was a bear in the area. I kept wondering if we had hung the food well. It was all still swinging from the tree in the morning though. I picked up extra oatmeal at Neels Gap to add to our Resupply. Two packets each has not been enough to satisfy. This morning we had three packets each. Cole still wanted more. We also split a fat cinnamon bun. Keeping this growing young man’s belly full might prove to be difficult. 
As we headed out to tackle the trail we were greeted with more wet mist and drizzle. There were many viewpoints marked in the guidebook  but each time we reached one our only view was thick white clouds. Around lunch time we stopped at one such view point to eat. However, before we pulled out the chow we decided that the spot was too windy and cold for picnicking. As we geared back up clouds suddenly parted revealing a majestic view of the mountains. We gaped in awe and gave thanks for the precious gift of creation’s beauty. Eventually we moved on to find a place to eat. 
When we were about four miles from camp, I told Cole he could go on ahead straight to Low Gap without stopping to wait for me. I was so tired that those four miles seemed to be a hundred and they took me forever. He made it to camp an hour before I did and he set up the tent. However, he set it up about ten feet from a roaring fire. He was none too impressed with me when I insisted that it had to be moved. 
In the evening we had a heavy downpour. I was just crawling into the tent when it hit. I quickly tried to get the fly zipped up but the zipper got caught. I held the fly flap together trying to keep the rain out while Cole worked on the zipper trying to get it unstuck. We ended up yanking from the ground the peg holding that part of the fly. This just made matters worse. Eventually we got the zipper up and the peg very poorly put back into the ground. Our fly was no longer taunt. Nobody wanted to go out and fix it. We were wet and some of our gear was too. We crawled into our beds, closed our eyes and prayed for a dryish night.","Bull Gap
",Low Gap Shelter,"Mar 29, Thu",10.40
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585544,"In the morning the tent was soaking wet. Our quilts were just a bit damp in a few places. It was really a really gross feeling changing into damp clothes and packing up a wet tent. Everyone in camp was dealing with the same thing and somehow we were all doing it with smiles. We took a long time to get going, lingering around the fire and trying to get rid of the damp sensation. When we got moving it was cool and windy, but every so often the sun graced us with its presence. It was up a mountain, down to a Gap, up a mountain, down to a Gap all day long. The trail was very rocky in many places today. With the clear skys came many views of the mountain ranges and I rejoiced in every single one. On the way down the mountain to Unicoi Gap, a day hiker heading up the trail welcomed me to the area, but then added that he was sorry there was no trail magic waiting for me. I thought to myself, that is ok, I would rather have blessings than magic and today I have received many of those. I was very tired and sore when I arrived at The Cheese Factory. There was no factory and no cheese, but Cole was already there and some nice ladies were already mothering him and helping him to hang the tent in the trees to dry it out. A warm fire was blazing. I chatted with the ladies and we laughed at silly things, like our excitement over finding a privy on top of Blood Mountain and how your knees touch the door when you use it. We laughed and chatted about pee rags too!! Ah, girl talk is fun, even for old ladies like me.We had instant potatoes and a package of bacon pieces for dinner. I only meant to add half the bacon but....oops. Our food is almost gone again. I need to get larger portions next time. This backing business makes one hungry! It was a cold cold night. I was warm but had on everything except my hiking clothes. When I wear all of my clothes to bed, I have not much left to use as a pillow. I still am not sure I want the added weight of one though, no matter how little it weighs. I’d rather carry more food. I slept well!","Low Gap
",Cheese Factory Site,"Mar 30, Fri",13.40
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585546,"It was very cold outside when we woke up, but we did not feel the need to rush so we stayed in bed longer. The sun was shining and as the temperature creeped above freezing we unenthusiastically crawled from our covers. As with every other day on the AT, once we got ourselves hiking, we warmed right up.
I had taken stock of our food supply and had given Cole options. Option one: eat two wraps for lunch and have no food the next day until the shuttle picks us up at 11:15 and takes us to Hiawassee, or option two: eat one wrap for lunch and one for breakfast the next day. He chose option two. 
I was hiking along worrying about it and feeling pretty bad that I hadn’t brought enough food. I prayed about it too because that is just what I do when I worry. Soon  I encountered a Boy Scout troop headed towards me on the trail. I moved to the side so that they could get by and one of the leaders said “Hey, there is trail magic in the Gap, but sorry, there are no bananas left.” Well, I high tailed it down to the Gap as fast as my slow legs could take me. I scarfed down a tangerine all the while eyeing the food laid out on the table and wondering how much would be polite to take. I pocketed a snickers bar and a pack of pop tarts thinking that in the very least I had breakfast for Cole in the morning. I didn’t know that when he had passed by earlier he had also pocketed the exact same thing. I thanked the gentleman, chatted a bit, then thanked him again before moving on with a little more bounce in my step. 
Near the half way point to our destination, we sat to have lunch. Cole happily ate three wraps, his original one and the two that would have been our breakfast the next day had we not found trail magic. He was full and happy. We were able to FaceTime my husband Mark.
It was sunny and cheery the rest of the day, but my feet and legs were getting pretty sore. I had sent Cole on ahead to Deep Gap Shelter. When I reached the blue blaze and Guthooks told me I had .4 of a mile to go, I was regretting sending Cole ahead. At that point I would have preferred to move down the trail a bit and set up the tent, rather than head down a blue blaze and backtrack in the morning. But, follow the blue blaze I did. 
It was not as cold as it had been the night before, but I did not sleep well. It is catching up with me.","Cheese Factory Site
",Deep Gap,"Mar 31, Sat",9.40
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585615," We had to be to Dick’s Creek by 11:15 to get the shuttle in to Hiawassee, so we set an alarm for 6am. Still, we didn’t move our sorry butts until 6:30. I knew that Cole could fly to Dick’s Creek in a flash, but with my sore feet I have been moving slower and slower. It would have only been 3.6 miles, but that blue blaze brought it to 4. This is called a “Nero”. A “zero” is a day you rest instead of hike. A “Nero” aka “near zero” is a day that you don’t hike very far.
As I hiked along I reminisced about living a life with bad feet. When I was a little girl, I remember waking up in the middle of the night with pain in my feet and legs. I would go and get my running shoes that had my orthotics in them and I would put them on before crawling back into bed. I knew they were supposed to help with the pain, I just didn’t know they didn’t work that way. Now I know better, and I knew that what I needed was rest!!!
I came across a small waterfall with a tiny bench in front of it. A bench!! Well, of course I had to sit! A wood engraved sign identified it as Cairn’s Cascade. I could have stayed for a long time, but what is always on my mind is that Cole is waiting up ahead. I moved on. 
The Gap was only .4 of a mile ahead. We arrived around 9:40 expecting to be waiting until 11:15, but the 9:15 shuttle was still there. We hopped on and rode to the Budget Inn in Hiawassee. 
We scored some oatmeal and a mountain house meal from the hiker box ( where hikers put things they don’t want so other hikers can use them) , then we chowed down on delicious subs next door. The lady making the subs said that she always loads the hikers up on extra veggies, and she sure did.
With our bellies full, Cole retreated to the bathtub and I headed to Ingles. Our room had a fridge and microwave. Not only did I need food for our two night stay in Hiawassee, but I also needed to buy our Resupply for the trail. I quickly realized that I wouldn’t be able to carry it all. I should have waited for Cole.
I purchased enough for our stay, including heavy items like milk. As I headed back to the motel, a car pulled over and a lady leaned out. Are you headed to the Budget?
Yes I am.
Well jump on in!
Apparently the look of me screamed “hiker!!!” and these ladies enjoy helping hikers.
Once back at the Inn, I did our laundry and then had a nice long tub! I stink no more... but that won’t last long!
I had noticed a sign at Ingles that said donuts were 3 for $1 after six pm. It wasn’t hard to convince Cole to head back there with me once I promised him donuts. We filled a little cart with food for 4.5 days on the trail. I doubled the dinner portions so hopefully this young man of mine will have a full belly.
In the evening I wasted a lot of time trying to get videos uploaded to YouTube. I have been recording every day and my phone is filling up. I am not sure what I will do if I can’t get them uploaded and cleared. I would hate to lose them.I look terrible. Days of little sleep has my face looking puffy and I have big bags under my eyes. Hopefully I can catch up on some z’s.","Deep Gap

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585708,"I spent the morning trying to get photos and videos uploaded to clear some room on my phone. That failed. I spent an hour on the phone with TD Bank trying to get a security hold on my debit card lifted. Finally I had success with that. I also studied our trail guide and made plans. I decided that it would be wise to send ahead a couple of mail drops to places were Resupplying is difficult. This meant another trip to the grocery store and then the post office. 
We came across one of the ladies we had met at the cheese factory site and we chatted together as we all trekked across town to the dollar store (The grocery store was all out of spam pouches!) Her name is Jeanine. She is fun to talk to. She was on the hunt for some bright nail polish to paint her tent pegs with because they blend into the ground too easily and she has trouble finding them. She picked out a neon orange colour. If I see her again, I am going to suggest a trail name to her....Neon! 
We also came across Main Mike and Whatsittoya. They are all staying at the Budget Inn as well, but Mike and Whatsittoya came off the trail at Unicoi Gap (We came off at Dick’s Creek) so we most likely won’t see them on the trail.
Cole has been eating it up here in Hiawassee....happy hour donuts and clearance Easter cupcakes and candy for starters. Don’t worry, he’s been eating fresh fruit too!  We have too much food in the room that needs to be eaten by tomorrow because we aren’t carrying it out. I promised him a burger for dinner though so we walked all the way across town again to McDonald’s because I thought I might have better luck uploading on their wifi. Nope!

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585789,"In the morning we dropped a Resupply box off at the office( they will forward it to Franklin for us for free), dumped some items in the hikers box that we no longer needed, filled our backpacks, double checked the hotel room then hopped on the shuttle to Dicks Creek.
Of course we started out with an ascent. I felt like I had lard in my butt and lead in my boots. What I really had was a much heavier pack. This time maybe we overdid it on the food, but running out and being hungry sucked. 
I asked Cole to stick with me for the last mile because there was something exciting .1 of a mile before camp and I wanted pictures. I didn’t tell him what it was though. I wanted it to be a surprise. He wasn’t too thrilled about that. When we arrived at the Georgia/North Carolina border he was unimpressed.  He was perched on a rock with “big deal!” written all over his face. For me, it was a big deal. Every milestone is a big deal. Every mile is a big deal! Maybe not when you are young and pain free and invincible, but when you are middle aged and struggling with aches and pains, every mile is a BIG deal! So I smiled and celebrated and took pictures and enjoyed the milestone.
About a dozen tents including ours formed a mini tent city at Bly Gap. Rain and wind was expected over night so we made good and sure that our guy lines were tight before tucking ourselves in for the night.
Lightening began sometime in the middle of the night. I thought the storm would stay a distance away because initially there was no thunder. No such luck. Thunder cracked, rain poured down and the wind howled. The wind was so fierce that at times it bent the tent over far enough for the wall to touch my nose. Cole and I laid there wide awake for a couple of hours wondering if we were going to be carried off to Oz.","Dick’s Creek

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585906," It was still raining when we woke up. The weather forecast predicted it would subside by 10am. We were not in a hurry and only had planned for a shorter distance, so we stayed in the tent until there were no more sounds of raindrops kissing the tent. Our fellow camp mates were much hardier than we, so we were all but the last to leave camp. 
We had heard about NorthCarolina’s southern hospitality and were immediately greeted by the promised 700 foot climb.  Thanks for the warm welcome N.C.!
I felt like I was dragging my butt, though Cole thought I was moving faster. It was a chilly day but we did well generating our own heat climbing up and down. 
We had a shorter day, only 7.6 miles, but I was good and ready to get off my feet when I arrived at the shelter. Cole had the tent set up and I headed straight for the brand new looking privy not far off. To my disappointment, yellow caution tape blocked my way. No fancy new two seater sweet smelling privy for me. It was still under construction. Further down was a much more dilapidated one with half a wall on one side facing towards camp. Anyone coming down the hill at just the right angle would get a full on view of me with my drawers down. Nice. Maybe if I whistle or sing while I go it will keep people at a distance?? I did my business quickly and tried to be grateful that at least I wasn’t perched over a hole in the ground trying to do a balancing act.
In the sunniest and softest spot, a few of us set up our cook pots in a ring and chatted over dinner. A trail ambassador was there ( I don’t know what that title entails) and she was offering to clean feet, give foot massages and tape up hot spots (where blisters are starting to form) I knew exactly how stinky my feet were and wasn’t going to wish that on anyone. Instead, I crawled into the tent and hunkered down for a below freezing night. Cole socialized a while longer and then joined me.","Bly Gap
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Apr 04, Wed",7.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586022,"It was a beautiful morning and we got ourselves off to a relatively early start (well, for us). We couldn’t have asked for a better day to hike. It was bright, sunny and just cool enough to keep from overheating while hiking. Even the terrain was welcoming with gentle ups, easy downs and long stretches of relatively flattish ground. There were long sections of narrow trail with an embankment on one side and a steep drop off into a ravine on the other. I was navigating one of these sections and had just recently caught up to Cole. We picked our next meet up time and off he went speeding down the trail again. The distance between us quickly increased and before he disappeared from sight he turned back and yelled “be careful!” Initially I thought he was just mocking me. Whenever I send him on his way I tell him to be careful and keep an eye on the white blazes. Don’t go down any blue blazes.  I soon realized that he was not simply repeating my admonition. It was a warning. Across the trail a large tree had fallen. We had seen many trees across the trail in the past couple of days, but I could instantly tell that this one would be much more difficult to hurdle. First, the diameter was very wide, second it was a small distance off the ground, and third, it was on a very steep angle slanted down toward the ravine. I would have to climb up onto the tree and drop to the other side without sliding down the length of it into the ravine. I grumbled a bit that Cole hadn’t waited for a moment to help me over it, but then convinced myself that I would be just fine , took a breath and went for it. There was a half second of uncertainty between when my right foot left the ground on one side of the tree until the moment my left foot touched the ground on the other. Most of the danger and drama was probably in my imagination, but it was a pretty exciting crossing none the less. 
Our destination for the day was Betty Creek Gap. With about two miles remaining I gave Cole the go ahead to continue on to camp and set up the tent. 
When I arrived at the intersection of the AT and Betty Creek Trail, there were lots of camping spots...all of which were vacant. Where was Cole? There was a blue blaze to my left. He wasn’t supposed to go down blue blazes, but maybe there were campsites there. I ventured down it a ways and called his name. Nothing. I continued further down the AT and called his name. Unreasonable panic set it and yes I shed a couple of tears. Now what. I turned back and went further down the blue blaze and called his name louder and with a little more desperation in my voice. Clug clung clug comes the sound of untied boots running down the trail. There he was. What a relief. A small group of hikers from our bubble had set up camp down the Betty Creek  blue blaze trail. Guthooks didn’t show it, but the guide book did. I should have checked before I panicked.","Standing Indian Shelter
",Betty Creek Gap,"Apr 05, Thu",11.30
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586120,"We were the last to leave camp, but the timing was still fast for us. Most of our bubble mates were headed to Franklin for two nights. I had decided that we would hike close to Winding stair Gap, spend the night in the tent and then do a Nero and have a one night stay in Franklin to Resupply and shower. It sounded like a really good plan....until it started raining. Two nights in Franklin began to sound more appealing. My reasoning won out though. The tent is waterproof! What’s the problem? If a little rain sends us running for shelter, we sure won’t survive the elements for six months. 
We stopped by a stream to have lunch and huddled under some thick branches. The rain actually stopped for a time but we didn’t realize it because drips from the tree branches continued to patter the tops of our heads. When we got ourselves moving again, we realized our foolishness. There was a steep climb and a bit of a rock scramble up to the top of Albert Mountain. With all of the hype build up, we were expecting a more difficult climb. We both made it to the top easily and were rewarded by georgous views and a marker that indicated we had reached 100 miles!Once we reached Rock Gap Shelter, we considered stopping for the night. It was still early in the day and stopping there would leave us with almost four miles to do early in the morning to get the 9am shuttle to Franklin. We decided to press on a bit further and ended up setting up our tent on the top of a mountain near mile marker 106.7. 
It rained all night long. A couple of loud claps of thunder had us questioning our decision to sleep at such a high elevation, but no lightening followed it up. The wind howled without stopping for a breath, but a small embankment protected us from most of it. There was no escaping the rain though. It relentlessly tapped its fingers across the top of our tent All Night Long!!","Betty Creek Gap
",Mile 106.7,"Apr 06, Fri",9.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586422,"The rain kissed our tent straight through the night and on into the morning. Our quilts were slightly damp around the footbox. Our packs don’t fit inside the tent so we keep them in the vestibule with the rain covers on. A puddle had formed on Cole’s side of the tent and his bag was a bit muddy. It was a gross feeling setting up a tent in the rain, sleeping through the night in the rain, taking down a tent in the rain and the mud and then hiking through the rain some more. I just felt damp from my head to my toes, but I kept a smile on my face and Cole did too. 
We arrived at Winding Stair Gap in plenty of time. Miss Janet arrived and gave all of the wet Hikers a cold drink. Finally Ron Haven pulled in with his bus and drove us to a hostel in Franklin called Baltimore Jacks. I had reserved a private room for Cole and I. It quickly became clear that they had overbooked. There was another pair who had also made reservations and were without a room. We had actually shared a shelter with them on the first night on the AT. Their trail names are Dunk and Egg. For a low low price, the hostel offered us a large room with two queen beds, kitchen, sitting area and bath. The catch was that we had to share it with Dunk and Egg. They were a nice couple and we had no problem with that.
Once we were settled, I washed ALL of our clothing. This meant hanging out in our room with our rain gear on.  I also laid out the tent at the back of the building to dry it out. 
When that was finished, we headed to Outdoor 76. I had heard that they had a foot guru who could tell you exactly what footwear was right for you. Rob spent almost two hours measuring and examining my feet and talking to me extensively about feet and shoes. He knows a lot. In the end, he told me that the boots I had were the perfect ones for my feet at this time and that my orthotics were (mostly) doing what they should do for my feet. He re-laced my boots a different way, gave Cole and I each a free AT bandana and wished us the best on our thru-  hike. Wow! The next time I need new footwear, I just might drive to Franklin N.C. to get it. 
I was semi relieved that I didn’t need to invest in new footwear just yet, but still concerned because my foot pain problem wasn’t solved. I have a bunionette forming on the outside of my right foot. It is very painful. It seems that footwear wasn’t the solution. 
We made a quick stop at the dollar store and the grocery store, then we rushed back to the hostel to catch a shuttle to an all you can eat buffet. Yum! A shuttle bus of hungry hikers put a good dent in that buffet table!!","Mile 106.7

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586583,"We took the 9am shuttle back to Winding Stair Gap where we had gotten off the day before. It was cold but sunny. 
During our first week on the trail, there were always people around. The second week on the trail was much quieter and some days I was able to hike for an hour or even two without seeing another person. Today it was like the first week on the trail. It was so busy and there were constantly people passing me or gathered in groups at rest spots. I imagine that the congestion was due to the fact that we were just coming out of a very popular trail town. We had only stayed one night, but many people we spoke to had stayed two or more nights. One group had even stayed for four nights. Some of them were nursing aches and pains ( there are so many people out here with wrapped knees and blistered feet!), while others just seemed to enjoy the culture and food offerings of the popular hiking town. 
Today the trail had a few steeper ups and downs than North Carolina has generally been giving us. I think that Georgia has a thing against switch backs. She just sends you straight up the mountain at the sharpest angle but shortest distance possible all the while shouting “get out, get out!” North Carolina has been much kinder, gently easing us up and down the mountains on long curving switchbacks. “Stay a while, stay a while”, she says and eases you into a friendly trail town where everyone caters to hikers and money is easy to spend. 
The trees had not yet sprung their spring foliage, but that did not stop them from dressing up for me today. Just after crossing Snowbird Gap, I entered a forest where the leaf barren branches of the trees were coated in a layer of glistening ice. Further up the trail it seemed to become autumn. Dried up golden leaves still clung to their host branches, swaying in the gentle breeze and refusing to let go. Stubborn! Even further up the trail, tall trees with long outstretched and intertwining arms displayed bright green moss covered coats for all to see. 
One single,  moderately narrow trunked tree observed these great displays and then outdid them all. One side of his modest little trunk was completely adorned from forest floor to as far as I could reach with a thick array of toadstools. What a show off!
Camp at Wayah Bald Shelter was very crowded and way over capacity. The gathering was loud as well. Cole really enjoys socializing around the campfire in the evening, but on this night the language was colourful and the jokes inappropriate. Thankfully he had enough sense to take his leave. As on most nights, I was in bed much earlier than he was with my compression socks on and feet propped up hoping for the soreness to subside before morning.","Winding Stair Gap

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586584,"It rained through most of the night and I slept poorly. By morning it was just a light drizzle. Packing up in the rain is my least favourite thing to do. We ate a cold, terribly unhealthy breakfast (honey bun for Cole and pop tart for me), and slowly got ourselves moving. When it is raining we pack up everything inside the tent, and wait. When the drips on the tent lessen, we jump out, tear down the tent, bundle it into a wet muddy mass, attach it to the top of Cole’s bag and head off down the trail. I can be feeling icky and miserable packing up wet things at camp, but once I get moving on down the trail, things just seem brighter, even if it is still dreary and wet. These silly manmade things that we haul around just get all blechy in the rain. In nature the rain reveals another side of the majestic beauty of God’s creation. 
The trail was very muddy from all of the rain, and very slippery too. My poles saved me a number of times from falling on my keester into the mud. The trail was busy again too. I was slow, as usual. I told Cole that we would not be camping at the next shelter but would move on beyond it to find a quiet place to pitch the tent. He was not in favour of this idea at all. He really likes to hang out with the guys in the evening. They are always impressed by his hiking ability, and for a 13 year old boy it feels pretty good to fit in and find the approval of a group of cool guys. 
As soon as we passed the shelter my whole body started to scream “enough! enough!” We found one unmarked campsite, but it was already occupied. Beyond that there was zero opportunity to set up a tent because the path became very narrow and steep. Soon we were up on a ridge with sharp drop offs on either side. Majestic views of the mountains on both sides of us were framed by the dramatic charred remains of a forest. It was a sad yet stunning sight. Caught up in the view, it was easy to momentarily forget my sore feet.
We came to a place where the path brought us to the edge of a cliff with nothing but spectacular views of the mountains on three sides. Making a sharp turn to the right, the  trail then followed a steep rocky descent. In time it flattened out again and we eventually came upon more unmarked campsites and were able to set up our tent. The views today were the most dramatic and spectacular I have seen on the AT thus far.","Wayah Bald Shelter
",Unmarked Campsite Mile 133,"Apr 09, Mon",13.20
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586586,"Just a few miles past our unmarked campsite, we arrived at the NOC. The stitching had all unraveled on one of Cole’s gloves so we bought him a new pair there. We also used the computer at the outfitters to print out our permit to enter the Smokey mountains, and we picked up the Resupply box I had shipped to there. Here is the one thing that isn’t great about shipping Resupply boxes. From Hiawassee to Franklin we had food left over. In Franklin we picked up our Resupply box and had too much food. Arriving at the NOC we now still had food in our bags and were picking up A-LOT more! However, resupply opportunities would be scarce between now and Gatlinburg which would still be 7 days away provided we could keep moving forward at a steady pace. I contemplated putting some items in the hiker box, but changed my mind.
Coming out of the NOC there was a long and steep uphill climb....like an all day up hill climb! With the extra weight in our bags, even Cole, my mountain goat, was getting tired. Sometimes the incline was gentle, on a trail blanketed with soft leaves it dirt, but sometimes it was harsh and steep, taking us over long sections of jagged rock and root covered narrow slopes. For most of the day we hike close together and I enjoyed having Cole near by. It was such a long and difficult day. The sun was getting low and Cole eventually took off ahead of me to get to camp and set up the tent. That last hour was the most difficult sixty minutes I’d had on the trail yet. My feet were screaming, I was exhausted and I just wanted to stop. With the sun disappearing quickly I was also getting very cold.
At long last I arrived at Sassafras Gap Shelter. I was so thankful that Cole had the tent set up and I went straight to bed without eating. Cole had eaten and went to hang our food on a tree. He was gone for a long time! Too long. The sun had set. I felt around for a headlamp but couldn’t find one, so I grabbed my phone and put it in flashlight mode and set out to find him. The packed campground had gone completely silent as all of the other hikers had turned in for the night. In the distance I could see a headlamp shining and I thought I heard crying. I headed in that direction and found Cole. Our paracord had snapped dropping the food bags to the ground. One of the bags had ripped. Cole had been attempting to hang the second food bag with the remaining portion of the rope which was too short and he and was frustrated and quite upset. 
That night we slept....or laid...with our food in our tent. I was too stressed and worried to get much sleep. Would we be able to replace our equipment in Fontana village? What would we do with our food at night until then?","Unmarked Campsite Mile 133

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586605,"Yesterday I had noticed that Cole’s ears were very red and enflamed. One had bumps on it that looked like bites. I gave him antihistamine and put some hydrocortisone cream on them. This morning one ear looked even worse and he said it hurt to the touch. Now I was worried about that. The weather was beautiful and a short distance from the shelter we came upon a gorgeous view at Cheoah Bald. My mind was too occupied with the food bag problem and Cole’s swollen ears to appreciate it the way I should have. Being tired didn’t help my mood at all. 
Cole was ahead, as usual and when I caught up to him waiting for me at Stecoah Gap, he was sitting there with a big smile on his face, at a picnic table, chowing down on a banana. In front of him was a big bag of bananas and a half dozen or more apples. The Gap is at a roadway and a lady had pulled up while he was sitting there and brought the fruit over to him, chatted for a while and left. He was working on his third banana. 
I sat at the table and started in on a banana myself. Shortly after, a couple of other hikers showed up and we chatted and devoured fruit together. I shared about the demise of my food bag and before I knew it, duct tape was being pulled out of stashes and unwrapped from hiking poles. The bits and pieces once put together mended the hole in the bag. 
It is amazing how a banana and a bit of duct tape was able to lift my spirits and change my mood. 
I was feeling much better as we headed back out on the trail. It is a good thing too because we had a huge climb ahead of us....Jacob’s Ladder! A half mile 600 foot climb! It was so steep that I almost felt that I should be crawling up it on all fours. Even Cole was climbing at a snail’s pace.
When we reached Brown Fork Gap, it was surprisingly quiet. It seems that many of the hikers who had been at the previous shelter had gotten off the trail at Stecoah Gap to spend the night at a hostel. 
Cole had eaten four bananas and one apple at Stecoah Gap, yet he still ate a full dinner of instant potatoes, instant stuffing and chicken. I think that his hiker hunger has kicked in.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

The thought of a shower at Fontana was motivation enough to make me want to go 12.8 miles. Cole’s ear was looking much better. 
Cole headed out with instructions to stop in an hour. I caught up about 20 minutes later. We rested, chatted with other hikers, gleaned a little more duct tape to strengthen our repair job on our food bag, then  I sent him on ahead again with instructions to stop at 12:30. 
At 12:50, I figured I should have caught him, but no Cole. At 1:00 I was getting worried. Still no sign of Cole. By 1:15 I was now in panic mode. I should have caught up to him by now. Did he stop somewhere and I passed by without seeing him? Did he mishear what time I wanted him to stop? Did he fall down into a ravine somewhere behind me. 1:25 I am in tears, not sure what to do. Go forward or turn and go back? I decided that I would drop my bag at the shelter that was coming up and retrace my steps to where we had rested two hours prior. When I reached the shelter, low and behold, there was my son. Instead of stopping when he was supposed to, he had decided to continue on to the shelter. He doesn’t understand my very strong fear of losing him out here. It is hard to convey a mother’s worries to a 13 year old boy. What he did understand once I pointed it out, was that it was a very hot day, he had traveled 4 miles without meeting up with me and he was carrying the water filter. 
We had a late lunch, rested a while and then carried on. 
Fontana Lake came into view and we knew we were near the shelter. At a parking lot about 1.5 miles from the shelter, Cole was stopped by a couple who had just packed up a table from doing trail magic. They pulled out a plastic bag and started loading him up. By the time I caught up to him, his bag was stuffed with four cans of pop, multiple packets of peanut butter crackers, peanut m and m’s, granola bars and crackers. We walked together for the last mile or so along a beautiful pathway beside the lake. It was late in the day and the sun was going down. Cole couldn’t use his poles because of the big bag of goodies in his hand, but he was ridiculously pleased. Once the Fontana “Hilton” came into view and we saw the restroom/showers, I was ridiculously pleased as well. 
It was a beautiful evening and we set up our tent on a concrete tent pad. There were people everywhere. More pop was being handed around. I had a nice warm shower, but then crawled into my dirty wool base layer before crawling into bed.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

We slept in the Fontana Shelter last night so that we could get ready faster in the morning. I was actually sleeping on a FLAT surface for a change. It seems like no matter where we set up the tent, I am either rolling towards Cole all night or sliding into the wall of the tent. The downfall to sleeping in the shelter is....the snoring!! There was a soft rhythmic hum that was coming from one side of the shelter throughout the night. That didn’t bother me. However, on the other side of Cole was a loud, disruptive chorus without any kind of rhythm or beat. It was nasally grunts and guttural rasps in inconsistent starts and stops.  It almost sounded painful and I was beginning to feel sorry for the poor fellow until I reminded myself that he was getting a good night’s sleep, and I was not! Somehow Cole slept through it all. 
In the morning we were off bright and early, eager to see what The Smokey Mountains had in store for us. We paused at the Fontana Dam visitor Center. Although it was closed, Cole had spied a pop machine and wanted a Sprite to wash down his breakfast. Yes, I know that is a terrible thing to give a teen early in the morning (or maybe ever), but I am trying to keep this scrawny kid of mine from losing any weight. If he wants a pop and it is accessible, no problem. 
We had to hike across the dam, then along a road for a ways. Soon we reached the trail head where there was a box for us to put one half of our permits in. The other half of the permit has to remain in our possession the entire time we are in the Smokey Mountains.
With permits deposited, we began the long and steep ascent up into the Smokies. It was an all day climb, taking us way up into the mountains where there is sure to be astounding views and unsympathetic weather...as we would quickly find out. 
Eventually our climb brought us to Mollies Ridge Shelter. The shelter was almost full and some hikers had already set up tents with the permission of the Ridge Runner who was there. 
The Smokies are different from the rest of the AT. You are only allowed to stay in the shelters. IF the shelter is full, you may pitch a tent near by. Normally I would prefer my tent, but because rain was expected that night, I was happy to stay in the shelter. There is another odd thing about the smokies. Section hikers get first dibs at the spots in the shelter. So, say I arrive and get all set up and cozy in the shelter and then a section hiker shows up...I (or another thru-hiker) gets the boot. 
Cole and I took the last two spots in the shelter. It was half full of boy scout section hikers. Luckily no other section hikers showed up, and we got to stay. 
The temperature was moderately cool. We were quite warm in our bedding. The snoring was soft and gentle and we slept well.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587135,"The rain began pouring down early in the morning. As the sky brightened, the crew of hikers huddled under their covers and protected from the elements by the shelter, were very slow to begin rousing. Cole and I ventured from beneath our quilts and began getting ready for a very wet and rather cold day. A few hikers seemed to be considering hunkering down in the shelter until the rain passed. 
With rain gear on, Cole and I boldly stepped out into the downpour and headed down the trail.
Before I proceed, let me say this. I love my hiking boots. They are New Balance Model 1400 Men’s 7.5 2E For a year now, these boots have brought me through all kinds of harsh hiking weather warm, safe and dry. But not today. Today they let the water in. A lot of it. On close examination I could see that the bottoms were pulling away just a wee bit. Water can easily invade through wee little openings, and it did. My right foot was soon drenched while my left was only slightly damp. The path wasn’t difficult, but for some reason I was struggling. My right foot seemed especially sore...or maybe because it was wet it just made me think it hurt worse than usual.
Around noon we came upon a blue blaze leading to Spence Field Shelter. We decided it would be a perfect place to stop for lunch. When we reached the shelter, we found a ridge runner inside sitting beside a fire drying out her clothes. (The shelters in The Smokey Mountains have fireplaces inside them) I put my wet boots and sox next to hers and we chatted for a while. She told us that the temperature was going to drop well below freezing overnight and on into the next day. My foot hurt, I was wet and cold. Sitting beside the fire getting dried out sounded like a good way to spend the afternoon before the freeze hit. But, we had only come six miles! I considered the fact that there were no guarantees that we would get a spot in the next shelter. I am a slow hiker and we are usually near to the last hikers to arrive at camp. I did not want to be setting up a tent in the freezing cold. There was also no guarantee that I would have the opportunity to dry out my boots at the next shelter. If we stayed, we were guaranteed to get dry and have a spot in the shelter. I felt a bit guilty for a while, but the decision was made. We stayed.
 Cole fetched firewood all afternoon to keep the fire burning. ( I did have to bribe him to do it  that by scratching his back) A small group of hikers showed up for a lunch break also, but they decided to press on through the rain. The sun came out for a brief time, but then the rain returned, heavier than ever. Nobody else arrived at the shelter.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587183,"When we woke up in the morning, the forest was blanketed in a soft white coat of snow. Our ridge runner companion was on the move very early, and so we got ourselves packed up as well. Once you crawl out from under those covers, the only thing to do to keep warm is to move. It was so cold, and the thermostat continued to dip. I was so grateful that we were starting the day warm and dry. I’d like to say that the day continued on that way, but it did not. Snow continued to fall as we trudged north, climbing Rocky Top which should have given us spectacular views. The trees were certainly majestic in their white coats, but beyond what was in close proximity to us there was only fog. 
The cold was not kind to our gear. Within an hour our mouth pieces and tubes on our hydration systems were frozen. With the fresh coat of snow on the trail and no tracks to follow, we were occasionally nervous about being off the trail. The Guthooks app on my phone was of little help. In the cold weather it kept telling me that we were off the trail. If the distance hadn’t been so ludicrous, I may have believed it, but when it told us we were 24 miles off trail, I knew that couldn’t be true. Eventually the cold zapped the power out of the phone completely. 
Have you ever tried to dig a cat hole in the frozen ground with a plastic trowel? Ya. That didn’t go so well. Sorry SMNP, I couldn’t “leave no trace” that time.
I had put my right foot inside of a plastic bag before putting on my boot that morning, hoping to fend off the moisture. It delayed it, but it did not keep the wetness at bay for more than a few hours.
Cole’s fingers were frozen in his new “warm” gloves. I gave him my thin gloves to wear under his, and when that failed to keep him warm, I gave him a pair of my wool socks to wear over top of both. We had one pair of hand warmers that he tucked inside his gloves as well. Eventually what warmed him up in the end was just constant, continuous movement. 
Normally I let him hike ahead for a while and then stop to wait up for me. I did not want him standing still in the cold, so today he had to slow down to my pace. We plowed on through the snow, not stopping to rest as we normally would. It felt like we were in a Farley Mowat novel, fighting against the natural elements and the odds to reach a far of destination. 
Around lunch time we came upon Derrick Knob shelter which had been our original destination the day before. Inside, it was half full of hikers all huddled around a blazing fire, still trying to get dried out and thawed from the day before. In the vicinity there were still tents set up, partially buried in snow. This scene reassured me that we had made the right decision the previous day. 
We ate our lunch outside of the shelter as the frozen hikers continued their thawing process by the fire. Then we headed north once again. 
Our plan was to get as close to Clingmans Dome as we possibly could. There is a free shuttle every morning from the Clingmans Dome parking lot down to Gatlinburg where we intended to thaw out and resupply. 
By the time we reached Silers Bald Shelter, I was quite wet, but still warm and feeling like I could press on. There was one more shelter 1.7 miles ahead that I wanted to reach. 
The scene inside Silers Bald Shelter was just as dismal as in the shelter before. The fire was blazing and an enormous pile of gathered wood was heaped outside. Just to be clear...the fireplaces in the shelters really don’t do much to warm up the inside of the shelter like you think it should. The only way to benefit from the fire is to be directly in front of it,so that is where we found a group of hikers huddled, a string of socks hung and a pile of frozen boots heaped. 
One of the hikers informed us that the road to the Clingman’s Dome parking lot had been closed due to ice. There were no indications of when it would open. I really wanted to press on.  I did not want to become part of this scene. 
The lady who had told me about the road closure encouraged us to stay. “There is room in the shelter here for you. You don’t want to go on to the next shelter and end up having to stay in your tent,” she said. 
I’ve watched enough TV to know that the guy who presses on when he should have stayed always freezes to death....or gets eaten by zombies, so I decided we would stay. After all, the scene had already sucked me in. I had been standing still for ten minutes and that was all it took for the cold to set in. It hit my poor wet toes first and hung on relentlessly. Cole and I set up our beds and I immediately put on my wool base layer and heavy wool socks and crawled under my covers. My toes throbbed from the cold. I rubbed them and rubbed them. I stayed there under my covers until morning ( except for one quick escape to pee in the snow), never getting warm and not sleeping very much at all. I had a clear internet signal so I chatted with my husband for a little bit, and I cried. Cole, who has the exact same sleep system and clothing layers as I do, was toasty all night and slept well.","Spence Field Shelter
",Silers Bald Shelter,"Apr 16, Mon",11.80
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587598,"In the morning the fire was still blazing. One lone hiker was huddled over it. I thought I would take the opportunity to dry my hiking Sox. Both pairs were now wet, one from hiking in and one from Cole using them as mitts. I crawled out of my bedding, slipped on my crocs and ventured close to the fire, stretching my sox out in front of me to get them over the flame. The woman there was wide eyed and worried. “The road is still closed to Clingman’s Dome”, she said in a desperate voice, “and we are all out of firewood! I’ve been awake all night tending the fire and we need more wood!” 
I slowly retracted my sox and returned to my bed. I would hike in my sleeping sox. I roused Cole. We would not be hanging around the shelter all day to thaw. We were headed for Clingman’s Dome!
Cole had slept with our water filter to keep it from freezing and I had slept with our bag of electronics. Our water bottles had been right beside me but not under the covers. All of our water was frozen solid. We each had a second empty water bottle so we filled those for the day. 
Other hikers began to stir. News of the continued road closure had everyone in a buzz trying to figure out what to do. Some were staying put, some were continuing on to Newfound Gap to hitchhike into town. Our plan was to try for the noon shuttle at Clingmans Dome hoping that the road would be open by then.
Although it was very cold and windy when we set out, the skys were clear and the sun was shining brightly. The first half of the stretch to Clingmans Dome was relatively easy terrain. Then we began to climb. And Climb. Cole was trying unsuccessfully to rush me along, but I can only do the speed that I can safely do. The higher we got, the more spectacular the views. 
We reached the fork that would either take us up to Clingmans Dome, the highest spot on the AT, or it would take us down to the parking lot where there might be a shuttle bus. We chose the left fork, hustled up to the dome, snapped some gorgeous pictures, then raced down to the big old empty parking lot. The road was still closed ! A National Parks’ worker pulled into the lot in a snow plow. We asked him about the road, hoping beyond hope that he would offer us a ride, but knowing that he probably wasn’t allowed to. He said that the road was still icy and he didn’t know when it would open. 
As we milled around planning our next move, strong gusts of wind pushed us about like they wanted us to hurry up, make a decision and get a move on. Would we stay and wait for the road to open, continue on to Newfound Gap, or head to the next shelter? Our food was low, our feet felt good, although mine were wet. In fact, every pair of sox I had was now wet.  I wanted to get dry. I needed to get dry. 
Suddenly a huge gust of wind tore my rain cover off of my back pack. I chased it for a short distance before the wind sent it flying over the edge of the mountain! That solidified the plan. Somehow get to town. 
We retraced our steps back to where the AT had divided and continued trekking north. By now the temperature had begun a rapid climb. You might think that this would result in a warm and pleasant afternoon hike. Nope. The trees were heavily laden with a coat of snow and with the increased warmth they quickly cast off that extra layer like a thoughtless child excited to bask in the sun. Down onto our heads the trees rained, often dropping pellets or chunks of ice and snow. Without my rain cover, my pack quickly became soaked. The trail turned into a river of slush and once again my feet  were drenched. 
After a long wet trudge through the uncaring trees, we arrived at the Newfound Gap parking area. There were lots of cars and people coming and going. Cole, who has arrived before me, was already chatting with a gentleman who was waiting on another hiker. He said that he might have room for us in his car, but he wasn’t sure how many hikers he was picking up, so couldn’t guarantee it. He gave Cole a pastry and me a fruit juice, both were greatly appreciated.
I knew that I stunk, and that my hair was a disheveled mess. My clothes were dirty and wet. Despite all that, one kind couple from Texas agreed to drive us into Gatlinburg. We paid for a one night stay, but we quickly realized that we were not going to be able to get done everything we needed to do before the shuttle back to the trail left the next morning so we decided to spend a second night and take a zero. A took a long hot bath and everything was as right as rain once more!","Silers Bald Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587863,"The first thing on the “to do” list the next morning was to get a new rain cover for my backpack and shoe goo to try to repair my boots. As luck would have it, I scored a free rain cover from the hiker box at the NOC. In the same hiker box we got some cheese and cracker packs, shampoo and conditioner ( we don’t carry those) half a can of permethrin that I was going to treat our footprint with, and a moleskin to put on my baby toe. What a haul! 
Next we took the blue trolly to Food City to resupply. We have become tired of the usual fair. Cole had heard from another hiker that the one dollar mini pies made for a good breakfast, so guess what we bought. Pie! We’re packing pie! 
Back at the hotel I repaired my boots, sprayed the footprint, spent one hour on the phone with Straight Talk trying to successfully add more time to my phone plan, and had another long tub. Cole had been dreaming about a pizza buffet so we headed to Cicis for dinner. It was a productive day.","Gatlinburg

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587865,"During the month of April the Baptist church in Gatlinburg runs a free shuttle from town to the AT twice a day. We got ourselves moving early so that we could make it to the 8:30 shuttle. It was sunny, but windy and cold as we arrived back at Newfound Gap. The initial stretch of the trail was a long climb. With all of my layers on I thought I would be hot, but the icy gusts of wind kept cooling me right back down. The trail was pretty, and in the sun, while sheltered from the wind, I moved a bit more slowly, taking in the surroundings and enjoying the morning. When the meandering trail took me out of the sun and into the wind I pressed forward with increased speed and head bent down. 
Eventually we reached a ridge line which we traveled along for most of the rest of the day. The elevation was high, the temperature was cold, the wind was fierce and the sun had abandoned us. Where there should have been phenomenal views, there was only fog. In certain places along the ridge,  sections of trees were loaded down with ice. As we passed by they rudely chucked rectangular shaped pellets of ice down on us. I was intrigued by the fact that the ice was all rectangular shaped, but not curious enough to stop in the cold to investigate. 
By mid afternoon, when we were not far from the shelter, the sun emerged to warm us. We found a sunny spot near the shelter to have our dinner and chatted with the other hikers who trickled in after us. 
I headed to my bed early as the temperature dove towards freezing. Cole filtered water for us for the next day, mingled with the crowd then came to bed too. 
At around 10: 30 I ventured out into the cold to use the privy. On the table outside of the shelter sat our water filter.....our water filter that had to be kept from freezing. Cole had forgotten to bring it inside. Ugh!  It’s a good thing that we have purification tablets. We would use the tablets until we could get a replacement for the filter since it was now untrustworthy.","Newfound Gap

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587867,"We spent a good part of the day walking along the mountain ridge again today, but the breeze was very gentle when it decided to blow, and the sun was generous with its rays. The ice laden trees seemed to have dropped their arsenal of rectangular pellets overnight. The trail was riddled with them. I hiked in my layers, accepting that I would be sweaty and hot while climbing, but comfortably warm while descending or standing still in the sunshine. It was a lovely day to hike and the views of the mountains were plentiful. Five miles from the shelter I came upen a couple sitting in the grass having lunch. I paused to chat. Their names were Boss and Vapor. What was amazing about them was that Vapor was completely blind. He uses his trekking poles like he would a cane. Boss guides him along telling him where obstacles are. How incredibly courageous!!
When we arrived at Cosby Knob Shelter, the shelter was already quickly filling up with both thru hikers and section hikers. The tenting sites were limited and quickly filling up too. The section hikers told us that the shelter was completely booked. When section hikers book the shelter, thru hikers have to stay in tents. Instead of waiting around to see if they would get booted, many of the thru hikers elected to move out of the shelter and into their tents. Cole and I took a chance and stayed bedded down in the shelter. If the shelter was indeed completely booked, then some of the section hikers failed to show up. We got to stay in the shelter through the night.","Pecks Corner Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587871,"It was a gorgeous day to hike..practically perfect really!  Today was our last day in the Smokey Mountains. After treating us so harshly, it was very nice of them to see us off in such a lovely way. Our first day in The Smokey Mountains had been one long uphill climb. Today, after an initial steep ascent, most of the trail out of the smokies was one long descent. Although you don’t feel that you are working as hard on the descents, they are actually harder on the knees and feet than uphill climbs are. My knees have only just whimpered half heartedly up until now, but today they were doing some full on complaining. Coincidentally, so was my 13 year old. The former was treated with Tylenol and Advil. The latter received a scolding plus pizza and pop once we reached Standing Bear  Farm, just outside of the smokies. In both cases I am not completely certain which remedy worked, but at this moment ( 8pm) I am not hearing/feeling any complaints from either party. Before leaving the Smokies we had to check out the very last shelter. It is the only shelter left that has a cage on the front to keep bears out. The rest of the cages were removed from the shelters because apparently people were feeding the bears through the cage and getting trapped inside.Once outside of the smokies, the trail led us down to a beautiful green valley and meandered along side a gently running stream. Wild flowers lined both sides of the path. It was a lovely change of scenery. Eventually the stream ended just past a waterfall and the trail stopped at a road. We had to follow the road for a way before we came to the trail again. It led us up a scary flight of stone steps and then through the trees for a short distance before we came to another road. Up that road was Standing Bear Farm where we filled our bellies with pizza and pop, purchased a few Resupply items and then pushed on.  A two mile up hill climb brought us to a lovely stream with campsites near by. As I type I am watching the sun set and listening to the stream. What a perfect ending to a lovely day.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587875,"We got off to a very early start this morning. Rain was in the forecast and we wanted to make sure we got a spot at the next shelter so that we didn’t have to deal with a wet tent. It was mostly overcast today, but the sun made an appearance from time to time. It felt like there was a lot of climbing, but when isn’t there? I struggled with the last few miles. It was exciting when the scenery changed as we crossed two balds. On the first Bald there was an FAA tower on the summit. Cole wanted to know if they would have a washroom and a pop machine. lol The second Bald we crossed was Max Patch. It is a popular site seeing destination and there were a lot of people about. On the Bald it was extremely windy and cold. At the top of the Bald Cole got at least half of what he was looking for. A group of people had set up some trail magic for thru hikers. They had pop(and beer) fresh fruit, cookies, and the fixings so that you could make yourself a sandwich. We stopped for a short time and enjoyed the offerings.
Cole went ahead as we left the trail magic. Just after we came down off the Bald the trail split. Cole was almost out of sight, but I caught a glimpse of him heading in what I thought was the wrong direction. I stopped at the Fork and hollered to him but didn’t get a reply. I continued on the correct path, not completely certain which direction he had gone.
Shortly I came upon a hiker heading sobo and I asked him if a young teen had passed him by. He said he wasn’t sure because he had just been sitting down off the trail a ways not paying attention. I asked him to keep a lookout for Cole, then continued on hoping that I would find him ahead. I didn’t.  However, after a while I head shouting from behind me “Mom, Mom!” He had indeed taken the wrong trail. When the trail faded and he couldn’t see any white blazes, he had turned around. The hiker I had spoken to found him and had set him on the right course. I don’t think that my fear of losing him is ever going to diminish.We were able to get a spot in the shelter and stayed dry through the night.","Painter Branch Campsite

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587919,"All of our shelter mates were planning to head straight to Hot Springs today which was 17 miles away. I had never hiked that far and my tired feet were not really on board with that plan. When we set out in the wind and the rain, I wasn’t exactly sure how far I would be able to make it. The weather was unpleasant and there were some miserable moments throughout the day when I questioned my sanity for wanting to hike the entire length of the AT. But, there were also times when the wind was calm and the rain gentle,  and I was able to lift my head, take  in my surroundings and find joy. 
A long stretch of the trail had us meandering back and forth down the side of a mountain. On one side we would be fighting against the elements trying not to get blown over and thinking that we should be wearing more layers. Then we would come around a bend and although we could still hear the wind howling fiercely, the air around us was calm.
 Numerous trees had fallen across the trail from the wind. One blow down was so big that we had to go a distance off the trail and then forge the way back to it. 
My feet were wanting me to stop. Desperately! There was a shelter at mile 271.3. It would put us within 3 miles of Hot Springs making it a 14.7 mile day. More rain was expected and so getting to the shelter sounded really appealing. Now if only I could convince my feet. Cole went ahead to save us two spots. I slowed right down to almost a crawl and took my sweet time getting through the last mile and a half. When I arrived, we were the only ones there. Later in the evening a girl named “buckets” arrived. It was a very small shelter with only enough room for five. Three fit very comfortably. Or should I say, three people plus all of the mice. I know there have been mice in the previous shelters. I have seen evidence of them. However, never have I heard them scurrying about right above my head all night long!

I tried calling Laughing Heart Lodge to book us a room, but my phone kept telling me I was roaming when my plan is nationwide. So, we just showed up in the morning hoping for the best. They had no rooms, only tent space and bunks in the bunk room. We didn’t know it but this did indeed work out to be the best.  A lady there called the hostel down the road to see if they had a room available, and they did. Elmer’s Sunnybank Inn and Hostel turned out to be a magnificent place. It is 170 years old and is furnished with antiques. It is on the national register of historic places. It is charming and quiet, full of history and character. We are staying in the Earl Schaffer room (Earl Schaffer was the first person to thru hike the AT) Earl stayed in this room during his thru hike. Our room has a huge balcony off of it. Normally they have dinner that you can pay extra for, but not today. We did sign up for breakfast though. They will ring the bell in the morning to let us know when breakfast is ready. It is just so charming and very tempting to stay another day....but the AT calls (and the pockets are only so deep!) I would love to come back here and visit again one day!","

The earplugs drowned it out nicely. There are lots of different kinds of people out here on the trail, with different motivation, different goals and different priorities. For some, it is a great big party, and when they get to town they “celebrate”. This isn’t the crowd that we hang out with, but sometimes they are hard to avoid. We have been told that the “party crowd” thins out the further along the trail you go. That will be nice. 
In the morning, Elmer, the hostel owner,made us a wonderful vegetarian breakfast. We had an omelet, toast, granola and fresh fruit. He rang the meal bell when it was ready and the four hikers (including us) who had signed up for breakfast all filed in to the small dining room ( there is also a much bigger dining room in the house). The food was beautifully laid out and it tasted delicious! Elmer told us a little about the history of the house and his collection of antiques. We also learned that it was his 81st birthday. It was a lovely breakfast and it was hard to pack up and get back on the trail, but we did. 
I’ve noticed a pattern on the AT. When you arrive in town you descend down down down to a lower elevation. Then, you rest up, clean up, fill up your backpack with multiple days of food, and then they send you climbing back up up up the mountain quickly negating the positive effects of your zero/Nero.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588384,"It was a wet morning, but in the shelter we were dry. We were packed shoulder to shoulder, six people in a five person shelter. All night long we had to contend with a loud symphony of snoring and farting to which I contributed generously. (Blame the trail food) The mice were exceptionally active throughout the course of the night and made for entertaining conversation in the morning as we each speculated what the little critters were up to. My vote went to dragging carcasses across the roof of the shelter. 
I had a difficult day today. I felt a lot like a middle aged, overweight, out of shape woman with bad feet trying to haul herself up and down mountains. Oh wait! That is exactly what I am. 
The rain made a reappearance in the early afternoon. We stopped at Little Laurel Shelter for a late lunch, but as we sat there getting colder and colder and watching the rain fall, we began to contemplate stopping for the day. Many other hikers paused at the shelter to contemplate the exact same question. The next shelter was another seven miles away. Our original intent was to find a flat place to set up the tent somewhere  in another four miles. After examining the guide book, we decided that we would probably have a hard time finding a place to camp. I was not confident I could make it to the next shelter and Cole didn’t want to set up the tent in the rain. It was settled. We would stay. I was feeling very guilty for doing such a short day and concerned about having enough food to get to Erwin. However, once I was fed and bundled up and warm in my bedding, the worry diminished. We will try to do more miles for the next few days to make it up.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588458,"The day started off wet. Again! We were dry in the shelter and happy for that, but I was feeling determined to make up for having hiked such a short distance the day before. 
It was raining as we set out and I asked Cole to stay with me. 
“Do you think it is too cold for me to be waiting for you in the rain?” He asked. 
“No,” I replied, “I just want to hike with my son.”
He rolled his eyes a bit, but didn’t verbally complain. When I’m struggling to have a positive outlook, it helps to have company while hiking. (Unless he is in a bad mood too!)
The trail was wet and slippery from mud and sometimes difficult to navigate.
The scenery began to change as we started to climb.
We came upon a sign warning us that there was an exposed ridgline ahead. There was also a blue blazed “bad weather trail” that we could take around it. The rain was petering out, and although it was chilly, there was little to no wind. We chose the ridgeline.
What they didn’t warn us about on the sign was that the ridgeline was mostly a rock scramble. I was grateful that the rain had stopped, but the rocks were still slippery. Slow and steady were our steps. Clouds stole any possibility of a view, but I still thoroughly enjoyed hiking the ridgeline. It lifted my spirits and added excitement to the day.
Not long after we came down off the ridge, the clouds cleared and the sun appeared. We stopped at Jerry Cabin Shelter for lunch. Not long after we arrived, a cat appeared. It had a stub for a tail and one of his ears had a bite out of it. In the shelter log we read that someone had named him Jerry after the shelter.  He meowed and purred and rubbed up against us looking for food. He was so cute and made me miss my own kittys at home. We had no extra food to feed him, but when more people arrived, he moved on to begging from them. Poor little guy!
After a good rest, we continued on.
One strange thing that I had decided I wanted to see on the A.T. was someone painting blazes. Well, after over 300 miles of hiking, I got my wish. Poor “Booonie Man” must have thought I was a little crazy when I got so excited to see him. He posed for me so I could get a picture of him painting. “It’s not my best work” he said. I couldn’t stop smiling for at least a mile after that. 
We had originally intended to stop at Flint Mountain Shelter, however someone on the trail told us that there had been sickness there. We didn’t know if this was true or just a rumour, but we decided not to chance it. We hiked almost one mile past the shelter and then set up the tent. It was a warm sunny evening and a nice night to be in the tent. However, there is one thing besides rain that turns me off of sleeping in the tent. Cole’s feet. Oh boy do they stink! Once inside the tent, the fumes from his feet and socks overtake the small enclosed space. Since it was such a lovely evening, I pulled out my small collapsible water bucket, filled it with water and washed Cole’s feet with Dr. bronners soap. Then I pulled out two of his three pairs of sox, washed them and hung them to dry. The tent would be smelling fresh for the night!","Little Laurel Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588726,"All night last night we listened to dogs barking in the distance. It made Cole nervous at first, but the sounds never got closer or further away so we decided that they must be penned up somewhere, not running loose. 
The moon was so bright that it felt like we were sleeping under a street light. I can’t say that I had a great sleep last night, but I can say that the day was beautiful. We climbed a lot. It seems like that is a redundant statement that by now should just be taken for granted. On the AT, we climb. I am not particularly fond of climbing. The scenery was varied and that made it enjoyable.
By noon we had put in eight miles. We were pushing for another 15 mile day. Somehow I didn’t do well on our Resupply and we were going to run short if we didn’t push through to Erwin by Monday. We stopped for a nice long lunch break and chatted with a few people who passed by us. Some of them talked about the long stretch of rainy days that we’d had and how “bad thoughts” had been creeping in. I’ve    had those “bad thoughts” too. The “This sucks, why am I doing this?” thoughts. But then there are the “wow” moments, like up on the ridgeline, when you see clearly exactly why you are doing it.  It is encouraging to know that I am not the only person who has doubts on those miserable days. Sometimes when I look at how other people seem to be rocking it out here, I feel like I must be the only one with those “bad thoughts”
One of the people who passed by us while we were resting told us that there was trail magic at Sam’s Gap. The word “pizza” snuck into the conversation. Yes we had just eaten lunch, but Sam’s Gap was still three miles away. If we high tailed it down the trail fast enough we could easily burn off our lunch. So high tail it we did. Cole went ahead. He is so much faster! 
As I descended into the Gap, a lady passed by me and told me to hurry because the trail magic was starting to pack it. Despite the complaints from my feet, I picked it up a notch. 
When I arrived at the gap, there was still a lot of food spread out across the table and Cole was indulging. I should have reminded myself that climbing mountains on a full stomach is a bad idea, but I didn’t. Two slices of pizza, a banana and a cookie later, the wisdom resurfaced. By then it was too late and I was already hauling my butt up a mountain. 
We found ourselves a nice spot at Lowgap campsite that evening. Neither of us had any desire for dinner. Going to bed on a full stomach is a good feeling indeed.","Mile 309

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588728,"Well, the day started off a bit on the rough side. In the morning I asked Cole to hike with me for fifteen minutes. It was a cold morning and my request was a burden to him. Apparently walking at my speed keeps him no warmer than standing in one spot does. So, he decided that he would walk behind me for a distance, turn around and head in the opposite direction for a bit, then turn around again and walk until he was behind me again. In essence he was doing the trail three times over just so that he could walk at the pace he pleased. Each time he returned to me I could hear the heavy stomping of his feet right up to my heels before he wheeled around once again.
After thirty minutes of this behaviour, he asked if he could now continue on ahead down the trail. He didn’t like my answer. He also didn’t take too kindly to me telling him that he was being childish. In fact, he had some pretty harsh words in response. And so, this is how our day began and this is how our day continued on. 
By lunch time we were still at odds, but were civil. When we stopped for lunch, a hiker named Half Slow stopped to talk to us for a bit. He told us that Miss Janet (A well known trail Angel) would be at Spivey Gap shortly if we wanted a ride into Erwin to Resupply. The town is a few miles from the trail and for a couple of days I had been trying to figure how we would get into Erwin to stock up on groceries. A hostel beside the trail runs shuttles for guests, but I was not looking to stay at a hostel. This opportunity sounded perfect. Once again we were jumping up from our lunch break and rushing to get to a Gap.
When we arrived at Spivey Gap, Miss Janet was not there yet, but.....there was trail magic!! Trail Angels had loaded up on Taco Bell and had brought it to the Gap. We arrived just in time to eat it piping hot! Now, you might be thinking, didn’t you just eat lunch? Yes, yes we did. Backpackers burn at least 5000 or more calories a day. Some days we can eat a lot!
Miss Janet arrived shortly after we had devoured our mini feast. Not only did she agree to drive us in to Erwin, but she also invited us to a bbq at her place and to stay for the night. 
On the way to her place she asked us how our day had been. I must have paused a little too long before I replied and Miss Janet called me out on it.
Cole replied to her query for me.
“She had to deal with a moody teenager.”
Wow! I was rather surprised that Cole admitted his poor behaviour. That’s a step in the right direction!
“I asked him to hike with me for fifteen minutes” I added.
“I see what is happening” Miss Janet said. Then she proceeded to describe exactly what I have been trying to deal with for over a month. It was like she had been there following along and listening to our conversations since day one. 
“You race ahead,” she said to Cole “and so your mom is always in the position where she is trying to get to where you are. She never gets any proper breaks because once she reaches you, you are all rested up and ready to go again.”
How did she hit the nail so squarely on the head?  She has been around hikers for a long time and she knows a lot! I just wanted to give her a great big hug for understanding my plight without me even having to explain it to her. She imparted some of her wisdom to us as she drove.
When we arrived at her house, both the inside and the outside were full of hikers. We showered, did our laundry and were fed hamburgers, potato salad and beans.
While many hikers tented in the back yard and a few slept in the living room, Cole and I were given an empty bedroom in which to spread out our bedding and lay our heads. We were truly blessed to have encountered Miss Janet today.","Low Gap Campsite
",Spivey Gap,"Apr 29, Sun",9.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589114,"Last night Miss Janet told us that she would like to help us slack pack today. Slack packing is hiking with only what you need for the day. At 8am Miss Janet set out with a van full of hikers to take them to a different trail head. She then returned for us and three other hikers who all needed to start at Spivey Gap, and a third group that had a yet another starting point. She does a lot of shuttling for hikers and she asks nothing in return. When she sees hikers in town, she pulls over and asks them if they are doing ok and if they need anything. She is so generous to the hiking community.
 For our day of slack packing Cole’s had his water bottle, the filter, our stove and our lunch in his backpack. We hadn’t been to the grocery store yet and all we had to bring for lunch was kraft dinner. In my backpack I had my water bottle, my sheet of tyvec to sit on, my rain gear, my fleece in case I got cold and my puffy in case I got really cold. I didn’t need any of those layers! It was a beautiful warm and sunny day. 
Before we headed out, Miss Janet gave Cole a good long sizing up while he stood there awkwardly. Finally she said, “Is your pack comfortable?”
He shrugged and grunted an affirmative reply.
“Your hip belt is around your stomach and that really isn’t good for your digestion.” She told him. She then loosened all of his straps and showed him how to get his backpack sitting properly on his hips and adjusted right. 
Now, my husband Mark has tried to do this for Cole half a dozen times. Each time Cole has put up a fuss and argued about why it is comfortable the way he has it. Then he readjusts it right back. So, when we headed up the trail I half expected him to silently shift his pack back to the way he’d had it. Instead he said, “Wasn’t that so nice of Miss Janet to show me how to adjust my pack!”
My shoulders and back rejoiced for the whole eleven miles of our slack packing adventure. I wish I could say the same for my feet. You see, I am slower than everyone, and because I am Canadian and obnoxiously polite, I don’t like to keep people waiting. I knew that Miss Janet would be waiting for us. I also knew that she would wait patiently if I didn’t arrive with the others. Still, I felt I needed to keep up. I tried, and failed of course, wearing myself out and putting strain on my feet in the process. Maybe slack packing isn’t for me.
Miss Janet drove us to Walmart in the evening to stock up on groceries and then we returned to her house for another sleepover. It was a much quieter night with only five hikers at the house.","Spivey Gap

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589116,"At 8am we loaded up into Miss Janet’s van one last time and she drove us back to where we had hiked to yesterday on River Road. We exchanged hugs, took pictures and absorbed some more of her wisdom, then we were off. Hiking out of a town with backpacks laden with food resupply, you can guess exactly which direction we were headed. Up!! It was a difficult day for me. Things pained that had not pained before and I was moving very slowly.
In the morning we crossed numerous streams and the water was plentiful. In the afternoon it was dry and the water sources were far apart. It was also hot and we were drinking a lot. 
At Indian Grave Gap we came upon trail magic. Lemonade to drink and water to fill our bottles was a welcome blessing.
The information in my guide book and the information on my Guthooks app were not lining up. Where I thought we were headed was not where we ended up. The campsite we ended up at was at mile 356.5 (according to Guthooks). The one we had been looking for was at mile 356.1, (according to the guide book) but it was nowhere to be found. The difference between the two campsites? The one we ended up at had no water and we were all out!  Thankfully the user added comments in Guthooks told us that there was a poor flowing stream .8 of a mile back in the direction we had come. Cole headed that way with the water bags while I set up the tent. He was successful and soon we had dinner cooking. 
At this campsite there was a tree decorated with Christmas ornaments! It was a quiet night and no other hikers appeared at the campsite.","River Road Erwin

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589188,"Miss Janet had offered suggestions of different ways Cole and I could manage our drastically different hiking speeds. One suggestion was that I go ahead while Cole stays back at camp. He could sleep in and pack up on his own while I hike on ahead not having to worry about “catching up”. We were both up and packing,  but Cole agreed to finish packing the tent on his own and head out about 30 minutes after me. When he caught up to me an hour later he was rather grumpy. I am often confused about what exactly makes him grumpy. Is it a teenage thing?
His waist belt was high on his stomach. I pointed it out to him. 
“It’s more comfortable like this.” he grunted. It looks like Miss Janet’s charms had worn off. 
It was a beautiful day for hiking. Sometimes Cole went ahead and waited for me and sometimes he stayed behind for a bit and socialized with other hikers while I hiked on. 
When we were a couple of miles from the shelter, he went on ahead with instructions to set up the tent. The last few miles are usually the hardest for me. I took my time, rested in the sunshine as often as I pleased, and even stopped to chat with my husband on Facebook. I never know if I will have a signal at camp, so if I get a connection on the trail then  I like to let him know we have made it through the day. 
When I arrived at the shelter, Cole was hanging out with a couple of other hikers that we have interacted with a few times on the trail. He wanted to sleep in the shelter with them and I said that was fine. 
After that, his interpretation and my interpretation of what transpired are rather different. From my perspective, the adult hikers decided to entertain themselves by first teasing me, and when I ignored them they took to mocking a 13 year old instead. The 13 year old, either oblivious or else just wanting to fit in, accepted the treatment. From Cole’s perspective, they were just trying to have fun and, he commented, how is it any different from his friends at home mocking him in jest? I later tried to explain. These are not your peers. These are grown men picking on a kid. I had already given him permission to stay the night in the shelter. What could I do? I knew he wouldn’t see my side and jumping in would just embarrass him and make him angry at me. So, as bad as it felt, I held my tongue, went to the tent and left him to them. What an incredibly hard thing that was to do!","Christmas Tree Campsite

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589190,"Last night I discovered two huge blisters on my feet, one on each heel. I was horrified! Blisters!? With one exception that was foreseen from the start (my baby toe tucks under the toe beside it and this has often caused a small blister) I have been proudly blister free until now! Aren’t the blisters supposed to show up in the first week or two when you are getting accustomed to the trail, or when you discover that your footwear is ill fitting? Why, why have these shown up now? I could only think of two possibilities. My shoulder had been hurting for a few days and so I had been doing a lot of adjusting of my pack trying to shift the weight more onto my hips. Could this also have changed my gait and caused the blisters? Or, could it be that my boots have worn down enough to cause them to rub where they shouldn’t rub. Ugh! 
If feet gross you out, or you aren’t particularly fond of whining, maybe you should stop here for today because I just need to Take a few minutes to lament over my foot ailments. I have muscle pain in my arches, (hence the custom orthotics) bunions and a bunionette, sore toes, and heal pain. My heals get dry easily and then the skin cracks if they are not tended to regularly. And now, blisters! How will these two collapsing cornerstones that are vital to my ability to hike, ever  get me to Katahdin? At the end of each day I hobble around in my camp shoes just trying to get chores done so that I can get off my feet. When I lay down at night I can’t possibly imagine how I will get up and hike again the next day. But, when morning comes, the pain has decreased enough for me to get right back on my feet and do it again. But for how long?
Ok, lament over.
The weather was beautiful again today and I absolutely adored the views leading up to Jane Bald. There were a lot of day hikers out enjoying the view as well. I wonder if they appreciate how fortunate they are to live so close to such a gorgeous hiking spot. 
The beauty of my surroundings and the warmth of the sun were overshadowed by a rumbling cloud that lingered between my son and I. We just weren’t seeing eye to eye. On anything. Is it fair to list my complaints if he isn’t here to list his?  Probably not.
The experience of hiking the AT isn’t just about the trail and the beautiful scenery. It is also about the physical   effects on your body and the interactions with people you meet along the way....or the ones you bring with you. As much as I am trying to allow him to stretch his wings and gain some independence, when push comes to shove he is still only 13 and I am his mother. Sorry bud, you can’t exactly hike your own hike just yet. 
We originally wanted to make it to Overmountain Shelter which is a barn that had been transformed into a shelter. The distance was rather far for us. 17 miles! But wait! Maybe it was only 15. My guide book and my Guthooks app did not agree on the distance. 
When we arrived at Stan Murray Shelter and found it to be completely empty and quiet, we decided it was the place we would stay for the night. I wanted to see the barn and watch the sunset behind the hills, but more importantly, Cole and I needed a quiet place to talk, and this was it.","Clyde Smith Shelter

After 40 days away from family, today was the day we got to see Mark (my husband) and Evan (Cole’s twin brother) Again, the guide book and Guthooks didn’t agree on the distance, but we had come to trust in the app as the more reliable source. We had 11.1 miles between us and our loved ones and we were anxious to cross that distance as quickly as possible. We took the blue blaze to Overmountain Shelter so that I could snap a few photos, then we continued on. The terrain was challenging in places. There was a long windy climb up and across an extensive Bald, and a long rocky section. We came to a sign indicating we had finally left North Carolina for the very last time. (We had been jumping back and forth over the Tennessee/ North Carolina state line. )
We didn’t stop for lunch. We barely even stopped for breaks ( except for when Cole was waiting for me. ) Finally I just told Cole to go on ahead to the road where Mark and Evan were waiting and I would get there as soon as I could. 
About a mile from the road I saw Cole in the distance coming back towards me without his backpack on and with his brother Evan at his side. Shortly thereafter we reached Mark at the roadside. He had been shuttling hikers into town all morning as he waited for us. It was a wonderful reunion and I was ready to spend some time with my family and give my feet a break.

Second, I have noticed that my guide book and my Guthooks app do not always line up. Our miles to date are 394.8. I don’t know if I calculated a distance incorrectly or if one of my resources is to blame. At any rate, I will have to “fudge” some numbers to get the total back on track. (Update; I have added mileage to this entry,even though we didn’t hike, in order to correct the distance total)
Now, what have we been up to?We took two zeros to rest and spend time with our family. Mark brought me everything I needed for a pedicure and I soaked (a lot!) in a warm epsom salt bath. I sure hope you can’t overdose on Epsom salts!! Hubby gave me more than one foot massage, and he also brought me a new pair of boots and and a three man tent to replace our two man tent. Our sleeping space just got a third bigger!
We went to the movies (How could they end the movie that way!!) and we shopped for our Resupply. The guide book said that there would be a festival with vendors, so we returned to Roan Mountain (we stayed in Bristol) to check it out. It was a bust! Not one single vendor was there. We ate cake, lazed around and overdosed on cuddles.  Oh, and I also turned 47!!

",View Entry,"May 05, Sat",2.60
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589748,"Everybody poops. When my boys were little they received a book with a title similar to that. On each page there were pictures of animals out in nature. If you lifted the flap with the picture of the rock on it, underneath you would find the poop. If you slid the slider with the picture of the tree, well behind the tree you would find poop. 
The AT is exactly like that. The difference is, the animals poop smack dab in the middle of the trail...but they are allowed to. It is the humans who do a lousy job of disposing of their waste properly. Putting a rock on it or doing it behind a tree is not proper disposal. Dig a hole. Burry it. 
So, I knew right from the start that I would have to poop when I was out on the AT. Obviously! Everybody poops! But, here is what I thought. I am a very regular predictable pooper. First thing in the morning, I get it done. No problem. Shelters have privys. I’m good to go.
Then day three happened and changed my world.  There was no privy at Lance Creek. But, never mind that. In the evening I ventured way out into the trees with my pee rag to tinkle in private. Unexpectedly and without warning my bowels decided to get in on the purge. I was totally unprepared. No trowel. No TP. Luckily the ground was covered in dried up leaves. They would have to do. I used a stick to attempt a burial, but really it was only half hearted. I was more focused on the dry leaves that were no doubt stuck to my butt and was totally put off and upset by the untimely discharge. Day three and I had already failed at “leave no trace.” 
This of course would not be the first upset to my plans pertaining to pooping in the privies. Even the shelters aren’t guaranteed to have a privy. In the Smokies they really mess you up. At one Shelter you’ll see a sign pointing you to a “toilet area”. This is just a designated pooping place in the trees. You, like a hundred people before you, will want to hide yourself behind some obstacle as you go....a tree, a stump, a bush. But the obstacles are few and the one you pick will undoubtedly have been used before. Maybe the person before you used a trowel and maybe they didn’t. You just never know. 
So you come to dread pooping in the Smokies, but then, low and behold, you come to a shelter in Smokey Mountain National Park that actually has a privy. Not just any privy either. In other places on the trail, some privies have no doors on them. Some have a door that touches your knees if you close it. Not these privies in the Smokies though. They are BIG and spacious. In fact, they have ramps, handle railings and pictorial instructions showing you how to use the privy from your wheel chair. 
Say what!!
Yes indeed, the privies in the Smokies mountains on the Appalachian Trail are wheelchair accessible. Good grief! 
Obviously by now I have come to terms with the fact that I have to put my trowel to use on a regular basis. I’ve even found a method that I feel the most comfortable with. It involves selecting a location where there is a tree strong enough to support my weight but thin enough that I can grasp the trunk firmly with one hand. I dig my hole close by, grasp the tree then squat. (hovering over a hole with my pants down and NOT grasping a tree is just way too precarious) My success rate at actually making it into the hole is actually quite low. A stick will do the trick to roll it into place though (I never use my trowel or boot for poop relocation).  Pooping in the woods is just a natural part of my life now, but you won’t find what I leave behind by lifting a flap or sliding a slide. You’ll have to dig.
Now, you may be wondering what brought on this dirty discourse on dung. 
 Diarrhea.
After two days of rest, Mark drove Cole and I back to where he had dropped us off. It was hard to say goodbye again, especially to my son Evan.
The weather was favourable and the trail was beautiful, but by the afternoon my stomach and my bowels had completely turned against me. I couldn’t dive behind a bush fast enough. Like, mess in the pants not fast enough. Ugh! I cleaned myself up, got back on the trail and almost instantly had to dive behind the bushes again. I was feeling just fine despite having “the trots” as my grandmother would have called it. However after four or five episodes my energy was completely drained.
About two miles from where we intended to stop for the night, we encountered trail magic. A cold soda and a tangerine were a huge blessing at that moment. They gave me the energy I needed to get to camp.
I pulled out my little camping basin and soap, cleaned up my clothes and hung them to dry....right before another emergency dive behind the laurels. Too late! Ugh! Out came the wash basin and Dr Bronners once again.

I am also thankful that my 13 year old son no longer wears children’s underwear. Mine had not dried overnight, so I donned a pair of his hip-less gitch. To get mine dry I attached them to the outside of my pack for the world to see. I am probably now a top runner in the “mom who embarrassed her kid the most” award. Oh wait, I also wrote these embarrassing things down and posted them on a public forum. I’ve got this one hands down!
To decrease weight and eliminate trash, I had not brought the packaging for any of the medications that I had with me. (Stupid!) I had to guess on the dose of the anti diarrhea medication. Now I was stopped up, but also terribly bloated. Agonizingly bloated. I wear leggings with shorts over top when I hike. Plus underwear. Plus my backpack. That made four things wrapped around my circumference and each one felt like a noose trying to squeeze the life out of me. I hiked on anyway. I am not sure how I went eight miles before lunch in that condition , but I did. 
The weather was gorgeous. The scenery was lovely. In the blue sky above us, one dark cloud lingered. Every once in a while we would hear it rumbling. It made me think about the trail. The trail has offered up a wide variety of landscapes for me to enjoy and delight in. The weather has been more than favourable. But, each day there seemed to be something rumbling overhead. Foot pain, moody teen, diarrhea, hunger, thirst, loneliness. Something. What was I going to focus on? The sky full of white clouds or that one dark one making threatening sounds?
When we stopped for lunch we spread the footprint out on the ground and I stretched out on it watching the sky. That dark cloud moved closer. I massaged my abdomen (and thankfully passed some gas) and began to feel much better. That darn cloud was going to have none of letting me do that! 
Drip. 
We pulled out our lunch and devoured it.
Drip. Drip.
I put my head down on my bag and closed my eyes to rest. 
Drip. Drip. Drip.
Fine! We packed up and got moving again. Eventually we moved beyond the reach of that insulting cloud. Temporarily.
The trail had some surprises for us. Delightful ones. There were beautiful pink flowers and a flowing river that we hiked along side and crossed multiple times. I love the sound of moving water. Hiking beside it or sleeping next to it lifts my spirits. 
A steep trail of rocks led us down to Laurel falls. By then that nasty cloud had caught up to me. I tried to move faster. At one point the path led straight to a wall of rock. There was a blaze on the rock so I knew I was in the right spot. But, where was I supposed to go? Then I saw the narrow ledge along the rock wall that followed the river. I was supposed to walk along that!!!Exciting!
Cole had gone ahead and had the tent set up when I arrived at the shelter. I tried to dive in head first to get out of the rain, forgetting about the big lump on my back. Cole was unimpressed when my backpack started to tip the tent and I got a bit of a scolding. Aren’t I the parent here?

After taking two zeros on the weekend, we began running in to people who we hadn’t seen for a while. We also encountered many new faces. 
When we arrived at a road that led to Boots Off hostel we decided to drop in for a soda. There we found even more hikers that we knew, ones we had assumed were far up the trail ahead of us. A food truck arrived and that delayed us longer. We joked that it definitely wasn’t a “fast food” truck because there was a long wait. However, it was good to have a rest and when the food eventually came, it was delicious. 
We set out again with full bellies! The trail brought us around a lake, through a closed off area of forest, (closed due to bear activity. Only AT hikers were allowed through. I guess that we smell so bad that the bears don’t bother us), over a dam, and then up a mountain (of course). At times the water was plentiful, but as we began to climb that mountain in the afternoon heat, the water disappeared fast, both in our bottles and in the availability of resupply sources.  By the time we reached a spring at mile 435.5 we were both dehydrated. With a decent water source at hand, a flat(ish) spot for the tent and the company of a handful of other parched souls who had also stopped there, what more did we need? We decided to call it a day.","

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590091,"16.1 miles!! That is a record for us. I really hadn’t intended to go that far. Cole really wanted to get to the shelter. I know that he has his own motives and they have nothing to do with concern for his mother’s energy level or sore feet.
“I want to see if I can make it 16 Miles” he said. Well of course he can. We both know it, and I am not pushing myself beyond what I feel comfortable with just so you can prove something we both already know. We both already knew the real reason he wanted to get there too...to socialize with the other people we knew would be there. I wasn’t pushing myself for that purpose either...but we did end up going the distance.
The day was overcast and drizzly, but it kept the temperature down and thirst at bay. The terrain levelled off a lot by lunch time, and although my feet did their usual complaining, the miles were a bit easier.
During one pause for rest, Cole said to me, “I feel much better when I drink a  lot of water and take time to rest.”
Wait! What? Can you repeat that please? Has it only taken 47 days and over 400 miles for this self realization? Have I not been telling you this exact thing? 
Sigh!
This is what I have discovered about parenting a teen. You can tell him something over and over until you are blue in the face, but until he comes to the realization of it on his own, it just won’t sink in. 
Sometimes the scenery on the AT stays the same for long periods of time. But, at other times the AT surprises and delights you by taking you someplace different. Today it took us straight through a farmer’s field. Through one section we had to unlatch the gate to enter. It felt a little bit like trespassing. Through another section, occupied by grazing cows, there was actually a step in place so that we could climb over the fence. What an amazing thing for a landowner to do, to allow AT hikers to traverse his field, especially when it is occupied by cows! This is what I love about the AT! The variety in the landscapes and the community of people who love and support it. What I don’t like at all are those who abuse it...and sadly, there are a lot of them!","Spring at mile 435.5

We stopped at Abington Gap Shelter for lunch along with a few other hikers (Dunk, Egg, Amazonian, Francis and Matt). We rested for a long time during the hottest part of the day. 
Both of our sawyer water collection bags have holes in them now. Duct tape isn’t cutting it but we are making them do. We are also down a water bottle. One got left behind in the van when Mark dropped us off on Monday. The next water source was eight miles away which would put us at another sixteen mile day. Ugh. I just didn’t think I could do it. 
After our rest, I started out from the shelter before everyone else. I am slow and was certain that they would all pass me. And they did. It is really nice being ahead of Cole for a change. I like it a lot! He must have stayed resting at the shelter for a long time because it took two hours for him to catch up to me. By that time my energy was almost spent. Clouds were moving in and the air had cooled a lot so we were not going through our water as quickly. Cole really wanted to  get to the campsite at the next water source. His motive was predictable. Everyone was going there. I noticed on Guthooks that there was a small campsite by the Virginia border and so I let him know that I really needed to stop there.
Cole tried everything. 

If it is a small campsite, our tent probably won’t fit.

-What about water. Don’t we need some? 

It is ONLY going to be another mile or two. 

None of these attempts succeeded in increasing my energy level or soothing my feet. So, when we reached the border, we stopped for the night.

Once inside the tent, Cole just wanted to go to bed without eating.
 I waited for the rain to stop then went outside, strung a clothesline and hung our wet things. I fixed a wrap for Cole and convinced him to eat it.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590937,"It is so easy to Resupply when the trail runs straight through a town. We arrived in Damascus to a town wide garage sale. The sidewalks and the park were packed with people. Every third or fourth house had a yard full of stuff for sale. 
In the centre of town we stopped so that I could use the public washroom. When I came back out, Cole was standing there looking very awkward and uncomfortable as a gentleman was trying to make conversation with him. I stepped in and continued the discourse with the fellow who was simply inquiring about our hike. Once we got moving  again, Cole said, 
“I think that when we come into a town, there are three kinds of people that we find. There are the people who avoid us because we look funny and smell bad. There are people who just treat us like everyone else. Then there are the people who are overly interested in what we are doing and they want to be friendly and chat.”
Then he added, “I would feel more comfortable if they all just avoided us because we smell.”
I find this interesting because when we come in to camp in the late afternoon all he wants to do is socialize with whoever is there. He dislikes it when we don’t camp with other people. Maybe he feels awkward around “non hikers” because he knows he stands out and....yes we smell. With other hikers we don’t have to be concerned about this because we all look funny and reek together.
We found our way to Subway to eat. We had spent the entire week rationing our toilet paper. My bout of diarrhea on Monday had seriously depleted our stash. When we got to the subway, I was ecstatic to use the washroom and use as much toilet paper as I felt necessary to get the job done properly. No more alternating between leaves and paper in order to stretch the supply further. 
In addition to food, we had a list of things we needed to pick up in town, so when our bellies were full I popped in to the outfitters next door. Just inside the door was a hiker box. At the top of the box was a brand new still in the plastic role of toilet paper. Score! Isn’t life funny sometimes. 
That night we stayed at a church run hostel called The Place. 
For a few weeks now I’ve had a blemish on my face near my nose. No big deal. Rosacea is a regular occurring thing that I deal with. However, this blemish isn’t going away, and it is growing. I am becoming concerned. Late in the day I was chatting with a lady at the hostel who mentioned that she is a nurse. I asked her to look at the blemish. She recommended that I see a doctor because it looks infected and she feels  I need a prescription antibiotic. Oh dear! By now everything in Damascus was closed. Our next town stop is in Marion about five days away. I will have to figure out how to get help there.","TN-VA Border
",Damascus,"May 12, Sat",3.50
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590943,"Cole was feeling the weight of his pack this morning, even though we had one day less food. Admittedly I did stock up on a lot of snacks. If I fill his pockets full of food he will snack all day. 
He took out a cliff bar, unwrapped it and didn’t quite make it to his mouth before he dropped it onto the ground.
“I am not eating that”, he quickly pronounced.
Obviously I fed him too much in town. 
I gave him mine which was still in the wrapper and tucked his into my hip pouch (and devoured it later in the day, dirt and all.)
 At first I thought Cole was going to hike with me, but he must have found his mojo because soon after, he was racing up the trail. 
We followed along in the same direction as the Virginia Creeper Trail and could often see it and people riding bikes along it from the AT. We could hear the river all morning and in some sections of the trail we came down along side it. It was a warm day and all I could think about was how wonderful it would be to put my feet in that water. 
By the time Cole was searching out a spot for us to have lunch, the river was far below us out of reach. We were contemplating aiming for the next shelter to spend the night but my feet didn’t like that idea. Searching for an alternative stopping point, I noticed on Guthooks that the AT met back up with The Creeper Trail down by the river! Woohoo! We found a fantastic campsite right along the river beside a bridge. There was already a handful of hikers set up there. I couldn’t get my shoes and sox off fast enough! It was cold, but the water felt oh so good! There were no Mother’s Day gifts, no hugs or kisses, not even a “Happy Mother’s Day Mom” from the teen I was adventuring with, but there was a perfectly situated rock to sit on and a lovely cold river in which to soak my weary feet. Sometimes you just have to put on a happy face and find joy in what you’ve got. 
Someone got a campfire blazing, so when my feet turned purple from being in the cold water for so long I joined the hikers who were by the fire and warmed my tootsies back up. I picked the brains of our camping companions too, trying to find out if they have “walk in clinics” here like they do at home in Canada, and about how much it costs. The answers ranged from $60 to $150. Of course, I still have to find one and figure out how I am going to get there. It probably isn’t worth the amount of concern I am attaching to it. It might mean taking an extra day away from the trail. No big deal. Right?

",Unmarked Campsite Mile 483.6,"May 13, Sun",13.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590948,"In the morning I was packed and ready ahead of Cole. I left him to finish up and I went on ahead.  There was a lot of climbing to do! It took Cole 3.5 hours to catch up to me, an unusually long time considering that it normally only takes him about an hour.
A number of water sources were turning up dry, but Guthooks showed a piped spring that looked promising. It was gushing! Although there was no shade to hide from the sun that was beating down on us, the presence of water and the gorgeous view made it the perfect stop for lunch. A dozen or more other parched hikers thought so as well. What a great opportunity for the “hiker express” to pass information along the trail. The word was that the shelter we had intended to stop at, Thomas Knob Shelter, had a large aggressive bear nearby pulling food bags out of trees at night. Some people were planning to head for a campsite a mile past the shelter while others were going to stop before. I had no idea yet what we were going to do. 
I filled my little wash basin with cold water from the pipe and soaked my feet while Cole tried unsuccessfully to rig a make shift shade cover using our fly and trekking poles.
After a lengthy rest we got moving again. Less than an hour down the trail we encountered trail magic! All of the hikers who had just eaten lunch with us were spread out on the grass refueling some more. This time they were fuelling up, not on trail food but on fresh fruit, sodas and sandwiches. 
As it turned out, this “trail magic” was the very best blessing and answer to prayer that I have received on the trail. The woman doing the trail magic was a family doctor. She had a big box of medical supplies with her. She numbed the sore on my face so that she could open it up and remove the “ick” inside. She put some antibiotic cream on it and gave me a small container with more. She also wrote two prescriptions for me in case the cream was not enough. One prescription was for more antibiotic cream and one was for an oral antibiotic. On top of all of that she gave me a few pills in case we got Noro virus ( An illness common on the trail, usually spread on the water or hiker to hiker contact) I honestly just felt like crying with gratitude. My heart sung!!!
We lingered for a long while but eventually started moving again. There was still the question of where we would spend the night. We did not feel like adding to our distance by going past the shelter. A few in the group we had been enjoying the trail magic with were headed for a Bald before the shelter. We headed there too. We were the last to arrive. In the Bald there were wild ponies grazing. They took quite an interest in the bunch of smelly hikers who had set up camp in their meadow. In fact, they rather liked our stench...or at least the salt on our skin that the sweat produced. They kept trying to lick us. Cole had fun  chasing them away from the tents before they eventually decided to wander off.
We had a stunning view of the sky as the sun set, displaying a rich array of oranges and yellows. As we sat there dazzled by the beauty, Cole commented “ A lot of the time it seems like we are in a post card, doesn’t it.
“Yes sweetie, it sure does.”","Unmarked Campsite Mile 483.6

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590952,"Miles I took off ahead of Cole again this morning. He caught up rather quickly and I was glad because we were soon to come upon a milestone that I wanted him with me for.....the 500 mile mark. I  can hardly believe that we have hiked 500 miles! 
We would also be entering Grayson Highlands State Park. There are wild ponies in the park, but as we discovered yesterday, there are also wild ponies outside of the park. 
A fun obstacle that we went through today was “Fatman squeeze” which is a rock tunnel through which the AT runs.
I was very slow going through Grayson Highlands and beyond. The trail was very rocky. There were big rocks to climb, medium rocks to hop across and small rocks to walk along. All of them are hard on my feet and slow me down a lot. By the time we stopped for lunch at Wise Shelter, we had only gone six miles. Granted we did stop a lot to pet the ponies, but not in the Park. It is illegal to pet them in the park, so I was glad that we encountered them elsewhere. 
Rain was forecast in the afternoon so I hustled out of Wise Shelter as fast as I could. Cole was letting me lead again. The sky rumbled. It dripped. Then it down-poured and I was out of steam. Going faster was no longer going to keep me dry anyway so I slowed to my regular pace. 
Cole eventually caught up. He had stopped for water but had also taken a wrong turn and had to backtrack a little. I told him to hurry on ahead to the next shelter to get out of the rain. 
When I arrived, he had set up the tent during a lull in the rain. I crashed on my bed  at 7pm. We hadn’t really hiked all that far, but I was just so tired and the pitter patter of the rain on the tent lulled me to sleep.","Bald near mile 497.4

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590956,"20 miles! Wow! I can’t believe that we hiked 20 miles today. We hadn’t planned to do 20 miles when we started out. You just never know what the day will bring when you head out on the AT. 
I got a head start. As I headed down the trail I was thinking about my stomach. I had just eaten breakfast and my tummy was still rumbling. 
About fifteen minutes into my hike,  a gentleman came around the corner towards me. 
“Whoa! Oh you’re not a bear!” He exclaimed.
“No, I am not a bear” I replied, and I was glad that I wasn’t as I spied a gun on his hip. 
“Have you seen any bears?” He asked.
“No, I haven’t.”
“Ok, I have a few questions for you.”
“Alright” I said, thinking that this encounter was rather odd. 
“Are you hungry?”
“A little bit” ( a lot really!)
“Are you a vegetarian?”
This did not look like a trail angel. He looked more like a day hiker hunting bears. But, I just went with it anyway.
“No, I’m not a vegetarian.”
“I have a sausage and cheese sandwich if you would like it.”
Was this his own food that he was offering me?
“I wouldn’t want to take your food from you.” I replied.
“It is ok. I am looking to lighten my load.”
“Ok then,” I said and my tummy rumbled. 
He took his backpack off, pulled out a tinfoil packet and unwrapped a tasty looking bun with sausage and cheese on it. I took one bite and my taste buds danced. It was so good! The bun was soft, the cheese was slightly melted, the sausage had just the right amount of spice to it and the whole thing was delightfully warm. 
He asked me a few more questions and then sent me on down to the Gap where his truck was parked with a cooler full of drinks and clementines. He had lawn chairs set out and a garbage bag to collect hiker’s trash. It seems that trail angels can come in all different packages.
As I sat there eating my clementine I kept thinking, hurry Cole, hurry Cole. I didn’t want him to miss out on a breakfast sandwich. No worries! He made it! He was the third after me. 
It was drizzling as we continued on after our second magical breakfast. Then it was pouring. And pouring. It rained and poured all day long. In about two hours, water was sloshing around inside my boots and the inside of my rain coat was just as wet as the outside. It was too wet to stop so we just kept moving and moving. 
Around lunch time we came upon a road crossing. There was a sign board that had a very narrow roof over it. There was just enough room for us to squeeze under the overhang to have our lunch. As we ate, we watched a pair of hikers trying to catch a hitch.  Another group of would be hitchhikers showed up and decided to try their chances further up the road. This coming weekend is Trail days in Damascus and a lot of hikers are trying to hitchhike back. 
As we started to pack up, a truck pulled up and a gentleman got out and offered us candy. In everyday life, this would seem like a really weird creepy thing, but not when you are hiking the AT! Cole filled his pockets with a variety of fun sized candy bars and then we were back on the trail out in the rain. 
The destination was Trumpi Shelter. This would put us 10 miles from Partnership Shelter where we could get a bus into Marion to Resupply. However, the shuttle only came three times a day and if we wanted to get back out of town the same day, we would have to arrive early in the day. If we could hike past Trumpi Shelter, we could reduce the miles we would have to go the next morning and increase our chance of getting an early shuttle. We were already soaking wet. Would a little more rain really matter?
I told my idea to Cole. He wasn’t overly thrilled but he said he would hike further. 
When we arrived at Trumpi Shelter there were only three people there, Dunk, Egg and Not Doc. Cole was having second thoughts about more hiking. The shelter had an upper bunk and Cole had his eyes set on it. 
Let me rest for an hour, I said, then we will decide what to do. 
At 4:45 I was feeling rested and ready to hike more. I told Cole to give me a 30 minute head start, then back out into the rain I went. 
After about fifteen minutes the rain stopped and the next four miles were the most enjoyable of my day. Most of what I had seen while it was raining was my feet. Now I saw trees and sky and the occasional change in the landscape. I went through another cow pasture. The cows watched as I trespassed. It just tickles me pink when we get to go through cow occupied pastures. (Navigating around the manure piles doesn’t bother me one bit.)
I crossed a quaint picture perfect bridge and a nice long stretch of flat ground. 
After four miles, Cole caught up to me.....with no rain jacket!
“Um, where is your rain jacket bud?”
It was at Trumpi Shelter.
It was getting late in the day and the sun would soon be going down. It was too late to go back for it. We hoped that Dunk and Egg would spot it and bring it.
We hiked two more miles making our total 20 for the day. Then we pitched our tent and called it a night just as it started to rain once again! ","Old Orchard Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590955,"In the morning we discussed a few options for getting Cole’s raincoat back. Option 1: carry on to Marion and hope Dunk and Egg pick it up. Option 2: Cole hikes back to get it. I carry on to Partnership Shelter to rest ( I was totally spent after our 20 mile day) and we go into Marion tomorrow. Option 3: Cole goes back for the coat, I continue to Marion to Resupply without him and we meet back at Partnership Shelter. This way we don’t lose a day of hiking. We discussed the pros and cons of each option and in the end decided that we should stay together and go forward hoping that our friends would pick it up. 
The four miles to Partnership Shelter was slow. I had a blister from hiking in wet footwear. We had dry sox on today and plastic bags on our feet in our shoes. The forecast was for rain but thankfully the sun was shining brightly. 
We reached Partnership Shelter, caught the bus at the visitor centre just beyond it, resupplied at Walmart, ate pizza and returned by shuttle to Partnership Shelter. There is a shower at the shelter. A very cold shower. I took one anyway.....with my clothes on. Yes, seriously I did that. I just smelled so badly! I stood by the campfire for a while afterwards to get dry.
The shelter began to fill up. Pizza was ordered ( It is one of the only shelters on the AT that you can order pizza from) and alcohol appeared. Unfortunately Partnership Shelter is also a party shelter, but there was just no way I could hike seven more miles to the next shelter. 
Oh, I almost forgot! Before we boarded the shuttle bus, Dunk and Egg arrived. They had hustled! Guess what they had.....Cole’s rain coat! What a relief!","

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591486,"It rained all night last night and it wasn’t letting up in the morning. We decided to hike in our underwear and rain pants. Rain geAr is like a sauna suit. Maybe it keeps the rain off of you, but you end up soaked from sweat. This way we would stay cooler and keep our pants dry inside our backpacks.
The first section that we hiked was steep and rocky. 
Rain. Rocks. Rain. Rocks. 
I had to find something to look forward to and focus on it. The Schoolhouse! I had seen online that the one room Lindamood School was open to hikers and full of trail magic. If we could make it there we could take a nice long break in a dry place. 
Rain. Rocks.
I had wrapped plastic bags around my insoles to try to fend off the slushing inside my boots. It delayed it, but eventually I was sloshing again.
When the rocks ended the streams began. Numerous flowing streams would normally delight me with their rhythmic music. Today, it was just more water to me, and lots of it. The streams were flowing high and spilling over their banks. Would be stepping stones used to aid in  crossing were now submerged. 
Slosh slosh slosh
We came upon Chatfield Shelter and rushed over to it for a brief reprieve from the endless pitter patter on our heads. It was a very small shelter and even though it was barely past noon, inside were hikers who were staying for the night. They did not want dripping intruders getting their space wet. 
We rested briefly then moved on.
Then finally...the school house. It was stocked with snacks, cold drinks, toiletries, first aid supplies, and anything you could think of that a hiker might need.  Cole snacked and snacked. I changed my clothes so I would be dry and warm and took off my boots and sox. We stayed for a long time! 
I had accidentally left my bandana at Partnership Shelter. There was one in the box at the school!! Score!
While we were there, a couple from the church who provides the trail magic stopped by to Refill the supplies. It was nice to be able to thank them in person.
Eventually we gathered ourselves back together, put our wet gear back on and headed out. The rain had let up.
The next section of the trail traversed fields, a highway, and a cow pasture. Cole decided to stay with me as we hiked this section. We shared some laughs, mostly centred on my missing bandana. Why? Well because the bandana has been my “pee rag” .  We made up stories about where it could be and how it might have gotten there. When you have been hiking in the rain all day, laughter is a good uplifter, even if it is over something silly like a missing pee rag.
On the far side of the cow pasture there was a very small campsite just waiting for us. I hung wet clothes on a line in an attempt to dry them out, but was soon rushing to pull them off the line again as the skys let loose on us once more.","Partnership Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591489,"When you find yourself pulling on cold wet smelly clothing in the morning, you know for certain that you have become hiker trash! At least we both had dry pants available since we had hiked in our rain pants yesterday. It seemed like it might rain again, so I started out in my rain pants, but quickly changed to shorts as the day warmed up. Although it wasn’t raining, the trail was a wet mess.  Even if we had started the day out with dry feet, they probably would not have stayed that way for long. At least that is what I kept saying to console myself. My new boots just weren’t keeping the water out like their predecessors had in their prime. 
The forecast was calling for thunderstorms, but sunshine was breaking in through the trees. I wanted to focus on the scenery, I really did, but one thought just distracted me all day. Find an open area to dry your feet! Find an open area to dry your feet! 
We hustled along until past noon trying to find an open area. When we did find it, it was occupied by cows. One particular cow was chewing the grass right beside the AT.  It stopped eating and looked up at us as we approached. It wasn’t your typical black and white jersey cow like you might see on a milk commercial. He was grey, stern faced and had horns atop his head. He looked mean...and stubborn. 
We stopped. I wasn’t too thrilled about passing him. 
“I know that this is your pasture cow, but could you please just move along, move along, move along.”
He continued to stare, but resumed chewing his mouth full of grass.
When he was done, he slowly turned and moved along. 
It began to drizzle before we finished crossing the pasture and I thought we had lost our opportunity to dry out. The sky rumbled a bit but failed to follow up its threats with any kind of real action. Soon the sun was out again and what do ya know....another cow pasture. No cows were in sight. We spread out our footprint, threw off our footwear, spread out everything we had that was damp, drenched, or somewhere in between, and then we laid down and had a nice long rest while our clothes dried.
The sun was bright, and  the clouds were few. Everything dried quickly. Cole dozed off and time marched on. 
Not far from us a “rock” that I had been staring at twitched its ear.  A cow was napping with us too!
Eventually the cow got up and moved on and so did we. Convinced that the threat of thunderstorms had passed, we sauntered on a few more miles towards the next shelter. 
That is when the AT laughed at us and our foolish notion of ever being dry.
One mile from the shelter it began to sprinkle. 
A half mile from the shelter the skys let loose and dumped everything they had on us. Every bit of me was soaking wet and my boots were sloshing once again.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591571,"Last night Cole wasn’t feeling well. He didn’t want to eat dinner and he didn’t even want to socialize by the shelter. This morning he was reluctant to get out of bed. 
Lately our morning routine has looked like this. I wake up and start packing up my things. Cole gets up, gets dressed and goes to retrieve the food from the tree it was hung in the night before. (What else would a 13 year old have on his mind first thing in the morning besides food!) While he eats, I pack up his bag for him, making sure that dry things are where they will stay dry. Then I quickly eat my breakfast and head out leaving him to pack up the tent.
This morning I got myself dressed  and retrieved the food. I ate my breakfast then packed my bag. Cole was still in bed. I coaxed him to get moving and made him pull the plug on his air mattress before I headed out (to discourage him from crawling back into bed after I left).
I have never left him behind with so much still to do to get ready. It made me a bit nervous. What would he forget to do? Would he leave anything behind?
As wet as everything had been yesterday, it was nothing compared to today. The streams were wider, deeper and harder to cross. In some places the stream had taken over the trail. Each hiker I came across had a different approach to tackling these obstacles. One just waded on through the water shoes and all. One removed her sox and shoes. One bushwhacked up stream to get to an easier crossing point. One took a road around missing an entire mile of the AT. One actually took the time to try to move things to make stepping stones....that one was my son. It is no wonder then that he took a very long time to catch up to me today. I almost thought that perhaps he had gone back to sleep. But nope, he had gotten himself up and moving and hadn’t left anything behind.
We had a long ascent around lunch time and eventually came out into a clearing on Chestnut Ridge. There were fluffy white clouds in the sky and the sun was shining once again. Rain was in the forecast. Dare we try to get dried out?
Cole was still not feeling like his usual energetic self and he wanted to rest. He also said that his toes hurt. Once again we pulled out the footprint,  threw off our boots and spread out our wet smelly things. Cole laid down to nap and I took a good look at his feet. He had a rash all along the tops of his toes on both of his feet. He said that they weren’t itchy and I saw no blisters, so I ruled out poison ivy. Still, I didn’t know what it was. Could hiking in wet footwear day after day cause that?
We were near a pond. Cole napped while I sat listening to croaking frogs and worrying about him. 
When we finally got moving again, neither of us had much motivation. We passed Chestnut Knob Shelter hoping to go a few more miles. Cole’s toes hurt. When the sky threatened us with a rumble we quickly called it a day and set up the tent having only hiked 11.2  miles.","Knot Maul Branch Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591575,"By the morning Cole was feeling much better. His toes did not look as red and he said that they did not hurt any more.  He was up and out of bed early and anxious to get hiking once again. I have a notion that he took in a little too much sun yesterday and possibly even burned  his toes.
You would never guess what was in the forecast. Thunderstorms! The sun was shining brightly, but by now we knew not to trust in that as an indicator. The weather seems to change quickly on the AT.
Foolishly we had not paid attention to our water resources the night before. We’ve had so much of it around us for so long that I neglected to check. Now we were up on a ridge line and there would be no drinking water for six miles. 
It was a long dry six miles.
We came to a road crossing with a car parked at it. Trail Magic? No such luck. However there was a garbage can. Being able to unload our garbage is a kind of trail magic too. This time it came with a hitch. There was a second garbage can with a note on it asking us to carry a bag of wood chips from the can to the privy at the next shelter. I guess that is a small price to pay for being able to get rid of our trash. I filled up one of the bags provided with wood chips and attached it to my pack.
When I reached the water source, Cole had already filled his bottle and guzzled half a litre of water. I did the same. We rested and snacked, then I headed on while he rested some more. There was a shelter less than two miles away. It was too early to stop for the day, but it would make a good place to have lunch.
The sky grumbled over head. Rehydrated and energy renewed, I kicked it into high gear and headed for that shelter as fast as my legs could take me. At this point my boots had mostly dried out, except for the toe box on my right foot which seems to be perpetually wet. As I raced on I just kept thinking..dry feet, dry feet, I need dry feet.  Thankfully the pains in my feet have actually diminished. However, when my feet are wet, a new form of foot pain takes over and makes it’s way right down to the bone. It is a miserable ache! I need dry feet! 
I must have been flying awfully fast because Cole didn’t even catch up to me before I reached Jenkins Shelter.
Not  long after Cole arrived behind me, the rain and thunder came.  Other hikers arrived and decided to spend the night. Not us. When the storm seemed to let up, we hit the trail again. Our determination to go further was not without motivation. About 11 miles away was a deli. The closer we got to it, the sooner we would be able to eat something other than trail food.
It sprinkled a bit, but mostly the rain held off. We made it to the intersection of the AT and Trail Boss Trail before calling it a day. 
In the evening after dinner I usually work on writing my journal. Cole will socialize or play on his iPod. Today we were camped alone and the iPod battery was dead. Before we had left for our hike, I had taught Cole how to French braid hair. He was not really thrilled about learning, but I tried to convince him that it would make him a hit with girls. Well, I guess he must have been pretty bored because he asked, “Can I practice braiding your hair?”
I love having my hair braided so of course I didn’t say no. Three times he braided and unbraided my hair, and the last time I kept it in.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591589,"Five miles. That is what stood between us and a hamburger. I was on the trail by 7:30 and Cole followed shortly thereafter. The terrain was favourable to us and by 9:45 we arrived at Brushy Mountain Outpost. The question was, would they cook hamburgers for us at 9:45am?
They did! Delicious burgers! Cole had an ice cream cone once he had finished his burger. It had two huge scoops of black cherry ice cream on it. He was all smiles! Sometimes he is easy to please. 
I am not sure if that was our second breakfast or our lunch, but we marched on until mid afternoon before our tummies rumbled again. We laid down on our footprint in an insect infested campsite to have a snack. Cole doesn’t like bugs. REALLY doesn’t like bugs. He doused himself with bug spray but that didn’t really keep them at bay. There was a swarm of flies busy buzzing around something nearby. Ugh! Someone had pooped right in the campsite. Cole got a stick and flung it away. The flies followed.
 A flying thing with oversized wings danced along Cole’s back while I watched it. Then it rounded his head and flew into his face sending him jumping and flapping to get it away. When he returned to the footprint, a long worm shaped creature with multiple legs had taken up residence in his spot. I gave it a flick. Not the best of spots to take a break. Then I noted a Guthooks entry that someone had written about the site: 
“This Campsite is not optimal unless you want 1000 millipedes and spiders all over you and your gear.” I guess we should have read that first! We moved on.
Rain was in the forecast...but you probably already guessed that. I wasn’t in the mood to rush, so I went at my usual speed and took in my surroundings. I never really noticed how much racket I make trekking along the trail. It is hard to hear the beautiful symphony of sounds that the forest produces when my pole are clacking and my feet are stomping and my backpack is rustling. Today I stopped and listened. I don’t know the names of the various birds that were calling out, each with their own distinct voice. Nor could I identify the bugs that buzzed or even what kind of critters were clicking and clacking in the distance. If I had a working knowledge of musical terms I might be able to describe the entire ensemble much more creatively, but I cant. It will just have to be sufficient to say that it was a beautiful melody. 
I stopped for a few other things today too. For a butterfly that couldn’t decide which flower made the perfect perch, so she had to try out them all. For a snake that stretched himself right across the trail and wasn’t bothered enough by my presence to move. For a pair of dung Beatles who were rolling their little ball of treasure straight down the middle of the AT. I wonder if they were headed for Katahdin. 
I arrived at Jenny Knob Shelter about twenty minutes after the rain started. It graciously let up long enough for us to cook and eat our dinner, then it pittered and pattered on the roof of the tent all night long.","Trail Boss Trail Intersection

I called myself a hiker, but I knew nothing about walking 8-12-16 miles day after day after day.
Yes, I would say, I have backpacked before. But what did I know about dwindling my backpack down to the lightest, most essential of items and living with nothing else for months on end? Nothing! 
I am smarter than I was before.
Everybody passes me. I thought it was because I am old. Then older people passed me.  I thought it was because I was a little overweight. Then heavier people passed me too. 
I feel so slow when people pass me, but I don’t speed up for them. I listen to my body.

Hurry up Sheila, it is going to rain.
Hurry up Sheila and get to the privy.
Hurry up Sheila, there is Trail Magic. 
And sometimes still...
Hurry up Sheila, Cole is waiting. 
I can’t completely let go of that one just yet. 
Still, I am faster than I was before.
I cry.
When my feet are sopping wet and ache down to the bone, I cry. But they hurt less now than they did, and I am stronger than I was before.
When I wake up in the middle of the night because my muscles are screaming in pain, I cry. But they ache less now than they once did, and I am stronger now than I was before.
When I’m blanketed in exhaustion and we have more miles to go and I just can’t seem to catch up to Cole, I cry. But now I can last longer, I can go further, I have more confidence in Cole and I am stronger now than I was before.
When something beautiful, like a view of the mountains or a colourful sunset, makes a dramatic appearance, I cry.
When prayers are answered and my needs are met in surprising ways, I cry.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592303,"Yesterday we had a lovely relaxing day at Lickskillet Hostel. It is an old church being used as a donation based hostel. It is a work in progress for sure, but nothing could beat the hospitality of our host, Mongo. He even bbq’d us a steak dinner with shrimp, salad and garlic bread. I don’t think he does that every day, but we were sure thrilled and appreciative. 
This morning we were driven back to the trail head. We did a bit of math and decided that if we are going to reach Katahdin by the time we have to leave the US, then we have to pick up the pace at bit.  So, we will be aiming to do 14-16 miles a day now. I hope that I can handle it.
In the morning we crossed a suspension bridge. On the other side of the bridge a gentleman stopped us to ask if we needed anything. We said no but stayed and chatted with him for a short bit. Then he asked again. Are you sure you don’t need anything? Do you need a ride to Trent’s Grocery store. 
We had intended to walk there anywayso we went ahead and accepted his offer. Trent’s grocery store is a small gas station convenience store, but they also have a little bit deli. Our thoughts were set on burgers.
Ya know, I weighed myself at the hostel. I don’t know what I started the trail at, but I do know what I was in Hot Springs and I have only lost 2.5 pounds since then. I wonder why? Let’s see, a burger two days ago, a big steak dinner yesterday, another burger today. Nope, don’t have a clue why the pounds aren’t falling off faster! Oh, by the way, have you tried M and M almonds?  They’re great!!
Ok, not everything I eat is junk, but if I feel like packing out that Dairy Milk Fruit and Nut Bar, then I do. I am just always hungry and for the first time in a long time I don’t feel guilty about eating chocolate! What a sweet reward for hiking my butt off!
Trent’s burgers were fine, but not as awesome as the one two days ago.
Afterwards we walked the half mile back to the trail head and resumed our hike. 
The weather was lovely and the terrain was favourable. There is a fable that experienced thru hikers like to pass on to newbies. I had found out about it while researching the AT, so I knew enough not to fall for it when it was passed on to me. The fable is that Virginia is flat. Don’t believe it. We have climbed many steep mountains in Virginia. However a good long stretch of our hike today actually was relatively flat.  There were rocks and muddy bogs, roots, blow downs and all of the usual obstacles, but not much in the way of climbing until the very end of the day. In the last two miles we ascended a big hill. At mile 620 I collapsed into an exhausted pile and that is where we called it a day. Someone on Guthooks had noted that there was a good view of the sunrise from here, but all I saw were trees.","

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592531,"What makes a teenager moody? I’d really like to know. Cole has had a lot of really positive days lately. He smiles when he is in a good mood and I love his smile. When I am ahead and I hear him coming up behind and I see that smile getting closer, it makes me happy. But today that moody switch was flipped and all I saw were frowns. When I told him that we were going to just get into Pearisburg, Resupply and get back out, that made him grumpier. He had assumed that we were going to stay in town.
Thanks to a Guthooks user comment, I knew that once we reached the road to Pearisburg we would turn right and .8 of a mile down the road we would come to a Dairy Queen. Food Lion would be right across the road.
There is a lot of time during the day to contemplate things while hiking. Today my brain was preoccupied by Dairy Queen. 
I grew up in a small town in Ontario. It was a touristy town in the summer and although it didn’t have much to offer in the way of fast food, it did have a small Dairy Queen that opened up for a few months in the warm weather. There were no burgers or fries. Just ice cream. We didn’t have much money to spare on ice cream, but a couple of times each summer we would be able to go to the Dairy Queen for a cone. I liked mine dipped in butterscotch coating. If you got the right server, she might even dip it twice. My sister preferred the wrapped dilly bars out of the display case in the front of the counter. All of the fancier frozen treats, the more expensive ones, were normally not an option for us. Except for once. I don’t know what the occasion was, but it must have been a very rare occurrence because it sticks out clearly in my mind. My mom drove us down to the Dairy Queen and let us pick what we wanted. I got a banana split. When I get back home from Katahdin I will have to ask my mother if she remembers what the occasion was that warranted such a treat.
Of course, I’ve had many banana splits since then. When I discovered that you can even customize your banana split the way you want it, my fondness of them increased dramatically. I am not a fan of the chocolate sauce you see, but I really like the pineapple topping. 
I was pondering all of this as I hiked and I had my tastebuds all worked up for a banana split...one banana cut in half, three little mountains of ice cream, one topped with strawberries and two with pineapple, and whipped topping smothering it all.
We were not far from the road. Cole was ahead. From the distance I saw him sitting on a perfect Little Rock perch waiting for me. As soon as he saw me coming he picked up his seat pad and began to stuff it away.
“Oh don’t put that away yet please,” I said, “I need to rest for a bit.”
He continued stuffing it away and retorted. “We need to keep moving. I don’t want to be hiking past 8pm.”
“Well I guess that you should have picked a younger hiking partner.” I responded as I sat down anyway. And then I added, “But I know how to save us some time. We just won’t stop at Dairy Queen.”
“We were going to stop at Dairy Queen?”
“Yup.”
Did I just loose the banana split I had been dreaming about all day? I think I did. 
After my moment of rest, we carried on together. Cole said nothing.
At the road, two  hikers were waiting for a shuttle. We chatted briefly and I told them that we were headed to the Food Lion.
“There is a Dairy Queen down there too,” they offered. 
“Great, thanks!”
We walked the .8 of a mile down the hill and past the Dairy Queen. At the food lion I purchased our Resupply items and bought Cole and I a banana to eat. A consolation prize of sorts. Then we walked right by that Dairy Queen once again headed back up the hill. 
The road split and we took the left fork, ignoring the sign that said Appalachian Trail pointing to the right. Shortly after, a loud clunking car with two young men in it stopped in front of us and asked us if we wanted a ride to the trail head. 
“Yes we sure would.”
“Good. You are headed the wrong way.”
We piled in and three short minutes later we were where we were supposed to be.
I said to Cole, “That could have been a disaster if we had kept heading up the wrong road this late in the day. It was like a miraculous intervention.”
He replied, “I wish we could have had Dairy Queen. I’m sorry for my attitude mom.” Then he smiled. I love that smile.
An apology while we were still in town may have been a last ditch effort to get DQ, but this apology was genuine. I would say that a heartfelt apology is worth giving up a banana split for.
We hiked three more miles before stopping for the night. The place we set up was close, very very close, to train tracks. The trains woke us up multiple times throughout the night.","Mile 620

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592535,"I usually do a foot inspection every night. Last night I found a small rash on my ankle. This morning it had blistered. Not really sure what it was, but fearing the worst I covered it with KT tape to keep it contained. The only things I know about poison ivy are that it blisters, it spreads and it is itchy!
My foot inspection also revealed bruising on the top of my right foot along the base of my toes. I have no idea what would be the cause of that. 
There is a reason that they tell you to wait for two weeks once you decide to give up the trail. That reason is because of days like today. It just sucked. 
Less than an hour into our hike it began to rain. And rain. And rain. My heels were hurting. Then my ankle started to itch. My right boot became a sloshy wet mess almost immediately and so it wasn’t too long before the entire foot ached. We sat in Rice Field Shelter for a good long while staring out at the rain and willing it to stop. That didn’t work so we ate lunch and trudged on.
The rain stopped around 2 in the afternoon, but by then I was so wet and miserable that there was no turning my grumpiness around....and no way to dry my feet so they would stop aching. I need to get my footwear sorted! There will be a lot more rain between here and Maine and I don’t want to keep whining about feet that are aching from being wet. Well actually, I won’t be whining because I’ll be throwing in the towel. 
There actually was one short time today when I wasn’t miserable. I sat down to rest just as the rain was letting up. An older lady, coming from the other direction, was taking a seat to rest too. She clearly wasn’t a backpacker, with her thin see through rain poncho and her mason jar of drinking water. I asked her where she was headed to. Back on the trail a way we had seen yellow police tape blocking off a section in the trees. She told us that behind this police line there is a tree sitter. The man sitting in the trees is trying to stop a pipe line from going through. The woman was on her way to try to smuggle food to the tree sitter. She spent some time explaining to me why she supports him, including how a chunk of her farm land was taken from her (with no compensation) for the use of the pipeline. I think that the reason that I was able to not be miserable as I sat and listened to her story is because for the first time all day I was not thinking about myself. After we had parted ways, I continued to think about her for a time, but then my thoughts turned back to grumpy old me with my sore feet and I was miserable once again.We weren’t exactly sure where we were aiming to get to. A few hikers we had lunch with said that they were going to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter even though it was closed. We considered this briefly, but when I spied a flat piece of ground under a soft bed of needles my feet decided that they were done. That’s it. No more.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592595,"The trail took its tole on us again today. At first I thought that it was only beating on me. We had some very steep climbs, more rocks and even cliffs. My knees and toes were complaining. Despite the rash on his toes, Cole seemed to be doing great, as always. The sun shone in the morning, but in the afternoon on and off drizzle kept the ground and rocks wet. 
Then Cole fell. I didn’t see it thankfully because it would have scared me to death. He said that his pole protected him from bashing his face and his arm on a rock, but he limped away with a sore foot and a broken trekking pole. He is rather upset about the pole. Better a broken pole than a broken Cole, I say. 
He walked with me for a little bit after he had fallen saying that he couldn’t go fast with only one pole. He picked up speed soon enough though and passed me as always. 
The shelter was only a couple of miles away. Once there he was concerned that his foot was a bit swollen and was worried about whether he could hike. My knees were doing a lot of throbbing and secretly I was wondering the same thing about myself. I guess that we will both have to wait and see what the morning brings.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592596,"Oh Virginia! What are you doing to me?
I had a great morning. It was overcast and a little drizzly, but I was able to use two pairs of sox and a plastic bag in my boot to keep the dampness at bay. I put bags in Cole’s boots too, but it didn’t seem to work for him. 
We started with a long up hill climb, but the rise was gentle and the run was long. I prefer this type of climb. It lasts longer but doesn’t zap my strength like a short steep climb.
Once at the top we had a long flat section along a ridge. It was very pretty in the mist. Then we went down, easily and gently just as we had gone up. 
Either I was flying along or else Cole was moseying, because I sat at the bottom of the hill for a while before he caught up to me. I had gone nine miles.
Despite the dampness, I was feeling very optimistic and foolishly expected an afternoon much like my morning had been. 
Silly Sheila.
We climbed again. Steeper. Rockier!!! We weren’t just stepping on rocks, we were climbing up onto them. It was slower and more tiring. The rocks were wet so every step had to be carefully placed.
When I reached Dragons Tooth I was really ready to be done, but was feeling like I had handled the day well. It was only 2.5 more miles down. 
Only. 
It was the hardest 2.5 Miles I have done yet on the AT. It wasn’t hiking. It was rock climbing...well in this case descending. Imaging making a pile of flat stones. Now offset them a bit and tip them up on their side vertically. Got that? Good. Now, starting from the middle, walk across the slab horizontally.  With a backpack on. There was a time when I was younger that this would have thrilled me. Tired and wet, I was unimpressed. And the rocks just kept coming and coming. My brain was tired from attending to my every step. I was grumpy. Cole kept smiling and commenting positively. My knees were dying.
Eventually we did make it down and to a road. There was a tenting spot in the woods right across the road, or there was a hostel .3 up the road. The descent from dragon’s tooth had bitten a chunk out of me...and apparently Cole too. His smile was gone and he was  exhausted. His toes were hurting and he didn’t want to walk the .3. He just wanted to collapse. I felt the same way. 
We assessed our water situation. We were almost out. There was a stream running along side the road, but one look at the colour of it turned us right off. It seemed we would be headed to the hostel.
In the end we were both glad we had chosen to go. When we arrived there were a number of other hikers licking their dragon’s tooth inflicted wounds.
“It was a hard day today wasn’t it?” A German hiker commented to me. As odd as it seems, being around other people who had just gone through what I had and were feeling the same way about it, actually made me feel better. Sometimes I feel like I am out here doing so much more poorly than everyone else.
We both had a shower, which helped to lift our spirits. There were hotdogs and freezies and delicious squares to eat. Once he was clean(ish) and fed, Cole day on the couch for a long time resting his feet.  A mattress under me and a huge fan blowing on me  drowning out the hostel noise sure felt like an upgrade over our wet tent, and I didn’t feel quite as beat up any more.","Niday Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592602,"What I don’t like about sleeping in hostels or shelters is that I am always concerned about disturbing other people in the morning. I am normally up around 6am, although I take my time getting ready. This morning I just hung out in my bunk until the lights went on at 7. By then the rooster outside had sounded his trumpet a few times, and a farm cat had wandered inside the wide open doorway of the hostel and had made his voice heard.
The fridge was stocked with farm fresh eggs, so I boiled half a dozen for Cole and I to eat for breakfast. They were good!
In the hiker box we scored a new rope to hang our food. I also snagged some large zip lock bags for our feet. We had both managed to get some sox dried out, but our boots were still wet. I put some body glide on Cole’s toes hoping that would help too.
My right boot has been letting water in since I got them at the beginning of the month. I have been in contact with New Balance about it via email, but getting an internet signal out here has been very unreliable lately. Finally I just asked my husband to try to deal with it. I had a message from him last night saying that New Balance will refund us for the boots. I just have to send them back. I was very happy to get that message! The plan is that Mark will get the replacement boots and bring them down when he visits shortly. Then he can take these leakers and send them back. I just have to put up with them a bit longer. As for Cole’s boots, we are very close to Daleville and we will replace his boots there. Things in the footwear department are looking brighter.
Before we hit the trail, we needed to purchase a few Resupply items. .3 of a mile on the other side of the AT was a “grocery” store. It ended up just being a gas station....a very expensive gas station. I just couldn’t bring myself to spend $3.29 on a package of spam!! We really only needed breakfast for tomorrow and lunch for a day and a half. I decided to just get snacks instead of lunches and grabbed some honey buns for Cole for breakfast. I also got him a big Mountain Dew to guzzle before we left. Before we left for Georgia, coke was always our pop of choice. On day 3 we had Mountain Dew from a trail angel. Since then, he wants a Mountain Dew as often as he can get his hands one one. 
We trekked back to the trail and as we started up it I saw a shopping bag sitting by a tree. 
Who left their garbage here? 
I went over to peek at it. Inside the bag were two unopened mountain house meals!  Wow! I looked around expecting to find an owner. There was nobody. I guess the new owner is me!
Not far down the trail we crossed a road. A car was coming down the road and the driver stopped when he saw hikers. ( By this point Cole had gone ahead, but there was another hiker just ahead of me). The driver got out and offered us water and Coke. This day was off to a really positive start! We also had a very special view to look forward to today. McAfee Knob. 
Rain was in the forecast, but it held off for a long time and we had a gorgeous view of the iconic overlook. 
Due to our late morning start and having to resupply, the day was much longer than it otherwise would have been. We are going further, but I don’t seem to be moving much faster. 
Late in the day the clouds moved in. By the time we got to the Tinker Cliffs we had been dumped on in a flash downpour and the views were shrouded in clouds. Cole’s feet were hurting him by then too, as were mine.
We set up the tent at Lambert’s Meadow Shelter and crawled inside just as another torrent came down on us. Water was dripping in at the top of the tent because the fly hadn’t been staked tightly. Through the floor of the tent we could see water flowing like a stream between the tent and the footprint. We blew up our air mattresses and piled our stuff and ourselves onto them. Anything that touched the floor or the walls of the tent was instantly wet. The ceiling dripped. We didn’t even get out our quilts...they would just get wet.
The rain paused for a bit and Cole darted outside to fix the fly. (I had to bribe him by promising to scratch his back when he came back in). The dripping stopped. We put our mattresses as close together as we could in the centre of the tent away from the walls, then we curled up on our little life rafts and tried to sleep as another onslaught of rain pounded away on our tiny shelter.","Four Pines Hostel

I woke up numerous times and kept myself awake constantly feeling around my air mattress to make certain that nothing was touching the tent walls. We had a hard time getting up in the morning, which wasn’t surprising. What was surprising was that we had managed to keep our sleeping clothes and covers dry. When we emerged from our tent we found that new streams had formed around us. 
The shelter was not full last night and Cole had mumbled a few times that we should have stayed in it. I was thinking the same thing but hadn’t voiced it. However, when I popped by the shelter on my way to the privy the occupants told me that they had been plagued by small flying insects all night long and hadn’t slept a wink. Hmm...what would have been worse, the flood or the gnats? Well, really it didn’t matter because no matter what was thrown at me there was one thing keeping me smiling and sane today. Daleville! Today we were go into Daleville. 
We didn’t feel the need to rush. We only had just over nine miles to hike.  My boots were a wet mess so I pulled out my plastic bags again. Of course my socks were damp so all the bags did was minimize the sloshing. Cole didn’t want bags on his feet and even wouldn’t let me put body glide on his flaming red swollen toes. I really hope they heal quickly once we get him new boots.

We shared a secret little laugh, wondering if they were going to find the toys we had hidden. Sometimes it is just the silly little shared moments like that which can determine your attitude. I needed all the silly little uplifting moments I could get because as we were headed out of our warm, dry hotel room, it was drizzling. 
Drizzle is actually ok. It keeps the temperature down, and once we are in among the trees, most of it misses us. however I have found that drizzle is quite often the precursor to heavier rainfall.
I tried something new this morning...hiking while listening to an audio book. I do like to hear what is going on around me, so I only put in one ear bud. I enjoyed it and it made time go by faster. When the drizzle turned to heavier rainfall, I put the book away.
I had plastic bags in my boots which kept my feet dry for most of the day. When we stopped for the day and Cole took his new boots off, he was excited to report that his sox were only sweaty and his toes were looking and feeling much better. 
We had to set the tent up in the rain so the floor inside was wet by the time we got the fly on. We do have an absorbent cloth specifically for moments like this, and it was actually dry and useful for cleaning up the water today.  Before I did laundry in Daleville, it had been constantly wet for a long time and not useful for much.
Once the floor was cleaned up, we crawled inside our dry little  sanctuary. We had almost no water, so cooking was out of the question. We ate sandwich rounds with bacon and cheese on them. The cheese was already a little bit sweaty from the humidity. Eventually the rain stopped but the trees above us dripped dripped dripped on the tent all night long.","Daleville VA

The forecast called for rain, but the sun was doing its best to pierce the damp mist that surrounded us. The results of its efforts were beams of light that broke through both mist and canopy, and illuminated the forest floor.
Some mornings the trail is criss crossed by translucent spider threads. I can’t even imagine the feats the spiders would need to perform to stretch their webs across such a distance. Clearly they had been hard at work during the night. The prize you get for being the first person down the trail in the morning is that you get to break the cobwebs. I’m positive that those over achieving arachnids knew it would be me coming down the trail and had sent someone to measure my height during the night and pass the information up the trail, because it seemed as though every other web made contact with my face. If the sun’s rays were shining at just the right angle, I could see the sticky traps before I made contact with them and used my pole to part the way. But more often, I knew a web was there because it tickled my nose as I walked through it. 
I was headed for the shelter 2.5 miles up the trail. It was the first water source and we were completely out. I had my nose a little out of joint though because the shelter was off the trail down a blue blaze. I don’t like doing extra miles. It would only add about a half of a mile to my day, but I still didn’t want to do it. Not only that but Cole had the water filter and I had The purification tablets. Once I collected the water I would need to wait 30 minutes before I could drink it. I was thirsty 
Before the sign for the shelter came within view, something bright blue caught my eye. I couldn’t believe it. Could it be? 
Yes it was!
A cooler sat on the ground at the head of the blue blaze trail leading to the shelter. Inside the cooler was gator aid. I didn’t have to walk the extra distance or wait 30 minutes after all! 
I came to many viewpoints along a parkway, just as we had yesterday. The clouds were clearing a bit, but still obstructed my view.
A few more miles up the trail I encountered more trail magic. A woman was sitting by a road crossing with a cooler of coke and Gatorade, as well as snacks. Cole had caught up to me by then and took full advantage when instructed by the trail angel to “take as many as he liked”.
It turned out to be a beautiful day for hiking, sunny but not too warm.  There is a woman from Germany, a few years my senior, who we have met at camp and on the trail quite a few times. Her trail name is Froulein. In the afternoon, Froulein caught up to me. I let her pass and she did, but then slowed down to about my speed. I picked up my pace a wee bit and we hiked together and chatted for a good long while. Eventually I lost my “umph” and had to stop for a rest. I don’t mind hiking alone most of the time, but having someone other than my son to hike with and talk to was really nice for a change.
Bryant Ridge Shelter is a large two story shelter thay can sleep 20 people. As soon as we arrived Cole scurried up to the second level to claim a space. About a dozen more hikers arrived but none ventured above the first level. We had the second floor all to ourselves.
A section hiker named Pirate said that he would cook up some Mexican tortillas with rice and beans if he had at least two people to share it with. My hollow legged son volunteered us and so we had a   nice dinner cooked for us.
During the night, lightening flashed and rain pummeled the shelter but we were safe and dry inside.","Harvey’s Knob Overlook

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593285,"We were up very early in the morning today. Everyone had been talking about the long steep climb that was ahead of us. For 9 miles most of the trail went up up up at a steep incline. It tired me out very quickly. Fräulein hiked with me for a while again today, slowing down her pace to match mine as we climbed the steep mountain. I tired out long before she did and finally had to sit down to take a break. She told me that every year she travels to Spain to hike a Camino. I didn’t know that there was more than one Camino. She said that the most popular Camino is not the most beautiful Camino. 
We hiked through the guillotine today which is a rock hallway of sorts with a large bolder on top that looks as though it is threatening to come down on your head. It is a popular spot for photos. 
We stopped for lunch at Thunder Hill Shelter and sat down at the picnic table with a section hiking couple. The wife was going through her food bag seemingly irritated and mumbling about too much weight.
“Do you want some snickers bars?” She asked, tossing three down onto the table.
I replied with something like “My Son is always happy to have more snacks.”
She added three more snickers bars to the pile. Then she pulled out three protein bars and added those. Next came some packages of cheese crackers, a dehydrated dinner and a bag of beef jerky. A bag of trail mix topped the pile and finally she was done. 
“Do you need fuel?” She asked, pulling out a large canister. I had to decline that.
Cole was thrilled and had gobbled up a pack of crackers and two snickers bars before I swept the pile into our food bags for later. 
We should hang out with section hikers more often! 
The afternoon’s hike was easier than the morning’s. We arrived to a packed saddle at Marble Spring. As I cooked dinner, a curious young fawn skirted the perimeter of the campsite, perhaps intrigued by all of the tents. She disappeared into the trees in one direction, but soon returned and cast her curious eyes our way as she casually passed by heading the opposite way. She never returned after that.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593578,"It was another beautiful day for hiking today and most of the morning hike was gentle and down hill. Our plan was to Resupply in Glasgow and get right back out again. The only hitch was....we had to hitch. It is 5.9 miles from the trail into Glasgow. We haven’t hitchhiked yet, but it is common on the trail for hikers to do this to get to town. Our closest experience was asking people for a ride when we were trying to get to Gatlinburg. Last night Fräulein  told me a funny story about her hitchhiking experience. The spot she came out to the road at from the trail did not appear to be a good place to hitchhike so she walked up the road a ways in the opposite direction that she wanted to go and found a pull out which seemed like a better place to hitchhike. A car pulled over and the driver told her that he could only take her a short way. She thought he said 3 miles but in actuality he said .3 of a mile. He ended up driving her right back to the spot on the road where she had come off the trail. 
When we reached US 501 I stuck out my thumb. I was actually on the opposite side of the road to what I should have been on, but due to the curve of the road and the lack of a shoulder, I chose the safer side.
It took about 20 minutes before a truck pulled over. His wife was hiking the AT and he and their five year old twins were following along pulling a travel trailer. I sat in the back with the chatty five year olds. A third hiker showed up needing a ride, so he joined Cole in the front seat. Not only did our driver take us in to the Dollar General, but he brought us back to the trail as well. We had talked about having lunch in town, but couldn’t say no to a guaranteed ride back to the trail. I really didn’t want to have to hitchhike again if I could avoid it. 
Our afternoon hike was not nearly as gentle as our morning hike had been. It was steep. The afternoon wore on slowly as we climbed. Even Cole was getting tired out. At one point we sat resting together on a rock, scratching each other’s backs. 
With our daily mileage goal, often we are not aiming for a shelter or marked campsite, but just hoping to find a spot to set up near our mileage destination. Today we were hoping for something near Saltlog Gap. We were both exhausted by the time we reached the Gap, but all we could find was one small campsite that was already occupied by a sleeping hammocker. We had to keep going. Up we went some more, climbing all the way up Bluff mountain. It was a beautiful view, and just before the top, down a somewhat overgrown trail, there was a grass covered clearing with room for a dozen tents. It was perfect.","Marble Spring Campsite
",Bluff Mountain,"Jun 05, Tue",16.60
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593579,"We had another lovely morning with both weather and terrain. I went 10.5 miles before I stopped to wait for Cole to catch up. I carry dinner in my backpack, he carries lunch. Sometimes hunger is a motivating factoring in deciding to stop, if Cole is taking a while to catch up to me. 
We had lunch at Brown Mountain Creek Shelter and were excited that we only had a few miles left before reaching our mileage goal. The next shelter was .6 of a mile off the trail. I sure didn’t want to do 1.2 miles just to get to and from a shelter. The problem was, the next water source was at the shelter. 
I filled up my water bottles and headed out from Brown Mountain Creek Shelter before Cole. About two miles up the trail I crossed a road and was going by a parking lot when a guy shouted, “Would you like a drink?”
“Sure” I replied and headed over to his car where he and his buddy had a cooler strapped to a carrier on the back bumper.
“Beer or soda?”
“Soda please.”
An outsider would probably be shocked by how trusting thru hikers are of strangers offering them drinks, food, rides, and sometimes even a place to stay. These strangers, or trail angels as we call them, are often past thru hikers who have allready experienced what we were going through and know how much a cold beverage at just the right time could really make a hiker’s day. Such was the case with these two. They had received help during their hike and wanted to give it back in return. They said that I was the first person to pass by and were thinking about trying to find a spot with more hiker traffic. I told them that my son would soon be coming up behind me. 
We talked for a bit longer as I finished my soda and then gave them the empty can. Then I headed back up the trail. Straight UP the trail. 
Um....hello Virginia!  Switchbacks! Have you heard of them??
I tired quickly and after about a mile and a half I stopped to rest. 
Another hiker passed me as I sat. I greeted him and asked him if he had received a drink from the trail magic. He said that he had seen a can of Sprite sitting on the ground by the trail,  but because he had just resupplied, he had left it for the next person. 
From this reply I surmised that the trail angels had moved on to try a new location and  had left behind a Sprite for Cole since I had told them he was coming up behind me. I was glad the hiker had left it.
Not long after that I heard the clack-pause-clack of a single poled trekker and knew that it was Cole.
“Did you get your Sprite?” I asked him when he came within hearing distance.
He stopped dead cold.
“That was for me?” He asked, wide eyed.
“Yes that was for you. Didn’t you drink it?”
“There was only one there and I didn’t know if I should. I even picked it up and smelled it.”
“You smelled it?”
“Yes, but I decided that I shouldn’t take it. It was for me?”
I explained about the guys with cooler. Cole wanted to drop his pack and go back for the pop, but I wouldn’t let him. It would have been a three mile return trip.
We continued slowly up the steep incline together. Every so often Cole would kick himself again and mutter, “I should have taken the Sprite!”
Up we climbed some more. My “Mountain Goat” seemed just as exhausted as I was, but steep inclines like this rarely offered any kind of flat surface for camping on so we kept moving forward.
Finally we reached the summit of Bald Knob, and just as the guide book promised, it was not Bald. However, just past the top there was one camping spot. Dropping my bag I declared “Wooohooo, we made it home for the night.” to which Cole replied, “I should have drunk the sprite.”
We ate a cold dinner to conserve our water and at least one of us fell asleep dreaming of cold soda.","Bluff Mountain
",Bald Knob,"Jun 06, Wed",15.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593714,"It was a cool misty morning. I got myself packed up and divided our remaining water while Cole lay stretched out on his deflated mattress. It had acquired a slow leak and now could not make it through the night fully inflated. 
We had half a litre of water each. Before I set out, I checked Guthooks and told Cole where the next water sources were. The first one would require him to hike an extra 1.2 miles and I strongly encouraged him to not take that one. If he could make it 3.5 Miles there would be a shorter side trail of only .3  There could possibly be no water directly on the trail for 9 miles.
I enjoyed hiking in the mist in the morning, especially when the trail brought me out onto a Bald. We had not crossed a Bald in a while and the change of scenery was nice. It also happened to be on Cole Mountain.
When I came down into salt log gap there was a car parked by the road. Not far off I found the same two gentlemen doing trail magic who I had encountered yesterday. They had moved to this spot yesterday upon the advice of a shuttle driver and had served up a barbecue to a group of thru hikers and then spent the night. I told them how Cole had suspiciously passed up the Sprite that they had left on the trail for him and then had regretted it later. They  joked about putting another one on the trail and then watching him to see what he would do. They gave me another soda and then they filled my water bottle up for me. Now no side trail trip for water was necessary. I thanked them and continued on.
When Cole arrived one of them called out “Are you going to take the Sprite this time?” Not only did he take the pop, but they filled his water bottles and fed him plenty of snacks too. Thank you guys!!!
We stopped at Seeley-Woolworth Shelter for lunch and guess who showed up!  Fräulein. She hikes with “Roberts” ( as in The Dread Pirate Roberts) He is also from Germany. They neroed in Glasgow and just caught up to us. Fräulein is not thru hiking. She is going to Harper’s ferry. Next year she will return to finish the trail. 
Someone else showed up at that shelter for lunch. There is another Mountain Goat on the trail, but a much older one. We first met him at Partnership Shelter. He hikes fast and does big miles, so we didn’t really think that we would see him again. But we did. We found him at the Four Pines Hostel resting a swollen red ankle. It looked pretty bad and once we left, we didn’t think that we would see him again. Two days later we found him in Daleville. What had taken us two days to hike, he had done in one. His ankle still looked bad. He had seen a doctor and was instructed to rest it for a few days and then return for a second visit. When we left him in Daleville resting his ankle, we didn’t think that we would see him again. 
Then the old goat showed up at the shelter today. His ankle looked much better. He was hiking fast and doing big miles. I don’t think that we will see him again.
On Guthooks we saw that there were a few tent sites with excellent views at the top of Priest mountain. We decided to head there. Roberts and Fräulein decided to head there as well. Fräulein and I hiked together for a while and it made the time go by faster. We filled up our water bottles at the priest shelter before going the extra .3 to the viewpoint. We were the only ones there. The view was stunning.","Bald Knob

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594295,"Roberts and Fräulein set out very early this morning. They are both on a tight schedule to get to Harpers Ferry. Fräulein has a short visa and will be going home. Roberts hiked the AT last year with his wife, but had to stop due to injury around mile 1300. This year he started all over again, but his wife didn’t want to redo what she had already done. She is meeting him at Harpers Ferry and they will continue on from there together.
There were lots of rocky climbs and descents today. I sometimes think that Virginia is trying to prepare us for what is to come in Pensilvania. 
We stopped for the day at Maupin Field Shelter, a couple of miles short of our goal. My guidebook said that approx 1.7 miles from this shelter there was a cabin resort that had a country store and deli on site. Not one to ever want to walk extra miles, I did have strong motivation to get to that store. We were almost out of toilet paper.  I have been taking an antibiotic since our stop in Daleville to try to get the infection on my skin cleared up. Unfortunately I’ve been experiencing some side effects. I need toilet paper. Well, I need more than that, but for now, TP would help. Cole was almost out of snacks too and I had decided that “deli” must include hamburgers, and I wanted one. Cole agreed. 
We set up the tent and leaving everything but our raincoats behind, we headed down a forest service road, following the directions in the guidebook. It rained briefly. Wet and smelly we arrived at Royal Oaks Cabins. There was nobody around but a big banner said Hiker and Biker entrance. That made us slightly less concerned about our appearance and we headed that way. Finally we found a building that said Country Store on the front and we went inside. There was one shelf laden with a jumbled assortment of grocery type items, but no toilet paper. A white board had a list of deli items that you could order. Ham burgers were on the list. With a price of only $3 I assumed that they would be fairly small, so we both ordered a sandwich to go along with it. 
“Sorry, we are out of burgers.”
We ordered hotdogs instead and stocked up on snacks.
The food was ok, certainly better than what we would have whipped up back at camp. With full bellies we retraced our way back to camp. I headed to bed while Cole hung around the campfire with section hikers eating s’mores.","The Priest Summit
",Maupin Field Shelter,"Jun 08, Fri",13.50
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594416,"First thing in the morning I grabbed our small amount of remaining TP and dashed to the privy to take care of business. Sitting there on the ledge beside the privy was a glorious roll of nearly new quilted two ply. On two previous occasions I have found toilet paper in the privy, however both times it had been ravaged by mice. This roll was in pristine condition. Amazing! Around my mostly empty roll I wound as much as I felt we required to get us to Waynesboro and left the remainder for the next needy soul.
There was more climbing and more rocks, but also sunshine and lovely views. Our backpacks were light which meant that our food supply was low, but Cole was stocked up on snacks and our bellies were content.
In the late afternoon the sky began to rumble. Quite a few hikers who we hadn’t seen for a while wizzed on by us headed into town. One hiker named Pika slowed for a bit and we walked together for the last mile and a half to the shelter. It made the time fly by quickly. We talked about the”Virginia Blues”.  A lot of people seem to be feeling them, myself included.
At the shelter Cole and I finished setting up the tent just as the clouds let loose the torrent they had been threatening. At this particular shelter the roof extended out over a deck to make a covered seating area. At most shelters only the sleeping area is covered. We cooked our dinner at the picnic table and chatted with the three other thru hikers and half a dozen section hikers who were there. We have been encountering a lot more section hikers lately. 
With the thru hikers we talked about  the people we knew who had quit the trail (given up on thru hiking), and the people we wondered about because we had not seen them in a long time.
“It should be like The Hunger Games,” someone suggested. “Whenever a person quits, a cannon should go off and their image should appear in the sky.”
Shortly thereafter an incredibly loud cracking sound jerked us all to attention. Through the canopy of the trees not far away we saw a tree toppling. There was no final crash, thud or any sound indicating the tree had hit the ground. It must have been caught in the arms of the trees that surrounded it. I am certain it will make its grand finale when the limbs, branches or even trunks that are supporting it give way. Nobody ventured over to check it out. 
“There is your cannon shot,” I said. Somebody must have quit the trail.”
The rain petered out and I retreated to the tent for the night. Cole followed shortly after.","Maupin Field Shelter
",Paul C Wolfe Shelter,"Jun 09, Sat",15.80
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594419,"We started off the day in very high spirits. Today my husband and first born were driving down to meet us. The plan was that they would bring our huge eight man tent and set up a base camp at Loft Mountain Campsite in Shanandoah National Park. From there they would take us to the trail head in the morning and pick us up at the end of our hiking day. This way we could spend a few days with them but also get some miles in. We planned to meet them at the Sawmill Run Overlook. 
We were not in a hurry as we headed out. We had 16 miles to hike while they had a nine hour drive, plus pee stops and a boarder crossing. 
Just before reaching the road that leads to Waynesboro, I came upon a cooler sitting by the side of the trail. A note attached to it said “For thru hikers and section hikers.” I held my breath as I lifted the lid. Recently we had come across a cooler on the trail which contained nothing but garbage. This cooler did not disappoint. Inside was cold gatoraid    and clementines. I sat myself down in the grass beside the cooler and partook. Cole showed up shortly after and joined me.
After our rest, we proceeded to the road where we found a bag with more clementines and bananas. We shared a banana.
My trail app was showing a visitor centre that appeared to be right by the trail. Cole needed to go to the bathroom and decided that he wanted an actual toilet, not a hole. We set out to find the visitor centre. 
Initially we walked in the wrong direction and came to a group of bikers pulled over next to an information board.
“Are you going to hike all 100 miles?” One of them asked, referring to the length of the trail which runs through Shenandoah Nation Park.
“It’s only 100 miles?” I asked jokingly. It took me 850 to get here.”
“You hiked 850 miles?”
“Well actually, I think it might be closer to 875.” I replied.
“You are my hero!” he stated, and I laughed. Then I asked about the visitor centre and he pointed the way.
We walked about a half of a mile, half of that up a steep hill, to get to the visitor centre  so that Cole didn’t have to dig a hole. However, when we arrived, the door was locked.
Back down the hill we went and retraced our steps back to the AT. I waited at the guard rail while Cole hiked up the trail, trowel in hand. When he returned he was downing another gatoraid. He had raided the cooler one more time.
We followed the white blazes along the road for a short distance before they led us back up into the forest. Soon we were at a self serve entry station. We were now in Shenandoah National Park. 
We moved along fairly quickly until we stopped for a long lunch break. All the food we had left was a tortilla and a packet of tuna each and some cuscus. We ate the tortillas with tuna, rested and resumed hiking.
As we hike along the trail each day there is quite often wildlife that hustles to get out of our way. Mostly it is chipmunks and squirrels. The chipmunks seem to have their escape route already preplanned as they make a beeline in one direction and disappear into some hidden safe haven. The squirrels, on the other hand, react in a disorganized panicked fashion. They will head in one direction but then change their mind and head in another. Sometimes they will leap for tiny branches that can’t hold them, spill to the ground then dart up a tree. They might even stop and stare at us once they are within a safe distance. They are unpredictable and sometimes outrageously funny with their comical clumsiness.
Bunnies will watch as I approach, twitching their noses, then silently bounding out of the way. Deer can be silent too, with only the quietest crack of a twig catching my attention causing me to turn and see them frozen there, waiting for me to pass by. But sometimes they aren’t quiet and it is their graceful bounding that rustles  the forest and turning I only catch the patch of their white tails as they leap away.
Today I heard a disturbance in the trees as something panicked at my appearance and quickly tried to put distance between us. It was too big to be a squirrel or a chipmunk, and much too heavy and clumsy sounding to be a deer. A young deer perhaps, I thought, who had not yet grown into her gracefulness. I peered between the trees trying to catch a glimpse of what I had frightened. For a fleeting moment what caught my eye was the black behind of a bear. It was running in the right direction. Away.
Our water was low so we stopped at a stream. As Cole was filtering the water it began to rain. And then it poured. We only had one bottle filled but packed up the filter and hurried on. It didn’t take long before we were soaked from head to toe.
“I hope that Evan and Dad are at the road when we get there,” Cole said.
The rain let up as we reached Sawmill Run Overlook. Nobody was there. We sat down on a stone wall that ran the length of the Overlook. Taking off our boots, we rung the dirty water out of our socks and laid them out on the stones. I pulled out my phone to check for a connection. Bingo! I messaged Mark. 
What is your ETA?
8:30
It was 5:00
It began to rain again.
Cole pulled out the dirt covered sheet of tyvec that we use for a footprint and we held it over our heads. Our bare feet stuck out the bottom resting on our sloppy wet boots. We must have been quite the spectacle. A few cars drove into the pull out to take in the view of the Overlook. They slowed down without stopping and steered clear of where we sat. 
Clothed in wet attire and no longer generating heat through movement, we began to shiver. 
“ We can’t sit here for hours shivering.” I said. 
Briefly I contemplated trying to hitch back to Waynesboro, but quickly scratched the idea. 
“We need to set up the tent and get out of our wet clothes.”
Initially Cole didn’t want to, but as it continued to pour and our shivering worsened, he changed his mind. He headed up the trail to scout out a spot for the tent and returned quickly having located a place not far from the road. 
Once the tent was up we used our wiping cloth to mop up the puddles and whatever else we could find to dry the inside. Then we stripped off our wet clothes, put on our dry sleeping clothes and crawled into our quilts. In the food bag we still had cuscus, but by then we had drunk the water that Cole had filtered so we had no way to cook it. 
“I just want to go to sleep.” Cole said, hunkering down in his bed. 
“I do too.” I replied.
I sent Mark a text explaining our situation and asking him to get us in the morning. Then we fell asleep, warm but hungry and deflated.","Paul C Wolfe Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594476,"Mark and Evan arrived very early the next morning to retrieve us from our camping spot at Sawmill Run Overlook.  We had not yet even begun to pack up. Cole ran up to the parking area while I stuffed our backpacks haphazardly. Soon Mark ventured down to our camping spot to bring me some clean dry clothes. He stuck his head inside of the tent and reeled at the odour. I couldn’t smell anything.
It was still raining outside and it was expected to rain all day. Instead of heading to Loft Mountain Campground, we opted instead to Drive back into Waynesboro and get a hotel room, but first we stopped for breakfast.
 On our way into Wainsborough we passed a hiker who was hitching. We have to pick him up I said. 
“ Mom, we don’t have room” 
said Evan.
All of the camping gear was piled high and the back row of seats was collapsed into the floor.
“We can make room” I said.
Mark pulled over and begin rearranging the gear at the back. He was able to clear a pile from the top of a bin.
 “I’ll sit on the bin.” Evan volunteered.
“No you won’t. There is no seatbelt. The hiker can sit there.”
“You are going to let him sit somewhere unsafe?”
“Ok, I will sit there and he can sit up front beside dad.”
Finally we got things sorted, did a U turn and headed back. As we passed him again, the backpacker was climbing into a pick up truck. Oh well, the thought was there.
They wouldn’t let us check in to the hotel  until 1 PM so we went to Walmart to do some grocery shopping,  checked out the local outfitter, and ate pizza. Once into the hotel room, we showered and I washed my air mattress in the bathtub while Mark graciously took our smelly clothing to the laundromat. It was a productive zero. ","Sawmill Run Overlook

He held the record for the oldest person to hike the Appalachian Trail up until last year when someone else claimed it. He is back on the trail this year trying to reclaim his title.
Mark drove us back to Saw  Mill run Overlook, and with no more than a small pack containing water, snacks and a raincoat we set out. The terrain was easy and with our lightened loads the miles flew by. At one point Cole said to me, “mom you look so young today. I think it’s because of your clean shirt.”
So, there you have it. The secret to youthful appearance is to wear a clean shirt.
We had initially asked Mark to pick us up at 7 o’clock but with our rapid pace we realized that we would be at the meeting point 2 hours early. We had to walk right past the campground, so Cole took a side trail into the campground to let Mark know of our new ETA.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594642,"This morning Mark dropped us off where he had picked us up yesterday at Ivy Creek Overlook.  I found the terrain to be quite different today compared to yesterday. There were many Rocky ups and downs. It took us a bit longer but still we were able to do 21 1/2 miles by 5 30. 
I realized something today. I have been having pain in my left shoulder off and on since Irwin. Initially I thought that it was from carrying a fully loaded backpack up steep hills. However, I also experience the pain when I was almost out of food. At that point I began to question the proper fit of my backpack. Was it too small? That didn’t really make much sense because I had no problems with it for the first 400 miles. However I continued to adjust and readjust my back back trying to make up my shoulder more comfortable when the pain came.
Both yesterday and today my shoulder was in pain and I wasn’t even carrying my backpack. The hydration bag weighed next to nothing and I knew the pain had to be from something else. Then I had an idea. Maybe the pain is from the repetitive movement of my arm using my trekking  poll. I spent a good part of the day only using my trekking poll in my right hand. This helped immensely. As I hiked I exercised my left shoulder stretching it in different ways. This too greatly alleviated the pain. I rely on my tracking polls a lot. They have saved me from a countless number of spills. There is no way I would ever consider hiking without the polls. However, it seems like I will need to give my left arm a break now and then throughout the day and continue to do stretches and exercises. It is a big relief to finally know where the pain is coming from.
Mark cooked for us again, and cleaned up afterwards too. Then he dutifully rubbed my shoulders and feet. Can thru hiking be like this every day? Please?","Ivy Creek Overlook

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594792,"On our third and final day of slack packing we decided to go a shorter distance so that we could be finished sooner and spend more time with Evan and Mark. Well, that was the plan anyway. We asked Mark to pick us up at Skyland Service Rd North parking lot. However, there is also a Skyland resort and restaurant with a separate parking lot. At the end of the day we sat waiting for him at one while he sat waiting for us at the other.  I had no cell service at that point so I was sending him messages that weren’t going through and he was sending me messages that weren’t going through. Eventually it did get figured out and he came to get us.
It was almost an hour drive to get back to the campsite now, but we took a detour and went into town for dinner and to do some last-minute shopping.
There is something that I want to say about slack packing. While it was certainly a delight to not have to carry such a weight on my back for three days, I had a very odd feeling that I was no longer part of a group that I had come to identify myself with. Nobody did or said anything at all to make me feel that way. I just felt it. When we met people on the trail who we knew, they realized right away what we were doing. We have seen many of our acquaintances slackpacking throughout this adventure too.  When we came upon other thru hikers who we had not yet met, they did not recognize us as thru hikers. In fact, we were the complete opposite of what a thru hiker usually is. We were clean and had on fresh smelling clothes each day (and even deodorant!). Our backs were not laden with the necessities of our current life. We weren’t even hungry. We knew there would be dinner cooked for us at the end of the day, and while we are still sleeping in a tent, it is the Hilton of all tent.  We could even stand up while getting dressed! We were living in tenting luxury. Plus, we were not alone. We had our family, our support, our loved ones with us. What a difference all of these things  made to how I felt. 
There was a lot of sorting and packing and organizing to do in the evening. A lot of our backpacking gear had been mixed in with the car camping gear and it all needed to be located. I had to organize and pack our food as well.
After spending four days with the family I was exhausted. We were keeping “normal” hours,  but maintaining the exertion level of a thru hiker. I just hadn’t had enough sleep. It was catching up to Cole too.","Lewis Mountain Campground

I also wanted to go through all of our things again to make certain we had gathered up everything that needed to be in our backpacks. I packed both of our bags, checking off on a mental list everything we should have. There was one thing missing. The trowel. 
When our campsite was packed up, we hit the road. It was an hour drive from the campground to where we had hiked to yesterday. Once they dropped us off Mark and Evan would continue heading north to home. Being with family was definitely a morale booster, something we both needed, and something we could benefit from more often. It was even more than the company though. It was getting our gear taken care of as well. Mark had brought me my replacement boots. Hopefully they will be as fantastic as the first pair I owned and a great improvement from their predecessors. He also brought Cole New trekking polls and a replacement air mattress. He patched holes in our tent fly as well as the screen and replaced the batteries in our headlamps and in Cole’s watch. My clothing had begun to wear out too so he brought me a new pair of pants and new underwear. For Cole he brought a pair of sleeping shorts to replace the wool
long johns he had still been wearing. We were definitely getting a fresh start
An unusually high number of squirrels were hanging out all up and down the highway this morning. They went into their frenzied “which way now?” furry as we approached. Then there was a dear standing on our side of the road. Unmoving, it eyed us as we neared it and slowed.
A vehicle was approaching from the other direction. Cole yelled, “It’s Miss Janet!”
Sure enough it was. We had already stopped for the deer. Mark lowered his window and flagged her down. I jumped out of the van and ran over to give her a hug. We chatted for a bit but we both had to move on as traffic lined up behind our vehicles. 
When we arrived at the Skyland Parking lot, Cole and I donned our backpacks. Our family hugged us, kissed us, prayed for us, then hugged us some more. 
“You don’t have to hike anymore mom.” Evan said. 
He misses me. A lot. That made leaving hard.
More hugs , more kisses, then we were off on the trail alone once again, heading North to Katahdin.
Our bags were heavy with Resupply items and special treats as well. It only takes a couple of times of having to Resupply at Dollar General before you really appreciate having a good place to Resupply. I appreciated it a bit too much I think. 
We were spoiled from slackpackong for three days, but after a period of sluggishness my body said, “oh I remember this”, and then mustered up what was required to get a rhythmic pace going. 
Originally we decided that we would go 16 miles and try to get to bed early. With our family visiting us, our bedtime got pushed back. Four nights with less sleep had caught up to both of us. However, in the guidebook I saw that we would be coming up to a wayside at the end of the day. The waysides are like a convenience store, gift shop and deli all rolled into one. A blackberry milkshake at the end of the day sounded like a really good idea. It took nothing at all to convince Cole. Our new distance was 18 miles. 
We stopped at a picnic area for lunch where we met up with Pirate and two other hikers. Pirate asked if we had seen a bear yet. He had not, and was anxious to have a bear story to tell like everyone else.
Shortly after, I was hiking along ahead of Cole, when suddenly I happened upon a bear about fifteen feet from the trail. I had to blink and look again. It didn’t really care that I was there, but I certainly wasn’t going to pass by that close to it. The trail in front of me curved around which would have brought me in closer proximity to the bear.
I began to yell at it. “Go away bear, go away.” It didn’t care. In fact, it took a few steps closer to me, not because I was there, but because that just happened to be where what he was nibbling on was leading him.
“BEAR! GO AWAY!”
I swung my poles around and clanged them together. Still, that bear didn’t care. He stepped closer.
I heard Cole coming up the trail behind me. He had a big smile on his face and he was laughing.
“There is no bear.” he said, thinking that I was trying to trick him.
I shouted and pounded and clanged some more.
“Is there a bear? Oh!!! There IS a bear.”
The bear did not seem to like the arrival of the newcomer. Could he count and had realized he was outnumbered? He turned and ran away.
We caught up to Pirate again a while later. By then, he had seen a bear too and we swapped stories.
Cole saw two more bears on his own before the day was through.
Deer were plentiful on the trail today as well and they were not afraid of us either. On two separate occasions a deer walked up the trail straight for us as though it were coming to check us out.
We arrived at the wayside around 6pm.  Other hikers had convinced us to go for the blackberry ice cream instead of the milkshake, so that is what we got. Cole also had a hamburger and I a grilled cheese. We bought a new trowel also.
It was getting late. We heard that there was a small campsite a short distance up the trail, but by the time we got there it was full. We walked a bit further, about a mile in total, and found a flat enough spot to set up the tent. I was a bit nervous about all of the bears in the vicinity. We put everything that we had with any kind of scent into food bags and Cole did an excellent job hanging them. We settled in for the night with one ear open listening for bears.
PS
Please note: (mom) I did not pull Out the camera to take a picture of the bear until he was moving away.","Skyland Service Rd North

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594805,"The food bags, the tent and the two backpackers inside,  all had a bear free night. However, in the morning, Cole saw two bears in the first couple of hours hiking. I came across another one too. It was not as close to the trail this time, but it was heading back to the trail towards the way I had come. Cole would soon be coming from there. Again I shouted and clanged, but this bear ignored me also. Cole heard it though and didn’t doubt me this time. He began shouting too and when he came into view waving his poles, the bear turned and bounded away. I just must be so exceptionally sweet and kind looking that I can’t scare bears away! lol
At lunch time today I pulled out Cole’s snack bag and found it 3/4 empty. In a day and a half he had eaten most of the snacks I had given him to last five days. I need to figure out some things that will be more filling. Snickers bars, cliff bars and trail mix seem to be ok. The cheese and crackers and granola bars aren’t filling him. He gets four bar type snacks a day plus trail mix and some kind of candy. This is on top of three meals. And he is still hungry.
Today was our last day in Shenandoah National Park. Just outside of the park we stopped at Tom Floyd Shelter. It was early in the afternoon and we were looking to get some extra rest. Our big sawyer water bag decided to spring a leak. The water source for the shelter was a small spring a long way down a steep hill. I went first, but my arm wasn’t long enough to reach the flow which was recessed into the rocks. So up I climbed and Cole went down. He had to keep refilling the dirty water bag because more was leaking out than what was being filtered through. It ate up a lot of time and he was very frustrated.","Mile 952.7

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594807,"I had a great hike today! It was overcast and extremely humid. The black flies seemed to like the weather and hovered in a swarm right in front of my face, getting in my eyes, up my nose and between my teeth as I smiled and walked. Finally I sprayed my hat with bug spray and that seemed to fend them off. Sweat kept dripping off the end of my nose and my chin like a pair of leaky faucets. The trail had numerous lengthy flat sections, but that is only part of what was lifting my spirits. We are so close now to the half way point of the trail and I am extremely excited to reach that milestone. By Wednesday we should reach harpers ferry which is the psychological halfway point of the trail.
After a  time I begin to think about what I will look forward to after we reach the half way point. I will need continuous motivation to keep my spirits up and my sights on the finish line. What will that motivation be?
When we begin this journey I knew that the success rate for thru hikers was very low. At one point I even asked myself, If I don’t make it to the end,  how far must I go to be content with my results? Will 100 miles be enough? Will 500 miles be enough? Will halfway be enough? I never did come up with an answer to that question,  and now I know why. Only 2195 miles will be enough. If I don’t make it to the end, there is no distance that will comfort me. When I sit at home thinking about what I didn’t achieve, no number of miles, no matter how great, will console my disappointment in myself. Will this realization be the motivation I need? I am not sure.
We stopped at Jim and Molly Denton shelter for lunch. It is a beautiful new shelter with a porch and Adirondack chairs and even a solar shower. When I first arrived I was determined to take a shower despite the fact that the water was freezing cold. However I decided to sit and have lunch first. Big mistake. By the time my lunch was finished I had cooled off considerably and there was no way that I wanted a freezing cold shower. Less than a mile down the trail I was once again ready for that cold shower. Too late, I missed my chance.
In about 5 miles we came to another shelter and stopped to replenish our water and take a nice long break. With the holes in our water bag, it was very difficult to filter water. I have come to the conclusion that Sawyer sucks at making water collection bags. They all spring leaks within a short period of time.
The remaining 4.5 miles of the day seemed sluggish and long. The sun had made an appearance and the Air didn’t feel quite as sticky. However, I was tired. Very tired. So tired that my eyes were heavy and my head was feeling a little cloudy. I ate a protein bar and drank a half a liter of water to try to give myself an energy boost.
With only .4 to go I thought I was going to nod off. So, I did what any sane hiker would do....I started to dance my way down the trail. Under my breath I chanted “go girl, you go girl, you do this point four, do this point four.” I laughed at myself, stubbed my toe a couple of times and imagined how embarrassed Cole would be if he saw me. 
I quickly reached the trail leading to the shelter. It was a blue blaze....... point four miles long. Normally that would have made me grumble. Not this time! This time I turned down that blue blazed trail and started dancing down the trail all over again.  “go girl, you go girl, you do this point four, do this point four!”
We had a strong Verison signal in the shelter area. Cole was able to video call his dad and wish him a Happy Father’s Day.","Tom Floyd Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594940,"It was another sticky humid day. I thought that I’d had a good night sleep, but was still tired and foggy as I hiked. I drank plenty of water, always adding electrolytes hoping that would perk me up. It didn’t.
In the morning the trail was fairly gentle with long flat stretches, but we knew that was coming to an end very soon.
I meandered down the trail in a dreamy state headed for the next shelter to meet up with Cole for lunch. My bladder was full, but I had it in my head that I wanted to use the privy, so I held it. I just wanted to sit, not squat low  behind a tree with my feet spread eagle to avoid backsplash on my boots. I just wanted to be normal and sit.
It was sunny although the trees shaded me. A lovely sweet scent filled my nostrils but I couldn’t see any blooms that would have given off such a delightful fragrance. The birds were chirping their myriad of courses and I walked.
Down the trail in front of me a wild turkey stepped out from the brush and made her way down the path ahead. I smiled. 
A moment later, two baby turkeys popped out behind her.  Delighted, I smiled some more. Cautious is what I should have been, but with my head in a fog and my thoughts in a cloud I continued on behind them.
Then, mom disappeared back into the brush to the left. Her babies darted into brush to the right, and dopey hiker girl just continued to walk ahead right up the path between then.
Suddenly from the brush momma came charging, all puffed up with her wings spread wide and squaking as loud as she could. In that instant my eyes bulged, I gasped audibly, jumped backwards 
two feet and was as wide awake as I had ever been in my life. Inexplicably I  somehow kept myself from wetting my pants. I thought she was going to lunge at me, but instead she took off into the brush on the other side of the trail in pursuit of her offspring, continuing her loud tirade as she went. 
I moved along at a brisk pace until I had put some distance between us, and then I found a tree to hide behind and did my business. No backsplash. 
After lunch we began a section of trail called The Rollercoaster. This is a 13.5 mile section of steep, rocky ups and downs. There were no views to reward us for our efforts. Just pointless ups and downs, or PUDS, as they are called. The going was very slow. At almost every low point there was water. Cole was not drinking enough though. He had sacrificed one of his smart water bottles to use for collecting dirty water. When he thread it into the coupling on the sawyer filter, the threads were ascu. In an attempt to remove it, he mangled the neck of the bottle. He was able to uncrumple it slightly, but collecting and filtering water was very slow. Well, guess what I found sitting by the trail. A Smartwater bottle. This helped him with the filtering.
We thought that we might try to reach Bears Den Hostel. Ice cream and soda were motivating, but not motivating enough. When we reached a campsite in a ravine by a wide swift running stream, we decided that the day was done. The air by the stream was much cooler and made it very comfortable for sleeping.","Dick’s Dome Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595314,"It was such a long day today! There just seemed to be a lot of things that slowed us down.
We woke up to fresh cool air. It seemed like it would be an excellent day for hiking. I had forgotten about the drop in temperature we had felt once we had come down by the water. As soon as we ventured away from the bubbling stream, hot muggy air enveloped us. 
Back out onto the rollercoaster I went ahead while Cole rolled out of bed. 
Within just a couple of miles I came out to a highway. I had to turn to Guthooks to find out which direction the AT was. It was down the road a ways and then across both sides of the divided highway.  I wasn’t certain that Cole would be able to find it on his own, so I waited. Forty-five minutes later Cole arrived. 
When I reached the Virginia/West Virginia state line, I encountered a couple of day hikers who had a lot of questions about our hike. I must have chatted with them for half an hour. Just as we parted ways, a familiar face came hiking up the trail. It was a hiker named Remedy. We had not seen him in over a month. We had to chat some more! 
Eventually we got moving once again, but shortly after we needed to stop for water. Other hikers were filling up there too, so more chatting ensued.
As we started north again, I fell in behind Remedy and was able to match his pace. We had a good conversation as we hiked and time went by quickly. The next thing I knew, it was 2pm and we had not yet eaten lunch. After a rest, Remedy continued on and I waited for Cole to catch up so that we could have lunch.
Before we could finish our lunch, drops of rain began to splatter on our laps, and our food. We finished eating quickly and then hurried on. Before we could get far, thunder boomed and lightening cracked. Not far ahead was a side trail to an ATC owned hiker cabin at The Blackburn AT Center. We decided that it would be wise to head for cover. It was a quarter of a mile down hill to the cabin. Nobody was there, but in the main house there was movement. Dripping wet and undoubtedly smelly, we stayed on the porch of the hiker cabin. Cole wanted to call it a day and stay the night. I was anxious to get closer to Harpers Ferry.
“There is a gas station with a deli that we can probably get to today”,  I told him. He was in. 
When the rain let up, we returned to the trail and carried on.
To reach the gas station with the deli we had to walk .3 of a mile up a busy road with no sidewalk and little shoulder. On Guthooks there was a word of caution about the road. Cars go fast, it warned. As we neared the road we heard a crash. Coming out onto the road we saw a car flipped over on its side just off the road. Two startled hikers were near by. The car had flipped just as it had passed them.
Choosing the side of the road that had a ditch, we walked very quickly and cautiously up to the gas station. Cole ordered a cheeseburger and I ordered a steak and cheese sub. The food was delicious.
By now it was 7pm. There was a Campsite two miles up the trail. We headed for that, but I wearied quickly. When we came to a stealth site a mile from the campsite, I called it quits. We set up the tent and went straight to bed.","Spout Run Ravine

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595317,"Today should have started off with excitement and high spirits,  but it did not. Mother and son were getting on each other‘s nerves. We only had about 4 1/2 miles to go to get to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. I sent out at seven hoping to arrive by nine but my mood made me sluggish. So did the rocks. And a steep descent. 
We met back up as I was crossing the Shenandoah River bridge. Blue blazes eventually let us from the AT to the ATC. We got our pictures taken and took a few ourselves, raided the hiker box for toilet paper, purchased a beverage from the hiker fridge, chilled in the hiker lounge and called to make a hotel reservation. They had a scale in the bathroom and Cole weighed himself. He is maintaining a weight of 130 pounds. I guess I must be feeding him just enough. He had been waiting for a few weeks to arrive here so that he could get a new hat. He chose a nice one from their limited selection and immediately plopped it atop his dirty, greasy head. I guess we will take that one!
After we had lingered for a time, we headed back out onto the AT and pointed our poles towards the historic downtown area. There we found an outfitter with sawyer water bags and a few limited Resupply items. We also found hamburgers at a quaint outdoor bistro.
Hotels in Harpers Ferry are pricy. Just over the river in Maryland the AT guide was showing a Knights Inn with a very reasonable rate. We crossed the Byron Memorial Footbridge and headed down the towpath. At first it seemed like we were going to have to go  all the way to Keeptrist Road and then backtrack a mile to get to the hotel. However, around mile 1026.2, Cole spotted what looked like a blue blaze. It led up to the railroad tracks. On the other side of the tracks we could see a trail. It seemed as though this trail would lead us very close to the hotel. We ventured off the AT and up the mysterious path. It was steep and strewn with broken glass, but sure enough it popped us right out onto a road. A hostel was right next to the path and our hotel was a seven minute walk away. Perfect! 
The rest of the day was spent relaxing. We picked up a few more food items from the gas station across the road and finished off the day sharing a bag of popcorn and a pint of ice cream. I guess we were at peace once again.","Mile 1019.2

Tucked inside a soft cozy bed with the buzz of the air conditioner filling the room, my eyes still popped open just after 5 AM. The birds have conditioned me. I decided to get up anyway and enjoy one more soak in the bathtub.
COLE ate and ate and ate his fill at the hotel breakfast counter. At least I didn’t have to worry about him being hungry for a few minutes.
We retraced our steps back to the trail that was beside the hostel and returned to where we had gotten off the AT. 
There were a couple of steep climbs , but for the most part, the trail was extremely flat today. The only thing to complain about is the rocks. There were a lot of them. Pennsylvania must be coming.
The miles ticked by quickly today. At one point I stopped briefly to take a picture of the trail. Every day I take pictures of the trail and the blazes along the way. You can see some of these pictures on my Instagram feed which is The_Canadian_Trekker. I have taken my trail photos from Georgia and compiled them into a video which is up on YouTube. Once I have completed the trail I intend to do the same thing for each state we have passed through. It is just too time consuming to work at on the trail.At any rate, I digress.
So .... I had pulled out my camera and was aiming it towards the trail in front of me to take a picture. I heard a hiker approaching me from behind. I  quickly glanced over my shoulder and caught sight of an awful lot of skin. I thought, my goodness he isn’t wearing much. I turned back to my camera to take my photo and suddenly what was in my viewfinder was a bare bottom. That was not the blaze I was intending to take a photo of! As he continued on down the trail the hiker hollered back over his shoulder “It’s hike naked day!”
“Yes, I guess it is,” I replied.  What else was there to say?
The back pack and butt crack continued on in front of me for a few minutes until naked hiker dude pulled away and disappeared. 
At lunch time Cole and I stopped at Gathland State Park. There was a bathroom and running water to fill our water bottles. Cole discovered that he only had one Croc attached to his backpack. He backtracked a short distance, but to no avail. I felt terrible because I am certain that I attached them to his backpack this morning. They are swiftwater crocs and he loves them. They are heavier than regular crocs but he was willing to carry the extra weight to have the shoes. Now he only has one.
We stopped briefly at Rocky Run Shelter for a break, then continued on to Dahlgren Backpack Campground. It is a free Campground with restrooms and showers. As we were eating dinner Cole suddenly lifted his hand to his head. His brand new hat was not there. He checked the tent. He checked his backpack. He walked back up the trail a little way to check the path. He checked the washrooms. Nothing.
“I think that I left it at the last shelter.” he said. It was two miles back. “Can I go back and check?”
“That is four extra miles!”
“I know.”
It was still early enough that he would be able to make it before dark, so I told him he could go. In about 90 minutes he returned, hat in hand. What a relief!
I handed him my small bottle of Dr. Broners soap and sent him off to have a shower. When he returned I asked him, “Did you learn a lesson today?”
“Yes, I did.” He replied.
“Good. Now where is my soap?”
“Oh. I guess I didn’t learn a lesson after all,” he said and retraced his steps back to the washroom to retrieve the forgotten soap.","Knights Inn

We hiked right on through to 2 pm when we stopped at Ensign Cowall Shelter for lunch. Then it began to rain heavily. A large group of hikers was gathered there, hiding from the elements. Two hours later the gathering had grown. It was crowded and we didn’t want to wait any longer. We decided to donn our rain gear and go five more miles before calling it a day. 
We were quite wet by the time we reached Raven Rock Shelter, but to my joy, my sox were only damp. Hurray for my new boots!
The shelter was very new and spacious with a covered porch and a polished floor. The rain was still coming down and the wind was blowing. Cole asked if we could stay in the shelter and I agreed.  It was a full house by the time we went to bed.
Somewhere around 1030 at night I awoke to the sound of screaming in the distance. I was also very certain that I could hear the growling of a bear. I sat up in my bed trying to listen more carefully. I quickly determined that the growling was actually snoring coming from the second level of the shelter. However, there was most definitely screaming coming from off in the distance outside. Heart pounding, I frantically begin feeling around for my headlamp. I couldn’t find it. I looked and looked and looked and wondered why nobody else in the shelter was stirring. 
Cole! Cole! Cole! I said shaking his foot, but he didn’t move either. Finally I just grabbed my phone and turn the flashlight app on and got out of my bed. I moved out onto the covered porch and looked off in the distance towards where the screaming had come from. There were tenters in that direction and I could see multiple headlights flashing amongst the trees. The screaming had stopped by now. Still nobody inside the shelter moved or spoke. I was still a bit spooked and watched the lights flashing in the distance not knowing what to do. Finally I decided that everything must be OK and I crawled back into my bed.
Them the lights from the headlamps flashed  across the deck as three hikers arrived. Two of them were helping the third.
“What happened” 
I asked.
A hiker named Beats had been sitting in his tent when all of a sudden a large branch came down off the trees and hit him in the forehead through his tent. Blood was gushing everywhere. He began screaming for help. That was the yelling that I had heard. Another hiker named Yodie rushed to help and a third hiker named Cruise assisted. Yodie seemed to have some first aid training. 
They sat Beats down on the floor at the front of the shelter and Yodie began cleaning the wound.  I got out of bed again and kneeled beside Beats and put my arm around him. He was very shaky.
Once he had been cleaned up Cruise and Yodie went to gather up the bedding so that all three of them could move into the shelter. I sat with Beats and rubbed his back. I tried to think of questions to ask him to keep him talking. I told him how jealous my son would be of such a long back rub. From his bed Cole  piped up in agreement.
Yodie and Cruise returned with all the bedding. Yodie had cleaned all the blood off of Beat’s air mattress for him. His pillow and his clothes were still covered in blood. 
They kept Beats awake a while longer, but eventually they settled in for the night. I tried to go back to sleep but I just laid there thinking how that could have been any one of us out there in the path of a falling limb.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595336,"This morning Beats said that he was feeling fine,though still stunned by what had happened. Surprisingly his tent was fully in tack. 
We set out to get to Pen Mar Park. We were out of food and needed to get to the Walmart which was two miles off the trail. I wasn’t sure yet how we would do that.
Shortly after we set out, it began to rain. Again. I hustled as quickly as I could, although I’m not certain why. Every inch of me was wet and I could not get any wetter. However, my feet only felt damp. They were not sloshing around in puddles inside of my boots. This is a big improvement.
When we arrived at Penmar Park there was a third hiker who had arrived ahead of us. Together we headed for one of the three pavilions to get out of the rain. As we approached the pavilion, the park caretaker hollered at us that the pavilion was reserved and we could not sit at it. I said we just want to get out of the rain for five minutes. He replied “the pavilions are reserved” and pointed us towards another covered area where we could sit. It was early in the morning, it was raining and the park was completely empty except for us....but the pavilions were reserved! Whatever!
A fourth hiker named Sista was already sitting at the covered Overlook that we had been directed to.  I mentioned to her that we were out of food and needed to get to Walmart. She said she was waiting on a ride from her cousin and we could go with them to the Walmart. The only thing was that her ride would be at least an hour. We were fine with that because it would take us about an hour to walk 2 miles and waiting was certainly preferable over hitchhiking. Sista’s cousin actually took two hours to arrive, but we were still grateful. She even offered to wait for us and return us to the park once we had finished our shopping. Awesome!
As we waited more hikers arrived and took up residence at the overlook. It had stopped raining by now and the sun was peeking out through the heavy clouds. The hikers just kept arriving. The care taker came over and lingered around. What was this group of rabble rousers up to. 
“If you need things from town, you just walk about two miles up that way.” He offered. He was thanked. Nobody budged.
Finally we saw Beats coming up the trail with a German hiker named Passenger. The gathering of wet smelly undesirables clapped and cheered him in. 
A sign on one of the buildings said First Aid. Basically it was just a first aid kit inside, but Beats was able to get his head cleaned up better. His gash was still bleeding. 
Beats and Passenger headed to town and slowly the gathered hikers dispersed, either heading to town as well or else continuing up the trail. Cole, Sista and I were soon all that remained. Cole and I used the power hand dryers in the park washrooms to dry out our socks a bit while we waited.
Sista’s cousin eventually arrived. She was a delightfully funny old lady. She even invited us back to stay at her place, but we declined. We did our shopping at Walmart as quickly as we could and then were driven back to the park. 
Back in the Overlook, we sorted through and repacked our food. We ate our lunch too. I had bought us ready made subs at Walmart. Cole’s was 18 inches long. He ate the entire thing. We also ate cupcakes and drank soda. Then we gathered ourselves together and prepared to hit the trail. It was 2pm and we had only hiked 5 miles.
Not far from the park we crossed the Mason Dixon Line into Pensilvania. Another state down.
After a few hours of hiking, we passed a southbounder who told us that there was trail magic a couple of miles ahead. The word “hamburgers” was mentioned. Our backpacks were full of food......but no hamburgers! We kicked it up a notch. 
At a road crossing we found a group of men under a pop up tent frying up burgers...and bacon. There was also home made goodies, pasta salad, vegetables and an assortment of other snacks. Cole ate two huge bacon cheeseburgers, plus an assortment of other treats. He drank two cans of pop.
 When we had arrived, one of the gentleman asked if I would like a pop.
“ What did you just offer me?” I asked with wide eyes and a big smile. A pop? Did you say “pop” and not soda? I must be home!” They all had a laugh. 
We stayed there eating and talking for well over an hour. By then the sun was starting to set so we continued on up the trail to the next shelter. There were actually two shelters. One was labeled snoring the other was labeled non snoring. Both shelters were empty. We selected the non-snoring shelter and settled in for the night. Not far off in the group camping area, a group of scouts was making a whole lot of noise. I stared out of the shelter watching the fireflies and listening to the noise and thinking what a wonderful day I’d had.","Raven Rock Shelter

Around lunchtime we arrived at Caledonia State Park. There were signs inviting hikers to a church picnic. We followed the signs and were welcomed into a pavilion where there were hamburgers, hotdogs, salads, fresh fruit, baked taters, and corn on the cob. There were no other hikers there at first, but soon a couple more arrived. We filled our plates and numerous people came over to chat with us as we ate, including a couple of young ladies who seemed particularly interested in Cole. Cole wasn’t much interested in conversation.
After our lunch we had two options. We could hike eight more miles to a campsite, or we could hike 10 more miles to a shelter. We decided to see how we felt as the day went on. Late in the afternoon the weather made up our mind for us. The skies started to grumble and drops fell from the bright blue sky.
The grumbling got louder and we decided to press on for the shelter. We had about 3.8 more miles to go. I tried to pick up my pace, but sometimes my feet and my legs just will not listen to my brain. In those instances I have to trick my legs into moving faster. So....
I’m a giraffe. I stretch my legs out far to make my stride longer. Step. Step. Step. But no, giraffes are graceful in their steps and I am not. So....
I am an Imperial Walker, unbalanced, top heavy and clumsy, taking big long steps and hoping not to topple. Big step, big step, big step! Pew pew pew as I shoot at the Jedi. 
Now I am a soldier marching to a beat. Left. Right. Left. Right. My arms swing and I lift my knees as high as I can...which isn’t very high at all. 
Now I’m in a marching band, leading the way. My trekking pole is in front of me moving with the rhythm. There is a bounce in my step and I hum a tune.
Ahhh... Now I’m a football player, butt down, knees apart, doing drills through invisible tires laid out on the ground. That movement is inefficient and totally drains my energy. So...
I am a train. My arms and poles move with the wheels.  I make a choo chooing sound which isnt too far from the huffing and puffing I am doing with all of this extra exertion.
The sun must have been entertained because it came out to watch me and the rumbling in the air ceased.
So tired now, and with the threat of rain apparently gone, I slowed down to my “I’ll get there when I get there” pace and arrived at the shelter in my own sweet time.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595863,"Ugh! I have a pack rash. It is a bright red band that runs around my hips and across my lower back. I know the cause too. Disappearing butt syndrome. I used to have a little shelf back there that my pack could rest on, but I’ve been walking my butt off and now it is gone. I keep having to pull my belt tighter and tighter to keep it around my hips.
Ok, I don’t really know if that is the cause, but it sounds totally plausible, don’t you think? There is less padding on my hips too. My body had definitely been transformed. I am not complaining.
This morning I smeared body glide on the rash before putting on my pack. We only had about 2.5 miles to go before the mid point on the trail. I was so excited! I raced out of the campsite and told Cole I would meet him there.
I came to a sign with a picture on it of the mid way sign. Say what?? Ah, it was last years mid point. Ours should be a little further ahead.
I waited for Cole so that we could see it together. Half a mile. A mile. Nothing. There was no sign at our midpoint.
I was standing there bemoaning the absence of a half way marker when a hiker came up behind me. I couldn’t believe who it was. Old Mountain Goat! You should be days in front of me! I exclaimed. He explained that he had taken a fall, hurt his ribs and had to take a few days off the trail. 
He kept talking and started hiking so I fell in behind him. This was normally a minimum 3 mile an hour hiker, but not today. I matched his pace and we kept on trekking. 
We passed rocks on the ground that someone had laid out to say 1100. I took a photo. Not far past that, the half way sign suddenly appeared. Hurray!!! In the log book, old Mountain Goat wrote his name and then I signed it with Still Sheila and Mountain Goat (young). We took photos, lots of photos. Cole was anxious to get moving. There was ice cream ahead. I wanted to enjoy this moment longer. It had taken a lot to get here!
Finally we moved on. Everyone pulled out ahead of me, but soon I caught back up to a backlog of hikers stopped on the trail. Something was in their path stopping them from proceeding. What was it? A rattle snake curled up on a rock sunbathing. One hiker coaxed it to move off the rock, but it was still next to the trail, holding its ground, unyielding.
Finally the backlog of hikers began moving in an arc around the rock on the opposite side from the rattler. It watched, never stopping the unnerving sound of its angry rattle.
When we arrived at Pine Grove Furnace State Park, there were a number of hikers at different stages of their half gallon ice cream challenge. Some looked like they would have no problem finishing. Others were struggling. We went into the general store and Cole picked out his flavour. Neapolitan. Wise choice son. I got a cup of salted caramel banana ice cream. I don’t know if I could eat a half gallon of ice cream, but I knew for sure that I had no interest in puking one up and that would surly be the result. At the very least, I would have to be done hiking for the day. So, I passed, but sat back to watch Cole. It was no challenge at all. His tongue got numb from the cold, but that was the worst of it. In less than half an hour he finished the tub plus the extra cup that makes up the half gallon.
Some hikers walked around holding their bellies. One was moaning that she felt sick. Not Cole. He was chowing down on French fries that a  camper hadn’t been able to finish.
The park had free showers so we took advantage of those. I found myself trying my best to wash my long curly locks with a bar of facial soap. For a towel I used a bandana. Hey, at least I was kind of clean.
With about seven miles to go to the next shelter, and a good part of the afternoon having been spent in the park, I thought that we were in for a late day. However the trail was relatively flat and the miles passed quickly. It was a good day!","

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595864,"There is a lot of planning and decision making that has to be done every day on the AT. How far to go. Where to stop. Where to Resupply. Where and when to rest. etc. Today we would be coming up to a 14 mile stretch that apparently had little to no water or place to stay. We could make it a short day so that we could do this section in one stretch. We could make it a long day (about 25 miles) so that we could get past this section to the  shelter, or we could take our chances and try to find a place to stop within this section. We picked option 3. It actually worked out really well. A user comment on Guthooks mentioned a stealth campsite that was about two miles further than I had hoped to go, but it would be a good backup if we didn’t find anything else.
In Boiling Springs we stopped in at the ATC headquarters, stocked up on water, picked up a few items from the outfitters and got some pop and ice cream from the corner store. Then we headed out onto the waterless stretch. We actually did find water, but it was either stagnant or in close proximity to pastures. However, not far from a road crossing, a trail angel had put jugs of water for hikers to fill up their water bottles from. How wonderful! As I had hoped and suspected, there were stealth camping spots too, but they were few and not very ideal. We came to a decent place to camp two miles from the spot I had read about on Guthooks. My feet were ready to be done.
“Let’s go the extra two miles,” Cole said. “Then we won’t have to do them tomorrow.”
Every other part of me, except for my feet, was in agreement. 
“ok” said my mouth.
“Noooo” screamed my feet. 
On we went. 
I was hobbling by the time we found the spot. It was a nice clear flat area under trees. To one side was a fence separating us from a field of cows. To the other side was a field of wheat. We were only .2 from the highway and we could easily see it across the pasture.  We decided  to set the tent up after dusk. In the meantime we cooked our dinner. A couple of cows approached the fence and watched us intently. Fireflies began dancing in the wheat. A couple more hikers came speeding by. We invited them to join us. There was room for another tent, but they wanted to press on to the shelter, even in the dark.
The cows retreated into the field and laid down. 
Finally we set up the tent and crawled into bed.","James Fry Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596020,"We had a goal today and a strong motivation to meet that goal. Get to Duncannon before 5 pm. 
Why?
Spaghetti of course!
Every Wednesday during June and July the Lutheran church in Duncannon offers a free spaghetti dinner to thru hikers. No, spaghetti is not usually very fancy, but for us it would be a gourmet feast.
 Up until this point Pennsylvania has treated us very well. We have had days of long flat terrain. We have hiked through numerous farmers fields and watched miles tick by with relative ease (albeit high temperatures and bugs)
Today began in the same fashion. Duncannon before 5pm would easily be within our reach. 
But then the trail changed. We began to climb. And then there were rocks. Rocks. Rocks. And more rocks. It began to rain. Rocks and rain are not a good combination.
At one point on the trail we knew we were very close to the town and we saw the trail leading us gently down towards what we believed to be a road. But wait. There was no white blaze. Apparently this was the way the AT used to go, but not any more. Off to the right, the trail begin another steep wet rocky ascent. And what did my eyes behold?  A blaze, of course. Up we went again only to reach a steep rocky descent. But we arrived in Duncannon with extra time to spare, so the trail blazers were quickly forgiven for their tortuous reroute.
We only needed a few items to restock our food. Mostly just snacks for Cole and breakfast items. We found these at the Sunoco and a corner store.
Before heading to the Lutheran church I wanted to make certain that we had a place to stay for the night. A fellow hiker told us that the pastor of a local church allowed hikers to sleep in his basement. We headed for the church. I was wondering how this would play out. Do we go into the church to inquire?  No need to worry. Hikers were sitting on the lawn at the house next door to the church. Bingo. Found it. This is one of the things that I like about hiking the AT. There are always other hikers around, especially in these trail towns, to help point the way or stumble through it and figure things out with you. Yet still, when on the trail, I can hike for hours and see no other hiker except for Cole. It is both solitude and community at the same time.
The lawn sitters pointed the way and down we went into the pastor’s basement. It appeared to be newly finished with clean laminate floors and a very modern bathroom with a big shower. There was a kitchen, a table and chairs and fuseball. And it was air conditioned. Oh such sweet cold refreshing air! It served two purposes, both lowering our body temperatures and reducing the funky hiker aroma in the room. 
Hikers had claimed their spots on the floor and we blew up our air mattresses to do the same. Then I showered. Cole was more interested in food than cleanliness and it was five minutes to five. So, back down the road we headed to the Lutheran Church. 
We arrived right on time, but inside hikers were already seated with overflowing plates. “Still Sheila! Look!” Hollered a hiker named Sunshine while holding up a meatball. We had hike together shortly today and had both expressed a longing for there to be meatballs to go with the spaghetti, or meat sauce at least. Anything with meat!
“Hurray!” I cheered because I totally am one of these trail weary, smelly (despite the shower), deprived (by choice) hungry vagabonds easily excited by this humble and simple expression of generosity (spaghetti and meatballs) from my fellow man. Except that it wasn’t simple at all. There wasn’t just pasta and meat. There was salad and a wide variety of drinks. There was garlic bread and an entire table dedicated to deserts. To top it off, there was a long stretch of tables covered in all sorts of items that hikers need. A sign above the table said “Free Resupply” Wow! We filled a zip lock bag with toilet paper, hand sanitizer, Advil, bug repellent, and snacks. 
We walked back to the pastor’s house full, content and happy and blessed. Cole had a shower and I crawled onto my bed very early. In the night lightening flashed, the air conditioner hummed and I snored.","Stealth Site at Mile 1131.2

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596039,"I fell today. 
Pensilvania was true to its reputation and gave us a rocky trail all morning long. At one point I was heading up a steep hill going from rock to rock. I couldn’t see a blaze, but there was someone in front of me so I kept going. We were both off the trail. The rocks were wet from the rain and my boots were not grabbing on to anything. One misplaced foot and I was teetering trying to catch myself. I failed. My foot slipped in an awkward direction and my arm slammed on the rocks. 
I just laid there.
Nobody saw. Nobody heard.
It felt like everything hurt. 
I thought about just laying there. Maybe someone would come along and pick me up.
Sheila, you twit. You aren’t even on the trail. Nobody is coming.
I  thought about two year old Cole running towards me with a huge smile, falling and then picking himself right back up. Did I ever have that kind of rebound?
Then I thought about two year old Evan, his twin brother, always trying to block my way whenever I had to go to work. “Don’t go momma!” He would plead. 
Then it was 13 year old Evan in my thoughts, hugging me when we last said goodbye. “You don’t have to hike any more mom.” Still he is not wanting his momma to be away from him. 
I tried to wiggle all of my different parts. Everything felt ok except for my arm and my right foot.
“You don’t have to hike any more mom.”
Then I thought of thirteen year old Cole, sitting on a rock somewhere waiting for his slow slow mother to catch up to him. He is so full of determination to reach the finish line.
Get up off the rocks Sheila. That is the only way to get Cole to the end and to get home to Evan!
I picked my sorry whimpy self up, found the trail and Cole and continued on. My foot, and my big toe in particular, throbbed. I numbed the pain with Advil.
We paused for a break at Peters Mountain Shelter and then set out to go seven more miles before calling it a day. Cole went ahead with instructions to wait for me at PA325.  I arrived and we crossed the road together. A roaring creek spilled over the trail on front of us. A white blaze beckoned us from across it. How on earth were we supposed to get there?
We followed the creek down stream a short way and found a family of backpackers. They told us that the spillway on the local damn had been opened and wouldn’t be closed until the weekend. They were going to camp out until the water went down. They also told us that hikers who had come by ahead of us had gotten a ride to the next spot where the AT crosses a road, thereby skipping 14 miles. Yet a third group had decided to hitch into town. There was no cell service by the creek. 
What were we going to do?
We sat down by the creek and I pulled out our dinner to cook while we discussed it. We couldn’t wait for days. We didn’t want to skip miles. We ate our dinner and decided that we would camp here for the night and see if the morning brought a change in the water level.
Cole set up the tent.
Then a hiker named lord Snow arrived. I passed on to him The information regarding the dam and the options which had been presented. He had his own solution in mind.
Further up stream the current did not appear to be as swift, but the depth was unknown. Snow took off his pack, headed upstream and then waded out into the flowing water. Within a few steps he was in over his head and trying to swim across. 
I stood there watching and thinking, I’m a dead woman. The current was going to wash Snow down stream, and although I am undoubtedly a much weaker swimmer and the effort would be futile, I knew that I couldn’t just watch someone drown and do nothing. I’d have to try to help. I’d fail. It all played out in my head it a long panicky five seconds as Snow fought the current. 
Then another hiker showed up, probably a much calmer and less dramatic hiker than me, I surmised as he laughed “There he goes!!”
Then Snow was back on the shore.
“We can probably swim across but our packs will be soaked.” He said.
The water was much more shallow right at the trail crossing, but the current was also the swiftest. Snow stepped out into the shallow water to test the current. He stepped again. Step. Step. Step. The water was clearly pushing him, but he was strong enough to resist it. Step. Step. Step. Then he was across. 
He turned around and crossed again. 
“You guys can make it. I’ll help you.”
“Are you going now or in the morning?”
“I’m going now.”
Tomorrow the water could be lower, but it might not be. We were being offered help today. Now.
“Cole, take down the tent. We are crossing now.”
Cole ran to pack up the tent he had just set up while I got to work cleaning up from our meal.
I put my phone and camera in a zip lock bag, then I took off my boots and tied them to my pack. I put on my crocs. I put on my backpack, leaving the waist strap undone. Then I approached the rushing water. 
Step. Step.
The current pushed. I pushed back.
Step. Step. Step.
I was across.
It was Cole’s turn. He approached the current with Snow at his side.
“Undo your waist belt!” I hollard from the other side. He couldn’t hear me above the sound of the creek.
I hollard louder and gestured to demonstrate what I was saying. Finally Snow directed him to undo his belt. Together they stepped out into the current.
Step. Step.
I could see Snow giving Cole directions but couldn’t hear what they were saying.
Step. Step.
Cole wobbled a bit, his arms flailing. Snow reached to steady him.
Step. Step. Step.
Then they were across. 
Not far from the creek we found a spot to set up the tent. I was still full of adrenaline, but it was quickly giving way to exhaustion. Cole was excited about what we had just done. 
“I guess that we have a story to tell now, don’t we bud! “
“Yup”
I listened for a while for the sound of others crossing the creek, but I heard nothing except for the rushing water.","Duncannon PA

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596049,"Neither Cole nor I slept well last night. My fall yesterday left me achy and sore. I am not sure why Cole didn’t sleep well and he wasn’t certain either.
I inspected my sore toe again. It looked perfectly fine. I could wiggle it with no problem. However, further up, just above my ankle was a purple swollen welt. On the other leg in almost the same position was a swollen bruise twice the size of the one on my right. How did I not feel those yesterday? They hurt to touch, but not with movement. Thank goodness!
I inspected my arm. Just a scrape. My big toe still throbbed. Cantankerous digit! Get over it!
We were slow going this morning. Thankfully the trail was fairly gentle. A long steady climb was followed by a long stretch of relatively flat terrain. A hiker passed me and I asked him if he had forded the creek. He said that the water had gone down over night and was no longer running over the trail. If we had waited the night on the other side, we would have crossed easily in the morning. No matter. We had chosen the sure thing rather than waiting for the unknown. Plus, fording it had added excitement to our day. 
The trail was wet from streams that had overflowed or redirected themselves down the trail. We had heard from a few southbounders in Duncannon about a couple of particularity deep spots that we would need to cross. We had hoped that these spots would be dry by now. We stopped to rest and use the privy at Rausch Gap Shelter. Another southbounder was there and he reiterated what we had already heard about the high water. He was a peculiar fellow, nothing like your typical thru hiker. He had a very small backpack and seemed ill equipped. He mentioned that he was going to try to catch a squirrel for dinner.
“Do you have something to cook with?” I asked
“Like a fire and a pot?” He asked.
“Ya, like that.”
“Sure I do.”
I pushed a package of instant potatoes and a few snacks over onto his meagre pile of stuff. I’m not certain any squirrels were really in any danger, but with all of the generosity out here on the AT, no hiker should ever let another hiker go hungry. Pay it forward. 
I set out from the shelter ahead of Cole who was sitting slumped over with his head down, snoozing. I reached the first water crossing. It appeared as though a beaver dam had broken and flooded the surrounding area. I was not going to be able to pass without water spilling in over the tops of my boots. 
Nope, that would never do. I knew how miserable I would be with wet feet. So, off came my boots and sox and on went the crocs. I crossed and found a place to sit down, dry my feet with a bandana and don my boots. I wondered how Cole would choose to navigate it. Then I wondered how long he was going to snooze.
He caught up to me as we were nearing the second water crossing. His boots were sopping wet and he was more awake than I had seen him all day. He was smiling.
“Guess who I saw!” 
“Who?”
“Steve! He has a trail name now. It is Blue Jay.”
Social interactions on the trail are rather unique. You spend time with a person, hiking together or just meeting up at shelters or rest spots. You might see them every day for a week. Then, for whatever reason, you don’t see them again. One of you went a little further one day or one of you hiked a little slower. They are still there on the trail. Somewhere. Then, days, weeks or even months later, you meet up again. We have had this happen many times and such was the case with Steve, aka Blue Jay. Our last spotting had been as we were waiting for the shuttle into Franklin and he was just coming back onto the trail. That was a long time and many miles ago. 
As we neared the raging creek that we were going to need to cross, we spotted Snow and another hiker on the opposite side. They had passed us earlier in the day.
“Were you waiting on us?” I asked, surprised to find them there.
“I was watching for you.” He replied. 
Across the creek someone had put a thin tree which reached from the shore over to a much thicker tree. Snow came over to our side of the thick tree and reached out to take Cole’s backpack across. Then he returned and steadied Cole as he crossed. He took my pack next and I followed behind. We all crossed safely and dry.
Guthooks was telling us that there was no water for a few miles so we decided to fill up. As we were in the process, a south bounder came along. 
“Ugh, how am I getting across that?”
“I’ll take your pack while you cross the narrow section and then I’ll hand it to you.”
“Great thanks!”
He crossed successfully but not before telling us that there was trail magic up the road. Down the trail he headed, but quickly returned two minutes later with another north bounder.  “I’ll take your pack...” he was telling the nobo, paying it forward.
The day was getting late, but we stopped at the trail magic for ice tea, water, chocolate, pretzels and conversation. Then we carried on for two and a half more slow miles before stopping at a tiny camping spot with room for two tents, ours and Blue Jay’s.","Clark’s Creek

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596255,"Hike your own hike. I’ve heard it a thousand times. It means do things your way and don’t be critical if the way other people do things is different. It is sometimes interesting to see how other people choose to do things and sometimes difficult to remember to make your choices for yourself and not based on what other people are doing. For example, sometimes we find people that we really like to hike with or hang out with at the end of the day. But, when their plans don’t match up with ours, we separate. It is ok to choose to alter your plans in order to keep in step with people, as long as that is the right thing for you. For me that mostly means having to go further or faster than I am comfortable with. So I don’t.  
I got going slowly this morning, but Cole was apparently slower. I made it all the way to William Pen Shelter and had to wait for him to catch up. Meanwhile a couple of other hikers caught up as well and a handful of hikers who were getting a late start to the day emerged from the shelter. They had somehow heard that there would be trail magic down at the next road crossing. Everyone headed out and I brought up the lead, as always. My nose told me long before my eyes did that there was trail magic. Something was on the bbq.
When I arrived at PA645 a large circle of hikers was sitting on lawn chairs feasting on hot dogs, watermelon, baked goods, chips, bacon and egg cups, popsicles and so much more. My son was among them and soon I was too. It was easy to sit there for a long time in the heat. Very easy. Cole was quite content and really didn’t want to move. I didn’t blame him. One hiker named Cyclops had two French braids in his hair. We started talking about hair and another hiker named Taco said that she would love to have her hair braided. “Cole knows how”, I piped up. She was happy to let him try. He had a difficult time getting the braid tight. One of the ladies who was hosting the trail magic offered to do it. She braided Taco’s hair and then she braided mine. She braided mine.I’m dirty. I smell bad. Very bad.  My hair hadn’t been washed in five days.....and she happily braided mine. It was better trail magic than the best spread of food we have ever been offered.
Two miles away was the 501 Shelter that had a free shower. That was our next stop. I eventually coaxed Cole to get moving on with me. He reached the shelter first and was in line for a cold shower. When my turn came I could barely stand under the flow long enough to get wet. I didn’t wash my newly braided hair. I couldn’t have brought myself to stick my head under that cold flow even if I had wanted to. I just tried to get the grime and stench off my skin. Putting back on my dirty clothing seemed to negate the process entirely. 
The afternoon was marching on but we hadn’t actually hiked very many miles. On we went.
A trio of hikers came up behind me and I let them pass, then I tried to keep in  step. I had chatted with them before and they openly included me in their conversation. This perked me up and helped me to move faster. They stopped at a swimming hole with the intent to stay the night. Cole and I ate dinner there and then moved on.
A few miles later, in a hot humid wet mosquito infested stretch of the trail, we decided we’d had enough. We found a campsite with one other occupant, Blue Jay, and quickly set up the tent and dashed inside to get away from the mosquitoes. We left the fly off the tent hoping for a cool night breeze to help us sleep.","Campsite at mile 1184.6

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596414,"Last night the sounds of fireworks kept us awake much later than we had hoped to be awake . The heat didn’t help our sleep either, nor did the sound of the mosquitoes that were angrily buzzing around on the other side of the tent mesh, their meal in sight but unreachable.
The wet bug infested stretch of trail continued on before us in the morning. So did the rocks. I used one trekking pole to steady myself over the rocks and the other one I shook in front of my face to fend off attackers. It was a slow frustrating trek. We were headed for Port Clinton only 16.5miles away. Mark and Evan were coming down to meet up with us again and would be arriving around 4pm.
Our pockets were filled with snacks which we nibbled on throughout the day so that we didn’t need to stop for lunch. We were anxious to see our family.
Have you ever wondered what you would do if a giant snake suddenly crossed your path? Well, I know exactly what I would do because one did. I gasped and yelled simultaneously producing an odd sort of yelp. It was loud enough for Cole to hear up the trail. I had come across a snake before, but it was no where near as big as this one. This one was longer in length than I am tall and as thick in diameter as my forearm. Cole called something back to me when I yelped, but I couldn’t make out the words. My sons like to watch a series of you tube videos that calls animals by funny names. Snakes are called Nope Ropes. I completely concur with this alternative title. It accurately expresses my feelings for the slithering creatures. 
Nope. Nope! And NOPE!!!
Thankfully this Nope Rope had no interest in me whatsoever and was simple just crossing the AT on his way to where ever.
When I caught up to Cole he said. “I heard you yell. I guess you saw the snake.”
“You saw it and didn’t warn me?”
He just laughed.
On we went.
Two miles from our destination I heard a hiker coming up fast behind me. It was Old Goat. We had seen him last in Boiling Springs where he was cutting his day short to give his ribs time to heal. I fell in behind him and tried to keep up. Obviously he was feeling much better because his pace was faster now, even over the rocks. We talked for about ten minutes and then I had to let him pull ahead. I couldn’t keep up. He was quickly out of sight. I wonder if we will see him again. 
In Port Clinton Cole and I found a picnic table to rest at. We had barely sat down when Mark sent a text saying he had arrived. We jumped up and hiked around the corner to our meet up point and were reunited with our family once again.

The last time our family came for a visit, we stayed at a campground close to where we needed to get back on the trail. By the time they went home, where we had reached on the trail was an hour drive away from the campground. This time we are staying at a campground an hour from where we need to get back on the trail and each day we will get closer to the campground  as we hike. So this morning it took an hour for Mark to get us back to the trail in Port Clinton. Since we needed to reach a spot where he could pick us up again, we had two choices. We could hike 15 miles to Hawk Mountain Road,  or 24.1 miles to Fort Franklin Road. We had never hiked 24 miles before, but 15 just didn’t seem like enough. We decided to go the further distance. With the rocky terrain, my top speed was going to be about two miles per hour. We didn’t arrive at the trail head until 8:30. I added headlamps to our small day packs and asked Mark to pick us up at 8:00pm Then we were off. 
The rocks don’t seem to slow Cole down much, but I find them torturous. Still, I kept moving forward steadily. The bugs were out again. I donned my new bug net and watched them hover around my head in front of it.
Ha bugs! Look who gets the last laugh!!
Actually, Cole was the one who was laughing when I tried to pop a chocolate almond into my mouth without lifting up the net. He had a bug  net too, but insisted that he wasn’t going to wear it unless the bugs were really bad.
At one of our meet up points I found him sitting with his net on.
“You’ve got your net on! I need a picture!”
“No, no, no.” Was his reply.
“But you look so cute!”
“How can I look cute in a big net?”
I held up my camera in selfie mode. When he saw himself on the screen, Cole laughed and I snapped the photo.
With about five miles left to go, I came across a porcupine hanging out among the rocks and chewing on leaves. I stopped to watch him until he either decided he had eaten enough or that my attention was unwanted and then he wandered off.
At four miles to our destination, Cole headed on ahead to the meet up point. It was a hot day and my bug net limited the air flow. I pushed it to the top of my head to take in a little extra air. About half an hour later I reached up to pull it back down again to fend off another onslaught of bugs. The net wasn’t there. It must have fallen off my head. There was no way I was going back for it. I guess that the bugs had the last laugh after all as they continued their assault unhindered.
1.3 miles left. I was so tired and anxious to finish. I couldn’t get my legs to hike any faster. In front of me was a long stretch of flat terrain with almost no rocks. I couldn’t walk faster, but perhaps I could run! It was unheard of! I trip so often, a trip while running would surly end in a fall. But, maybe if I was extra diligent in lifting my feet high and avoiding rocks, I could do it.
Oh just give it a try!
I ran. No more than .2, but I ran. And it was easy! 
I walked for a short bit, and then I ran again, laughing at myself in disbelief of what I was doing. I have never been someone who runs. I walk. Nothing more. Yet here I was after hiking 23 miles, running down the trail. 
When the parking lot came into view in the distance, I slowed to a walk. I didn’t want to scare anyone into thinking something was chasing me. Mark was there with the bbq frying me up a burger. I was exhausted, but proud of Cole and myself. Yes we were slackpacking but still we had hiked our longest day yet, 24.1 miles and I had run most of the last.","Port Clinton

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596583,"This momma’s heart is very happy today. My first born, Cole’s twin brother Evan, agreed to hike with me today. This is the same boy who adamantly refused to hike the one mile from the Springer parking lot to the start of the AT with me.  I am starting to believe that this was more due to him not wanting me to go on this journey than it was his reluctance to hike. But today he said he would hike a short section. 
Thunderstorms were in the forecast for the afternoon so a short morning hike seemed perfect. Instead of starting where Cole and I had finished off yesterday, we chose a 7.3 mile section that ended near the campground that we are stay at. The guide book indicated that in the section we were skipping over there was a rocky steep and difficult trail. I didn’t want Evan on that for his first AT hike. Cole and I will go back and do that section tomorrow.
I loaded up my day pack with snacks and four litres of water. It was a hot day and the stretch of trail we were on only had two unreliable streams that were a distance off the trail.
It didn’t take very long to drive to the start of the section. Another thru hiker was just arriving at the road crossing when we got there. He was looking to get to a restaurant, so Mark dropped us off and headed back down the road taking the hiker to his destination.
Despite skipping the difficult section, the trail still began with a very steep climb on rocks. Yikes! Not good for a hiker’s first outing on the AT. The terrain levelled out but the rocks continued for almost the entire stretch. Evan hiked with me for a bit and then decided to hike with Cole. After about ten minutes he returned to hiking with me. He liked my pace better. He stayed with me for the entire morning, hiking about a foot and a half behind my heels chatting the entire way. He talked about mine craft, pixel guns and the neighbourhood kids. He talked about more minecraft and grandma, the cats and then minecraft again. I told him how to read the blazes and we looked at millipedes and chipmunks. We drank the water, ate the snacks and sat on a rock to watch on my phone a you tube video that he wanted me to see. We sang a song. 
And then the hike was done. 
“Next time we come down, if you are hiking less than ten miles I might go with you again”, he told me. 
“Deal!”","Little Gap Road
",Smith Gap Road,"Jul 04, Wed",7.30
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596891,"Mark drove Cole and I back to Fort Franklin Road where we had left off two days ago. While there were a few flat easy parts, this section of the trail proved to be very difficult. I was so thankful that we were slack packing and that it wasn’t raining. It wasn’t just walking across rocks that was difficult. We were actually climbing up them and traversing their jagged edges from high elevations . At one point Cole fell and scraped his arm. He also broke his trekking pole again. He was able to shorten the bottom section of the pole and extent the top section to make it useable for the remainder of the day. It makes me nervous how he uses his polls to balance himself on the rocks.
We stopped at Bake Oven Knob Shelter for our last opportunity to fill up on water. 
Between Lehigh Gap and Little Gap Road there was a section of straight up rock climbing. I asked him to not rely on his polls. He said OK but kept using them. I told him, “Cole, rock climbers do not use trekking polls.” 
“What do they use?”
“They use in their hands.”
Finally  I took one of his poles away from him while he was climbing. He loved the rock climbing and scrambling. There was a time that I would have too but I was just so nervous about Cole falling again.
About four miles from our destination the terrain flattened out as it followed a long ridge above the city. A plethora of delicious raspberries lined the path. I was hoping that the rest of the way would be smooth sailing. No such luck. I took advantage of the flat terrain and ran until I was behind Cole. He turned and gave me a funny look. 
“Were you running?”
“Yup
When he had pulled a distance away from me again, I ran until I had caught up once more. This time he heard me coming and started running too, laughing as he lengthened the distance between us again.
The terrain soon became hazardous for running and I gave up on catching him.
The last mile was an agonizingly Slow one, but Mark was waiting with fried chicken and potato salad. A just reward for difficult day. Well, my tummy thought so anyway. My feet...not so much.","Fort Franklin Road
",Little Gap Road,"Jul 05, Thu",20.80
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596896,"Rocks, rocks and more rocks. Endless ankle twisting, toe stubbing, arch stabbing rocks. 
Rocks. Sharp, jagged edges always facing up. 
Rocks. Spaced so close together that it is impossible to step anywhere but right on top of them. 
Rocks among the grass. Rocks among the leaves. Rocks among the pine cones. Rocks among the rocks. Rocks. 
Mark and Evan dropped us off at the gap where we had ended with Evan two days ago.
After lots of hugs and kisses and prayers for safety we were off on our own once again. The forecast was calling for thunderstorms from 10 until one. We were hoping to make it to the first shelter before the rain began. I was so slow moving along the rocks. Other days we have had breaks in between the long stretches of rock, but not today. On and on they went.
We reached the shelter just as the rain began. It was very light rain, not nearly as heavy as had been called for. It didn’t last long either, but we stayed in the shelter for a long time none the less. I laid down with my head on my pack and dozed off a few times, waking abruptly whenever Cole would speak to me. We ate lunch there and finally moved back out onto the rocks.
I was tired. When I am tired I tend to not lift my feet up high enough or pay enough attention to the ground so I stub my foot. It is like kicking a rock. Pain shoots up my toes and they all complain bitterly, especially the big toe on my right foot which has not yet forgiven me for falling last week.
Soon I was limping and whimpering like an injured puppy. Cole wanted to push on further to the next shelter. I did not. There was a rock scramble ahead. I had no clue how difficult it was, but I was pretty certain that I shouldn’t be trying to attempt it when I was so tired and sore and already hurting myself more because of it. 
We came upon a campsite that was unbelievably rock free and set up the tent. In the distance we heard a noise. It sounded like a dog whimpering. We heard it again. Then again.
I think it is just the trees, Cole suggested.
Ya, probably.
There it was again. It was unnerving.
“Do you want me to go check it out?” I asked.
“Yes please.”
I was certain that it was the trees, otherwise we would have just moved on. But, to give Cole peace of mind (and maybe me too) I headed off into the trees. I was more nervous about what might be under the leaves as I bushwhacked my way towards the noise. Nothing jumped, slithered, hissed, rattled or bit me. Soon enough I was under the moaning tree. 
When I returned Cole said, “Since you are not dead, I assume it was the trees.”
I slept well, but Cole tossed and turned all night.","Smith Gap Road
",Mile 1285.8,"Jul 06, Fri",14.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596961,"We had a visitor before we set out on the morning. A hiker we have not seen in a long while stopped by our campsite for a chat. He is cool dude!The morning rock scramble was difficult, but still I was glad to be alert and in less pain for it.
I only had a few swallows of water left in my bottles when I headed out, but the next shelter and water source was only about three miles away. 
Before I got to the shelter, I happened upon a cooler and a plastic container. Inside the container there were four cookies. I held my breath as I lifted the lid on the cooler. Score! Gatoraid! I guzzled one. Trail etiquette would dictate that I only take one. The shelter was not far off. I ate a cookie, then a second, leaving two for Cole. Another thru hiker came up behind me and I pointed the cooler out to him. He ate the cookies. Sorry Cole. Then I totally broke the code of etiquette and guzzled another gatoraid. 
Cole caught up to me at the shelter. I filled the water bottles from a nearby tap. 
Another hiker arrived, but not a thru hiker. He looked out of place and my “weird” detector activated. This guy still had store tags hanging off of his backpack, and he asked a lot of questions. I may have come across as a little standoffish. I was trying to be polite and figure him out at the same time, all the while trying to keep as much information to myself as possible until my radar stopped going off. He moved on before too long.
The trail was much kinder to my feet today but they still felt beat up from yesterday. 
We began coming across a lot of day hikers as we approached Delaware Water Gap. Our noses are very sensitive to detergents and deodorant now. The smell was strong all around me. Surely nobody could smell me when they walked in a cloud all those scents.
We came across weird hiker dude again. Among all of these day hikers he suddenly seemed to fit in. My radar shut down and we chatted for a while. He told me about the hostel we were near. I said that it would be too early for us to stop for the day.
“But you could have a shower.” was his reply.
Zing!
There goes my theory! I couldn’t smell him. He didn’t smell like soap, but he didn’t smell like a hiker. Well actually, I can’t smell hikers. 
We did go to the hostel, but only for water, rest and a washroom. Chill was there, trying to decide if he would spend the night. He was suffering from a shin splint and needed to recuperate. Meanwhile he decided to head down the road for pizza. That sounded great to us so we joined him and the three of us split an extra large pepperoni pizza. Afterwards we stopped in at the outfitters and picked up another pair of darn tough sox for Cole. One of his pairs had mysteriously disappeared. Then we were back on the trail crossing the Delaware River and leaving Pensilvania behind. Thank goodness! 
Climbing up out of the Gap there were just as many day hikers as there had been descending into it. However, the higher we climbed the the more they thinned out. 
We had our sights set on one of three campsites that were marked on Guthooks. Cole didn’t like the first one, so we moved on to the second one. It was occupied by a friendly section hiker named Tyler. There was still room for us and my feet were spent, so we set up the tent and called it a night.","Mile 1285.8
",Campsite at mile 1303.2,"Jul 07, Sat",17.40
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597007,"Our neighbor, Tyler, was still snoring in his hammock as I headed out in the morning. Cole was slow moving and even though I packed up most of his things, he wanted 45 more minutes before he had to start hiking. 
Thirty minutes bud. You need to get moving within thirty minutes. 
He reluctantly agreed.
We have been lacking a variety in scenery lately, but today we had some nice views as we hiked along the side of the mountain we were on. There was a bog too. They can actually be pretty despite their horrid name. Bog. 
I got my nose a bit out of joint today, but I was careful to bite my lip and keep my thoughts to myself. I was filling up my water bottles from a trickling stream that was coming out the side of a rock. Someone had kindly added a leaf spigot. A weekend hiker saw me and took the opportunity to school me in the need for water filtration before consumption. 
Ok, I know that even after 1300 miles there are many things I could still learn. For instance, when Mark was visiting, I foolishly decided to send home my quilt. It has been so hot and I have not used it and I was tired of carrying an unused item. I decided that some warm sleeping pants,  my fleece and liner would suffice if it got cold at night. Well last night it got cold. Cole was under his quilt and I was shivering in my sleeping bag liner. We were sleeping head to foot and he did not have his toe box done up. That is a lot of unused quilt just lying there, I thought. I kept inching in closer and closer to his feet trying to get one measly corner of his quilt over my shoulder to steal some warmth. You might be able to guess the results. I got kicked in the head. Then he rolled over taking the extra corner of the quilt with him.
So you see, there are still many things I need to learn, but the need for water treatment is not one of them.
I smiled, because I also know how to use a filter on my mouth, and then politely told him that I would be using purification tablets in the water since my son currently had our filter. My nose was quite crooked during the explaination. I could feel it. Would he have said anything if I were a guy? Could he not see the bright orange tag hanging off my backpack that screams to everyone “I hiked here from Georgia!”
Sheila....he is just trying to help.
But why? Because I am a lone female hiker so I must be dumb?
Maybe I was just tired. 
I reached a fairly steep and long incline. I’ll show him. I motored up that hill like a boss, putting to work my powerful leg muscles that had been honed on mountains in the southern states. But of course, weekend hiker dude never saw because I’d smoked him long ago. Silly Sheila. Out here among other thru hikers I’m the weakest and slowest of the bunch with no right to any kind of ego. 
By lunch time, nine miles down the trail, Cole had still not caught up to me. I sat on a rock by a roadside to wait. Eventually he arrived, just behind Box Turtle, a thru hiker we have been keeping pace with for a few days. We ate lunch, had a nice long rest and then continued on. 
A few miles up the trail we found a trail magic cooler with gatoraid, beer and fruit. Nice!
We came upon a dung beatle pushing his little ball of poop northbound toward Katahdin. This time I took a video of the little guy. Cole found a few more of them just at the beginning stages of forming their balls from a pile of poop along side the trail. Smelly work!
With about four miles left to go, Cole went on ahead to the shelter. My feet were really aching and I was hobbling slowly. At one point I decided that I wanted to sing to make myself feel better, so sing I did.
Loud rustling in the bushes interrupted me. I could tell that it was something big. My first guess was that I had come across a hiker who was digging himself a cat hole. ( Maybe after the dung Beatles I had poop on my brain) I resumed my singing to make him aware that he was about to have company. 
Then I saw his outline through the trees. He was a great big black bear, twice the size of any we had seen in Shenandoah.
I began yelling at him as loudly and forcefully as I could, trying hard to keep my pitch low and forceful. 
“Get out of here bear. Get a move on!”
He turned and looked at me. Then he huffed at me.
“Don’t you huff at me! Just get out of here! Go! Go away bear!!”
He started walking away from me following along beside the trail. I kept yelling. He crossed the trail, turning to look at me again. Huff Huff.
“Don’t give me that attitude! Just get a move on!”
One more huff, then he kept moving away from the trail and off into the distance turning only once to look back at me. I just kept yelling until he was out of sight. 
I was excited to tell Cole about my encounter when I arrived at the shelter. A sign on the shelter warned of an active bear in the vicinity. There were way too many mosquitoes to stay in the shelter though, so we set up the tent.
I packed up the food bags after our dinner, scouring my pockets and backpack for any scented items. Cole is always supposed to do this as well. In fact, at the last trail magic there was a garbage bag and I asked him to empty out all of his garbage into it.
Then we went to sleep. 
Sometime in the night I was awakened by the sound of footsteps outside of the tent. I bolted upright, as did Cole who had obviously heard it as well. 
We unzipped the fly and shone our headlamps into the darkness. Cole was certain he saw something. 
“I’ve got garbage in my pockets.” He suddenly declared and proceeded to rummage madly among his things. In every pocket, corner and bag he pulled out a wide variety of wrappers and smelly objects, enough to fill a large zip lock bag. He grabbed a headlamp and took the offending objects over to the bear box. We settled in once again to go to sleep.
It wasn’t long before the footsteps returned. We shined our lights outside once again and listened to the footsteps slowly saunter away.
We can’t sleep here!
We quickly shoved all of our things into our backpacks and hauled them up to the shelter. The shelter was empty and it had a nice sized covered porch. We returned for the tent and without taking it down relocated it to the porch. Cole usually likes to sleep with his head near the door so that he can get a bit of a breeze on his face. The door was facing the top of the porch stairs so he elected to face the other way.
“I don’t think I will be able to sleep mom.”
“I don’t think a bear will come up the stairs hon. Just try.”
Neither of us slept well.","Campsite at mile 1303.2

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597075,"My bug net came back to me briefly today. This morning a hiker named Moses caught up to me and said my name. When I turned around he passed me the bug net.
“What? How?” 
He said that he was walking down the trail being pestered by bugs thinking how he really needed a bug net. Then, low and behold, there was one laying in the middle of the trail. Cole had seen him with it on and had told him that I had lost it.
I handed the bug net back to him. “It’s yours now. You needed it. It’s yours.” 
What a great outcome to the story of the lost bug net. lol
We had motivation to move quickly today. In High Point  state park there is a concession stand. It closes at 6pm and it was almost 19 miles away. I don’t like rushing and my feet hurt. I was totally lacking motivation to hike. I was tired after last nights excitement. I decided that in order to get myself moving, I was going to have to have something to drive me. I decided that something would be a burger. So I hiked with purpose, barely pausing for breaks. I drank lots of water with electrolytes and “energy” additives, and I hiked my heart out. 
My feet and toes complained a LOT and I downed more Advil than I should have just to be able to keep moving. And I hiked. 
Stubbed my toes and cried in pain. Nibbled on snacks, and skipped lunch. And I hiked. 
Paused briefly for a banana and cranberry juice trail magic, and I hiked. 
We made it to the concession stand by 5:20. I ordered two cheeseburgers, cheese sticks and cokes. The burgers were measly and overpriced, but boy did I ever work hard for that meal. Two other hikers arrived not long after we received our food and they tried  to place an order. They were told it was too close to closing time to get hot food. Oh the disappointment! One settled for ice cream and we decided that we needed that too. 
High Point Shelter was only .8 away from the park so that is where we headed for the night.
As I lay here typing this, my last dose of Advil has begun to wear off. The cost of that burger is being exacted. It wasn’t really about the burger though. I’m getting bored with the scenery and anxious for something new. I have had more than enough of the rocks. New Jersey is no better than Pensilvania. I know that there are better things ahead and I am excited for them. I just need to get there. Somehow. No, making my feet worse won’t get me there. I need to take care of my body better. I have a mental battle to fight too though, and today the only way to win it was to aim for that burger. What will it take to win it tomorrow? I don’t know, but I do know this, it won’t involve getting anywhere fast.!!","Brink Shelter 
",High Point Shelter,"Jul 09, Mon",19.60
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597085,"I was feeling much better this morning than I had anticipated I would be. My feet were very sensitive to the rocks but the bottom of my foot below my toes did not rebel at every step like it had been doing  yesterday.
In the morning I started out hiking with Moses who slowed so that I could keep in step. 
On the Guthooks app there is a shelter marked  that is not an official Appalachian Trail shelter. It is called the secret shelter. I told Cole  when I headed out that I would meet him at the junction of the AT and the blue blaze leading to the secret shelter. However, I was so caught up in conversation with Moses that I completely missed the junction and had to turn around and backtrack .3 of a mile. Cole caught up to me and we headed for the secret shelter hoping for a shower. The shower was cold, which did not surprise us, however it was outside in the open with no privacy whatsoever. Neither of us wanted to use it but I did convince Cole to at least wash his hair. I’d actually had a shower at the state park yesterday, but he had not. We were also able to briefly charge our electronics.
A few more miles up the trail we took another side trip. Unionville was .7 miles off the trail but we needed to Resupply. A nice deli sandwich was calling to us also.
The Resupply options were very meagre and extremely expensive however the sub was huge and delicious.
The Mercury was soaring and we were not anxious to get off the shaded porch in front of the deli. They too had an outlet for hikers to charge their electronics.
Eventually it was time to move on.
I enjoyed the scenery today. We walked around Wallkill Reserve. It was wide open, unshaded from the blazing heat, but it was a change of scenery. We also walked along a long boardwalk which I loved! So did my feet! There are no rocks to stub my feet on along a boardwalk. 
Then we were back out into the woods and hoping to find water. Cole was ahead of me and suddenly I heard his squeeky crackling voice yelling “Go away bear.” I ran up to where he was, adding my voice to his as I ran. When I reached him he said”It’s ok mom. It is gone.”
I peered off into trees and saw two black faces staring back at me. They were much smaller than the bear I had seen the other day. Juveniles perhaps?
“No it isn’t bud, and there are two of them.”
Cole raised his trekking poles and clanged them together. There was something about that sound those bears did not like at all. On the first clang they turned and ran. We decided to stay together after that. I was tired and feeling spent, but we needed to find a place to pitch the tent. We found a spot at the base of Wawayanda mountain and started to unpack, but then stopped. Cole was nervous about the bears. The group that we had camped with the previous night had indicated that they were going to camp at the vista on the top of the mountain. It was only about a mile away, but it involved a steep climb up the side on a path called “stairway to heaven”. Plus, the sun was beginning to set. We would have to move fast. It was a risky move. I couldn’t see anywhere in the guide book or on Guthooks that there would even be camping spots up there. What if the group ended up going elsewhere.
We decided to chance it and began the steep climb.
We passed a few day hikers coming down. I asked one if he had seen any other backpackers. He told us he had, and that one had even set up a tent at the top. He gave us directions how to find them. This relieved my worries greatly. I also asked the day hiker if he had passed a spring on the way down.
He said yes, but he was certain that I didn’t want to drink that water and he offered me the little bit of water he had left in his Nalgene bottle. I politely declined.
“ You’re going to drink that water over my tap water?”
He just didn’t understand.
We found the spring, collected a few litres and climbed some more. Finally we found a little circle of tents and the group we had been looking for. They were sitting out on the rocks enjoying an immaculate view. In the distance we could see lightening striking. The sky rumbled a bit, but the view was clear. The sun set.
It had been a long day, but the finish was spectacular.","High Point Shelter
",Pinwheels Vista Wawayanda Mountain,"Jul 10, Tue",20.30
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597280,"Cole  tossed and turned all night last night. The tenting space we were in was very small and our neighbors were literally inches from us. I am afraid that we both kept our camp mates up.
What I like about camping with other people is that you can swap ideas and plans for the day. I had not noticed in the AWOL guide that we would be passing a creamery and a hot dotg stand today. Our camp mates had not noticed that we would also be passing by a state park with washroom and outdoor tap. I look forward to small luxuries such as this.
I headed out for the day and Cole caught up to me about half a  mile before Wawayanda state park. My T-shirt was smelling so bad that I could hardly bear to put it on in the morning. So, after I had used the facilities, I whipped off my shirt and gave it quick wash in the bathroom sink using hand soap. I then put it back on. Almost daily I put on a wet shirt in morning, but it is a sweaty shirt that has not dried over night. It was easy and refreshing to put on a wet shirt that had be hand washed. It was a hot day and it helped to cool my body temperature down. We both also took the opportunity to use the sink to brush our teeth. What luxury.
Once we had our water bottles filled we headed back out on the trail. The next destination was the New Jersey New York state line. The AWOL Guide cautioned of a long stretch that although it appeared unassuming on the elevation chart it was actually a series of short but difficult rocky hills. It was very slow going and involved a lot of climbing up and butt scooting down. It was also quite hot because a lot of it was out in the direct rays of the sun. The rocks were big and smooth and round and my feet did not mind them at all.
We had our site on hot dogs and ice cream for lunch around 1 PM however  because I was so slow on the rocks,  the time kept getting pushed back. At 2 o’clock I realized that the hotdog stand would be closing in one hour. We still had 3.2 miles to go.  
“Cole, can you go 3.2 miles in under an hour?”
“Yes!”
I handed him money.
“Go!”
Like a flash he took off.
“Don’t run on the rocks!” I hollard after him. He yelled something back, but I didn’t hear it.
I kept trudging on, not knowing if I would be getting hot dogs or food from my backpack for my next meal. I really hoped for hot dogs. 
When I reached the hotdog stand, there was Cole waiting with my dogs and coke. He had arrived five minutes before closing time. The gentleman who owns the stand was still there and he put my wieners back in the hot water to warm them up. He also chatted up a storm. He is in his 80s and has been running a hotdog stand for almost 20 years.
Five minutes down the road there was a creamery. Once I was done my dogs we headed that way for dessert. It was delicious. The creamery was very hiker friendly and even had a charging station for hikers.
It was hard to get moving again but we eventually did. There were more rocks to climb. At one point when I  came up on Cole he was frantically waving his arms and trying to pantomime something. All I could discern was that there was something sleeping that he did not want me to awaken. I creeped up as quietly as I could, but as I peered into the crevice Cole was pointing out to me, a copperhead snake lifted its head and stared me down. 
Oops! I snapped a photo and we moved on.
Our destination was Fitzgerald Falls. I had read on Guthooks  that there were many camping sites. It was correct. Only one was occupied. A father and son had set up a tent and they had a huge fire blazing. It was so hot outside I couldn’t understand the rationale of the fire and I was a bit worried about all of the dry trees around us. We set up our tent a good distance away. When Cole went out to hang our food in a tree, the father came over to inquire what he was doing. Cole explained it to him. The dad then decided that they would not stay for the night. He said that they would come camping again when they knew more about what they were doing. Eventually they put out the fire and left.
As it got dark and we were trying to sleep Cole was disturbed by the many different sounds he heard outside. To him every sound sounded like a bear. All I heard were squirrels in trees and falling nuts and branches. We went out a couple of times to shine our light in the trees, but we never saw anything. It took Cole a very long time to fall asleep.","Pinwheels Vista Wawayanda Mountain
",Fitzgerald Falls,"Jul 11, Wed",17.50
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597281,"This morning I asked Cole how he was feeling. He took a long time to answer, but eventually replied “I feel like hiking.”  A better reply may have been “I feel like climbing” because that is what we did for most of the day.
I had my mind set on going 19 miles so that we could get to an overlook where we could see the lights of the New York Sky Line. Once I began all of the rock climbing and realized once again there was a lot of it and I was going very slowly, I had to let go of the idea of seeing the night skyline. Once I was able to let go of the idea, I enjoyed my hike much more.Every day I have to remind myself to only try to do what I can comfortably do and stop pushing for more. It’s hard. Sometimes I feel like I am missing out. Wouldn’t it make the day more enjoyable if we could get up there for the view? But, would it be enjoyable if I was in a lot of pain when I arrived or too tired to care about it? 
I also want to connect with other people more and do some of the interesting things they are doing, but I also want to stop thinking I need to do what others are doing and just do my own thing. It is such a paradox!
In the morning as I was hiking along, I came to an abrupt stop. I had been watching the rocks to keep an eye on my footing. The entrails were the first thing that I saw, but my brain did not register what they were until I looked a little higher and saw the head. What on earth would rip a raccoon in half like that? And where did the bottom half go? I turned away quickly but pondered it for a long time. Wouldn’t a predator prefer the entrails over the furry hind end? It was just strange.
The blazes were faded in a lot of places today and sometimes there weren’t enough of them. At one point I thought I had lost the trail. Guthooks showed that I was right there on it, but I couldn’t see any blazes. I sat down to wait for Cole. He found the blaze immediately. I had looked in every direction except for one. Up! We had to climb the rocks straight up. How did I neglect to look there? We had been climbing up all day!
There was no drinkable water on the trail today. The sources were either dry or stagnant. Thankfully trail angels had left water caches at road crossings along the trail. The first one had plenty of water and we filled up our water bottles. The second and third cache had only empty jugs. We were quite thirsty by the time we reached the next cache and were relieved that it still had some water. 
Near the end of the day we had to venture a quarter of a mile off trail to a state park in order to get water. I rinsed my shirt out in the bathroom again and put it on wet. It really helps to lower my body temperature when it is so hot outside. There were vending machines at the park too. I cooked our dinner there at a picnic table and we enjoyed overpriced pop, candy and ice cream from the vending machines.
The shelter was just four miles away, but it was late in the day. I covered the first three with relatively good speed, but for the last mile my feel felt like they were walking on glass. I am still kicking rocks from time to time and each kick is more painful than the last. 
Cole went ahead to set up the tent as I laboured with every step. I arrived just as the sun was disappearing beyond the horizon.
There were a half dozen other tents set up. We wouldn’t be alone and perhaps Cole would sleep better. He did inform me before he dozed off that he had lost a camp shoe. Again.","Fitzgerald Falls

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597957,"I was excited to get going today. There were a couple of stops along the way that I was looking forward to. One was Bear Mountain and the other was the Trailside Zoo. It also didn’t hurt that there would be a concession stand. Resupply options have been either very poor or non existent close to the trail lately. However the opportunity to buy a meal along the way fills our bellies and stretches how far we can go with what we have in our packs.
We began with a steep climb up a stone staircase. There were many more throughout the day. A banner near the trail read “Long Distance Trail Crew. We rock your trail.” 
“Ah ha!” I thought to myself. “A confession!” I had always suspected that that rocks on the trail were placed deliberately to torment hikers and now here it was in print. “We rock your trail.” See! They do put the rocks there!!!
Ok, actually it is this crew that is responsible for the stone steps that we climbed today. What a tremendous amount of work and a beautiful job they have done.
Somehow at the start of the day we missed a visitor centre that would have had a vending machine and possibly water. We went 8 miles without finding any water along the trail. Finally we came to the top of bear mountain. Where there was once a washroom there were now only Porta pottys so there was no running water. However they did have expensive vending machines. But, what do you do when you are a parched backpacker? You pay up! And so we did.
Then back down hundreds of steps we went to Bear Mountain State Park where we found a picnic table full of thru hikers. Apparently we had just missed out on a trail magic barbecue. A couple of the hikers ( Hobbit and Moses) had packed up some of the leftovers and they shared them with Cole and I. We each got a hot dog, a hamburger, chips, lemonade and we split a banana. After a nice rest and some socializing we carried on through the park. We found the concession stand, but our bellies were full...almost. We found a little extra space for ice cream. We also found a water fountain to fill our bottles.
Just past the state park the trail went through the Trailside Museum and Zoo. The Zoo was small. The animals who live there are native to NY and were either injured or orphaned and unable to live in the wild. There were two foxes that just looked so sad. We did not take the time to explore the various museums that they had there. 
After crossing the Hudson River we climbed climbed climbed back up into the forest then  down once more where we came to our first opportunity to Resupply in days. A gas station!  Hmm...I remember when I was complaining about having to Resupply at Dollar General! If only I could get to one of those now!!  The gas station was actually quite prepared for the onslaught of the thru hiker bubble. They carried quite a bit of the usual fare..tortillas, spam, tuna, and all of the other things that we are pretty much sick of. I was easily able to get Cole restocked on snacks, but what about “real” food? After humming and hawing and walking in circles around the isles I finally picked up a loaf of bread, a container of peanut butter and a glass jar of jam. A glass jar. Am I nuts?!?  Probably, but I am going to be nuts with a happy belly full of PB and J. 
The gas station also had a deli. There is no shortage of delis in New York. We both had a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato, bacon and avocado. It was delish!! 
We only had a short distance to go to get to our final destination. There is a monastery that allows hikers to sleep on their property ( it’s a field). It has port-a-potties, a charging outlet, potable water and a cold water outdoor shower. I tried to have a shower, but despite the heat I couldn’t get myself completely under that cold water. Instead I used my shirt as a wash cloth and gave myself a sponge bath. I probably should have tried harder to soak myself in the cold water. I have a heat rash covering both of my legs from my ankles up my hips. It flairs up during the day but fades a lot during the night. 
Cole attempted to have a shower too but only succeeded in sticking his head under the cold flow. 
Oh, I have another ailment from the heat as well.  The bottom of my backpack rubs against the top part of my butt and with all of the heat and sweat it has caused a sore. On the trail they talk about getting “monkey butt”. I think this is from your butt cheeks rubbing together as you hike. My sore is slightly different. Cole says it should be called “baboon butt”. We laughed long and hard over that.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597998,"I was tired today and my right foot was complaining a lot too. Sometimes it feels like cracked glass and I am certain that if I kick another rock it is just going to shatter.  We had talked about taking a zero today on the monastery’s property, but in the end I decided that I was ok to keep walking. The heat drained the energy right out of me, but I still enjoyed the trail. We saw a lot of old stone walls which really intrigued me. Were they built for defensive purposes? Were they merely property markers? Why were they out in the woods? Why did some look like haphazard piles while others looked thoughtfully crafted? I will have to delve into this mystery and find out.
Not far off the trail today was Clarence Fahnestock State Park. It had a concession stand so we decided to stop in. Cole went on ahead to make sure we got our food ordered before they closed. When I arrived at the concession stand, Cole wasn’t there. A couple of other hikers who we knew ( Pumpkin Spice and lord Snow) were hanging out at the picnic tables and I asked them if they had seen him. No. 
Um, now what? Worry was building, but not for long as I saw Cole quickly approaching with his long hurried strides. He had taken the wrong blue blaze. Some day hikers had eventually sent him back to the right path.
After our meal it was time to get moving again. The state park offered a free night of camping to thru hikers, but staying would have left our mileage short for the day.
We had been seeing signs along the trail about a weekend event involving trail work and a hiker feed at the RPH shelter, but I wasn’t certain I could make it that far with my aching foot. As we climbed up and across Shenandoah mountain with the painted US flag on it, it began to drizzle. A bit further up was a tenting area and that is where we called it a day. The tenting area was actually a well groomed lawn in front of a boarded up building. The grass was lush green and felt wonderful under my feet. It was level and cushiony, a tenter’s dream. Beside the boarded up building was a covered patio with two aged picnic tables. A well maintained privy was not far off. We had all of this all to ourselves. 
The drizzle stopped long enough for us to get the tent set up. Cole hung the food bags and was back inside the tent just before a thunderstorm began. We slept well.","Graymoor Spiritual Life Center

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598001,"I didn’t wake up until 7am this morning. Usually I am awake around 5. The floor inside the tent was wet from the storm. I had gone to sleep without putting all of my things away properly and so now all  of my dry pairs of sox were damp. What should I wear? The damp blue sox, the damp purple sox, or the damp black sox? Oh the decisions.
The air mattresses were wet on the bottom. I hate packing them up that way. That was the worst of it so I guess we made it through the night ok.
I thought that I was feeling pretty well when I set out two hours later than normal. About a mile and a half up the trail I came to RPH Shelter. There was a lot going on there. A dozen or more volunteers were working around the property and they had trail magic for hikers. I had fruit and gatoraid, chocolate and a wrap. Cole arrived and ate too.
Not long after I set back out, I started to feel poorly. My legs were heavy and my pack felt like it weighed a hundred pounds. My head started to ache and I felt a bit dizzy and nauseous at times. To add insult to injury, a wasp decided to take offence to my presence and stung me as I passed by. I sat down on a rock to treat the sting.
Cole caught up again and I told him how I was feeling. We had only hiked 4.4 miles and I had drank almost two litres of water so I wasn’t sure that dehydration was the cause. We had been out of electrolyte additives for a few days.
We walked a few more miles and I begrudgingly decided that I needed to stop. My foot was so sore. It was all just too much.
Cole said that he was tired too and didn’t mind taking a short day.
There was a shelter a few miles ahead. We decided to stop there. Why do I feel so bad about only hiking 10 miles? I’m worried that I won’t feel better by tomorrow. 
When we had the tent set up I crawled inside for a nap. We were set up near the shelter and I was awakened by an unpleasant discussion between a husband and wife. He was whining....”I don’t want just peanut butter! “ 
Oh my, it sounded like a teenager!
And then a few moments later...
“Could you make me one please?”
A soft voice replied “The honey is all crystallized.”
I decided that was the end of my nap. I did feel a little better. I picked up my phone to check Facebook and discovered that our friend Old Mountain Goat had quit the trail. I felt terrible. He was a strong and determined hiker, always seemingly able to overcome  injury and press on. If someone like that can’t finish, how can I? 
I laid back down, still tired and sore.","Shenandoah Tenting Area

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598014,"I had a long sleep last night and I feel so much better today. I didn’t think my mood or energy level would turn around so quickly. It just goes to show how important a good night sleep is.
As I was packing up to head out, the husband and wife came over to the shelter. He was still whining. And whining. I was standing right there in plain sight, but I guess that he didn’t mind an audience. He whined, he cussed, he whined some more while she sat quietly. Finally he said that he was going to file for divorce when their hike was over. I was rather uncomfortable as I busied myself packing my things. Thankfully Cole was off getting water and didn’t have to hear it. I gave him a great big hug before I set out and told him that I love him. We might not always be the best hiking partners, but there could be much worse!
I had a really good morning of hiking. My foot appreciated every flat and smooth stretch we came across. Boardwalks through swamps are now a lovely thing to me. A trail around a lake was peaceful and pretty. 
When we reached a giant (oak?) tree there was trail magic. We sat for a nice long rest, cold drinks, a banana, a muffin and a bit of chocolate. Then we carried on. 
The trail was still very dry. When we reached highway 22 there was a garden centre that the AWOL guide said was hiker friendly. A lengthy list of rules for hikers was posted at the entrance, and in the washroom, and on the gazebo and in half a dozen other places. I was grateful to be able to fill our water bottles there, but the long list of rules and the watchful eye of the owner didn’t make me very inclined to stay long. If I am welcome, shouldn’t I feel it?
Just down the road across from the trail head was a food truck. Cole and I both ordered something. The food was delicious.
Wiley Shelter was our original destination. Another shelter was only four miles further up the trail. Our plan for tomorrow is to head into Kent to have a shower, do laundry and Resupply. Rain is in the forecast. Cole and I were both feeling well enough to continue on to the second shelter, deciding that we would be grateful tomorrow to have a shorter distance into Kent in the rain. Going the extra distance also meant crossing into Connecticut today. Marking another state off the list always feels like a small accomplishment and a reason to pat ourselves on the back. A nice shoulder massage would have been preferred, but a pat would suffice.
Let’s go to Connecticut dude!
And we did.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598033,"First thing this morning my foot gave me a proper scolding. I muffled it’s voice with a double dose of Advil.
Last night I was reading a lot of comments about the town of Kent. None of them were positive. It seems that according to previous backpacker’s  experiences, Kent is unfriendly to hikers. The laundromat in particular had a bad reputation. Ugh! If we could skip the town, we would. We smell awful, to the point where we can’t stand ourselves. We are also almost out of food. We must go to Kent. The town is .7 off the trail, plus there would be walking from one amenity to the next. The only accommodations in town where steeply priced. Once our chores were done our options would be continuing north to the next shelter 7 miles down the trail, or backtrack southbound .3 miles to a shelter. I suppose stealth camping was also an option, but it is illegal in Connecticut. We decided to just play things by ear and see how the day went. 
There were a number of steep climbs along the trail and so we were going much slower than we anticipated. The sky rumbled over our head. 
I was apprehensive as we finally descended down to the road to town, and I whispered a soft prayer “Lord please take care of us in Kent.”
There was a vehicle parked on the road side where we emerged from the forest. A woman was sitting in the driver’s seat with the windows rolled down. As I walked past she leaned over and asked “Do you need a ride to town?”
“Yes please,” I replied. “That would be wonderful.”
She glanced over at Cole who emerged from the woods behind me.
“ Are you the mother who is hiking with her teenage son?” she asked.
“Yes I am.” I replied and I introduced myself and Cole. Her name was Susan. Apparently yesterday while I was ordering food from the food truck Cole had chatted with a father and son hiking team. They were her husband and teen and they had told her about us. They were slack packing today along with a second son, and she was waiting for them so that she could resupply them with water. Not only did she offer to drive us to town, but she offered to take us to all of the places that we needed to go and return us to the trail. First she dropped us off at the IGA so we could buy our resupply items. She went back to the trail with the water for her family and then returned to the IGA to pick us up. Next we headed to the laundry mat. As we were talking she suddenly asked “Would you like to come and spend the night with us in our RV?”
I could hardly believe my ears. I was sitting in the front seat and I turned behind me to see Cole’s reaction. He was frantically nodding his head up and down.
“ We would like that very much.” I replied.
At the laundromat there was no washroom or place to change into our rain gear. Except for sox, underwear and recently a second shirt,  we do not carry extra clothes. The second shirt is actually a luxury and a weight penalty. Everything we were wearing needed to go into the wash. So, on laundry day we wear our rain gear. Mine was in rough shape with the entire crotch area held together with duct tape. Susan drove us over to the Kent welcome centre where we were able to use the washrooms to change. She then returned us to the laundry mat to do our laundry. By then it was pouring down rain so we didn’t feel quite as awkward in our rain gear.
Inside of the laundry mat was a machine that dispensed coins for the washers driers and soap. I tried inserting all of my small bills but each one in turn was rejected by the machine. Finally I inserted a $20 bill. The machine poured forth a pile of quarters and Susan B Anthony coins. Cole and I laughed harder and harder as it spat out coin after coin after coin.  I could just imagine the weight that the excess coins were going to add to my pack.
I snoozed a little while the clothes were washing. On the dry cycle I ran out in the rain to get Cole and I food. We unloaded some of the coins into the laundromat vending machine.
When our laundry was finished, Susan drove us to the outfitters to scope it out. We then drove to the trail head where her husband and two sons were finishing their hike for the day. Their RV park was an hour and a half away from Kent. On the way there we really enjoyed the conversation that we had with Susan and her family. They stopped and treated us to pizza for dinner. It was a bit late by the time we reached their RV. Cole and I both had showers in the RV with a towel! Unless we are staying in a hotel,  we don’t generally have a towel to dry ourselves off with after a shower. We use a very small multi purpose absorbent cloth. The towel was big and soft and warm and dry. Cole slept on the couch which he said was the most comfortable couch he had ever laid on. I slept in a loft above the back of the toy hauler. It was a good sleep. 
Thank you Lord for taking such good care of us in Kent!","
",Kent CT,"Jul 17, Tue",8.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598059,"I slept well last night and even slept in a little this morning.
In preparation for hiking the AT Susan and her family had freeze dried a lot of food. Initially there were supposed to be six or seven people in the family hiking the trail, but now there were only three. They had a lot of excess freeze dried food. She gave Cole and I some to take with us.
We had an hour and a half drive back to the trail head. On the way we stoped at a pharmacy so that I could get some more Advil for my foot.Susan dropped off her husband Tom and her two boys at their trail head first. On the way to our drop off point she asked us if we would like to slackpack for the day to give my foot a break. She would be hanging around the area all day anyway waiting for her crew. 
Cole emptied most of his pack into the back of Susan’s Jeep, keeping only what we needed for the day; snacks, water, bug spray, bug nets, seat pad. I stuck a water bottle in one pocket and my phone in the other. I took two Advil, threw the container into Cole’s backpack and then we were off. 
All I had on me was a water bottle and a phone, but I quickly became tired and sluggish. We’d had a late night, but I still I felt I’d had enough sleep. I could barely keep my eyes open. I drank water and ate up all of my snacks trying to wake myself up. What was wrong with me?
There was some climbing, but also a lot of flat ground. One long flat stretch led us along side a gently flowing river. It was a beautiful day.
When I felt the pain in my foot increasing I retrieved the Advil from Cole’s backpack to take a second dose. Why are they a different shape than normal, I wondered as I poured two out of the container. Then I noticed what it said on the bottle. Advil nighttime sleep aid. I had taken a sleep aid before I had begun hiking this morning. What a twit!! No wonder I had been so tired and sluggish. I put the Advil away and embraced the pain for the rest of the day.
We were a bit late meeting up with Susan. One of her boys was with her. He had hurt his leg while hiking so his mom had picked him up early. We sat with them and talked for a while. I told Susan about my Advil misshap and she gave me a container of Aleve. Finally we gathered up our gear and set back out on the trail with our full packs. The next shelter was only one mile away, but it seemed to be a very long mile. At one point I couldn’t see where the trail was, but then discovered it squeezing through two halves of a seemingly broken boulder.
Pine Swamp Brook Shelter was a mosquito infested nightmare. We hurriedly put on our bug nets, but when Cole went digging for the bug spray he came up empty handed. He had left it on the trail some time during the day. I was a bit irritated. Could we not get through at least one week without him losing something? 
A better question might be why was it so easy to get irritated after I’d spent two days being blessed with kindness from a perfect stranger?

",Pine Swamp Shelter,"Jul 18, Wed",17
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598129,"I was still irritated with Cole this morning and I’m certain he was equally unimpressed with me. He treats the outdoors like his bedroom   and half the time just drops things where he finishes with them. This is how he loses things so frequently. This morning he had the contents of his food bag scattered about as he searched for a particular snack. Once found, the contents laid there waiting for him to feel like gathering them up.
This morning I told him that from now on he will have to pay to replace whatever he loses. He had a smart alec comment and I responded in kind. I asked him to finish packing up and be on the trail in 10 minutes.There was very little left to do as I had already packed up most of his things and half taken down the tent. 
I headed out grumbling and swatting as a thick mass of hungry blood suckers tormented me. I hiked slowly. Two hours later Cole had still not caught up and I was out of water. I sat down by a stream and waited. And waited. 
Eventually he appeared leisurely strolling down the trail. I   was relieved. We gathered and filtered water then continued on. 
At the next road crossing there was an auto sales shop that had a pop machine out front. It had a sign on it  addressed to hikers that said “Coke machine works”. Good to know! They had a bench for us to sit on and a crate for the empty cans. We sat, rested and drank our pop. All irritability had drained away.
Further down the trail we had another long and lovely walk along side a river. Benches were strategically placed along the path to provide resting areas with views of the water.  I wanted to sit, but just kept moving. When I was in the process of researching the AT, I read something that I either took out of context or completely misunderstood. Or I suppose it could also just have been a hoax. It said that there was only one bench  on the entire length of the trail. I had passed this information on to Cole. We quickly discovered that this was just not the case. In areas that are popular for day hikers we often find a lot of benches. When we do find a bench, Cole likes to tease me. “Oh look mom, another bench.” If I had been a day hiker, I definitely would have stopped and sat on every single one of those benches and admired the view. I may even have brought a book and enjoyed a lengthy repose. But, I am not a day hiker. I am a thru hiker and I need to keep moving.
We paused briefly for trail magic, a gator aid and a snack, and then we found a lovely spot overlooking a waterfall to have our lunch. We are still eating PB and J and enjoying it.
Near the end of the day, not far from our destination, we  had a very steep rocky uphill climb. While stopped at the trail magic a south bounder had mentioned a spectacular view that we would be coming up to. She said it was the best view of any we had seen yet. As I climbed and climbed, I silently hoped this was it. I could hear voices at the top. Finally I reached the summit and I was not disappointed. Was it the best view I had seen to date? I don’t think so, but it was pretty spectacular. A group of day hikers was chatting with two section hikers. I took pictures and joined the conversation. The day hikers gave us fresh fruit and cheese to lighten their load before descending. Cole arrived behind me and we took more photos. 
The sun was getting low in the sky and it was time to get moving. There were two shelters close by spaced only 1.2 miles apart. The section hikers were headed for the second shelter. Cole and I were headed for the first. Cole went on ahead and I followed. When I arrived at the side trail to the shelter, Cole had set up the tent right at the trail head. In a tenting area near the shelter there was a ring of tall tents set up. Clearly not thru or section hikers. From the tents came the loud and boisterous sound of young people.
“Oh” I said.
“Should we go to the next shelter?”
“I’m too sore.”
Guthooks indicated that there was a beautiful view from the shelter so I went to check it out. Getting there involved a rock hop over a stream. The shelter too was full of teenagers.
When we settled in for the night the group must have gathered by the shelter and they were far enough away that we couldn’t hear them. Once we were sound asleep, they returned to their tents where they proceeded to shout back and forth to each other waking us up.
“I want to move.” Cole said sleepily.
“It’s too late now.”
We laid there late into the night listening to crude humour and immature ramblings. Eventually they fell silent and we dozed off.","Pine Swamp Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598146,"Maybe we can sleep in, Cole had said last night. No such luck. The noisy teens were up surprisingly early. Before we even crawled out of our beds, the whole procession was packed up and tromping past our tent. Then it was perfectly silent.
“Are they gone?”
“This early? They can’t be.”
I got up to retrieve the food bags from the bear box. Sure enough, they were gone.
We had more steep climbs today and were rewarded with majestic views. There were difficult and slow rocky descents as well.
After filtering our water at a stream I continued on while Cole packed up. I expected him to be on my heels shortly. He was not. I hiked along a ridge line admiring the beauty and hoping he would catch up soon so we could share the moment. Still no Cole. He sometimes lags behind a bit if we are at odds, but we weren’t. Finally I stopped and sat to wait. Was he digging a cat hole? Did he stop to talk to someone?
Finally I took my pack off and leaving it behind I retraced my steps along the ridge line. Eventually I found him limping towards me with blood streaming down his right knee. He had fallen on his climb up and had sat down on the rocks to compose himself.
I took him to where I had left my bag and I cleaned the blood off his leg and hands. It didn’t look nearly as bad once it was clean. It was cut and scraped and maybe a bit swollen, but he said that he was feeling ok. I was upset. I spend so much time worrying and stressing, always fearful of exactly this. We had already had a discussion about how the terrain was going to be getting more and more difficult as we move further north and that I would want him to stay with me. I think now is a good time to start staying together, I told him. I expected a complaint, or at least a sour face. Instead he said “Maybe if I am walking slower with you then I will fall less.”
“You are probably right bud.”
“Will I have to change my trail name?”
“Why would you have to do that?”
“Because I won’t be climbing the mountains fast like a Mountain Goat  anymore.”
“You’ll always be a Mountain Goat hon.”
“Ok.”
We found a really nice place to stop and eat our lunch. It was an unmarked shelter with an excellent view. User comments on Guthooks called it a secret shelter while another commenter said that it was not intended for overnighting in. It was perfect for shading us while we ate. 
Cole took off his shoes and sox to air out his feet. The stench quickly filled the partially enclosed space. I encouraged him to put on a clean pair. He was going to shove the putrid ones into his bag. Ugh! 
“No, no,” I said. “Why don’t you hang them on the outside of my bag.”
I have an extra strap that goes around the outside of my bag that I often hang clothes from to dry or air out.
When we got back on the trail we joked and laughed about the horrid smell the socks hanging from my bag were leaving in my wake as I hiked. If Cole walked too close to my heals the smell of the sox made him gag. If I turned around too quickly, my nose would be were the sox had just been and my face would contort at the smell. Twice today Cole’s nose started to bleed. It does that sometimes when the air is dry. It was funnier though to blame it on the sox.
The shelters are really weirdly spaced out on this section of the trail. In order to stay at a shelter we either had to do a nine mile day or a twenty-four Mile day. Neither of those worked. Some of the hikers we talked to were going into town where they offered free tenting at the community Center. The town was three miles off the trail. Although stealth camping is not allowed in MA (we had crossed the border earlier in the day) we decided that it was our best option. As the sun was setting, in a heavily mosquito infested area we found a flat piece of ground tucked under a pine tree. We ate bread and cheese for a quick dinner and crawled into our beds as the mosquitoes buzzed outside.","Riga Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598165,"When deciding  where we are going to stop each day I usually just use my AWOL guide to see what is ahead to make a rough plan. For today I had marked in my book that we should head for Shaker Campsite. However, this morning when I took a closer look at our route on Guthooks I discovered that there have been multiple incidents at that campsite with a sow and her three baby cubs. It was strongly recommended that hikers avoid that campsite. This meant a shorter day for us as we ended our hike at Mt Wilcox North Shelter. Cole and I stayed together for most of the day, although there was little in the way of rock climbing. We had a nice long lunch break at Tom Leonard Shelter and a short rest stop at the first South Wilcox shelter. All of these shelters had signs posted warning about active bears in the area. If we’d had any inclination to go a bit further and stealth camp again, these warnings quickly squashed it. We were content to just go the 14.8 miles and have a rest at the end of the day. My feet were happy for the break. The Aleve    that Susan gave me has actually been working better than the Advil I normally take, but I’m still hiking in pain. 
Rain was in the forecast and Cole wanted to sleep inside the shelter. The mosquitoes were very active and I wanted to be in the tent.  There were a lot of other tents already set up. Nobody was in the shelter. 
We waited until later in the evening and then put the tent without the fly into the shelter.  Admittedly,  in consideration of other hikers, this is not a good practice, but there was still a lot of room in the ten man shelter and we were prepared to move out if need be. Three more people did end up arriving and there was lots of extra space. 
It was a cold night and as I have been doing on many nights since sending my quilt home with Mark, I found myself scrounging around for something to give me a little extra warmth. This time it was the rain fly. It worked great.","Under a pine tree at Mile 1520.4

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599038,"We woke up to a wet morning. Sometimes when you sleep in the shelters the sound of the rain is very loud inside. I didn’t hear it at all last night.
Our destination today was highway20 in Lee MA where we would be meeting Mark and Evan. They would be there by 4pm but I had my doubts that we would be. I have been moving even slower than normal and haven’t even been able to muster up two miles in an hour. Cole was either really tired or just anxious to see our family because after only nine miles he asked if we could just get dad to pick us up now. 
Sorry hon, but dad isn’t even in Massachusetts yet.
Our food bags were pretty empty when we dug inside them for lunch. We scraped enough peanut butter out of the jar for a sandwich with jam. Still hungry Cole turned to the Nutella jar and scraped it clean spreading the contents onto a slice of bread. He added jam to that. 
“Mmmm! That’s good!” He declared.
I pulled out two packages of spam and we ate them straight from the packaging. We crunched on a few crackers. I still had some powdered milk and carnation instant breakfasts that Susan had given me. I mixed those up too and we drank it down. And that was lunch. What a weird combination of foods.
With two miles left to go, Cole ran ahead to the road. To get to the parking area he crossed a road and took a blue blazed trail about .2 miles. Then he crossed the road back again to the parking lot. Mark, wanting to meet me on the trail, headed up the road to the trail head, but by the time he got there I had reached the blue blaze. He went about half a mile southbound before I texted him to come back.
Food was first on the agenda. All day breakfast at McDonald’s sounded really good, so McGriddle it was. Then we checked into the Travel Lodge. Cole had a shower, then I made a beeline for the tub and didn’t emerge for a very very long time!","

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599039,"Yesterday I stayed in the hotel room all day with my feet up. Mark took the boys to run a few errands and I napped. He returned with Epson salts and I soaked in the tub again. 
This morning we checked out of the hotel and relocated to the same Campground that Susan and her family have their RV at. It is not far from the trail and when we slack pack tomorrow and Thursday we will be hiking closer and closer to the campground. 
Mark set up our big tent ( which he calls “The Cabin”) and I napped. In the evening Susan invited us to the RV for dinner. We had a wonderful meal with her, her husband and two sons. It was another enjoyable restful day. I am not sure that my foot is feeling much better though. I will know once I start hiking.","Lee MA

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599043,"It poured down rain last night, but we were warm and dry in “the cabin” and I had no worries about packing up a wet tent. It really is a completely different world out on the trail. Even slackpacking while car camping can’t compare. In the middle of the night as the rain pounded on our sturdy shelter, my bladder let out it’s nightly wake up call. I certainly wasn’t going outside  in that rain, so I did something I have never done before. Our family tent has an enclosed front room. We use it like a mud/storage room. I got up, went in there, closed the flap and peed into a Gatorade bottle. Yup, I did. See what living in the woods has done to me. Doing that in the little tent I share with Cole would be impossible though, so my nightly trek into the trees even when it is raining will have to resume when Mark leaves. 
Mark drove us back to the trail crossing at highway 20 and we resumed our hike. In the rain. Hiking in the rain is a completely different experience when you know that there is a hot shower and dry clothes waiting for you at the end of the day. 
The trail was very quiet all day long. We crossed paths with two south bounders, and only came upon one northbounder at the end of the day. 
My foot was still bothering me. We had intended to hike through to the other side of Dalton, but bailed as soon as the trail met up with the sidewalk. 
On the way back to the campground we stopped at Walmart to shop for our Resupply. Cole never likes this part of the journey and he didn’t want to come inside to pick out what he wanted. So, I told him that his snacks would be on the slim side and he would have to eat what I bought without complaint. He agreed, never lifting his eyes from the electronic device he was starting at. I know right now that this won’t turn out so well. It will end in both of us being grumpy and a .....”well then you should have come inside to shop with me.” 
The day ended with pizza, a shower and a dry warm bed, but my thoughts were with those hunkered down on the trail.","Lee MA
",Dalton MA,"Jul 25, Wed",19
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599421,"Mark dropped us off where the trail emerged from the woods on the outskirts of Dalton and we hiked through town. Where the trail follows a sidewalk we often see citcular metal emblems recessed into the concrete. White blazes will be painted on light standards. I remember seeing a post once on an Appalachian Trail Facebook page. The poster lived in a trail town and a white blaze was painted on a light standard in front of her home. She talked about how so many people drive or walk by without having a clue what the small white rectangle means, while to her it was a daily reminder of a dream that she had yet to fulfill. As we walked by the houses I wondered what the people inside thought about the bubbles of backpackers who seasonally emerged from the woods and crossed by the front of their yards. Did they peer out their windows to watch them pass by, admiring the strength and determination that had brought them this far? Or did they glare at the smelly dirty figures that strode past, hoping they would just keep going? Mostly I suspect they are indifferent.
It was raining again and like yesterday, the trail was quiet. In the afternoon the sun emerged and we arrived at another trail town, Cheshire. The trail went right by the front door of an ice cream shop, and who do you think we found congregating there? Backpackers, of course! We only recognized two of them. 
A bit further up the trail we found some trail magic,  and then we began to climb Mount Greylock. The trail was muddy, wet and steep, but the sun was shining. An entourage of nobos passed by us one by one. Even though we had no packs on they were moving faster than we were. Why does that matter to me? I’m still moving forward. I’m not giving in to the pain or giving up. I am going to keep moving forward. Why should I let irrelevant things like that matter? 
I don’t know.... but I do.
I was so happy to reach the parking lot and get off my foot half a mile from the top of the mountain.  Mark was there waiting.
When we got back to the campground, I showered and then Mark and I spent the evening sitting with Susan and her family outside chatting. There were two other hikers there as well, Kraft and Black bird. I should have been packing.","Dalton MA

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599422,"One of the errands I had sent the boys on four days ago was to pick up a new pair of hiking pants for Cole. The bottoms of his old ones were being held together with duct tape. The knees had holes from various falls. They went to Dicks Sporting Goods and came back with a pair. Mark sprayed them with permethrin. When Cole walked by me this morning with them on, I could see his ankles.
“Um, dude, those are too small for you.”
“No they aren’t.”
“Yes they are. I can see your ankles. Did you show dad when you tried them on!”
“No.”
“Well, you’re stuck with them now”
His sox are long and his boots are tall, so I guess that he doesn’t look too much like a hobo.
Goodbyes seem to be getting harder. Mark drove us to near the top of Mt Greylock where we had finished yesterday. Evan wanted to know how much longer I would be hiking. “Six weeks hon. That is all.”
 It was sunny and bright, but not too warm. There is a war memorial at the top of Mount Greylock with a tall tower above it. We climbed up to the top of the tower with our packs on. (Why we didn’t leave the packs at the bottom I don’t know.) The views there were obscured through dirty windows. Back outside of the memorial I took a few pictures at the overlook and then we moved on.
The trail was wet and we were doing a lot of decending. One small slip landed me on my tush. At another spot I was placing my muddy boot onto a waterlogged plank of wood. A little bit too much forward momentum landed me sprawled in a position that would have been just fine had I the elasticity  to do a forwards splits. But alas, I do not. Recovery was quick, so I guess I didn’t pull anything.
We passed a pair of section hikers who stopped to talk. They were just finishing up their section hike and had been trying to give away the remainder of their freeze dried food. I said that I would take it since it is light. They pulled out a big bag of different dehydrated items and handed it to me. Afterwards I told Cole that he would be able to eat to his hearts content at supper time.
We walked through a small town, and found a lady handing out lemonade and little Debbie’s to hikers. Someone stopped by to warn us that a severe thunderstorm would be coming through between 3 and 6. It was already 2. 
We quickly passed through the town and returned to the trees where we at least had some cover. The sky soon began to rumble. Eventually the clouds  opened up and dumped their contents on us.  The heavy downpour didn’t last long, but for the next few hours it alternated between sunshine and light showers. 
At one point I felt a stinging sensation under my arm. It looked and felt like I had been stung. I put anti itch cream on it which just made it sting more. It was quite swollen and red. I pulled out my benidrill. The first two I pushed out of the wrapper crumbled on contact. I guess they have been in my bag too long. The next two came out in tact. The benidrill didn’t seem to do much for me either.
About an hour later I felt the same stinging under my other arm. What are the chances that I would have been stung in the same place under both arms? Slim! It wasn’t a sting after all. It was a rash from wet arms and friction. 
Before reaching the shelter we crossed into Vermont. We also began a section of the AT that overlaps with The Long Trail.
When we reached the shelter another hiker gave me diaper rash cream to put on my sore arm pits. When that was absorbed and it began to sting more, I put body glide on it.
The shelter and the surrounding campsite were packed. It was the largest congregation of hikers I have seen in a long time. There were North bounders, South bounders and hikers doing The Long Trail. 
It was raining and we did not want to sit out in the rain to cook food. We ate a cold dinner deciding to have a big hot meal for lunch tomorrow instead.","Rockwell Road

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599430,"I decided something today.....I’m not a fan of Vermont!
My arms stung all night from the friction rash. My kind neighbour gave me more diaper cream this morning to put on it.
Most of the trail all day long was covered in water and mud. With his new boots on Cole feels invincible and just plows down the middle of the trail through the watery mess. I am hoping to get a few more miles out of my boots, but the rocks in Pennsylvania really did a number on them and they are no longer waterproof. Mark bought me some shoe goo so I can seal a few spots up again, but the boots need to be dry to do that. From the looks of the trail today, I would say that dry boots are not in my near future. So, I hop from rock to rock to rock.
The trail was so busy today. When we stopped for lunch at Congdon Shelter, the shelter and surrounding area were full of other hikers having their lunch too. There were NOBOs, SOBOs and people doing The Long Trail which follows the same path as the AT for 100 Miles.
For lunch we cooked up three of the meals that the section hikers had given us yesterday, one chili and two oatmeal. There was another hiker at the shelter who had also been given a big bag of food from the same section hiker. We laughed at how much food those hikers must have started with (though I am often guilty of the same thing....having too much food!) 
In the afternoon a storm moved in and unloaded more rain on us. It was short lived though and we hoped that would be the end of it. 
We had a steep rocky decent to VT9 and then a steep climb back up the other side. The sky rumbled for almost two hours, but in the end it was nothing more than empty threats. What did it matter anyway? My feet were wet, my clothes were wet. Cole had packed up a wet tent this morning so it was already wet too. What more was there to get wet? This was day four of wet. Lucky us had the first two days slackingpacking and we had dry clothes waiting for us. Clearly some of the long faces I saw today had been out in it for four days straight. 
We found ourselves a nice place to set up the tent up on Porcupine Ridge with a bit of an overlook. I hung a few things outside but really had little hope that they would dry.","

Well, it isn’t the waking up to them that I like. That part actually sucks because everything is wet. But hiking in it, that is another story. Cool air. Picturesque forest. Wonderful. Sloshy muddy wet trail. Not so wonderful. I am getting faster at navigating my way through the mud though. But....beware of the faux rocks! If something looks like a rock but it isn’t actually above the surface of the water, test it with your pole first. I learned this the hard way!
I was mostly successful at keeping my feet dry though. We stopped for a rest at Goddard Shelter and the sun was shining brightly down onto part of the deck, so we took off our boots for a while and laid out our sox. While there we met a Long Trail Hiker named Paul. He was quite interested in our through hike and had a lot of questions for us, which we didn’t mind answering. 
We dried out our sox some more when we stopped at Kid Gore Shelter a little while later for lunch. Then one more time at Story Spring Shelter. It would be nice if the shelters were spaced liked that every day.  Cole stayed with me for most of the day and we had some good conversations. I really like this way best. Cole seemed to enjoy it today too. Possibly because he was tired and not feeling like going very fast.
We ended our day a few miles past Story Spring Shelter at a camping spot by a stream. A large group was already camped there when we arrived and among them was a face we have not seen in a long time. Matt or Show Pony as he goes by now. Cole enjoyed hanging around him, but we lost him in  Waynesboro Virginia.

Climbs, yes, but they were neither too steep nor too plentiful to tire me out. Although still muddy, the trail and I engaged in a kind of waltz, leaping, jumping, sidestepping, tip toeing and hopping along. Though still sore, my feet stayed dry.
We climbed a fire tower for an incredible 360 degree view above the tree line.
On Friday my monthly cell phone service ended and I have been unable to get a good enough connection to have the service reactivated. I have been concerned that my family would be worried about us. This morning I finally was successful in reactivating the service. It was a relief  to be able to contact Mark and let him know we were OK. I also contacted Susan to see how she was. Her boys are back on the trail unassisted and are headed to the same camping spot tonight as we are.
Cole stayed with me for most of the day. By choice! We had a few interesting discussions and the day passed quickly. 
We stopped at Stratton Pond Shelter for lunch. To stay at this shelter overnight you need to pay five dollars. It is a nice shelter but unless it was raining I don’t think I would pay to stay there.
A few hours later we stopped at Spruce Peak shelter for dinner then finished off our day 3 miles down the trail at a nice camping spot beside a stream. A road is also in close proximity and the traffic is a bit noisy, but you can’t always have it all. Tom and Gene arrived at the same camping spot not much later, Nick was behind.

We hiked up Bromley Mountain and were rewarded with a fantastic view.
I spotted a bear on the trail a short distance ahead of me, but it was very skiddish and quickly ran off without even looking towards me once I hollered “Hey Bear!”
By the time we stopped to eat I was very discouraged and down. We rested for at least an hour, chatting with sobos, nobos and LT hikers. Paul was there ( the TL hiker we have encountered a few times) and another LT hiker named Stef. Tom, Gene and Nick arrived too. There are always people about on this section of the trail. 
I was in better spirits as I headed out after our break. We only had six miles left and it felt doable. Cole hung back and hiked with Nick for a while. There was a steep rock climb up Baker Peak. Two majestic views in one day! Aside from that, there were a lot of long flat stretches and even considerable lengths of boardwalk. Snakes slithered out from under many of the boards as I crossed them and I took pictures to send to Evan.
The miles passed and my boot tightened more and more as my foot swelled inside. Originally we were going to stop at Big Branch Shelter. However, Guthooks said that there were few tenting spaces there so we stopped short just across the stream at a campsite. The guys were there too. The first thing I did was take off my boots and soak my feet in the icy water. In the evening we all sat around in a circle chatting, eating and swapping drink mixes.

There is a deli just under a mile off the trail that we can reach at the end of the day if I can get there on time. We need to Resupply and I was hoping that by stopping at the deli we would be able to stretch our food until tomorrow. Cole likes hanging out with Gene and Nick and it would be nice to get one more day with them before we take a zero to rest and resupply. However when I pulled the food bags down from the tree, I saw a familiar looking hole in one of them. Sure enough,  a mouse had chewed a hole in Cole’s food bag. His odour blocking bag had not been sealed. The mouse chewed a hole in that anyway too. At first I thought it had only gotten into the garbage, but Cole got up and looked more closely and discovered his bagels had become mouse food. Shoot! I guess that we need to Resupply today. 
Cole and I have sometimes been heading out together, but today I left him behind to pack up. He caught up once, then stopped to filter water. The second time he caught up he went flying past me with Nick.
When I caught up to him he was sitting alone, but wanted to go to the next shelter for lunch. It was off the trail and I didn’t want to go. My foot was hurting and I wanted to get to a stream to soak it. He tried everything to get me to go...”Wouldn’t you rather eat sitting at a picnic table instead of on a log?”
“Actually I am just as happy sitting on a rock.”
“There will be water.”
“Maybe. Is Nick going to be there?”
“Ya.”
“Well that is the real reason you want to go.”
“I have to use the privy.”
That is fine, you go use the privy. I am gong to continue on.”
I made my way along the trail down into a ravine and found a nice rock in the middle of a stream to sit on and soak my feet. I pulled out the remains of our food which consisted of a rehydrated bean salad which I’d had soaking all morning, two packages of spam, a slice of cheese and a couple of slices of bread. I ate half of everything, leaving the other half for Cole. It wasn’t too long before he arrived and devoured his half. We were both still hungry. 
It began to rain not long after we started moving again.
I had to keep telling myself, “just keep going Sheila, just keep going.”
At long last we reached the road and turned west to head for the deli. In the distance we could see two hikers headed our way on the opposite side of the road. When they caught sight of us they quickly crossed the street. It was the two Long Trail hikers, Paul and Steph.
“We bought subs for you guys!” Paul exclaimed. 
I’m not sure if he ever said why. Perhaps he thought we wouldn’t make it in time. What he did add was that he was so impressed with us for having made it as far as we have. I told him about our mouse problem last night and that we still needed to get somewhere to resupply.
Before we had much time to talk more, a vehicle slowed down on the other side of the road and the gentleman inside hollered words of support. We do get that from time to time. People who see us and know what we are doing and where we are headed will offer words of encouragement.
Paul hollered back across the road.
“Would you be able to drive these two to the deli down the road?”
“Sure!” The driver called back.
I hugged both of them and said a hasty goodbye before Cole and I hustled across the street to our ride.
“Actually,” I said, “Would you be able to drive us all of the way to town?”
Our impromptu trail angel agreed. He just had an errand to run on the way.
It turned out that Michael, our trail angel, has a son who is a triple crowner. We talked about the trail and he showed us gorgeous pictures of the CDT. He asked about our journey and our plans for in town. Then he made an offer. He wanted to pay for us to stay in a hotel room tonight.
I was floored. Michael was actually from out of town and was staying in Rutland for work. He got us a room at the same hotel he was staying at.  In the span of less than an hour, I went from hobbling along in the rain on an empty stomach wondering how we would get to town, to being showered, tucked under the warm blankets of a comfy bed in a hotel room, filling my stomach with the most delicious roast beef sub I had ever eaten. Cole was tucked in to his bed too. But we needed drinks. Who was going to budge and go to the vending machine? That was our next biggest concern. Isn’t it amazing how the kindness of a stranger can so suddenly turn your circumstances around, at least for a little while.","Big Branch

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600602,"It was me who eventually ventured out from under the covers last night to find the pop machine. Cole tried to bribe me to go. “I’ll scratch your back. I’ll rub your foot.” Finally I just went. The machine had a small hand written “out of order” sign taped to it. So,across the street I went to the gas station and brought back Mountain Dew, Coke, chocolate milk, donuts, cheesies and smart food. I guess that I was still hungry.
In the morning, our grumbly tummies woke us up early. The hotel had an all you can eat breakfast which included an array of both hot and cold food. I couldn’t tell you everything that Cole ate, but he sure did his best to clean them out.
Michael had offered to drive us to the hostel this morning. Our intent was to take a zero to resupply and rest. However, when we saw that the hostel was only just over a mile away and the hotel check out wasn’t until noon, we decided to take full advantage of the luxurious gift we had been given and enjoy the room for a bit longer. Cole crawled back into bed while I soaked my feet in the tub.
The time went by quickly and all too soon we had to move on.
The hostel was above a place called The Yellow Deli and is run by an organization called The Twelve Tribes Spiritual Community. I had read both good and bad things about the place and the people, but the only way to know for sure is to check it out for yourself.
When we arrived at the Yellow Deli we were greeted very warmly. We were given cold drinks and then taken on a tour of the hostel. What some people find odd is that women and men have to stay in different rooms whereas other hostels are unisex. This didn’t bother me. Privacy was nice. 
First on the agenda was laundry. The hostel provided clothes that you could borrow. The ladies cloths were a little old fashion. A sign above the clothes closet asked that you please wear these clothes if you are going to help out. There are many work opportunities in the hostel, the deli and on the farm that the community owns. 
I donned a shirt and a skirt that was about five sizes too big for me. It had strings so I was able to fix it around my waist so that it didn’t fall down. Cole didn’t want to put the clothes on, but I told him that it was the only way I could get all of his clothes clean. He selected a pair of shorts and a polo shirt. He didn’t look bad at all really, but made a point of telling me that I looked a lot younger in my hiking clothes. (But Cole....these ones are clean! What happened to clean clothes making me look young?”)
While we waited for the laundry to finish, a lady from the hostel asked for a volunteer to fold sheets. I took on the task. Afterwards we prepared to head to Walmart for our resupply. 
“Should I put my own clothes back on or just wear these?” I jokingly asked Cole. He was quite certain that I should put my own back on. Another through hiker sitting in the common room added, “You are going to stick out either way.” I agreed and decided to go in what I had on.
Walmart was all out of fuel for our cooking stove. We ended up having to take a bus to Dicks Sporting Goods in order to buy fuel. On the way back to the hostel we picked up a pizza from dominos. 
As we settled in to eat our pizza in the now packed common room of the Yellow Deli Hostel, I heard a familiar voice from the other side of the room say “There’s faces we know.” It was Tom. They had decided to get off the trail at VT4 to come into town. 
After eating and talking for a while, I headed to bed early, our “rest day” having not been full of running around and not very restful. ","VT 103 to Rutland

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600603,"This morning Cole told me that he had been sick last night after I had gone to bed. He had thrown up his pizza but was feeling fine now.
Yesterday I had been talking to a hiker named The Lady about slackpacking. There is a trail angel who could drive us back to the trailhead at VT103. Once we reached US4, 18 miles down the trail, there was a bus we could take right back to The Yellow Deli. It sounded like a good plan and an opportunity to spare my foot for one more day.
The free hiker breakfast at the yellow deli was at 7:30 but we went down a little early to help. We had toast, watermelon, an egg and meat dish and a rice dish. Both dishes had vegetables in them. Cole really liked the food and had seconds. We also had a tea called maté and those who helped with breakfast were given a smoothie. Both the rice dish and the smoothie tasted like they were flavoured with maté.
At breakfast there were “announcements”. People were thanked for their work and anyone who wanted to was invited to come to the farm to help out for the day. 
Gene  was interested in going to the farm so that is what the family is doing today. This means that once we are done slackpacking today, we will have caught up to them. Lady also decided to go to the farm so we would be slackpacking on our own.
Cole emptied his backpack and we put in it only the things we needed for the day, water and water filter, sandwiches, tp, etc. We found out that they had smaller bags at the hostel for us to use for slackpacking so we moved everything over into a smaller bag.
At 8:30 a trail angel picked us up and drove us back to where we had gotten off the trail at VT 103 The trail angel had day packs in his trunk that were a little bigger and had more comfortable straps than the one Cole was using, so we moved all of our things over again. He gave instructions on how to get the bus back to the hostel once we reached route 4, but also said that he would come and get us if we missed the last bus at 6:20.
I was positive we would miss it. In fact, I have been hiking so slowly with my sore foot that I was a little concerned about being finished before dark. We had headlamps just in case.
Then we were off. With the Advil, my foot was doing really well and so  I was able to move at a pretty good clip. It was a drizzly wet day. The forest always seems to be the happiest and the most beautiful on days like this and she smiled at me a lot. When I lifted my head long enough to catch a glimps of her grin, I snapped a quick photo. In the afternoon thunder rumbled and the rain came down a little heavier. We paused briefly for lunch at a shelter and Cole reached into his bag to pull out our sandwiches. They weren’t there. In the process of switching bags, they had been left behind. However he had brought an entire pack of lemon flavoured Oreo cookies, so that was our morning snack, our lunch and our afternoon snack as well. It is a good thing that I like lemon Oreos.
As we climbed mount killington we found a forest carpeted in moss. As long as it isn’t under my feet making me slip, I love the site of trees, rocks and roots laying beneath a moss blanket.  
With nothing on my back, the climb was not very difficult. We were making really good time. We took a short break in the shelter at the top of Killington. A southbounder was there. His birthday had passed recently and in celebration he had been giving out birthday cake Oreos, so Cole ate even more. Then we began our descent, still moving swiftly. We were not going to make the 6:20 bus.....we were going to make the 5:20 bus! I had to run on the flat straight aways, but we made it to the road with about five minutes to spare. 
“Cole, don’t expect me to move that fast ever again.” I told him as every inch of me began to complain the moment we sat down.
When we arrived at the hostel everyone was either heading out the door or getting ready to. On Friday evenings The Twelve Tribes celebrate the sabbath with singing, folk dancing and a meal. All of the hikers were invited to come. “Free Meal” That was the bait that hooked us all. Actually I was very interested in seeing their celebration as well. Today while we hiked, Cole and I had talked a lot about The Twelve Tribes and how their beliefs differ from ours. They seem to combine Christianity, Judaism, and “something else”. It is the things that fall under the category of “something else” that seem very strange to us. Initially, Cole didn’t think that we should attend the celebration. I thought it would be a good experience. Once we had talked about it for a while he felt better about going, and when he saw that all of the other hikers were going too, he was eager to go. Because, well......food!!!
We rushed to get showered and then put on hostel clothes. This time I found an outfit that fit me better. We were then driven not far away to a house that was used as a church. It was one big open space. The members of The Twelve Tribes were singing and folk dancing while hikers sat in an outer circle drinking moté, watching the dancing or shaking tambourines. Eventually tables were rolled, everyone was seated and we were served homemade bread, fish, rice and eggplant. There was desert too. I think it was pudding but I wasn’t sure. 
When the meal was done, everyone helped to clear away the dishes and move the tables. Then one of the community members led the hikers in a folk dancing lesson. Cole was not at all interested in the dancing lesson. I tried for a couple of rounds but then had to get off my foot. Some of the hikers looked like they were having a really good time. I was anxious to get to bed. 
Eventually the celebrations came to an end and we loaded up onto a small bus with the other hikers to return to the hostel.","VT 103

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600604,"We headed down to the kitchen early again today to help out with breakfast. For our efforts we received a delicious piece of homemade chocolate cake. For breakfast we had granola with fruit and boiled eggs. I ate at least four eggs. Maybe five. Oh, and I drank at least two mugs of moté. In this place there is always moté.
The bus back to the trailhead departed every hour at quarter after. I had asked Cole to be ready early because we needed to go to the bank first. It was almost 8 o’clock and he still wasn’t ready. 
He probably liked being in a  “guys only room” where I couldn’t go in, but I had a pretty big group of male hikers hanging around that I could send in one at a time to pester him.
“Cole, your mom is waiting on you.”
“Cole, your mom says hurry up!”
“Cole, your mom says you have to leave now!”
We had to rush to the bank across the street on the way to the bus stop. The bank machine spit out  50’s. Shoot! I had no time to go in and get smaller bills.
We made it to the bus. Tom and Gene were already on board. Nick came running at the last minute and we were all on our way. 
Our bags were heavy with food and there was a lot of climbing . More climbing than I think we have done in a long time.  
I thought that Tom and the boys were ahead of us, but they had had to stop to pick up a food package. Sometime in the afternoon Tom came hiking up behind us and for the remainder of the day he hiked behind me. Sometimes it is nice to have someone to chat to. The only thing is......I had four boiled eggs for breakfast. Or five!! Oh I was so gassy. I tried to let them out nice and slowly so they wouldn’t make a sound, but silent is usually deadly and I am afraid that some of them were. Poor Tom. But he stuck with me. If it had been Cole, I would have just let them all rip and he would have backed way off for the rest of the day.
The skies rumbled and it rained for a while. With our late start and my slow pace it was near dark when we reached The Lookout. There were already a lot of people sleeping on the floor. Cole had found room for us. Tom and the boys found spots on the second level. We cooked and ate our dinner. The other hikers had their food bags hanging inside, but by the time we were done it was pitch dark inside the cabin and everyone was sleeping. We weren’t going to be able to find a place to hang our bags to keep them from the mice. (The cabin had a door with a latch. No fear of bears.) 
“Just sleep with it beside you.” I told Cole. 
“That won’t keep the mice away.”
I think that he spent the night with one eye on his food bag. We could hear the mice scurrying about on the roof, but our food remained untouched through the night.","US 4
",The Lookout,"Aug 04, Sat",17.40
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600651,"I didn’t sleep very well last night. Whenever I am in a shelter or a hostel, or really any place on the trail except for my tent, I just don’t sleep as soundly. People were going in and out of the cabin throughout the night to go to pee in the bushes, and I of course was a participant in that parade. The floor was strewn with bodies and food bags were swinging from the ceiling. It was an obstacle course trying to tip toe out the squeaky door.
Before we left in the morning, I climbed to the top of the lookout, which is on the roof of the building, and took pictures of the clouded but still lovely view.
Along our route today we would be passing by a farm that sold baked goods and other delights that tempt hungry thru hikers.  Despite our food laden packs, I promised Cole a treat. It was only a short distance off the trail but when we reached the turn and I saw a bubbling cold stream and a comfy bench I decided that I would rather sit and rest than do the extra distance. I gave Cole some money and explicitly told him to buy a snack, not a meal. I also asked him to get me a drink, and if he found any treat that he thought I might like he could grab that too.
While he was gone I laid on the bench for a while, but it was short and uncomfortable. I laid all my wet sox out on the concrete in the sun to dry then I waded into the stream. Cole returned.
“What did you get?”
“A pint of ice cream. It was the best deal! And I got you one too!”
With a big smile on his face he produced a pint of vanilla ice cream a spoon and a coke. A pint of ice cream!! That might be a snack to him, but to me it was a meal. I smiled though and said nothing.
“Oh, I forgot to get water there.”
“You can filter it from the stream.”
“I’d rather walk back.”
Off he went back to the farm leaving me standing in the middle of the stream barefoot with a coke in one hand and a pint of vanilla ice cream in the other.
I managed to eat the pint, though not before some of it had melted. While drying off my feet, another backpacker returned from the farm.
“Was the ice cream good?” She asked. “Your Son was stressing over what to get you and we all voted on the ice cream.”
I was so glad that I hadn’t said anything to him. 
Neither of us ate lunch.
It seemed like it took forever to get to Thistle Hill Shelter. I stopped for a while with a hiker named Holiday to watch an owl in a tree. It’s eyes were big and wide as it stared back at us from its perch and we wondered why it was awake during the day.
I was so tired when I arrived at the shelter that I crawled right into the tent to sleep. Cole had arrived before me and had set it up without the fly. He was hanging  out at the shelter with Nick, Gene and a couple of other hikers. He made himself peanut butter and jam sandwiches and then took our food bags to hang them in a tree. Suddenly I heard him hollering in pain. I bolted upright and through the mesh of the tent saw Nick running from the shelter to where Cole had been hanging the food.  Shortly after he reached Cole, Nick turned towards our tent and shouted “He’s ok!”
Cole had been trying to hang the food bags on a dead tree branch. As he pulled the bags up, the branch had broken. The limb had struck him on the shoulder as it and the food bags had come crashing to the ground. 
Once I knew he was alright, I put in my ear plugs, covered my eyes with my buff and almost immediately fell asleep.","The Lookout
",Thistle Hill Shelter,"Aug 05, Sun",14.80
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600658,"First thing in the morning I made my daily trek to the privy. Privies come in all different shapes and sizes on the AT. At this shelter the privy is six sided and screened in above waist level like a porch. It lets you poo with a view, but allows passers by to watch you too! “Privy” is derived from a French word meaning “private”. Why they choose to use that term on the AT I have no idea. Digging a cat hole was often a more private affair than using the privy.
On the trail we went through three towns today. The first was West Hartford. As we hiked along the road, a woman passed by in a car and shouted out the window that there was soda on her porch for us. There was watermelon and baked goods too. 
It was a hot day and although I don’t mind road walking from time to time, without the trees to shelter us from the sun, the heat was intense. When we turned and walked below an underpass, Holiday, who was hiking near us, put her hand on the concrete wall. 
“It’s so nice and cold !” She exclaimed. Soon all three of us were pressed up against the concrete wall trying to absorb the coolness.
Once we started walking again, we were quickly back under the trees, but a few miles later we were road walking again. White blazes led us through Norwich and then we crossed over the Connecticut River leaving Vermont and all of its mud behind. Our destination was The Green in Hanover. We found it easily and plopped our packs and our butts down on a bench and took off our boots. An alluring aroma filled my nostrils. Hotdogs! There must be a hotdog stand somewhere! I jumped up with as much enthusiasm as a tired hungry hiker can muster. Where was it? I looked up and down the street. To the embarrassment of my son, I also asked passers by if they had seen a dog stand. Nobody had. Finally I put on my crocs and went hunting for it. I returned empty handed. 
I sat back down on the bench beside Cole, pulled off my crocs and began a foot inspection....also to the embarrassment of my son. I found three toe nails just barely attached to my toes. One by one with a quick pull and a small wince I removed the nails. Cole was fairly grossed out.
Sleepy and hungry I closed my eyes and leaned sideways up against my pack. 
“Are you sure that they will see us?” Cole asked.
“Hon, we stick out like sore thumbs.”
Then I think that I dozed off because my cheek felt a bit moist from drool when I heard a voice that I had not heard in thirty years say “Should I bring the car around?”","Thistle Hill Shelter
",Hanover NH,"Aug 06, Mon",14.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600685,"In 1988, when I was seventeen years old, I spent a summer overseas on a missions trip. We didn’t have email or Facebook back then to keep in touch with friends, but many years later, with the invention of the internet, I was able to find some of my former team mates. Mary Ruth was one of those long lost teammates.
In March, when I announced to my family and friends on Facebook that  we would be hiking The Appalachian Trail, Mary Ruth said that she and her husband would love to help us out once we got to New Hampshire. 
New Hampshire. Would we even make it there? That was almost 1750 miles of hiking we would have to do before we reached her. Could we do that?
Apparently we could, and we did, and now here we were waking up in Mary Ruth’s home in Piermont  New Hampshire. 
For four days and five nights Mary Ruth and her husband Richard completely spoiled us. They made us breakfast, drove us to the trail each day, picked us up (sometimes with treats in hand!) and fed us dinner. Their two daughters gave up their beds for us. Richard, a triathlete, had recovery boots that massage your legs to push the blood back up. He let me use them every day. Each night our boots went on his boot dryer over night so we started each day with dry feet. We used their washing machine, their shower and even their soap and shampoo...because thru hikers don’t generally carry those things. We stunk up the house, we stunk up the car and somehow we even managed to stink up the Jeep even though the doors and roof were off. We saw and experienced more of New Hampshire than we would have seen on the trail alone. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed recalling memories of our 1988 summer trip with Mary Ruth, as well as catching up with the present.
At the end of it all we were sent off with full food bags and enough support and encouragement to fuel us to the end of this journey.
I did not write in my journal during our time with Mary Ruth and Richard. Since I am so far behind, I will briefly write in this one post what I remember from our four days of pampering. 
Tues Aug 7th
Hanover to Dorchester Rd. 17.5 miles 
Richard cooked pancakes for us in the morning and then drove us in his Jeep back to Hanover. I’d never been in a Jeep before with the doors off. Mark would be jealous. (He had a Jeep in his pre-married life and would love to have one again.)
The terrain was much like we had been experiencing for the past few days. There were some climbs, but nothing that I would describe as difficult. It was a wet drizzly day. We had one good view from Holts Ledge.
Richard picked us up at the end of the day and we stopped by a variety store for snacks to tide us over until dinner. I grabbed a very large container of chocolate milk, two pops and a cinnamon bun (not knowing Richard was intent on paying). The chocolate milk was from a local dairy and it was absolutely delightfully delicious. I think that Richard was surprised when I downed the entire container. We stopped in at a local self serve farm store to purchase bacon and eggs.
We met up with Mary Ruth, her mom and her daughters and we went out for pizza for dinner.
Mark had mailed a box to me with a new pair of boots as well as some of our warm gear. It arrived today.
Wed Aug 8th
Dorchester Road to Cape Moonshine Rd. 17.9 miles
For breakfast Richard made us bacon and egg breakfast sandwiches. Yum!
With new boots on we climbed two mountains with nice views, Mt Smarts and Mt Cube. I started off going very slowly and when we reached the fire tower on top of Smarts, we were so far behind where we thought we should be that Cole wouldn’t even climb the tower. We were out of water and the source by the Fire Wardens Cabin was difficult to collect from, delaying us further. We picked up speed in the afternoon though.  
Some parts of the trail were incredibly muddy. At one point I came to a big “puddle” of water with a log across it. No problem. I would walk on the log. I didn’t test it with my poles first. I stepped and the log sank. It had been floating on top of the water. My poles couldn’t find solid ground to save me and for a millisecond I thought I was going for a swim. I stopped sinking at my knee. For the rest of the day I sloshed along with a wet foot. My new boots had been christened and I was extremely grateful knowing there was a boot dryer waiting for me at Mary Ruth’s house.
Cole made it to the meet up point near the time Richard arrived, but I was a ways back. 
Mary Ruth had hamburgers and corn on the cob waiting for us when we returned. Cole and I both went to bed early.
Thurs Aug 9th
Moonshine Rd to Kinsman Notch
17.3 miles
Mary Ruth drove us to the trail head. The drives are not short little jaunts, but thirty to fourty-five minute rides along country roads. That is a lot of time....and gasoline used to help us!
When we arrived at the trail we discovered that we had forgotten our trekking poles at the house! Of all the days to forget poles, this was the wrong one! We had a long steep climb up to the top of Mount Moosilauke. On our way up I asked ever south bounder we saw if they’d had a good view at the top. 50% said yes and 50% said no. We got lucky. The sky was bright and clear as we ascended above the tree line. It was windy and cold though and while I wanted to hang around and take dozens of photos, Cole wanted to move on quickly. 
On our way down, there was a very steep, wet rocky treacherous section of trail that we had been warned about in Guthooks. I was descending very slowly down it.
Richard arrived at our meeting point and started up the trail to find us, then he descended with us. At the bottom, someone had enclosed an area of the creek with rocks and had filled it with cans of soda.
 Richard had chocolate milk, Mountain Dew and whoopie pie waiting at the Jeep for us.
For dinner, Mary Ruth made delicious tacos with beef, beans, rice and guacamole. Delicious!
Fri Aug 10th
Kinsman Notch to Franconia Notch
16.3 miles
Mary Ruth brought us back to the trail in the morning. The first thing Cole did was backtrack to the creek to see if there was still trail magic in the water. There was.
Up up up we begin to climb. I describe a lot of terrain as steep and rocky, but the meaning varies a lot. We were now in The Whites, the most difficult 100 mile stretch of the Appalachian Trail. Here, steep and rocky means using your hands and feet to climb. It means flat vertical rock faces that you need to climb up with the help of small cracks for footholds and conveniently grown trees to assist. Many of these trees have been bent over and partially uprooted from repeatedly lending a hand....or branch.
We had more beautiful views on south Kinsman and another slow slow descent. The day was getting long, the time late and my feet tired. Cole’s belly was rumbling so when we came across our first Hut, we stopped briefly to purchase a piece of lemon cake each. The huts in the White Mountains are places you can pay (a hefty price) to stay overnight and get fed dinner and breakfast. They make a baked good each day and soup that they sell for $2. They also have an assortment of supplies and snacks for purchase.
Three miles from Franconia Notch the terrain levelled out. By now it was late in the day and I could not find on Guthooks the parking lot where Richard and Mary Ruth were going to pick us up. I also had no signal on my phone and my battery was low.
We reached the notch. Still no signal. The sun was quickly setting and the one headlamp we had brought had low batteries. There was a visitor centre close by, but it would surely be closed. There were two parking lots, but neither matched the name that Richard had given me from his map. Now what?
We decided to head for the visitor centre, praying that perhaps an employee would still be there. 
A short way down the trail I could see a figure heading towards us. In the twilight I couldn’t make out a face, but the glow of a cel phone was partially illuminating him. A cel phone! Hopefully with a signal!!
“Hello!” I called out.
He lifted his head and spoke. It was Richard! Horray!!!
Back in the car Richard pulled out a shopping bag full of dehydrated backpacking food. They had already done so much for us...too much really, but he wouldn’t let me pay him for the food. We stopped at a grocery store to pick up a few more items and then Mary Ruth, Richard and the girls, Cole and I all went out for dinner.
It was a late night. Mary Ruth drove while the rest of us closed our eyes as the car meandered through the dark along the winding country roads towards home.","Hanover NH
",Franconia Notch,"Aug 10, Fri",69
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600702,"As much as I wanted to get a bit more sleep, I still couldn’t get my internal alarm shut off and was up early. I started sorting through my things and packing my bag. Then I packed Cole’s bag. I was excited and ready to get back out on the trail on our own, but also sad to be leaving. We have truly been spoiled for the past few days and it has been very nice to sleep in a bed, eat good food and have friends to talk to.
After breakfast, showers, a bit of a drive and some goodbyes, we were off.
My backpack felt very heavy at first, but my body soon remembered how to carry it and the pack began to feel lighter. It was another steep rocky treacherous climb. As we climbed we felt like we had covered a good distance, but a mileage check on Guthooks told us differently. We were going so slowly.
We passed a campsite and shortly afterwards Cole decided that he wanted to backtrack to it in order to use the privy. I found a good sitting rock and waited. When he returned, a strong odour filled my nostrils.
“Um, Cole. I smelled poo when you walked by me just now.”
“Well, I smelled it when I walked by you.”
“You are the one who just came from the privy.”
“Well I don’t have any poo on me.”
I sniffed closer to him. He sniffed closer to me. I checked where I had been sitting and where I had put my bag down. We checked the bottoms of our boots. We looked around in the bushes near us. We smelled each other’s bags. We smelled each other’s hands. Hikers have a strong pungent aroma, but it doesn’t smell like poo.....and we didn’t. By the time we were done smelling each other we were almost rolling on the rocks with laughter. We never did find the source of the mysterious poo smell, but I did discover that it is incredibly difficult to laugh and climb rocks at the same time.
When we reached the top of Little Haystack we were above the tree line and the view was a great reward for our efforts. After that we walked along Franconia ridge climbing one mountain after another. The views were absolutely stunning. I took photos and videos knowing that nothing I captured would ever come close to the real thing.
The ridge was very crowded with day hikers. A few of them recognized us as thru hikers and congratulated us. A group of three sobos cheered and greeted us with “hey nobos!” They asked Cole his age (he gets asked that almost daily) and gave him props and lots of positive words of support and congratulations. It all seems a bit premature. Every day feels like a struggle when my foot starts to hurt and sometimes Katahdin seems like it is moving further and further away.
We were up on the ridge for a long time. Long enough that both of us needed to pee. Everything was exposed and you could see a long way in any direction you turned. As we continued along the ridge, the crowd of hikers thinned considerably. Most would turn around and go back to their vehicles in the direction they had come, while we continued to press on northward. Eventually we were alone. Cole easily found a rock to hide behind to take care of business. Guys only have one side they need to shelter from sight.
Whenever you enter the alpine zone above tree line , there are signs asking you to stay on the trail to protect the sensitive alpine vegetation. That meant I would have to do my business on the trail. There were rocks to hide behind, but that would just hide me from view on one side.  Where do you pee up on the ridge? Where? Surely I was not the first person to be caught in this predicament. 
When I was young we used to say that our eyes were turning yellow when we had to pee badly. My eyes must have been swimming in it. I remembered a thru hiker at a hostel bragging that three times he had walked up on women peeing on the trail. I didn’t want to be the one someone told stories about. I’ll tell my own stories, thank you very much.
We came to a steep descending section of trail. There was a large boulder just at the pinnacle . If Cole stood in just the right spot he could be a lookout and block the view of anyone coming up, while the boulder would block the view of anyone coming down. This wasn’t a job that he was thrilled about, but he graciously complied.
Ah....relief! 
I was ready to be done for the day. It had been a long long day. Stealth camping was out of the question though so we had to get to Garfield Ridge Campsite/Shelter. There was a caretaker there and they charged a $10 fee per person. The campsite was packed, but there were very few thru hikers. 
We set up our tent on a wooden platform then cooked dinner at the cooking area and headed to bed.","Franconia Notch
",Garfield Ridge Shelter / Campsite ,"Aug 11, Sat",10.30
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600704,"It rained last night. I woke up only once and alhough it took me a while to fall back to sleep, I felt like I had a good rest by morning. 
The fly had been a bit droopy and the tent had not been pegged down on the deck. Cole had made an attempt to put the pegs between the deck slats and attach the tent that way, but it didn’t work well. Our neighbours’ tents looked just as wilty as ours in the morning but surprisingly not much water had found its way inside.
This shelter has a cooking area which was a bit of a trek from our tent platform. I trudged over there with our mountain house bacon and eggs (Thank you Richard!) and the water and stove. The stove wouldn’t light. It didn’t light last night either. I suppose the igniter is finally pooched. Back I went to the tent to get the matches. Cole was a long way from being ready. I handed him the matches and asked him to go and boil the water and I would pack up his things. Off he went. I began packing his bag. Five minutes later he returned. He couldn’t get the matches lit. Ugh! 
“Ok, you finish up here and I will go try.”
Back I went to the cooking area.
After ruining two matches, I finally got one lit. I guess that they have been sitting in my backpack for too long. A couple of more additional trips were made from cooking area to tent to cooking area to tent. I felt like I had hiked a mile by the time we finished our breakfast. 
“Slowly and carefully,” was the campsite caretaker’s advice as we headed past his tent and back out onto the AT. Immediately we came upon a steep rocky descent (aren’t they all!) right down the middle of a waterfall. Slowly and carefully. The whole day it was wet, slow and careful. Every potential view was shrouded in clouds.
Around  11am we stopped at Galehead hut. We have heard a lot of things about the huts. One thing we heard was that they will give breakfast leftovers to thru hikers. A couple of other thru hikers were there when we arrived. There was no breakfast, but there was a wee bit of lasagna from the night before. Cole was happy to polish that off. They had snacks and lemon cake as well as soup for sale. I bought us both a snickers, a piece of cake and a bowl of potato soup. It might be the last time we buy their soup. I really think it was just the water that they boiled potatoes in.....perhaps with the addition of a few spices. We had bagels in our food bag and we dipped them into the “soup”.
This morning we had discussed going either ten or fourteen miles depending on the terrain and how we were feeling. It was very clear when we headed back out to the trail that ten miles was going to be our limit. The terrain is very difficult and challenging. Instead of pushing for extra miles and having late days, I would rather do fewer miles and finish with enough time to relax and feel rested. Most of all I just want us to be alert and safe through this difficult section. The wet rocky climbs and decents are just so tiring too.
 I wanted to be finished early. We had our sights set on finishing at Zealand Falls Hut and doing a work for stay. Let me explain. Each hut will take in a few thru hikers each day to get help cleaning up after the evening meal. In exchange, the hikers are fed dinner (after the guests have finished) and they get to spend the night on the floor of the dining room. This is another one of those things we have heard many different stories about. One source said that they only take a couple of people, while another said they will take everyone who shows up. Another person told us that the time to show up for work for stay was between 4 and 7. We had no idea if they would take us (Cole being a minor), or if we would arrive at the right time. Maybe they would have enough people and we would get sent on. It was a gamble.
About two miles from the hut, we were sitting on a rock to rest when a French Canadian hiker came by. We struck up a conversation and she asked us questions about our hike. She told us that there were already a few thru hikers milling around at the hut. That didn’t make our chances took good.
Before she continued on, she reached into her bag and pulled out a bag of gummy candies and handed them to Cole. “They are made in Canada.” she said, knowing by then that we were from there too. He was delighted...of course!
We arrived at the hut just before 5pm. I went inside and asked about work for stay. “We need two people,” the woman told me.
“There are two of us.” I said.
She glanced at Cole, but said nothing about his age. Our instructions were to hang out until dinner was over. We would then be called in and we could eat and do about an hour of work. After that we would sleep on the floor. Perfect! 
While we were hanging out waiting on the porch of the hut, I ventured over to where the restrooms were. There were two doors and both said  “restroom”  but neither one indicated which gender they were for. I slowly pushed open the door on the left. On the counter by the sink there were a few feminine products . Bingo! I picked the correct door.
As I was sitting there doing my business, I heard someone else enter the restroom and go into the stall beside me. The person began to pee and I could tell from the sound that it was not being done from a seated position. I bent forward a bit and peered under the wall. Sure enough, there were two great big harry feet facing in the wrong direction. I was in the wrong restroom!!! Or....was he? I didn’t know, but I sure wasn’t coming out of that stall until he was gone. So, I sat there. He finished up and washed his hands (good job!), then exited. I darted out of there as fast as I could, (without washing my hands-bad girl!) not wanting any other guy to come in before I left. (Thank goodness for the hand sanitizer I keep on my pack).
After the guests ate, we were called in to eat. It felt really odd. There was not much of the main course left, certainly nothing like the stories we had heard about oodles and oodles of food. However there was a lot of cake left and Cole was happy to eat three pieces.
We waited a long while to be given our chores. Again, they were nothing like what we had heard. We had to: Clear off and a wipe down all of the shelves in the kitchen, organize the spice shelf alphabetically, remove and clean the cast iron burners on the stove (they were still cooking food and some were very hot. We were told to just use a pot holder to pick them up and run cold water over them in the sink to cool then) clean the grease tray on the stove, and finally pull out all of the crumb catchers on the stove and replace the tin foil in them. When we were done, the dining area, where we were to sleep, was still full of people playing cards. We were told that lights out was at 9:30 and we could set up our beds then. 9:30 came and someone announced that it was time for lights out. But, she added, you can stay up and continue to play cards if you have a headlamp and keep your voice low.
What? 
Half a dozen people stayed behind to play cards. Cole and I pulled one of the tables and benches out from the wall so that we could set our bedding up behind it to have some privacy. We crawled under our quilts still dressed in our clothes and put earplugs in our ears. I could still hear the not so low voices of the people playing cards as I tried to fall asleep.","Garfield Ridge Shelter / Campsite 
",Zealand Falls Hut,"Aug 12, Sun",9.60
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600707,"The kitchen staff members were busy banging things around at 5am and I could hear them clearly despite the ear plugs. Guests were already coming in and out of the dining room. I got up and began packing up my bag. It felt really awkward. Nobody said a word to me. A bit before 6am  I got Cole moving and we relocated to a bench outside of the hut to eat our breakfast. We were happy to get back on the trail and away from the hut. 
The next seven miles was fairly easy. Someone had called it the easiest stretch in the whites. Once we got down to Crawford Notch and then began climbing again, it was back to steep, rocky and slow. It began to rain. We had numerous climbs up vertical slabs of rock. The poor trees growing along the sides had obviously been repeatedly  used for leverage. Some of the smaller ones were nearly uprooted and you couldn’t always trust that the trees would hold you.  It was tiring, a bit scary and a little exciting all at the same time. There were no views except for clouds to reward us for our efforts.
We met a hiker named Late Start. Apparently she is slow to get going in the mornings, hence the name. She had begun her hike in Virginia intending to do a “flip flop”, but had since decided that she would be quitting after her “flip”. 
Coming down to Mizpah Spring Hut, Cole and I had already decided that we did not want to do another work for stay. Last night had been very awkward and we wanted to stay in our tent. We had intended to just stop in for snacks and then get a site at the campground next door. When we arrived at the hut, Late Start was already there talking to a staff member named Ian. They did not have anybody to do work for stay yet. Late Start said that she would prefer to stay in her hammock. Ian suggest a work for food arrangement as an alternative. He offered it to us as well. It sounded like a much better arrangement. 
The three of us headed over to the campsite to set up our tent / hammock. There was a $5 fee to stay there. Then we returned to the hut for our meal. Unlike last night, the food was plentiful. Ian had even popped the leftovers into the oven to warm them up a bit for us. There was enough for seconds and even thirds. Afterwards Cole and I washed dishes. Then, tired, happy and full we retired to our tent for the night.","Zealand Falls Hut
",Mizpah Spring Hut,"Aug 13, Mon",14.20
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600719,"It rained again last nigh,  but this time our tent did not fare so well on the wooden platform. Cole’s side of the tent was soaking wet.
 Our plan for the day was to hike only 5 miles to Lake of the Clouds Hut. Just  beyond Lake of the clouds was Mount Washington, but the weather forecast was calling for thunderstorms and we did not want to go over Mount Washington in a thunderstorm. Knowing that we had all day to go such a short distance, we were very very slow getting ourselves out of bed. Once we were packed up, we headed back to Mizpah hut to buy some snacks. On our last resupply I had only purchased a small fraction of the snacks that I usually get for Cole. Through this difficult section of trail I wanted both of us to carry as little as possible, and I knew there would be some food to buy in the huts. We also wanted to use our thru hiker card to get a free baked good.
The employee at the counter told us that there were cookies in the oven if we didn’t mind waiting, and that there was left over breakfast that we could help ourselves to. 
In the diningroom we found scrambled eggs and oatmeal with a sign that said “free”. There was also an enormous pile of pancakes with a sign that said “Pancakes: one dollar for all you can eat”. I paid the one dollar for Cole. First he had oatmeal and eggs and then he somehow managed to devour 17 pancakes. I’d say I got my dollar’s worth.
When the cookies had finished baking, they were brought out to the table on a plate. A tray of burned cookies was brought out too. We were instructed to take our free cookie from the plate and then given permission to eat as many of the burnt cookies from the tray as we liked. By then Cole’s belly was already bursting at the seams. I had only eaten eggs and oatmeal, so I had lots of room for burnt cookies.
We began climbing Mount Pierce with very full stomachs! The views were clouded, but from time to time the clouds would part and reveal what was behind them. Cole said that he liked it much better when the clouds parted to show him a view rather than having a perfectly clear day. I am not sure that I agree with that, but it was pretty awesome to see what was behind the clouds as they opened up. It was like unwrapping a gift to see what was inside. Sometimes we just sat and watched and waited to see if anything would be revealed. It was an enjoyable hike. 
We passed numerous backpackers on their journey from Lake of the clouds to Mizbah hut. Cole came up with a name for them. Since people who camp in an RV are “glamping” he decided to call people who backpack by going from hut to hut glackpackers.... glamorous backpackers. 
By the time we arrived at Lake of the Clouds, the sun was holding its own and the view from the hut was outstanding. The climb up to Mount Washington looked clear and dry, but it was already past 3pm. I went inside the hut to find out what our options were.
They would not take us to work for stay because it was too early in the day. The only way we could stay was to pay to sleep in a dungeon like bunk room below the hut. 
If we decided to climb the mountain, where could we stay? The staff member pointed on the map to the next hut where we might be able to do wfs. It was seven miles away and I was fairly certain that at the speed I had been going, I would not make it.
Then the staff member gave me information that I probably should have known not to rely on. She said that there were a lot of trails off the AT that went down below tree line and that we could pick one and find or make our own stealth site. 
“What is the nearest trail we could take to do that?” I asked.
She pointed to a trail called Sphinx which was 1.4 miles from the top of Washington. That sounded doable.
“Is lightening still in the forecast?”
“Not lightening, just thunder.”
That statement alone should have told me to consult someone else.
“Isn’t there always lightening with thunder?” Cole asked me later. Even he knew better.
The signs hanging around the hut even warned, if you can hear thunder, then you are within striking distance. I guess she didn’t read them.
Her final word of misinformation ... after Mount Washington the trail isn’t difficult. It is mostly flat.
I made the decision to take advantage of the nice weather and climb Mount Washington. In retrospect, despite the way this day finally ended, I don’t think that I would change this decision. We had clear skies and beautiful views for the entire climb...and I was happy!  As we reached the summit, the clouds moved in. We found the Mount Washington sign and took a few pictures, then moved on to the visitor centre for overpriced hotdogs. 
I was feeling a bit uncertain at this point about where we were headed,  and so I inquired at the visitor centre if there was a place to stay on top of the mountain. Someone on Guthooks had indicated that they would let you stealth camp near or below the train tracks. That sounded odd, but it wouldn’t hurt to ask. I was told that there was no place to stay on the summit and that it was illegal to camp above treeline. I was also told that camping on the east side of the mountain was currently prohibited.
Huh?
He listed off the names of a half dozen or more trails along which you could not camp. I was sure that Sphinx ran down the east side of the mountain but I did not hear it in the list.
I had a strong feeling that our plan to stealth camp  was not going to pan out. I tried to rush Cole with his hotdogs so that we could get moving off the mountain as quickly as possible. We filled up all of our water bottles not knowing how far we would get or if there would be a water source.
Heading down off the peak of Mount Washington we were greeted with more clear skies and stellar views. It was easy to see a long way off into the distance. It was easy to see that tree line would not be easily reachable.
We hiked a mile, than a mile and a half, than 2 miles and still we did not come across a trail named sphinx. It was time for a new plan.
There were two options. The first was a shelter that was still a few miles ahead and  1 mile off the AT. The shelter had an overnight fee of $15 per person. The second option was to try for Madison Spring hut. The hut was only about half a mile further distance than the shelter. We would not have to leave the AT to reach it, but there was no guarantee that they would take us in.
Cole did not want to waste hiking a mile off the AT and he wanted to try for the hut instead. I did not want to waste the mile either, however the shelter was a shorter distance and a sure thing. There was a possibility that we could get turned away from the hut. We would be unable to reach either destination before sunset and we only had one working headlamp, so the shorter route was preferable.
I made the final decision to head for the shelter.
Once we turned off the AT my heart seemed to pound a bit faster and a knot hardened in my stomach, but I said nothing to Cole. The sun was setting fast. 
“We are going to be ok bud. We’ve got a headlamp and we can use the flashlight on my phone if necessary. We will just go really slowly and get there when we get there.”
The trail down to the shelter was not nearly as well travelled as the AT,  and in places it was hard to follow. There were also a number of rock scrambles and I was hoping beyond hope that we would not have to do that once it got dark.
In the twilight we were still able to see the trail until we finally dropped down below tree line. Then it  became too dark and we needed to pull out our one working headlamp. I had purchased new batteries for the other headlamp and had asked Cole to change them. Unfortunately he mistakenly took the good batteries out of the working headlamp and replaced them with the new batteries. Mistakes happen. At least we still had a light. 
At first I walked with the headlamp on out in front of Cole, but he said he could not see very well, so I passed the lamp back to him. He put it on his head over top of his ball cap. The brim blocked part of the light but instead of just removing the hat, he wanted to argue that the hat wasn’t interfering with the light. We were standing in pitch dark, not far below treeline on a mountain with some of the most dangerous weather in the world and he wanted to argue about whether or not his hat was obstructing the light from the headlamp. I took the headlamp back. 
Two minutes later he was apologizing, removing his hat and asking for the light again. I passed it to him. From behind me all the light did was cast my own shadow directly in front of me. 
“Mom, you have to stay to one side of the trail so I can shine the light in front of you.”
“Have you seen this trail? That is nearly impossible! I have to step where it is the safest for me to step.”
He sighed or grunted or made a “tuh” sound with his tongue whenever I didn’t stick to one side of the trail.
I took the headlamp back.
We moved forward very slowly. Every little opening or water run off seemed like a trail. Finally we found a sign pointing towards the shelter and we turned. Soon we were confronted with a rocky incline blocking our way. Should we climb over it? Did the trail go that way or did we miss a turn. We had to be so close now. Maybe someone would hear us.
“Hello! Hello!” I called out into the dark. “Is there anybody there?” Nobody answered, but way off in the distance I was certain that I saw a quick flash of light. We stood still for a bit and gazed into the darkness. There it was again. 
We climbed over the rock and headed towards the light. Soon we came upon two backpackers wearing headlamps hanging out on an empty tent platform. A second platform was next to them with a tent and other gear.
They offered to clear the platform for us but instead we asked for directions to the shelter. It was almost right next door, just hidden by the night.
We sprawled out in the empty shelter, but then cleared one side in case any other latecomers arrived. Cole hung the food bags and we crawled into our beds. I had a phone signal so I sent Mark a message to tell him that we had successfully passed another milestone. We had summited Mount Washington and we were safe and sound, one mile off the AT.","Mizpah Spring Hut
",The Perch ,"Aug 14, Tue",10.40
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600728,"I woke up a lot through the night and was tired and puffy eyed in the morning. The forecast was still calling for thunderstorms. 
Before we headed out I begrudgingly deposited $30 into the payment box at the shelter. How was this shelter worth $15 per person. There wasn’t even a bear box or a picnic table. The toilet in the privy wobbled unsteadily on its base and you had to hold the walls while sitting there so you didn’t fall off your perch. There weren’t even any hooks in the shelter to hang our backpacks on. Shouldn’t  I at least get a thru hiker discount like I do at other shelters in the Whites?
Then I scolded myself! Sheila, you would have gladly paid that money last night to get yourself and Cole off the ridge and somewhere safe once the sun went down. Now that the sun is up and you feel safe you don’t want to pay. Be grateful! Suck it up! Pay the fee!
So I did.
It was misty and cool as we backtracked the way we had come the night before. The trail looked totally different in the daylight. I felt a sense of relief and a bit more secure once our feet were back on the AT. Isn’t that strange.
We were up above the tree line walking on rocks all the way to Madison hut where we stopped in for a break. Tomorrow Mark would be meeting us at Pinkham Notch. We had a very short distance to go and two days to get there. We could take our time. The sky rumbled a few times but did nothing more. 
Mount Madison was a great pile of sharp jagged rocks. Slowly we climbed up and slowly we climbed down a number of peaks. 
At a low point between peaks where two trails merged we sat to cook lunch. In search of something from his pack, Cole exploded the contents of his bag all over the ground and left it there. In the mountains, sometimes the air is perfectly still and silent. Sometimes the wind blows and howls. In this instance it was a sudden strong gust that came whipping through our low place. It picked up Cole’s fleece where it was laying on the ground and flung it fifty feet up the face of the next rock pile. 
“Nooo” Cole cried, running after it. A south bounder who had just passed by us and was half way up the next peak, pointed and shouted trying to show Cole where the sweater had landed. When Cole reached the spot, the fleece was no longer there. He returned to quickly clean up the rest of his gear, then hurried back up the mountain of rocks . He hunted and hunted among the rocks, and finally, with a shout of delight, victoriously held it up for me to see.
Soon we got ourselves moving again and climbed the rocks that had hidden Cole’s fleece. Up above treeline, high in the mountains, sound carries easily across the rocks. We heard voices coming from behind us and off in the distance could make out a couple of hikers gaining on us. As they got closer and closer, I looked again. It was Tom and Gene. They had caught up to us. 
When they reached us we stopped to chat. Nick was behind and Tom and Gene were going to stop at Osgood tent site to wait for him. Since we had a lot of time to get to Pinkham Notch we decided to stop there as well. It was a short day. 4.5 miles on the AT and one mile off it. Still, we had taken most of the day to do it. Every step had hurt my foot.","The Perch

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600912,"With only five miles left to hike in order to meet up with Mark and Evan at 5:30, we took our sweet time to get moving on Thursday morning. Eventually it was our stomachs that inspired us to action. Tom and Gene had already headed out and were going to wait for Nick at Pinkham Notch. There is a deli there and that was our motivation to move. Still, we walked slowly and paused a lot to rest my foot. 
When we got to Pinkham Notch we ordered subs and soup and sat with Tom and Gene for a long time. Nick eventually showed up. Not long after that, Mark and Evan pulled up in the van. 
Tom and family headed to a hostel. Mark took us to a hotel to get cleaned up, and then we went to the Chinese buffet across the street.
On Friday we checked out of the hotel and relocated to White Birches Campground. Aside from a trip to Walmart, I spent the rest of the day, and the next, either sitting with my feet up or napping. The only place I walked to was the restroom. Mark cooked. Mark did the laundry. Mark rubbed my feet. How much more spoiled could I be?
Cole and Evan swam in the pool and played pool in the recreation room. They also stared at their electronic devices for a lengthy amount of time.","Osgood Tent Site
",Pinkham Notch,"Aug 18, Sat",4.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600921,"There are two places in Gorham where the AT meets the road. The first is at Pinkham Notch and the second is at Highway 2. The trail distance between the two is about 21 miles. This part of The Whites is a popular distance to slackpack. However it is an extremely difficult distance as well. It includes a lot of steep rock scrambling up and over The Wildcat Mountains and the Carter Mountain Ranges. Even at my best , I don’t think I could cover that distance in one day. Two days was definitely doable though. 
Cole and I decided to empty our bags of everything except for the very bare minimum we would need for one night on the trail. Then Mark dropped us off back at Pinkham Notch. Cole said that his bag felt as light as when we slackpack. Great! That was the goal. 
I was so grateful for the light pack as we began the rock scrambling. A couple of places were very tricky and it was hard to find the right groove or notch to stick a foot in or grab onto. We did it though! 
Cole said two things to me today that I need to put in writing so that I will remember them.  The first occurred while I was photographing some interesting mushrooms along side the trail. It went something like this:
C: Are you taking pictures of the mushrooms?
S: Yep! I don’t think we have these at home. I might never see mushrooms like this again.
C: Well I might. I don’t plan on sitting around at home for the rest of my life.
S: I’m glad! But I want you to promise me two things.
C: What? (Apprehensively)
S: No matter what adventurous activities you get up to in life, please promise me that you will take the time to LEARN how to do those activities safely and second, promise me that you will take the time to DO them safely.
C: I promise mom.
His reply came quickly and was heartfelt. Now I just wonder how many times in my lifetime I will have to remind him of that promise.
The second thing he said was at the end of the day. I don’t remember what prompted it, but it was surprising to me when he said it. He told me that I climb rocks better than he does. He did an awesome job today and all through the Whites. He’s stronger, faster and has more endurance than I do. At the end of a long day of hiking, he goes for a walk because he still has energy to burn. But, the next time he makes a comment about how slow “we” are going (meaning me), or the next time he is huffing because I need to take a rest, or sighing reluctantly because I want to stop for the day....I’ll just remind him that I climb rocks better than he does. lol He’ll probably never compliment me again.
Despite my supposed skills at rock climbing, it took us until sunset to reach Imp Shelter. There were no tent sites left, but we were ok staying in the shelter because we were anxious to get out early in the morning. There was only space on the second level. There was no ladder to access the second level, just a couple of notches in the middle supporting beam to use as footholds. I guess they figured that if we had come this far, we should be able climb to the second level of the shelter...and I am supposedly good at climbing. Humph! I would have preferred a ladder. ","Pinkham Notch
",Imp Shelter,"Aug 19, Sun",13.10
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601162,"When I woke up in the morning I was fairly certain that I had been snoring. My nose was plugged up and my mouth was dry. Cole immediately confirmed it. 
Sleeping on the second floor of a shelter wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t always have to get up in the middle of the night to pee. Before I went to bed last night, I practiced getting up and down from the second level. I couldn’t jump right down like the young spry kids who were up there do. I was fairly convinced that if I tried that, I would sprain my ankle.  On Friday, while going over the Wildcats, Nike sprained his ankle and had it to get off the trail. That was foremost in my mind as I contemplated the safest way to get down. I was beside a wall, so I stuck my right foot in a notch of the wall and hung onto a wooden sign that was attached to the wall. Then slowly I lowered my left foot to the ground. No jumping. 
My quilt is made from a very slippery material. When I woke up in the night, my toebox slipped over the edge of the platform pulling the rest of the quilt down with it. I reached quickly to grab the quilt and  was able to save it, but not my headlamp. Down it fell and landed with a plunk at the feet of the person below me. 
In the dark, I lowered myself to the ground. Thank goodness I had practiced.
We had some climbing to do up Mt Moriah. The sky was clear and the views were spectacular. We could see along the presidential range we had been traversing. Cole pointed out Mount Washington. We could barely make out what we thought was a road going up.  Hovering above the mountain was a cloud. While we had been waiting for our work for stay assignments at Mizpah Hut, Cole had listened in on a presentation about clouds. Standing there on Mount Moriah, he identified the cloud above Washington by name and described its characteristics, repeating what he had learned from the ranger. Smart Kid!
The rest or the trail down to US 2 was fairly easy. One more mile would bring us to a parking lot on a gravel road that Mark would still easily be able to access. I messaged him that we were going the extra mile. It was still early in the afternoon and we could have gone further, but not if we wanted more time with our family. 
Mark picked us up and we drove to the hostel in town. Nick is staying there until Susan picks him up on Thursday. (His dad and Gene had continued hiking after Nick got off.) We picked Nick up and we all went out for pizza. 
Back at the campsite I tried unsuccessfully to have a nap. Instead I sorted our gear and food to get ready to get back out on the trail.","Imp Shelter
",Hogan Rd,"Aug 20, Mon",8.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601164,"From Hogan Road, the next place that Mark is able to pick us up is Grafton Notch. That is a distance of a proximately 30 miles and includes the hardest miles on the trail, Mahoosuc Notch. We need to do that distance in two days if we wanted to spend more time with Mark and Evan.
My alarm went off at 5 AM this morning so that I could get us packed and ready as soon as possible. Mark had us back at the trail by 6:30. The skies were bright and clear, but I knew that rain was in the forecast tomorrow. I wanted to take a big chunk out of that 30 miles today.
We hiked, not quickly, but steadily and with few stops. The terrain was certainly easier than in The Whites and we made fairly good time...for us.
We reached the New Hampshire/Main border and snapped some celebratory photos, then pressed on.
By sunset we still had two miles to go to get to Full Goose Shelter. When it got too dark to see, we pulled out our headlamps ( with new batteries). We were above treeline for what seemed like an eternity. Our headlamps could not penetrate the mist, and we could not see very far in front of our feet. We couldn’t see the cairns that we were supposed to be following either. I pulled out my Guthooks app and we used it to keep us pointed in the right direction, feeling relief whenever we spotted a cairn or a short boardwalk that told us we were still on the right track.
Eventually we were back down into the trees where the trail was easier to follow, but not flat. There were rock inclines and even a few ladders. 
At 9:15 we finally arrived at the shelter. It was perfectly silent, but packed with bodies lined in a perfect row. We looked around for a tent spot and found space on a platform. As quietly as we could we set up the tent. I took our food bags over to the bear box, but it was already packed so full of food bags that I could barely get it closed again once I had opened it. 
Exhausted, we crawled into our beds. We had bit off a big chunk of the 30 mile stretch. But would it be enough? Tomorrow would be hard","Hogan Rd
",Full Goose Shelter,"Aug 21, Tue",20.70
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601226,"If I was going to quit on a bad day, today would have been it. I’d like to say it was my worst day on the trail, but that may only be true because it is the freshest in my mind and I haven’t yet fully “recovered”. Part of my misery was based on my own decisions and I admit that I set myself up for some of our troubles.
We were both tired when morning came. We knew it would be a difficult day and we tried our best to get moving early. 
Cole had left his sox outside overnight and they were wet. We had left most of our extra clothes behind to make our packs lighter, but I did have my heavy sleeping sox. He was was able to stretch my sox enough to get them on his feet which are four sizes larger than mine.
 When our neighbours emerged from their tent I apologized for our late arrival. They were very gracious about it.
It was 7:30 when we headed out.
It began to rain shortly before we reached Mahoosuc Notch. I’m not quite sure how to describe this part of the trail in order to do it justice, but I will try. It is a deep ravine with steep inclines on both sides. Down the middle it looks like someone haphazardly threw a huge pile of giant jagged boulders. There are gaps between the rocks, around them and under them. On a nice bright sunny day, this traverse would have been difficult and treacherous. But it wasn’t bright and sunny. It was gloomy and pouring down rain. 
“I don’t like this mom.”
After 1900 miles of hiking, I think that was the very first time Cole has expressed negative feelings about the trail.
We were both nervous as we began making our way through the notch. Cole paused to examine every obstacle to find a way across. I was in front of him and hoped he would just repeat whatever I did, but that just isn’t Cole.
I was getting frustrated with him because he constantly wanted to be on his feet, using his poles for support. I wanted him to put at least one pole away and get his centre of gravity lower. 
Sit on your bum! 
Crawl on your knees! 
We were both upset. I was worried. He was nervous.
At one difficult descent I had him lower himself down on his stomach. He couldn’t see his own feet and that scared him. I could see them though. He was six inches above the next rock but was too frightened to drop down. He just kept saying “I can’t mom! I can’t mom!”
At another obstacle he needed to move from one rock to another that was higher up. There was a big gap between the two. I was already across and I asked him if he wanted a hand. He said yes. I guess we both had different ideas about what  I should be doing to help him. He took my hand and I pulled. He hadn’t needed me to pull. He began shouting in fear “Mom! Mom! Mom!” I couldn’t see his feet on the other side, so I didn’t realize that I had pulled him from the edge. I just hung on tightly saying “I’ve got you, I’ve got you.”
I got him up onto to the rock and we both just stood there crying. He was so frightened and I was upset that he was so frightened and feeling sick to my stomach that I had almost made him fall. We couldn’t even move on for a while. 
With our lack of movement and the rain pouring down on us we quickly became cold. Even once we started moving again we weren’t exerting enough energy to warm ourselves up. We were shivering and Cole said that his hands were not working the way they should.
We tucked ourselves under a rock out of the rain and I told him to put his fleece on under his rain coat. His fleece was wet because he had been hiking in it when the rain began. 
“Putting on more wet layers doesn’t warm you up.” He argued. Even being cold, tired and frightened he still had the energy to argue.
“Your fleece will keep you warm even if it is wet. Just put it on!” 
He did. I put mine on too, thankful that we had brought them. I told him to get a snack out of his bag too. I think I heard that eating before you go to bed will help warm you at night. Maybe it would help now too. 
I pulled out my phone and checked Guthooks to see how much further we had to go in the Notch. Mahoosuc Notch was one mile long. We had only come .4 of a mile.
It took us over four hours to complete the one mile stretch. We were greatly relieved when we reached the end of it, but our day wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.
We were completely drenched from head to foot as we came out of Mahoosuc Notch and began to climb the Mahoosuc Arm. This is the steepest mile on the AT. It was pretty much a series of almost vertical rock slabs. Some sections were steeper than others, but due to the rain, most of it had been transformed into a fast flowing stream. We didn’t really even bother trying to avoid the water. Our feet were soaked already. The climb was slow, but there were enough trees and footholds to scale the rocks without worry.
We paused at Speck Pond  Shelter to eat. I rung out my sox and emptied the water from my shoes as well. Both were pointless endeavours. Then we began another climb up Old Speck. This climb was a steep vertical slab of rock as well, but there was one major factor that made it much more frightening than The Arm. This climb was above tree level and the wind was fierce and strong as it howled around us. 
“Put those poles away! Get low!”
This time he listened. 
“If you’re frightened or feeling unsteady, just get lower.”
He got lower.We reached a spot where a few trees had miraculously managed to grow and they blocked wind.
“Can we just stop here for a rest?” Cole wanted to know. 
“Just for a bit.”  The day was getting late. 
Eventually we got back down below tree line. The descent was not nearly as tricky as the climb up had been. We traversed a boggy bald with boardwalk boards that sank an inch below the water and mud, but what did it matter by now.
I felt done. Tired. Wet. Cold. Upset over what had happened on the rocks in the notch. 
Down down we went. 
The sun came out.
A fast flowing stream cascaded down alongside the trail and we passed a woman meditating on a rock in the middle of it.
An opening in the trees gave us a window to a view of the mountains that we had probably already, or would be climbing.
The AT was smiling at me.
Are you kidding me! After all that you put me through today you have the nerve to smile at me?
I took out my camera and snapped a photo, one of very few I had taken all day. 
Mark and Evan were waiting for us at Grafton Notch. Happily I limped to the van and curled under the towel Mark handed me. I really really was ready to be done.","Full Goose Shelter

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601402,"After every hard day or series of hard days, clean clothes, sleep and food usually sort me out and set my brain back on hiking. Not today.
Mark needs to be back home for Friday evening. It’s an eleven hour drive. Originally his plan had been to take us to the trail today in the morning, then head towards home.
Cole wanted to take a zero. I wanted to be with my family a bit longer.
Mark agreed to hold off heading home until later in the day.
I tried to sleep in, but I’ve never been good at that. Mark did our laundry.....again! I worked on my journal. Slowly we packed up our campsite and I went through our back packing gear and loaded up our bags once again. 
By noon we pulled out of White Birches.  We stopped to get lunch and pick up a few last minute things at Walmart, then drove the forty minutes to the trailhead. It went by all too quickly.
The Grafton Notch parking lot was full of cars and people when we arrived. There was trail magic happening. We didn’t need food, we were stuffed. However, there was a gentleman giving away free Farm to Feet sox in exchange for a picture and our story about why we were hiking the AT.
“I don’t want free sox.” Cole grumbled.
“Oh yes you do!” I retorted. “Come on and get your picture taken!”
I briefly told our story. We posed. We got free sox.
Goodbyes seem to be getting harder and harder. Evan always knows what to say to tug on my heartstrings. 
“I want you to finish mom, but I’m tired of you being away from home. I cry every time we leave ya know.”
“I cry too.” I replied. “We’re almost done honey. I’ll be home soon.”
Climbing up out of the notch, the terrain was fairly easy. Our destination was Fry Notch Lean-to, just under six miles away. After hiking for only two miles, Cole said “Mom, I don’t even want to hike six miles today. I’m too tired.”
Cole almost always wants to hike. 
I checked our distance, then I checked the upcoming terrain. Ahead there was a steep climb on a rock slab. Neither of us felt up to doing that again today. Baldpate Lean-to was only .3 away. We decided to stop there and call it a day.
We set up the tent and Cole napped  from 4pm to 6pm. Then we ate supper and Cole hung the food bags. We were both under our covers with our eyes closed by 7:30. We had hiked all of 2.3 miles for the day.","Grafton Notch

Setting up tents is another, and what was once his favourite chore, hanging the food bags, is a third. He knows the regular method of hanging food bags and the PCT method, almost always  getting the bags hung just the perfect distance from ground, limb and tree. I learned today that he knows a third method of food bag hanging. It’s called the ITTTC method, or the I’m Too Tired To Care method. It is a good thing that the bears didn’t come hunting for food last night.
Now well rested, we were ready to tackle the steep rock slab climb. The ascent continued gradually for a while, as it had yesterday, but eventually became steeper and steeper. Soon we were above tree line on a lichen covered expanse of rock. Cole informed me that the lichen was called “map lichen”. He had read that at one of the huts in The Whites. 
The view was tremendous. The sun shone brightly and the wind was just strong enough to keep us cool. I was content. So content. 
The rock got steeper and steeper leading us higher and higher until we reached the top of Baldpate Easr. We continued to enjoy beautiful views as we traversed the summit and then made our way back down below the trees. This is exactly what every hard climb should reward us with. 
The terrain was a bit easier in the afternoon and we were able to move a little faster.
When we reached Jall Mountain Lean-To, there was absolutely nobody around. Nobody in the shelter and nobody in the tenting area. We decided to spread ourselves out in the shelter. Although I get my best sleep in the tent, I have had some pretty good nights in shelters too when it has been quiet and we have been alone. The problem was, we weren’t alone. As soon as the sky began to darken we were joined by a visitor, a four legged pesky one who came looking for scraps. Cole threw his rock bag at the mouse but missed. He also incidentally left a snickers bar wrapper laying about. The mouse quickly found it and was not shy about helping himself in our presence.
Great! We’ve now contributed to the rodent problem at this shelter.
We banged on the floor. The mouse retreated to the roof. I grabbed my trekking pole and banged on the ceiling. The pest scurried across the roof. 
As I laid there trying to sleep, I heard a very faint “ting” sound as something very tiny hit the tin roof. Whatever it was then rolled down the roof with a soft “diddle diddle diddle”. Not long later, I heard it again. “ting.....diddle diddle diddle” I wacked the ceiling again with my trekking pole. That little brat was up there pooping on the roof. 
It happened again and again. Throughout the night our overnight guest was either scurrying about on the platform beside us, playing with Cole’s Snickers wrapper or tinging his turds off the roof of the shelter. Cole slept through most of it, opening his eyes briefly once when I hissed at the rodent. I informed Cole that the mouse had taken off with his wrapper and was busy crinkling it somewhere. I guess he is practicing the ITTTC method of “Leave No Trace” as well because he simply rolled over and fell back to sleep. I wish I could have done the same as easily.","BaldpateLean-to

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601541,"Cole has decided that he has a calcium deficiency. He doesn’t have any physical symptoms that would suggest this, he has just decided that he hasn’t had much milk to drink on the trail so he must be lacking calcium. At home he drinks litres and litres of milk. 1% milk. He has had many opportunities to drink milk in the past few months, but most of the time it is 2% milk, so he curls his nose up at it. Well, the situation has now become so dire that he has lowered his standards greatly and is now more than willing to drink powered milk. My powered milk! I’ve been carrying powered milk so that I can make carnation  breakfast essentials. This week I also packed out cereal and a bowl so I needed milk for that. This morning I made two litres of milk. He drank a litre and also wanted some for a bowl of cereal. My cereal! Sheesh! It’s a good thing that I love that kid.
Cole retrieved his snickers bar wrapper before we set out. A little late, but at least not never. He took a spill five minutes into our hike, scraping his wrist on a rock. “No worries, I don’t need that to hike.” He said.
The climbing was a bit harder today and there were little to no views to reward us for our efforts. 
By 11:00am we had only gone four miles when we came across people lugging coolers, boxes and bags, tables and chairs and more, across a stream. They were preparing to set up trail magic. It looked like they were a long way from being ready. They gave us pop and cookies and invited us to stay. We wanted to. We really really wanted to.
“It will be worth it,” the gentleman told us. “We are going to have lobster.”
Lobster! That might just have made it worth, but more than food, we wanted miles. We are getting so close to the end now and we just want to get there. We haven’t seen more than two NOBOs in the last two days. I feels like they all took off sprinting to the finish line, leaving us in their dust. I don’t have any sprinting left in me, but I am still moving forward. Slow and steady.
So, we passed up the feast and continued on, slow and steady.
We were headed for a campsite at the bottom of Bemis mountain, but as the day progressed it became clear that we were not going to make it before dark. I was hobbling along, walking sideways down inclines to try to keep less pressure on the ball of my right foot. I wasn’t going to hike in the dark.
 About a mile from the Lean-to on Bemis Mountain, Cole went ahead to set up the tent. I sat for a long while. Then I walked for a bit. Then I sat. I took pictures of mushrooms, moss and lichen, making up funny names for them and not really caring too much what they were actually called. I sat some more and cried over my foot. Why must Katahdin be so far away?","Hall Mountain Lean-to

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601610,"The only other people at the shelter last night were two south bound section hikers. They were older gentlemen, finishing the last stretch of the AT. They had been working on it for a few years. They had a big fire blazing and one of them ventured over to our tent and invited us to join them by it. I declined saying I was tired. He stayed for a while anyway, asking lots of questions. Too many for my liking. I know he was just trying to be friendly, but really, I was tired!
“Did you Resupply in Andover?”
“No”
You didn’t Resupply in Andover? My goodness, how much food are you carrying?”
Pleeeeeeease, just let me go to bed!
Our neighbours were out before we were in the morning. 7:30 has been our normal departure time lately.
On top of Bemis Mountain we had our reward for yesterday’s climbing. 
Down at the bottom of Bemis Mountain we found an unattended trail magic cooler. Cole’s eyes lit up and he practically ran to it. I don’t get excited about those anymore since half the time they are empty or full of garbage. Happily, this one was stocked with cold pop, peanut butter and jam sandwiches and an assortment of treats. We both had a drink, a sandwich and a treat. 
We crossed a dirt road approaching a stream that the guide book said we would have to ford. In the distance we could hear an obscene word being emotionally, loudly, and repetitively uttered. 
“Somebody isn’t too happy,” Cole observed.
“It sounds like a chicken.” I said. 
“A chicken?”
“Yes, a chicken.”
I imitated the sound I had used as a child to mimic a chicken. 
“It doesn’t sound like that!” Cole protested. It sounds like a frog.”
“A frog? No it doesn’t!”
By now the cursing had stopped. As we approached Bemis stream we found a hiker sitting on a rock filtering water. 
“Hello!” I greeted him. “How are you?”
His response was a despondent mumble. Clearly he was the source of the chicken (or frog) sound.
“Are you NOBO or SOBO?” I asked.
His eyes widened as he replied in a bit of a panic “Why am I going in the wrong direction?”
To myself I was thinking, dude you are sitting on a rock. I have no idea which way you are going or should be going. 
I pointed the way ahead of us.
“That is North.”
“Ok, good. I am going the right way.” He said. Then, “Sorry, I am just ready to be done. I’m just so tired.”
“ I understand,”I commiserated, “ and sleep doesn’t help it much does it?”
He perked up a bit.
“No it doesn’t. You’re right, it really doesn’t.”
We exchanged a few more words and then moved on. 
When we were out of ear shot, I said “A chicken.”
Cole countered with “A frog.”
“ I don’t see how you could think that sounded like ribbit.”
“Frogs don’t actually say that.”
“Ok fine. You make the frog sound so I can compare it.”
“No, I can’t make the sound.”
“Then chicken wins.”
Back and forth we bantered for a little while longer. 
After the steep descent off Bemis, the terrain evened out for most of the day and I was able to make better time.
 We stopped at Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to for lunch and a rest. Our despondent friend was doing the same. He told us that this morning he had completely soaked his shoes while fording the stream and that is why he had been so upset. We talked more about being tired, about sore feet, about being sick of trail food, and about all of the other reasons he is feeling so ready to just be done. I heartily agreed with every point. But I can’t give up on Maine. She is beautiful and I want to see the rest of her. 
Tomorrow we need to go into town to resupply and so today we were trying to get as close to the road as we could. The easier terrain helped immensely and we made it to a stealth spot about .8 from the road. We had two dinners left, so we ate both. Full tummies! What luxury!","Bemis Mountain Lean-to

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601727,"We were not in a hurry to get moving in the morning.  The IGA opened at 7am, but who goes grocery shopping at 7am? Nobody.  I was already going to stick out like a sore thumb. I didn’t need to be the lone shopper smelling up the supermarket. 
From the road crossing, the IGA was about nine miles. A hostel .3 down the road offered shuttles, but I really doubted that they did an early morning run. I couldn’t even call to ask because they are off the grid and only check voice mail when they go to town. So, my options were to go knocking on their door to ask, or stick out my thumb and try to hitch.
“We will try this first and see what happens.” I told Cole, hanging my thumb in the west bound lane. The first car that came by stopped for us. The radio wasn’t playing but I could see the names of the songs cued on the screen. They were Christian songs.
“I don’t normally pick up hikers, but something told me to stop for you guys.” She said.
She dropped us off at the IGA and Cole stayed outside with our bags while I went inside to shop. They had some already prepared foods available, so in addition to our resupply items, I bought us second breakfast )bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin), a healthy mid morning snack (bananas), and first lunch (egg salad sandwiches). There was a picnic table at the side of the building and we hung out there for a long time, eating and sorting our food bags. Eventually it was time to head back to the trail.
It took less than five minutes to get a hitch. It was another lady. She said that she likes to pick up hikers and hear their stories, but she always picks them up when they are headed out of town, not going into town.Coming  from town they have showered and done laundry. 
“I have to apologize then,” I said, “because we did neither. We just bought food.”
“I don’t smell you.” She commented.
The woman who had brought us to the IGA had turn her air conditioning on full blast and cracked her window. We definitely smelled bad. Before we hitched back to the trail I had put on my fleece to act as an odour barrier. I guess it was working.
“ There is a joke around town” the woman said, “that all you have to do to find a hiker is to go to the IGA and sniff.”
It was a steep steep climb up Saddleback mountain but the views were spectacular. Perhaps even my favourite view yet, but I’ve seen so many I can’t remember them all. And therein lies the problem. After doing so much work to get here, I wanted to remember. I took photos. I took video. I posted on social media and sent pictures to my husband. All these were an attempt to hold onto and share what I’d never be able to keep or adequately pass on. This exact moment. This beauty. This peace. I wanted to sit on that mountain forever....or at least for a long long time, but eventually we had to move on. The view changed as we traversed the mountain above treeline. At one point we had a 360 degree view of mountains all around us.
“Well, that one that we just walked over is in the way,” Cole said.
“In the way of what?” I asked. 
“The view.”
“So the mountain is in the way of the view of the mountains.”
“Yes.”
Getting down from Saddleback was tricky and slow. We decided to stop at a campsite and tackle Saddleback junior tomorrow on fresh legs. We didn’t get very far today, but hopefully Saddleback Mountain stays for a long time in our memories.","Mile 1969.7

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601814,"Before we went to bed I had asked Cole if he had put his sox in the vestibule. They aren’t allowed in the tent because they stink too much and they usually end up outside. He said yes.
During the night I awoke to a light rain. Cole was crawling into the tent. “ I left my sox out there,” he said.
“What about the boots?”
“They’re here.”
“In the vestibule?”
“Ya.”
I closed my eyes and went back to sleep. In the morning, the trees were shaking the remnants of the rain down onto our tent. I sat up and looked out into the vestibule. One. Two. There were two boots out there, not four. I rubbed my eyes, moved closer to the vestibule and looked again. Still only two.
“Oh Cole!” I cried. “My boots aren’t here!”
It was completely my own fault. I’m the one who had left them outside. I couldn’t pass the blame by expecting a half asleep teen to check on them for me. 
Wet feet means sore feet. 
You must get so tired of reading about my feet. I know I get tired of writing about them, but my days are  dictated by my feet, right foot particularly. How far, fast and long we hike every day is often determined by my foot. My mood, my attitude, my level of patience and how I respond to people are often determined by how much my foot hurts. It shouldn’t. When I saw that my boots were not under the vestibule my reaction was big and dramatic. I was instantly miserable and almost to tears. 
Cole scrambled out of bed and went to check on the boots.
“Mom, guess what! Your hat was over your boots!”
Sure enough, last night I had tossed my hat onto my boots, perfectly covering the openings at the top. The outside of the boots were wet, but the hat had kept the insides dry.
Thank you Lord for little miracles like dry boots!!
Once we got hiking we were also thankful that we had not tried to tackle Saddleback Jr the previous day. It was steep and tricky. At the top, the only view was of the clouds. Lone Mountain, Spaulding Mountain and Sugarloaf Mountain didn’t offer up anything better.
At Popular Ridge Lean-to there was a picture of “Inchworm”. The hiker who had gone off trail a few years ago and never found her way back. Her body was recovered a couple of years later. She had died of starvation. We talked about that for a long time as we continued down the trail. Cole likes to venture a long way off the trail if he has to dig a cat hole and it always makes me nervous that he won’t find his way back. He just keeps telling me, “I’ve got a good sense of direction mom!”
One other thing sticks out in my mind from today. At one point during the day, Cole stopped and called me to come back to where he was at on the trail. 
“Can you take a picture of these?” he asked. He was looking at flowers. “ I think they might be pitcher plants, but I am not sure.”
We homeschool our boys. A couple of years ago we were working through a science curriculum that focused on botany. Cole had learned about pitcher plants then. I was impressed that he had noticed the flowers and happy he had remembered something from a lesson learned long ago. Mostly I was pleased to see that he wasn’t just putting in miles. He was actually paying attention to his surroundings and taking in the trail.","Redington Campsite

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601926,"When we woke up in the morning our air mattresses were overlapping in the middle of the tent and we were encroaching on each other’s space. (translation: Cole’s elbow was practically up my nose) We had arrived near sunset at a stealth camping location mentioned by a user on Guthooks. Our tenting options were a rocky area, a rooty area or a sloped area. We chose the sloped area. We were at a high elevation and the wind was howling. The trees around us were swaying in the wind and Cole was certain that they were going to topple over. Remembering what had happened to Beats, he checked for loose branches, or widow makers as they are called. 
We had a sporadic Verison signal and so I sent Mark a message. “Please pray that the trees don’t fall over.” 
I don’t think that either of us slept very well. By morning we were both still tired, but the trees remained upright. I made certain to send Mark another message before we headed out. “The trees stayed up!”
We worked hard climbing Crocker Mountain and had a few views. On the way down we passed the 2000 mile mark. We have hiked over 2000 miles now. 
Unbelievable! 
Incomprehensible! 
We passed highway 27 and our last chance to Resupply before Caratunk. I was a bit nervous about being able to do the miles we would need to do to get there before running out of food, but I sure didn’t want to carry more food either. 
The weather forecast had been calling for a thunderstorm, but the sky was bright, blue and clear as we started up onto the bigelow range. We were about a mile and a half from the next shelter when it clouded over. The sky rumbled and then it began to rain. The thunder got louder and louder...and we were climbing! Then lightening. The safest place for us was the shelter, but we still had to climb further up before the trail would bring us back down again to Horns Pond Lean-to. I remembered that there was a lookout at the top, but couldn’t remember if it was above treeline. My phone doesn’t work in the rain so I didn’t even bother trying to check Guthooks. We just kept climbing. Up. Up.
We reached a blue blazed trail that led to the viewpoint. Relief! No open area to traverse! Then we started going down.
It stopped raining by the time we reached the shelter. Shelters, actually. There were two of them. One had two occupants. One was empty. We took up residence in the empty shelter. A late arrival joined us some time after dark....just a two legged one, thank goodness.","Mile 1992.8

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601936,"It was a misty morning and everything felt moist. The forecast promised sunshine, so I didn’t grumble too much.  Putting on wet clothing is gross though, and not something I will miss at all! 
I have to be honest. I was not at all wanting to do this day. Maine has been hard. Not as hard as The Whites, but still, the climbs are taking a tole on me. The day after day after day hiking is wearing me down. Both of us really. With regards to being out here on the trail, Cole has had a positive attitude and has been driven since day one. Though he has a lot he likes to complain about, being out here hasn’t been one of them. However, lately his attitude has slightly been changing. He will say things like;
“I’m tired of putting this backpack on.  I’m ready to be done.”
So I will ask, “Did you want me to call dad to come?”
“No, I still want to finish.”
The Bigelows are supposed to be our last big climb. Southbounders had told us that they were difficult. We can look at the elevation on Guthooks or the trail guide, but that doesn’t tell us what the terrain will be like. Back in the Whites at one of the shelters, there was some banter going on between the NOBOs and the SOBOs. The basic gist of it was, NOBOs shouldn’t trust SOBOs and visa-versa. It is all about perspective I think. Over 2000 miles of hiking, my perspective has certainly changed. At this point, SOBOs only have a couple of hundred miles under their feet. How they view the difficulty of something might differ greatly from how a NOBO sees it. I had that in the back of my mind, but was still dreading the day. As it turned out, the Bigelows weren’t so bad after all. 
A misty morning meant clouds and no views. 
As we were coming down off of Avery Peak, we came upon two hikers that we had not seen in months; Amazonian and Chomba Womba. I was overjoyed. We stopped and talked and talked. Chomba had taken a fall and they had gotten off trail for a few weeks. Then they flipped up to Katahdin and were now headed south. Surprisingly, seeing them really changed my outlook and attitude for the day. The promised sunshine made an appearance and I am certain that helped too. We found ourselves a lovely unmarked lookout to enjoy our lunch and dry out our sox. Then we set out to attack Little Bigelow Mountain. Not only did it give us a view, but the climb was no big deal. Still, the relatively flat terrain that followed was very welcome.
We stopped at a campsite on Flagstaff Lake. The air was quite cool and I was happy for all of my warm layers. In the distance we heard the call of a loon. Then another, closer. I absolutely love that sound. It reminds me of home.","Horns Pond Lean-to
",Flagstaff Lake Campsite,"Aug 30, Thu",12.80
Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601941,"The call of the loon greeted us a we awoke by the lake this morning. It was a nearly perfect day for hiking. It was cold in the morning but warmed up just slightly so that we could hike in t-shirts and be a comfortable temperature. Aside from two easy climbs early in the day, the trail was flatter than we have seen in a month. I couldn’t believe how quickly the miles ticked by. 
We crossed swamps on boardwalks, walked around ponds and even crossed a small beach on the shore of a lake. That is where we had our lunch and dipped our feet in the water. We also paused at two different shelters to rest, West Carry Pond Lean-to and Pierce Pond Lean-to. At West Carry Pond there was a big rubber tote labeled “treats”. There was garbage and two rotting apples inside. On top of the tote was a bag of oversized marshmallows. They were soft and fresh. I ate two, but they were so sweet they made me feel ill. Cole gobbled up half a dozen or more.
At the start of the day I was thinking to warn Cole to be cautious. On the steep trails we have been so careful about every step, every wet rock and every slippery root. It would be easy to let down your guard when the terrain looks flat and easy. Just as this thought crossed my mind, my foot slid through a slick patch of mud and I fell to the ground, banging my shin on a rock. For the first ten  seconds it hurt so much that I was sure that I was finished hiking. Then the pain subsided a bit and I relaxed somewhat. Awkwardly I attempted to stand.....and succeeded. I guess the hike was back on. Cole had watched the whole thing. I guess my tumble took away the need for a verbal warning. 
Our goal for the day was to get as close to the Kennebec river as possible. You have to take a boat across, but it only runs from 9am to 2pm each day.  We wanted to camp close by and catch the 9am boat. A Guthooks user identified a stealth site about a mile from the river and we had our sights set on stopping there. However, when we reached it, it was already occupied by another couple who we hadn’t seen in months. We ventured about .3 down the trail and found our own stealth. We ate most of the rest of our food, leaving one bagel and a bit of cereal for breakfast, then we were under our covers by 7:30. It was a good day!","Flagstaff Lake Campsite

That is what Cole said this morning as we were hanging out in the tent looking at what is ahead. We might only have 11 days left and a lot of the terrain looks flat. 
He is so anxious now to get home. I am excited about getting a rest today. 
We ate the rest of our food and still with rumbles in our tummies we packed up and made our way to the shore of the Kennebec River. We were early. One person was ahead of us. 
We sat in the sun and chatted as a few more NOBOs showed up. Eventually we could see the canoe being loaded into the water on the opposite shore. 
Two by two we were ferried across. One hiker had to help paddle and Cole was happy to volunteer. He has paddled before, but it was a long time ago and he didn’t remember how. He picked it up quickly though. 
Once we were across, it was a short walk to Caratunk House B&B where we ate pulled pork sandwiches and milkshakes, and have been lazing away the day and planning the remainder of our hike. It’s exciting to plan these final few days! Our thoughts are, 2 days to Monson and another zero there. I want to give my foot another rest before the 100 mile wilderness. Then, 6-7 days in the 100mw. After that, 1 day to the Katahdin campground and 1 day to summit if the weather is favourable. There it is. The final days laid out. I’m so excited. I’m also a lot of other things that I just can’t describe. Are we really this close? Are we really still so far away? The 100mw sounds daunting. Is it?

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602175,"Our stay at Caratunk B&B ended all too soon. Yesterday had been very relaxing. Instead of running around trying to get chores done, everything we needed was all in one place. They had a small Resupply store which was good enough to do us for the two days it will take to get to Monson. I just had to bring down our dirty laundry in the basket they provided and our laundry was done for us. That gave me the opportunity to take an afternoon nap.
They offered to take us to a local bar and grill so that we could get dinner, but I didn’t feel like budging. In the resupply store they had burritos, chips and pop. That was good enough to make Cole happy who was deeply engrossed in a book he had found.
This morning, for $7, we had a delicious breakfast.
I slept well during the night, but was tired anyway. Cole did not sleep well and was quite tired too as we paid our tab and headed back out on the trail.
The weather was beautiful and although we had a bit of climbing to do, the terrain was favourable. Mostly we hiked together in silence, but when Cole spoke, he talked about being tired and having had enough of hiking. When I said that I hoped he would find something enjoyable about our coming final days, he expressed a desire to plow through to the end as quickly as possible. However he was so lacklustre that for most of the day he was content to hike at my speed.
Our destination was Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to, but when we reached a shelter four miles before that, Cole asked if we could be done for the day....and if we could stay in the shelter so we didn’t have to set up the tent....and could he go to bed now. He said that his stomach was upset and he didn’t even want any dinner. So we stayed, and Cole went straight to bed.

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602247,"Last night after Cole went to sleep, I sat for half a hour trying to fix his boots. They are falling apart little by little. I had been caring around a tube of super glue, waiting for the boots to be dry enough to attempt a repair. They only have to last just a little while longer. The glue seemed  to be holding them together and I crossed my fingers hoping they would survive the final leg of our journey.
As soon  as Cole woke up this morning I asked him how he was feeling.  He replied that he was ready to eat, but he still wanted to sleep for five more hours. He ate his breakfast, plus an extra breakfast we had bought by mistake. Within an hour of starting to hike, he also ate all of his snacks for the day. 
We had a mountain to climb first thing. It rewarded us with spectacular views. From then on the ground levelled out a lot, but there were constantly roots and rocks to navigate.
When we paused to take a rest mid morning, Cole sat there looking around us and said, “There are worse places I could be right now. I guess I don’t hate hiking right at this moment.”
I was glad. I know that he doesn’t hate hiking. He loves hiking. He’s just feeling worn down and ready to be home.
The sun was bright and the humidity felt a bit high, so when we reached a stream that we needed to Ford, I was very pleased to have to take my boots off to wade through the water. A rope was stretched across the stream to aid in crossing. It was so high off the ground though that I felt stretching up so high to hang onto it was interfering with keeping my balance on the moss covered rocky wet bottom more than it was helping. I let go of it half way across and relied on my poles to steady me. The water felt so good on my feet that I was reluctant to leave it once I had reached the other shore. I climbed up the bank and sat on a rock to dry my feet. Meanwhile Cole was already in the stream and had just passed the halfway mark. He was tall enough to easily hang onto the rope. As I watched him suddenly he let go of the rope and begin waving his arms around in the air. For half a second I thought perhaps he was dancing, but then I realized that is something I would do in the middle of the river, not Cole. He began moving downstream. I knew the water was not deep and the current was not strong so it must not be forcing him down. What was he doing? I hollered at him a couple of times but he did not reply. He just kept waving and dancing and moving on downstream. Eventually he made his way over to the other bank and backtracked to my position. 
“ what were you doing?” I asked.
“ There were bees!” He exclaimed.
“You were swatting at bees?”
“Well I didn’t know what I was swatting at, but then I saw the nest.”
Sure enough, in the tree that the rope was attached to on the north shore hung a bees nest. I must not have disturbed it because I had let go of the rope.
“I’d better warn other hikers,” I said. I pulled out my phone to add a user comment to Guthooks. Someone had beat me to it. If we had read the comments we would have known about the nest  ahead of time. Well, at least we didn’t get stung.
We had another stream to ford later in the day, but we were able to find enough rocks to hop on so that we didn’t have to remove our shoes.
We were trying to get as close to Monson as we could so that we wouldn’t have far to go tomorrow. We eventually stopped just over three miles from highway 15, along a snowmobile path. It also happened to be the route the AT once followed to get to Monson. We set  up the tent just off the snowmobile trail. I sat down to cook dinner while Cole set up the tent.
After dinner we took stock of our meager food supply. Two and a half packages of pop tarts and one honey bun. Was it even worth hanging? We could shove it inside multiple layers of scent proof bags and zip locks.
As we were contemplating this, we heard movement not for off in the trees. Something was out there and it was moving towards us. It sounded big and clumsy.
“Grab the trekking poles Cole!” I barked, thinking we might need something to defend ourselves with.
“I’ve got your boots!” he countered.
I turned towards him. There he was standing wide eyed with one of my boots on each of his hands looking like he was ready to throw a left jab at whatever emerged from the trees. 
Closer and closer it lumbered.
Before I could jump up from the ground to grab the poles, a big, long haired floppy eared dog bounded out onto the trail. It froze when it saw us and stared in our direction, probably wondering what we would do. We stared back, wondering what it would do. After a minute, it turned and bounded into the trees on the opposite side of the trail.
Cole and I looked at each other.
“I think I’ll hang the food.” He said.
“Good idea.”
As I laid in bed after dark, unable to fall asleep, the sight of Cole standing there with my boots came to mind and I began to giggle.
“What is it?” Cole wanted to know.
I mimicked his voice. “I’ve got your boots.”
“Whaaaat? I was going to throw them at it.”
“Throw them? I thought you were going to punch it. Why were you going to throw MY boots?”
Cole began to laugh. Then I laughed some more.
“Grab the trekking poles!” I whispered a shout.
“I’ve got your boots!” Cole responded.
And we laughed and laughed at ourselves even more. ","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602250,"We had just over 3 miles to go to get to the road leading to Monson, but those 3 miles seem to go on and on and on forever. I was tired and sore and ready for a nice long break. I also had a bit of a bad attitude that I blame on pop tarts for breakfast. They are quick, easy, contain a lot of calories and seem to be readily available everywhere. However they provide no good food energy. Another excuse for being grumpy....the glue didn’t hold on Cole’s boots. Duct tape would be our next solution!
Once we reach Highway 15 we started up the road towards Monson. Whenever a vehicle approached I stuck out my thumb. It took about 10 minutes before somebody pulled over to give us a ride. It was a gentleman driving a disability service vehicle. He lowered his wheelchair ramp and instructed us to get on. Once we were on, he raised the ramp up and we walked right into the van. He drove us to Shaws which is a very popular hostile and re-supply store in Monson. I had been very leery about resupplying here because I had read on guthooks that the prices were horrendous,  however they were really very few other options in the area unless we were going to try to hitchhike to the next town. 
Outside of the Resupply store at Shaw’s was a hiker box. A sign above read “For Shaw’s guests only” however, the lady inside gave us permission to look through it. I lifted the lid and the first thing that caught my attention was a pair of boots. They were Solomons. Aside from a chunk missing out of one of the tongues, they looked perfectly fine. Not really expecting much, I picked them up and checked the size. 11.5! Cole’s size! I couldn’t believe it. Cole didn’t look quite as overjoyed as I felt, but obediently he tried them on. They were missing laces and insoles but he easily swapped them out from his dilapidated pair. They fit. 
A song came to my mind. A children’s song that my boys learned many years ago at Vacation Bible School. I couldn’t remember much of it...just one line. It was enough to swing my hips and dance to, to the embarrassment of my son.
“Oh, oh, I know, ow, my Jesus provides”
Shaws did not have everything that we had wanted, so afterwards we headed to the town’s general store. It was very small, just as pricey and the selection was just as limited. However, they did have a deli and our tummies were very grumbly. We ordered sandwiches with turkey, bacon and avocado. They were delicious. We also downed a litre of chocolate milk and bottles of Mountain Dew. A giant sized cookie sandwich finished off the meal.
Once our bellies were full, we felt quite content. 
Now what? We really hadn’t made a concrete plan where we would stay. All of a sudden, I didn’t feel like staying after all. I wanted to get out of this tiny expensive town. I wanted to hike.
“Do you want to stay or hike?” I asked Cole.
“I want to hike.” He replied confidently.
“Then let’s go!”
As we were packing up, I realized that  I had forgotten to get toilet paper and a lighter for our stove, so I went back inside the store. Fresh fruit was on display and on impulse I picked up a bunch of bananas.
“Are you going to eat those?” Cole asked when I returned to our table with the bananas.
“Not now. I am going to pack them out.”
“Seriously?”
“Yes!”
“You’re bananas!”
“Ha! Ha! Funny guy!”
We heaved our food laden packs onto our backs and headed down the main road towards the trail. I threw out my thumb at the first vehicle that came by and it pulled over just a short distance past us.
“Really?” Cole said, amazed that we had found a ride so quickly.
It was a small C class RV that had stopped for us. The retired husband and wife inside were on their way to Katahdin. They were working their way through climbing all of the mountains in the state over 4000 feet. Our destinations were the same but our methods of getting there were very different.
They dropped us off at the trail head and just like that we were back on the trail entering the 100 mile wilderness.
We passed the sign warning us to be prepared because the trail was very remote. 
We walked a mile. Then another. Then a few more. Somewhere inside me a little bubble burst...a bubble in my brain that had surrounded this daunting thing called The 100 mile wilderness. I don’t know why, but I’d been worried about crossing it. I feel weaker, slower and more tired now than I have, and that made the task seem harder and more immense. But as we continued further and further I realized, this is just the same trail that I walked through yesterday and the day before. There is nothing here that I haven’t already conquered. There is nothing here harder than, or even as difficult as I have done before. I am strong, even if I don’t really feel that way. I’ve got this! As for Cole....there was never any doubt. 
For dinner I smothered peanut butter on bread and sliced up a banana for a peanut butter and banana sandwich. Delicious! I was perfectly pleased with myself for packing those bananas. I may not be as please hauling the peels around for a week though.","Mile 2073.1

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602489,"I messed up. Considerably. It is embarrassing to admit since we have been doing this for over five months now and I should have it down pat. Considering where we are now hiking, I should have been extra careful not to screw up. But I wasn’t, and now we haven’t got enough food for 6-7 days through the 100 mile wilderness.  We discovered this last night when we noticed that our packages of bagels don’t have as many in them as the ones we normally buy. Even if they had, I still would have been short. What was I thinking?
So, we have a new plan. We need to get to Millinocket by Monday morning at the latest. I have no doubt that Cole can manage this task. I’m the weakest member of this duo. I’m also the one who messed up. So, I’m going to have to work hard and press on with everything I’ve got. When I  hurt, I’m just going to have to suck it up. We’ve done these kind of miles before and we’ll do them again.
The first half of the 100mw is the most difficult. We managed almost 16 miles today. We are hoping for the same or better tomorrow.
Since we did not stay in town the other day, I was not able to charge my battery pack. I will have to try to keep my entries short for the next few days. 
Something else happened last night. While Cole was hanging the food, he wacked himself hard in the jaw with a stick. I’m not sure how it happened. He was doing a PCT hang and had a stick attached to the rope. Anyway, after a considerable amount of howling, he let me look at it. The skin isn’t broken and he can move his jaw just fine. His teeth look ok too. I thought for a moment that we might be turning around, but I believe he is fine. This morning it was feeling better and there wasn’t even a bruise. He has decided though that for any future thru hikes we will carry a bear canister.
We forded a wide stream first thing in the morning. We climbed mountains. We scrambled along rocks. We hiked past sun down to get the miles in. Cole was  beginning to feel anxious as we were climbing up a mountain by the light of our headlamps. A moment after he expressed his worry, we came upon a tent spot right beside the trail. If it had been off the trail, we wouldn’t have seen it in the dark. 
We did great today! Pressing on tomorrow.","Thompson Brook

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602734,"Cole was grumpy this morning. I can’t blame him really. Tired. Hungry. Oh, and cold. It has become quite cold at night and it is hard to coax ourselves out of the warmth of our quilts in the morning. So, grumpy is allowed. However, being sassy to your mother when you are grumpy is not allowed. As anxious as I was to head out early and get through this wilderness, the sass had to be dealt with. 
When we finally got moving, we were both a bit grumpy. It began to rain and that didn’t help much. When we reached the shelter a mile down trail and went to gather water, it was stagnant. That didn’t help much either. We had to navigate our way down the middle of a rock slide on wet boulders. Not helping! I thought we both might suddenly be lifted from our grump when we approached a road and spotted a trail magic cooler. 
Empty.
We reached a wide stream that we had to take our boots off to cross. The water felt lovely.  On the opposite shore there were benches to sit on. I pulled out our cooking pot and made hot chocolate for both of us. We ate our bagels as the sun shone down from the now clear sky. A couple of day hikers forded the stream and chatted with us for a time. ( I didn’t think I would find day hikers in the 100 mile wilderness!)
When we got moving again, all grump seemed to have diminished . We had a long flat section of trail but then began to climb. We had four mountain peaks that we needed to get over before our day would be done.
At the next shelter we stopped for a rest. Someone had deficated on the ground right in front of the shelter. Who does that? I found a rake and was cleaning it up when I stepped in the middle of a second pile. Ugh! Cole pointed out a third so I would be careful not to trounce through it. I was disgusted and now smelled like poop.
 Sometimes people really really suck!!
On we went, up over and down mountains. The last one , White Cap, was the most difficult and the most rewarding with her views. The sun was getting low in the sky and we didn’t want to get caught on the rocky terrain above treeline after dark, so we couldn’t enjoy the scenery as much as we would have liked.
As we descended, a prickly bush reached out and grabbed onto my leggings, tearing a hole in them. 
Then...twing. I guess that isn’t really a word, but it is all I can come up with to describe what I felt in my back. I flinched and let out a little groan. 
Then again.
With every step down, I felt it. 
The shelter was not far off and we managed to reach it before dark. All of the tenting spots were full and all of the tenters had hung their food in the shelter. 
Say what!?!?!
I guess we were sleeping in the shelter with everyone’s food. 
I laid down on my air mattress.
Twing. 
Groan.
My boots were a good distance away, but I still thought I smelled feces.
We got our miles in and are in a good position to get through the 100mw by Monday morning. Tomorrow should be flatter and surely will be a better day.","Mile 2101.4

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602736,"The tenter’s food bags took up most of the hanging spots in the shelter last night. One last empty hanger was on the side near the wall. I hung Cole’s backpack there with our food inside. What did it matter? The shelter was already full of everyone else’s food. As I hung it I thought...I wonder if mice can jump. This morning I had my answer. Every bagel in one of the packages of bagels had little mouse bites.
“I’ll eat them.” I told Cole. “There is no other option.”
 I inspected the bag to make sure there was no mouse poop in it. Then I tore off bits of bagel around the bite marks and put those bits in our trash bag.I also sent Mark a message. Please pray that I don’t get sick. I have to eat bagels that a mouse has nibbled on. The poor man is going to be completely gray by the time we get through this adventure.
I moved slowly while packing up, testing my back to see what it would do. It didn’t like certain movements and reacted with sharp jabs of pain. 
I dumped the contents of my Advil bottle out and divided the remaining tablets into three piles. Three....the number of days we hoped to have left in the 100mw. Six per day is the maximum dosage listed on the bottle. I was up already up to 8. 
Our hike began with a continued descent down White Cap.  We had another small climb and descent, but for most of the day the trail was beautifully flat. There were so many lovely bodies of water too. Streams. Brooks. Lakes. Rivers. The weather was pretty much perfect. We walked through long sections of pine forest, and I absolutely love forests filled with pine. I love how they look, I take great pleasure in smelling their aroma, and I find joy in feeling beds of needles under my boots as I walk. There could have been so much delight in my spirit today, but there wasn’t. It wasn’t just my foot and now my back that complained. Other little ailments that had been creeping up decided to express their presence loudly and clearly, and I couldn’t even shut them up with Advil.
At one point I just sat down on a rock and cried. Cole sat beside me and scratched my back in silence. That is what I am supposed to be doing for him, not the other way around. I hate that he has to see me like this. We are so close to the end. So close!! I’m sure that I won’t be the first person to limp across the finish line, but that is not how I had envisioned the end. 
I took a couple more Advil, bringing my daily count up to 10. Then I limped on. 
When next I found myself having to plop down onto a rock to rest, Cole pointed towards a sign right next to where I had sat.
“Antlers Campsite! Look Mom, we’re here!”

Still Sheila ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602894,"Antlers campsite is beautiful. Last night we set up the tent right by the lake. It was very cold this morning but it didn’t even bother me as I sat gazing  across the water sipping my hot chocolate. Wouldn’t it be lovely just to stay here for a whole day?
I have seen so many beautiful places along the AT that I would like to just sit and enjoy for an entire day. But, I am a through hiker, a through hiker with a time limit. So, hike on I must. 
Just as I had done yesterday with my Advil, Cole was counting and dividing up his candies for the remaining two days. Once I had discovered my error with the food, I had told him that he could not eat anything without permission. After putting a little aside for an emergency, we had divided up the food into five days. Now that we were so close to our goal and confident that we would make it in time, we incorporated the emergency rations into our last two days of meals. Cole was doing the same with his candy.
“Ok Cole,” I finally interrupted him. “No more counting jelly beans. We have to pack up.”
Today felt like a second chance. A second chance to enjoy the beautiful weather, the flat terrain, the abundant water in all its many forms and the pine trees. I had more success keeping the pain to a minimum and without the distraction I was able to enjoy the day more.
At one point we came upon a sign pointing us a short way off the trail towards a view. There she stood in the distance, standing on the opposite side of a lake showing off her beauty and splendour. Katahdin. She is spectacular. The sight of her energized me, motivating me to move a bit faster.
We are spreading out our food so that every couple of hours we have something small to nibble on. It doesn’t stop the feeling of hunger but it gives us a more constant flow of energy. In the afternoon we stopped for one such refuelling. Two south bound hikers past us as I curled my nose up at the cliff bar I was struggling to get down. I greeted them between swallows.
They responded with;
“There is a guy just over the hill with pizza and....”
Before the SOBO could finish his sentence, Cole was on his feet and charging up the hill. He didn’t stop running until he reached the trail magic. There was pizza, pork, bananas, apples, cookies and pop. I had a little of everything. Cole had a LOT. Our bellies were finally full.
About an hour before sundown and two miles from where we wanted to get to, my body just said ENOUGH! Cole found us a stealth site.  I skipped my dinner bagel and just ate a snickers before bed. We both had our eyes shut by 7pm.","Antlers Campsite

He opens the tent flap, crawls out, takes a step or two if he feels like it, then goes. This morning when I got up I found his wet spot where his trekking poles were. 
I crawled back into the tent.
“You peed on your poles.” I laughed at him.
“I didn’t.”
“You did.”
“I didn’t!”
He peeked out the door to check for himself.
“Oh.”
“You peed on your poles!!” I laughed again. Then he laughed, and I laughed some more. It wasn’t really all that funny, but for some reason it tickled us both and we snorted and gafawed for a long time over it.
We broke our own No eating in the tent rule so that we could stay warm a little while longer while we ate our bagels smothered in peanut butter and Nutella. I had packed up my mattress and was sitting on the cold floor of the tent. Eventually I said, “I need to get up from here or I’m going to get piles on my butt.”
“What are piles?” Cole laughed.
“I dunno.” I snickered,
“Well, how would you get them?”
“I don’t know. My grandma just always used to say you would get piles on your butt if you sat on the cold ground.” 
By now we were both laughing hard once more.
These are the things I want to remember: the silly conversations and the shared laughter.
We had a lot of motivation today to get moving. If we could reach Abol Bridge before it got late, we could buy dinner.
We had a little bit of up and down, but the trail was easy. Still, I struggled all day.
We stopped at each of the last two shelters and read through the log books. They were full of final thoughts and farewells from those who had passed through here before us. People wrote about missing home, and some wrote that they would miss the trail. They wrote about what they wouldn’t miss too.....cliff bars! I’m in agreement with that! Cole and I talked about these things too as we drew closer and closer to the end of the 100 mile wilderness. 
And then we were at the road.
The restaurant wasn’t far from there. We each had a burger and shared an enormous dish of poutine. Delicious!
Hunger. I wouldn’t miss that. Not. One. Bit.
Across the street was a small state park. With full bellies we wobbled across, picked a campsite and set up the tent right beside a lake. I crawled into bed. Pain jabbed into my back over and over as I rolled around on my air mattress trying to get comfortable. 
Pain. Of course I won’t miss it!
Cole crawled into the tent and I immediately sent him right back outside to wash his feet in the lake. Add that to the list of things I won’t miss; the smell of Cole’s feet filling the tent.
Originally we had thought that we might hike the next day up to the campground at the base of Katahdin in Baxter State Park, but as I laid there I wasn’t really certain what we should do. If I was struggling to hike along flat terrain, how would I climb a mountain? Well I couldn’t!! There was just no hiking left in me. None.","Crescent Pond West End

Cole was ready to charge back over to the restaurant for their all you can eat breakfast buffet. Ugh! I wasn’t. 
I moved to get up. Pain shot through my back. I laid back down and tried again five minutes later. More pain.
Eventually I was able to get myself up and move around. My back loosened up and my stomach relaxed so I took Cole back across the street for breakfast. More importantly, I paid $2 to get online so I could send Mark our plans. He and Evan would be arriving today to join us for our grand finale. 
I let him know that we weren’t hiking  today and told him where to find us. 
After Cole had devoured an insane number of platefuls of food, we returned to the tent. We both napped. Then Cole got up and paced around the campground while I slept some more.
Eventually Mark and Evan arrived. We drove into Millinocket and set up our family tent at Wilderness Edge Campground.
In the evening I sent a text to Susan to see how the family was progressing. Earlier Nick had been able to get back on the trail and they had backtracked so he could do the miles he had missed. In her reply Susan told me that Nick had to get off trail again. Tom and Gene were not quite at the hundred mile wilderness yet, and she had the RV in Millinocket....at Wilderness Edge!

Not so with a hiker blog.

There is an end to this tale, and I deprived you of it. I guess that I let you down, and I apologize for that.  I have a ""reason"" which is really not much better than an excuse.  You've followed me all along and I should have pressed on with my writing to bring you to the conclusion.  My excuse.....I was done.  So done.  My body was done.  My mind was done.  
But wait, let me tell you the rest of this story before I jump right to the ending.

On September 12, Mark drove Cole and I back to where he had picked us up near Abol Bridge three days prior.  I was in good spirits, although not without pain.  It drizzled a bit in the morning, but then cleared.  The ten miles to Katahdin Stream Campground was mercifully flat and sweetly serene with its many streams, waterfalls and ponds.  I was filled with so many emotions. I gathered my thoughts and using the voice-to-text on my phone, I attempted to compose a poem to reflect what was going on in my mind.  I didn't accomplish much.   We moved along at a good clip (for me) and by 11am we only had four miles left to go.  I sent Mark a text with our status.

Arriving at the Campground we scoured the area looking for other elated through hikers.  We easily located the ranger station and picked up our permits for the next day to climb Katahdin.  Then we sat and waited.

And waited.

1pm came and went.  This was our meet up time with Mark.

1:30 passed.  Then 2:00.  I had no phone signal.  By 2:30 I decided that I needed a plan to get us out of the park.  It was still early in the day, but my mind was conditioned to make sure I was somewhere safe before dark.  It was ten miles back to Abol Bridge where we could find lodging.  My fastest pace was still slow.    I returned to the ranger station looking for help, only to find that the ranger had left.  A few through hikers were milling about, waiting for her to return so that they could get their permits. I explained my predicament.  I didn't know where my ride was and was concerned about getting out of the park.  We had our backpacks, but with so little in them that they would not do us for the night.  No help was offered.

I returned to the picnic table that Cole was at and told him we were going to start hiking back out of the park along the road.  That way, if Mark arrived, he would see us on the road.

We donned our backpacks and headed out along the road.  Our exodus ended quite prematurely when we came to a T intersection.  Which way was the way out?  From which direction would Mark come?  We had no idea.

We turned around and retreated to the campground.  There were only a few cars in the parking lot, but no drivers in sight.  A hiker passed us.  I asked him if he had a map of the park.  No.  Of course not.  I returned to the ranger station.  Still only the hikers were there.  Ugh!!!  Part of my brain said, ""It is ok Sheila!  Mark is coming!""  The other part of my brain said, ""You only have four hours until sunset! You have nothing!  No food.  No shelter.  You have to take care of Cole and make sure the two of you are safe for the night.""

I told Cole to stay put and I started walking through the campground looking for people. I came upon a couple at a campsite who were unloading their camping supplies from their car.  I asked them if they had a map of the park.  They did!!  We began to chat and I explained why I needed the map.  We had something in common....they were Canadian!   They offered to drive us to wherever we needed to go, even all the way to our campsite in Millinocket if need be.  First, they had to empty their car to make room for us.  Back I went to the picnic table to update Cole. Before our benefactors had finished emptying their car, Mark and Evan arrived.  My emergency planning had been unnecessary after all. 
On Thursday September the 13, Mark returned us to Katahdin Stream Campground early in the morning.  We parked and Mark walked the first short stretch with us up the Hunt Trail which is also The Appalachian Trail.  We came to a sign-in station where we had to register and indicate which trail we would be returning down after we had summited.  I had done little to investigate alternative options.  Being  a bit of a romantic, I didn’t like the notion of summiting and then abandoning the AT.  I wanted to say goodbye to her slowly.  Or, at least that is what I had decided months earlier, before all of the pain.  Still, it was only five miles up.  Would the five miles back down be so terrible?  I didn’t know, but having not prepared to make an alternative plan, I wrote down that we were returning on the Hunt Trail.

 It began easy and gentle, but we knew it wouldn’t stay that way.  Soon the boulders began.  Still, it wasn’t so terrible.  Then came the bigger steeper climbs.  “Is that where we are headed?” we kept wondering, peering through the trees at rocky slopes.

Then we were above the tree line and briefly the trail was a rock face, completely vertical.  There were foot holds, cracks, and bars here and there affixed to the rocks.  Then it eased up a bit, but not much.  It was up, up, up.  Constantly up.  Climbing up on all fours.  Heaving, pushing, lifting ourselves up.  The entire time I had but one thought.  There is no way I can go down this!!  Up is one thing.  Down.  That is something totally different.   I found comfort in the presence of other hikers.  Not being alone seemed to remove a little bit of my fear, but not my doubt.  We would have to go down a different way.  For the moment, I just had to focus on up.

It was sunny, bright and hot.  As we climbed, a day hiker offered me $100 if I had a container of sunscreen I could sell him.  I may have unintentionally curled my nose up at him.  If I’d had it, I would have gladly given it.  Why’d he have to throw a C-note into the request?  As it was, I didn’t have it.  Although our backpacks were on our backs, they had been emptied of everything but our lunch, water, and the barest of emergency supplies.  Why did he offer the money?  Ok, so I probably stunk.  Our clothes had been laundered, but that never took out all of the stench.  Mark had brought us clean clothes, but I was determined to finish the trail in the same clothes I had started in.  So, ya I stunk.  Plus, my tights had a big rip in one leg.  I guess that looked trashy.  But I had showered that morning.   Did I really look so needy that he felt he had to offer money for sunscreen?  Maybe the sun was baking my brain, but I stewed on that stupid comment for quite some time as I climbed.  Finally I just had to scold myself.  “Shut up and climb Sheila.  Shut up and climb.”

The ascent was so slow going!  Eventually our tummies began to rumble.  We found a couple of overhanging rocks that we could just barely get our upper halves under to hide from the sun. We dug sandwiches and almond M and M’s out of our bags and devoured them. As we ate, we gazed in awe. The scenery around us was stunning.  It was more beautiful than I could ever capture in a photo, and more majestic than any combination of words I could ever come up with would accurately describe. 
  But soon, it was rocks I needed to focus my eyes on once more.

At last we climbed the crest of the steepest stretch of the trail, but we were not at the summit yet.  I felt robbed when we climbed over that edge and no summit sign greeted us.  We still had what seemed like a long way to go.  I so wanted to be done, and I let Cole know it, moaning and complaining along the way.  In retrospect, I feel sorry for the poor guy, having to listen to me.  
“You can stay here mom, but I’m going to the sign.” He said.  I shut up after that.  Well, I tried.

Meanwhile, back in Millinocket, Mark had received a text.  It read, “We only have 4 miles left and it is 11AM”.  It was the text I had sent to him the day before, but he didn’t realize it.  Thinking that we were already on our way back down Katahdin, Mark had sped back to the campground where he sat waiting and waiting and waiting, the tables having been turned from the day prior.

Along the last stretch, I quizzed everyone coming towards us in the opposite direction.  “Which way are you going back down?  Where does that come out at the bottom?  Are you going back to Katahdin Stream Campground?  How are you getting there?”  After asking  a dozen people, I came up with a plan.  The majority of people were returning down the Abol Trail.  It came out two miles from where Mark and Evan would be waiting for us.  We would go down that way too and once at the bottom, I would stay with the bags and Cole would hike the extra two miles to get Mark.  Knowing that we weren’t going back the way we had come was a relief, but we weren’t quite finished yet.

Up, up, up some more, but not very steep now.  And then, there it was.  Our destination.  The sign.  The grand finale.  The goal we had set out to reach 173 days prior. The northern terminus of the AT.  
I felt some tears threatening to well up in my eyes, but with so many people milling about, it was easy to suppress them.  I wanted to cry.  It would have felt good.  But I didn’t.  Instead, I touched the sign.  I took pictures of it.  I climbed on it.  I coaxed my son to be in a few pictures with me.  We lifted our arms to the heavens and claimed our victory. We had done it.  For those short moments, way up there on the summit of Katahdin, I forgot about the pain in my feet and my back and my fear of going back down.  I gazed around trying to imbed the view in my brain.  I wanted the image to stay there, clear, crisp, and colourful forever, not fading with time.  
Now it was Cole’s turn to be done, and he let me know it, coaxing and coaxing me to stop taking pictures and to get hiking back down.

“We’ll never be here again Cole.”

“Well, maybe you won’t be.”

“Exactly.”

Finally I relented and we turned away from the sign and the dozens of other people who were trying to do exactly what I had been doing....making the moment last.

The Abol trail was easier than the Hunt trail.  Please note,that is a comparison, not a description.  It was not easy.  Most of the first mile I spent bum scooching.  Once below tree line it did become easier.  Cole went ahead while I gave my feet the pleasure of going as slowly as they wanted to go.  Cole went the extra two miles to get Mark who was greatly relieved to see him.  
The following morning we said our goodbyes to Susan and her family and then headed home.  It was a thirteen hour drive.  I wasn’t able to help Mark out much, only contributing about three hours behind the wheel.  My cats curled their noses up at me when I walked in the door.  Little snots.  I surveyed my home in which my husband and son had been living like bachelors for almost six months. The fridge was empty.  The cupboards were full of instant everything.  Mostly it was tidy and the bed linens were clean.  Could I have asked for more?  Nope.  I was home.  
Once off the AT I wanted to put everything hiking related out of my brain and get back into a routine.  I homeschool my boys and we were already a couple of weeks behind.  I still needed to order a few books and get lessons prepared.  I also teach ESL on-line to children in China and I was anxious to get back to that.  I wanted to cook and bake my heart out.  I wanted to rearrange furniture and clean out nooks and crannies.  I wanted to play my favourite video game and start watching the list of movies Cole and I had made on the trail.  I wanted to play our favorite board game with the family and cuddle with my cats who finally decided to forgive me for leaving.   And, while I did do some of these things, at first all I could do was sit on my butt and wait for my body to heal.   Try as I might, I could not get the AT off my mind.  I didn’t want to think about it, read about it or write about it, but I dreamt about it every night.  I was done with it, and I missed it simultaneously. That first night home when I crawled into my bed, I told my husband that I had forgotten how incredibly comfortable our mattress is.  But, part way through the night, and on many nights since, I woke up uncomfortable just wanting to blow up my air mattress and lay on the floor. I wouldn’t say that I had a difficult time adjusting to regular life again. I’ve been blessed with a wonderful family and a wonderful life.  But I don’t think you ever let go of the AT once you have hiked it.   While we were on the trail, I remember saying more than once, “Why would anybody ever do this twice?” and yet now I sit here thinking that I completely understand why someone would do it again, and under the right circumstances, I would too.

As for Cole, he is doing very well.  He came home with no aches or pains, just general weariness.  He only lost two pounds, but he grew two inches so he does have some weight to put on.  He is adjusting to normal life quickly, but he does seem to get bored more easily than before.  At times like that, he goes for a walk.

I feel so blessed to have experienced this journey and to have created so many wonderful memories with my son.  We did not reach Katahdin on our own.  So many people helped us along the way and we are very grateful.  If you have followed along with us from the start than you know that I believe in a God who answers prayer.  His provision and protection over us were vivid to me from day 1 to day 173 and I give Him thanks.

Thank you for sharing my journey with me, and hopefully forgiving me for robbing you of a timely ending. 
Yes Susan Dalton, I guess I was trying to leave no trace. I laughed out loud when I read that comment!  Thank you for not letting me leave no trace.  Two of you wonderful readers reached out via email to check on me and I appreciate that a lot.  My husband has also been bugging me to finish and my cousin gave me a nudge today too.  Thanks to all of you for your concerns and for not giving up on me.  This ending was difficult to write and I’m not sure why because it is a happy one.  
Blessings,

Still Sheila
