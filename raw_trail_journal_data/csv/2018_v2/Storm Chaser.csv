Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601694,"Every journey begins with a decision, a direction, and a step.  30 days from now I'll be beginning my journey north from Amicalola Falls to Springer Mountain, heading north.  This is my first section hike and I'll have 17 days to get as far north as I can.  Hopefully at least up to Fontana Dam.  When I describe what I'm doing to people, the reaction is mixed some.  Most are encouraging, even if they can never see themselves carrying a pack, carrying food, water, tent, sleeping bag, and walking for miles and miles up and down each day.  A few hardy souls seen envious and have a dreamy look in their eyes about the idea of it all.  Others simply look at me like I'm talking about swallowing a spider.  Most think it's a bad idea that I'm going alone.Of course I won't be completely alone.  There will be periodic cell service to touch base with friends and family far away.  Plus there are many people on the AT and I'm not expecting a day to go by when I won't run across others on the trail.  But I'm ok being by myself too.  I'm really looking forward to being present for this experience and enjoying the challenge and beauty of the trail.I love to hike and to backpack.  Last summer my son and I did Philmont.  And it was hard, and painful for my son when he twisted his ankle on the trail.  But it was beautiful and peaceful too.  He didn't want to go backpacking this summer, so I planned this just for me.  I need time away from the city, away from the tasks that consume too much of my time and attention.  I need time in the trees, in the mountains, under the stars, freeing my heart, feeding my soul.   I have most of my gear, but am still changing a few things out.  Found out this past weekend that my hiking pants are drying slower than I like, so I'm going to replace them with something lighter that dries quicker.  Otherwise, it's a matter of weighing things, culling non essentials, packing some boxes to stage along the way, and of course doing the physical prep to prepare for the large increase in steps and the ups and downs that dominate so much of the AT.",,View Entry,"Aug 29, Wed",0
Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602594,"I'll be on the trail in 19 days.  I've packed, unpacked, repacked, unpacked my pack.  I've shed some things to free up space and lighten the weight.  I have a big pack, but I really don't want it stuffed full.  I've had to take a break from physical preparation due to some minor medical procedures, but I started back up again this weekend, with pack hiking and yoga.  I'm sore, but better to be sore now than essentially disabled on the trail.  I'll ramp up my stairs and my cardio this week.  It's still real hot and humid in Houston so I'll probably just carry the pack in the heat a couple of times over the next week.  I'm starting to get excited and am working on boxes I'm going to ship myself.  I'm sure the next 2+ weeks are going to pass quickly.",,View Entry,"Sep 09, Sun",0
Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603268,"My thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by Hurricane Florence.  I can't imagine being on the trail during this event.  I hope everyone is dry and safe.  I see that the closed portions of the AT opened back up on yesterday, which is wonderful.I travel to Amicalola Falls via Atlanta on the 9/27.  I'll probably walk up to the falls in the afternoon sans pack.  Friday 9/28 is my first trail day with Springer Mountain as the destination.  I have everything well organized and am sending myself some packages at a couple of places along the way.I'm getting really excited and looking forward to this time in the woods, and the people I'll meet.  At this point I'm wishing my 17 days on the trail would be longer.  We'll see if I still feel the same as I head north....",,View Entry,"Sep 19, Wed",0
Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603682,"I traveled today from Houston to Amicalola Falls via Atlanta.  It was freaky, but while waiting for my shuttle driver, Ron Brown, I saw two people I knew:  1) Peggy Garret a nearly blind woman who who I had volunteered with, and Elizabeth Chu, who married a college3 friend,  What a nice surprise and treat. Ron Brown has previously been a Ranger at Amicalola Falls and he was a wealth of information.  I learned for example that water will be an issue during some stretches which i hadn’t expected.  I also learned that lots of soggy hikers were coming off there trails which was completely understandable as it was raining hard on us.  I also heard many bear sighting stories and got real world advice in what to do, and not do.  This led to my first trail magic experience.  Trail magic is when someone does something kind for an AT hiker.  In this same when Ron learned I’d forgotten my bear whistle, he gave me one.  Thanks Ron.It was a great day to not be on the trail.  It’s rained most of the time I’ve been here.  I’m in a cabin below the falls.  I walked up to the base of the falls and then up to the lodge.  I was shockingly winded.  I can see why, when I checked the Fitbit, I’d climbed over 80 floors.  Tomorrow morning I get to do that with a loaded pack!  I’ll do that, then have breakfast at the lodge before continuing on the trail.  I’m hoping tomorrow is drier than today but regardless of the weather, I’m on the trail.Take care my friends.Steps: 12,300.   Floors Climbed:  93","Houston

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603735,"Today was my first day on the trail.  I’d slept 9.5 hours and was ready to go.  I was packed up and on my way at 8:00.  I started at the Visiter Center and hiked up, again, to the Lodge. With my pack it took a sweaty 1:20 minutes.  
I had a mediocre buffet and indifferent service before getting back on the trail.  
I’d decided to take the Hike Inn approach which added 1.7 miles but had a gentler grade.  I enjoyed grueling grades up, treacherous descents, and lovely flat areas. 
I saw a number of people on the trail.  First I was passed by a couple on their way to the Hike Inn. They didn’t want to talk. Then Dan and Greg passed me. They were doing a 3 day hike and planned to go to Stover Shelter, which was farther than I planned to go.  
A large group of teenagers and volunteers were also on their way down from Hike Inn. One old timer was chatty.  He’d been hiking the trail for decades and was part of the Appalachian Conservatory.  
I was feeling pretty shaky when I reached Black Gap Shelter.  I’d been having cramping issues with one thigh and the opposite calf.  I dropped the pack for 45 minutes while deciding what to do next. While at Black Gap I met George. George was finishing his hike tomorrow. He was southbound and had started his hike in Virginia on July 2nd. He’s done something like 500 miles.  He wasn’t sure what he was doing next and had slowed down his pace these past days. He was already planning his next long section hike for next year.  He looked a bit like a mountain man to me  
A father and son arrived while I was talking to George. The father was a year older than me and had hiked much of the trail. His son was on leave from the Air Force and they were doing one night on the trail.  The son was pretty wiped out. 
I ultimately decided to press on, slowly.  I caught up to 3 young ladies, Megan, Amy, Kim? who were starting a 9 day hike. They said they saw me at breakfast, but I don’t recall seeing them. They were also headed to Springer Mountain Shelter.  I may see them again in the coming days.  
I finally made it to Springer Mountain, the official start of the AT. And then onwards 0.2 miles to the shelter, arriving at 6:45, sort of late.  I set up my campsite as the sun was going down. It was quite dark by 7:45. I’d planned on using a bear locker that I’d passed while looking for a tentsite, but realized there was no latch, and I’d need to hang my smellables.  That turned into a hassle, mainly because I was far from the bear lines and in camp shoes not suited to get back to those lines.  
It took me 45 minutes in the dark, and three different trees before I finally was satisfied that my food would “probably” be safe.  The first two trees ultimately were too short or the bags hung too close to the trunk.  I was using the PCT bear bag method so I needed a pretty high horizontal limb to hang from.  I don’t recommend doing this in the dark. 
I thought I’d fall asleep easily instead I had repeated bouts of cramping as my body complained about its previous mistreatment.  Hopefully better tomorrow, which will be shorter and less grueling.

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603799,"7.4 miles on the AT and 17.2 miles total. 
Slept poorly Friday night and had lots of muscle cramping.  I didn’t get up til 8:15 and it took me awhile to break camp. Everything seemed to be in the wrong place, and I had trouble finding things.  I had a cold breakfast and left camp around 10.  
I caught up with Megan (Bear Bear), Amy (Machete), and Kim.  We’ve started talking about trail names and and Megan and Amy both mostly have theirs. Kim isn’t sure yet.  I walked with them through midday.  I learned they were all ICU nurses.  Kim is a grandmother and Amy has twins. 
I felt fatigued all day and seemed to have run out of gas.  Even going downhill, and there was a lot of that today, was tiring.  
There was lots of people on the trail today.  Probably saw more than a dozen dogs, including two German Shepherds.  There were lots of families, including kids and toddlers.  Even one stroller.  They clearly hadn’t followed the same path I had.   The trail crosses multiple places where folks could park, and park they did. 
We stopped around 1:30 at Long Creek Falls to rest, eat, and enjoy the COLD water.   It was refreshing.  I met Hunter at this stop.  The nurse trio had met him the night before.  He’s a young man who may be going as far as Fontana Dam as well.  
Hunter left first, followed by me.  I was tired and ended up going to the Hawk Mountain Campsite at 5:00, which was 0.7 miles before the Hawk Mountain Shelter, which had been my original destination.  I’d already emptied my pack when I realized my mistake.  I didn’t have the energy to repack and go on so I made the decision to stay.  I met an older couple and their friend who were southbound on day 7 of their trek.  They are going to finish tomorrow.  
While heading down the path to get water, I saw Hunter.  He’d made the same mistake I did.   He and I are both planning to get to Gooch Mountain Shelter tomorrow, which should be an 8.3 mile day which sounds easy, until you’re carrying a 50+ pound pack over rough terrain.  Hopefully today will be the day the body starts getting stronger, rather than breaking down :) 
I had no cramping today which was wonderful.  I’m off to bed early, before 8, and will be up earlier tomorrow.  I want to be on the trail before 8:30.  
Mostly sleepless night.  Started raining around 3 and was off and on for hours.  I fantasized about just staying in the tent but once I stuck my head out I saw it wasn’t too bad.  Of course the clothes I’d put out to dry overnight, hadn’t.  Took me forever to make water and pack up in the light rain.  I didn’t leave until 10.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603845,"Sunday was not fun day.  I’ve done 25.5 miles total.  Felt a bit stronger but still pretty weak. 
Hiked from 10-6.  Took a long time to get packed up.  I do still have dry clothes but my wet sack is growing.  Took around 1:20 of down time in the day. It was lovely.
Can’t wait to drop some wait on Tuesday at Neel’s Gap.  
Met M&M (mike and Mitchell) a father and son backpacking.  
Met Sweep, Bear, and Friz.  Sweeps was an Irish MountAin man.  His two kids were  9 and 10.  They were finishing on Monday.  Southbound thru hike in 99 days.  Wow.

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603912,"Day 4. 
Today was supposed to be my longest day, at over 12 miles but we heard there was no water at the shelter at that point.  Instead we stopped at Lance Creek, which did have water. 
I’d hoped to report that I’d turned the corner and was feeling better.  Instead it was a really tough day.  I’m not eating well and just am not hungry.  I’m forcing myself to eat some but really I feel ill afterwards.  I’m having serious chafing on my inner thighs :(.  Thankfully one of the nurses brought some A+D cream and I’m using that.  The raw spots are uncomfortable.  I also have raw spots on my lower back and shoulders.  It’s not all grim news as my ankles and knees are doing well.  
Had some excitement with a rattlesnake on the trail. Hunter saw it first and reported it back to me via some college kids heading in my direction.  I must have mistaken 100 roots for that snake, which I never did see.  
Hunter is going off the trail tomorrow to take care of some personal business and may be joining a band. We will miss him.  Plus I have good feelings toward him because he thought I was 40.  The three amigas are doing well and getting stronger.  It was weird for me to be bringing up the rear today, but I was just wiped out.  Don’t feel like I’ve turned the corner yet on getting stronger. 
The 5 of us had a nice dinner together.  Bear Bear pulled out a flask of whiskey which we added to our drinks. They made sure I ate some.  
Saw some beautiful views that distracted me for a while. Still felt run down after a longish break midday.
Learned that Mike of M&M did Philmont with his son Mitch in 2009.  I hope I’m in as good shape as Mike when I’m 60. 
Tomorrow the destination is Neel’s Gap and if I can get there early enough, a cabin and clean laundry (and dry clothes) awaits. 
I do have to leave early in order to make it at my current sluggish pace.

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603913,"Day 5 was brutal.  It looked easy on paper but the terrain is tough.  Gained several thousand feet in elevation before heading steeply down into Neel’s Gap.  
I slept ok and got an early start. I was second off at 8:45. M&M got off around 8:30.  I never did catch them.  
Hunter caught me around 12.  I saw him again at the top of Blood Mountain a little after 1.  I was pretty shattered but the views were beautiful.  Am dealing with some intestinal issues so was glad to stop.  This was around mile 5.  With only a little more than 2 down to Neel’s Gap.  A cakewalk I thought. 
The three amigas caught up with me at the top of Blood Mountain and we had lunch and took pictures.  Kim is struggling, as am I.  I signed the book at Blood Shelter and then met an older couple.  They had been here around 10 years before. And taken pictures which she subsequently drew.  She was 71 and he was older.  They’d come back up from Neel’s Gap to revisit this special place. It was really heart warming. 
I headed down, having no idea what I was getting into. It was very steep. I slippped and fell badly at 0.7 miles on the way down. I strained something (hamstring?) in the back of my thigh. It went pop and then cramped up badly.  I fell three more times on the remaining 1.4 miles down. It was not my finest moment. It was slow going  
I made it to Mountain Crossings just before 4, an hour later than what I thought it would take me.  I picked up a box of food I don’t want and walked to Blood Mountain Cabins. They’re doing my laundry.  Dry clothes, what a treat.  
I ordered two pizzas and 6 sodas.  I have one pizza and three sodas for later.  
I took a shower and was shocked by how painful it was. It was all the chafed and abraded areas. It was clear I’m in bad shape. 
I decided to take a zero tomorrow.  That’s a down day when you don’t hike. I need to heal some and assess my thigh after a rest day.  I was already slow and am slower with a gimpy thigh. 
The three amigas didn’t get into Nlood Mountain Cabins till an hour after I did.  Kim was really having a hard time of it.  I can relate.  This is so much harder than I’d expected. She’s decided to come off the trail tomorrow and is heading home.  Bear Bear and  Machete are continuing on.  M&M is also planning to keep goi tomorrow. 
I may have to follow Kim off the trail on Thursday if I’m seriously impaired.  Hopefully I’ll be mostly good by Thursday. Steps: 29000. Floors: 243","Lance Creek Campsite

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603937,"I’m taking a 0 today to assess my left hamstring. All the friends I’ve made on the trail have left. I saw M&M this morning and they gave me a couple of pizzas and encouragement to continue, even if I cut down the mileage further.  They were both dealing with blisters but we’re back on the trail with clean clothes. Bear Bear and Machete also left this morning continuing on. Hunter’s dad picked him up earlier this morning.  Kim just came by and is leaving too.  Her uncle is picking her up.  She’s exhausted as she’s sleeping awful in the tent.  Physically she’s strong enough to continue but the trail takes an emotional toll as well. I started the trip alone, not knowing anyone, but it’s hard to say goodbye to those I’ve met.   I’d like to think I’ll catch Bear Bear and Machete but that doesn’t seem likely. This is an intense experience.  Time moves so slow. I’ll stop to slow down my heart or catch my breath, then continue on. And then after what feels like a long time later I’ll need to do it again, but when I check my watch only a few (like 5 or less) have passed. It’s so different than normal, not trail, life. My hamstring is not any worse than yesterday, and it seems that I can do the things I need to do.  I’ll be in pain, sometimes quite sharp, but it seems to calm down.  I’m not ready to come yet. So I’m planning to be back on the trail tomorrow, though I’ll be going slower and have lower mileage targets.  Once I leave Neel’s Gap, I can get off the trail easily around 22 miles north of me.  If I find tomorrow I just can’t do it, then I’ll turn around and return to Neel’s Gap. That’s my plan and we will hope for the best and see how it goes.","Neel’s Gap

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604044,"Day 7
Wow.  What a day.  I started worried whether my hamstring would let me make even 5 miles, and instead I was able to do 11.5 miles.  I had pain but really it wasn’t too bad.  I was careful and shortened my stride and really focused on relaxing and conserving energy while walking.  The zero day helped me and I had a lot of fuel in the tank. I hiked from around 8:00 to 18:20.  Longer than I’d planned for sure. 
Water was an issue today and in short supply.  I was able to fill 3 liters and drink a 4th at Hogpen Gap mid afternoon and that gave me a lot of choices.  I could stop at any likely spot or continue on to Low Gap Shelter, where there was water.  
I crossed three named mountains:  Levelland, Cowrock (didn’t see any cows), and Wildcat (didn’t see any wildcats, though Kim saw one on Tuesday).  And also crossed two “tops” which seemed like mountains to me as I trudged up and down them:  Wolf Laurel and Sheeprock Top.  I guess a Top isn’t high enough to be a mountain but my legs and heart would beg to differ. 
I hiked alone but saw over a dozen people. 
I saw red tshirted Tom and Mike again.  They’re the ones doing southbound sections swinging cars north.  I may see them one more time as they move north, then hike south.  
I met George and Cindy twice and thought I’d see them at Low Gap, but they weren’t here when I arrived. 
I spoke at length to another George, who was on a 3 mile day hike. He’s quite senior and has been retired 16 years.  He’s a past president of the Georgia Appalachian Trail Conservatory.  He and Mike/Tom knew some people in common. George tells me that water tomorrow will be plentiful.  That brings a smile to my face.  
I met purple haired Michelle who was on a 10 mile day hike who offered to take me to get water if I wanted to wait for her at her car.  I saw her car but didn’t want to wait the hours it would take for her to get back to it. 
I heard from Kim that M&M we’re coming off the trail for good.  I didn’t hear why but my money is on blisters, the bane of hikers.  So far I’m free of blisters. 
When I was close to Low Gap I ran into a southbound guy all dressed in black.  He looked like a ninja hiker.  He was planning on 4 more miles.  That’s crazy as it was almost 6 and it’s dark dark at 7:45. His name was “Big Toe”.  Haha 
I met Sandy and some other dodgy guy at the Low Gap Shelter.  They are south bound. 
The last bit of drama for the day was that I couldn’t find my spork.  That made eating dinner a messy affair.  I was thankful when I found it with my sleeping stuff, which was the last place I looked.  
I sure am hoping that tomorrow my hamstring is the same or better than today.

Daily Miles: 11.1
AT Miles: 53.7
Total Miles: 63.3
Folks staying at Low Gap Shelter get up early, like 5:30ish.  3 of the 5 were ready, waiting for the sun to come up so they could leave. Sandra, an elderly lady hiking solo south bound, was our fourth.  I brought up the rear and was on the trail at 8:00.  
The first 5 miles were wonderful.  Easy terrain and slope.  Those were knocked off by a little after 11.  
The day was much harder after that, filled with treacherous boulder fields, steep descents, and grueling ascents. 
I saw George and Cindy who bypassed Low Gap and stealth camped a mile onward. There was also a young family staying at that location.  Father/mother and 3 girls, 4, 6, 8.  They caught me three times as I was either resting or making water.  The 4 year old was so funny.  She’s a red head.  Her trail name originally was “Cheetoland” because she seemed to drop alot of cheetos.  But she wanted it changed to “Babyland”.  She was having a blast hiking with her daddy And so funny.   
I wanted to camp at a higher elevation so that there would be a breeze and dryer air than the shelters which seem to mostly located in the gaps, with no breeze, humid air, and no cell service. The difficult thing is that this meant I ended the day with a tough climb.  Once I was sure I was going for it, I had an awful 1000’ descent, through boulder fields and steep slopes which eventually took me to the base of Rocky Mountain.  Note that this is singular, and yes I did see a lot of rocks.  I was exhausted at this point.  I crossed GA 75, which was heavily traveled, and started the slow 1000’ climb to the summit.   It was excruciatingly tiring. And took twice as long as it would have in the morning. 
I passed a young man on the way, but he caught me at the summit. I’ve given him his trail name of “Rambo”.  Rambo just got on the trail at the base of Rocky Mountain.  He’s pretty green but certainly game.  He and I camped at the summit of Rocky Mountain. It’s his first night in a hammock and he’s used to going to bed around 2:00.  That’s a hard schedule to keep on the trail.  He’s 26, and planning to be on the trail until it gets too cold.  I like him and think he will enjoy the AT.  Note, I sure wish it would cool off as it was in the 80’s and did I sweat :(
The campsite is good and we got here around 5:30, early enough to have time to easily prepare for the night. It’s 8:30 now and I’m signing off.  Sure is nice to be able to post in real time.

9.8 miles today, 63.6 on the AT, 73.2 total 
The day started off with some rock music and two guys who’d walked up Rocky Mountain in the dark.   They were a bit confused by our camp, but left after a few minutes.  This was a little after 6.  
I got up at 6:30 and packed up.  I left at 8:00.  Rambo wasn’t moving yet, and I didn’t see him again today.  
I did meet Dakota and Adam who were doing a time lapse of the sunrise while vaping pot.  They were pretty chill and had “run up” Rocky Mountain for the sunrise.  They were heading north but had no destination.  I was pretty impressed as I’d staggered up that same path the evening before and it was steep and hard.  
Heading off of Rocky Mountain was exciting because apparently there is a wasps nest on the trail.  I was stung twice before I realized what was happening and rushed past it.  I heard others had many more stings so I got out lightly.  One sting was through my pants.  Impressive stingers!
The descent down Rocky Mountain was pretty gentle and not nearly as steep as the ascent on the other side.  Yay!
Trails today were really the best and gentle I’ve seen.  No boulder fields up or down steep ascents or descents.  Nothing too precarious where you were worried about getting hurt.  It was still hard and tiring :)
I had some trail magic at Indian Grave Gap.  I met two guys, whose names I’ve forgotten. One was a local and the younger was visiting from Colorado.  I was low on water due to the dry camp and they gave me a cold bottle from their cooler.  They then took my trash.  These acts of kindness sure mean a lot.  I saw them later at the peak of Tray Mountain.  
I ran into Paul “Nav” again today on my way up to Tray Mountain. He has a great memory and remembered my first trail name “StormChaser”, how many days I was hiking, and even where I was going. He had swapped out his hiking partner (originally was his cousin) and was now hiking with his friend Dan.  They were heading south bound and Dan has done more than 50 miles recently.   We said a wonderful prayer for our health before parting ways.  
While getting water on the way up Tray Mountain I met three young men who were seniors at Georgia Tech.  They had a “love hate” relationship with the school.  All three were engineering majors.  One of them saw my Nalgene and asked where it was from.  I told him it was from Sea Base and a gift from my son Storm. Turns out two of the three were Eagle Scouts.  One had worked two summers at Philmont and was a Ranger when Storm and I were there in 2017.  He knew Mattie who was the Ranger for our crew.  Small world.  They were on Fall Break.  I wish there had been fall break back when I was at university!
Met three other young men at the top of Tray Mountain who were taking a three day weekend.  I’m really surprised at times how friendly folks are.  We chatted for close to 30 minutes.  One of them was an Eagle Scout as well.  They send like fine young men, contributing to society.  
I met a father (60s) and son (40s) who had found the best log to sit on.  I joined them and learned they were heading to Tray Mountain.  They told me how nice Addis Gap was and how steep the climb was up to Deep Gap Shelter.  I made a note of that. 
I met “PT” around 4 who was young woman doing a solo hike southbound to Springer.  She was trying to get to Tray Mountain, a tiring 4 miles mostly uphill from where I saw her.   She confirmed there was a water at Addis Gap. 
I wanted to make it to Deep Gap Shelter but just ran out of gas and was going too slow.  I stopped around 5 and am stealth camping at Addis Gap, listening to the river gurgle.  I took a cold bath in the river. It was refreshing :)  Bear Bear was giving me a hard time about mailing back my chair, and if she reads this I hereby agree that I needed it tonight.  
My sister asked me a simple question today: “is it getting easier?”  That’s a tough one.  Setting up and breaking down camp is easier and faster.  I rarely lose things now (big problem for many days).  I’m in much better shape, which really means that I stop less often, and when I do it may be more to clear the lactic acid in my legs rather than to gasp for air and to try and slow down a thundering heart (that was my first 5 days).  Now I just gasp while I’m walking and I slow down my pace to slow my heart.  But I’m drenched in sweat most of the day.  I’m probably drinking upwards of 8+ liters of water a day (and getting lots of electralites).  It’s warmer than I’d hoped (Low 80s) and like a sauna.  When I stop for any reason I’m throwing off so much heat and moisture my glasses fog up.  My fingers are often wrinkled because they’re so wet.  Ever try using an iPhone with wet wrinkled fingers?  It’s a disaster and that’s much of my day (I need facial recognition).   I had to take off my screen protector so I could even get access to my phone, and then I shattered the screen two days later.  I’m having to be careful to not slip into heat exhaustion, so sometimes I have to stop to try and cool down.  I’m also burning between 6000-7000 calories a day.  Think about how much gym time would it take to burn 4,000 extra calories, every day.  And who would do it?  You’d be in the gym all day.  And that’s sort of what this is like, except it’s not air conditioned, it’s humid, and you’re dancing your way over treacherous terrain (knowing you’re one bad decision away from spraining an ankle or hamstring) and you’re carrying a large heavy sack of potato’s that has straps that have rubbed you raw in at least 4 places.  A lady I met yesterday said she’d fallen the day before and knocked herself unconscious.  I do highly recommend it as a way to lose weight.  Who can carry around and eat that much food?  I’m probably running a calorie deficit of 3000+ per day.  It’s good that I’ve been preparing for this my whole life by adding fat to my body so I can burn it now :). This has been amazing, and I love the people I’m meeting, and the scenery gorgeous, but this is hard work.  I’ll be ready for a low energy vacation (with buffets and showers) when I get home.  
I’m very thankful that my strained hamstring is really not giving me any problems.  The pain is less each day.  I wasn’t expecting that but am so happy it’s getting better.  That may be due to prayers from friends and family.  I miss seeing you and that’s one of the hardest things about doing a solo hike like this.

Hiked 5.5 miles, AT miles: 69 miles, total miles 78.6 miles. 
The night started rough.  I was stealth camping at Addis Gap.  I was totally alone.  I was camping by river just off of a couple of Forest Service Roads.  Everything was fine till around midnight and I realized I forget to put some summer sausage in the bear bag.  That’s a major bear attractant.  I was freaking out.  I got up and tossed it as far as I could.   Thankfully, there were no bears or I’d have been white meat for a black bear   Needless to say I didn’t sleep well.   Then around 2:00 it started pouring rain and unfortunately I had a lot of water between my bottom tarp and tent   It was hard to get up to a wet campsite  
I had a hard climb up to Deep Gap Shelter and was glad I didn’t do it yesterday   I trudged down to Dicks Creek Gap and hooked it over to the Top of Georgia Hiking Center where I am planning to spend the night.  I’m glad I did   
I met 4 through hikers and had dinner with three of them. It was amazing.  I had Mexican food with “trailblazer” a Doctor from Wisconsin, “River Dancer” a grad student from GT and IDHATN (I don’t have  a trail name)   So much fun   They were inspiring   I met Wind Rider later in the evening.   These are great guys finishing up their thru hikes.  Remarkably humble after finishing this epic accomplishment.  I couldn’t be more impressed after meeting them.  
I’m back on the trail tomorrow.","Addis Gap

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604253,"I had a really fun day.  I felt good, the weather was cooler, the trail was pretty smooth.  
I did 12.1 miles, up to 81.1 on the AT, and 90.7 overall. 
It was a little cooler and there was lots of wind. It felt wonderful. And being cooler and less sweaty was a blessing. 
I said goodby to the thru hikers Id met the day before and whom were also staying at the Top of Georgia Hostel. Trail Blazer and Skinny Santa were slack packing. That meant they were going to stay another night at the hostel, and were shuttled down around 17 miles south to Unicol Gap   Theyd then hike north back to the hostel in day packs  I love that idea but havent been able to do it. Instead I carry my backpack everywhere I go   I feel so light when its not on my back  Riverdancer wasnt slack packing and heading south. I was sad to say goodbye to those great guys and applaud their pending completion of the AT  
There werent many day hikers on the trail probably since it was Monday. I met Ole mid morning. Hes another SOBO (south bounder thru hiker).  He of course knew the guys I met yesterday and would see them later that day.  
Later I met Mogli from Tennessee, another SOBO.  Hes 32 and a professional hiker if I ever met one. Hes an Eagle Scout who served in the navy, and now he hikes.  This will be the second time hes completed the AT. Hes done the PCT and the Continental Dive Trail. Thats over 8,000 miles I think.  He was really . Hed broken one of his hiking poles and was hiking with just one.     That was really throwing him off. He probably spends more time with poles than without. 
I walked through many places where I brushing against leaves or plants. I kept thinking about Mother Tick and her kids. Shes telling them here he comes get ready, one, two, three...jump.  I sure hope they missed. 
I had terrible cell coverage most of the day, unfortunately, so Im posting this on Tuesday  
I got to Muskrat Creek Shelter around 4:30.  I made good time and felt good. I met Saint there, a restaurant executive rebooting his life.  
Red Hot and Better in the Woods arrived a bit later.  The three of them stayed in tents. I spent my first night in a shelter. Shelters are the Ritz on the trail. They are roofed buildings around 12 x 15, with walls on three sides. Theyre known to favorites of mice and thus have been avoided by me till now. I really didnt want to get wet (it is getting colder) and rain was expected and did occur. Fortunately there were no mice (that I heard) and I slept well in the shelter.  
The two girls were leaving early the next day as they were going off the trail and getting picked up at Deep Gap.  Saint and I were planning to head to next Shelter and assess the weather.  I was dependent on him as he had cell service (I didnt) in order to arrange a shuttle pick up if we decided to evacuate the trail due to weather.

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604278,"Today is a very special day.  Today my daughter, Sophia, turns 19.  I still remember carrying her down the hospital hall introducing her to her grandparents. Seems like just a short time ago.  Happy Birthday Sophia.  I love you with all my heart. 
I know some of you may be worried about me being on the trail with Hurricane Michael looming.  I’m currently off the trail and am in a hotel in Franklin North Carolina. 
I slept pretty well in the Muskrat Creek Shelter.  I slept late and wasn’t ready to hit the trail till 8:30.  Saint and I agreed to meet at the next shelter, Standing Indian.  He had better cell service than I did and he was going to arrange a shuttle for us for Wednesday morning. We’d spend the night at Standing Indian and then return to Deep Gap to be picked up.  
It was a pretty easy and quick hike to Standing Indian.  I was there around noon.  I was wrestling with the idea of going on to the next shelter, Carter Gap, which was another 7.6 miles onward.  This would only be a little longer than I did on Monday.  But it would mean I’d be riding out the storm on the trail.  
I met a previous thru hiker who was spending the day hanging out at Standing Indian.  His name was Nacho Jim and he had a precocious lab/pit mix, whose trail name was Bear Bait.  Bear Bait hiked most of the AT with Nacho Jim. All places except those where dogs where prohibited. BB was very happy on the trail. 
I talked to NJ while I cooked a hot meal, and realized continuing on was a terrible idea. I had to summit Standing Indian mountain.  At over 5,500’ it was by far the highest peak I’d yet summitted.  It was also going to be a bit of a steep rock scramble over boulder fields and is difficult in the best of conditions.  It would be the toughest terrain I’d faced. The conditions I was facing were ugly. It was very windy (outer squalls from the hurricane), and very wet and slippery.  There might well be thunderstorms while I was trying to summit and I felt I’d be a great if unwilling lightning rod. If I wasn’t hiking, I was also quite chilled.  It sounded like the summit was going to be slow going and risky.  And then I’d be at risk at not getting to the next shelter before dark and I didn’t know if it was better situated than Standing Indian  
So it was clear I wasn’t going on. But I didn’t want to stay at the Standing Indian Shelter either.  It was very exposed, with winds blowing rain directly into the shelter. I’d have to set up a tent in the shelter and hope that would protect me from the wind and chilly rain.  NJ offered to take me into Franklin, and I took him up on his offer. While he was packing up, Saint arrived at Standing Indian and agreed that heading to Franklin early was best. So we backtracked 0.8 mile back to Deep Gap where NJ was parked and headed to Franklin. BB slept in my lap on the way down the mountain and into town.  She was very happy, and let loose some stinky expulsions on the way forcing us to open the windows.   
It was much warmer, with calmer winds in Franklin.  I’d planned to stay at Gooder Groves Hiker Hostel, but Zen the proprietor was stressed and short handed.  It made me uncomfortable and NJ dropped me off at the Carolina Motel, where I’ll stay the next few days. 
So Wednesday and Thursday will be zeroes. And I’ll have to decide whether to get back on the trail Friday for a few days or to stop early.  I’m due to come off the trail on Sunday. 
So for the time being I’m just relaxing and waiting to see what happens.  I do seem to have picked up a cold so it’s a good time to have downtime.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

The rain had let up and moved on by Thursday morning. I’ll spend another quiet and restful day in Franklin on Thursday.  I’ve arranged a shuttle to get me back on the trail Friday morning.  And arranged a final pickup for Sunday afternoon.

What a glorious day to hike.  I was dropped off at Deep Gap at 7:45.  It was chilly, in the 40s.  
I hiked up to Standing Indian Shelter with my jacket on before generating enough heat to take it off.  There was a Frenchman  there about to head off when I arrived.  He reminded me of the Parisian French.   He was heading to Long Branch Shelter, which I didn’t make it to today.
I’d been warned about submitting Standing Indian Mountain but really it wasn’t too bad.  I was at the 5500’ peak around 9:45, making good time. 
It was cool, with clear skies all day.  There was a strong breeze at time. Strong enough to blow my hat off at one point, which was a first for the trip. 
I didn’t see many people in the morning but met a SOBO thru hiker midday.  His trail name was “Hell Yes Jesus”.  He’d not been aware of Hurricane Michael and ended riding out the storm in a Shelter.  He was worried the roof would blow off.  Apparently it was creaking. 
I’d planned an easy day and intended to stop at the Carter Gap Shelter.  I got there 1:30 and wasn’t ready to stop.  So I went on. 
Option 2 was Betty Creek Gap tent site.  That was a little over 12 miles.  I got there at 4:00 and still had energy to move on, so I did.  
Option 3 was the FireTower on top of Albert Mountain.  It didn’t seem that far but the last 1/4 mile was a scramble on hands and knees over steep rock surfaces.  It was also 1000’ higher than Betty Creek. I think 400’ was in the last 1/4 mile.  
When I arrived, there were two seniors from the University of Georgia already here.  They’d driven most of the way up, bastards.  They were playing catch when I arrived. There was plenty of space for me so I set up camp.  The views from the fire tower were beautiful.  
Another group of two guys arrived and wanted to camp, but had no water.  I gave them a litre and they went onward down the mountain looking for more water and a place to camp. 
Then a group of four more college students arrived.  They’d had a long hike.  It was one guy and three girls.  And they had a two person tent for the four of them. That should be interesting. They’ve set up camp and climbed up the tower to eat. It may be a loud evening. 
Really spectacular day with lots of views.  I’m cold in the tent and about to climb into my sleeping bag.  I’m planning on an easier day tomorrow.

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604452,"Day 16 was my last full day on the AT.  
It was a lovely walk in the woods.  My pickup point was set around 15 miles north in the mid afternoon on Sunday so I was in no hurry.  
The night was very cold.  Everything inside my sleeping bag was warm, but any part of me outside was COLD.  I woke up before sunrise and debated whether to watch it rise.  It was sooooooo hard to get up, but get up I did.  I bundled up as best I could and climbed up the fire tower.  The two seniors from the University of Georgia were already there.  They had the right idea and were bundled up in their sleeping bags.  The wind was blowing hard and it was cold.  I was so thankful that I’d said yes to this experience because the sunrise was stunning, glorious.  It lasted for almost 30 minutes and played off a complex setting of clouds, constantly changing shape and color, going between hues of red and orange.  It filled the eastern half of the sky.  I can’t recall a more spectacular sunrise, and I enjoyed sharing it with Nathan and Luke. 
I crawled back into the sleeping bag to warm up and send out some pictures since I had cell service.  I tried to go back to sleep but couldn’t as there was too much noise.  The fire tower was a popular meeting point and when I got up there was at least 8 people and five dogs milling about   I got up and enjoyed a hot breakfast before packing up   
I was on the trail a bit late, around 9:00   I ran into Jason and Cross just below the peak   They were the two I’d given some water too the evening before.   Cross was not feeling well and looked rough.   Jason hypothesized it was some whisky they’d been drinking.
Most of the morning was spent going down, giving back the hard fought elevation gained the day before   Jason passed me twice but I caught up to him while he was waiting for Cross, who was vomiting repeatedly. I saw lots of hikers heading up to the fire tower on my way down.   Once I passed parking off of some paved road, I didn’t see anyone else.
In the afternoon I gained some elevation only to give it back later in the day.
My feet and knees where complaining about all the downhill walking today and I was happy to get to my campsite   It was a lovely setting just off the AT right by a creek (source of water).   I was setting up when Jason arrived.   He and Cross, who arrived maybe 30 minutes later, also camped at the same location   It was just the three of us   
I had a yummy chicken fajita Mountain House dinner with Jason and Cross  I learned they were both from Nashville, in their early 30’s and both in cyber security.  Jason was a sales manager and Cross a security engineer.  Cross built a warm fire which was welcome on the chilly evening.  They were good company.  They were planning a 22 mile day on Sunday but I’m thankful for my shorter and more peaceful mileage.  I have to push pretty hard to get around the 15 mile mark. I’d have to start real early and hike a loooooooong day to do the 22 miles.
It wasn’t supposed to rain Saturday night but it did.   I hadn’t covered my pack with a pack cover (sloppy on my part) so I had to get up and drag it into the tent.  A wet pack is a heavy pack.
My sister previously asked if it was getting easier.   I can definitely say that as I’ve gotten stronger, the terrain has gotta more approachable, and the weather has cooled off, yes it is easier now (now that it’s time to come off the trail).  Not going through so much water each day is wonderful.   
I’m looking forward to some elevation gain on Sunday and a peaceful finish for this wonderful experience. 
As of now, my total mileage is 124.4.

Storm Chaser,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604487,"Day 17 was my last day on the trail for this section hike. It was a wonderful day.
I slept really well despite the rain, sleeping until around 7:30.  I was slow to get up as it was chilly and wet.  It’s really no fun to pack up a wet campsite. My bear bag was fine and unmolested. I saw that Jason and Cross hadn’t set out yet.  I packed up everything except for the tent while I was making a hot breakfast (Mountain House lasagna). I’ve found that I’m getting hungrier each day on the trail.  
Cross was the first to be ready and took off around 8:30, followed by Jason maybe 15 minutes later.  I have no doubt that Jason will quickly catch Cross.   
I packed up my wet tent and set off around 9:30.  I had something like 6 hours to go 5 miles, so there was no rush.  
I found a cell signal not far from the camp and took the time to post yesterday’s journal entry.  As usual I forgot stuff I meant to add.  I’ll try to fill in some of that in today’s entry.  
I noticed today the leaves have started changing colors.  We’ve had a lot of leaves fall since Michael swept through but those were largely just yellow or brown.  Today there were reds as well.  I guess getting farther north, getting cooler weather has helped trigger the change. I’m sure it will grow in beauty in the coming weeks.  
The clouds cleared around 11:35 and the sun came out in all its glory.   You could those who’d spent the night on the trail as we all had our pack covers on from the previous rain.
I met several SOBO through hikers today: Whip and Hustle.  Whip was slowing down so his wife could join him for his finish at Springer Mountain.  She’d started his trek with him at Khatadin Mountain (sp?) in Maine as well. 
Hustle was hiking with an older man I initially took to be his father but was instead a retired local who did lots of section hiking.  Like a lot of the younger thru hikers, Hustle wasn’t using poles.  
I forget to mention yesterday that I met the colorful Turtle Wolf thru hiker.  I never did have a chance to ask him where his name came from, though I did have to ask him several times to repeat it.  
There were lots of day hikers out today as there was good access to the AT.  I guess I’ve been on the trail long enough to get the “look” because I was asked multiple times if I was a thru hiker.  I took that as a compliment.  
I heard from  Ron Brown, my shuttle driver, that he was going to be several hours earlier than originally thought.   That sounded better than a long wait so I picked up the pace.  He was picking me up at the Wayah Crest Picnic Area.
On my way up to Siler Bald (a bald is what it sounds, a naturally occurring open area on various mountain tops in the Appalachians, there was grass but no trees, but it wasn’t a tree line as there were trees that ringed the bald area), I ran across a group of Asian tourists doing a day hike.   There were something like 20 of them.  They were very friendly and gave me some fruit.   When I asked where they were from, they told me Atlanta, but I don’t think so :)
I descended from Siler Bald, meeting several groups/families of day hikers who all wanted to talk.  It was fun.   They mistook me for some sort of celebrity.
I was picked up by Ron around 2 and arrived in Atlanta several hours later.
I’m currently clean, and am drying out my wet gear.  I have a late checkout so I’ll have a quiet day until my late afternoon flight.   I tried to leave earlier but it wasn’t worth the extra money.
I ended up spending 4.5 days off the trail.  That meant I didn’t go as far as I’d planned, but really that’s ok.  I needed a zero early on.  I needed some half days to get to places where I could resupply and do laundry.  I certainly didn’t plan for Hurricane Michael and that cost me 2.5 days.   But it was all part of the experience.  The mileage is just a number, and not what memories are made of.
I’ll reflect more on what I learned and what my favorite memories are from the experience in the coming days and intend to sum it up in a final entry.
