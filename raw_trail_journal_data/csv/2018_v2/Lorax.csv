Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584061,"It’s finally down to one week until launch date, March 18, when my brother-in-law, BobH and I will begin our north bound journey.  Our wives will be joining us for a weekend of pre-hike hikes and a final few hours of R&R at the Amicalola Falls State Park before it all begins.
My thoughts and emotions are running wild from day to day, moment to moment; excitement, apprehension, confidence, fear, concern, commitment, doubt, eagerness, nerves, etc...I'm working daily to nail down the final stages of preparation and hopeful that everything will miraculously fall into place over the next few days.
Over the last month I've had the privilege to meet and talk with (at length in some cases), three successful thru-hikers.  Class of 2017 alums Maureen (Momentum), Maggie (Mantis) and David, AKA Loud Mouth from the Class of 2016.  All have been very open about their experiences, full of stories and very excited over my near term future. Momentum in particular has been a HUGE help in boosting my confidence and excitement with positive reinforcement and an offer to assist my wife Cathy, with any questions/concerns she may run up against in support of me…thank you Mo!",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Tue",0
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584467,"Arrived at Amicolola Falls on the 18th and spent the last day and a half hiking the grounds with our wives and shopping a bit at the local outfitters for some last minute supplies.The weather for the 20th is supposed to be OK, but tonight the forecast calls for fairly warm temps but very high winds, tornado warnings, severe thunder storms, 2 inch hail and 1-2 inches of rain and a chance of snow on Wednesday.  What a great way to start this trek!Ive been concerned about the weight of my pack but after talking to several hikers at home and seeing how much some of the packs of hikers taking off this morning weighed, I feel much better; 40 pounds is a lot, but manageable I hope and Im sure Ill find ways to lighten it up as I go along.Met a couple of guys from Michigan this morning looking for a ride to the top of Springer Mountain.  These guys were from Macomb, trail names of Amsterdam and Dog Breath,  the trail names are going to pretty wild Im sure.So now its off to dinner and then hopefully a good nights sleep before the boots hit the uphill slope.See you from the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Mon",0
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584699,"We got started a little late, but we’re off and it’s a great day to hike. The sign at the base of Springer Mountain said “strenuous”, which it was for the first day out and even tougher because around 2pm my legs started to cramp and I needed to keep stretching and drinking water. We didn’t make the Springer summit, but rather set up camp at Black Gap Shelter 7.5 miles in and 1.5 miles short. There were 8 total hikers that stayed at this shelter site.
After pitching out tents, collecting water from a local stream and cooking dinner, it began to rain and a heavy fog settled in. On the trail, bed time comes rather early and still being March, it gets dark rather early. Tonight it was around 630 and there was nothing to do but lay in my tent and read. As the temps dropped, the wind picked up to about 25-30 mph and the rain turned to snow.  Because I drank so much water in the afternoon, I had to venture out to use the outdoor facilities three times last night.  I also started to cramp up and had to go outside to stretch my legs several times.  of course it was raining and snowing so I got plenty wet and cold each time I went out;  it wasn't a very comfortable night and my sleep was quite restless.
In the morning I was not motivated to get out of that warm sleeping bag at all! The rain and snow had ceased but the wind continued and it was still cold, everything was covered in ice/snow including the zipper on my tent.  The rain fly did little to protect the zipper or my back pack, which I kept under the fly. I think my tent is too small, it would be ideal to bring my gear inside.  All in all, it is quite beautiful this morning.","Amicalola Falls

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584704,"Left Black Gap Shelter around 10am.  The climb to the summit of Springer was beautifully snow covered and incredibly windy/cold. But coming down and heading toward our goal of Hawk Mountain Shelter, roughly 9.5 miles, was much more comfortable and the spirits of our fellow hikers were pretty high. 
The sun started to break through a bit and the wind died down some after we passed the parking lot at the top of Springer Mountain and worked our way through some rhododendron weighed down by last night's ice.  We lunched at Stover Creek Shelter with a dozen other hikers, some moving on that afternoon, but many calling it a day at 2pm; as mentioned, My Brother-in-law (trail name The Mayor, because he talks to EVERYONE) and I targeted Hawk Mountain Shelter for the end of our day.  Unfortunately, The Mayor suffers from a recurring knee injury that decided to start acting up.  And the farther we went the worse it got.  Three miles shy of Hawk Mountain we were sitting on a log and approached by a trail ranger by the name of Warrior who showed concern for where we were on the trail at that time of day with the Mayor's knee.  He told us that if we made it to Hawk Mt. and his knee was no better int he morning, getting a rescue in would be very difficult.  instead, he directed us to Hickory Flats Cemetery just .5 miles from where we were. The cemetery is on the top of a mountain at the end of a fire road and populated with grave markers that are basically vertical stones without markings, but some that were marked were dated in the mid-1850’s.  Hickory Flats was owned (?) and maintained by a local Methodist church and had on site a large wood framed pavilion, folding tables with plastic chairs and a pretty solid privy constructed of cinder block.  In the rafters of the pavilion, the caretakers have laid out a couple sheets of 1” plywood, one at each end of the pavilion, for hikers to roll out their bedrolls and spend the night; one was called Motel 6 and the other Motel 8. I took off looking for a cell signal but had no luck, so we fixed our dinner, hung our food from a tree (due to the grounds being littered with bear prints deep in the mud) and settled in for the night hoping the ranger would check in on us in the morning.  
There was very light snow last night, in fact we saw splendid sunset just before we climbed into our respective “motels” and settled in for a more bitterly cold and windier night than the one before. The shelter of the rafters did little to protect us from the howling winds that circled us.  I was truly uncomfortable and wondering if this is where our trip was going to end. Are we really this far out of our element?","Black Gap Shelter
",Hickory Flats Cemetery,"Mar 21, Wed",8
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584706,"Sunrise couldn’t have come soon enough.  The Mayor’s knees were no better, we still had no cell service, the ranger had not yet called on us (830 am), it was still bitterly cold and what water I had was pretty much frozen and had blown off my loft during the night and busted (plastic too) on the concrete pad below.
As I was attempting start a fire to warm us while the Mayor was slowly packing up, a car pulled up to drop off two hikers and miraculously we were able to catch a ride (for $30) into town, not the nearest town I’m sure, but it is a town!  So now we’re holed up in the Best Western of Blairsville, GA until Friday morning when Mrs. Mayor, my sister, drives up back up from Florida to collect my hiking partner, and I return to the point on the trail where we left off.
Sorry Bob Hart, I wish this hadn’t happened and that you could continue to make this trip with me.  I know you’re truly disappointed after spending much of the last year researching equipment and the trail itself, not to mention the hours of training.  You’ll be missed.
FYI, a “Zero” is a day when no miles are recorded, a day off.","Hickory Flats Cemetery

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584945,"My intent was to return to the point in the trail from which I left but the fire service road to get there was impassible, I’m not sure how we did it the day before. Mike, my shuttle driver, mentioned that we must have come down a different way because the gate across that road was closed, locked and hadn't been opened for awhile as far as he knew. (could it have been a true miracle that got us off that mountain?). Anyway, Mike dropped me off at Three Forks, a point on the trail that I’d previously trekked; meaning I retraced 2.5 miles from earlier in the week but this time I took my time and a side trail to visit Long Creek Falls, see photo.
Around 2:00, I stopped for a snack and to change out my socks before assenting Sassafras Mountain (750 ft in 1 mile) my most challenging climb thus far. I was told that it will kick your butt, and it did but it’s a good warm up for what I’ll be seeing as I progress up the trail.  The decent brought me into Cooper’s Gap where I made the acquaintance of two young ladies, both recently retired from the Army, Spirit and Diamond. As I hiking along minding my own business, I heard rustling from the wooded hill above me to my right.  At first I didn't really see anything but all of a sudden two army solders in full combat gear complete with rifles jumped out and settled on the trail about 40' ahead of me.  As I stood there and looked at them, I saw several other soldiers moving down the hill. I casually passed the two without much of a comment and continued down to the gap where I met a few more military personnel in vehicles with food and water.  it turned out, the army was conducting Ranger training exercises in the hills surrounding the trail; their commander was kind enough to refill my water supply as Sassafras nearly drained it.  Note to self: water is priceless out here. (You can never have enough, but who wants to carry it?) 
I settled in at Gootch Gap Shelter for the night after an 11.5 mile day, it was nice to get some solid miles in after the unfortunate distraction of getting the Mayor out safely. 
Most of the day seemed like just a long hike...alone.  In addition to Spirit and Diamond, I met hikers along the way, many still without trail names, but no one that I knew and that made for a lonely day.","Three Forks 
",Gootch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 23, Fri",11.50
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585102,"I was the last one out of Gooch Mountain Shelter this morning. A slow steady drizzle seemed to keep several of us hanging around. Once the Shelter was cleared out, I hauled all my gear up there to pack it away more carefully. You can see by the photo that I solved my tent problem, at least temporarily.  This tent belongs to the Mayor, who obviously doesn't need it right now.  I sent my one person tent home via my sister for my bride to return to REI and to shop for a larger two man one.  While this is a real nice, light weight, compact tent, it is made by Z-pack and is pretty expensive.  if I damage it I'll have to replace it and still buy a tent for myself.  So why not save $600 and just get my own ASAP?  By the way, this is the first shelter sight I've seen with tent pads, very nice!  Everywhere else I've had to find the flattest ground without rocks and roots, clear the debris and pitch the tent.
Shortly after I departed, I received my first experience of trail magic at Gootch Gap.  A local Christian ministry sets up a tent and tables on the side of the trail and encourages hikers with hot food and drink, a smile and even a prayer if you so desire. By the time I arrived, the menu was changing over from eggs, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, coffee and juice to a fully stocked taco bar! This group has done this every weekend for 11 years.  Three plus (long) miles later coming off of Ramrock Mountain and into Woody Gap, I experienced another incidence of trail magic. This time a roaring campfire, hamburgers, hotdogs, veggie burgers (!) homemade biscuits, water, soda and even beer. This was a completely different group servicing hikers and again, every weekend.  This was my welcome into the Blood Mountain Wilderness and my approach to big Cedar Mountain. A pretty tough climb but incredible views from the top. My decent from Big Cedar Mountain was rather unremarkable because it was basically just walking through the woods, the trees were thick and the air was chilly.
I finished the day with 9.5 miles coming out and Henry Gap.  I hitched a ride into the town of Suches, GA, where I was collected by my college roommate and shuttled off to a nearby lodge to address some foot blister issues.  New boots are in my future.","Gooch Gap
",Henry Gap,"Mar 24, Sat",9.60
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585165,"I was forced to take another zero on Sunday due to foot problems. No blisters yet, except on the back of my heel, but the bottoms of my feet are getting really hot. So my roommate from college, who lives in Atlanta now, came to pick me up and took me down to REI in Alpharetta. Had a hard time finding boots that are going to replace the ones I had, but I got some and I’ll see how they work out. His daughter Jessie was able to join us for lunch so it turned out that he was my shuttle and she was my trail angel because she bought me lunch.
It was a rather short day going just over 7 miles, but the climb up and down Blood Mountain (the highest point in GA) was pretty tough, lots of rock ledges and the path itself is quite rocky.  The view from the top was spectacular.  A local day hiker that had been up there six times previously said it’s the first time he was ever able to see through the clouds. The photo in this entry is a stone shelter for hikers at the top of Blood Mountain. Needless to say it was quite windy and pretty cold.
Coming down off Blood Mountain I ended up at Neel Gap, also known as Mountain Crossing.  Mountain Crossing is a hostel and outfitter, hikers literally walk through it. This is where I’ll be spending the night, with 11 perfect strangers and Three Socks, a hiker I met on the first night camping.","Henry Gap
",Neel Gap,"Mar 26, Mon",7.25
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585226,"This number may be incorrect but it is said that between 2000 and 4000 people per year attempt a through hike of the Appalachian Trail.  At Neel Gap, roughly 25% drop out and that’s after nearly 35 miles.  I will say those are not 35 easy miles. This photograph shows shoes thrown into the trees that drape the entrance of Neel Gap. The shoes are donated by those hikers who decided not to pursue the trek any further.
The hostel life and Neel Gap was pretty cool, though I didn't sleep real well. Last night most people went to bed, but five of us stuck around in the main living area exchanging stories about hiking, our plans, our trail names are and how they originated. The rules of the hostel include no alcohol or drugs and everybody out by 9 AM.  Everybody was out and on the trail by 930 at the latest.
The day turned out to be one of the longest hikes for me so far at just over 12 miles and into Low Gap shelter. I immediately found some of the people from Neel Gap as I scouted a place to set up my tent. Once camp was established, I fixed dinner and found a place to hang my food bag to keep it out of the reach of any bear that might be roaming around after dark looking for a free meal. I also needed water, so I headed off to the water source to refill and filter my supply. Upon approaching the water source I passed the shelter and there I found several other people that I had met the night before participating in some of the restricted activities of Neel Gap. It was nice to be greeted with a course of “HEY LORAX” as I wandered into the shelter site. The family setting on the trail is really comforting, everybody’s friendly and everybody welcomes one another; it was like Lorax, do want to drink any of this or smoke any of that?  Being sober around people that are mostly always hungry can be a lot of fun, meaning the substance being consumed seems to have a faster and greater affect on them.  One such character who still hadn't received a trail name was a good example.  He kept trying to get me to smoke week with him and I simply wouldn't.  I won't say it was the weed, probably a combination of that an whiskey, but the guy mumbled a lot and didn't make much sense.  I finally asked him ""how many pots have you smoked?  You've taken too many of the marijuanas dude"". This for some reason shut him up other than asking me and others around us if I was for real.  But it was a fun exchange.
It’s odd that I have an easier time remembering trail names then I do people’s given names.  For instance, if I see someone on the trail and ask them have you seen “Joe” or have you seen “Linda”? They’ll likely reply, I don’t know. But if you say have you seen “Three Socks” or “No Pepsi”?  They’ll probably say yeah, this morning at this place or that.  Assigning a trail name is a lot of fun. You get to talk to the person, find out a little bit about them, and attach a name that best describes them in your opinion. I’ve been involved in several namings so far including that of “The Mayor” who is no longer with us, ""Tree Line"", a young lady from the Minnesota/Canadian border, ""Rainbow"" a young lady that wore a rainbow stripped hat, ""Cool Rock"" a guy that lost his phone, didn't find it but found a cool rock while looking for it.  now I didn't name him, but there was a guy at Low Gap that used the privy and forgot to take toilet paper with him, so he used a couple of dollar bills he had in his pocket.  He is now known as ""Dirty Money""","Neel Gap

Today’s ascent was long and gradual, roughly 1100 ft, but the terrain is what kept it from being only a stroll.  Several of the same hikers from the previous two nights settled into the Blue Mountain Shelter but this bubble is thinning and faster hikers are catching up.  Which means new characters and new stories.
Things also seem to be greening up a bit, especially on the forrest’s floor. If we could get some sun to balance out the dampness that hovers in the mountains, there should be quick increase in color.

My feet are really driving me nuts and I need to get off the trail to see what I can do about getting some inserts or something for my boots. Mountain Crossing, the same outfitter that is in Neel Gap, has a satellite store in Hiawassee. I stopped in there to get the inserts I needed. In addition, I was instructed on how to tie my boots properly so that my feet don’t move forward and back and my heels don’t lift up and down. It’s really uncomfortable but seem to work better.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586050,"Happy Good Friday.
The White Blaze lines the entire length of the Appalachian Trail, all 2200 miles of it. It’s painted mostly on trees but also appears on rocks, if there are no trees and even posts and stair steps if the trail crosses a road. It lets the hiker know they are still on the main trail and it’s on both sides of a tree because hikers are going in both directions. This morning I hadn’t seen a blaze for sometime so I stopped to look around to be certain that I was still on the path.  I didn’t see a blaze but within two feet of my face, at eye level, I saw the “blaze” (photographed) carved into the tree. I am on the right path, even if it's not on the Appalachian Trail.
It was a great day to hike, sunny and reasonably warm with 6 miles to Tray Mountain Shelter. The view from the top is incredible! The sunset was rich and colorful while the full moon that followed faded the pitch black sky full of stars. The shadows cast by the silhouette of the leafless trees was eerie and amplified by the hushed silence of the night. It’s exactly what I hoped I would find out here and what a way to begin the Easter Weekend!
Elevation for the day started at 2950 ft. and finished at 4330. I ascended 1720 ft. while descending 1000,  it the hike included two mountains, one 1100 ft. over 1 mile and the other 1400 ft. in 2 miles.","Unicoi Gap

That’s not to say there wasn’t a lot of uphill too, the day finished with a very challenging 800 foot ascent.  The weather was another perfect day with lots of sun and temps in the low to mid 60’s.  Many came into camp this evening with sunburns.
I’m managing to hike and camp with the same few people for awhile, June Bug, one year to the day older than me, she’s from Houston and Apple, whom I met on my first day.  Apple got his trail name by going down a mountain trail with an apple in his mouth the entire way and June Bug’s came from a name that her grandmother gave her years ago.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586053,"Easter Sunday. I woke up inspired at Deep Gap Shelter, mile marker number 65.4. The sun shone brightly and the 20 or so hikers that camped on the grounds were hustling about eager to get back on the trail. 
Knowing that I was probably going to make it a short day, I was in no hurry to get going. My hiking activity was all of 3 1/2 miles where I exited the trail at Dicks Creek gap. I walked down the highway a little more than half a mile where I would spend the night at the Top of Georgia Hostel and Hiking Center. Once assigned a bunk and settled into the bunkhouse, I requested one of the staff members that he shake down my backpack in an effort to eliminate some of the weight that I’ve been carrying. Hopefully this would alleviate some of the discomfort in my feet. After we went through everything in my pack it was determined that I could send home between 4-5 pounds, most of it was clothing and some items that I have yet to use on the trail.
That afternoon several guests were shuttled into the town of Hiawassee, where at the grocery store I assembled the most incredible tossed salad that I’ve ever had in my life!  It probably wasn’t the most incredible salad that I’ve had in my entire life, but it’s the first one I’ve had in over a week and it was really, really good! Once I finished my dinner, went grocery shopping to restock my food stores.  every single one of the other guests that were shuttled in, went shopping first and then ate dinner.  Everyone's heard that you don't shop on an empty stomach, we they did and bought a ton of food!  Actually, they all carried between 20-30 pounds of food back onto the trail with them.  Food stuffs that you would never carry out there; ham, a bunch of bananas, whole boxes of cereal, whole bags of apples and oranges, big bags of chips, cans of soda and beer...it went on and on.  And they all complained about it as soon as we started to get back into the shuttle to back to the hostel.  The next day the complaining was even worse.
 I finished the evening sitting on the porch of the hostel talking with and missing terribly, my wife Cathy, as I watched storm clouds rolling in over the distant mountains. Fortunately, I am staying in the bunkhouse tonight, out of the weather.","Deep Gap Shelter

I got maybe three or four hours of sleep after having gone to bed at 8:30. Not sure why, it was just a miserable night. But the speech that Bob, the owner of the hostel gives to his guests every morning at eight, was very inspiring and made us all excited to get back out there and attack the trail again.
Sadly, today was a zero, meaning I didn’t hike at all. (Doubly so because Michigan lost in the finals of the men’s NCAA basketball tourney).  These zeros are starting to bother me, I’ve now taken three because of my feet in 13 days.  But the day was not a waste. My college roommate Craig, (remember him?), drove nearly 120 miles up to see me and cart me around to pick up some supplies I needed including things to address my feet. Thank you again Craig!

After a 7 mile hike I ended up at a stealth campsite on a ridge with valley surrounding me on three sides.  The sun should be setting in about 15 to 20 minutes and I’ll have a really nice view as it sets behind the mountains that I probably climbed today.  It’s hard to tell. Rarely do I hike in a straight line it always seems to be around something or a switch back to make the climb “easier”.
According to the AWOL guidebook, I’m at mile marker 75.7, just shy of the North Carolina border by about 2 1/2 miles. (This mile marker does not include the 8.8 miles of the approach trail that I hiked with the Mayor on March 20 or the 2.5 that I retraced getting back on the trail after the Mayor left). I expect to cross the border tomorrow and do somewhere between 6 and 10 miles depending upon how I feel. My feet are still hurting and I’m looking forward to getting to Franklin, NC to visit an outfitter to see about new shoes.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened today. I didn’t see any hikers that I knew, they’re probably at least a day or two in front of me by now. I did meet other hikers but none are staying at this campsite, so I’m not getting to know anyone new.

Anyway, it was a real nice evening all by myself.  Though 2 hikers that I'd not met yet saw my tent and decided it would be best to settle in for the night.  A father and son, not yet named, from the Cincinnati area set up a single 4 man tent on the approach trail to my ridge.  by the time they arrived, I had finished my dinner, washed up and found a secure branch for my food bag.  By the time these guys were done eating it was getting dark and they had a terrible time of hanging their food.  The weighted rope used to hang ones food, got stuck in a tree a good 15 feet off the ground.  I offered help, though there wasn't much I could do, including offering my branch and rope, but they declined so I sat quietly watching as they found the longest two sticks they could and taped them together using duct tape. It was really quite comical and they knew it but they succeeded after about 20 minutes or so and got their food secured in the tree.  I told the younger guy that based on what I saw last night, I wanted to name him Duct Tape.  He smiled and declined, hoping something better will come along.
Around 930 or so it started to rain but only lasted for about half an hour. It was so loud against the tent, it sounded like dozens of drummers all beating on my tent with drum sticks and it kept me awake.  But those showers made way for the incredible thunder, lightning, rain and monsoon type winds that showed up from 230-5 this morning. Never have I been so close to that much power with nowhere to go for protection. Plus I was a good 100 feet off the trail.  It continued to rain most of the early morning, which meant I broke camp in the rain, packed up a wet tent and headed off for the day's fun.
After a nice gradual climb over 2 miles, I crossed into North Carolina! (See photo) this was really exciting and gave me a real sense of accomplishing something out here. I thought about only doing 5 miles today but instead went on and did 10.  Which I’m glad I did, making Franklin, NC that much closer.
Right now I’m settled into the familiar three sided shelter at Standing Indian Mountain. Temps are expected to get below 25 tonight with clear skies and winds up to 20-25 mph. I’m bundled in pretty good with any electronics and my water filter in my sleeping bag with me to keep them warm.

Mary is a pediatric ER doctor in SE Tennessee, training to be a Chaplin and she spends one week a month hiking a 20 mile section of the trail in NC. She camps, interacts and administers foot care to hikers. Treating blisters, massaging feet and “anointing” them with lavender oil.  She was all packed up and ready to go this morning when I found out what she was doing out there. She did offer to address my foot issues, but like I said, she was all packed up.  Looking back, I wish I would have...what an incredible service!
Today’s 8 mile hike was highlighted by a view from the top of Standing Indian Mountain. Again, just a beautiful view at over 5400 ft. Though the views are always subject to the weather and often look the same as the last mountain, I can’t get tired of them. It’s just hard climbing the mountains to get the opportunity to see them.
I’m sleeping in the shelter tonight. Because of the possibility of heavy rains. Even if it’s not raining in the morning when I break camp, everything is wet and heavier.  But there are two guys here with me both busting +20 mile days.  “My Way” is 65 and has done 1100 miles of the trail 3 times.  He was named by his wife because that’s the way he is.  “Forgiven” is 20 and a real joy to talk with.  I got the feeling that he couldn’t wait to be my age to see what sort of impact he’ll have had on people’s lives, especially his own family when he has one.  He told us that he received his name from God, that seemed to turn ""My Way"" off in a hurry.  Because I’m so much slower than these guys, I’ll likely not see them again.
Today’s hike was the first to take me over 5000 ft. It was a pretty tough climb as most are anymore as the terrain seems to be getting rockier and the altitudes are increasing.  An experienced section hiker told me that this is good practice for farther north.
The starting elevation was 4750 ft. ending at 4528 while ascending 1091 ft. and descending 1275. The Standing Indian Mountain climb was from 4750 ft. to 5435 over 1.5 miles.","Standing Indian Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586058,"I’ve been by myself for the last few days which is kind of refreshing in a sense, but also kind lonely, no offense Mayor.  Today, I passed no hikers and only a couple passed me.  However, about a mile or so before I was finished this afternoon, I spotted a guy from about 200 yards away. He wore jeans, a black jacket and tennis shoes. His hair was combed down over his forehead until it reached his Blues Brothers’ style RayBans and he was just leaning against a tree with his hands slightly in his front pants pocket, he was way out of place and I have no idea what he was doing in in the woods dressed like that an no hiking equipment of bags of any sort.  As I approached, he made no movement at all until I commented ""if you were a musician, this would be a great album cover"". This made him turn his head toward me and flash a big smile of shiny braces. I passed with a fist bump and turned back after a bit for one last look to make sure he was still there and confirm this encounter. He was.
It was another nice day for hiking, at least it started out that way.  The first 4 miles I was making very good time.  I was passed by ""Mike the Moose"" of Scottsdale, AZ, originally from Jackson, MI (still a Sparty).  ""Moose"" hit the trail on Easter Sunday and had covered as much ground as I have in three weeks.  He’s targeting 100 days to complete the trail...another 20+ mile per day hiker.
Once Moose an I separated, the weather started to turn colder and wetter and the wet has not stopped as of this evening.  It wasn’t a downpour, but a nagging drizzle that kept everything wet and slippery.  By five miles into the day, I reached Mooney Gap which is the beginning of the steepest, rockiest climb yet, Albert Mountain. It was an impressive section that took me about 35 minutes to go only .25 miles.  There were two points at which I threw my trekking poles up over a bunch of huge rocks on the trail and climbed on my hands, feet and knees.  Embarrassingly, after the first time I did that, I collected my poles, had a drink of water and saw the actual trail come out from behind another bunch of rocks. That would have been so much easier! But there was NO trail going around the second bunch of huge rocks so climbing them was the only way.
At the top of Albert Mountain is a fire tower that we’re encouraged to climb.  Like I need to climb 4 flights of stairs, but I’m glad I did.  And though overcast and rainy, the platform provided a 270, maybe 273 degree view of a whole bunch of mountains, at least 40 and I think I climbed every single one of them.
Shortly after coming off the tower, I officially passed the 100 mile mark of the AT and someone was kind enough to scratch it into the earth. (see the above photo taken from a nearby helicopter that I hired for this momentous occasion.)  
So now I’m settled into the lower level at Long Branch Shelter with three others: ""Lucky"", sleeping in his hammock in the rain, ""Thunder Chicken"", sleeping upstairs in the shelter and ""Raskolinkov"", who set his hammock up inside the shelter.  This was a really nice group and we enjoyed the conversation until bedtime at 730.","Carter Gap Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586059,"Woke up to the rain again today, and for most of the night the rhythm on the steel roof of the shelter kept me from a real good sleep. But the constant chill that I’ve experienced ever since I started doing this was finally gone...until I put on yesterday’s wet clothes. I fixed breakfast and hit the trail.  Because of all the rain we've been getting, the trails are flowing like a stream.  Sometimes the water is 2 inches deep and I’m walking from rock to rock to try and keep my feet from getting wetter...but how could they?  I looked around for the white blazes just to make sure I was on the trail and not walking in a stream or river)
My goal this morning was to get to Winding Stairs Gap and catch a ride into Franklin, NC to see about new shoes.  A young man from Binghamton University in NY was on spring break with some friends hiking, was going into Franklin and offered me a ride.  He dropped me off at Baltimore Jack’s Hostel, where I reserved  a bunk two days ago. I paid my $20 and went to Bunk House #2 as assigned.  It was full and even the couch was rented out, that's where I met ""Orion"", he also reserved a bunk but got the couch.  I returned to the office and pointed this out to the “helpful” counter clerk, he gave me a puzzled look and returned my $20 without query or comment.  I replied, that’s it? No bed? No customer service?  Can you at least point me in another direction?  He simply said, “what do you want me to do?”  So I left, made another call and am comfortably settled into Gooder Groove Hostel, still in Franklin.  The place is clean and ""Zen"", along with his staff, “Dead Pan” and “Everywhere” are very accommodating.
According to the log book, I just missed ""Apple"" by a day but I did run into ""Forgiven"".  He and I enjoyed a Chinese buffet tonight, a decision I feel that I’m going to regret within the next few hours.","Long Branch Shelter

Later in the day my old buddy Craig showed up so we we had lunch and went to a movie, Paul the Apostle, his treat.
This morning after a failed attempt at a few hikers breakfast at the same church, we made our way in to the target of the weekend, Outfitters 76 for new shoes. Score! I picked up some La Sportiva trail runners, these are a lot more comfortable than the boots and weigh probably half as much. So I was pretty excited, though I didn’t feel much like beginning my hiking day at 230 in the afternoon.
I left the 65 degree sun filled streets of Franklin and headed for the 50 degree cloud/mist covered mountain I left on Saturday. I targeted Silar Mountain Shelter just 6 miles in. It was a brisk uphill hike and I landed at the campsite in just under 3 hours. The shoes felt pretty good. The hot spots were greatly reduced and just slightly irritated from continued use, the day off worked wonders. Let’s see what happens with tomorrow’s hike.
It just after midnight and I’m having trouble sleeping, so I stepped out of my tent to have a look around. Finally (!) the sky was black and completely filled with stars.  There must be dozens of them out tonight. The only interruption of the stars and the perfect pitch black of the sky, were the distant lights down below the mountain of the town of Franklin some 15 miles away.","Winding Stair Gap

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586554,"The second day with my new shoes, 7.75 miles with a pretty decent climb and a more challenging descent.  They seem a little tight in the toes but I think that can be worked out with sock thickness and inserts. But no blisters and no new hot spots.
My day was highlighted during a break after an exhaustive climb. I met a Vietnamese man named “Half Slow”. He was section hiking with a couple from Ireland, “M&M”.  We met where the trail emptied into a fire service road, I was going north and they south. We hydrated, exchanged names and brief stories. Once I told him my name and explained the origin, he began to recite the poem “Trees” by Joyce Kilmer. His delivery was very slow and deliberate as kept his eyes closed as he struggled slightly to recall the verse. We all stood quietly as though in prayer.  I hiked another half day and thought about how out of the ordinary this was for me and meaningful it was. 
I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the sweet Earth’s flowing breast;
A tree that looks a God all day 
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain. 
Poems are made by fools like me
But only God can make a tree.","Siler Bald Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586555,"A big day with my new shoes and I was encouraged!  Eleven miles and some pretty serious climbs; if the Mayor’s knees weren’t already shot, today’s descent would have blown them to pieces...1,000 ft in 1.5 miles, and tomorrow is going to be even worse!
I ran into the Half Slow again today and chatted for about 10 minutes or so; he granted me permission to share a bit of his story.  Again he was heading south, alone this time, while I’m heading north.  Yesterday he was unfamiliar with “The Lorax” but today he seemed to know more about the story. He recognized me from a distance and shouted out a greeting as soon as I saw him.  Everything about him is encouraging, his pace, his energy and especially his conversation. Not just with me, but with others he’s met on the trail.
Half Slow got his name while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).  It was his first long distance hike and he could only go 5 miles per day for several days, then added another then another and before long was at 10 miles.  Someone commented on his progress and he responded that he is so slow. That someone came back with, no, you’re Half Slow.
Half Slow lives in San Fransisco.  Small in stature, he is a Vietnam refugee whom along with his brother and sister, came to the US when he was 16 years old in 1975 at the “close” of the Vietnam war.  Sadly, his parents did not survive the war.  Half Slow met his wife, another refugee of the war, here in the US and by all indications, has lived a very happy and successful life.  His favorite holiday is Thanksgiving and each year he celebrates the kindness of the American people and the opportunities he has been afforded.  Half Slow is 65 and has knee and back issues though you wouldn’t know it by watching him hike. He is “section, thru-hiking” which means he is dropping his RV off at a Gap and hiking to the next Gap where he has arranged transportation back to his ride.  As he hikes with only water and perhaps snacks, he greets and encourages the hikers he passes all the while picking up trash that some of us litter along the way.
God bless you Half Slow, I look forward to running into you along the  trail many times between here and Maine.","Wayah Bald Shelter

The views are spectacular on a day like today, as you stand on a rocky cliff you can see for miles in every direction...except for down, you can only see for hundreds of feet.
I landed at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) somewhere in NC.  The NOC has a couple of restaurants, rafting, kayaking and several bunkhouses, one of which is housing me tonight. It was nice to sit in chairs, soak my feet in a river, take a hot and really long shower, do laundry and have a nice meal that I didn’t cook with newly made friends.  Of course there are some that use this contact with civilization to consume as much beer as possible before fading into the darkness of the woods with as much beer as they can carry.
I hope to receive a package from home tomorrow with a reload of food and other supplies before heading back onto the trail myself.  Hikers out of the NOC will be greeted with a nearly 4000 foot climb over 7 miles to the first official campsite.
One more bit on Half Slow.  There is a father and son team of hikers that are running in my bubble. The son has yet to take a trail name but the father is known as Backfire, due to his recurring flatulence.  Upon hearing the origin of this name, Half Slow imparted what we thought would be ancient Vietnamese wisdom. Half Slow bowed and shook his head saying...”Everyday we may hurt and nobody sees  our tears. Everyday we may feel joy and nobody sees our smile.  But when we fart, everybody knows.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Today’s hike was straight up hill all the way. Seven miles, 3000 ft. It was the hottest day yet, upper 70’s with a slight breeze once we got up in elevation.  Many were unprepared as far as water goes. I started with 2.5 liters and ended up donating 1/2 liter to one such woman.  Fortunately 4 miles in we found a pretty cool source seeping through some rocks. Before long there were a dozen people reloading. This will serve as a good lesson for the future.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586887,"Two hard days in a row. And that’s not just me whining about it, it’s pretty much everybody that I’ve spoken with who have made the climbs.  Even the people that are putting in 15-20 mile days are cutting their daily mileage back some.  Today I put in a little over 10 if I were to count the distance to a remote water source, which I’m not.
Today’s hike included the descent of yesterday’s mountain that took (me) about 8 hours over two days to climb. And of course once I got down I had to turn right around and climb another one. After the initial 300 incline out of a gap, the trail seemed to flatten out a bit and I thought just maybe the people that laid out the NC portion of the AT were satisfied letting me walk along side, half way up a mountain instead of making climb every single one of them. Nope, up I went, 800 ft in half a mile and finally settled into a cozy little camp ground on the other side. I’ve chosen to sleep in the shelter tonight as storms are expected over the next few days turning to snow by Monday.  The thunder is rolling in the distance now.
My goal for tomorrow is Fontana Dam just over 12 miles from here.  The dam is the Southern boundary for the Smoky Mountains National Park.  Getting there would be nice but I developed a heel blister on my right foot and want to make sure I don’t lose control of that, so 6 miles up the trail is another shelter I can camp at if I don’t think I can do 12.

I took off at 930 and made my 6 miles to the next shelter by 1215, I had plenty of daylight left so I had lunch before moving on. By the time I finished lunch it began to rain again but off I went. The shelter where I dined is in a gap, meaning a low spot, between mountains. While climbing the next mountain, it stopped raining as I ascended above and circled around the clouds and shelter. I could see the wind push those clouds up out of that gap and parallel to my trail; eventually over my head so that I was again walking in the rain. Watching the clouds and predicting the precipitation pattern is pretty cool when above and right inside the clouds themselves. Inside the clouds it’s not really raining it’s like walking through what seems like a bath of soaking wet air. So the entire afternoon, I was wet. Not only wet but beyond saturated. And the temps were falling rather quickly.  I was wearing shorts and my rain coat overs a tee shirt that was drenched from sweat. I completed the last 6 miles at 530pm and finished at the Fontana Marina. A shuttle eventually picked me up and took me to the Fontana Village Resort; this would be home for the next 36 hours.
It’s a shame it rained so much, there were so many things to take photos of. Streams were bursting over rocks and trees, even over the trail in spots and the shades of green on the floor of the forest were wide and brilliant; probably even more so in the bright sunshine.  
For now I warm and dry. I had a nice salad and a couple of freshly caught lake trout tacos with people I’ve met on the trail. Everybody’s in good spirits preparing for a day off or in some cases, another day off while we wait out the expected snow in the mountains.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

One of my hiking friends, The Punisher and I headed off to do this short hike which should have taken 1-1.5 hours, but we got caught up with the function and history of the Fontana Dam, the effect on the local economies and how the waterways service the entire Smoky Mountain region as well as the Ohio Valley and all along the Mississippi River from one end to the other.

After a mile or so I hit the snow line with just over 1.5” of snow on the ground. The hiked traffic on the new snow plus all the rain we got the day before, made for very sloppy conditions on the trail; mud 5” deep in some places, but plenty of mud everywhere else.
Three miles up was the Shuckstack fire tower, quite a view in all directions. The tower is about 70’ tall, built in the 1930’s and did nothing to block out the 40 mph winds. Ice was melting and blowing off the metal frame in chunks.  My wife would never have made it to the top of this thing, I was uncomfortable!
I settled in for the night at Mollie’s Ridge Shelter for the night, along with 50 other campers and 15 people sleeping in the stone shelter.

Plus I got to hike with some people that I’ve been with for sometime now but in the end, they were more energetic than I, so they moved on and I settled for 6.25 miles.
In staying here I’ve met a new group of people, though mostly kids. Seven, got her name because she’s on her 7th pair of shoes. Polar Bear, got his name because he cowboy camped (under the stars without a tent) and woke up in 2” of snow. Teflon, has had several Trail names but none have stuck and Dirty Money, whom I may have mentioned before. Dirty Money got his name because he thought the privy‘s were supplied with toilet paper; they’re not and he ended up using a dollar bill. These “kids” have the ability to move fast but for some reason they don’t.  And that’s ok, I enjoy their company and apparently they enjoy mine.
The trail was all uphill which is the primary reason I made it a short day. But there are plenty of views to take in along the way.
The shelters in the Smoky Mountains National Park are still three sided but all have a fireplace and if dry wood can be found, are oh so welcome though not completely efficient.  The photo above shows a tarp hanging along the open side of the shelter, this does little but keep out the elements of rain and snow...wind and cold can still get in.  In the park, it is required that hikers stay inside the shelter due to bear activity.

When I came out a couple of minutes later, the entire campsite was enveloped in fog; thick, dense fog. My immediate thought was, “how long was I in there?” But as I approached the shelter from the south, two good size white tail deer approached on the same trail from the north. They were strolling as though they do this everyday.  Not concerned with me in the lease, they headed off toward what will soon be the sun rise.
By the time I hit the trail at 9, the sun was out and it was shaping up to be a good day to hike. I was hoping to do 12 miles and catch up with my trail family (tramily).  As I circled around a ridge to the east, it started to get cloudy and the wind began to kick up.  I dress such that I can remove layers if I get too warm. Today was long pants, tee shirt, long underwater top and rain jacket.  I was warm and beginning to work up a sweat but the temperature was dropping and the winds continued to increase in velocity.  The wind and clouds blowing over the trail ridges were eventually quite fridged. At one high point on the trail I looked behind me to find the treetops along the trail I had just walked were covered in frost.
I only went 6.26 miles today. Though it didn’t rain, I was soaked with persperation and the driving winds made my day absolutely miserable. When I got to the shelter there was room for one more person, ME!  I somehow changed into my dry camp clothes but could not warm up; I even climbed into my sleeping bag for half an hour and that helped a bit. For dinner I managed only some ramen noodles, it was just too cold to stand outside and cook but the warm soup sure felt good.
It’s supposed to be below freezing tonight with strong winds all night. The shelters in NC have fireplaces built into them and someone managed to build a fire that warmed us up some but once we go to bed and the fires dies, I’m certain I’ll get chilled again and trying to sleep while cold is nearly impossible.

It woke all of us up and scared the day lights out of me and certainly the person on either side of me. There was no explanation and we were left to wonder what was happening. Of course I then needed to go outside to relieve myself...in the cold, in the wind and with the mystery of whatever might have attacked her might still be outside. When I came back around the corner of the building to re-enter, there were three other people outside that had to do exactly what I was doing and talking about what the heck just happened?!  The screaming event repeated itself an hour later.
Everybody slept poorly last night and nobody really knows what happened.
Today was an absolute perfect day to hike, temps were in the low fifties and the winds were calm. I wish it were like this yesterday. I did 7.5 miles today and passed up some young people with whom I’ve been hiking with the last few days and stayed at a shelter further up the trail. Ideally, it would have been nice to get to Clingman’s Dome today (the highest elevation on the AT at 6658 ft) but the three mile approach trail to this summit is steep and pretty challenging.  I knew many of the hikers at the final shelter before the approach, so I settled in with them for the night.","Derrick Knob Shelter

The approach trail to Clingman’s Dome was three miles as I mentioned, it was steep but the views were worth it.  I eventually moved into an area that is dominated with spruce evergreen trees, both dead and alive. The smells were intoxicating and the colors against the clear blue sky or the glow of the green moss on the fallen trees in the shadows of the living were unreal. The clearings were breathtaking and I couldn’t wait to get up top and take it all in from the observation deck.  Once on deck, I rejoined a couple I’ve camped with off and on over the last several days, Moon Pie and Train Wreck.  The skies were so clear we could see all the way back to Springer Mountain, the point at which we began one month ago. It was rather funny and sad at the same time to watch tourists struggle to climb the ramp to the top of the observation deck; a lot of panting and sweating.  This was the easiest walk of my month.
We walked .5 miles on a paved walk way to the visitors center to purchase some water and on the return, several tourists were lined up on the side of the walk way taking pictures of a black bear moving about in the bushes down below. So I saw a bear!
After lunch and the bear siting we returned to the trail for an additional 5 miles to tonight’s shelter.  There are probably 50 people here with tents scattered throughout the spruce forest; the different color tents add an interesting usual dimension.

Hopefully these people take proper care in the handling of trash and the hanging of food bags.  Last night I pitched my tent on the perfect flat spot but was within 50 feet of the bear cables; I’ve seen people camp closer than that before. At 2am I was aroused by some scratching and snorting under the cables and the sound came within a few feet of my tent. This made me a bit nervous and the “moving on” of the source of that sound became my prayer.  That noise continued to move around the area for a good hour. Every time I thought my prayer was answered, I heard the noise again moving my way.  I’m thinking bear, raccoon and hoping for a deer. Finally at 310am, I heard a zipper from a nearby tent followed by the squeaking of the pully from the bear cables and the source of my fear disappeared.  In the morning without causing alarm, I spoke with a number of people about the sound. Those that heard it couldn’t identify it either.  So I guess I’ll never know. I do know that camping near a bear cable is not a good idea.
I, along with Moon Pie and Train Wreck, left camp at 830 this morning heading for Newfound Gap, 6 miles away. This is where Cathy and I first put foot on the AT while on vacation in 2016 and it’s how I got the brilliant idea to make this hike.  We reached the gap in plenty of time to meet a Trail angel that Moon Pie knew through an Women’s AT hiking organization. We were greeted with fruit, homemade cookies and muffins and given a 15 mile ride into the heartbeat of AT cities, Gatlinburg, TN. We’ll use the time in town to shower, launder, resupply and relax a bit before returning to the trail on Tuesday morning. Good timing too...cold temps, heavy rains and winds gusting to 60 mph in the mountains are expected.
Good news on the feet front, they’re feeling pretty good these days. My new shoes now have 100 miles on them and I’ve no real problems other than slightly irritated heels.  I should have better awareness of that within the next week as I work my way through the remainder of the Smoky’s.","Mt.

It was incredible in every direction and an app that I purchased called “ Peak Finder” could identify the mountaintops as far as I could see.  Springer Mountain, looked and felt a long way away but was only 75 miles...so why did I walk 200 miles to get there?
As I approached Clingman’s Dome, the vegetation in the forest began to change.  The hardwood trees were becoming fewer and the Spruce and Frazier Fur evergreens were becoming more abundant.  My senses came alive at the sudden change in color, brightness, quiet and smells of the forest; I was reminded of walking the needle covered trails of northern Michigan and it seemed to motivate me more to make this climb.  This type of forest lasted for several days/miles. It’s reported that due to high winds and very low temperatures in this part of the park, the evergreen is really the only tree that can survive.  And they grow impressively tall, straight and wide.  Some of the root systems of fallen trees are greater than 20” across and the moss is so thick and plush, it feels like a damp carpet.  Very little light gets in but plenty of fog does. That, along with the glowing moss and the dead silence, creates a very eerie setting. But quite beautiful at the same time.","

I dressed this morning and my clothes were clean and smelled so fresh after a day off for laundry and stuff. Within hours I was hiking in the cold rain again only this time there was no hard driving wind like there usually is up here in the Smoky’s.  There were plenty of clouds to block out what my guide book says are some incredible views worthy of photos and certainly worthy of wonder.
Today I managed 11.25 miles in the steady rain and tonight I’m in the shelter so I don’t have to da with a wet tent in the morning. There is also no fire in the shelter tonight because all the wood in the Smoky Mountains is wet. ALL OF IT!  Which basically means that everybody’s wet clothing will be wet in the morning and there is nothing worse than putting on cold wet clothes from yesterday and hiking all day in another rainstorm. Yes, it’s going to rain again tomorrow too. In fact, rain in the forecast for the rest of the week.
More news from the middle of the night creature encounter from this last weekend...my friend Brad Googled black bear sounds and they matched what I heard. I also reported the incident to an AT ridge runner and she confirmed the sound as a bear just passing through doing bear stuff.","Newfound Gap

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588649,"Today’s rain was a continuation of yesterday’s and last night’s, it has not let up!  
I’m in a shelter again tonight with pretty much the same group as last night. We went just over 5 miles to make it here on trails that flowed with 2-3” of water in some places. The next Shelter is another 8 miles up the trail and will likely have as many as 30 people vying for a spot given that that’s how many were at this shelter last night.  It’s 3 in the afternoon and everybody is tucked into their sleeping bags trying to get warm.  
Although it’s easy to complain about the weather, it is what it’s supposed to be and who am I to judge it “bad”?  But I can say it’s uncomfortable, REALLY uncomfortable.  The attached photo was taken from a ridge that is supposed to be a spectacular view, and I’m sure it is. Whatever is out there.","Peck’s Corner Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588650,"What day is it?  Oh, it’s Rainday (again) and tomorrow is the day after Rainday (again).  This has to stop, I mean it always has in the past!  I’ve been in the rain for four straight days and it’s been raining for six.  Even brushing my teeth makes me cold because I have to do it outside, in the rain and then finish packing and get ready to go or get in bed. The last thing I want you, the reader to think is that I’m complaining. I’m not, so I apologize if it’s coming across that way. I want to paint you a picture of what all of us hikers put up with everyday in one way or another. So please bear with me...
Our goal is to get to 2,190 miles north, to Mt. Katahdin in the Baxter State Park in Maine before it closes in mid-October due to potential winter weather. Many of these hikers are fast and should get there in plenty of time but many are fighting injuries of some sort that naturally slow one down.  WE ALL face the trail, the elements and must protect ourselves AND the environment against ourselves and the environment.  One of the most annoying and time consuming tasks for me is to find a tree that 20 others haven’t already claimed, throw a rope over a branch 15” up and each night hang all food stuffs and “smellables” from that branch to protect both us and wildlife from an encounter. Several times already I’ve forgotten about a protein bar in the pocket of my backpack and had to go outside, lower my bag, put the bar inside and raise it back up. Some will tell you not to bother, bear are afraid of people and won’t bother us; they’ve even slept with their food bags in their tents.  FYI, if a bear gets to ones food supply, the bear may associate people with food and come around people more often, increasing the likeliness of an actual encounter. This bear will usually be captured and put down rather than relocating it, since no matter where it’s living, it will still associate people with food.  Save the wildlife, hang your food.
There are water sources located along the trail and at most every shelter site so far.  Hopefully there will be plenty of precipitation to keep the sources supplied throughout the summer. Water needs to be collected and filtered daily for cooking and tooting on the daily hike.  This is all easy enough so far, but it’s often spring water or snow melt and it’s cold, even colder on already cold hands.
Then there’s privy life. Privies (or is it privi?) are a step down from the fiberglass port-a-potty that we’ve all used and embrace. Pardon the graphic nature of this paragraph, but picture a toilet seat on a wooden platform 5-8’ over a pit of fenced in waste.  The toilet seat is wet and cold and the user is protected by a sloped roof and a 3’ tall wall most of the way around the toilet; sometimes there’s a door. The wind comes from every direction...and I mean EVERY direction. (Often the craftsmanship of these structures remind me of the skills possessed by the 5-7 year olds at Home Depot on a Saturday morning).  Privy’s are located 50-75 yards away from the shelter either up or down a sometimes muddy trail.  You might make your way to the privy in the middle of the night with a headlamp on your forehead, a plastic bag of toilet paper in hand and every once in a while clapping your hands to scare off an animal that may be out on his midnight rounds. Once done, hurry back to the shelter, maybe get out of rain clothes and wet hiking shoes, sanitize your freezing hands with alcohol get back into your dry sleep clothes and try to get warm again in your sleeping bag.  Could it get worse?  Imagine you’re in Tennessee where the shelters have no privies.  Now repeat all steps from the previously described going to and from the privy, but now you’ll need to carry a small shovel of some sort, affectionately called a “deuce scoop” (figure it out), dig a 6” hole, do your business and burry it.  In this case there is no protection at all from the elements or other hikers with similar needs and you’re in a field designated as “toilet area” where thousands of previous hikers for decades have used their “duece scoops”.  Here’s a thought...the dog days of summer when those privies begin to simmer.
So I believe I was talking about rain.  It’s supposed to rain through the night and quit at my current location by 1:00 tomorrow afternoon. The good news is that it’s supposed to stop by 10:00 tomorrow morning at lower elevations and my destination of Davenport Shelter.  So tomorrow could be my last rainy day for a week or so and by the weekend, I’ll be out of the Smoky’s.","Tri-Corner Shelter 
",Cosby Knob Shelter ,"Apr 26, Thu",7.70
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588651,"Rumors and news travel up and down the trail at the speeds of the slowest and fastest hikers.  Today I heard that at one point during the week, access to the AT in the Smoky’s was closed due to all the rain.  There were even reports of mudslides. Those of us already on the trail just kept moving along, blissfully ignorant.
I woke up this morning to the same old noise, rain on the tin roof of the shelter, but at least it’s a bit warmer.  The forecast called for the rain to end today, around 1:00 this afternoon at the elevation where I awoke and 10:00 am down lower. I went lower.  
It was still a trying hike as the run off of the rain continued to flood the trail making it like walking in a moving stream and the fog was still thick. Again, many of the promised views were obstructed by fog.  Further, I stepped on a root in the trail, as I often do, slipped and face planted in a big pile of wet moss and dirt. I was so fortunate that there was no big rock or tree or root there that line so much of the trail.
Well finally as I strolled downhill to Mt. Cammerer, the sun came out! And by 11:30 Moon Pie and dropped our packs at an amazing overlook and took the sun, the view and a snack!  It was a great break and made the rest of the days hike much more enjoyable.  It should be noted that that the trail conditions didn’t really improve and I left my rain cover on my pack just in case.
I pulled into Davenport Shelter around 1:30. This shelter had a fence from ground to ceiling across the the open side of the structure. Of course there was a gate that could be latched and even locked if someone had an evil thought...someone other than me.  Apparently all shelters had these fences at one time but people would lock themselves in and leave food outside to attract bear and snap close up pictures. Why this one still has the fence, I’m not sure.
Finally, tonight the same Trail angel that picked us up at Newfound Gap and carted us around six days ago, hiked just over a mile uphill with a girlfriend, to bring those of us staying at the shelter that night, trail magic!  They prepared hamburgers, veggie burgers, two HUGE tossed salads, fruit, chips, deserts, soft drinks, beers and condiments. In all, 14 people were fed at the expense of these kind ladies and then they carried all the trash out for us.  Normally Trail magic occurs only where the trail may cross a road, like in a Gap. But in all my weeks of long distance hiking, I’ve never seen the magic come to a shelter.  
We all retired satisfied that night. And as we’re about to exit the Smoky Mountains tomorrow morning, no one could have asked for a more perfect way to end the wettest, coldest, most difficult hiking weeks ever.  And that’s not just my opinion, but that of everyone that spent the last several days on this trail.
God bless trail angels.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588652,"I’m finally out of the Smoky Mountains National Park, though technically still in the Smoky’s.
Four miles brought me to a popular hostel known as Standing Bear Farm. There’s a bunkhouse, a tree house and a couple of cottages. I chose to share a cottage with a gent from Australia whom I met previously named All Good. It seems that has been his term of choice, hence, his name.  My plan is to stay over night, do laundry, dry out and post new journals to satisfy my dozens of fans.  Too bad, there is no internet here so posting will have to wait until Hot Springs, NC.
Standing Bear is a great idea. Along with the previously mentioned amenities, they offer a kitchen, a small store, showers and laundry; though it requires a washboard. It’s set well off the beaten path on a lovely stream and while there are plenty of people about, it has a “stereotypical” deep south feeling about it that includes strong southern accents, a big four wheel drive truck on jacks right out by the front drive a broken down washing machine/flower pot and the remnants of a still.  There’s even talk amoungst the guests of a nearby moonshiner and a feral child that runs the property.  Beer flows freely for a price from 8am to 9pm and the smell of “alternate tobacco” is present from time to time as well.  With all that said, the staff is very accommodating and offers willing hikers “Work for stay” opportunities and several young people I’ve met have taken advantage of it.  My clothes are clean, though I still smell, I’m comfortable in my bed and ready for a good night sleep.
BTW, my hiking crew are comfortable in a real house somewhere eating real food, doing laundry the modern way, sleeping in the beds of the children who live in that house.  We will reconnect on the trail tomorrow.","Davenport Gap Shelter 
",Standing Bear Farm,"Apr 28, Sat",3.80
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588941,"I was and ready to go by 830 but for some reason I waited around until 1030.  I sat out by the fire pit and talked with some of the people that were too drunk to deal with the night before.  But a couple were well on their way to another drunken day by the time I left.  That’s sad, to me anyway but everybody is out here to hike their own hike.  A handful of these guys have been here for 3 or 4 days doing the same thing.
So today was the first full day out of the Smoky Mountains Park and it welcomed me with a 2,500’ climb right out of the gate. I’m not sure where the Smokys technically end, but being out of the park basically means that we hikers are no longer required to first fill up the shelters and can pitch our tents at stealth sites along the trail. On the way I was greeted by two good ol’ boys doling out Trail magic at the top of Snowbird Mountain.  While this is always welcome, it sometimes takes the wind out of my sails for hiking... I’m like a baby and get distracted too easily.  But i got back on track and went on to the Groundhog Shelter since that’s where I agreed to meet up with my crew again.  I arrived several hours before they did so was already settled into my site and preparing dinner. There were also a few new people on hand that lended some nice conversation...”Decade”, a lawyer from NJ and his partner “Rogue” a CPA from Seattle.  Three years ago Decade said he would do a thru hike in 10 years and Rogue has black hair with a white stripe right in front like Rogue from the X-Men. “Wayward” made it through the Smoky’s in three days, he’s a marathoner in real life and “No Chill” just another youngster that eats junk, moves fast and is enjoying his time out here.
The moon is full tonight, or nearly and the woodland creatures are out making some pretty loud racket, especially the owls that have scared the daylights out of me from a tree above my tent.  But I also think I hear lunatic hikers out there hiking by the moonlight and headlamps doing their own bit of howling.","Standing Bear Farm

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588945,"Today I landed at the summit of Max Patch Bald, just over 4,600’ up.  A “bald” is a mountain top cleared of trees and such and was intended for cattle grazing years ago.  The Bald is now a popular place for hikers to camp and locals to come and watch the sun rise and set.  When I arrived, hikers were told about a portion of the trail 14 miles ahead closed due to a fire at or near one of the shelters.  A few hikers went on tonight, some hitched rides into Hot Springs with locals after the sunset, but most pitched camp and enjoyed the displays of creation with a sunset and moonrise on absolutely cloudless night.  The temps are expected to dip a bit and the wind kicked up as well when the sun retired.  Right now, the moon is so bright it’s like sleeping in a lit parking lot.
Back to the fire, information is sketchy due to the lack of internet and phone signals. But every once in a while some will get through. But at this stage, it’s bad.  I will say that there was no sign of smoke or fire glowing on the adjacent mountain sides tonight, so that’s good. There are probably 70 campers on the Bald for the night with NO fires, as no fires are permitted.","Groundhog Creek Shelter 
",Max Patch Bald,"Apr 30, Mon",6.60
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588946,"By noon today the Bald was empty except for my crew and a half dozen day hikers.  Pretty much everyone caught a ride into town. Parts of the trail had reopened up to the gap just before the fire, so some hiked another 14 miles to get a ride.  Our plan was to spend another night up top and do two 7 miles days hoping the trail would open the final 7 by the time we got there.  Text messages from my brother in law the Mayor, stated differently and the trail would not likely be open this week.
Half way through the day the sun was beating down and there was no protection in the way of a tree or other natural cover and sitting in my tent was just too hot. I was feeling a little poorly, not to mention bored, so I started looking for a way off this bald. Before I started my search, I noticed a group of 9 senior citizens sporting small back packs out for a day hike.  I approached the youngest member simply for the name of the main road at the end of the eight mile dirt road that lead to this place. Of course she didn’t know but introduced me to the leader and driver of the van, claireece.  I was doing my best to keep my inquiry hushed so as not to get the entire group of seniors involved, but that didn’t work.  If I were a more talented writer, I could turn this into some sort of sit-com dialogue as it just got more people involved with questions about me, how I got here in the first place, why my car was in Michigan and what kind of mother would name her son Lorax. At one point two women were discussing that if I was really a hiker, then I would smell! “Why don’t you smell?” The other said I do smell, but I smell like coconut. In the end, the driver offered me a ride into Hot Springs after they finished there lunches. What I don’t know know until we were on our way down the hill to the parking lot, was the argument that took place in my absence about not wanting to give a potential “axe murderer” a ride into town.  Two and a half hours later and multiple opinions on the correct directions back to town, I was dropped off at the visitors center in downtown Hot Springs and all of the seniors were released unharmed an fully intact.
The rest of the day was rather uneventful other than talking with Cathy for a good hour.  I’m not feeling all that great, a little nauseous, tired and chilled but I hoping a good nights sleep in a warm comfortable bed will be just what I need.
The fire is still going with no certain timing for reopening the trail. I believe my best option is to indeed skip (for now) the burned potion of the trail and continue north from here and come back some time to finish up this 20 miles.","

After talking things over with my bride, it was determined that I should take another day off and stay in Hot Springs and and to the recovery. Hot Springs today is pretty much the same as it was yesterday and probably the day before; hikers coming and going, eating and drinking, restocking food supplies and upgrading equipment at the local outfitters.  Leaving town to the north and arriving from the south, but now those arrivals are still coming compliments of the locals shuttling the hikers in. Still now word as to when the trail will reopen due to the fire.
I left town today at 10:00am. The climb out of Hot Springs hot,  rocky and rapid but the view of the town was 
colorful and quite quaint.  It took about an hour or so but I caught up “Orion” sitting in a Hemlock growth eating a Hostess pie, Pringles and sipping tea.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589986,"Well happy Cinco de Mayo!  But just another day out here.  The sun came up in a clear sky this morning after a quiet night with what’s left of a full moon.  I will say that that moon was still bright enough illuminate a blanketed hillside of white and pink Trilliums.
Quickly the sky grew overcast with clouds of an expected rainstorm.  Orion and I managed 6 of a planned 9 miles when we came upon a hostel just up the road a piece. Thirsty for a cold drink and lunch, we made our way. No sooner had we taken seats on the the large wooden porch overlooking a fast moving stream, the weather finally broke loose with a fury of thunder, lightning, rain, hail and winds.  That made our decision easy to hunker down here for the night.  The storm lasted for hours and one by one, drenched hikers made their way down the country mud road and joined us for the night.  It finally quit raining around 7 and I’m warm and dry on the bottom bunk with 10 others watching a Star Wars movie.
More rain expected tomorrow and for most of the week...but at least it’s no longer bone chillingly cold.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589987,"The Hemlock Hollow Hostel is the nicest hostel at which I’ve stayed so far.  This hostel is far enough along the way that only committed hikers are checking in here.  Others hostels earlier on in the hike, still may have people that aren’t committed to the hike and are still feeling out the trail and might have a “party” attitude yet.  In addition, the hosts are a married couple new to the business and go the extra hard to see that their guests are happy.
Thunder, lighting and rain most of the night, right up until the time I left the bunkhouse. But when I hit the trail, it was nothing but rain and fog.  The first 3.5 miles were up and wet.  I stopped at the first shelter for a bite and to restock water. The shelter was packed with 12 other wet and cold hikers doing the same as me.  And after half an hour, I was back at it.
The day went on without incident and at one point around 2:00pm, I called my wife visiting her sister in Dallas and had a chance to FaceTime a good portion of her sisters family...sorry Chris and Alisha, Jay and Cammeron.  It so happened that it had just stopped raining and I was on a pretty tricky rock climb, so they may have seen what I was up to at that moment. Within an hour of that call the sun broke through and the climbing got even rockier and more intense.  The views were some of the absolute best that I’ve seen yet; 360 degrees of tree covered mountains, patchy with varied brightness due to the scattered clouds.  And when I finally got down off that ridge, I crossed the 300 mile mark on the Appalachian Trail!
It was a good day on the trail with the weather turning in my favor, the views and the next milestone, just about 10.5 miles and now I’m cozy in my tent listening to the winds rustling the new leaves of the trees surrounding my camp.","Hemlock Hollow Hostel

Again, a good amount of rocky up hill but I was rewarded with more wonderful views. In fact at one point, Big Butt Mountain, I ended up leaving my pack on the trail’s edge and climbing 30’ with only water a protein bar.  I spent the next 45 minutes enjoying the sun and my snacks.  That break was followed up with 2 or 3 other breaks over the next few hours.  My 7 mile hike ended up taking about 6 hours, a long day and short distance, but a good day.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

So while the day started out well it certainly slowed down, more big climbs; that basically means several hundred over a short distance. And while these altitudes may not seem too great to some of you, they’re pretty high for me (I live at about 600’) and I’m having a difficult time getting my “mountain lungs”.
I rolled into the shelter today around 4pm, I was the second here so I wanted to secure a spot in the shelter.  Since then several others have shown up, only two of which I know.  This new group, like many other groups, has a couple of blowhards that must make known their opinions, on any subject, and will use any type of language necessary to get their point across.  This truly is one of the low points of being out here, the language.
So rain is expected tomorrow again and I’d like to get out of here early and I don’t need to carry a wet tent.  My plan is to do 11 mile days Wednesday and Thursday then a 6 mile day on Friday.  I’ll take Saturday off for laundry and such.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589990,"It was a nice day right out of the gate. Started early, 845am, and started my daily climb.  The fact that the shelter was still had the blowhards in it, motivated me to get out. Several passed me because they’re “professional hikers” and now I’ll never have to see or listen to them again.  Of course every bubble of hikers has one or two of these people.
The target of the day was to get to the top of Big Bald at 5516’.  The hike was quiet and uneventful but took me through what I was calling the Dead Forest.  The entire climb was through a grassy field with large boulders, more toward the top, and thousands upon thousands of dead trees standing, leaning and laying, all in various stages of decay.  If the day were dark, foggy and overcast, this would have made the perfect setting for a movie shoot.  The top of the Bald provided 360 degrees of spectacular views and it’s always interesting to try and figure out from which direction I came.  I had considered spending the night on the Bald but arrived so early in the day I decided to push on a bit further and make my next couple of days a little shorter.
So I’m at the Big Bald Shelter with some young people that I’ve met in the past. A total 7 people and two dogs.  Dogs are nice to have on site as they tend to alert people and deter bear from hanging around.  This shelter was situated in the middle of the Dead Forest, though on the other side of the mountain, so it was pretty creepy once the sun went down.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

The sun rose in my eyes this morning. My watch read 623am so I turned over for another 40 minutes of peace and quiet.  No sooner had I settled down, the sky exploded in an instant downpour. Crypto and I both sat up and looked outside as it sound as though something fell on the building.  The water from the rain bounced off the tin roof in literal waves and made a slightly less intrusive crash when it fell upon the ground.  Within minutes there were standing pools outside the shelter and as suddenly as it started, it ended.  Within 30 minutes the shelter was closed with hikers who were either camping nearby or were caught on the trail without their rain gear handy.  And since they were now in a dry place, why not fix breakfast?  Before long, there were 15 people in the shelter and under the overhang cooking and eating.  This is likely one of the reasons this particular shelter is in such poor shape...you’re not supposed to cook and eat in the shelters, it’s leaves crumbs and trash and that invites animals.
I was out by 900am this morning but the rail left the trail in muddy condition and the first mile was a continuation of downhill, always dangerous in the mud. The day never really cleared up and I wS caught in another sudden rainstorm that lasted for all of the late morning and early afternoon.  Lunch was had on the side of a road passing through the forest but the only thing that passed were other hikers on their way north. Wouldn’t you know that the afternoon portion of my day was accompanied by more rain; this with hail and bouts of thunder and lighting.  But I hiked on and made it to my next destination and I’m secure in the shelter while it continues to rain.  I can state the obvious about the rain, everything is turning green and right before my eyes.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Coming into town was a challenging 3 mile descent.  Challengingly in that anytime one is walking downhill, the knees and the feet are tried without rest...but I’ll take downhill over uphill anyway.  I had very nice occasional views of the sleepy little town nestled right up against the mountains and when I finally exited the trail, I was dumped right out into a famous hostel and outfitter, Uncle Johnny’s.  I did stay there, but I accept a shuttle ride part way into town and lunched at a local pizza and salad buffet with some other hikers who were guests of Uncle Johnny.  Side note:  Sorry Momentum, this was NOT good pizza or salad bar, perhaps I was there on an “off” day.
I ended up staying in the neighboring town of Johnson City, where I was joined again by my college roommate, Craig, who has adopted the trail name of Gummy Bear. Though not a thru hiker, Gummy Bear has experienced the off trail life a number of times in the last two months by meeting me from his home in Atlanta and carting me around to do the things I need to do when in towns.  He does deserve credit though for successfully hiking the entire width of the trail - way to go Gummy Bear!

And thanks again to Gummy Bear for helping me with my off trail activities yesterday and today.  One of which is treating my clothing with a pesticide called Permetheran.  Outside my hotel yesterday, I suspended my bear line, hung all clothing except undershorts and saturated with this “safe”, deer free chemical. Once dry, clothes should protect against most insects, including ticks, which is a big concern out here this year. The application should be repeated every six washings.
My plan was to return to the trail by noon and only come into the trail about 4 miles. I came in 4 miles but didn’t get started until about 3:00pm due to the heat. At noon it was 90 degrees but by 3 it had cooled off to 88!  Most of the hike was rather flat, 2.5 miles of gradual uphill. But the last 1.5 got steeper, rockier and exposed me more to the sun.  In addition, my guidebook indicated that the water source here at the shelter at which I’m stay is rather week, so instead of taking any chances, I filled all drinkable water bottles, 2.5 liters plus totes another 3 liters of unfiltered water the last 1.5 miles which was another 7 pounds to my pack.  Good thing. The water source here is weak.
Four other hikers made it into camp by 7:00pm and they all agreed that today was not a day to hike too strenuously and since the rest of the week looks to be the same, we are all rethinking our approach to hiking.  However, there is also a 50-70% chance of rain every day this week and that could bring a little reprieve.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590709,"It’s 530pm and I’m already tucked into bed!  Why? Because I had no idea what time it really was when I stopped hiking for the day, I just knew how I felt and it felt like 6pm.
My day was uphill and it was hot!  I went just over 8 miles and still have 2 to go and another 1000’ up before I get to the top of THIS mountain.  The weather has gone from cold and rainy to HOT and humid in a matter of one week and it’s affecting everyone out here, not just me.  Every water source is surrounded with hikers like jungle animals gathering at the watering holes during the rainy season in Africa. But I’m not complaining even though those of you that know me, know that I don’t do heat real well; I’m just hoping that this is a heat wave and things will get back to “normal” soon.  
So I made it to a stealth campsite with a strong spring and decided enough for the day. I fixed dinner, cleaned up and hung my entire backpack from a tree rather than just my food.  And the reason I’m in my tent is because the bugs are so bad tonight it’s hard to just sit still without smacking myself silly.  So far, no one else has shown up to camp here, only to refill water before going on another 4 miles to the next site.  So with 
the exception of the bugs, the birds I hear in the distance, wood pecker and Bard Owl (who cooks for you, who cooks for who?) and whatever creatures roam these parts of the forest at night, I’m by myself.  And since there’s not rain in tonight’s forecast, I’m choosing to sleep without the rain fly on my tent which means just the screen...I’ll be able to look out past the trees and see the stars.
I have also been in touch with the Mayor, my brother-in-law who started this journey with me back in March.  He’s wanting to get back on the trail in some fashion or another, meaning day hikes or short section hikes. Hopefully he’ll be back giving it another try.","Curley Maple Gap Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590711,"Last night was crazy loud with animal sounds, all night!  Don’t these things sleep?  At least there was no bear activity!  I did however feel some raindrops just after sunset so to be safe, I attached my rainfly. There was no rain during the night.
This morning the bugs were still it in full force so I packed as quickly as I could and headed for a nearby road thinking there’d be fewer than in the deep woods. There wasn’t, so I ate breakfast through my bug netting, repacked and off I went.  Since there seemed to be no other campers nearby, I was thinking I might just hike without any interaction with other hikers this morning but out of nowhere came “Doc” and we hiked and chatted together for a good three hours; Doc is a retired chiropractor/acupuncturist/physical therapist from Florida up here doing a week of section hiking.  After lunch our paces split us up and I was alone with only my thoughts, my hopes, my dreams and all that other crap to keep me company.  I also had my poncho and I soon needed it!  Within 30 minutes of lunch it began to sprinkle and that was quickly replaced by one of those downpours that lasted for the next 5 hours.  Ultimately it didn’t matter that I had my poncho on, I was wet through to the bone and though I managed to keep water directly off my pack, the dampness cannot be stopped. 
I crossed a two lane highway, was passed by a car and I was hiking like it’s just another day.  Might that driver question what could this person possibly be thinking by being out here in a driving rainstorm? The same thing would go through my mind and I’m a hiker!  But what else could I do?  I know nobody in the area, I have nowhere else to go, I don’t even know where I am or which state I’m in, so I keep going.  It makes no sense to stop and sit on the side of the trail to wait it out because who knows how long it will last and I’ll just continue to get wet and likely cold, so I keep going on.  
I was reading in Proverbs about wisdom and thinking how I might practice it out here. One thing a hiker doesn’t want to do is hike across an open bald in a lightning storm carrying two aluminum trekking poles. And as I was marching down off a mountain keeping time with the rhythm of the rain and low rolling thunder, I came to an open gap (not a bald) about 40 yards wide with an occasional dead fruit tree distributed throughout.  I stood at the beginning of this gap thinking Ok Lord, what should I do here?  The lyrics to a gospel song came to mind about listening for the voice of God... “sometimes He shouts, more times He whispers”.  Suddenly the soundtrack in my mind changed songs and I was singing “Should I stay or should I go now?” by The Clash.  Even more suddenly a huge flash of lightning and instantaneous crack of thunder from behind sent me moving into that gap without a second thought.  About 100 feet into my hightail across that field with my poles tucked under my arm (to minimize the target) while my version of the next line from The Clash song continued playing in my mind...”if I stay there will be trouble, if I go it may be double”.  Too late, I was across that 200 yard field in no time and back into the safety of trees.  So that voice was a shout, but was it saying stay or go?
Fourteen and a half miles today, ten in the rain.  I’m now in bed, everything is wet or damp and I’ll be back out in the soup tomorrow. The crew I’m camping with tonight, including Doc, have ambitious plans for tomorrow, 17 miles followed by 15 on Thursday and that’s just a bit too aggressive for me.  So I’ll do 10 or 12 and see who I meet tomorrow night.","Stealth campsite

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590865,"It hardly rained at all last night, maybe a bit, but not to speak of until 600am when the camp generally starts to stir with early risers wanting to beat rush hour and get on the trail.  Having a difficult time getting motivated to get back out in this weather, I was the last one out today at 10am, meaning it had been raining for at least 4 hours already.  I hiked alone for two hours and when I finally came down into a gap, there was a young couple under a tent shouting my name, inviting me for some trail magic!  What a welcome sight, the first for me in a couple of weeks.  It seems the others that I camped with the night before advised these angels of my pending arrival.  Tank, because of his size is from Ohio and his girlfriend, Toepick, because she had difficulty adjusting hockey skates after a lifetime on figure skates, is from Allen Park, MI.  They met on the trail as members of the Class of 2017 and came down on their vacations to provide trail magic.  How about that?  As I was about ready to leave, in rolled Short Mile from PA and a hiker I met the day before at lunch, Blue Raccoon; she was slack packing today, meaning she was carrying enough food and water to get her through the day. No tent, clothes or sleeping bag. Just a very light pack with the expectation of putting in some decent miles.
Leaving the trail magic was hard.  Putting that back pack back on in the rain and heading up Roan Mountain was a chore; an incline 2200’ over a 7 mile stretch.  Though the views were pure white with fog and rain clouds, the trail zig zagged through a beautiful forest of spruce trees that was littered with jagged rocks and slippery roots that acted as a temporary riverbed while the heavy rains sought lower elevations.  As in the Smoky’s, it made no sense to try and keep dry, just walk right in the middle of the trail.  At least today the temps were in the 50’s and not the 30’s (bright spot!) 
Blue Racoon is named after her father’s favorite coon dog, Blue. She caught up with me soon after leaving the gap and we had a pleasant conversation and hike through the elements.  However her light pack and my pack, which continued to gain weight as the day wore on, soon separated us and I was again on my own.  We did make plans to meet at the Roan Mountain Shelter (top of the mountain) and hike down together where her husband would drive me to a nearby town and I would meet my Brother-in-law, The Mayer, as he came up from Florida for his triumphant return to the AT.  I checked into a budget type hotel, unpacked everything to dry out, took a long hot shower and dressed in my driest wet clothes.  I should add, my back pack normally weighs around 37-43 pounds. Blue Racoon’s husband picked it up to put it in his vehicle and commented that it was closer to 55 or 60 lbs today.
I’m happy to report that I am warm and happy tonight.  Thank you Blue Racoon, her husband Papa Big Swig and The Mayor.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590867,"The Mayor is here, so why not slack pack?!  And that’s exactly what I did.  I loaded up a small day pack with lunch, snacks, bug spray, sun screen, water and certain toiletries just in case.  We drove to Carver’s Gap where I had exited the trail the day before.  Upon arrival I met Nick, a Triple Crown* hiker and Not Yet, a retired NY fire fighter from The Bronx (also a Yankee fan).  After introductions to the Mayor we all set off for our north bound hike.  The Mayor hiked though a beautifully cared for trail winding its way through a pungent spruce forest that emptied onto a lower altitude bald...what a way to be welcomed back to the trail.
The day was bright and sunny but darkness loomed on the horizon. I hiked with both Nick and Not Yet independently for about an hour and around noon I was off on my own trying to see what I could do with 8 lbs rather than 58.  Up ahead was an old barn turned into a shelter for the AT hikers.  I set off on the trail to check it out, but was sidetracked by the previously mentioned looming darkness.  Not wanting to delay the impending, I decided to forego the barn, resupply my water and get back on the trail; too bad I forgot to bring my water filter, so I had only 750ml of water for what turned out to be 14.5 miles.
I felt I was doing pretty well today, up hill for 2 miles, level for 1, up hill for 3 miles with “several false summits for north bounders” according to the AWOL guide book.  The views were incredible looking back at the barn shelter from above. I was able to see a storm roll in from the east, clipping me but not affecting the views to the west, which is where I was heading. As I approached the next 3 mile climb, I targeted a white dot high on the mountain side, that was my goal.  The higher I got the farther that dot got from me and as another cell came in from the east, it completely engulfed the distant mountain views, the white dot, me and the entire mountain top on which I stood.  False summits mean nothing when the visibility is 20-30 feet.  As I finally did summit, out from behind a distant rock formation and into the dense fog, appeared the silhouette of a man heading my way.  This was the only person I had seen in several miles/hours and the way he appeared was unreal.  As he approached I snapped a photo and at that instant he was holding up two fingers as if saying “I come in peace.”  Good, that’s about all I was prepared for!  It turned out he worked for the trail and state park system as a ridge runner of sort and had been on the job for only 3 hours...what a day to start a new job.
The rain continued for several more hours and the clothes and shoes that were almost dry this morning were once again soaked through.  As the rain began to slow I eventually caught up to the white dot I had been pursuing most of the afternoon.  The trail was descending for over 6 miles. It was wet and slippery, in some spots under water and again littered with big rocks and boulders that required concentration, confidence, grace, timing and sure footedness in order to successfully step and/or jump down the side of the mountain.  It seemed that the white dot misstepped just prior to the point at which I caught up and was picking herself up off the muddy trail.   Not seeming embarrassed at all she turned, surprised to see me standing there and greeted me with a big smile as if she was Pee Wee Herman saying, “I meant to do that”...it was Blue Raccoon in her white rain poncho, out slack packing in the rain for the second day in a row.  We hiked the next 6 miles together through the rain, some sunshine, more rain until we crossed a field and passed a sign informing us that we are leaving North Carolina for good!   No more will we be crossing back and forth between these two states not really knowing where we are.  From now on, we’ll not know where we are in Tennessee!  That also means that there are no more privy’s at the shelters because Tennesseeans believe you should just do your business in the woods.  Or a field. Either way, be sure to bury it.
About 3 miles from the end of the trail we were greeted by The Mayor who hiked in to meet us. He got a taste of the trail and met a few hikers along the way.  He put in some miles today at both ends of my hike and I hope that his rehab won’t be negatively affected.
I on the other hand have developed some blisters on the “ring” toes of each foot. Wet shoes!  I went to an outfitters to seek advice on “maybe” some new shoes, but they were useless.  So my shoes are stacked on the register in our room and I’ll just end up taping up my feet in the morning as I plan to slack pack again tomorrow in the probable rain.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591082,"Well today was for the most part a contrast to yesterday - the weather, the topography, the terrain, the views, the company even the direction...
The weather.  Today was storming in town and that generally means that it will be doing the same in the mountains, but it wasn’t.  Light rain to start the day, mostly overcast but it worked hard to become a nice day with bits of sunshine scattered throughout.
The Direction.  I went north to south and covered 14.5 miles.  What this did was give me an opportunity to see many more hikers than I normally would since pretty much everybody at this point on the trail is going north and I just don’t pass people.  I passed so many people that I already know and may not have seen for awhile, it was good to catch up. However, I probably spent at least an hour or more talking with them while I could have been hiking.
The company.  I was solo and planned on being by myself all day.  I started out with the Mayor for the first mile or so before he turned about and started working on his own hiking goals.
The views.  There were very few views of mountaintops and what there were, were unremarkable. In fact if I had been hiking in the other direction, I may not even have noticed them.
Topography and terrain.  There of course was climbing, there always is but nothing like yesterday.  Most ascents and descents were quick and moderate and for the most part under the cover of foliage.  The views were not of or from mountains but of numerous rivers and creeks that flowed in every direction.  For the first 9 miles of the day, rarely was I out of ear shot of a water source.  And while yesterdays trails included a lot of rocks and boulders, todays had very few. Instead the paths for the most part were smooth and soft under foot; spongy without being saturated.  The trail was covered with a blanket of pine needles, rhododendron and hardwood leaves making the walk very quiet.  Only the sounds of the breeze from high above, the leftover rain drops falling from the branches on to my rain jacket and the sounds of the running streams, were evident.  Occasionally the sun would break through the canopy in sharp beams and dot the floor with reflective light that shimmered as I moved through them.  One of the hikers I ran into today was Poppins. A young lady from the UK who hikes in a skirt and carries an umbrella, told me of a couple of highlights I could expect in the coming miles today. And in her charming British accent advised me to “take liberty and spend some time in the delightful meadow that banks the river. The wildflowers, birds and butterflies will make your experience all the more lovely.  And I “mussent” miss Jones Waterfall, it’s breathtaking and well worth the detour from the trail.  I’ll surely want to delay any urgency to continue my hike.”  She was correct on both counts, it was delightful and lovely.  To date, this has been my favorite section of the hike.
Topography and terrain continued.  The last 3 miles of today’s hike was the worst ever!  It was through a series of overgrown two track roads and narrow paths of dirt winding aimlessly across fields of tall wet weeds, that were no doubt infested with ticks and other biting insects, just hanging over the trail tickling my legs as I walked by.  I couldn’t complete this section quickly enough.  I felt like a boy, done with my paper route, walking home through a hot weedy field with a sack full of undelivered papers. All I wanted to to do is drop the weight, eat my dinner and tell my dad that I didn’t want to deliver papers anymore.
...In the back of my mind I heard his voice say something that affectionately included the word “buttercup.”

Today was a pretty nondescript day in the world of Lorax hiking.  I got out of the gate a bit late this morning, roughly 1030, and like the last few days, was joined by the Mayor for the first mile of my hike before he moved on to hike other sections of the trail on his own.  I was moving pretty quickly and made it to the Moreland Gap Shelter by noon where I settled in for a quick snack.  Given the water source  is a good distance away from the shelter AND down a steep incline, I chose to hold off on the resupply for another 2.5 miles.  But wouldn’t you know that within 10 minutes of leaving the shelter, it started to rain.  Maybe an hour of a steady light rain was enough to annoy and make the trail just a bit more slippery.  Now maybe I over do it a bit, but rain always seems to slow me down no matter what the terrain.  Someday I hope to spend an entire day in sunshine.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591350,"I planned on a short day today, two miles that I decided not to do yesterday and then another six miles up and down Pond Mountain.  The reason I wanted to do the two miles today rather than yesterday is to warm up my lungs.  My asthma has been acting up early in the day causing pretty intense burning in my chest if I jump out on a trail and attack a climb right out of the gate.  It’s my least favorite part of most days. 
So my warm up was a very pretty walk through a wooded trail with a good number of sizable rocky cliffs lining both sides from time to time. The Lauren Fork River played a significant part in the trail’s path and scenery as well in that it is ultimately highlighted at Lauren Falls, a nearly 30’ roaring waterfall that I completely missed.  How could I miss a waterfall like that?  Remember the importance of the blaze?  When a trail splits there are the “white blazes” that tell us where the main trail goes and perhaps a “blue blaze” that announces a side trail. A blue blazed trail may lead to a water source, shelter or even an alternate route.  The main trail that the Mayor and I were on turned a hard left, almost hairpin, while a side trail continued on straight ahead.  The Mayor found out later that the “straight ahead side trail” was blazed blue but was covered by a fallen tree so it went unnoticed. Before we knew it, we were standing in front of the Lauren Fork Shelter, one mile past and a pretty decent climb above the falls. As we made our way back to the main trail, I was in no mood to add over two miles to my day by going back to see the falls as I’m sure I’ll see many more over the next 1700+ miles.  The Mayor on the other hand, decided to head back that way and have a look for himself and he was impressed; the attached photo is courtesy of him.
So I made my way up the mountain and for the next 1.5 hours I climbed a series of switchbacks in the sun and the heat and was rewarded with only a spring of fresh cold mountain water, though I was promised views from the summit.  In fact I hardly noticed the summit at all, just the spring and a gradual decline in elevation that followed the flow of the stream for a very short distance.  This seemed to be one of the few times that I’ve actually climbed one side of a mountain and gone down the other side. And wouldn’t you know it, the sun suddenly disappeared, the temperature dropped at least 10 degrees and the always expected afternoon rain began to fall.  So suddenly it started, that I just threw my backpack in a plastic trash bag and carried it over my shoulder for the next hour as I whistled and sang my way to the bottom. By the time I exited the trail, the rain stopped and it was once again a beautiful day; in fact the ground wasn’t even wet.
Tomorrow I’ll be taking a zero and get back out here again on Tuesday.  It always feels good to eat food that someone else prepared, take a hot shower, shave my head (!) and sleep in a bed.  Life is tough on the trail.","Dennis Cove Rd., Hostel

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591620,"The Mayor is gone and I’m back at it solo.
I started out in front of the Boots Off Hostel near Lake Watauga.  The trail followed along the shoreline of lake and due to all the recent rain, the lake level was quite high and had flooded portions of the trail.  I went around two such flooded sections but came to the third and turned around as the trail was taped off and “technically” closed.  There were branches and leaves floating across the trail and from what I could see, the water was at least 1-2’ deep and the other side of the flooded trail was not visible.  So I turned around (I HAD DRY SHOES!) and once I got back out to the parking lot I learned, then confirmed with the Mayor, that just up the highway is a side road that is blue blazed and routes hikers around such trail issues; apparently this has happened before.  Without too much more trouble, I was back on the trail making my way to the north.
The day was a warm and sunny again, temperature around 80 degrees and not much of a breeze. I took my first break for a protein bar and almonds at the Wakue Dam.  The construction of the dam was in simplistic terms was just gravel and rocks piled up several hundred feet high and likely just as wide at the base. A paved service road ran across the top, each side lined with with huge boulders no doubt retrieved from the shear rock cliffs at either end of the dam.  A spillway was located on the lake side of the dam and although there was no visible water on the dry side, I could hear a loud rush of water deep down in a tree protected gorge as I walked by.  There was also a small electrical substation nearby. I have no idea how old this dam is but wonder if it wasn’t there, how deep and how big the lake would be or if it would even be there at all.  I suppose I could find that out...
Once I got past the dam I climbed about 1800’ over 5.5 miles. I ran into Stripes, AT Class of 2016. Stripes got her name because she fell asleep on her fold up sleep mattress and woke up with the striped pattern on her legs.  I also bumped into Big Lots, a 26 year old from St. Pete, FL.  We met 3 weeks ago at The Davenport Gap Shelter just as we were both completing the Smoky Mountains.  He got his name because he shopped for his food at the Big Lots store. He and Stripes were slack packing out of Damascus where they spent the weekend at Trail Days.
Wouldn’t you know that right after I left Big Lots, it started to rain.  The final 2 miles were not uncomfortable but my clothes, including my shoes aren’t dry anymore! I don’t remember dry clothes or shoes.
Once here at the shelter a young man named Kuck showed up telling stories of the closed trail down by the lake.  Someone had removed the tape closing the trail and he along with his crew waded through the waist deep water. There were two trails exiting the water and neither one had a white blaze on it, but obviously chose the right one. He also mentioned hiking past a 12-15” carp as they waded through flood waters.  Kuck wears leather boots and they are still wet tonight, but he doesn’t care...they’ve been wet for two weeks.
It’s still raining but the sun did come out long enough late this afternoon to cause a scene behind the shelter. A rainbow seemed to bring a smile to everyone’s face and the red sky at sunset filled us all with hope for a beautiful day tomorrow, wet shoes and all.","Shook Branch Recreation Area

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591623,"A little more about last night at the Vandeventer Shelter, I saw the sun set through partly cloudy skies as the shelter opened to the west. The clouds filled the lower sky with a magnificent yellow, orange and red blend that peaked through the green of the trees. What a positive way to end a rain soaked day.  In addition, the night sky was clear as a bell with a quarter moon, again signs of a nice day today.
I awoke to the all too familiar sound of rain falling on the metal roof of the shelter.  5:00am until shortly after 9:00, just enough to moisten the already wet trail and keep them interesting.  I had planned on doing 15 miles today but stopped for water and a snack at 11:00 and ended up staying until 12:30 because Mud Bug, whom I’ve hiked with in the past, was coming south out of Damascus covering trail that she’d missed due to attending Trail Days last weekend.  She’s doing well and it was good to get caught up.  I hiked another 4 miles before stopping for lunch at the Iron Mountain Shelter...which is where I sit now.  As I was about to eat my lunch it started to rain and that’s all she wrote, I called it a day after 7 miles.
As I settled in for the night people from my past started to show up, some passing through but a couple are staying, Freight Train is here and Blue Raccoon showed up with her originally frankly, Big Kahuna and Hugs.  Within one hour 14 people showed up so the shelter is full and there are 11 tents and or hammocks are now scattered throughout the grounds.  The problem with all these late show ups is that everybody cooks at the shelter building and they’re all winding down talking about the fun of the daily adventure.
The rhododendrons are beginning to bloom,  be it only one variety, they’re on there way.  Unfortunately the rain beats the daylight out of them so pedals are everywhere on the ground.  Other species that grow on trees are also beginning to make appearances as well.
Finally, rumors are running rampant of a rouge bear that has been fake charging people.  I’ve only heard of one incident but these people are talking several.  I’m heading in that direction tomorrow morning. If I see a bear, I’m going to fake charge him; see how he likes it!","Vandeventer Shelter

So I woke up to before the sunrise to the sound of birds, a lot of them and it was beautiful. The sky was clear and it was shaping up to be a great day.  However breakfast was kind of a drag in that a young man from somewhere in Europe with certainly no table etiquette  and maybe no social etiquette either, sat at the table smoking weed, hacking loudly without covering his mouth and emitting other bodily sounds while others were eating or preparing breakfast.  It was noticed by several but sadly mentioned by none, including me. Fortunately he hiked past the shelter at which I’m camping tonight so I may not see him again.
I mentioned yesterday that Blue Raccoon showed up at the shelter last night with her tramily of two others, Hugs, a nurse practitioner from Nevada and Big Kahuna, retired after 40 years service with the US Air Force.  I was invited to hike along with these three today and really enjoyed their company and pace.  There was a lot of climbing again, most of it through plush green hardwood forests with the not so frequent (as usual) rhododendron trees that have lined much of the trail no matter where I’ve been so far.  But early on this morning we entered a meadow for perhaps a mile then climbed a fence into a cow pasture for maybe another mile. Unfortunately there were no cattle roaming about but plenty of proof that they’d been there recently.  Mud Bug whom I’d crossed paths with yesterday mentioned that the pasture was active yesterday morning when she hiked through.  “Keep your eyes on the bulls”, she warned.
The weather, the terrain, the company, the mileage (16.5, my biggest day yet)...everything about the day was enjoyable, including a chance to talk with my bride Cathy for a good while this afternoon. Did I mention no rain today?  Clear sky and windy right now with a bright moon above.  I’ve been invited to hike with this crew again tomorrow as we go 10 miles into Damascus, VA, where I look forward to a package from home and visiting with an outfitter about some equipment issues.

The birds interrupted a perfectly good night’s sleep, so I was up before the dawn.  Didn’t matter.  I, along with the new crew I’m running with, wanted to hit the trail early and who am I to argue?  So they hit the trail just before 8:00 and I was out by 8:10, hot on their tails.  Again there were ups and downs but because we were heading into a town, Damascus, VA, they were mostly down.
Today’s trail section was again a very soft trail of sand and hardwood leaves with a few embedded rocks and tree roots to navigate, but nothing a sure footed poser like me couldn’t handle. For the most part I hiked with Blue Raccoon again. This time we both had full packs so it was a bit harder than the last time we hiked together.  I enjoy hiking with her, good pace and good conversation.
Six and a half miles into our hike, we crossed out of Tennessee and into Virginia; goodbye and hello. (Virginia has both privys AND bear cables or boxes).  The state line was symbolized by a line of flat football (American football) sized rocks from one side of the trail to the other.  Blue Raccoon and I waited for Hugs and Big Kahuna and the four of us crossed  over together.  We were collectively disappointed that there was no band or fanfare to celebrate so we stepped over to the signs and forever immortalized the moment with the photo posted above. (The photo was taken by another hiker, Lost and Found, who got his name because he kept losing things and people would return them to him).
The rest of the hike was all down hill and that emptied into the town of Damascus.  Damascus is known as Trail Town USA and hosts an annual celebration of the AT and its hikers called Trail Days.  This celebration lasts an entire weekend and this sleepy mountain town of 950 is overrun with music, vendors and hikers who either are or have hiked the trail.  I didn’t attend, I’m here to hike but I’m told it was quite a party.
Once here, the four of us went straight to a restaurant, lined our back packs up against the wall outside the building with half a dozen other packs and went inside for some real non-trail food. I think I was expecting more and left a little disappointed.  What we don’t expect and should know better by now, was the sudden afternoon rain shower that soaked our packs and left them sitting in an inch deep puddle.  After twenty minutes or so, the sun came back out and heated things up again.  Is it too much to ask for two days in a row without...never mind, of course it is.
Tonight we returned to the same restaurant for a couple of appetizers, an ice cold beverage and to play euchre for 2-3 hours.
I received my package from home today and will ready a return package tomorrow. In the meantime, tomorrow morning we’re to be driven 12.5 miles north of town to the middle of nowhere and hike back to town with only water and a few snacks.  This should kill about 6 or 7 hours.","Abington Gap Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592102,"I must say that the Woodchuck Hostel is so far the nicest and most welcoming hostel I’ve come across on the trail. The owner, Woodchuck, or probably (hopefully) just Chuck to his parents, hiked the entire AT in 2013 and now serves the hikers with lodging and shuttle service.
This morning the crew and I decided to do another day of slack packing from the north side of Damascus and hike just over 15 miles south back into town with minimal weight on our backs.  Woodchuck drove us north and by 9:15am we were on the trail, single file like a family of ducks.  As often happens no matter where I am in my life or what I’m doing, I forgot something, my bug spray!  Fortunately that didn’t matter because unfortunately it started raining at 9:16am and continued for the first 12 miles.  The rain was steady and at times even unnoticeable, because I’m so used to it. But as the elevation increased the clouds or fog began to thicken and the wind picked up so it got a bit chilly.  We broke for water and a snack at Saunders Shelter which is around the 6 mile mark from where we started. It was at this time I put my rain jacket on to squelch the chill.
I learned a new term this weekend from a seasoned hiker, “PUDS”. PUDS means “pointless ups and downs”. Today things weren’t so bad today heading south, but I do feel bad for the north bounders as much of their trek was up and even more up.  Just as when I had SOBO’d in the past, I had a chance to see many of the people that I’d met in the past and not seen nor heard about is several weeks.  I had no idea that I was so close to them and it was good to catch up a bit and see that they’re still out here.
Some of the AT in this area shares the trail with the Virginia Creeper Trail which is a converted railroad bed and is used for both hiking and bicycling; the above photo is an old railroad bridge built on the original wood frame structure that towers high above a trail of some sort and a river.  The AT also runs alongside and crosses several creeks and streams that ultimately empty into the Lauren Creek, which when I finally was able to see it, looked more like a raging river with huge rocks and logs creating rapids and multiple currents that would prevent the “creek” from being easily forded; at least by an inexperienced forder. The dominant sound in the forest today was water; either rain hitting the leaves or my jacket or that of the rapids from any one of the aforementioned streams. The dominance of color is still green, but it is gladly beginning to share the spotlight the bright pink of the rhododendrons, the soft white of the mountain laurels and the imposing orange of what appears to be Honey Suckle, which Blue Raccoon has told me they’re not.  (I’ll look it up). Nonetheless, the colors are exploding for my pleasure and I’m appreciative.
The last 4 miles brought out the sun and with that came humidity so off came my jacket and I was warmed.  The birds replaced the sound of water and that was ultimately replaced by the sound of bicycles and the buzz of speeding traffic from Highway 58, on the shoulder of which the AT shares.
Tonight Blue Raccoon and I stayed in and had leftover dinner on the deck of the hostel while Hugs and Big Kahuna walked downtown to one of the fine dining establishments for which Damascus is famous.
I will be separating with my hiking crew tomorrow as I need to attend to the needs of my feet. Hopefully our paths will cross again and I will be in their fine company once more.","Grassy Ridge Rd.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592778,"After two zeros in a row, I think I’m ready to go again. I was getting a little bored and antsy wanting to get back on the trail.  My feet have been acting up and I needed to get them addressed.  So Sunday was the day that I bought some new shoes, Ultra’s.  These are the most popular shoes out here and they fit so we’ll see how that goes.  I wore them around town yesterday and they felt pretty good.  It didn’t rain hard enough to soak them, but it’s coming.
Woodchuck shuttled me back to the trail this morning at about 9:00am and I was off.  I was looking forward to the very first shelter along today’s route, Lost Mountain Shelter, because rumor has it that the story of the Lorax is printed on the walls of the privy, and it was!  The above photo is taken in front of it.  Those of you that are literary scholars know what the word “unless” means with regards to the Lorax; I include this word each time I sign one of the shelter log books. 
Just as I was leaving the shelter I ran in to Train Wreck with whom I hiked through and just past the Smoky’s.  It was good to see him again and we hiked together for a good part of the day.
I covered about 14 miles today and as the story goes, it started to rain around 10:30 this morning while I was climbing the first of two mountains.  The terrain of Whitetop Mountain was a mix of rocky, soft, really soft and wet.  I passed Train Wreck sitting on a rock having a sandwich in the light rain and I continued on to the top where I was met with 40 mph winds and fog but no rain.  As I summited, the landscape began to open up to a rocky bald. The trail weaved trough an old, neglected fruit orchard whose trees still bore leaves and some even had the tight buds of soon to be blossoms, but all trees were covered in layers of various colored and weathered moss/fungi indicating how long they’d been without care.  Below the fruit trees stood waist high raspberry bushes, thick and choking out anything else that might try to lay claim to the land. These plants displayed already opened blossoms of promised fruit. Finally beneath the raspberry bushes and lining the trail were varied feathered grasses and wild miniature strawberry vines hugging the ground showing off their tiny white blooms.  I continued on and found shelter in a small gorge behind a rock formation and managed a bag of almonds and a protein bar before Train Wreck caught up and headed down the mountain together anticipating our next.  
Mount Rogers is Virginia’s highest peak at 5729’.  Getting there was one of my hardest climbs to date. Remember the term PUDS? This was all PU., over the course of 4 miles I climbed over the most rocks and the biggest tree roots with water flowing over them you could imagine. In many locations the foot trail lead off into the woods to circumnavigate a truly treaturous spot on the trail.  Did I mention that is started to rain again?  3:00, and as of this writing at 10:00, it continues.  All I can really say about my surroundings while hiking today is they were dark and wooded. It’s hard to pay attention to what kind of trees, landscapes or views I might be passing when all a can focus on is the trail and my footing. It’s exhausting. 
The top of Mount Rogers is somewhat cleared of trees, there are a few old dead pine trees, that make for interesting silhouettes against the white background of fog, some smaller bushes growing in clumps, tall grasses and a lot of rocks. Little rocks, big rocks and huge rocks.  The fog was so dense there were no views to be had.
I arrived at the Thomas Knob Shelter and it was packed.  Two levels slept 18 and both levels were full.  Train Wreck, Spoon and Renoir left me a message at the shelter that they were setting up camp 1/4 mile up the trail at an established campsite.  It was still raining very hard and the last thing I wanted to do was set up my tent, get in it wet, pull my wet backpack in and then break camp in the pouring rain tomorrow morning.  So I settled in for the night.  It should also be noted that there has been some unusual bear activity in the area lately.  I can’t confirm the number, but I heard that a bear, maybe more than one, is responsible for taking 40 “properly hung” food bags down from trees and running off with them.  As a result, Virginia Trail Club has installed three bear boxes in the area that can’t be opened without thumbs and one of the boxes is enclosed inside an electric fence.
Finally, there are supposed to be herds of wild ponies in this part of VA and there is proof of their existence everywhere, just too much fog to see, or maybe they know better than to be out in weather like this.  Well there’s lots of Virginia to go, I’m sure I’ll run into some sooner or later.","Grassy Ridge Rd.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592779,"It rained most of the night, I could hear the rain on the tin roof even though I was on the lower level.  Apparently no one slept really well last night, once the rain finally stopped the wind kicked up and whistled through and around that shelter even though a tarp was provided to cover the open side of shelter.
I was awaken this morning not by birds or sunlight but by the smell of someone smoking weed right outside the shelter and the breeze bringing it inside.  It turned out to be the same European guy that was smoking at the breakfast table last week. This time someone said something about getting high at 6:00 in the morning; I don’t get it.
The electric fence worked well in that everyone’s food was safe through the night.  I ate my breakfast without the smell of marijuana and was on my way by 8:30.  It of course had started raining again and continued on through most of the morning. I decided not to wear a rain jacket since it was around 60 degrees and I’d get wet anyway, but the wind was kind of chilly as the first 1.5 miles was on an exposed mountain top; I couldn’t wait to get under the protection of trees.  The trail was flooded.  There was no choice but to walk right down the middle of the puddles in order to make progress. My feet were soaked within minutes and they stayed that way all day.  The weather finally broke at noon. It got brighter and brighter and before long the sun shone through ever so briefly and I saw my shadow...which means six more weeks of rain.  By 1:00 it was raining again.
I managed to see the wild ponies about which Virginia boasts. First through a very thick fog and rain, I had to leave the trail to photograph them.  But later in the day they were everywhere, even standing right on the trail.  The little ones were quite skittish and would stick close to the adults, but if the adults were on the trail, so were the young un’s (Southern talk for young one’s).  It was pretty cool to be so close to them, in a couple of cases it was a matter of only 10 yards.  The ponies shared the same field, although 1/2 mile apart, with bulls.  There must have been 40 or 50 grazing or just laying around and boy are those things HUGE.  The closest I came was 50-75 yards and they made an impression on me. A couple just lay there and watched me as I walked by and really paid me no mind. Of course I kept scanning the entire landscape looking for one that perhaps I hadn’t seen sneaking up on me like they do in cartoons...they were all in on it!  I also saw a snake. I picked up a rock to tie to my bear line and it slithered out of the fire pit.  Not sure what kind it was, didn’t matter. It was a snake.  All in all, a good day for wildlife.
Within 6 miles of today’s mud trail walk I crossed the 500 mile mark of my hike.  That’s just over 25% of the trail completed!  It feels good to hit these markers, like I’ve accomplished something.
I wanted 16 miles today but the weather, the condition of the trail and my new shoes convinced me that was a bit too ambitious.  I’m in the Old Orchard Shelter tonight with Lost and Found, it’s very quite and pretty cold.  Nearby campers include Spoon, Renoir and Monk.  The sun came out at 3:30 this afternoon and by 5:00 the sky was bright and clear. We all spread out our wet clothes and shoes in the sun to dry out and while we were doing something to set up camp, the wind began to blow pretty hard and within 5 minutes it began to rain. Since I was hanging my food bag, I was right there to gather my stuff.  The others came running!  The rain has now stopped and a cold breeze blows, perhaps tonight will be a good night for sleeping.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592781,"There were two of us in the shelter last night and it was a good night to sleep.  The wind is impressive to listen to in the forest. It can be dead quite and the leaves at the top of the trees, sometimes well over 100’ up, begin a soft rustle to let you know they’re coming; there is typically no breeze down low at a shelter because the shelters are in a gap and the topography naturally blocks the wind. These winds can be intense and travel in pockets that can be heard from a distance. As it gets closer, of course it gets louder and will sustain the volume and even pressure until the pocket blows through and ends as suddenly as it began.  Then another pocket will blow but this one may be off to the east or west with slightly less volume.  This happened throughout the night and these pockets gently lulled me to sleep.  Around midnight the wind settled and was replaced with rain but my attention to that was brief as I quickly drifted back to sleep.  I was awaken a few times over the next couple of hours so I know it rained until at least 2:00 am and when I woke up at 3:00, dead silence. I sat up, looked outside and saw the field in the distance were several tents were pitched, was illuminated by a nearly full moon in a clear sky that stayed that way through sunrise.
So I woke up to bright sunshine today, had breakfast, broke camp and headed on my way.  I was to meet some people 5 miles up the trail for lunch at the Hurricane Gap Shelter.  The trail was mostly downhill and moist for the first 2 miles but the sun stayed out and dried up what it could.  The last 3 miles was uphill and rocky so it took me a bit longer than the first two and I missed lunch.  I noticed that my bride Cathy texted me concerned because of the current weather map...Alberto is supposed to be coming this way.  I had a signal so while I was alone, I took the opportunity to FaceTime her. I love seeing and talking to her via FaceTime while I’m down here. In the middle of our conversation, Renoir pulled in for lunch, he was one of the people I was to meet.  Renoir is from Paris and from what I understand, is a part time artist; he paints murals and graffiti mostly but does some other drawing as well.  One of which I asked him to show Cathy while I had her on the phone; it is a self portrait in his journal with black and white pen on manilla paper.  Very nicely done.  While Cathy was on the phone, it began to rain.
After lunch the weather cleared and off I went. I had another 10 miles in mind for a total of 15.  The trail was quite rocky again and I’m sporting these new shoes that seem to be working out pretty well but they have no rock plate in the sole, meaning I feel every rock’s sharp corner or edge and every root I step on.  I now need to look for a more flat surface to step on until my feet toughen up a little more.
I made it the 10 miles to the Trimpi Shelter.  There are only two people whom I’d ever met before, both of them today as they passed me on the trail.  Everybody else is new and they seem to be good people; 20’s to early 30’s and no partiers. They’re interested in each other’s stories and it’s nice to have conversations with interesting AND interested people.  I’m certain I will not be waking up with a contact buzz in the morning.
Lights out early tonight as the bright sky suddenly grew dark around 6:00 pm.  People finished their dinners and hung their food bags by the light of their headlamps then made their way off to bed.  It’s been raining since 6:30 and it’s soft and gentle; there are even a number of fireflies dancing outside in the distance.  Though we were all disappointed by the early darkness and sudden end to the social aspect of dinner, we are all thankful to have hiked on a gorgeous day and to take off dry shoes for a change.","Old Orchard Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592782,"Wow, June 1st!
One of those dancing fire flies from last night danced its last dance and I was a witness.  As lay in the shelter trying to fall asleep, one flew in (perhaps to get out of the rain), and eventually got trapped in a spider web between the rafters.  It struggled and flashed like crazy until its flashing got slower and longer until...lights out, RIP.
So all the youths that camped at the shelter last night were up at 6:00 am and on their way by 7:00. This of course got me going and I was on the trail by 7:45, my earliest yet and still I was second to the last to leave camp.  My goal was Marion, VA, a short (?) 10 miles from camp.  This was a PERFECT day to hike, temps in the low 70’s and a cool breeze out of the West for most of the day. There were a few clouds, but the rain held off until 3:30, I arrived in town at 2:00.
Because I’ve had two good weather days in a row, the trail was in pretty good shape, most of it dry and relatively easy to navigate.  Several smallish sharp rocks and roots to dance around but at least it was dry.  About a mile of today’s stroll was through another pasture surrounded by beautiful mountains, but most of the trail was typical hardwood forest with long gradual ups and downs; naturally, mostly ups.  The most unique part of the trail was the end approaching the Mount Rogers Visitors Center nearing Marion.  With the exception of maybe 1/4 mile of the last 2 miles, the trail was a literal tunnel of rhododendron trees, unfortunately, no blooms.  There was not much light nor breeze in the roughly 10-15’ tunnel so the ground itself was covered with wet rhododendron leaves and deep thick mud that just couldn’t dry out.  The sun beating down on tunnel from the outside increased the temperature and the humidity so the comfort level inside was decreased a bit. With the exception of bird song and the faint rolling rapids of a stream that paralleled the trail, it was wonderfully peaceful. It was a good way to end the hike and it feels kind of good to say that at 10 miles, today was a NERO, near zero.","Trimpi Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592790,"I’m not sure what’s going on exactly, but I’ve come down with something and I’m wondering if it might be Norovirus.  I’ve started feeling some of the symptoms earlier in the week and once in town, I was hit pretty hard.  While in town I’m trying to get done what I need to do, but like on the trail, I’m slow.
After a restless sleep last night I found the shuttle to downtown Marion to visit the post office to mail a package home and visit the farmers market with hopes of some fresh vegetables and/or fruit. I bought a cucumber.  There was a very disappointing number of vendors and an even more disappointing selection of fruits and vegetables.  I don’t know if this part of Virginia has much of a farming community, but they were not represented today. 
While waiting for the shuttle to go back to my hotel, I ate my cucumber.  I also walked around the downtown area and took in the sights.  Other than the farmers market, nothing much was going on in town.  There was however a recent celebration of Memorial Day that included a parade, which I didn’t see, and several hundred crosses and American flags planted along Main St., mostly on the grounds of the Smyth County Courthouse.  Each flag represents a citizen of Smyth County that served our country and has passed away. Those who died in the service of our country have flags displayed on the lawn of the Baptist church; fortunately these are only several dozen of these flags.
On a side note, but specific to hiking, hikers smell bad.  I mean really bad.  Since I’ve been in town I’ve showered, I’m clean and I smell good.  When I finally caught the shuttle back to my hotel today, there were eight hikers just off the trail and they stood out.  Perhaps if I were hiking with them I wouldn’t have noticed but because I’m clean and shiny, I noticed their funk and I felt bad for the everyday passengers on the bus.  By the way, I knew four of them and never noticed how badly they stunk.  It’s a good idea for me and all hikers to bathe or shower as often as possible. PLEASE.
I hope to be back on the trail Sunday.","

Having poorly for the last several days I wasn’t sure how far I’d feel like going today. I certainly wanted to do at least 7 miles, see how I felt before deciding to go any further.  Everyone else was looking at anywhere from 13 to 17 miles, depending on how they felt.  Unbeknownst to me and to Train Wreck to the exact degree, there was some late night socializing going on with several crews last night and the only ones that made it to the shuttle stop this morning at 8:20am were Train Wreck (TW) and me.  The shuttle driver was not socializing but even he didn’t show up even the shuttle up, so TW and I headed for the the highway, stuck out my leg and thumb to hitch a ride 6 miles out of town to the trail head.  Within 10 minutes we were picked up by the Smyth County prosecuting attorney.  Mr. Blaylock is an 11th generation Virginian; England, 1640. 
After 5 miles I was feeling pretty good so TW and I decided to separate and meet for lunch at a one room school house 8.5 miles in, where incidentally, the local methodist church stocked wooded boxes inside with trail magic.  The building was quite quaint and pretty much like every other one room school house I’ve ever seen...one room.  This one did however have two outhouses, a boys and a girls, a list of punishments in terms of “lashes” for both boys and girls and acceptable school and social behavior for teachers.  The trail magic was slim pickin’s but none the less appreciated.  TW and I ate lunch and prepared to head out when other hikers began to show up.  I was distracted by the others and sat around and visited as TW got back on the trail.  I stayed for another 40 minutes and during that time the wife of the methodist minister showed up with a resupply of trail magic...water, soft drinks, cookies, candy and protein bars, fresh fruit (!), and medical/hygiene supplies.  They restock every afternoon from April through June as a part of their ministry to hikers; there are also some devotional materials available.  It turns out that the minister of the church’s great, great, great grandfather built this school and was the first school master back in the mid 1800’s and the school was used through 1939.  Thank you West End United Methodist Church!
Before I got to the school house, I detoured just off the trail to visit a settlers museum. Though closed for the day, I walked the grounds taking photos of the various buildings and farm equipment from an era long gone and mostly forgotten.  Mrs. Lindemood believes that her father-in-law may have been born in the Farm house though not raised in it.
I caught up with TW at a stealth campsite after almost 14 miles.  It was an incredible day to hike, clear and breezy with temps in the low 70’s.  The landscape and trail conditions varied throughout the day.  Hardwoods,  towering pines, hillsides in the forest covered with ferns and vast grazing pastures with an occasional giant oak tree out in the middle and cattle scattered here and there.  The trail was a mix of rocks and roots, leaves and needles, both damp and dry and of course mud.  Sometimes the sun just can’t get in
To dry things up.  I also crossed more roads today than any other day...two track, service road, highway, rail road and I even went under Interstate 81.
Having crossed so many roads and working pastures today, places me not far at all from civilization.  As I lay in my tent at 9:30pm, there are more noises out here than I have heard on the trail at this time of night...the sound of children playing and their laughter carrying across the pastures...farm dogs barking, perhaps rounding up the cattle from the fields or just hungry and waiting to be fed...a motorcycle racing on a country backroad while a tractor trailer downshifts on the distant interstate...finally, a low flying helicopter flys right overhead, drowning out everything else.  It’s now quite.
The rest of our crew never showed up this evening, however several other hikers have so the grounds are full.  Maybe they’ve found a place earlier on the trail or perhaps they never made it out of town.  Either way, that’s how it is out here and I’m certain I’ll see them again soon.
It’s 11:00 and it’s no longer quiet. Though the children’s laughter is silent, the dogs are once again barking and the helicopter made another pass.  That can only mean one thing, MANHUNT!","Mount Rogers Visitors Center

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593463,"Well I dosed off pretty quickly last night in spite of helicopters and barking dogs.  This morning I was greeting by the songs of birds at 6:10 and they were kind enough to keep it down for another hour so I could get a bit more sleep.
Today was another great day to hike, sunny and warm though not too much breeze and it was just Train Wreck and me heading north after a quick breakfast.  We planned on about 13 miles today but ended up at 15 since the combination of flat tent sights and good water sources didn’t present itself.
The day started out up hill and continued on until the very end. There were some down hill sections but they were steep and fast so those can be just as trying and in some respects, even more so than going up.  Many people with knee issues would much rather climb than descend, just ask The Mayor.  Because there was so much climbing today and he is a bit more than half my age, TW and I separated within a mile of breaking camp and I didn’t see him again until 1:30 when I was stopping for lunch on a mountain top with a great view of the north.  Funny thing, TW was standing there admiring the view when he mentioned that he’d just finished lunch while sitting on a rock in the chilled, shaded forest about 500 yards back...bummer, but you never know where the views are going to be.  It turns out that we were going to be heading to the north and walking across those very pastures that we viewed from where I had lunch.  It’s pretty cool to look out across a landscape knowing that within a couple of hours or maybe tomorrow I’ll be standing on that mountain looking back this way trying to figure out where I came from.  Of course I’ll just have an idea based on direction of my compass since all I’ll be able to see is trees and more trees. I did suggest putting up a sign saying “you were here”.
I spent another good portion of the day hiking through pastures. The trail through one of the fields was new as it was rerouted for some reason just about two weeks ago. But the cows are using it too and leaving their “impression” at various spots along the way, so I’m sure it will be worn down to dirt in no time. The hills are rolling and surrounded by neighboring pastures that from a distance, look like well manicured lawns with miniature buildings and even smaller livestock dotting the hillsides.  Farther up the hillsides the “lawns” are replaced by a distinct line of trees whose darker shades of green continue climbing until they abruptly stop at a smoothly jagged line of brilliant blue that rolls along the contours of the mountain tops. Would this called the point where the land stops or the sky begins?
For the last few days there has been an increased presence of low lying poison ivy and poison oak along the trails, whether in the woods or the fields.  Many of the other trailside plants grow a bit taller so the vile weeds are not always noticeable.  I do my best but if I maneuver over a rock or root and feel something touch my leg, I’ll stop and see what I might have   brushed against. So far, so good.
So I mentioned that we moved on today until we found sufficient tent sites and water.  We also ran into Renoir, who left Marion a day before us.  The three of us are camped along a stream and tonight the sounds of that stream will be my lullaby.","Stealth camp site, Mile marker 547.2

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593464,"Train Wreck and I planned on a short day today and it was in terms of mileage, 8.5, but it was again uphill from the very start.  Seven hundred feet over 1 mile, 800’ down over 1 mile, reasonably flat for 1 mile then 2,300’ up for 5+ miles with very little water along the way. Since we got a late start this morning, we stopped for lunch before the big climb. The first 6 miles were through the wooded lands with the Mountain Laurels being highlighted throughout most of the day.  A few rhododendron blossoms are still holding on but fading fast as summer begins to take hold.
We eventually made our way out of the woods and onto Chestnut Ridge that for the most part was a big open field of wild raspberry bushes, flowers and grasses.  But as the horizon of the ridge rolled off, the views of the distant mountains and landscapes were amazing. Be certain to see my other journal entry for 6/6, Part 2 for some perspective.  My guidebook said that 2 miles before where I’m camped tonight is the most reliable water source for this site, so TW and I stopped to fill up all of our bottles and bladders.  I normally carry two 1 liter bottles in my pack, that’s just under 4.5 pounds and since I needed water for tomorrow too, I filled my 3 liter dirty water bladder as well and that’s just over 6.5 pounds. This I just strapped to the back of my pack where it bounced around for 2.5 miles uphill making the end of my day just a little more enjoyable.  The “reliable” water source turned out to be a rather slow trickle and with both TW and I needing water, we spent nearly 45 minutes filling and filtering in the baking sun.  Off in the approaching distance, and I mean distance, I heard two people talking. It seemed I heard them for five minutes before I even saw them.  When they finally passed me, they greeted me and explained their discussion was concerning Percival’s role in the Court of King Arthur.  As I left them at the water source to return to the trail, I could still hear their loud voices arguing some point about the Court, but never did I hear them mention Brave, Brave Sir Robin; nor did TW, as he broke into song just as the minstrels surely did so many years ago.
I’ve pitched my tent on the north end of the ridge overlooking Burke’s Garden, an 8.5 x 4.5 mile crater that turns out to be a limestone sink hole.  Historically, an ancient sea bed and home to several indigenous peoples over the years. More recently the area received its name as a joke in the 1700’s when a cook named Burke, working for a surveyor, threw out some potato peelings and when the surveyors returned a year later, the potatoes had grown everywhere.  The town now also has a thriving Amish community.  I’ve positioned my tent opening to witness what the weather promises to be a stunning sunrise in the morning.","Lynn Camp Creek campsite

Refer back to my 5/29 journal entry when I mentioned Whitetop Mountain and Mount Rogers. 
Tonight I checked into a campsite at the Chestnut Knob Shelter. The featured photo on this entry was taken from Chestnut Ridge approaching the shelter.  For the purpose of perspective on how far we hike and an appreciation for where we've been and where we're going, the black arrow points to Mount Rogers, 71 miles away by Trail, 29 miles as the crow flies.  The red arrow points out Whitetop Mountain, 79 miles away by trail and 31 point to point.  Train Wreck and I summited both on 5/29 and walked this ridge today, six hiking days later.","

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593466,"When I set up camp last night, I positioned my tent flaps such that I could unzip and flip it to the side of my tent and witness the sunrise as photographed over the town of Burke’s Garden.  As you see, the sunrise did not disappoint. I awoke at 5:57am and the sun broke the horizon at 6:04; I then fell back asleep for another hour.
The dew was quite heavy last night, both the inside and outside of my rain fly for my tent was wet and it took until 9:00 to dry it out.  I could have packed it wet but who needs the extra weight, so I don’t get out of camp until 9:45.  Still, I wasn’t the last to leave, Spoon left at 10:30 after ordering a new back pack and tent on line; he’ll have them sent to a post office in an upcoming town.  I ended up returning to camp this morning after hiking .5 mile to collect my full water bottles.  I also missed a turn on the trail after 1 mile and headed down a Blue Blazed Trail leading to a dried up water source. This detour added another mile to my day that I didn’t need to hike. In all, I walked an extra 2 miles because I wasn’t paying attention.  (These miles are not included in the 10.75 total that I officially recorded for the day, but they took a toll).
Spoon, Train Wreck and I were to meet at a stealth site on the Laurel Creek for the night, 15 miles from last nights camp.   I guess TW made it, Spoon was going for it after he and I had dinner at my camp site and of course I didn’t even try.  Though I only recorded 5.5 hours of actual hiking for the day, I am beat and was all day long. Two breaks in the morning, one of which I spoke with Cathy from high on a rocky cliff, lunch and two afternoon breaks. It was just hard to get going.  I will say that negative talk on the trail is not good. There were six hikers stopped at a gap for lunch, I had met three before, and they were all talking about how much they missed home, missed the cat, hated cooking, hated hiking, hated this or that...throw in four of them smoking cigarettes and it was a real blessing.  I was having a difficult enough day without that.  Too bad I didn’t notice Spoon off in the woods cooking pasta for his lunch, I would have certainly joined him.
Other than a lot of big rocks that I jumped to and from, the trail was unremarkable today, save the second to the last mile into camp.  The trail was crowded on both sides by walls of Mountain Laurels, just beautiful and very fragrant as well. I also saw some rhododendrons holding on as well, perhaps I’ll continue to see those as I keep heading north.
Finally, Cathy is heading down this way to see me next week.  I’m really looking forward to spending a few days together after nearly sixty days apart!","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593478,"I slept like a rock last night, 8:00pm until 6:35 this morning.  Good cool breeze blowing through my tent and it wasn’t anywhere near as damp as the night before.  I still wasn’t out of camp until after 9:00 but the day was supposed to be an easier hike, mostly flat with a couple of decent climbs.  So off I went...
It was warm and sunny, that’s like five days in a row of great weather. However as the streak grows longer, the breeze fades and that makes for an uncomfortable day.  Am I ever happy about the weather?  As soon as I turned on to the trail out of camp this morning, I started a climb.  This was the steepest of the day and lasted about two miles.  There were plenty of flat sections and the rest of the climbs were long and gradual...still, I don’t like climbing.  I also came upon a section of trail that has recently burned. I’m not sure when or if this was an attempt to contain it, but this fire did a number on the forest.
I planned to meet my crew at a shelter just after Bland, VA as they were all going into town for a resupply then heading for the shelter.  Once I came out of the woods, the trail followed a dirt road for just over 1/2 mile and where that road emptied into a state highway, I was greeted by about 15 hikers having lunch, ice cream and other snacks at Brushy Mountain Outpost.  I joined them. I ended up staying for almost 2 hours and met many more hikers coming off the trail, doing the same as I.  That was it, I was done after 11 miles today.  I was SO done, I called Zero Days Inn, a hostel and made arrangements for the night. This place is pretty far off the trail, maybe 10 miles, but there are others here that were at the outpost for lunch, so I’m not alone.  I had dinner, a shower, a shave and am doing laundry so I have clean clothes (hopefully) next week when Cathy gets down here.
I believe that I’ll slack pack tomorrow from where I was picked up and the proprietor will meet me somewhere with my full pack and I’ll take off from there, maybe find my crew.  However, Train Wreck is set on camping at Dismal Falls tomorrow night and if that’s the case, I shan’t be joining him.  I’ve heard through the trail grapevine that while the water falls at Dismal Falls are truly dismal, it has a great swimming hole and several partiers from the trail are planning a Zero there on Saturday and Sunday. This is NOT TW’s crowd!
It’s disappointing that I’ve now done two “short” days in a row, I’m just not feeling it right now.  What I am feeling is six out of the last seven days I have successfully hung my food bag over a branch 20’ up on the very first try.  That seventh day took me thee attempts because I was standing on the rope once and my depth perception was off because I wasn’t wearing my contacts and the setting sun was just right.
Weather report for the next seven days calls for 60-70% chance of rain every day.","Jenkins Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594013,"It was a quiet night at the hostel last night, a little rain but apparently none at the trail since it all seemed so dry out there.  After a quick stop at the grocers for some light weight snacks for my day of slack packing, I was dropped off at the trail by 9:00am, land from there, things started to go south.
I sat on the side of the road sorting through my stuff and after my “third sort” I realized that I was without my phone.  It had to be in the shuttle van and I had no way to reach the driver to even find out.  After 20 minutes the shuttle returned with my phone in hand and the day was looking up.  I was finally moving. Another 1/2 hour later I was finally on the trail.
The day and trail was in good shape, dry and cool. An uphill climb kept me busy for about 1/2 and hour and approximately 1 mile when I saw a huge black snake laying right in the middle of the trail...roughly 8’ long and maybe 3” in diameter. I reached for my camera and it was gone; the camera, not the snake.  So I took a shot of it with my phone and headed back to the trailhead where I was certain I left my camera and there it was on top of a guardrail bumper right where I left it.  This day was beginning to suck.
By 11:30 I had everything and was off, again.  I made it to the first shelter within an hour and since it was 1/3 mile off trail and I didn’t need any water, I passed it up looking to make up some time.  By 3:30 I had recorded another milestone as captured in today’s photo, 600 miles!  I’ll never tire of recording these moments, other than sleeping, they seem to be the highlight of my travels.
The rest of the day had me followed by a pretty nasty sounding thunder storm, though it only spit rain a little bit.  But the clouds kept the temperature in check for the time being which helped as I was steadily consuming my water supply and there wasn’t a source on the trail for 10 miles. Fortunately I arrived at a shelter with water and drank to my hearts content.  My friends Spoon and Renoir were there, Renoir was napping while Spoon was sharing his asparagus with two others, Spillson, because he spills everything and his hiking partner, JFC.  JFC is an unofficial name for “Jane From Canada” who has yet to be tagged with a real trail name.  You would think that 600 miles in you would have somehow demonstrated your trail abilities or inabilities and received a name.
As the five of us sat around the shelter catching up for awhile, we were visited by a doe. You know, a deer? A female deer? Anyway, she circled about and even allowed me to approach her to within 40’ for a picture. And as the we separated to go our own ways, the deer seemed to follow along side Renoir and me at a distance of 100’ down the side of a ridge. She stayed with us for a good 10 minutes before our trail headed off to the west.
All four of the people I met at that last shelter were on their way to camp at Dismal Falls that night.  I headed into Pearisburg and am camping at a hostel run by a local baptist church.  The facilities here are top rate and the staff just wonderful.  But the guests are allowed to “unwind” from the trail and they really aren’t holding back from partying.  I’m pretty tired and shouldn’t have too much trouble getting to sleep.","VA 612, Kimberling Creek

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594345,"Cathy left Ann Arbor this morning and made pretty good time in getting here, she arrived around 3:00pm and sat in the Dairy Queen parking lot waiting for me to descend Angels Rest, the final mountain just above Pearisburg, in the pouring rain.  That descent was pretty impressive, over 2000 feet in 2 miles.  And I won’t say it was the first time since I’ve been out here, but it certainly was the most noticeable, it took a toll on my knees.  I’m sure the rain didn’t help as it was steady the last 4 miles of my 12 mile day.
It was a pretty nice day to start off with, cool temperatures, sunny and a slight breeze that motivated me to keep moving.  The ground was wet and soft though not saturated, with the exception of trail that weaved through a very long green tunnel of low hanging rhododendrons.  Other portions of the trail offered big rocks to jump to and from, smaller rocks and roots to carefully step around, wide, well traveled paths that could perhaps support a small ATV and of course the slick mud and clay with the occasional rocks and roots that finished the day leading into Pearisburg, VA.
The trail afforded many views from high atop a running ridge line.  And with the clear skies early on, I was not disappointed.  I took a nice 45 minute lunch break in one such location and though I was sitting under a high tension power line, an unnatural and intrusive structure in such a beautiful setting, I could follow those lines down into valleys on either side of the ridge and right up the next mountain and even see the straight line cut out of the trees on the higher mountains past those.  The greens below varied in shade due to vegetation type; grasses or a variety of trees and whether they were in direct sunlight or temporarily shaded by a passing cloud.  I could have stayed longer but the bugs were a real nuisance and the clouds secretly began to gather and plot against me while I wasn’t paying attention to them.
I was by myself all day and saw no one until the top of Angels Rest. This 19 year old hiker named Rush began the trail on May 12, right after he got out of school...600 plus miles in 1 month! So far he had completed 7 days of more than 30 miles a day and expected to summit Katahdin by August 19 so he could return to school.  He assisted me by taking a couple of pictures and was off.
When Cathy saw me, she jumped out of the car, ran to me and gave me the biggest hug I can remember.  It didn’t matter that I was soaked with sweat and rain or that I was wearing a 40 pound pack, she found a way to get her arms around me and that was nice.  It was a 40 minute drive to our hotel near Roanoke and before we arrived she verbally acknowledged to me what most people at least notice when they come in contact with a hiker...”you stink.”","Sugar Run Gap, Woods Hole Hostel

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594347,"I have been posting pictures on Facebook wishing that I could be sharing some of these experiences with Cathy.  Not only the scenery but the efforts required to get from one point to the next.  So today we decided to do a little slack packing of our own.  We moved forward on the trail a bit to one of the most photographed locations on the entire AT, Mcafee’s Knob.  It was a relatively easy climb, 1200’ over 4 miles with mostly small rocks and roots to navigate. We did get to jump from big rock to big rock for a short period of time, she elevated her heart rate a bit but she handled it all so gracefully; like a natural.
Once at the top, the entire ridge was exposed and the rock platform was in some cases an overhang and in other cases a shear drop off of who knows how many miles, or feet.  We were figuratively at the edge of the world. It is by far the most amazingly impressive and complete presentation of views that I have experienced on the trail thus far.  We spent a good hour up there exploring and taking pictures, which is HUGE for Cathy as she has the most intense fear of heights that I have ever seen.  She got to within 15’ of the edge for a photo but as we were heading back down, she rethought the opportunity at hand and wanted to go back up and have solo pictures taken of her actually sitting on the edge. So we did and the pictures are incredible.  She did great.  Sitting by the pool at our hotel later in the day, she was going through her photos again and said just looking at them was making her heart race.
So tomorrow is going to be a sad day as she packs up and heads for home.  In a way, I think I would like to go with her for a number of reasons.  Either way, I’m so happy she came to see me and we got to spend some time out on the trail together.","Catawba, VA (VA 311)
",McAfee Knob,"Jun 15, Fri",4.50
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594975,"Many of you have asked about my feet and shoes.  Well it took awhile into my trip, but finally after 69 days, 400+ miles and a total of 4 pairs of shoes, I have that issue resolved!  I am no longer taping my feet like a hockey player every morning before I get out on the trail.  And although my calluses are strong and protective, they were formed in my previous shoes so it always feels like I’ve got something stuck to the bottom of my foot.
The weather has changed.  The trails are no longer a flowing torrent of cold water, rather they’re hot and dry; the perfect place for salamanders and snakes to lie still, warm themselves and surprise both prey and hiker alike.  The temperatures are well above freezing both day and night, in fact I’ve recently slept on top of my quilt and have seen more and more people hiking with as little clothing as possible, especially the men as the temps are hitting the upper 80’s so early in June.  The wind isn’t a biting 40 MPH that freezes tears and frosts breath before it even gets past the boundaries of my beard.  Instead because of all the trees now having leaves and unless you’re hiking a ridge, very little breeze gets down to the trail and when it does, its warm and probably blowing in an afternoon rain storm.  The warm weather has also affected the available water supply along the trail.  Perhaps its just certain parts of the trail, but here in VA the springs and streams are bone dry meaning that sources are separated by 10 or more miles, that means “camel up” when you come to a source.
Because I’m a notoriously slow hiker, I’ve travelled with at least 5 different groups of people.  Even people my age seem to out pace me day after day, so when I want a day off or a lower mileage day, they don’t and before you know it, they’re gone and I’m running with a new group.  But all of these people, no matter the age or the sex, are great people.  Though here for various reasons, we all have the same goal, and thats to thru hike the Appalachian Trail by the end of 2018.  Everyone out here has to deal with the same weather, the same trail, the same water, the same creatures and injuries. And while everyone does it differently we all do it together and we are all each others support day in and day out.  The obvious reward is that we witness the miracles of creation every day in every thing we see and touch.  Things that the average person can only see if they hike through a forest for several days without coming in contact with anyone but another hiker.  All the while we’re creating friendships and lifelong memories with people of different back grounds, ages, races and nationalities.  We help each other up when we trip and fall, nurse each others wounds, encourage each other when we’re having a bad day, provide a hug when we’re having a really bad day and even trade a few sheets of toilet paper for a packet or two of mayonnaise with someone who’s in need.  All of this done with people whose real names we don’t even know but know by a moniker given to them because they somehow distinguished themselves on the trail and were most likely laughed at while receiving that name.
Like everyone else, I hike all day long, go to sleep and do it again tomorrow.  One day runs into the next.  The campsites and shelters become indistinguishable from each other.  Recently my favorite part of the day seems to be going to bed and I normally sleep like a rock.  The support system that I mentioned earlier has been incredibly helpful.  In fact, I believe that if not for my fellow hikers and the encouragement of them, my wife, friends and followers of my journaling, I might have ended this attempt several weeks ago.  They say don’t end your hike on a bad day, that you’ll regret it very soon after ending it.  But honestly, I’ve not had fun out here for over a month, I’ve even taken several days off from the trail to refocus and it hasn’t really worked out.  So while Cathy was visiting me last week, we continued our talk about me ending my attempt at a thru hike and perhaps approaching it as a “section hiker” sometime in the future.  This way I can spend as much time out here as I want and complete the trail whenever I do.  With that, my summiting McAfee’s Knob on June 15 with Cathy at my side, was my final hike as an AT thru hiker.  I returned home to Michigan with her on the 16th and have been adjusting to my former “normal” life all week.  Ironically, I’m writing this while sitting alone on the beach of northern Lake Michigan, waiting for the sun to set just minutes from my campsite in Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park; so I’m still hiking and camping.
Thank you to the many who followed my journal faithfully and encouraged me to keep going, you’ll never know how much that help me push on. Please continue to check this site as I will be back from time to time with a new story or two, information of an eventual photo gallery and hopefully daily entries when the Lorax returns to the trail as a section hiker.
The attempt of the Appalachian Trail thru hike is the hardest thing I’ve ever attempted in my life.  In total, I’ve completed nearly 630 miles of which I’m proud and I’m glad I could share it with you.  I hope I kept your interest and you all enjoyed it.","

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603584,"I’m back on the trail today, first steps since June 15 with my bride Cathy, at McAfee’s Knob.  Of course this time around it’s as a section hiker heading south out of Dalton, MA. Now please forgive my writing style as it may take a bit to get back to Purlitzer quality to which you’ve become accustomed; that should come with the introduction of new characters and stories.
My old friend Tommy “Kuhn Dog” Kuhn, whom I know from my career with Inmet, now lives in New Hampshire and he agreed to meet me out on the trail (when I was in his neighborhood) and hike with me for a few days.  Kuhn Dog is an experienced hiker, though he hasn’t practiced in quite some time.  More recently he’s been training for a marathon (that’s long distance running without a bear on your tail) and considers this a good source of cross training for that event.  In addition, he and his wife Kathy, are attempting to climb the “Forty six 40’s”.  There are 46 mountains in New England that are over 4,000 feet high that they will climb, a handful of which are on the Appalachian Trail; The Presidentials in NH...look them up.  Good luck Kuhn Dog and Kathy!
Today started out cool and overcast but soon became cool and misty.  It’s possible it could have been rain from time to time, but the water falling could have been just moisture falling from the trees due to the cool wind.  But it was a comfortable day to hike.  The trail was a mix of beaten down earth either covered in pine needles or leaves of various hardwoods.  In some sections the trail was deep mud and in others deep water. In those areas the trail was elevated by 12’ planks supported by a three foot section of railroad tie at each end;  very slippery, Kuhn Dog slipped off but gracefully stepped right onto a moss covered tree strategically placed by nature about two feet to his left.
After a brief lunch/snack at Kay Shelter, we settled in for the night at October Mountain, just over 12 miles from our launch point.  We were greeted by three section hikers, “Scattered” and “The Irish Couple”.  Scattered, originally from Amsterdam, has made his home in the US for about 45 years, splits his time between MA and NC and has jumped all over the AT logging miles. His stories of the trail are plentiful and his love for America is above admirable.  The Irish  Couple are just that, a young couple from Ireland.  Starting at Katahdin several weeks ago they conquered ME, NH, VT and MA by the end of the week, at which time they’ll return home amazed at what they’ve seen and proud of what they’ve accomplished.  Lady Ireland repeatedly used words like “lovely” , “splendid” and “grand” to describe what she has seen while here.
Twelve miles was a tough day for the first day back, but I’ve done it before and I’m sure Kuhn Dog has somewhere in his hiking career.  But kudos to Kuhn Dog for pounding it out. I’m sure we’ll both sleep well tonight.","Dalton, MA

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603585,"Oddly enough neither Kuhn Dog or I slept well last night. Dog slept on a hard wood platform and was uncomfortable all night while I just couldnt fall asleep...finally 4am and awake at 730.  We were both impressed with the incredibly high winds that I thought for sure would dry up some of the water saturated trail due to Florence recently passing through.  But more impressive was the incredible rain storm that passed though beating the day lights out of the shelters steel roof.  That all cleared up to a frigid, sun shiny morning.  After 24 hours back, I REMEMBER LIFE ON THE TRAIL!  Well, not the sun shiny part.
After a not so impressive breakfast and a reload of fresh water from a tannin laiden stream, we headed south for day two.  For the most part the hike was quite pleasant and relatively flat for the first 5 miles. Of course it was still pretty moist but we experienced varied challenges like roots, bigger roots, rocks and even bigger rocks. The last 4 miles was a continuation of this terrain but uphill.  We were both frequently winded and couldnt believe how long it was taking us to reach our destination of Goose Pond Cabin only 9 short mile down the trail.  And though it was only 4 miles of the 9, I think Dog experienced a decent representation of life on the trail later in our day.
Goose Pond Cabin is an incredibly cool place.  Located on a big pond, its a rustic two story, brightly painted red building, with a big front porch and rocking chairs, no running water, no phone, no lights, no motor cars, not a single luxury. Kind of like Robinson Caruso.  It should be noted that the water on site was toted daily by canoe from a spring half way around the lake, and there is nothing better than ice cold spring water!  Upstairs in the cabin are 16 or so bunk beds and situated around the property are elevated wooden platforms for tents; very uncomfortable to sleep on without an air mattress, ask Kuhn Dog!  The care takers are Trail Magic and his wife Jiffy Pop, who like many others during the hiking season, volunteer to host and run this place.  Its beautifully located, (no roads in or out), quiet, clean and free...donations accepted.  Did I mention breakfast is served at 7am?  Well it is, cooked on a gas stove by our hosts.
Upon arrival we ditched our gear and headed for the pond to scrub off the sweat, stink and mud from todays hike. Both of us happened to misstep and found at least one of our feet somehow in the muddy water along the trail. The water was calm and ca-ca-ca-ca-cold, but on three, in we went, though ever so briefly.  (Do you recall the Seinfeld episode when George went swimming in the ocean? )  After a nice box of wine, complements of Kuhn Dog, we went outside to dine.  During and after dinner, we sat around the campfire till the wee hour of 845pm exchanging stories about bears, the trail, the Crowne Vic police cars, insurance litigation and something about A-Fib...I was doing dishes.
Although were both sore, it was a good day on the trail for hiking and experiences at a place and with people that one just cant get elsewhere in life.","October Mountain Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603586,"It just dawned on my that yesterday was the first day of Autumn and I started this southbound (SOBO) hike the day before.  I started my northbound (NOBO) hike the day before the first day of Spring.  WOW!
Both Kuhn Dog and I slept well last night and we woke up to the smell of coffee and blueberry pancakes.  I took my time preparing for the days hike while Dog checked with the caretakers as to how he and his wife could volunteer to do the same for a week sometime...the wheels are in motion!
Before leaving this morning I ventured back down to the beach to see the sun break it’s way through the overcast while a low steady mist crept along the surface of a still, grey sheet of glass.  Absolutely beautiful!
We were on the trail pretty late, 930, because we were doing a short 7 miles to get Kuhn Dog back to where he parked his car.  The terrain was pretty much consistent with what we’ve experienced so far in MA, rocky, rooty (maybe more so today), muddy and leaf/needle covered hardened dirt.  Lots of water sources due partially to all the rain MA has received lately.  I did have an incident stepping off of a fallen tree.  As I pushed off with my left foot, the tree rolled and I fortunately planted my right foot before planting my face. Unfortunately, I planted it in such a way that I over extended my Achilles, which I’ve been babying for most of the summer.
Once Kuhn Dog and I split up, the trail changed drastically for the first mile or so, it was virtually all boardwalk over water and bog/swamp.  The water was so deep that a good portion of the walk way was 3-4” under water...so much for dry shoes.  I ended up at the Shaker Campsite, named after the early settlers in the area.  A post on the Privy door described the life of Shakers as farmers and worshipers who incorporated dancing in their worship.  The same post announced heavy bear activity in the area, in fact this particular site was just recently reopened due to such.  The site consists of two elevated wooden tent platforms, fire pit, picnic table, bear box and privy.  And an out of place stone wall 50’ long by 6’ high separated the forested hill from the campsite, which is mostly cleared with the exception of several mature trees.  I did not camp alone.
We crossed paths with only four other hikers today, one was Pueblo, formerly known as Pio, heading south with a young lady named Red; they started at Katahdin in mid-July.  Pueblo and I met last spring at a campsite in the Smokies, though for only one night.  Pueblo is a young, strong hiker so I doubt that I’ll run into him again.
Other than the Achilles incident, it was another good day of hiking the AT. It was great to see Kuhn Dog again and catching up after so many years.  Thanks Tommy for joining, I hope you enjoyed yourself, I certainly enjoyed your company.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

I pulled out my down jacket, wool socks, wool hat and gloves to get through the night.  The sky was clear for a change so I actually saw the sun this morning, though it lent no warmth at all and disappeared within the hour.  My campsite mate, Grant, was gone by 730 so I was left to enjoy a nice hot breakfast of protein mix and granola on my own.  But as I was sitting at the table with my back to the forest, I heard branches break and some pretty loud snorting from behind.  I immediately started paying attention and kept my eyes pealed in all directions while I broke camp.
I spent a good amount of time stretching this morning as my Achilles was pretty stiff and though it did loosen up some, I was aware of it all day and each step was even more calculated.
Right out of the gate I had a 500 foot climb which was slow, the whole day was slow.  The AWOL guide identified a water source within .25 miles southbound on the trail but that proved to be false and I was dry.  So I ended up going 3 miles before I found a stream that produced, even though the water was heavily tannined. Fortunately a good water filter can really do a nice job of improving the taste. Once I found water, there was plenty of water the rest of the way.
I ran into several local day hikers but only two thru hikers, Cannon Ball and Zuzu, both heading north.  I met Zuzu sometime in the spring when I was heading north myself.  Zuzu got her name from “Its a Wonderful Life”, her favorite movie.
I had an occasion to talk with Kuhn Dog again today and he really saved my bacon.  I spoke with two of the local day hikers I ran into, told them I was heading into Great Barrington for the night and BOTH (!) said to hang a right at the first paved road that I crossed when I exited the trail.  So I did.  I started walking and hitched along the way, but only 4 cars passed in two miles.  The road I was on turned out to be closed due to flooding.  The next road into town was another 1.5 miles down the trail. The trail was 2 miles back. It was getting dark. It was getting cold. My phone was under 15% and I was afraid.  The trail guide that I have, AWOL, has only one shuttle service listed and that number was disconnected.  To make a short story long, Kuhn Dog came through and hooked me up with a service that got me to town.  Way to go Tommy, thank you so much!

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603590,"Today was a zero to nurse my Achilles.  I iced it last night and this morning after some extended stretching, it started to feel “pretty” good.  Still a bit stiff, but the swelling is way down.  I headed out into the rain and walked on pavement for about a mile and it held up pretty well.  Of course that’s not the trail but it’s encouraging.  Plus I didn’t have to hike in the cold, wet of the mountain trails.  In fact coming back to the motel I ran into Pueblo and Red again, they’re staying here too.  They were on the trail today and got off for fear of hypothermia, I imagine it was brutal out there.  They were kind enough to invite me to dinner tonight and I had, as I hope they did, an enjoyable evening in good company.
I will be going back on the trail tomorrow for an eight mile slack pack adventure.  Hopefully my heel will stand up to the test.  Cool weather with showers in the morning, thunder storms in the afternoon is expected. It’s the AT, what else?","

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603642,"After icing my Achilles for the last two nights, it felt pretty good. So the plan was to slack pack 8.5 miles just to see how it would hold up under the stress of the trail, even though I was carrying only a portion of my packs weight.  As I hoped, it went well.  The Achilles feels good in spite of a few slips and slides.
It rained all day yesterday until 7pm and reached only 51 degrees.  When I hit the trail this morning it was 73, cloudy, no breeze and incredibly humid.  As expected the trail was moist, in some cases very moist to the point of water flowing 2” deep.  Every surface was slippery, leaves, roots and rocks.  Which meant that every singe step had to be studied before taken.  That’s not to say that I stopped between steps, I moved at a decent pace considering my goal; 1.8 mph, a little slower than usual, but speed wasn’t my goal.  I loved the terrain today, the MA mix.  There were finally some views and I took advantage, spending a good 1/2 hour looking out over the country side as the sun fought to break through but only managed to burn off some of the fog.  I did see some sun, but being  beneath the canopy, only the occasional beam broke through, certainly not enough to dry things up.
There were plenty of sheered rock formations with impressive  vertical drops and sheets of rock surface on the trail that you would think were poured by a contractor.  These in particular were very slick.  I slipped five times, fell twice and if I’d had my full pack, would have fallen all five times and probably be off the trail due to injury.  Tomorrow I’ll be back out there with the full pack on a more challenging section, so keep your fingers crossed.
One mile of the last 1.5 ran parallel to a corn field and the trail was saturated.  The last 3/4 of a mile was between a river and corn field and the trail ran parallel to the planted corn rows.  So what?  At two places, there was an opening into the corn field where the stalks were flattened 2’ wide going into the field. That opening crossed the trail and emptied right down the river bank and into the river.  I examined the ground for animal tracks of some sort and found none.  So I can only assume this distraction was caused my the elusive Eastern Massachusetts Anaconda.  The corn field was interrupted for about 300 yards of open field where the farmer had spread manure all over the place.  The sun had come out in the low land and it was ripe!  A real olfactory treat.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603966,"Heavy rains again last night for about 4 hours, just enough to get whatever dried out yesterday wet again.  When it rains here, it really comes down! My shuttle picked me up at 9 and I was on the trail by 925.  A relatively flat first 4.5 miles and a relatively dry first 2, mostly running along meadows and cornfields with an occasional turn back into the woods.  I crossed the field where the last battle of Shays Rebellion was fought in 1787 and the trail turned to water. The trail was elevated on bog platforms (pictured) and worked its way through thick brush and what are probably flowering trees in spring and summer. These platforms are quite popular here here in MA, just in case of high water, but due to recent rains, many sections were under water or there was nothing there at all.  This area is probably a wetland normally, but the water was rushing quite quickly and I had no choice but to step off the platform(s) and wade through 6-8.  The important thing is to maintain balance and not slip or trip on anything under the surface; wet feet for the next 6 miles is one thing, but wet everything for the next 4-5 days would really, be unpleasant.  So I got through ok, the water was surprisingly cold and because I was mostly in the woods from there on out, my feet never really warmed up.  I heard the strangest sounds for about a mile this morning, coming from a distance in the north. It sounded like a single engine propeller air plane with no variation in tone or strain on its load. But that wasnt the oddest part, I also heard faint voices moaning and wailing that sounded like those heard toward the end of  Gold Dust Woman by Fleetwood Mac. Im thinking restless spirits from a plane crash!Once I got past the flat portion of my day, I began to climb; eleven hundred feet in over 2 miles. Notice I didnt say once I got past the flat, WET portion of my day.  I never got past the wet portion, water poured down the trail in streams just like it did in the Smokies last spring,  but at least this water was 50-55 degrees rather than 40!  For this 2 miles I did a lot of rock scrambling, meaning the trail was steep, the rocks were big and sharp and I was required to stow my poles while I used my hands as well as my feet and knees to lift myself up the trail...dont forget I have a 40 lb. backpack pulling be backwards (down), so my footing has to be sure and my weight forward.  Ive not yet had to do this going down, once I got to the top of this mountain, I was able to mostly walk a ridge.  Ill go down the other side tomorrow, but hopefully it will be different terrain.Because of my scrambling, my eyes were down and I ventured off the trail by about 200, though I was still on a trail of some sort, perhaps created by animals or other hikers making the same mistake.  I realized it because I saw no white blazes in either direction and the trail was getting increasingly steep and in my opinion rediculously dangerous.  So I dropped my pack and ventured back in the direction from which I came looking everywhere for a blaze.  Finally I found one, the trail turned straight up while I continued traversing the side of the mountain, which my map told me to do.  Now I made a major error that could have been costly, thank God it wasnt.  And Im not defending myself, but the trail introduced a series of short, steep switchbacks while my map showed only one and that was at the end of my maps traverse.  Additionally, the trail is very poorly marked all the way up this mountain.   Old, faded blazes either weathered, worn and moss covered need to be inspected and updated from time to time.  Still, veering off the trail is my fault.The views from the top of Jugs End were spectacular.  One just cant beat a nice sunny day on an exposed mountain top. I saw what I had already done, not whats ahead.I ran into another NOBO turned SOBO today, Forager.  I may have met him in NC, but it could also be another guy with that name.  This guy is a hammocker, the one I met was sleeping in a shelter.  I also ran into Swamp Fox, a 71 year old section hiker that completed the trail in 2017 after 5 years.  Hes from CT and likes to come back out on the trail every few weeks for a couple days at a time to refocus and give everybody a break.  Hes camping with me in the Hemlock Shelter tonight.  He also eats pepperoni everyday for the Vitamin K...WHAT?Tomorrow I expect a pretty tough day in that there are lots ups and downs in a very short distance and its supposed to start raining around 1am and continue through 8 or 9.  And not only will my highlight be getting through the day alive and hopefully, though doubtfully dry, I expect to cross over into Connecticut.","US 7 - Great Barrington, MA

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603968,"It got down to the mid-40’s and of course it rained last night, not too terribly hard, but it rained all night. In fact I’m not quite sure when it stopped because the shelter and campsite is in a deeply wooded area and water kept falling until 10 o’clock this morning. Not sure if it was rain, or water just falling off of the trees, but it was steady.
Swampfox was up early this morning and he headed out by 730. I stayed in bed where it was nice and warm waiting until it stopped raining. He decided to head north 3 miles, take a side trail 1.5 miles to a highway and hitch a ride back to his car.  He’s had enough of the rain.
1030 and I was finally on the trail, it really didn’t stop raining until after 1 or so and then it was still really damp which limited the views from the THREE mountains I climbed today. For the sake of writing it would be easy to say that one was harder than the last, but the last was the hardest, the first was basically a continuation of the one I started yesterday and the second the “easiest”.  It wasn’t so much the altitude but the altitude combined with the distance up and down, the incredibly rocky terrain and the torrential water flow over those incredible rocks.  Both up and down proved to be the hardest and probably the most dangerous I’ve come across... and I’ve not even been to upper New England!  With the exception of the .5 mile mountain top ridge line after the second mountain (that I hear has some great views), the flat part of the trail was covered in pine needles and leaves (with smaller rocks), but under a few inches of standing water.  The forest was primarily pine with not many lower branches and not much ground growth, the contour of the ground was covered with brown needles with the occasional fallen tree glowing green with moss and the rock formations, sometimes huge and sometimes small.  The thing about a pine forest is that the needle don’t rustle in the wind but I could almost always hear the sound of rushing water coming from one direction or another.  In two particular places during the last 4 miles, a footbridge was washed out and the water was so high that the large rocks used as stepping stones was under water and I was required to ford both spots.  In both instances the water was 12-24” deep, one was 15’ across and the other 25’.  The water was cold and fast and I had to move slowly in order feel what was on the river beds. I wish I could have had somebody video me crossing, this was actually kind of cool.
So you can assume my feet were soaked and cold all day and I’m sure my shoes will be just as wet in the morning, as nothing dries out over night.  There is nothing more unpleasant than getting out of warm dry camp clothes and into yesterday’s wet cold socks, shirt, underwear and shoes...I need a good period of warm sunshine and no activity to dry my stuff...or a Maytag.
I crossed in CT today though the posted picture is not of the actual border, I understand it's about 50' down river and I was heading up river.  But you get the point.

I’m pretty much hiking alone, I see a few NOBO’s and probably more SOBO’s that have flipped, but these people are fast and I’ll likely not see them again unless they take a day off soon and I catch up.  Mostly the hikers I see are day hiking with minimal packs.  I was alone at the shelter last night and I stayed inside because there were no good tent sites other than platforms and it’s hard to set up a tent securely if it can’t be tied down properly.
The sun came out this morning and the day looked promising; if it stays out, along with the breeze, things could start to dry out.  With hopes of that, I put on dry socks, though my shoes were still a bit damp, but I managed to keep my feet dry.  In places I ventured off the trail by several feet to get around a big puddle, all the while keeping my eyes open for poison ivy and oak which runs rampant out here.
A little over 9 miles today of mostly even trail but as always, lots of big rocks to maneuver over and around, at least most of the trail was drying out.  On two occasions I was blessed with spectacular views of the country side. The first was from Lionshead Mountain, pictured, which just happens to be about 3 miles past my official 700 mile marker for my total hike. (So the picture’s not completely accurate, but this is a better backdrop and much more memorable than standing next to a dead tree, right?).  I was the only person there for about 20 minutes and enjoyed a break of granola, a protein bar and cool water in total silence.  What a great 20 minutes that was!  Soon nine members of the CT hiking club showed up followed by several other day hikers, when I left there were close to 25 people up there and I passed another dozen on my way down.

Limestone Mountain Lean-to was my resting spot for the night.  It was a challenging quarter mile, only a 200’ decent but it seemed like it was straight down over, you guessed it, rocks and roots right along side a very loud, fast moving water fall.  This far into the forest and beneath a dense canopy, it was quite wet and made the decent pretty exciting...I can’t wait until tomorrow morning!  When I arrived at the camp site, all the sites were claimed by a dozen Boy Scouts and five leaders/fathers.  I stayed in the shelter with two other guys, Cat Nap and Mover.  The Boy Scouts were quite active running in and out of the woods playing flashlight tag until well after 9:00.  It wasn't until morning that I had a chance to talk with a few, particularly the three Eagle Scout candidates, but I got to spend time with pretty much all of the fathers tonight.  We, the adults, wondered around the campground looking to identify plants and mushrooms, they were oddly interested my life both on and off the trail.  These guys were mostly in their mid to late thirties and looked at what I was doing with what seemed like faint hints of envy.  Most everybody was interested in the fact that my wife LET me come out here.  My advice to them was just ""be yourself"" for the next 20 years and she'll pretty much insist that you go! Probably even drive you to the trail head :)It was nice to see and hear these boys out here in nature having fun; like I did when I was a kid.","Brassie Brook Shelter

Coming down from Lionshead Mnt. outside is Salisbury, CT, is a parking lot used by people day/section hiking that part of the trail.

After a few minor details she finally she told me his name, Raskolnikov.  ""MATT?!  From Rhode Island?! I replied enthusiastically.  Then you must be his bride from Germany?""  Both of us really surprised, we exchanged a few stories about the trail, me meeting his parents and what I knew about their recent hike together.  He had mentioned me to her at one time and he immediately recognized me from the picture (above) that she sent him.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605976,"I was right, climbing out of that campsite was tough and even more memorable than going down as I got to see the falls face on rather than looking down, back and up; this time I looked down, up and back. But once out, my heart rate was up and I was ready to go and after a big swig of the nearly ice cold water from a spring behind the lean to, off I went.  Almost immediately I was able to walk across pasture in the bright morning sun.  But as it most often does, the trail and the weather changed.  Still rocky, the trail was downhill for 2.5 miles then pretty flat for another 2.5 before entering into 7 miles of those useless PUDS.  Remember PUDS? Pointless Ups & Downs?  Well they’re still out here and they’re everywhere, everyday.  
The weather was cloudy and damp in the mountains and that pretty much saturated every thing, as it always does. While going down, I slipped on the face of a rock and landed flat on my backside.  It’s a good thing I was wearing the backpack as it really protected me from landing on a sharp rock and probably a serious injury.  And that got me to thinking that every time I’ve fallen, I've got up and collected my dignity and looked around to see just how close I’ve come to really injuring myself.  And while that would suck, what makes it suck more is that I've gone three days at a time during the last two weeks and not seen anybody else on the trail, so how is one to get help if no one passes by?
I settled into the the Pine Swamp Brook Lean to.  Two new characters enter into my story. SuSu, a 67 year old breast cancer survivor from Austin, has been section hiking for a few years with her recently deceased dog; she describes herself as the “slowest hiker on the trail”.  SuSu camps in a tent as most of us do, however she has always wrapped her food in a large compactor bag (big 3 mil plastic garbage bag) and uses it as a pillow rather than hanging it or securing it in a bear box.  For that reason I stayed clear of the campsites tonight, who needs a bear walking past my tent to get to hers?  At the shelter I met an 18 year old from SC who got his name in NC when he unknowing stepped within 2” of a coiled copperhead on the edge of the trail.  His hiking partners called it to his attention and aptly named him Blind Man.
Nine o’clock in the evening and it’s pitch black out. Everything’s absolutely quiet as it so often is this time night and this is another time when it all comes together like it’s supposed to.  Of course the tranquillity of the night ended when the whispering breeze began to raise its voice as if needing to be heard over the rumbling thunder and pounding rain on the time roof of the shelter.  As the rain continued through the night the water rolled off the roof splashed loudly into the ground puddles as though a spicket was left open.  Still, these sounds can be rather relaxing. 
The only picture I could take today was coming out of the woods first thing this morning. Otherwise, any views were obstructed by clouds and fog.","Limestone Spring Shelter

I was the last one out this morning at 9am, SuSu being the first at 7:15.  By 9:30 I passed the “slowest hiker on the trail”.  How could that be?!  Seems she headed out going north and went about a mile before realizing she’d gone the wrong way...maybe that’s why she’s the “slowest hiker on the trail”.  Anyway, I moved on and never saw her again.  The trail was again PUDS.  They were long and they were wet and I’m getting so tired of the wet.  In fact, I’ve been tired of the wet for days.  I’ve only been back out here for 11 days and 3 have been without high humidity and/or precipitation.
Two things happened today that changed my feelings about this lovely Autumn trek.  First, I planned on 10 miles today and the hike was the normal challenge.  After 6 miles the trail crossed a dirt road and dropped 200 feet fast to a stream. Once at the streams edge I found a sign stating the stream crossing was closed due to recent heavy rains and a 2 mile detour around the closure was suggested. After walking in both directions along the rivers shoreline looking for an alternate detour, I was forced back up the hill for the suggested detour. Unfortunately I was pissed off that the sign was not posted at the top of the hill and I was grumbling back up the hill in the pouring rain totally unfocused. So much so that I took another tumble, this time off to the side of the trail and I bounced a good 15’ back down the hill until stopped by a tree.  That was definitely the last nail in my 2018 hike! 
Bottom line, I’m not enjoying myself out here right now, so I’m hanging it up. I’m coming home after two weeks.  I miss Cathy and our grandson Max.  There are things I want to do at home and I want all of that more than I want this right now.  The people out here that I really like are gone and I’ll likely not see them again, especially since I don’t know who they really are.  Train Wreck, Orion, MoonPie, Mudbug, Spoon, Blue Raccoon, Forgiven and a whole cast of others that have made this adventure one that comes along only once in a lifetime.  I’ll never forget this, good times and bad.
I walked down the first mile of the suggested detour which emptied into the intersection of Rt. 4 and US 7 occupied by a hiker non-friendly Citco station.  I had the number of one shuttle service and couldn’t complete a call because there was very spotty cell service. No pay phone on the premises and the proprietor wouldn’t let me use his landline. I asked if he knew of another shuttle near by and blew me off saying he doesn’t care about this sort of thing.  I finally reached a service and was waiting outside when this ""gentleman"" told me to leave his property.  Makes me wish I hadn't purchased the mildly chilled soft drink from him...a cherry on top of a great day and epic journey.See you next spring, stay tuned!","Pine Swamp Brook Shelter

He would venture out on day hikes in to the Ocala National Forest, the southern regions of the AT and even drove to up to Tennessee for a week to join me for several slack packing excursions.  It wasn’t the summer he expected nor did he log anywhere near the miles he wanted, but he was able to support me via frequent texts concerning weather and comments of the pending trail thanks to the good folks a Guthook.  When he joined me for that week, I could tell it was killing him not to not be able to go over these mountains with me and the other hikers he met; it was like he was a 5 year old on a time-out, being told sit on the porch and watch all of his friends ride their bikes past his house!
And of course you know I, myself left the trail in mid-June due to a tweaked Achilles’ tendon and a couple of other issues at home.  Well, I am excited to announce that the Mayor and I will be returning to the AT for a limited engagement beginning April 16.  We will put foot to trail at the Narrows near Pearisburg, VA after what we hope will be an inspiring evening of trail talk and comradery with members of the AT thru hiking class of 2019, at the Woods Hole Hostel.

The bunk beds were rather short and I Had to sleep diagonally, however the Mayor was forced to sleep on the futon in the main living area.  At 1238 this morning, I got up to “go see a man” and found the Mayor wide awake staring at the fire.  At 610, I again had to “see a man”, walked into the main living area and saw him in the same position, looking at the sunrise though the window.  (That sunrise is featured with this post.) He said he did get some sleep, but what a sight to wake up to and what a beautiful day for a hike was promised us.


One of the hostel’s guest is a hiker going by the name of Hugs.  This is Hugs second stint on the AT, this time with the companionship of his guide dog named Fecteau.  Hugs aim is to help raise awareness of PTSD, a former serviceman and victim himself.  His dog by the way, is named after a Vietnam vet who tragically never returned home after being held POW. I understand that all guide dogs receive the names of fallen service men.  The organization that Hugs is working with is called PAWWS,  Paws Assisting Wounded Warriors.  Hugs agreed that I put this in my journal along with a link to his Facebook page, FECTEAUANDHUGS.  Please follow his hike and show your encouragement and appreciation for all that he and millions of other others are going through. 


After our goodbyes, we loaded into a local shuttle and were driven to the point at which I exited the trail last summer.  We scheduled a short hike of 6.9 miles, which turned out to be a GREAT idea.  It was mostly up over a terrain that was mostly rocky and rooty covered with dead hardwood leaves and sticks that had fallen due to recent heavy rains and high winds.   The larger debris had been cleared by local trail maintenance teams, even the white blazes were a bright white from a fresh coat of paint in anticipation of the hundreds if not thousands of people that will enjoy Virginia’s Appalachian Trail.


Today’s hike proved to be challenging for both of us and most certainly me.  The Mayor is 6’3 and has a pretty decent gait, so it made sense that he take the point.  His knees seemed to hold up to the challenge today, though there weren’t many descents.  I seemed to have lost both my trail legs and lungs while I fought to keep up.  Probably because of me, we were passed by several hikers, mostly in they’re twenty’s, but a few recent retirees as well.  For some reason the “kids” did only 7-9 miles as well and are camping with us here at Rice Field Shelter, but tomorrow are looking to do around 25 miles.  I mentioned to the Mayor and a young lady that’s here now and stayed at Woods Hole last night, that based on today’s performance, I should change my trail name to “Keep Right” since I was so frequently passed.


Small world.  Just shy of this mountain top and camp site is a piped spring.  (The trail maintenance people insert a black pipe into the ground and fresh mountain spring water flows freely.  When you find one fill all your bottles because nothing’s as good as fresh, clean and cold spring water.)  Anyway, the Mayor took off and I waited for a hiker I saw coming up the trail just behind us.  After introductions, he is “Lone Star” from Greenville, TX, he stopped in mid sentence, repeated my name, Lorax, and asked who I knew that worked at L3 in Torrance, CA.  I know several, or at least did, but the name Bob Tobin jumped out and that’s exactly who he was thinking of.  Bob mentioned to Lone Star that I was out here and directed him to this sight.  Thanks Bob and congratulations Lone Star on your recent retirement and good luck on you AT adventure!


The sky now plays host to an early full moon that currently out shines the stars, as it’s still rather early. But our day ended with a sky just as beautiful as the one we started with.  We’re both exhausted from the day and am certain neither of us will have trouble sleeping tonight.","Narrows, VA

Today was a long day and a lot of up hill; slow, steady and painful.  Painful in that I’ve yet to gain my breathing seems labored again due to the altitude but this time around it’s the humidity, and I’m sure it will get tougher as the miles pass.  There was a good 9-10 mile stretch that had no stated water sources on any of the hiking guides.  Fortunately I was standing in the middle of the trail catching my breath and noticed vegetation to my left, about 50 feet off the trail. While looking for a place to drop my pack, a previous hiker built a small cairen and made a “W” with an arrow pointing to the source, thank you!  The Mayor and I each had about 1/2 liter left and 6 miles to go so the refill was certainly welcome. We each drank a liter before we stocked up and continued on.  A 2 mile down hill approach to the shelter took a toll on the Mayor, but the switch-backs made it a bit easier for both of us.


We arrived at the shelter around 6 pm and with no quality camp sites available, we ended up in the shelter for the night with 6 others, only two of whom we’d met before...Pa, who retired three weeks ago and a 23 year college student from FL and Ottawa who got her name Crock Pot because she hikes slow and steady.  


Most of the people were meeting out here are in their 20’s and 30’s and are logging some serious miles.

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611068,"After two rather hot sunny days of hiking, you know that the weather will turn, and this morning it did.  Pretty impressive thunder and lightning rolled in around 7 or so and lasted a couple of hours.  Not certain how long it would last, we sported our rain gear but quickly removed it because the temperatures started to rise as soon as the sun came out.  It did rain hard enough to move the leaves and twigs to the side of the trail in places and create some mud holes that we had to work through.  


Today’s hike was up as soon as we put foot to trail, Six hundred feet in in about a mile and half.  The trail of course was soft, cover in hardwood and rhododendron leaves.  The living rhododendrons that lined the trail are healthy with very tight blooms expected to make an appearance in mid-May.  But the leaves captured water droplets that looked like little gem stones of various colors as I moved past and the sun shown through the canopy.  The small spruce trees presented in a like manor.  Every once in awhile the breeze would blow just enough to knock some droplets from their perch and down the back of my hot, sun soaked neck.


Neither the Mayor or I had much energy today and that resulted in a 4 mile day.  We settled into Bailey’s Gap Shelter sometime mid-afternoon and set up camp in said shelter because again, no quality camp sites.  We were eventually joined by 3 other hikers, JuJu and his father, Mosey and a SOBO without a trail name...Allen, I think.  We’ve all been in bed since 730 with a strong cool breeze and a promising sunset over our shoulders.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611069,"Good Friday.  Last year at this time I was climbing Tray Mountain, further south on the AT.  Today wasn’t as pleasant as weather goes, but I’ll get to that.


It was quite breezy all night but not too cold.  The moon, still looking full was lightly covered by hazy clouds, though not enough to block its light.  We awoke to a quick rain shower around 5am just as JuJu and Mosey we’re heading out.  The rest of us stayed tucked away for another two hours.  It wasn’t raining but we’d heard that storms were predicted for much of the day so our rain gear was handy, and it wasn’t long before we needed it.  Hiking in the rain for me is tricky in that I’m going to get wet from perspiration anyway.  But the wind can make it even colder, so I’ll wear my rain jacket and just deal with it.  Whether it was raining or not, the wind blew strong and cold all day long.  When we crossed Wind’s Knob at 4100 ft, gusts had to be approaching 40 knots. That’s the time to get back into the woods as quickly as possible, though bare trees provide little shelter.


The condition of the trail today varied.  Parts well worn and smooth, but mostly rocks.  Big rocks. And they were wet.  It was virtually all up hill until a very fast, steep downhill to the shelter.  A reasonable amount of rain would have turned this trail in flowing river, making it unimaginable to navigate safely.  Fortunately, the Mayor and I beat the rain that would turn the trails into such a nightmare, but it did rain quite hard for the last 2 miles.  We arrived in camp at 230 or so after logging 12.5 miles and we were soaked.  We were greeted by two young brothers, Rosebud, a 23 yr. old teacher and his little brother Peewee, a recent high school grad, both warm and cozy playing cards.  Over the next couple of hours the rain became relentless and two more gents rolled in looking cold and relieved to find shelter.  Lone Star (not the one from earlier this week) and Space Rock are now dry watching the rain pour down with the rest of us.  Wow, is it ever raining hard!","Bailey’s Gap Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611083,"Happy Easter everybody!  Yes, I missed yesterday, but here’s an update...


The weather was still threatening on Saturday morning with the temperatures expected to drop.  Given that Sunday was Easter and we wanted to go to church, and we wouldn't have a chance to get off the trail for another 4 days after today, we decided to come into town and regroup.  Unfortunately there has been no cell service for week and in the gap where we exited the trail, it was no different.  We walked down the road a piece and found a country gent at his hunting lodge who let us use his phone.  (The sign above his door read “empty weapons before entering”...but it didn’t say how!). After an hour or so, our shuttle driver picked us up and brought us back to the same town, Pearisburg, where we started earlier in the week.  The rest of Saturday included laundry, resupply and Chinese buffet...pretty much like any trip to a town.


This morning, Easter, and like hikers do, we walked into town to go to church at the most popular denomination in the south, Baptist.  On our way up the driveway we passed a bus that we assumed to be the church bus. As we approached, the Mayor struck up a conversation with the man in the drivers seat. He and another man eventually got off the bus and were telling us about this ministry, Ambassadors of Heaven.  This group of 14 men are recovering addicts, alcoholics and recently released convicts that travel this area of Virginia ministering to men of their kind.  They were visiting this church today as well.  After talking with the drive and the minister for a while, we were invited on the bus to meet the men and hear some of their stories.  Now some of you might be thinking ""not a good idea, what's the matter with you guys?"" but The Mayor and I boarded the bus and met the guys who were all receptive to what we are doing on the trail.  We sat down for about 20 minutes and listened to a couple of the men’s stories and I was pretty touched with how low a man can get and what faith in God can do in his life.  When we got off the bus, these guys were singing a song and hugging each other.  We got a picture and fist bumped everyone before heading into the building and once inside, the singing didn’t stop.  They were standing up, raising their hands and sometimes talking back to the preacher as he spoke, which I don't believe is common Southern Baptist protocol.  Every once in a while the preacher looked over at them with a little smile but never missed a beat.  Anyway, today was a good day and like everyday on the trail, you never know who you’re going to meet, what their story is or what brings that person to where they are in life.  Tomorrow they could be sitting on a rock or a fallen tree, but today they were on a bus.


We’ll be back at it tomorrow morning as the weather is expected to warm up again and we've got a nice mountain to climb right out of the gate.","War Spur Shelter 
",Rocky Gap,"Apr 21, Sun",2.80
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611947,"Up early this morning.  Don the shuttle driver had a busy day, so our time slot turned out to be 715 and we were back on the trail by 8.  
The day started out overcast and cool and by the time we got to Rocky Gap it was clear and cold. I was wearing my rain jacket to beat the chill and the Mayor was layered up like he always is to start the day.  The climb out of the gap was a short, steep one on a relatively simple overgrown fire trail with lots of rocks and ruts from years of neglect and erosion.  Two miles in landed us at Kelly’s Knob, an absolutely beautiful rock formation towering high above the sun soaked landscape with views from the southeast to the northwest.  I was able to receive a cell signal and tried to make a few calls, none of whom were available, except Cathy!  We FaceTimed from the mountain top so she got to see what I was up to this morning.  I think she enjoyed it.
Coming off the mountain of course meant down.  It was not so bad, but it was fast and that can take a toll on the knees.  This is what knocked out the Mayor last year and I can feel it beginning to stress mine as well...slow and steady.
About three miles of today’s hike was through rolling pastures.  Coming out of the forest, no matter how little foliage there is and into a pasture, raises the expectations because of the contrast in light…what is waiting for me over that hill?  This particular pasture was guarded by the oldest oak tree on the southern Appalachian Trail, aged at roughly 300 years old; it’s huge!  But once past this tree we were into the pasture where the sunshine intense.  And while imaginable, the colors were unexpected and therefore, unimaginable. The grass, a bright, nauseating green with varied species of trees offering an accent of darker greens.  Specks of pink and white blossoms here and there accented the waves of Golden Rod wild flowers climbing the hillsides.  Property lines are geometrically defined by dark, well kept rail fences that continue on until the line they create abruptly turns 90 degrees in either direction and head up or down another hillside.  Many of the houses and outbuildings that pepper the countryside appear to be well maintained and are easily identifiable from a distance by the distinct, brightly colored steel roofs that they don.  All of this, held in place by a clear blue lid screwed on so tightly that nothing could possibly escape. The only thing missing was livestock; they were spotted high on a distant hill minding their own business, but proof of their nearby and frequent existence is abundant on the ground and sometimes in the air.  One can’t walk away from such a sight without returning a repeated glance over the shoulder just to see how it may have changed with distance.  And it really hasn’t.  The impressiveness remains and the aw grows greater as the small individual glimpses began to fit together as if assembling a puzzle and views for miles and miles start to make perfect sense.
Once leaving the pastures, we were back in the woods and of course going up, 1300’ over about 2 miles of rocky switchbacks that were exhausting on this poorly shaded, sun soaked mountain side.  But once on top we were rewarded with a mile long walk along a ridge top with splendid views to both the east and the west.  The trail weaved its way through several dozen piles of rocks as farmers from long ago might have done when clearing a field for crops.  But this is a rocky ridge and the trees appear to have difficulty establishing a sound root system, how could one expect a productive crop?  For the most part the rocks appeared to be carefully stacked, but one pile in particular was done by hikers or visitors to the ridge.  It was a neatly stacked conical pile roughly 8’ high and perhaps 6’ in diameter. It was positioned in a clearing at the edge of the ridge facing east, as though it were a posted sentry. At the end of todays ridge is a “T” in the trail.  Our destination for tomorrow is to the left and home for the night was to the right, Savern Hollow Shelter. The shelter is quite nice with a big covered porch and picnic table, but is about1/2 mile off the trail and down several hundred feet from the ridge line.  Materials had to air lifted to get them in here, there’s no other way to do it.  (It’s going to be a bear to climb out of in the morning!). The water source is a spring another .1 miles downhill.  But right next to the spring is the ruins of an old homestead including a couple of out buildings.  The house appears to be a two story log cabin, totally collapsed with the exception of two stone fireplace/chimneys, one on either side of the doorway.  The hand hued logs of the nearest outbuilding were still standing one three sides.  A 4"" gap separated each log and there was no trace of any chinking; it's interesting how different modern log cabins are from those of this time period.
About an hour after lights out (sunset), we were awaken by a very loud bird.  Normally owls, Bard and Screech, can be heard for miles.  But tonight this bird produced a very loud whistle consisting of five tones but only three notes.  This was repeated over and over and over again for nearly 1 minute without seemingly taking a breath. After a 20 second break, it started again.  Curious, the Mayor got out of bed and went to the edge of the shelter’s porch to investigate and it started still again, this time it was very close, as if say directly to the Mayor,“I dare you to step off that porch.  Go ahead, see what happens”.  Well he didn’t but we'll see if he's still here in the morning.  The bird kept up its song for a total of 5 or 6 minutes.
The moon seems to have taken the night off, at least the early shift.  So that leaves the darkness for the stars and they didn’t disappoint.  We'll have to enjoy them now because in 2-3 weeks the canopy of leaves will block them from view.","Rocky Gap
",Sarver Shelter,"Apr 22, Mon",9.40
Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612701,"Early this morning the moon showed up for the late shift and and was hard at work fading out the starlight by 330.  And that whistling creature showed up again around 5. This time it sang for even longer periods though still a total of 5 or 6 minutes.  One of the campers, Dharma, told us it was a young whippoorwill that really didn’t have the song down yet.  Once learned, she said they can go on for up to 45 minutes.  The Mayor named her Whippoorwill and she gladly accepted.
The climb out of last night’s shelter was everything it promised when we went in.  Eight switchbacks, 400’ and 15 minutes later we were out and on our way.  The guide made it look like a pretty simple hike, 3 miles of ridge line and a 3 mile descent to the next campsite.  Well the ridge was beautiful as we hiked pretty much due north along the Jefferson National Forest boundary.  Every once and a while we’d see survey markers which up there are 3 inch pipes driven into the ground with a mushroom type cap on top.  To the east was the forest, all trees clear over to the parallel ridge line a couple of miles away and beyond, as yesterday's featured photo showed. To the west were farmlands with the occasional wooded plot here and there.
The ridge was basically a series rock faces laid on top of one another at every angle imaginable, but mostly vertical.  Often my poles were stashed under my arm as I used my hands to help pull me up and stabilize the climb.  This type of hiking takes its toll on the ankles, feet, knees, hips and everything in between because of the angles at which the foot is planted.  In addition, it was hot today with no breeze and no shade.  We were fortunate that we crossed in the morning when it was only in the 70’s, other hikers crossed in the mid-afternoon and had even worse temperatures.  I can’t imagine climbing these rocks in mid summer when the temps are consistently 80+ degrees and heat is be dissipating from them as well.  The guide book also states this ridge as the Eastern Continental Divide, you can Google that.
We finally arrived into camp mid-afternoon, retrieved water, fixed dinner and decided to just settle in for the night.  This six miles was pretty tough on us.  Throughout the afternoon/evening 14 other hikers and 2 dogs showed up,  all young people in the their 20’s and all doing between 18-30 miles a day. All but 5 moved on.
It’s just after 8, everyone’s in bed and the sun has gone down as expected.  It’s still quite warm and not much breeze, I hope I don’t have too much trouble sleeping.  No sign of the moon yet but plenty of stars and it appears this gap has a number of singing night birds, including the whippoorwill; they’re whooping it up from every direction and they’re adults too, so they’re getting the song right.","Sarver Narrows Shelter

Lorax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612753,"I had a rough time sleeping last night, it was warm but that’s probably not the reason.  Oh well, there’s always tonight.
I was last out of camp today, the Mayor was gone 10 or 15 minutes before and I didn’t see him for the next 3+ hours.  It was a pretty easy hike out of the campsite this morning, relatively flat and basically a dirt path through a nice section of pine trees.  I thought I’d do the 2 miles in about 40 minutes but it took 55...I just don’t understand how people are doing 3-3.5 MPH.  I know I’ll get better, my legs are coming along, but come on, this was the easiest terrain I’ve seen yet.
The climb up Brushy Mountain was slow and steady, yet still quite warm.  I’m trying to hydrate some every 15-20 minutes, which means I go through the water pretty fast.  On top of the mountain I caught up the Mayor sitting at the Audie Murphy monument talking with Trout Lilley.  Ironically, she and I met last summer on Chestnut Knob, further south in VA. She’s section hiking and currently piecing together VA.  Audie Murphy by the way, died in a plane crash near that site.
The hike down Brushy Mountain was pretty easy, it was 5 miles of long gradual switchbacks through recently burned and newly green forest.  It's been roughly 9 miles without a water source and I was out by the time I reached the bottom.  fortunately there was a stream and I was able to refill before starting the next 1.5 miles up the next mountain to Pickle Branch Shelter where we set up camp for the night.
Once in camp we met a couple of other guys, Paris and Scooch who camped with us.  And around 930 pm two other hikers rolled in showing little concern for lights out, using their outside voices, banging things around at the shelter and using the phone as a flashlight.  Trail etiquette says use a red light in camp which all hiking headlamps have and every single hiker I’ve met uses.  
Now fully awake, I'm laying here waiting to fall back asleep.  It appears that one of these guys will be sleeping on the picnic table under the stars and he is snoring quite loudly, adding to my inability of going back to sleep.","Niday Shelter
