Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588189,"First off, my twin grandchildren were born last week. What a couple of cuties! My daughter and her babies are doing fine. By June, they'll be walking and talking and I'll be hiking SOBO.
I am making a concerted effort to lighten my load. I have switched out my old ULA P-2 pack I bought in 2004 for a ULA CDT. It's about 2 lbs lighter. My old pack served me well in my NOBO hike in 2013&2014, but is worn out. I bought a Marmot Down defender sleeping bag that is a pound lighter than my old bag. And I will be getting a Tarp Tent Pro Trail to replace my Hennessey Hammock. That is almost 2 lbs lighter. I switched out a under armor fleece with a pull over stretch material top, and replacing my rain pants with a kilt. Right now my base weight is 15 lbs, down by 5 lbs in 2014. I am making a lot of miscellaneous adjustments that I am picking up from YouTube vids. Counting the days to start hiking SOBO in June.",,View Entry,"Apr 27, Fri",0

Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594842,"Got up at 4:45 am and drove to West Palm Airport. Got to Bangor at 1 PM
 Then I waited 5 hours for the bus to Millinocket. Believe me there is very little to do at the Bangor bus station for 5 hours. Since I had to carry my pack everywhere, I just cooled my heals and waited it out. I found a park about 5 blocks from the bus station. It was better to get some fresh air than looking at the floor in the station. Anyway,  after an hour bus ride I got to Medway, where I was picked up by the AT Lodge. Tomorrow, they will shuttle us to Baxter SP, where the fun begins. The lodge is full, a lot of hikers will be on the mountain tomorrow.","Home

Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596173,"Started the day with a shuttle from the AT Lodge to Baxter State Park. Picked up a day pack at the ranger's station and started up the mountain. First section was a slight incline that got steeped as I got closer to the tree line. Above the treeline, it was a boulder climb to the gateway, a small level area. The another steep stretch up an arm of the mountain to the tablelands, a relatively flat moonscape with Thoreau Springs in the middle. Then a final ascent to Baxter Peak, the highest point on Mt Kahtahdin. 5 hours up and 5 hours down. By the end my back & knees were hurting, just on long day of climbing.

After crossing a river, I started a climb over a 500' hill that just exhausted me. I got dehydrated due to the heat and humidity. Finally, I sent a SOS out on my SPOT device. Some EMT's gave me an IV and drove me into town. I was about 5 miles outside on Monson, near Little Wilson Falls. Everyone is complaining about the heat and humidity.  Tomorrow will be a rest day and then I am driving to Arcadia National Park for some day hiking. My 2018 AT hike is over.","Wilson Valley lean to.
