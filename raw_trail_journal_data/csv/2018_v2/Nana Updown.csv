Nana Updown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583379,"Becoming a bit anxious to start making the boxes my friends will be mailing to me filled with food and new clothes. Most of my supplies have been purchased/made, just need to pack them!",,AT,"Feb 27, Tue",0
Nana Updown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587213,"we arrived in GA last night. Jen is sick from the grandson, hoping she feels better as the day progresses. We are still at the hotel and have a few errands to run before we actually head to the trail. I can’t believe we are actually doing this. The house is empty and the storage unit is full. No going back now!",,Maine,"Apr 19, Thu",0
Nana Updown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587264,"Jens illness kept us from the trail today, moved extra slow today, which is fine, due to the stress of moving an entire house to storage and saying goodbye to everyone. She has been such a trooper with how sick she is, if it was me, I’d be unable to even move. It’s amazing we even made it from Atlanta.",,AT Springer MTN,"Apr 19, Thu",0
Nana Updown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587695,"Well, we figured our first 0 day would be in Hot Springs, NC, but due to the weather, Jen recovering from the flu (and I started to feel a little sick yesterday morning) that it was best if we got off the trail yesterday. We hiked 15 miles yesterday into Neel's Gap, the last five miles were in sleet and rain, up Blood Mountain. I am super proud of Jen and amazed that she continues this hike despite getting over the flu, at times she is unable to speak because her voice is gone and I am actually in the lead up mountains (this is unheard of as Jen is much faster going up than myself).It is supposed to rain for the next several days and we decided last night we would take a 0 day today, wash our clothes, and stay out of the high winds and rain. We have met some interesting people along the way, Penguin who is from the UK, I hope to run in to her again, Scrapbook a 20 year old who has already hiked the PCT and CDT.Jen's trail name is Nana Troll due to bringing along trolls to place in trees and send pictures to our grandson. My trail name is Nana Updown- because as a hiker all you do is go up and down mountains and because our grandson says ""updown"" when he wants to turn the lights off and on.I'm feeling pretty good about the weight of my pack and my ability to pack it well. We are likely going to have a ""shakedown"" before we get back on the trail- this is when a staff member/hiker at Neel's Gap outfitter goes through all your stuff and tells you what to get rid of and how to save on weight.I miss my family and my dogs. We have come across dogs on occasion during this hike and I always go to pet them and tell their owners about Barkley and Clancy and how we had to leave them (in very good hands of course) for six months. I am truly grateful to my parents who have Barkley and Paul and Joyce who have taken on Clancy.I guess that is all I have to write at this early of an hour.","AT Springer MTN

Nana Updown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588402,"We did it, today we reached mile 100. 109 to be exact. Climbing Albert Mountain to see the beautiful view of North Carolina was amazing. The trail today looked a bit New Englandish, which was a nice reminder of home.
The trail the past couple of days has not been too strenuous, although Albert MTN has a bit of a scramble, it wasn’t that way for long. With plenty of switchbacks and gradual incline, getting to the top of Standing Indian MTN yesterday was a pleasant climb.
While I continue to go much slower uphill, I have been able to find a nice, steady pace that doesn’t kill me and allows me to get to the top without stopping. We did not run into any of our known fellow thru hikers today, but we did speak with several section hikers. Came upon some trail magic at the base of Winding Stair Gap, sweet! 
No significant aches, sores or injuries. Missing Barkley and Clancy a lot today. I’m so excited to be on this adventure and to be doing it with my soulmate. Looking forward to seeing family again, including my grandson, Cam.","AT

Nana Updown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589619,"So, today we left Gatlinburg, TN to head back on the trail. To catch everyone up, we have been going pretty hard at the trail and finally took our second zero day. Due to the need to stay in shelters while in the Great Smoky Mountains we have been doing 13+ miles a day, and did 17.9 miles over Clingmans Dome into Gatlinburg.
We have hit another rainy spell and was unable to get a great view on Clingmans Dome, although plenty of great ones on the hike up. So much wildlife in the Smokies. We saw a bear, not very close! We have had deer eat 10 feet from us. Birds singing and chirping all day long with chipmunks running around nearby. ","AT Springer MTN

Nana Updown,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590340,"We made it into Hot Springs, NC two nights ago and just finished our second 0 day in a row for a grand total of 4 0 days. We wanted to take advantage of the mineral waters (hot springs) while here, hence two days in town.For those of you who would like to have a tv, internet fans laundry services in the same place, Hot Springs might not be for you. Luckily our friend Penguin caught up to us and we can all catch up (Braveheart, too).We have been doing about 16-18 miles a day, depending on the terrain and how we are feeling. My plantar fasciitis has been acting up a bit, however I have been able to cope this far. Trying a new pair of insoles and hoping they help. There have been great views, especially on Max Patch, and we have walked through some nice forests. Hammocking remains great and we have not had to set up in the rain since the Smokies. No more bears or deer, however a few snakes, newts and other creepy crawlers (millipedes). This has been an amazing trip thus far and I am still happy to have chosen to go on this trip.","AT Springer MTN
