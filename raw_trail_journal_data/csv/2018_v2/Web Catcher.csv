I keep looking at my gear and asking myself...""is it all going to fit in my pack and can I keep my weight (base weight plus consumables) under 30 pounds?A big ""kudos"" goes out to my husband, James, who will be supporting me on this journey! James, I love you and you ROCK!",,View Entry,"Apr 03, Tue",0
Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586754,"The day began with excitement and a little anxiety. I was concerned about the 600+ steps leading up to the top of the falls at Amicolola Falls State Park. So in the interest of ""Hike your own Hike"" (another way of saying take it at your own pace), I decided to walk down the stairs where James met me with my pack. After the traditional photo under the archway and the stamping of my AT passport, it was a short drive back to the top of the falls.
Here James surprised me with my all time favorite treat, 5 Snickers Bars. Later in the day I was forever grateful to have them! We shared hugs and kisses and said our teary goodbyes. I must admit that is was a very lonely feeling as I waved and watched James drive out of the parking lot while I walked up the trail!
Shortly after stepping onto the trail I met three lovely ladies (Susanne, Leanne and Rachel) who asked me about my hike and were very excited to meet a ""thru-hiker."" They really cheered me on and helped alleviate some of the anxiety I was feeling. These ladies would be the first of many wonderful people I met throughout the day.
The day was grueling! None of the many training hikes I had done in the previous year and a half prepared this Florida ""flatlander"" for what was to come! I spent the day intently watching the trail and my foot placement so as not to stumble over the many rocks and roots. The day consisted of MANY, small breaks to catch my breath and let other hikers (both north and south bound) pass me by. Many times through out the day I'd keep telling myself...""just give me 50 paces"" then ""50 more."" By late afternoon I was so grateful to have one of those Snickers bars in easy reach. It was just the energy boost I needed to get me further up the mountain! I remember coming through the large open area at Nimblewill Gap and starting up the other side, only to look up and see a endless sea of rocks the size of basketballs and larger that seemed to go on forever. Oh well, nothing to do but keep moving onward and upward!
I made it to Black Gap Shelter shortly after dark, arriving to a sea of tents surrounding the shelter. Too exhausted to set up my tent, I was hoping that there would still be room in the shelter. I arrived to find that the shelter was empty. When I saw a lone mouse scamper across the shelter floor and up the wall I understood why. Too tired to care, I hurriedly ate a cold dinner, stored my food and ""smellables"" in the bear box near by, blew up my sleeping pad, laid out my sleeping bag, changed into sleeping clothes and prayed as I laid down that the mouse would not chew any holes in my pack or gear! Thankfully, all my gear was intact the next morning.","Amicolola Falla State Park

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586757,"I awoke this morning to rain and very sore calves, thighs and back. It was definitely a slow start! My initial planning goal was to make it to Hawk Mountain Shelter but I knew this was not to be...not today.
The climb up Springer was steady with many short stops to stretch out the legs and back. Even as tired and sore as I was, it was exhilarating to be atop Springer Mountain and finally about to begin my journey on the Appalachian Trail! I spent time atop Springer listening to Sam, Firefly (a 2016 thru-hiker), and others talk about their journeys. A man I met the previous day asked if I had seen his friend Sam on my climb up, which I had not. His friend Sam was in severe pain from climbing the stairs and the approach trail the previous day. He was not sure if Sam would be able to continue his hike. We all talked about how people should be warned about the stairs and approach trail.
I arrived at the Springer Mountain Shelter shortly after 2 p.m. It was very slow going setting up my tent, gathering water, attending to camp chores and preparing an early dinner. I must say the people are great. I enjoyed meeting and talking with a young couple out for few days of hiking. They were kind enough to share their dark chocolate covered fruit and I in turn shared my hot chocolate. I also enjoyed meeting a Deputy with Polk County Sheriffs Office (it is amazing how many people I am meeting that are from Florida).
There was an older gentleman that set up camp on the site next to mine. Occasionally, I would hear him grumbling...""I'm to old for this sh**"" as he set up camp and I would chuckle to myself thinking that the way I was feeling that I was right there with him! By dark most were in their tents and snores could be heard around camp. I understand now why they say 9 p.m. is a hiker's midnight!
The next morning as I was trying to get moving, I chuckled to myself again as I heard my camp site neighbor grumble...""I'm to old for this sh**""!","Black Gap Shelter

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586812,"I continue to be moving very slow when it comes to breaking camp and heading out on the trail. My back is very sore this morning and have been dreading donning my pack. I spoke with Firefly this morning and she suggested that I secure my tent to the center of the back of my pack instead of on the left side. It seems that uneven weight distribution may be causing me to over compensate on one side leading to a very unhappy back!
It was another very short mileage day today and somewhat discouraging, but I'm learning that I have to listen to my body. I'm just not up to the higher milage days yet but I know that it will come one day. I understand now why others have been saying that all of the pre-planning goes out the window when you hit the trail! 
The soreness and pain aside, the sun was out and it was a glorious day for hiking! I experienced my first trail magic at Big Stamp Gap. Ron ""Yellow Blazin"" (one of the local shuttle providers) drove up and was handing out tootsie pops and Gatorade packets. He gave me a tootsie pop and also offered to take my trash out so I would not have to pack it out. That tootsie pop was the sugar boost I needed to get me up the mountain. Thank you Ron!
One of the highlights of today was getting my first taste of the ""green tunnel."" This is an area of the trail where the wild rhodadendrens and mountain laurels grow in a canopy over the trail. Although they were not in bloom yet, I can just imaging how beautiful it will be when they do bloom. Atleast it was lush, green and nice and cool hiking through this part of the trail. Another high light was seeing a sky full of stars later that night. What a stunning display of stars!","Springer Mountain Shelter

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587057,"I woke up concerned about the distance to the next shelter. No matter how much stretching I do, the back pain will not let up. My back up plan was to stop at the tent camping area just prior to Hawk Mountain Shelter. 
It was another beautiful day for hiking. I still have not mastered the clothing layers. Often times I find myself getting over heated while hiking in multiple layers and a rain jacket. Guess I will figure this one out as I go. I stopped for a nice lunch break at the foot bridge at three forks. The sound of the running water from the stream was so relaxing and the cool breeze was just to inviting to pass up! Several of the hikers on the trail had the same idea and enjoyed breaks at this spot as well. Shortly after resuming my hike I met ""Late Bloomer"" a 70 year old gentleman attempting a thru-hike. What an inspiration! Later in the afternoon I met up with a father and son team taking a break on one of the long up hill climbs. I must have looked pretty worn out because this gentleman offered to assist me with taking my pack off if I cared to rest. I REALLY appreciated the gesture but told him that if I took my pack off, I wasn't sure I'd get it back on...LOL! Thirty four pounds on your back gets pretty heavy after a while! I was able to get a phone signal, during this break, and called home. That is always uplifting!
Finally made it to the tent camping area by late afternoon. It was a long downhill walk till I found the perfect site...half way to the water source and close to the bear box for storing food and ""smellables"" that evening. It was a long day and I opted for a cold dinner and water collection before calling it a night. The father and son team I met earlier in the day were my camping neighbors and I shared some chocolate covered fruit with them that another hiker had gifted me with at a previous shelter. It made me feel good to ""pay it forward""...hope they enjoyed the goodies. Shortly after crawling into my sleeping bag for the night, I could hear a helicopter and gun fire in the distance from the Army Rangers practicing maneuvers in the mountains. A few Barred owls, very close to where we were camping, graced us with their hooting and calls during the night. It was another beautiful star filled sky tonight. You definitely don't get these views back home!","Stover Creek Shelter

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587078,"So this is the day I ""tanked"" on the Appilachian Trail! Sleep was very sporadic last night and the back pain just about unbearable this morning. It was a long uphill climb out of the tent camping area and back up to the AT. Lesson learned...""What goes down must come back up!"" Next time I will pick a tent site much closer to the actual trail (LOL).
By the time I reached Hightower gap there was nothing left in the tank so to speak. I was feeling extremely weak, had the shakes and the back pain had gotten the best of me. ""Stepping Wolf"" (a hiker I had met at a previous shelter) came up the trail as I was leaning up against a stump in the middle of the trail, trying to determine my next course of action. He was gracious enough to forgo his hike and remain with me until shuttle service could be arrainged to take us off the trail and into town. Thank you ""Stepping Wolf""! There is a saying among hikers on the trail that...""the trail will provide."" It was during this time that we met our first Trail Angels. Ken and his wife Sandra, a couple from Carroll, GA who were camping in the Chattahoochee National Forest, graciously gave us a ride to the Chattahoochee National Fishery where we made final arraingements for shuttle service into town. Ken and Sandra, thank you! You were truly my trail angels this day!
A special thanks also goes out to Jeff Moon (shuttle service provider) and Donald Ballard (shuttle service provider). Jeff was able to put me in contact with Donald, who ultimately arrainged for Mary to pick us up at the hatchery. Both of these gentlemen were very helpful and I would highly recommend either one to any of you hikers out there in need of shuttle service along this portion of the trail. Mary picked us up at the hatchery and after dropping ""Stepping Wolf"" off at his intended destination in Suches, took me on to a motel in Blairsville. It was a pleasure talking with Mary during the drive and her recommendation for staying at the Seasons Inn Motel was greatly appreciated! 
The back pain and perhaps a touch of dehydration has gotten the best of me for now. It's time to get off the trail for some much needed rest. However, as Arnold (the Terminator) would say...""I'll be back!"" To all the hikers I have met along the way...happy hiking and I hope our paths will cross again further down the trail.","Hawk Mountain Camp Site

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589150,"So I am back on the trail today, returning to the point where I came off the trail several days ago. This time I will deliberately keep the miles low to allow time to adjust to the trail. Hiking consisted of long steep climbs out of Hightower gap and horse gap, followed by a long steep decent into Cooper gap.  I am having to learn to drink frequently and stop about every 2-3 hours to take my pack off and rest and eat. This seems to help the energy level.  The flowers are starting to bloom and there were some nice views during the hike.  James officially became a trail angel today.  Way to go James!! We passed a man at Cooper gap that had come off the trail and was in need of a ride to town due to a family emergency.  After dropping me off at Hightower gap James went back and picked the man up and took him into town.  He was Al Runyon, AKA ""River Rat"" from Gainesville.  I hope all is well with his family emergency.","Hightower Gap

The weather was perfect, not to hot and not to cold, and a beautiful day of sunshine.  The ups and downs were tolerable during the hike and much of the day I was actually able to look up and around and take in the scenery while hiking.  I had my first sketchy water crossing at Justice Creek. The creek was swollen with all of the previous rain and I really had to think about crossing the creek by stepping on various rocks, picking my route carefully.  I still am a little wobbly with  my balance and did not want to get wet!  Thankfully I made it with no problems.  I stopped shortly after that for my lunch break and just enjoyed the sunshine and resting without my pack on. I had one final stream crossing just south of the Gooch mountain shelter where I camped for the night.  The girls ruled the trail during the early portion of the hike today but the guys ruled the shelter area.  It was so nice to pitch my tent and complete all my camp chores and dinner well before dark and have time to relax before turning in for the night.  Rain is supposed to be moving in tomorrow so I have to get up and get moving in the morning.","Cooper Gap

When we arrived at Woody Gap, Choo Choo was making calls to arrange lodging and shuttle service.  We ended up catching a ride with Terry and having a true AT experience with a story we will all laugh about for years to come.  Imagine 6 wet and tired hikers and all their gear crammed into a van full of tools and equipment and who knows what else, with only a seat for 1 passenger.  This fellow was a ""character"" to say the least with plenty of stories to tell.  Everything from being a body guard to JFK's wife, working in 3 branches of the armed services and the CIA.  We were beginning to wonder if we would make it to civilization safely.  Terry was, however, harmless enough and  kind enough though to take us into Blairsville for a small fee where we secured lodging at the Seasons Inn.  He was definitely a hoot! The remainder of the day was spent drying out, enjoy a hot shower and fueling up with good town food. Tomorrow Ya-Ya and Wind Sprinter will head up to Top of Georgia,  The Caboose Sisters and I will return to the trail at Woody Gap and Alyssa will take a down day before returning home to Duluth.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

It was a beautiful, cool and sun shinning day.  No better way to spend the day hiking!  We arrived at the Lance Creek tenting site early enough in the day to complete all of our camp chores and have time to soak our tired feet in a cool mountain stream...how WONDEERFUL and so refreshing!!  Tomorrow I will part ways with the Caboose sisters as they are going to try to make it through to Neel Gap and I will be meeting Jennifer AKA Goldilocks for a couple of days of hiking.  I hope to catch up with the Caboose sisters further down the trail.","Woody Gap

After giving it some thought she told me that ""Mrs. Manners"" may sound a bit ""boastful"" to others as a trail name so after discovering my love for hot chocolate as well, she and decided to combine the two into ""M & M.""  I love my trail name and little does ""Choo Choo"" know that I love peanut M&Ms as well!  This morning I parted company with the ""Caboose Sisters.""  I will miss them and look forward to meeting up with them further down the trail. I met ""Goldilocks"" (Jennifer Griffin) at Henry Gap and after a few photos we said good bye to the ""Caboose Sisters.""  ""Goldilocks"" and I originally met at the Appalachian Trail Kick Off 2018 at Amicolola Falls State Park earlier this year.  On this portion of the Appalachian Trail there is a requirement for all hikers camping from Jared Gap to Neel Gap to have a bear canister for food storage.  I do not have a bear canister and this is a long section of trail that I was concerned about being able to hike in a single day, especially since it includes climbing the dreaded Blood mountain.  ""Goldilocks"" was so kind by offering to bring her bear canister and meet me on the trail to hike this section together.  She is a cancer survivor and has multiple health issues yet here she is tackling the trail with me.  This woman rocks!!

WOO HOO!! We got a late start this morning as I still have not learned to break camp quickly and it was almost noon before we began our climb up Blood Mountain.  It was a very challenging climb for this ""flatlander"" but the views from the top were great.  The Blood Mountain Shelter is located at the summit.  This shelter was built from local stone in 1937 by the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) for the Georgia State Parks system.  Considering the climb and decent of this mountain, this was an amazing feat.  The climb up was certainly a challenge but the 2.5 miles down into Neel Gap was grueling with many rock face crossings, rock scrambles, stairs and switchbacks.  We made it down just before dark and I was never so glad to see a road and the Mountain Crossing building in my life.  We dropped our packs at Mountain Crossings and I waited with the packs while ""Goldilocks"" walked the .5 mile to get her vehicle.  We went into Blairsville for a well deserved dinner before calling it a night at the Blood Mountain Cabins.  The rising moon was a spectacular view during the drive. We were well past ""hikers midnight"" (about 9 p.m.) before settling in for the night and ""Goldilocks"" sounds very congested.  I certainly hope she feels better in the morning!","Woods Hole Shelter

After some much needed rest, she departed for home about 5:30 p.m. I can't thank my new ""Blood"" sister enough for traveling all the way from Montgomery, Alabama to hike with me.  I wish her safe travels, hope she feels better soon, and look forward to hiking with her again.  She is one tough lady!","Neel Gap, Georgia

Like the simple act of kindness from the manager of Blood Mountain Cabins, or the fellow hiker/photographer who taught me about lady slipper flowers.  Then there was fellow Floridian, Scott (from Sarasota), who showed me how to hang a bear bag (this is the bag you keep your food in and hand from a limb of a tree out of reach of hungry bears). A mother from California hiking the AT for the next 4 months with her pre-school aged daughter.  What an adventure and a story this young girl will one day have to tell.

His name was Roy and it was a pleasure talking with him. Roy enjoys helping hikers out each season and helped me by identifying the beautiful red bird I saw earlier as a Scarlet tananger.

I really thanked them for the maintenance that they provided on the trail as well. It seems like my legs are getting stronger and I'm starting to rely a little less on my trekking poles. I could have gone further today with shorter breaks but did not push it. It is a good feeling! Choo Choo is lagging behind and still seems to be having a hard time of it. Tomorrow we will get off the trail at Mooney Gap and go into Franklin for a stay at the Gooder Grove Hostel. It may be good bye to the Caboose Sisters and if so...it will be a sad day!,"Standing Indian Mountain

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596513,"Today was off to an early start with me being the last one out of camp. I still seem to take a while getting the tent down and my gear packed up in the mornings. Loco-motive and Choo Choo both hit the trail before me. I walked at a brisk pace all morning but still did not catch either of them until Mooney Gap. It I amazing how getting off the trail can motivate you to move quicker on the trail! We will be leaving the trail for a stay at the Gooder Grove Hostel and resupply in Franklin, North Carolina. This hostel is a unique place. The rues are: Be Kind, Be Kind of Clean, and Enjoy Being. It was interesting to hear Zen, the owner, come through the hostel with his singing bowl. Today, I found out that it will be my last day of hiking with Choo Choo. She has decided to head out and visit family before returning home to Utah. I will miss her tremendously!!","Carter Gap Shelter

After breakfast and wandering around the town of Franklin with Choo Choo, while Loco-motive had her wrist looked at by a local doctor, we returned to Gooder Grove where we said good bye to Choo Choo. Her daughter picked her up today. I am truly grateful for meeting her and sharing the trail with her for a short while. She has truly become ""tramily"" (my trail family). Choo Choo, I will miss you and your wonderful sense of humor...and don't worry your trail secretes are safe with me! Loco-motive will be continuing on the trail and we have decided to climb Albert mountain together when we return to the trail, but I know that I will not be able to keep up with her. It looks like it is so long to the Caboose Sisters.","Franklin, North Carolina

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596586,"What a climb today! Albert mountain was one heck of a climb with some serious rock scrambles to get to the top. We had to scramble hand over hand over some very large rocks on our way up. The views from the tower at the top were spectacular and well worth the climb, but had I known what to expect on this climb I would not have packed a full 5 day resupply until after Mooney gap! It was a tough climb with a full and heavy pack. Oh well...this lesson was learned the hard way! I said goodbye to Loco-motive at the Long Branch shelter where we stopped for a lunch break. She is just to fast for me to keep up with and I will miss her company. Back to being solo for now. I hiked on to Rock Gap shelter and was done for the day.","

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596588,"It was a real climb coming out of Winding Stair Gap today. I am beginning to realize a ""gap"" is a place I love and hate. When approaching a gap you are generally descending down into the gap...but what goes down must go back up...so when leaving the gap you are generally climbing again. I made it to the side trail to the Siler Bald Shelter only to realize that t was a .2 mile descent down to the shelter but I was to tired to push on to the next shelter. I gathered my water on the way down so I would not have to climb back up to the water source once I set up camp. I have learned t filter my water at the source and fill all containers then refill my ""dirty"" water bag and carry it back to camp so I will have water to filter the next morning (and top off my drinking containers) without having to return to the water source. When arrived at the shelter area I discovered an open meadow area next to the shelter with several nice tenting sites. I thought I was going to be the only one at this shelter this evening until Glen and Cliff came un about 6:30 p.m. They are two friends working on a section hike with the final destination being the Nantahala Outdoor Center in North Carolina. It was nice sharing conversation over dinner.","Rock Gap Shelter

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596589,"Last night I shared the story behind receiving my trail name with Glen and Cliff, explaining that the ""M&M"" was short for Mrs. Manners and the ""Blue"" was for my favorite blue buff I wear each day. This morning Cliff said after thinking about my trail name he decided to call me dub me ""The Devine Mrs. Blue"" That is a nice and unique trail name. Today was a HARD day! It started with a steep .3 mile climb from the shelter area back to the trail. Note to self...always pay attention to the distance of the shelter fro the main trail!! Once on the main trail and following the white blazes there was a period of down hill before the long...LONG...and grueling climb up Wayah Bald. It was very warm today and I got over heated and had to stop and rest several times during the day. Many times through out the day I was hiking from shaded spot to shaded spot. When I finally arrived at the top of Wayah Bald I was exhausted and completely spent. The trail came out to a road which led to a parking area and restroom on my right and up to the tower on my left. I looked at the restrooms and wondered if they had running water. After the long...LONG...climb it would have been nice to rinse off and cool down. I was so tired and my energy credits for the day were spent! I decided it was just to far to walk (BOY IS THAT SORRY!) and since the white blazes led to the left and up to the tower...that was the direction I was going. I was thankful for the trash can where I could drop off my trash on the way up to the tower. The views were spectacular at the tower and I sat on the wall soaking them in until the thunder started and it was time to hurry on my way the final distance to the shelter. I made it to the shelter area just in time to set up my tent and eat a quick meal before the rain began. I shared my meal with a group of college students that are trying to complete a thru hike before school begins in August. They are already averaging over 20 miles a day. I call these types of hikers the ""young mountain goats."" They are full of energy and race up the mountains. I wished them well on completing their journey and I hope they make it! During the night I heard growling and mewling/whimpering noises outside my tent. It sounded like a raccoon with kit may be nesting nearby.","Siler Bald Shelter

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596591,"It is amazing what a good nights rest will do for you! Today was a great day of hiking! it was cool and overcast most of the day. The climb up Wesser Bald was hard after yesterday's climb but the majority of todays hike was down hill. Yeah, I love those downhills!! Just two tough climbs today then the shelter. When I arrived at the shelter area I could not find a flat area to pitch my tent so I decided to brave the bugs and mice and sleep in the shelter. I was joined later in the evening by a young couple who I think are from Holland. It was good thing I could not find a place to pitch my tent because it rained and stormed all night long! Glen even came up to the shelter and slept on the bench because his small bivy tent flooded during the night. Tomorrow I head towards the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) to meet James. It should be predominately down hill to the NOC...yes!!!","Wayah Bald Shelter

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596593,"Well after a wet and rainy night there is nothing like putting on wet and soggy hiking clothes! Today I am headed to the NOC to meet James. Can't wait to see him! It was wet and rainy for a good portion of the trail and the top section after leaving the shelter followed a ridgeline for quite a while. Look right....straight down, look left...straight down, the trail was very rocky and muddy with lots of roots and BIG step downs. Needless to say it was a very precarious climb down to the NOC on this day! It took longer than anticipated to make my destination this day and needless to say I have never been so glad to be off the trail! It was so good to see James waiting in the paring lot as I came off the trail and crossed the road to meet him. He hooked this hungry hiker up with a sausage, egg and cheese McMuffin and a Poweraide. we drove through the Nantahala River George area. What a beautiful drive. Then headed to Cherokee for a rest and laundry...oh the joy of CLEAN clothes! We will head to Damascus, Virginia for Trail Days (a gathering of hikers, gear and book vendors and all things hiking) before I return to the trail.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Web Catcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596595,"We spent a day in Cherokee taking time to resupply, do some much needed laundry, rest and enjoy some good town food. On May 18th we headed towards Damascus, Virginia to enjoy Trail Days, an annual event that is all things hiking related. On Saturday we hit the town of Damascus, listened to some trail stories and visited all of the gear vendors. During the time I went and picked up a box of supplies at the Sun Dog Outfitter, my wallet was lost or stolen. There were so many people in and around the outfitters store that there is no telling what happened. I reported the incident to the local police and searched the vehicle but to no avail. My wallet was gone! I had to return to Florida to have a new Drivers License issued and take care of some business and rest a very sore knee. During this time Tropical Storm descended on the Florida Gulf Coast and made its way inland up into the Carolinas and beyond. The NOC, where I was to return to the trail experienced very heavy flooding and those on the trail were soaked for days. I decided to wait out the storm in Florida before returning to the trail. It gave me time for some much needed rest. All in all I would say that the loss/theft of my wallet, while a he inconvenience, was really a blessing in disguise! More to come when I return to the trail (total time off trail 5/18- 6/9).","
