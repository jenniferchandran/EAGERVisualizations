Two Last Names,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579891,"Georgia to Maine, 2,200 miles, 5 million steps on the Appalachian Trail, I can do that. Henry Ford said ""Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right."" I won't set any speed or daily distance records, but I certainly can do it. What happens when I finish? A bed every night, a daily hot shower, food that isn't dehydrated. Where is the fun in having all that?
I don't expect the trail to be easy. Even getting to the start was challenging. From how to get there to what to bring. My house, the lawn, the bills, monthly prescriptions. Each time I solve one problem, another obstacle appears. And I haven't left home yet. Will I be mentally prepared? Physically ready? Six months of sleeping outdoors walking through 14 states. Why would I try to do that?
For the last 2 years, I've been walking 5 miles a day with one of my sisters 5 days a week. Having a walking partner is so important. I would have skipped so many days if I was walking solo. I appreciate her encouragement and consistency. I don't expect walking 5 miles a day on level ground at an indoor mall to fully prepare me for the trail. But, it is a good start, and should help me get through the first month or two as I get my trail legs.  
Another sister offered to drive me to the trail head. I don't need to worry about planes, trains, buses, or shuttles to get there. I can bring a knife and gas canisters without security confiscating my stuff. That simplified a lot of the planning. Another sister offered to pick me up wherever I get off. Maybe she'll get to see Maine in September. And my daughter has offered to come get me anywhere in between. I hope she will visit and maybe walk a few miles with me as I hike near her home in North Carolina. I told her to take me off the trail only if I am injured. Finally, my brother will be staying at my house while I'm gone. He'll take care of the lawn and handle my mail etc. I am thankful for the support from all of them. 
I received some gift certificates as I celebrated my 60th birthday last summer. I used them to buy newer, lighter gear. The difference between my original 45 pound load and my current 20 pound backpack will make the climbs and long mileage days so much easier. Thank you all. 
And not everyone who got me here was a relative. I was figuring out how to deal with my monthly prescription refills when Mr. Al at Majoria showed me how to get a 6 month supply. I didn't think that was possible with my insurance, but he said, ""No problem"". 
Then, 6 weeks before my well planned start, I received a summons for jury duty in Federal Court for the month of March. I contacted the jury pool office and attempted to explain my situation, but understandably, they didn't seem to believe me. They asked for proof. Proof that I am walking the Appalachian Trail? So, I contacted Big Dog, a former co-worker who now works in the Federal Court building. He went to the head clerk, vouched for me, and got me deferred until October. Big Dog does it again. Semper Fi.    
So, with the help and support from so many, this trip is possible. As I learned in the book Appalachian Trials by Zach Davis, ""The greatest determining factor of success is purpose."" As I struggle with the daily challenges, the emotional highs and the lows on the trail, and I ask myself, ""Why am I doing this?"" I can remind myself of my reasons for attempting this hike. I will also think of the people that helped me get here. I wouldn't be able to do this without the help.",,Maine,"Jan 29, Mon",0
Two Last Names,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583245,"I've been gifted a Spot Gen3 GPS tracker by my favorite son-in-law. He said, and my daughter agreed, that the grandchildren would enjoy following my hike. I think it uses google maps. My sil did mention that if I disappeared, they would have a last known place to start looking. If I disappear, they should check the nearest cheap hotel, Greyhound station, or neighborhood bar.
The rest of my gear is all set. I've stayed mainstream for most of it. Osprey Exos, Warbonnet hammock and tarp, pocket rocket stove, Sawyer water filter, Toaks pot and spoon. The proper layers of clothes, thermal unders, fleece, and a top layer by Bugsaway. Nothing unusual for the food that I'm starting with. Mountain House, Harmony House, Packit Gourmet, oatmeal, Clif bars, and Starbucks instant coffee. I will resupply after day 4 with Ramen, Knorr sides, peanut butter, tortillas, and dry soups, and I expect to learn to expand my food options as I see what others are doing and what is available.
I'm not sure what I'll miss most. The comforts of home. Watching the rain rather than walking in it. Indoor plumbing. Opening the freezer to get ice. Buying everything I need for the week at the grocery, then easily going back for what i forgot. Turning lights on and off at will. TV, internet, vehicles. Cheeseburgers and diet coke. 
With 2 weeks before I leave, I am looking forward to it while realizing how difficult it will be at times. My March 10th start is fast approaching.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Fri",0

I have about a half hour before dawn and we will take the short drive to Amicalola Falls. I'm as ready as I'll ever be and am looking forward to see what happens on this adventure. 
I think about the last two years. A minor health issue, then daily walks, then a walking partner who doesn't know how to take a day off. As I read AWOL on the AT , I thought to myself that's a good idea. So, here I am. A lot of support from friends and family so let the journey begin.",,View Entry,"Mar 10, Sat",0
