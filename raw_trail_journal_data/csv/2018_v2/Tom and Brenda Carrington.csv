Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573284,"Hello again and War Eagle!
Like many baby boomers we have been battling through our share of health issues in the last year.  At least one of us has fought through a complete knee replacement, two bouts with cancer, an allergic reaction to penicillin, a severe stroke, and several other vicissitudes of life that afflict many of us senior citizens.  We now have a choice of accepting our rapidly-approaching state of decrepitude or doing something else.  We need to get back into the wilderness to heal, to breathe the clear mountain air, to heal our bodies as well as our souls.  As John Muir said, ""There must be places for human beings to satisfy their souls.  Food and drink are not enough.  There is the spiritual.""
So once more into the breach, dear friends, once more.  Stiffen the muscles, summon up the blood, grit the teeth, flare the nostrils, take a deep breath and strain every sinew to its limit:  Tom and Brenda are on the loose again.
You know, you shouldn't throw away a whole life just because it's old and has some bumps and bruises.",,Home,"Jul 19, Wed",0
Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573412,"Section One of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail is a mixed trail; you walk the first 5.6 miles in the woods and the last seven miles on a road walk.  The Alabama Pinhoti Alliance, an instructive website for hikers, outlines the hiking directions, maps, and more information for all thirteen sections of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail -- and will be the main source for us for our northbound hike.
While we were reading the large welcome sign (southern terminus of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail) we communicated with two day hikers who told us that this section was poorly marked and difficult to hike.  In the parking lot we calibrated our watch/altimeter in hopes of obtaining select points on Section One so we can post a graph of our hike.
Hoisting our packs and grabbing our seasoned hiking poles, we began our hike.  Our steps, slow and deliberate, crossed a shallow creek, then, followed a well-worn switchback.  At about two miles, we reached an area known as the Boulevard.   Tom's Ipod was playing the Alabama hit, Dancing and Shagging on the Boulevard, as we scooted up the trail.
After another mile or so we were in a wooded area, home of the newly- constructed Weogufka Creek Shelter, characterized by a two-bunk platform, four-sided building, with a sturdily-built picnic table out front and poor tenting sites in the area.  Weogufka Creek is a short distance in front of the shelter.  A nearby embankment provided pleasant views of the creek; scattered small trees and bushes drooping over the waterway on this late evening allowed radiating sunlight to cast shadows on the water's surface like a half-opened blind in a room on a sunny day.
Contrary to what was reported to us at the beginning, this trail section was well-worn, properly-marked, and easy-to-follow.  
Leaving the shelter, a mile later, we entered a large clear-cut area, and then zigged and zagged through a gully cluttered with bushes and small trees until we reached the Flagg Highland dirt road walk, a well-developed dirt logging road and ultimately re-entered the tree line.
Next we came to a foot bridge, an indicator that we were less than a mile from Coosa County Road 56, the end of the wood's trail portion of Section One.
Turning right on CR56, we marched through the friendly town of Weogufka, Alabama, a no-red-light, one four-way-stop town with the main icon, Tomlin's Grocery (closed on this day).  There were no goat trails, so we alternated steps between the encroaching weeds and the edge of the pavement depending on the traffic of the road; the abundance of passing cars made us attentive, nervous, and uneasy.
Turning right on CR41 we made good time for the next six miles -- the terrain was flat for easy walking, however, the same air of uneasiness existed with the vehicles rushing by us.   
At about twelve miles there was a fork in the road where we turned right onto CR150.  As soon as we turned on that road we could see the Stewartville Dollar Store, the symbolic ending of the Northern Terminus of Section One  -- The Alabama 21 Trailhead.","Alabama Pinhoti Trail Section One Northern Terminus

Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573414,"Section Two of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail is a 7.1 mile road walk beginning from the Stewartville, Alabama Dollar Store, progressing around the outskirts of the city of Sylacauga, world renowned for its white marble, before entering the Talladega National Forest.
It was a hot and hazy day when we started our walk following the blue blazes on selectively-marked power poles, walking nonchalantly past several church buildings, passing through a residential district where we were serenaded occasionally by dogs of various breeds and were stared at by a pair of perissodactyla grazing in a nearby pasture.  Passing Coosa County Road 68, we crossed U.S. Highway 280, a four-lane highway we have travelled for several years when we taught Chemistry Labs at Auburn University.  
As we were approaching Rock House Road at Holman's Crossroads, a nearby resident approached us and offered a cool drink of water from a spring on his property.  Shortly afterwards, a truck driver stopped and offered us a drink from a cooler in the back of his truck.  These were the only two people we communicated with during the hike today.  
The summer haze was lingering as we approached the railroad sign, remote and rusted, but a clear reminder of stop, look and listen.  Not many people these days get a chance on foot to see railroad tracks up close and personal.  The image was clear -- simple, quiet, empty, yet picturesque:  the long line of parallel steel rails, a fixed distance apart, nut-bolted onto crossties, lying on a road bed of loose gravel.  What a talented group of workers to accomplish such a time-proven construction, amplified by two of Tom's favorite westerns:  Night Vision starring James Stewart who sings ""You Can't Get Far Without a Railroad"" and Santa Fe starring Randolph Scott, as a railroad construction engineer.  These two westerns symbolize the problems, trials, and tribulations of railroad construction in the early days and help bring out some of the railroad magic onto the silver screen.  The tracks seem to patiently wait for the big black iron horse to come traveling down, in this case the Norfolk-Southern Railroad.  As we crossed the tracks, we recalled Will Rogers' quote:  ""Even if you are on the right track, you will get run over if you just sit there.""
As with Section One, an air of uneasiness existed with vehicles passing by us.  Turning onto 603A meant we were close to completing the entire road walk of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail.  Along this road there were several muscadine vines loaded with tempting green fruit; an attractive and delicious place to visit in a few weeks.
We reached the northern terminus of Section Two, the Trammel Trail Head.  We had a tough but successful walk on this hot Alabama July day; eleven wooded sections of the trail remain.","Alabama Pinhoti Trail Section Two Southern Terminus

Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574514,"We arrived at the Trammel Trailhead Parking Lot, empty and quiet, in the slanting rays of the late afternoon sun.  The only wildlife visible was a solitary chameleon sunning himself on a log.  The parking lot is bordered on the west by a planting of young-growth long leaf pines and on the east by a lovely sourwood specimen in full bloom on this summer's day, and an important nectar source for honey bees in the production of delectable sourwood honey.
Section Three of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail is a 11.4 mile long wooded trail section, mostly shaded, with no severe elevation changes.  At about mile 1.1 hikers encounter a seasonal spring, the only water source on this entire section.  Water was flowing on this August day due to recent showers in the area.  
The trail then passes through a red cockaded woodpecker nesting area, characterized by tall mature long leaf pine trees.  The Forestry Department occasionally conducts controlled burns in that area to control the understory or sub-canopy growth.  The red cockaded woodpeckers are extremely elusive and prefer to live in nests of old (at least fifty years old) trees.  
In 1970 the red cockaded woodpecker was listed on the Endangered Species List because logging operations had destroyed a large percentage of the old growth long leaf pine forests.  The birds peck holes in the bark around the nest entrance high above the ground, causing the tree to leak pitch which hardens and builds a ledge to prevent tree-climbing snakes away from their cavity nest in the pine tree.  The cavities are dug in living pine trees and are often used for decades.  We did not see any of the lovely birds but we did hear their chirping calls, loud and clear, and also their distinctive drumming sound.
Later, the trail follows forest service road 675 for some distance, a pleasant tree-shaded walk -- although there were several large blowdowns there. 
The trail then turns right onto a machine cut trail with a slow steady climb up to the ridge of Rebecca Mountain.  We came upon a previously used campsite, flat and near the trail, which just seemed to say, ""Camp here,"" the only such site we saw all day.  We were tired and began fumbling through setting up our new tent, an Ahwahnee from Black Diamond, just like our old one but with two doors with better ventilation.  We thought we resembled Rock Hudson portraying a fish and tackle salesman forced to enter a fishing tournament who demonstrated his complete camping inexperience trying to set up a tent in the old movie, ""Man's Favorite Sport.""
After set up we pumped up our exped mattresses, shook out our sleeping bags and got cozy for the night.  The buzzing of the summer cicadas was soon joined by a cacophony of crickets and katydids and a multitude of tree frogs lustily singing, against a backdrop of an almost full moon rising in the east.  The loud singing lasted all night, never wavering until dawn.

Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574586,"Awakening early morning we thought it was a misty rain; after all, the weather forecast was for rain.  However, we noticed a heavy fog had moved into the area whose condensation on the leaves of the nearby trees gave the impression of misty rain on our tent; the fog moved in while the bug/tree frog musical show moved out.  
We departed camp around seven o'clock in the morning and soon found large NUMEROUS spider webs constructed right in the center of the hiking trail.  The spiders somehow knew the human forecasters were wrong and there would be no rain today so they constructed their elaborate webs.  The spiders were right; the forecasters were wrong.
We soon came to the West Tower Road at an FAA tower before traveling down a long concrete pavement -- all areas in need of a fresh haircut.
Instead of viewing songbirds and flittering butterflies, we were in the nuisance world of flies, mosquitoes, ticks, gnats and chiggers.  This area of Alabama, especially Coosa, Clay and Talladega Counties, is known for the extent and variety of its mineral deposits.  We saw many specimen of chiastolite, a form of andalusite containing dark inclusions which form a cruciform pattern.
A short walk later, the weeds were totally out of control.  They were so high that we lost the trail three or four times, unpleasantly wandering through this area searching for blue blazes.  Finally, persevering through this area, we came upon a 100 foot thicket of blackberry bramble bushes, rough, tangled, prickly, thorny, skin-breaking shrubs -- an almost impenetrable area.  Using our walking poles as machetes we slashed at the weeds, and slowly, methodically and carefully made our way through this area.  
We crossed White Gap Road, then had a tough upward climb to the High Point Rock Overlook where a cool breeze blowing resulted in a much-needed break.  Passing Broad Gap, another overgrown area, we began our rather pleasant walk down a machine-dug trail for about a mile down to Highway 148, crossing the road to FS607, fifty yards to the left is the Bull's Gap Trailhead.
For a nice ending our son, Matt, and his wife April, met us with a gallon of cold water near the trailhead.  This was a patience-building and character-building hike through a very dry section of the APT.

Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577531,"Section Four of the Alabama Pinhoti Trail starts at the Bull's Gap Trailhead and ends eighteen miles north at the Porter Gap Trailhead.  It is a wooded hike, traversing the ridges and valleys of the southern Appalachians of Alabama, with opportunities for viewing migratory birds of prey, enjoying song birds of various species, and getting an occasional glimpse of the beautiful Coosa River Valley to the West.
Once we reached the ridge line at the south end of Horn Mountain, there were no large climbs -- the trail simply meanders along the crest of Horn Mountain for a few pleasant miles.  Today was a typical hot August Alabama day with temperatures in the nineties and heat index near one hundred, but made more bearable by a delightful trade-wind-like breeze blowing from the west, giving us some relief from the relentless heat.
About six miles from Bull's Gap we came upon an area where recent bulldozer work had been done, disrupting the continuity of the blue blazes.  For the last mile we had been bushwhacking through tall weeds trying to find blue blazes.  This difficulty in finding the blue blazes, and our need for water resulted in our decision to backtrack to Bull's Gap and to re-enter this section by hiking south from Porter Gap Trailhead on our next section hike.","Bull's Gap
","Sherman's Cliffs, Alabama Pinhoti Trail","Aug 18, Fri",6.40
Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577541,"What a difference a few days makes!  We started hiking south from Porter's Gap Trailhead; it was obvious the trail maintainers had done their thing, weeds cut, blue blazes freshly painted, and fallen trees cut.  A hearty ""thank  you"" to the trail maintainers for all their hard work -- whoever you are.
The hot Alabama weather had moderated and we had good weather to hike a well-groomed trail, carpeted in many places with fresh pine needles and soft, cushiony moss.  
We hiked south to where we turned around on our previous hike.  There were many views of the beautiful Coosa River Valley from the large rocks protruding from the side of the mountain -- Wormy's Pulpit, Sherman's Cliffs, and Heath Cliffs.  We camped on top of Horn Mountain near a communication tower.  
The next morning we began our return trip down the hill, again, passing several switchbacks, strolling along the Wind Ridge Road (an old woods road), pausing to eat a few ripe muscadines, and stopping at Scott's Cascades to fill our water bottles.  After a break we headed down the stretch to the end of this section -- Porter Gap Trailhead.

Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578286,"It was a late afternoon when we arrived at Porter Gap Trailhead, the beginning of Section Five, a 15.5 mile wooded hike where some challenging areas, like abrupt altitude changes, three rocky tops, and of course, a couple of demanding miles through the Rock Gardens.  Two miles later and we were approaching Rocky Top One, a pleasant uphill walk, well graded, and well marked by both the turkey foot icon and the traditional blue blazes; both icons appeared on some select trees together on this section of the trail.
Rocky Top One is an attractive setting with an abundance of large rock outcroppings with distant views of the valley down below; it was a good place for peanut butter crackers and lemonade.  The next mile was a  gentle downgrade with an occasional opportunity to enjoy a snack of muscadines, now ripe and growing all over the Alabama countryside.   When we reached Skyway Road we turned right onto FS600, crossed the Talladega Creek Bridge, pausing to filter water, and seemingly accumulated our own herd of mosquitoes, traveling with us the next mile.  After the bridge, we re-entered the woods and started a tough elevated climb with switchbacks.  After a mile we came upon a nice place to set up camp, on the side of the trail with a cushiony bed of pine needles. 
We are still trying to improve on setting up our new tent, an Ahwahnee Black Diamond, with two doors for better access, better ventilation, and better views.  As we were laboring to set up our tent we heard the distant sound of an approaching train, and as it got closer, we heard the more pronounced clickity clack of the train wheels, and nearer still, the loud drumming of three long blowing whistles, and then the sound began to decrease in intensity as the train moved on.  At the closest point it was loud and continuous.  Little did we know that the trains would return punctually hour after hour all night resulting a restful but annoying night.  
We always enjoy walking in the woods together.","Porter's Gap
",Campsite,"Sep 15, Fri",4.70
Tom and Brenda Carrington,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578296,"We were off early this morning.  Within a half mile we came to a spring crossing, filtered four liters of water, and began a long, laborious, calf-burning uphill climb to Rocky Top Two, a site not nearly as dramatic as Rocky Top One.  We proceeded down from Rocky Top Two. ledge walking for an extended period until we came upon the Rock Gardens, a tough, dangerous two-mile crossing by itself, but made more treacherous for two visually impaired senior citizens by the weedy overgrowth.  After about an hour, Tom slipped on the rocks, falling hard on the uneven surface, and landing in an area overgrown with poison oak.  We managed to get his pack off, get him upright, and back on the trail.  His left arm was bruised and bleeding with superficial scrapes and cuts.  Fortunately, Tom seemed to have no broken bones or head injuries; he got up, put on his pack, and we continued over the rough terrain.    
Later, we arrived at the power line crossing, a symbolic reminder of the completion of the fourteen rock gardens in this area.  Shortly, we arrived at Clairmont Gap where we made the decision to hike out and go home for Tom to mend and return at a later date.   The first car to come along was a nice local lady, a Mrs. Lett, who graciously offered us a ride back to our Jeep at the trailhead.
