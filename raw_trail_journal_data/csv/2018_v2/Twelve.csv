Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588624,"First entry.  Feels momentous.  My wife, Kim, and I are starting our first section of the Appalachian Trail this weekend.  We’ve done training hikes in Harriman state park and the Old Croton Aqueduct, went to REI so many times and bought so much gear, and cleared out vacation and childcare duties (Big thank you to Aunt Drea and Grandpa Bill!).  We are excited and nervous, both about the trail and leaving our son Ellis, 4, for the first real length of time ever.  Our plan is to start on Hoyt Road in CT on May 4, 2018, and finish up at Greenwood Lake in NJ on May 13, 2018.  Along the way we will be joined by our friend Eric at Bear Mountain to hike the southern part of the trail.  We already have a hiccup in that it is supposed to thunderstorm on our first day out.  Will monitor weather reports and see what we can do.  Feels like a lesson as to how Mother Nature just doesn’t care about your plans.  Hope this was a good idea :)",,View Entry,"May 01, Tue",0
Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588975,"All packed up and ready to go.  We have a ride out to the trailhead tomorrow early (Thanks Mom!). Despite the fact that there are supposed to be thunderstorms in the afternoon we are heading out anyway, pretty sure we will get to Telephone Pioneers Shelter before they come down.  Very excited, hope I can sleep tonight.  Hope this works.  Hope we make it. :)",,View Entry,"May 03, Thu",0
Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589080,"First day on the trail, started out inauspiciously but predictably.  We got dropped off at the trailhead at Hoyt road and due to my superior navigation skills we immediately started hiking north into CT instead of south into NY. Got that sorted out relatively quickly and turned around in less than 10 minutes.  My wife merely laughed at me, think it’s a good sign for this trip (and the marriage in general).  
After we started heading south it was a little slow going with all the mud from the rain last night but no issues. Light sprinkles of rain, but thankfully no lightning!  So we chose correctly after all.  
Had lunch at NY 22 at Roseanns food truck, great food and even better milkshakes, would absolutely recommend.  The gardening center next to it also has hiker resupply and a great setup.  Bought Kim a turtle, and fittingly her trail name is now “Turtle”, partially from the slow and steady but always gets there, but also for the awesome tattoo on her back.  Seems my trail name is “Twelve”, Kim’s old nickname for me when she would claim i didn’t know anything (also our age difference). 
Met some good people, Quill, a north bounder who we met in a cow pasture, lovely lady who’s an artist and is hopefully going all the way to Katahdin, May the road rise up to meet you Quill.  Also met Scoutmaster, a northbound thruhiker who started in January, at Telephone Pioneer.  He is a a once and future attorney with some great war stories.  Good luck, Mr. Justice, wherever your career leads after this. 
Looking forward to tomorrow, but more forward to a good sleep.","Hoyt Road, Connecticut

Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589209,"Woke up at Telephone Pioneers shelter to a beautiful sunrise.  Drank coffee, packed up and said goodbye to Scoutmaster.  The plan was to do 8 miles to Morgan Stewart shelter, but we made good time and got there by midday.  After a short rest we decided to push through to Stormville for resupply at the deli.  Another four miles of the trail, and a half mile down 52 we got to the deli, and lo and behold there is a pizzeria right next door.  Split a pepperoni pizza with Kim, guzzled two sunkists and I was a happy man, at least until I tried to stand.  My body felt like I was opening a rusty lawn chair.  We headed next door, grabbed gorp, bars and snickers, and headed out.  Unfortunately we didn’t have the time nor the will to make it to RPH shelter, so we decided to stealth camp on top of the rise west of 52.  Hopefully the rain is light tomorrow, we want to make some good miles so we can take a zero day at bear mountain in a few days.  Happy to be out here.  :)","Telephone pioneers shelter

Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589356,"Tough day, but a fortuitous one.  Woke up to a bit of rain, but mostly petered out and just spit a little all day.  Actually helped keep the bugs off which was nice.  We were up at dawn, broke camp and set out for RPH shelter.  Pretty steep up and down over an unnamed mountain with some rocky terrain.  Slow going with wet, slippery rocks.  No mishaps but very sore from last two days so was tougher than it should have been.  Met a section hiker named Shaky from Columbus, Ohio.  He had knocked down over 1500 miles in sections over the years.  Nice guy who was doing a section then driving back to Columbus the next day.  I dig the dedication.  
Made it to RPH at about 10:45 am and cooked up some chili.  Met an insanely friendly poodle named Zephyr and a thruhiker NOBO named Bolt.  He was pushing 30 miles that day after taking a zero the day before in Peekskill. It is fascinating watching a thrukhiker eat.  Bolt blew in to RPH after mashing over 12 miles that morning, dumped a bag of pepperoni in a tortilla and wolfed it down cold.  Then he went after an individual packet of spam that looked as unappetizing as anything I have seen lately.  The whole time he was just talking animatedly about getting north and pushing miles.  He knew Scoutmaster and had hiked a lot of miles with him early on starting in Damascus.  Bolt was a good guy and incredibly mission-focused on getting to Katahdin.  We bid him goodbye and good luck and moved south.  
The next piece of the trail hurt.  Basically uphill for 3 miles to Shenandoah mountain.  I know that compared to other sections of the trail this was nothing, but sore as we were, and new as we are, this one knocked us flat.  We made it to the top (had a nice conversation with some maintainers on the way), and just kept pushing through.  
By this point we were dogged so we began to think about where to sleep.  We were worried that we might have to stealth camp again because I had read that Fahnestock was closed for the season (some kind of renovation).  We decided to chance it and man did we hit the jackpot.  The campground was empty, but the bathrooms were open and had showers with all the hot water you could want.  We luxuriated in our showers, washed our clothes, had dinner and finished off with coffee and snickers.   It was heavenly.  I would highly recommend Fahnestock to anyone rolling through this section.
Will push on tomorrow.  Have about 21 miles to Bear mountain and we hope to get there on the 8th.  Still not sure how I am enjoying this, but Kim and I are having a great time.","Stealth camp west of NY 52
",Fahnestock campground,"May 06, Sun",10
Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589497,"As Scoutmaster told me, “It doesn’t get easier, you just do more miles.”  
We started our day out of Fahnestock and got moving south along the trail.  Our plan was to get 10-11 miles down the trail and stealth camp, as the only other option was to go 14 miles all the way to Graymoor Monastery, and we decided 14 miles was too much for one day.  The problem was, there were essentially no good places to camp out for the night between the two spots.  As Kim said, “I’m not sleeping in the ‘Valley of the Boulders’ so let’s just press on.”  As a result we hiked from 7:30 am to 6:15 pm straight with one 30 minute stop in between all the way to the Monastery.  Tough terrain with a couple of brutal inclines, especially the one at mile 11, near Denning Hill. By the end we were kind of staggering. 
We did meet a couple of nice thruhikers on the trail however.  Shoemaker, a nicely tatted NOBO who had started in Mid-February and was just eating miles, and Jake, a flip flopper who was on his second day headed North from Bear Mountain and would then flip back after he got to Katahdin.  He was a chef from Kingston, really nice guy, who said he hadn’t been given a trail name yet.  5 minutes after we bid him goodbye, Kim and I both decided that his trail name should simply be “Chef.”  Oh well.  Also ran into Shaky again, he was doing another section and crossed paths with us.  Keep the faith Shaky, I’m hoping we both get the whole thing one day.
When we got to Graymoor we set up camp and met the other hikers who were staying the night.  Doc Holliday had started from CT near the same time as us, and is hiking south to Virginia, then will flip North from CT to Katahdin, and then flip again from VA all the way to Springer.  Think he said it was the Cool Breeze method.  We also met Nathan and Sierra(think I’m spelling that correctly), a husband and wife couple from Indiana who started from VA and were flip-flopping while taking two months of the summer off to go back to work.  There are so many different ways to hike the AT, it is amazing.  Everyone was incredibly nice and Kim and I splurged on a pizza and chicken fingers that we shared out(the shelter at the monastery advertised that there was delivery pizza - who are we to turn down such an opportuntiy?)
Ready to move out tomorrow and do 8 miles to Bear Mountain where our lovely hotel room awaits.  There are no easy days on this trail, but there are very few bad ones.  :)","Fahnestock campground
",Graymoor monastery,"May 07, Mon",14
Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589606,"Today was a good day. We woke up later than normal at Graymoor Monastery (about 6:45 am), and bid farewell to Doc Holliday, Nathan and Sierra. We had a nice 8 miles to go to get to our hotel room at the Bear Mountain Inn, and the terrain coming up was, if not easy, definitely manageable relative to previous days. A good easy pace got us up and over the terrain and we got to the Bear Mountain Bridge at around 12:30 pm. 
Before I talk about the rest of the hike, I forgot to mention something from the previous night. Doc Holliday related a story to us the night before about some trail magic he had come upon. When he came to the base of a footbridge right after NY 22 he had found a bit of trail magic in the form of a plastic bag with gatorades, pretzels, chips, a lighter, etc. He told us that he had snagged the only snickers from the bag, and it had changed his whole day for the better. The thing was, we had found that bag the day before, and as a result of us taking way too much food, we dropped a bunch of items off in it, including the snickers. So we got to hear first-hand how our little contribution to trail magic had benefited someone else. Was a super cool moment in our trail, and validated the community aspect to what we are doing.
Back to today's hike, along the way today we met two NOBOs. The first was Rickless Morty (he used to be Morty but he lost his Grandpa Rick at about mile 30, hence the name). He was the cleanest thruhiker I had ever seen. When I told him that, he shook his head and wondered why everyone kept telling him that (seriously, not a speck of dirt on him). We talked for a bit and pushed on. We then met Fox who has been steadily section hiking from Georgia, a month at a time for the last several years. He was trying to make it to Vermont, or possibly New Hampshire if he made good time. He had probably the most positive vibe I have met on the trail yet, and he really talked up the rest of our hike for the day to the Bear Mountain Inn. It is amazing how the right conversation or interaction with another hiker can pick your whole day up and ease the trail. 
After we left Fox we headed down the US 9 and crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge. I have to say that walking on concrete hurts. It is fast, but you feel every step. Give me a rock field any day over a road. Beautiful views on the Bridge, and then we got to do something Kim and I have been dreaming about doing since we started thinking about hiking the trail. We turned left after the bridge, bought ice cream at the pool, and walked through the zoo as AT hikers. The thing is, the Appalachian Trail actually goes through the zoo, and we have done that walk a bunch of times in the past, but there is something about moving through it as AT hikers that felt different. The bear den is always the highlight.
After we passed the zoo we went through the underpass under route 202, and turned south along Hessian Lake. Problem was, we weren't sure which path was actually the AT, because all of a sudden the blazes ceased to exist (A little background is that the Appalachian Trail is marked by white ""blazes"", vertical paint lines in white, on trees, rock and pretty much anything else on the trail. If you hike for more than 100 feet and you can't see a blaze, you probably lost the trail and need to stop). As a result, when we turned south and couldn't find any of the blazes we got a little anxious, but kept walking. Amazingly, walking toward us was a gentleman in his 70's with a t-shirt with, what looked like to be, a white blaze in the exact same style as the AT. We stopped and asked him about his shirt, and he told us that it was in fact an AT blaze and that he was a section hiker trying to slowly knock down the trail in his retirement. We laughed and told him we were glad to see him because his being there was pointing the right way. The best part is that we asked him what his trail name was, and he promptly replied, ""Blaze."" You can't make this stuff up. 
After we checked in, we grabbed food (and beer, Hallelujah!), at the bar. We also saw two AT hikers stumble in (you can tell who is who after a little while), and sent them a round. They introduced themselves as Dice and Disco. Dice had some great info about a throne chair at South Kinsman Peak in New Hampshire. He said make sure to hike there the night before and get up before dawn. If you do, you can watch the sun rise while sitting in a stone throne on top of a mountain. Definitely going to do that when we get to NH. Disco was a flip-flopper who had come up from Harper's Ferry. He was absolutely wiped, but very appreciative of the beer.
After that was cleaning our gear and laundry. Normally I wouldn't talk about something so mundane, but Kim had a singular experience. She brought our clothes to a laundromat in Fort Montgomery while I stayed behind and tended to the rest of the gear. She took an uber there, but had no cell service in the town and had no way of getting back besides walking. Luckily, she was able to hitchhike with a Jehovah's Witness who gave her a ride back to the Inn. When she came into the room and told me this I said I didn't believer her - until she pulled out the pamphlet and business card of the woman who gave her the ride. The trail inspires all kinds of strange and amazing interactions. 
I am exhausted, and happy, and looking forward to our Zero tomorrow. I have a pedicure booked, first time in 5 years, but my feet and toes need some care after the abuse of the last 50+ miles. Sleeping inside has never sounded so nice.
P.S. the place we are staying in is straight out of the Shining. So much so I keep expecting the twins to be around every corner. Don't care if its haunted, they have beds and hot water. :)","

Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589725,"Took a zero day today to clean up, sleep in and gorge ourselves on whatever we could find, food and drink.  A continental breakfast at a hotel has never tasted so good.  We then got pedicures at the spa (which are great and all but two things: 1, your local Korean nail place will do a much faster and more efficient job, and 2, it costs too much money for what you can do with 5 minutes, a nail clipper and some moisturizer, but oh well.  This is why I go 5 years between having them).  After that we took a cab and walked around Peekskill, hit the brewery, thrift stores and local shops.  Just played at being a tourist, ate food and drank beer. It was nice, but I felt almost guilty that I wasn’t hiking.  I started itching at midday to be back on the trail, and as I sit here right now I am glad to be getting out there.  One night in a bed is fine, two nights is dangerously close to getting used to sleeping inside again.  Tomorrow morning we have Eric meeting us with our resupply bag.  Eric will be driven by his lovely ex-girlfriend Molly (she is now his fiancée, so I maintain that she is technically no longer his girlfriend and therefore his ex-girlfriend.  No one I know has been able to argue persuasively that I am wrong on this point).  Molly will kindly take a bunch of gear that we are sloughing off to reduce our weight for this next part of the trail.  We will resupply, pack up, then climb three mountains tomorrow, as one does on a normal Thursday.  I’m ready :)","Bear Mountain Inn

Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589976,"Bid farewell to Bear Mountain today and started the trail again.  Happily we were joined by our friend Eric for the last trip.  He was dropped off by his fiancée Molly at 8 am with a resupply bag (which we had packed before we left and promptly sent back half of it, it’s always amazing how you pack too much food).  We grabbed food and sundries and got ready to leave.  
We also quickly decided that Eric’s trail name is Sunshine, as a result of his fair skin and his epic battle with the sun and his sun block.  
Before we got going we started a conversation with a guy named Mike who was walking his dog.  We told him our plan for the day and he related that there wasn’t much water on the upcoming trail.  He promised to go ahead and leave a gallon of water where the AT crosses the Palisades Parkway.  We said thank you and got on our way.  
Today we had to cross 3 mountains, Bear, West and Black.  As per design, the AT goes up to the top of each one, and can have some grueling ascents.  Even with all of the inclines it was an amazing day, perfect weather and each mountain had incredible views.  I especially liked the top of West Mountain.  
Along the way we met a husband and wife team named Stitch and Timex.  She had previously sectioned the rest of the AT and was going all the way from NY to Katahdin.  He was keeping her company until he got called back into the world and she went to do the rest by herself.  Good luck Stitch.  
As for Mike, we were amazed to find the water later that day by the Parkway.  This man had met three strangers that day, talked to them for 5 minutes, bought water and pulled over to a busy section of a highway to help them out.  Trail Angels are amazing and I look forward to when I can do some Trail Magic of my own. 
We got to our shelter around 4 and tucked in for the night.  Sheltered with a flip-flopper named Whistler who wasn’t very talkative.  Seemed pretty worn out from the trail.  Not everyone wants to make friends on the trail, but instead hikes for their own reasons.  You have to respect that. 
Thunderstorms hit and we were safely snug and dry.  Tomorrow supposed to be beautiful weather.  :)","Bear Mountain Inn
",William Brien Shelter,"May 10, Thu",9.10
Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589979,"Today was simply a good day.  We hiked from Willam Brien Shelter to NY 17 in glorious weather.  The terrain was relatively easy with cool breezes and really pretty views, especially at Island Pond.  Even though we hiked about 11 miles, it never felt difficult and the day just rolled by.  
The highlight of the day was going through the Lemon Squeezer, a rock formation that is so tight you have to take your bag off and hold it above your head to fit through.  As Kim said, “I liked it because it was different”.  It was a welcome change from the miles and miles we had done on our feet.  
Along the way we met a huge number of flip-floppers.  The names I could remember were Jem, Timber, Rainbow, Trapper, Small Furry Animal, Sailor, Kingfisher, Ghost and Reverse.  I think the bubble for flip-flippers is coming through about now, but it wasn’t unmanageable or stressing out the trail.  All very good people, fun and seemingly having a great time.  Also met one NOBO named Red Robin who started March 15.  Guy must have been flying to get here if that was his start date.  
We ended the day by getting off at Route 17 and going to the Tuxedo Motel.  We grabbed beers at the gas station, then found a horseshoes set up behind the motel.  First time in my life I played and I lost to Eric, oh well :).  We destroyed a delivery pizza and all turned in for the night. 
Rest of the trail is supposed to be very interesting.  I think we are all ready.  i just don’t know if I’m ready to get off and go do normal life.  I miss my son intensely however, and I am greatly looking forward to seeing him again.  Time to go to bed, start all over again tomorrow. :)","William Brien Shelter
",Tuxedo Motel,"May 11, Fri",10
Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590168,"Wow, the AT in southern NY is hard.  I’ve never done any other sections of the AT to compare it to, but this has to be up there.  This day kicked the crap out of us.  
We didn’t do ourselves any favors by starting two miles off the trail down at the motel.  By the way, wouldn’t recommend the Tuxedo Motel, not if you don’t want to hear a 4 am argument in the next room about drugs or a money dispute with a prostitute(or potentially both, I was tired and having trouble following the conversation).  
It took us 40 minutes of trudging to get to the trailhead, glumly through the rain.  When we got to the trail after route 17 I learned from the guide that the next half mile was called Agony Grind.  So we had that going for us.  Which was nice.
The rest of the day after that was spent being rained on while going up and down mountains, scrambling over rocks, and occasionally ascending and descending actual cliffs.  It was brutal.  
One highlight was we met two women, Coyote and Cover, who had just started doing the exact section we were doing but in reverse.  They had begun the day before at NJ and were going all the way to Hoyt Road.  We gave them a good stealth camp site near Little Dam Lake and bid them good luck.  
The only other highlight from the day was getting to see Fitzgerald Falls.  They are beautiful, and we pumped water from there and just enjoyed the sound and feel of the place. 
After an incredibly long day we got to Wildcat Shelter and luckily found that it had only one other hiker, a flip-flopper named Gardener.  A good guy from Philadelphia who had just come from the south and warned us we were in store for a tough day tomorrow.  Will think about it tomorrow.  Right now I’m tucked into my sleeping bag, listening to the rain and  I will deal with tomorrow when it happens.  
P.S.  tough as it was, the day was still good :)","Tuxedo Motel
",Wildcat Shelter,"May 12, Sat",10
Twelve,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590379,"Today we finished our trek, but not in the manner we hoped.  Kim took a digger when she slipped on a wet rock yesterday near the end of our day.  She ended up twisting her knee, but after we evaluated it for a few minutes she was able to put weight on it and push on to Wildcat Shelter.  Frankly, I didn't think it would hold us back today as she had been so tough throughout the rest of the trip.  Unfortunately when we woke up at 5 am to finish our hike, her knee had swollen and was painful if she took any strange steps.  We were facing the hardest, most technical 8 mile stretch of the Appalachian Trail in New York, in the rain no less, and there was no way that she would have made it.  We made the decision that we would backtrack off the ridge and head to Lakes Drive so we could catch a taxi.  
Funnily enough although we wanted to finish the last section, we were not disappointed that we were ending.  We had already hiked almost all of New York, had stayed in shelters, hiked in the heat, hiked in the rain, and climbed more mountains in the last ten days than I can remember.  To paraphrase Bill Bryson, we had hiked the Appalachian Trail.  As a test of who we are, and as a learning experience, this was a success.  
The best part of the day was when we got home to see our son Ellis.  We had never been away from him for so long and I wasn't sure how he would react when he came in the door.  As soon as he saw us, he jumped into our arms and immediately started telling us about his new robots, and how he spent time with his Aunt Drea all week.  He was so happy to see us, and even though I was already feeling sad about leaving the Trail, the joy of seeing our son outweighed that instantly.
As I reflect on our adventure, I can say that it will take me most of my adult life to hike the entirety of the Appalachian Trail.  The thing is, no matter what I have written, or what anyone may tell you, hiking the AT is hard.  Incredibly hard.  Probably harder than you can imagine.  Every day is difficult, every day is literally a mountain you have to climb, and every day your body tells you to quit.  To stop.  That you are in enough pain, or that you are bored, or sad, or homesick.  Every day that you do not is a victory.  Every day you decide that you will keep going, or that if you can't keep going you will try the next day, or the next week, or even the next year, is a victory.  It is real, and it is tangible, and there is joy in it.  And so one day, I will finish the Appalachian Trail.
I can also say, unequivocally, that this was one of the best ten days of my life.  I am glad I was able to spend it with my wife and with my friend Eric.  I am also glad to have met all of the people that I did on the trail.  To instantly be part of a community, to be welcomed without reservation, simply because I had chosen to hike the same path as them.  For those few moments that I met each of the people I wrote about in this journal, I felt buoyed by their almost universal positivity.  Every conversation I had on the trail made my pack feel lighter, my feet hurt less, and my determination to get to the next stopping place that much greater.  If anyone I met on the trail is reading this, I sincerely thank you.  It is very true that you remember the people more than you remember the mountains.  
I would like to end with a blessing that was given to me and Kim by Quill, the very first hiker we met on the AT.  Here it goes:

May the Road rise up to meet you,
May the Wind be always at your back,
May the Sun shine warm upon your face;
The Rain fall soft upon your fields, and until we meet again,
May God hold you in the palm of his hand.

Thank you for reading.  :)",,View Entry,"May 13, Sun",0
