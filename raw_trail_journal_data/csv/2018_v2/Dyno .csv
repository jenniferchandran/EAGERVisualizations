Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584387,"In prepping for backpacking I have read bunches about bears.  While I am no expert, I do now possess, through the magic of the Google, a rudimentary knowledge of the habits of ursus americanus otherwise known as the black bear.  Truthfully, its easy to do. There’s quite a bit of information, debate, and first hand recollections to be gleaned via the internet regarding how to handle a black bear sighting in the eastern woods. (whiteblaze.net is a good site for debate & recollection)   Besides seeing them in zoos, I have encountered several bears while day hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  Every single one was the size of a large dog and working really hard to skedaddle away from me as quickly as possible.
Now I am scared a bears.  It is foolish not to be.  A 100 lb. bear is much stronger than me and can do what it wants with me if it takes a mind to.  However the best offense is a good defense.  So, while other hikers would probably think of me as sort of a buttercup, I do carry bear spray with me when I backpack.  I have hiking poles, bear spray, and an air horn.  (You know, it’s the sort of horn that’s meant for small boats, but instead gets honked by crazy Uncle Albert when your name is called at your high school graduation. It’s annoyingly, startlingly loud.  And considering most bears have never been on a boat or attended a graduation ceremony the noise has to be a deterrent.)
Now here’s the rub.  Since I began section backpacking the Appalachian Trail, I have yet to see Yogi or Boo Boo.  The main threats have been poison ivy, lightning, tripping over stuff, a deranged white tail deer, and a troop of wild boars.  That’s right boars.   
Do boars poop in the woods?  I almost did when we saw them today in North Carolina.  Of course I knew enough about these toothy wild swine to be more than wary, but did I know much about them really?  And that’s the part that caused me to panic a little, well  A LOT.  I really had *no idea* what to do when we encountered them.
Imagine this campers, the protagonists Buttercups and Bubba (aka me and my husband Jason) sauntering along, happily discussing that there was only two miles left to the shelter, and dinner, and rest.  Then imagine pulling up short at the sight of small brown butts and ropy tails…and Jason grabbing me  from behind saying, “BEAR!” in a hushed but strained voice.  Nope, nope, nope.  Those are grunts and squeals.  Change the vowel.  “Not bear…BOAR!!” I hissing back.
We stood there a couple of greenhorn flatlanders in the woods carrying really large packs and squeaking at each other with saucer-sized eyes.  What do we do??
Well I’ll tell you what we did.  We backed up slowly and quietly as humanly possible while getting out our bear defenses.  Works for bear hopefully it’ll work for boar right?  Except we had boars plural…five nasty, tusky, temperamental pigs blocking our trail.  
We both had our hiking poles.  I gathered rocks.  Jason armed himself with bear spray and air horn.  And then we waited.

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567391,"I get seduced by the idea of mileage.  On the AT, it is a a badge of honor to really eat up the miles. It makes sense, the thing is so darn long at 2,189-ish miles, that the more miles you can get done, the better chance you will get the whole thing done. Quick N' Easy and I like to take our time. We're lookers.  If there's interesting stuff, by golly we're going to look at it.  However, I get these ideas.  Ideas that I'm younger, fitter, and more fleet of foot. In the planning stages, I'm all: Duh, of course we're going to do 15 miles per day!
The truth of the matter is stark and simple: we need to acclimate.  Section hiking means always breaking back in to the trail life. We have to build our trail legs while on the job so to speak. For us, at first, that translates into 10 miles (or less) per day and a heck of a lot of ibuprofen.
So, I'm going to keep this brief.  I still need to: vacuum seal our dehydrated foods, arrange our meals by day, pick out the clothing we're bringing, then treat our clothes, packs, and tent with Permethrin, finish calculating our daily mileage, load the backpack and weigh it, and then do a gear shake down.  I love these pre-trip activities, and while I work on the minutiae, I dream of all the big miles we are going to conquer this trip. It's gonna be great.",,Walking through town.,"Jun 04, Sun",3

In a few days we will be listening to owls and watching the stars come out.  More simple pleasures...how amazing is that?",,The Couch,"Jun 05, Mon",2
Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567695,"I walked three miles on the oh-so-flat pavement of Pumpkin Capital, IL today: elevation gain  0'0"".  The thought that mountains were only two days away helped soothe my concrete-sore feet.  In anticipation of our departure, I have been working on our itinerary* by consulting ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) maps, ATC Trail Guides, and one of the best, non-electronic resources an AT hiker can possess: The AT Guide updated and published annually by David ""AWOL"" Miller.  (http://theatguide.com/index.ht... ) Ultimately, all this paper weight is too much to take with us, therefore, I feel compelled to type up and print out a 3-4 page guide with mile markers, stream crossings, elevation numbers, shelter sites, points of interest, and so on...  Consequently, that is what's happening tonight. I'm ferociously typing while Quick-N-Easy continues to treat our gear with Permethrin.
Now given today's high falootin' era of technology, you would be correct to point out there are AT distance counter apps that can be downloaded to cellular devices, annnnnnd there are actual GPS devices that can tell us in real time where we are and where we are going while on the AT.   You would also be correct to point out that this technology is better, in most cases, than maps and guidebooks.  However, tech can have massive FAIL moments in the mountains so we go old school and make sure we have a low-tech backup: the intensively researched itinerary.
There is another dreaded F word that necessitates this low T backup plan.  (Wait, no, not the F word that caused Ralphie to get his mouth washed out with soap.) F as in fall.  I fall... alot.  My boots are like heat seeking missiles for all the ankle turning jobbies that can be found on a trail. And one time in Georgia, I'm pretty sure I tripped on air. AIR.  Being that I am almost guaranteed to sprain my ankle while hiking, it is best practice to have my trusty itinerary so new routes can be hurriedly planned and emergency phone numbers can be dialed.

* I know it goes against the bouncy, free hippy spirit of the Appalachian Trail to have a mile by mile schedule of where we'll be, but HYOH!  In other words, hike your own hike, and if planning is what gets you out there, then by all means obsessively over-plan, like me.
Addendum: one of the best downloadable apps that even works when your cell is in airplane mode is Guthook's AT Hiker Guide.  You do have to buy section by section of Guthook's trail reports, but using your cell's location this guide can tell you where you are at and how far you need to go to the next stream, overlook, shelter, and privy.  Absolutely worth the money.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/ap...",,My couch,"Jun 06, Tue",0

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567922,"Starting at 12 a.m. today, we entered the vortex of weird. You see today is June 8th, our 4th wedding anniversary. No pressure! I am so blessed to be married to this man for four years, but I need to tell you about today. Starting at 12:30 a.m., downtown Indianapolis, we were sucked into that vortex, when Quick-N-Easy had to swerve the car to avoid a soft ball sized rock that had been thrown at our windshield from an overpass. Luckily, it only struck the front bumper with a loud thunking noise. Some scratches and gouges and roaring expletives and rapid heart beats later we arrived at our hotel relatively unscathed . Now, we are used to staying in hiker hostels, which can be quite grimy, but the Red Roof Inn was grosser than a standard Appalachian Trail shelter. I won't get into details about the tdirty bed sheets strewn all over, the piles of trash, and the vomit in the sink. Since then, we have traveled to Damascus and checked into a hiker hostel run by Crazy Larry, and had an amazing dinner of surprisingly healthy nachos at Joe's Tacos. It looks like the vortex might be winding down for the evening. Tomorrow starts the hike. Our shuttle picks us up at 7 a.m. and will deposit us back at Watauga Dam, where we got off the trail on April 1st. The goal is to be back in Damascus by this Monday. Happy trails!

Amazing weather. In the 60s...55 tonight. Gradual climbs. Wild roses were blooming but we're too early for raspberries. Met a nice fella while we were eating lunch at Vandeventer Shelter, Big Steve from SC. We ended up with hiking about 3 miles with him, he was good company. Had to camel in a lot of water to Iron Mountain where we pitched our tent since the nearest water source was a quarter mile away. Felt like a pioneer lady as I schlepped 10# of water. (Quick-N-Easy carried a ton in also.) 
At this shelter site we were joined by a group of lively through hikers from MA and MI. Consequently, we had a fun group to eat dinner with tonight. One guy from MA told us how a bear stole his food bag and hiking stick near Hot Springs, NC. The bear also got his spoon, which happened to be in his bag, so he whittled himself a pair of chopsticks from a couple of twigs.

At a roadside crossing we stopped for a snack and met feisty, 20 something Arizonian ""Little Foot who was attempting to hike 42 miles in one day with her friend ""Harambe"" sporting a banana tattoo. Then there was the weekend SOBO hiker ""Gummi Bear"" who was carrying about 5# of these candies with him. Next were day hikers Renee and retired policeman Mark who were out photographing flowers with their golden retriever, Ruby. Once we reached camp we met Dan who is through hiking with an extremely well trained German shepherd, ""Arizona"". As Quick-N-Easy and I sat around our campfire to keep the gnats at bay we met entrepreneur P.O. from WI whose goal is to open a brewery when he finishes the trail.

Eventually, some of our other new Trail friends filtered in and joined our breakfast crowd: Mantis, Just Jim, and Honey Buns. It will probably be the last time we see this group because they hike faster than us. That is a blessing and the curse of being a section hiker, you hike slower than the thru-hikers; so if you find someone you'd like to keep up with you can't, but then you get to meet a lot more new thru-hikers, but that's fun too.

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569164,"Leaving Damascus today was a sweaty affair as the sun was out and my bag was loaded with 7 days of food. Just as I was filming a section of the AT, we came across two twenty somethings sharing a bong. Oop, turn off the camera! One of them told us a story of how he had ""NOBO"" tattooed on his buttocks. We did not get a visual confirmation of said tattoo & I'm grateful for that! (I think I'd have gotten ""HYOH""!) All I can say is: holy cow, the switchbacks up to Saunders Shelter were a kick in the pants. The last time I hiked this section in 2015, I cheated by taking the Virginia Creeper Trail and bypassed 10 miles of this stairmaster for a pleasant stroll next to Little Laurel Creek.I must've became a little dehydrated at one point because it took me like 10 minutes to figure out how to operate the valve on my platypus water bladder. Met a nice family from North Carolina with a dog that looked like Petey from the Little Rascals. (He tried to bite Quick-N-Easy at first, but they became friends later.)

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569167,"Whew. I stink already. Today started with the average amount of ups and downs, even at one point, past a smelly, stagnant pond that gave me a run for my money. Therefore, it was great to reach the intersection of the AT and the Virginia Creeper Trail. There we were able to take a lunch break, and I played in the icy water with the notion of rinsing off a little. Then, it was time to climb up and up to Lost Mountain shelter where we, again, ran into the the friendly family from North Carolina and a new section-hiker named Radar. Her plan was to hike all the way to parents' home in Pennsylvania! Quick-N-Easy and I decided to keep hiking in order to camp at a gorgeous bald near Buzzard Rock where he stayed in April. As we chugged on, mostly uphill over plenty of rocks, the sky took an ominous turn and we were able to hear rumblings of thunder behind us. On and on we went in hopes of beating the storm, but eventually, we had to put on our pack covers when the rain started in earnest. By this time, we were stumbling at about an half-mile per hour pace over rocks as the rain slackened to a squishy drizzle. Suddenly, a lot of underbrush crackling had us looking around wide eyed. Bear!! No. We had unknowingly flushed out two, tiny, spotted whitetails.  We laughed as they zipped away squeaking like little toy cars. By the time we reached the entrance to the bald we were soaked, hungry, and exhausted. And there we stood; dumbfounded, trying to plan what to do next, and admittedly, spit-sucking to catch our breath. Who should appear? Why it was Hot Legs and Fun Size, two experienced thru-hikers doing the AT for the second time. These seasoned wanderers gave us much needed words of encouragement and then floated up and over the bald seemingly oblivious to all the thunder and lightning crackling around us. Well, by cracky, if they could do it so could we, and we trudged on to be rewarded with one of the most miraculous and up close views of a storm in progress. It was incredibly gorgeous. Needless to say, we scurried out of there speedy quick and had to go to plan B. No way we wanted to be zuttted by lightning, tenting out in the open. So, again, we hustled...through a gorgeous patch of flame azaleas... and found a camping site with the other thru-hikers. Thru-hikers who, kindly, made us laugh as we pitched our tent and ate huge tortillas full of Nutella spread. MMmmmmm choclatey goodness. Our last reward before full dark was a whitetail doe wandering through camp. Worth it! But I am sleeping in tomorrow.

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569169,"Slept well.  Woke up eager to go.  Two whitetails close by just checking us out.  We are seeing so many more animals this year.  It is so neat.  Since we ate Nutella and tortillas last night, our breakfast of champions is the Mountainhouse freeze-dried spaghetti we didn't have for our dinner.  Man, I am so sick of most freeze-dried stuff already.  How do people deal with six months of it on their thru-hikes?  Would love pick other hikers' brains about what they pack in their food bags.  I see a lot of Top Ramen  (ew) and instant mashed potatoes (good, but not for every meal).  Other foodstuffs the AT has killed for me: Cliff Bars, tuna, and GORP (Good Old Raisins and Peanuts...trail mix).
One thing that was great about hiking today was hearing the cows moo at a distance, and then slowly winding our way down to them in a gap with a parking lot, marked ""Elk Garden, VA"".  This was the greatest parking lot, like ever.  It had a big, shady tree, a latrine, and a garbage can!  Heaven.  For the uninitiated to LNT*, backpackers are expected to pack out their trash, carrying it with them until a suitable trash receptacle can be located.  Dumping the trash means losing dead weight!  Smelly, smelly dead weight.
Crossing the lot meant climbing the balds where the cows lived.  Beautiful views all around. Some cow poop, but it did not detract from the ambience of that spectacular view. Once we headed back in the woods everything felt muggier, the humidity almost as repressive as the rocks, rocks, rocks.  I do not remember there being so many roots and rocks in this section!  By the time we reached the top of a bowl valley with spectacular views of the blue ridge all around us, I could do little more than grunt an exhausted hello to a couple gals that had caught up to us.  One of them was hiking in a sports-dress, which gave me pause...of course it probably has nice ventilation, but hooooo... what do you do about bugs in unprotected areas?
The rooty, rocky climbs continued in and out of the sun.  I had neglected to drink more water at our last rest stop and did not eat any snacks.  My reasoning? Basically some garbled thoughts such as:  ugh, too tired, will get to it after I sit down at the shelter.  When we reached the first campsite before the shelter Quick-N-Easy had to urge me forward because my urge was to take off my pack and lay down in the soft grass. Unfortunately, at this point, I really was too out of it to appreciate greatly the beauty of the valley and the flame azaleas that were dotting our path.  
As much as I love hiking the AT, I swear I hear Handel's Hallelujah Choir whenever we reach our final destination for the day.  Today was no exception, when we reached the handsomely-made Thomas Knob shelter, I'm pretty sure it was my feet singing their gratitude. As for the rest of me, I was in about the same shape as after attending a bachelorette party when I was 22.  Stumbling into the shelter, I clung to the wood floor which seemed to pitch up and down like a raft at sea.  My head was spinning and confused.  How did I get this drunk?  Wait. I'm not drunk.  Then why am I so dizzy and nauseous?  It quickly dawned on my faithful Quick-N-Easy that I was dehydrated and most like suffering from the beginnings of heat exhaustion.  I think he fed me a liter of water and a cheese tortilla, but truthfully the details are a little murky.
Slowly, other hikers filtered in and claimed their spots in the shelter. It is one of the world's weirdest slumber parties sleeping in a three sided shelter with a group of strangers. Shelter space is first, come first served. Just about everyone wanted a spot tonight as the rain clouds were threatening again.   Luckily, Thomas Knob had an upstairs in which you have to climb a near vertical ladder to reach it.  These ""stairs"" soon revealed to me, just why I'm never hiking in a dress.  As we settled in for the evening, on the ""first-floor"", the kid ""bunking"" next to me gave a startled, mousy-like squeak which caused me turn to see if he needed first aid.  Following his gaze, much to my chagrin I caught sight of a full moon ascending that ladder.  The gal in the dress had joined us for the evening.  
Man, today was one of shortest hikes so far, but it was a challenge.  Good night, everybody!

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569171,"Misty morning. Boots and clothes almost dry. Huzzah! No trench foot for us.  Trench foot, now that's a thing.  Nothing like the photos of WWI soldiers' rotten feet to remind you how important it is to keep your feet dry.  Now why would I be talking about that pray tell?  In another life, I teach history and nothing gets the kids attention faster than some grody feet. But, I digress. 
Quick N Easy & I caught a ride to Massie Gap and were pleased to observe that the impromptu stream created by yesterday's downpour was mostly dried up. The AT was still muddy & sloppy in spots, but I was more than happy to leap frog to keep those boots dry.  
The rain had wrought upon us a veritable bouquet of aromas, including eau de pony poop intermingled with worms, wet earth, and the perfume-y smell of day hikers.  Indeed, it wasn't long before we came upon a herd of ""wild"" ponies intermingling with a fresh & clean family from the real world.  The family was pretty much breaking the ""don't touch the ponies"" rule, and it was easy to see why. Those supposedly wild boogers were coming right up to us, in fact one, tiny, chestnut colt kept chasing after me and then swinging his rump at me.

Well, I’ve been around horses since I was eight, and when this type of quadruped lines you up in its sights it's basically code for: Ima gonna kick the livin' daylights outta you! The situation rapidly became a weird dance from a Monty Python movie, I dodged what looked like an imminent boot to the head as the little feller darted back into firing range. Back and forth, until…and, I do not know what possessed me…I reached out and started scratching his little booty.  Wouldn’t you know it, that colt settled right down with a happy sigh and just leaned against me while I scratched his behind. Lesson: things are not always what they appear to be.

Many stream crossings happened today. Tons of beautiful flame azalea and mountain laurel.  Tromped into a place called the “Scales” where campers can bring their campers and horses and discovered that there weren't just campers and horses, but glory, hallelujah a latrine! At this point the skies opened up again and it looked like we were in for an on-again off-again sort of day.  We quickly made the decision to hike to the next shelter take a lunch break, and move on to Hurricane Gap for the evening.  
Now, I hiked this section in 2015, and I remembered a really mellow trail with very few PUDs and a rock here or there.  (I must have been out of my mind.) The reality was the last two miles to our rest stop was a witch's den of lake-sized puddles intermingled with nasty, ankle turner rocks broken up by very short stretches of compact trail. I may have squeezed out a tear or two during those miles.  (Which, I can’t believe I’m admitting here.)  But, no matter how much the trail can break you down and beat up your feet and drench your boots; there is always, always a pay off: an interesting person, a captivating plant, a gorgeous view, an intriguing animal, a compelling reason that makes you stop and say: oh yeah, this why I do it.  And that is the delicious secret of why so many of us get hooked into this adventure life.","

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569172,"It is always fun to meet a new group of thru hikers.  Our latest bubble included a group of six that sang jingles, theme songs, and the like from 70s era TV.  (""Here's a story of a group of hikers...that were singing as they trekked up the AT..."" to the tune of Brady Bunch...) 
One hiker named ""Snow"" was carrying a backpack that resembled nothing more than those string bag type things that soccer players stow their gear.  I have to admit I was dubious about the kid at first, but he really did have ultralight down to a system, a system that would have left me the fantastic outdoorsy person I am (joking here), starving and freezing. Man, you have to be rugged to carry only about nine pounds of gear and make it work.  But, as all things trail, you do you, you are you, hike your hike.  
Snow was rugged in another way.  His story?  He used to be one of these X game, extreme snowboarder types. At seventeen, he was vacationing with his parents at a Colorado ski resort like Vail or Aspen, stunting on the mountain as was his per usual.  One of the last things he remembered was yelling, ""Watch this mom!""  She was filming his escapade when he crashed, burned, and broke his neck & a few vertebrae. (Can you imagine, as a parent, the horror of having a videography of that?)  Somehow this miraculous kid pulled through and now fully convalesced, years later, is out here walking the long trail with us, inspiring us with his can-do spirit.  (I have a hunch the ultralight lifestyle may be a nod to residual back pain. )
Meeting folks when you are a long section hiker can be bittersweet, especially when you part ways due to different hiking schedules & abilities. They were hiking on 20 miles to the Partnership Shelter, we after a long (for us), rainy slog were going a little more than nine to the next shelter to dry out a little more. Added bonus: we got to sleep in! Huzzah!  As we parted ways the bunch treated us to one of their group sing-a-longs which was wonderful.
All day long the sky growled, threatening to open up as I tried to scamper along as fast as my upset knees would allow. To me, it was a day in the green tunnel, a day where I earned it in my own way. I am not a super trooper like Snow, but it bears repeating, you do you, you are you, hike your hike. 
My motivation? Trimpi Shelter sounded like a veritable paradise.  Trimpi Shelter, fabled to have a fireplace right inside! It turned out to be true, for our purposes.  While Trimpi is kind of a poky, smoky, messy stone building, the fireplace was just what I needed for my soggy boots & chilled bones.","

Once at Trimpi, we quickly made ourselves at home, stringing line to hang soggy and dripping gear & building a nice fire in the fireplace to dry out boggy boots.  We also met the resident shelter snake, probably a variety of garter, so it looked to be a fairly comfortable and mouse-free evening. 
Nature called, now I am not a super fan of the privy...any privy... I am more of the bear in the woods type if you get my drift. But, lassitude had struck and nature wasn't just calling, it was beating down the door. SO, privy it was... until I met Herman.  Who is Herman?  Herman is the largest black racer snake I have ever seen to date. Herman lived the privy. His nest? Right behind the stool. Now I'm not scared of snakes. I treat them like the rest of the animal kingdom, with a healthy respect for their personal space. Therefore, no way was I going to sit and contemplate while Herman draped himself over my shoulders.  Pretty much the privy was his for the keeping.
Just when it looked like the shelter was ours (& the reptiles') for the night in strolled three gentlemen each with a backpack the size a dorm fridge.  It turned out the trio was Uncle Larry, his nephew Jake, and Dan the dad from New York City and San Francisco respectively. This was their first time on the AT, but supposedly had many small sections of the PCT under their belts. Watching them unpack was almost like TV.  Our realty show comprised a flurry of food reveals as out of the bags came: loaves of bread, a huge skillet, the biggest jet boil type stove I've ever laid eyes on, flasks of brandy, a large bottle of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, two pounds of quinoa, just pounds of beans, mountains of candy bars, spatula, a gallon sized freezer bag full of spices, large bottle of Texas Pete (good choice!), a ginormous jar of almond butter, 4 bags of tortillas, pounds of shredded cheese, and well you get the picture...tons of food and... a chess set.  Needless to say, they were fairly entertaining and generous folks, but it slowly dawned on us that they needed some help.   As it became apparent the family had no idea how to hang their pantry of food up for the night, Quick N Easy helped them repack and find suitable trees. This was easier said than done.  It turned out that once the food was all out it didn't really want to go back in. (Like one those highway maps that are terrible to refold.) In the end, they had to use one of their packs, a garbage bag and several WalMart sacks to finally get all the food and smellables up and away.  Bless Quick N Easy, he stayed out with Dan and Uncle Lar until it all got done, even after the skies opened up once again and rained on their progress. 
By this time a thru hiker, had joined us for the night. He lived up to his moniker ""Marathon Man"" by being one the amazingly fit retirees you meet on the trail that just hikes circles around you.  Marathon's look of disbelief at the pile of family's cache of food was worth the price of admission. With a snort of sheer disdain and several head shakes, he dismissed conversational attempts of this friendly hiking family, and chose to bunk by us instead. Marathon later relayed to me that his goal was to run a marathon in all fifty states. Quite an audacious goal, and one that he had almost completed, only a handful left to go.
The fire crackled on. Uncle Lar and Jake played chess and I slowly drooped into that sleepy slumber of half awake that happens just before hiker midnight. Until.  Giggles erupted. Poor Uncle Lar, deciding that the tourney was over for the evening had taken out his sawed in half toothbrush. He gingerly and proudly grasped his half of toothbrush as Marathon hooted over the tiny thing protesting, ""But, I wanted to travel light.""","Hurricane Gap Shelter

Fast forward to, well, now and our 5th anniversary is looming (June 8th). We had decided to go hike in Scotland and scout out a chapel there to do the honors.  It's was a lovely idea, and I still hope we do it someday.  But, the sticker shock of the airfare and accommodations made me pause.  Being thrifty and keeping everything on the cheap would still cost us over 5 grand, for one week. That seemed ridiculous.  That's more than I spend to section hike for nine weeks on the Appalachian Trail. That's what it should cost  to hike practically the entire Appalachian Trail over six months.  Even worse, I wasn't into the planning.  I had the blahs. (Typically, I love planning our trips.) The stunning photos of the craggy lochs and highlands posted by various tour groups just wasn't saying much to me.
So, here we are in freezy Pumpkin, Illinois, ensconced on our couch. It's a good day hunker indoors. A fire is going strong in the fireplace, and we can hear the wind whistling at a chilly 25 below. Me on a whim: ""I don't know if I want to go to Scotland.""  Quick and Easy:  ""What if we finish the AT instead?  We could say our wedding vows there.""   Quick and Easy, not a man of many words, just said the most romantic thing ever.
Spine tingling excitement!  All of June and July on the AT!!!  What if we went even longer? August, September, October...??? Immediately, I got out the guide books and began planning.  Holy Cow!  Let's go!",,"Originally, Scotland...and then, epiphany...back to the AT","Dec 28, Thu",0

The mountains are calling.  We are compelled.  Quick and Easy at first wanted us to quit our jobs in March and take off then. But, we must be practical, it will be better to wait until my summer break and then see how well we tolerate being LASHes (Long Ass Section Hikers.)  We have never been on the trail more than three consecutive weeks.  I worry greatly about my feet.  Stinging nerve pain in my right foot is a real issue. 
There are practical things to think about.  We are both out-of-shape, middle aged people.  The problems with my feet and legs could spell a quick end to our trek.  Can we make months on the AT?  Seriously.  Bottom line: we need to start diets and plan workouts now.  Let the conditioning begin!
But, the mountains are still calling and I am creating spreadsheets and starting to type our itinerary for the first month on trail.  So far, I have an inventory of all of our freeze dried meals.  It looks like we have enough squirreled away for the first 17 days.  Next, I need to do a gear shake down.

My friend Janine and I ran up and down trails behind my house pretending we were outlaws on horses, heck, sometimes we pretended we were horses.  I was not extremely outdoorsy or woods-craftsy.  I liked to walk in the woods; but didn’t do much true hiking (outside of Girl Scouts & family trips) until I was young adult and discovered the five-mile Clark Trail outside of Wentzville, MO. It was amazing. (Go! It’s a great day hike.) Rocky in spots, hilly in others, with stream crossings, & small, piney groves. The pay off? Views from three cliffy bluffs over the Missouri River.  Picnicking there and watching the turkey vultures circling the river valley was my definition of almost heaven.  
That was many years ago. Years ago, I ran up that trail with my sound knees and strong ankles and wrinkle-free skin. 
Then, THE BOOK.  Oh, the book. Bryson came along with his book.  And, I was hooked. I had NO idea there were long trails where one could practically live for months.  Holy macaroni, I didn’t really even understand that it was called “backpacking”.  Back in the day, I didn’t know it.

We started out by climbing a meadow in bright sun and immediately I felt the effects of the beastly load 45# in my backpack...man what was I thinking? Then, all of the sudden Quick N Easy is pulling me behind him, whispering, “bear”. Looking around him I spotted at least 12 black bears???...no wait...it’s a herd of cows in the forest! We had a good laugh over it and then had to shoo a couple of bovine wanderers off of the AT.
Not 20 minutes later,we saw a baby bear (not a calf) which just scooted at the sight of us. Mama bear remained hidden. Thank goodness! 
Our goal today was 13+ miles, but at eight, there were these lovely campsites next to a burbling stream. It was so appealing and we were tired. What we’ve forgotten since last year: the AT is hard! There’s mountains in these mountains. It was just too tempting to go further. We will get there step by step, and as soon as we get into our first town, a pack shakedown to dump gear

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594062,"Seriously began questioning our adventure today. The (excessive)weight in my pack,plus the grade of the climbs and the heat of the day made for an intense crawl up the trail. Imposter syndrome hit me hard as people younger and fitter blew past us. It really helped that we ran into two, new through hiker friends: Cartman and Dragon. Their encouragement meant everything. Out here making friends is so much easier than the “real world”. A shared love of hiking propels all conversations. 
Water source was 1.5 before the shelter...a drippy pipe near a stinky stagnant pond where sweat bees and flies hovered, stung, and bit. So many beautiful pictures of vistas and fun hiking stories often leave out the reality that backpacking is difficult and often gross and unpleasant. 
Thunder clouds were rolling in and rain was expected and we were exposed on a knob all the way to the shelter. I admit I got in a bit of a rush and the footing was not ideal. Weirdly enough, most of our treadway was through a bumpy hay field where the freshly mown hay made things slick. Unable to see a divot under that hay, my weak left ankle collapsed and popped and I did a barrel roll in agony  while internally freaking that our trip was over on the second day! There was nothing to do, we were in the middle of nowhere, but get up (with the assistance of Quick N Easy) and slowly stagger to the shelter while leaning heavily on my hiking poles.(They are such an essential piece of equipment!)
Once at the shelter a miracle of sorts occurred, a physical trainer (trail name: Type Two) was there...out hiking for a month on the AT. He immediately noticed the limp, did an exam, and wrapped the ankle in athletic tape. This extreme kindness made me tear up. Kindness and cooperation between fellow hikers is one more reason I’m out here. Its not just the views but the humanity that makes the grime, sweat, pain, and work ultimately worth it.","Lick Creek Campsite

But still, we said our goodbyes to Cartman who was leaving the trail for good for NYC and see you later...perhaps...to people who were hiking much faster than us including Keebler who told us about fashioning a torch to scare away a male bear in the Smokeys.
Upon inspection, Type Two pronounced that my ankle had a mild sprain, keep it wrapped for 3 days and wrap as needed, lessen my pack weight, and realize with the intense hiking we were doing it could take months to heal fully. A relief that We wouldn’t have to end our adventure only three days in! Quick N Easy and I were then determined to attempt the little over 10 miles to Jenkins Shelter.
Truth be told, even with the good prognosis, itwas a pretty, difficult walk in which we both had to stop and spit suck (aka get our breaths and rest) about every 10-15 steps. I kept reminding myself that in a week or two I’d be in better condition. 
Down and down to a gap we hiked until we were surprised by a new hiker friend Dragon, a befreckled and feisty 20-something who decided to catch a shuttle so she could hike with us! We welcomed her exuberant encouragement, especially which kept us going the last 3 miles over and through rock gardens of boulders and steep inclines while we were misted by a gentle rain.

Needless to say, I was incredibly happy to sit and enjoy the campfire stories with the other hikers here, including a 15 year old kid from CA hiking with his grandfather. The grandfather “Snail” had thru hiked in 1993. We dubbed the kid, who wants to thru after he finishes high school, “Legacy”. He was pretty pleased with the moniker.

First, hallelujah! a stop at the fabled Trent’s Grocery 0.5 from the AT! I bought candy bars, soda, potato chips, Gatorade, a tall can of Bud Lite and a block of cheese. It took all of my willpower not to shove just all of it in my mouth but, we had ordered a pizza, gas station-grocery pizza, which was pretty much the most delicious pizza I ever ate IN MY LIFE. Of course, any card board pizza tastes amazing after days of freeze dried meals.  Midway through our pie, a group of partiers who yellow blaze the AT (drive from place to place, party to party) showed up at the grocery store.

Then the rock climbing started.
Who would’ve thought that rock climbing was a part of a long trail in the mountains?  We should’ve known. But it was so stunningly difficult and surprising to scale ( and in my case sometimes to slide on my butt). The views from The Ledges and the Dragons’s Teeth rock formations were memorable and stunning, but what I will remember the most is the feeling of gut twisting fear while scrambling over those rocks, ledges and inclines, at times crawling hand over hand (while younger hikers ran past), and then the subsidence of that tingling fear to a feeling akin to pride that today my phobias were not going to win.

You just can’t stay in every time it rains or you’d never get anywhere. (He also advises to put baggies over your socks before stepping into your shoe, and then powder your feet after you are done for the day.)
Now we are luxuriating in the shelter after a short day, cozy in our respective sleeping bags, safe from the rain and mist as the sun sets. For me, this end of the day contentment is one of the greatest rewards.","HoJo in Daleville, VA

Now try it with an extra layer, like a 35 pound polyester sweater draped over your shoulders. Good? Now walk uphill. Extreme heat can make backpacking cross over from sweaty and wearing to potentially dangerous and ill advised. Our little “tramily” (trail family*) faced decision and debate. To go or not to go, that is the question when the weather gods aren’t in your favor. Tim (Stripes) and Henry (Bug Bait) were all for putting in the miles and soldiering on right away. Dragon, Quick N Easy and I wanted to wait for evening when the heat of the day had burned off some. All the hikers in our bubble** were wrestling with the same conundrum: lose time and spend money in town or hike out. Most of us are like library books, we have due dates; a prearranged date by which we must get off the long trail whether we are finished or not. Whether it’s a family reunion, end of a leave of absence from a generous employer, a wedding, a promise to a loved one, or even the “closing” date of certain areas of the Appalachian Trail; eventually we all have to return to real life. Tim has a son’s wedding in October. I have to teach in August. We all have the October 15th deadline to hike the peak of Katahdin before Maines’s Baxter State Park closes the gates.  So, we play Jenga with our plans and budgets; trying to justify the time off, or trying to finagle ways to get the miles done despite the oppressive temperatures. Hikers begin to pool their knowledge and resources to come up with steady plans, and for many that means to begin a “season” of sleeping by day and hiking at night. This may just be our plan. Meanwhile, I am going to alternate between Gatorade and water, float in the HoJo pool and watch the thermometer. Is there anything better than cool drinks and a shady pool on a sweltering day?
*Tramily: trail family, typically forms when a group of hikers realize they consistently hike at the same rate, end up in the same destinations, and generally enjoy each orhers’ company. Eventually, hiking schedules start to be purposefully coordinated.
**Sooner or later you also begin to realize that you are hiking in a larger bubble, beyond your tramily, of backpackers that have somewhat similar hiking paces, abilities, and destinations. You see these hikers on and off trail often, leap frogging for days or weeks. Most of the time, these are congenial little meet ups and a very few, (thankfully this is rare) are regrettable.","HoJo in Daleville, VA

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596010,"Welp. We tried. Up at 4:30. Packed up and hiking by 6:30. Glad to be getting away from this camping area filled with multitudes of mutant demon bugs and mosquito dive bombers. Humidity and swamp heat kept me up most of the night with heart burn. So, to say I wasn’t feeling today’s journey would be acceptable and accurate. 2.5 miles and four brown water blasts later, I am sitting with Dragon and Quick N Easy at Black Horse Gap on the Blue Ridge Parkway waiting for a shuttle to take us to a commercial campground.  My guts are reeling and I had a small meltdown at the thought of getting off the AT so soon after leaving town. My hiking compadres are purely giddy at getting hamburgers and having access to a swimming pool. I guess it’s a win. We’ll get out of the 91 degree heat. Plus, we’ll get to ride with Homer again our trusty 80 something (slightly scary on mountain roads) shuttle driver, who always quotes us a price and then says, “It should be more”. Meanwhile, we have been amusing ourselves with sticking out our thumbs for people passing by on bicycles and motorcycles. It’s good for a laugh.

Update: When Homer pulled over he said, “You guys, again,” and shook his head and laughed. He is by far my favorite shuttle driver in VA, believing that the best way to drive in the mountains is to use the entire road, forget those yellow blazes. At the campground, we ran back into our hiking buddies Henry and Tim and quickly made a plan to split a cabin which resembles a post zombie apocalypse bunker.

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597498,"Slack packing is amazing. We have been introduced to this mile eating custom by our trusty friend Dragon. Basically, it takes money (or great luck hitching). You see, what happens is you leave all your heavy stuff at a base camp, in our case this was the mildewed & musty cabin at the campground we happened to shuttle to yesterday (not a recommended place to stop, why it’s in the hiker guide, I...I don’t know). In your pack or day bag you carry only the essentials: 1 day of food/snacks, water, Sawyer filter, lighter, head lamp,foil emergency blanket (if you have one), cell phone, and maybe minor first aid supplies. Well, I admit I wasn’t so great at packing light, but Dragon helped me with a bag shake down (it lost at least 5 pounds...genius!) and I was ready to fly. Next, you get to your trailhead, in our case it was Black Horse Gap where we got off early  yesterday. Then you either hike back to base camp or hike to a prearranged spot where a shuttle will pick you up at a certain time. We decided to do the 14.6 to Jennings Creek and the campground’s quirky maintenance man agreed to pick us up. 
It was so cool how fast I could hike with only about 10 pounds on my back! We strode, skipped, and even leap frogged over the treadway. Roots and rocks...pah!...what were those? Even though the sun was still blazing we were able to truly enjoy the vistas of the Blue Ridge Parkway when the AT dipped out of the woods to join with this iconic byway. (BTW: did you know the Blue Ridge Parkway is 469 miles from NC to VA, and was started as a CCC project in 1933 to be completed in 1987?) My favorite view had to be the Peaks of the Otter which not only provided a beautiful view but a point of historical interest,Thomas Jefferson measured the height of these peaks in 1815 when he was 72 years old.(Supposedly, a block of stone from this range was used in the building of the Washington Monument in 1851.) At this very place we also met day hikers from CA. 
Day hikers can be a mixed blessing. Some are aggressive, and do not understand trail etiquette such as yielding to an uphill hiker. Some are angels who produce trail magic: candy bars or water or sodas. Others are extremely curious about hiking the long trail and abound with questions.(When did you start? Are you going all the way? Do you sleep in a tent? Where do you get food/water? How much does your pack weigh? Do you carry a gun?) I don’t mind answering these questions typically; I kinda hope the answers inspire will someone else to hike. (It can be a bit of a time suck if you get into a long conversation and you have miles to go.) Today, the Californians we met were a lovely mother-daughter combo traveling to see the sites of the South together along with their canine friend, standard poodle, George. I think we all missed our own fur babies so much it was a bit of magic for us to cuddle with this sweet pup, Dragon, who has a poodle of her own, especially. 
Our next concern was water, finding a good water source is always a concern. Once again we were treated to a bit of history by the spring at Bear Wallow Gap. According to the ATC Guide for this region, this Gap was part of a Native American trail that coincided with a buffalo crossing. (Good hunting.) The guide described it as a: small marshy area NE of AT, a favorite spot for black bears because of its vegetation. This was definitely accurate; but, disappointingly, there were no bears playing in the stream just nasty biting gnats and flies. However, as we climbed up into the ridge the vegetation did prove to be a favorite of bears...blueberries!!!
Still no bears. But, blueberries were plentiful and abounded and Dragon and Quick N Easy definitely got their snack on. Eventually, we flew down the long descent back to Jennings Creek where our ride awaited to shuttle us back to the campgroun.  The campground where even with a musty cabin, there was a refreshing pool which we were eager to jump in. It’s just me but slack packing should be called super smart day packing that eats up the miles, but it’s probably not gonna catch on.","Black Horse Gap

Now, with 200 more miles completed it’s time to reassess. Do we go back to the AT? How long do we stay on it? Where do we start? Should we go north, say to New Jersey, to skip the heat and finish VA through MD later in the fall? How do we get back train, bus, rental car???  What gear do I take this time and what do I ditch? Annnd, probably the most important question (kidding and not kidding) do I chop off my long, curly hair for a pixie do?  Crazy enough, we have the possibility of a life changing decision here and I’m worried about how I’ll look with short hair. Go figure. 
What matters most had been the time I’ve been able to spend with my parents and extended family the past 4 days. Leaving River Town, where they live, this evening was really tough.

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597487,"Today was a roller coaster of emotion and terrain. The AM was a breeze. The first mile revealed to us a gorgeous Blue Ridge overlook from a stone platform built by the CCC in the 1930s. Not too much of an amble further was the “Guillotine” a formation in which the trail passed under a boulder lodged between two larger rocks, which proved to be an excellent spot for clowning and selfies. Then the work started in earnest,  it was time to climb. Sometimes, a climb is difficult, but you relish it anyways. Sometimes,you cruise up that steep incline of stone only to stop because your heart is jumping out of your throat. I was properly motivated, we had the promise of lunch, and I was really looking forward to the shelter site, supposedly situated by a deepish creek that needed fording. It was hot. That sounded like a fine prospect indeed. We progressed at a good clip...until... until Dragon shrieked from the mountaintop!!! Hustling to the sound of her voice, we discovered that she had done a pole vault of sorts by leaping over a smallish timber rattlesnake which had taken residency in the middle of the trail.  Now the snake was between us, Dragon, and getting the last two miles done before lunch. Man! I was hungry! There was nothing to do but skirt a wide swath around said impediment, by gingerly stepping onto a crumbling ridge that included stinging nettles. One of the best cheese and mayonnaise tortillas I’ve ever et was et at a beautiful little campsite in a valley.(Of course, eating only commenced after Quick N Easy and I finished wiping down all exposed areas that were burning from the nettles.) It all seemed fun and fine that afternoon with even some bonus sightings of a little green snake and a whitetail doe. But, I had no idea that we were on the long long long descent to Matt’s Creek Shelter. Here’s a secret: downhills are hard, they hurt and you actually begin to prefer the climbs. This downhill downright sucked. Four miles of steep stony slanted descent makes misery for our knees, tendons, ankles, and toes. By the time we got to the creek and shelter, I was limping. Even worse was the knowledge that my hiking partners didn’t want to stay. The much anticipated site harbored swarms  of blood sucking gnats next a shallow and swampy creek with some ticks thrown in for our enjoyment. Needlessly to say, I sat crying and soaking in the creek out of sheer frustration. Of course, I wanted to keep hiking, it was only two miles to town. But, I am the oldest in our group, and due to various sports injuries over the years, I am the weakest hiker. I really dislike this. I was tired, but not spent.  The pain at that moment was intense, but I did not want to disappoint the group as well as myself. Miraculously, after 20 minutes,two ibuprofens, an acetaminophen, and a Kit Kat later I found that I could keep hiking and could keep a good, straight pace. The pain dulled to an ache, the terrain was blissfully soft, flat and friendly. It took us between soaring bluffs and views of the James River. Ultimately, the reward was the pink of a beautiful sunset as we crossed the immense steel footbridge over the James. This bridge was more than a physical crossing for me, it was a revelation in which I could view with some satisfaction the hills we had just conquered. However, the realization also dawned that today, I pushed it too hard, and tomorrow will be a zero to avoid injury. That I cannot always ignore the pain and suck it up, sometimes I will need to face the age of my joints. But, that serene sunlit moment on the bridge made it all better and worth it.

Experimented in the AM with some powdered eggs which turned out to be surprisingly, refreshingly edible.  (Despite the off smell.) The consensus amongst all the hikers here was to take a zero. The weather report was for storms (Which, also as usual, it didnt.) The company at the hostel was congenial, and there was the promise of the Tuesday night all you can eat spaghetti special at the (only) local eatery. It is astonishing and unbelievable the volumes of edibles we are able to consume. Within a few days of toting #30-40 up and down Appalachia...hiker hunger is real...you are now able to eat the equivalent of Thanksgiving Dinner for basically every meal, and heck, who am I kidding?...every snack. Besides  eating, we spent a lazy afternoon coloring in a coloring book and shopping at the Dollar General while swapping tall tales from trail.  The sweet manager of the hostel had a closet full of dresses which she willingly loaned out, so we girls decided to doll up for dinner with the borrowed duds. Of course, whenever we get to town, if we want to get anywhere else we walk...Sometimes (rarely) a Good Samaritan will show up and offer us a ride...but, more often than not we hoof it. Even a day off the AT still entails the use of feet. Locals in trail towns must get used to (and probably annoyed by) the sight of hikers walking the shoulders of crazily busy streets which are typically avoided by most sane people unless they are on wheels. What was different about our rambling group was our finery, no ragged shorts or tees, we were dressed to the nines! The locals showed their appreciation for our efforts by waving, catcalling, revving engines, and good old fashioned honking. (I haven’t been honked at in ages, a little thrill for this middle ager) After destroying gallons of pasta our new friend, we’ll call him “Stumpy”, revealed that he was struggling to walk on his injured and infected feet. Indeed, I could empathize  as he limped down the pavement.We girls  sprang into action and immediately began flagging down drivers  and showing a little leg. (Truth is,it’s much easier to hitch if you’re female.) Finally, a generous fella in a pick em up gave Stump a ride back to the hostel. The rest of us walked. Walking is what we do.","Glasgow VA

There were some weird sounds in the forest last night but that wasn’t it; they didn’t keep me awake. (One bug in a bush by the shelter sounded just like a baby rattle snake. It rattled all night, but it was a kind of soothing white noise.) This AM, I was not feeling the hiking.  I don’t know if I relate to people who jump up every day and go: oh boy I get to hike! There are some days I think: oh boy I wish I could sleep in.  Part of it, I suspect, is my age. I wake up with various aches and pains that, most likely, do not plague the twentysomething crowd. I’m not ungrateful, I really do appreciate being out here. Both Quick N Easy and I worked very hard to be out here. That being said, some days I just don’t wanna. As a result, the relatively simple two miles; mostly uphill, next to a burbling stream, felt like a chore.  Once we reached Virginia Route 60 by the Long Mountain Wayside, Quick N Easy had two surprises for me. The first was that his knee was swollen and he wanted to take the day off. (Yep, I’m game!) Second, he was going to take me into town to a nice hotel.  There have been several other nice surprises since then: a snap inspection by a whitetail buck while we ate lunch at the wayside’s picnic table, a bit of trail magic when a gent from Harpers Ferry, WV pulled up and offered us a ride, a hotel desk clerk that gave us free laundry soap, and a nice gentleman in the laundry room who put our clothes in the dryer for us. Huh,..how nice. The day really turned out just the way it was supposed to. Nice. I just didn’t realize it this morning. We were supposed to step away from the trail even if it seemed too early and too close to a previous town day.  Quick N Easy’s knee will be alright.  He has spent the afternoon icing it and says it feels much better.

I now love bananas and carrots more than I thought possible.  The other day I must have talked about baby carrots for an hour as we ascended 500 feet.) While we miss modern conveniences it is something more than longing...it becomes a deep appreciation for these things.  It's a feeling that we that are able to enjoy running water and electricity are really deeply, thankfully blessed with many ubiquitous time saving devices that keep us very comfortable.

We all have that moment of truth when first trying out the living outdoors thing...who goes in the woods? Why we do! There are whole books on this subject with titles like: How To Shit In The Woods (yes, this is really a book) or even YouTube videos (check out How to stealth poop in the woods. by backpacking guru Odie.) We hikers are so consumed by the doing of the do that it is a perfectly acceptable dinner time conversational piece; and has even inspired trail names like: Poop Finder (she was great at identifying types of scat) or the Prospector (he would accidentally dig up other peoples’ cat holes*), and even Edward Shitterhands (an unfortunate nighttime incident earned a gal this cringe worthy  monicker). Indeed, Q Easy could qualify for a new name such as Bear Pie for stepping in the most consecutive piles of bear dung in a given day.
But, really, I wanna talk about bears. We have seen at least seven black bears in the past week. According to Shenandoah hiker lore, there is at least 3 bears for every square mile of this National Park. Now Q Easy and I have only seen 3 bears outside of Shenandoah (and only one bear outside of VA). People are always asking me if I have pictures. Nope. I’m too interested in shooing said bears away from our immediate vicinity to mess around with the cell phone.
Today, oh today...we solved an ancient mystery...yes bears go go in the woods. Imagine. Q Easy and I ambling a fairly “easy” ridge line when we spot a big old black bear squatting next to the trail. He looked at us with a measure of exasperation: just when you thought you had a moment of peace, someone comes knocking at the door!  Typically, when we come across a bear we talk to it, click our poles, and even tell it to go away! Well, this poor feller was caught unaware and exposed so we kinda just stopped and mulled over: how do we get past this thing?  Yogi seemed to understand our dilemma; I swear he huffed, and got up, walked about 20 feet from the trail, turned his back to us and resumed “the position”. Literally, this bear didn’t give two shits about us. I did not get a picture.
*A cat hole is something hikers dig in the backcountry when taking a poop. It should be: well hidden, away from the trail, nowhere near a water source, and approximately 6” deep. Do your duty and then bury it. It is a courtesy to also leave a “flag” by your cat hole so no other hiker accidentally prospects your “treasure “.","Skyland Area

We are not going fast, but we have been on trail everyday for 6 days. Over the past two months, I have discovered that all the old injuries tend to flair up without a decent day of rest every 5 days or so. So it’s, hello Achilles’ tendon, stinging toe nerves, tennis elbow and, back spasms (let’s not even mention the swollen knees). I often wonder how much easier this would have been in my twenties.
It has been misty rain for the past two days in Shenandoah. It’s nothing like we’ve experienced in the Flatlandia of Illinois. Here, the wind picks up and blows in a heavy fog which condenses into a persistent drizzle. It can get quite cold. Our objective today was to constantly keep moving to avoid becoming too chilled. My motivation to hike in the rain? My pants would be on fire if I stated that today I was seeking a fellowship with nature by wandering down a timeless footpath. No, I basically wanted food, the greasier, the better. Today, it wasn’t about being fit, seeing animals (2 bears & 2 bucks), or even getting closer to Katahdin. Nope, I just wanted to buy a burger and fries at the Elkwallow Wayside conveniently located at the end of today’s miles. To make sure said nosh happened we had to hike fast, we were slack packing again, and had to reach the diner before our ride picked us up to transport us back to the hostel. 
However, now that I’m toasty and showered; and If I look back on my notes about today’s hike; I see so many highlights.  Of course, the day was about more than fast food. Our day contained a visit to the iconic Mary’s Rock and Lookout which was eerily enhanced by the white, billowing mist that made us feel like we were standing on the edge of the world. It was also about seeing a young buck with velveteen nubs so close to the trail (doing the mental calculus of to run or not to run) that Q Easy could have reached out and patted his nose. Oddly, we also encountered a SOBO thru hiker who pretended to be a bear in a shelter we were approaching for a snack break (a shelter reported to have significant stalker bears in the neighborhood). He scared the beheebers out of us. This gave us all a good laugh later when our tickets stopped racing. Was my burger as good as seeing a momma bear and her cub running away from us? Maybe not as cool, but it tasted like beef and satisfaction. It represented the contentment that comes with knowing you have spent your day doing worthwhile things.","Pinnacle Picnic Area

When the proprietress of the hostel admonished me to use a filthy teapot to boil water for my oatmeal, became insulted when I started washing it out, and then scolded me for using too much water; I knew it was time to go.  Not a place I'd recommend for more than an evening of drying out and doing laundry. However, you might enjoy the company of five cats, and relish the thought of leaving your pack on a humid front porch. Each to her own. 
Unfortunately, we had to leave our friend Stumpy behind. We ran into him at a random gap in Shenandoah four days ago. He was blazing along, a big grin on his face. Q Easy and I were thrilled for him.  The last time we saw Stump was in Glasgow at the Stanimal's Hostel, he had been utterly crouched in pain, shuffling more like my grandfather at eighty-five. Yet, there he was bounding down the trail, leap frogging us, like the eighteen-year-old that he is. Now, a few days later in Luray, he was hurting again, most likely suffering from Giardia, a stomach bug most often contracted from untreated water.  Regrettably, we needed to hike on. This happens at times, you have to hike on due to time and budgetary restraints while a friend recuperates in town. With many promises to keep on hiking together once he was up and about again, we shuttled out to the Elkwallow Wayside.
Shenandoah National Park, as I may have mentioned before, has gradual climbs and a nicely rolling trail that at times is reminiscent of a sidewalk made of dirt. The AT in Shenandoah is truly a ""footpath"" that allows for the ""fellowship with nature"" that the Appalachian Trail slogan boasts. While some wanderers in Shenandoah get bored at the ""ease"" of it or complain that there are not enough mountain peak views, I was truly enjoying my hike through this green tunnel. 
Today we had a big, audacious goal: to hike a little over sixteen to Tom Floyd Wayside and leave the Shennies proper. The first miles proved fairly easy. Then, the rain came. Mild at first. Just a mist blowin' in.  I have learned in Shenandoah that when things get misty, moisty you are no more than twenty minutes away from a proper rain shower.  So, it was pack covers on, and for me, a rain poncho. Soon, a drizzle turned into one those driving downpours in which you don't dare look up for fear of washing out your contact lenses.  Dragon, Q Easy, and I were positively pleased to reach Gravel Springs Hut for a chance to dry out and take lunch.  Our friend, Mayo, was ahead of us, she was dropped off at a gap further north of us to test out her recently healed feet and new hiking boots.  We worried that she had been caught out in the storm and hoped she was still game for her ten mile trip.","Elkwallow Wayside

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600574,"Leaving town was easy today knowing we had a NERO to a shelter known for its well kept grounds and five star accommodations. But, first, we had to get there. This was helped along by trail angels Vapor and Boss who dropped us off at the trailhead. We were fairly spoiled by them yesterday as they carted us around town; the post office, Wal Mart, and a Chinese buffet. (Man, I miss my car.)
The trail itself was mostly level with no strenuous ascents or descents. However, with all the rain the past week, the trailbed was bubbling over. We spent most of our mileage hopping from dry footing to rock to root to avoid splashing down in the instant streams. It was plenty hot and muggy and we soon worked up a decent sweat and of course, a loud appetite.  Our objective: Mosby Memorial Campsite for lunch.  I was pretty jazzed about checking It out as we were hiking in a region that had been patrolled by the Confederate forces and their commander Colonel John Singleton Mosby. Mosby, or the ""Grey Ghost"" was known for famously saying, ""It is a classical maxim that it is sweet and becoming to die for one's country; but whoever has seen the horrors of a battlefield feels that it is far sweeter to live for it."" Mosby's sweet nickname resulted from his emulation of the legendary hit and run tactics via horseback by Revolutionary War Brigadier General Fracis Marion. (Marion also had a cool nom de guerre: ""The Swamp Fox"".) Mosby and his rangers evidently rode up and down this section of the Appalachian Trail, and became so notorious that this area in Virginia was known to the Union soldiers as ""Mosby's Confederacy"". Now, do not get me wrong, I am a history buff, but I am not enamored by the Confederacy. It is notable, that much of the Appalachian Trail hikes right through American history, warts and all; and many a time we discovered that we were trekking upon battle fields, around old mustering points, and past old headquarters. Mosby's Campsite itself was disappointingly like any other AT designated camping area; a fire ring, mouldering logs for sitting, and flat spots for tents.  Interestingly, it used to be the site of an old shelter built by the CCC out of chestnut logs, but in 1980, someone dismantled and stole it for the timber.
I was so glad we decided only to do about five miles to the Denton Shelter, as my Achilles tendon was back to its old, painful tricks. And, I was sincerely hoping that the shelter would live up to the hype for being a Hilton among Motel 8's. Indeed, we found  that the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter was a gem. This tidy lean-to sported a large front porch with an Adirondack style bench. The grassy grounds were well manicured and featured a bear pole for hanging those food bags, and a horseshoe pit for after dinner fun.   How wonderful it was to have available a separate cooking pavilion, with picnic table, and hearth. Better still, was the cold rinse I was able to take in the solar shower!!! All the must and sweat from the day just washed away.  What a wonderful feeling!  The only fly in my ointment was a chatty group of hikers at the pavilion.  (And, that's not such a big deal, really.) Every once in a while, you want to enjoy the sounds of silence and lapse into a quiet lassitude of contented exhaustion.  Every once in a while, you run into super chatty hikers that want to talk all evening. It's just a mismatch of moods. I was cheerfully digesting and enjoying my sit down, when an older hiker named ""Shorty"" (not her real hiker name) began to chew my ear.  She was the type of rapid fire talker that would stream her ideas together, ask a question, and then answer it herself. (Truth be told I am guilty of this myself back in the ""real world"".)  After a decent interval, I was able to extricate myself politely as more hikers joined the conversational pool at the picnic table. Tired and happy, I was able to snuggle down in the shelter. It was a pleasantly cool evening, a nice contrast from the day's heat. So there I was, listening to the multitudes of crickets and the random hooting of barred owls while I sleepily watched the sun set.","US522

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600578,"Ugh. This was one of the few days I sincerely questioned: why the frock am I out here? The temperature was don’t ask me about it hot and humid (the answer would have contained multiple ear burning expletives). The trail was squishy at best in places and shoe sucking muddy in others. But, the plants, the plants were the worst.  Now, people often ask us if I am scared out here, and yeah, at times I am. People ask me if I am ever uncomfortable, sure, at times. But, I deal, we deal and hike on. However, the one thing that seems to send me (insert: over the edge) is overgrown trail.  It's pretty much a weird phobia. I can't explain it, I just don't want the foliage to be so overgrown that I can't see over it, (I am short) or have to crawl under it, or deal with it brushing against me. Therefore, it makes total sense why several times I yelled out today: Ahhhh, the plants are touching me!
The Appalachian Trail is maintained by magical people who have hiked miles schlepping heavy equipment in order to trim the verge and hack at trees that have chosen to expire across the footpath.  Some sections are immaculate, and we call out to the skies: Thank you, trail angel!  In these areas we are less concerned about ticks and poison ivy and the like because the going is wide open. Other sections are aspiring jungles that have not been beaten back since Clinton was impeached. Today, we hiked through just such a trailway. At times the weeds created a bower over us or leaned over at ankle level to hide the path from our feet. A machete would have been appropriate. ( a machete, a flame thrower, napalm...)  Poor Quick N Easy had the worst of it, truth be told. He is so tall that he was constantly getting hung up on the grasping greens and had to duck under the weed archways. By, the end of the day, even our steady eddy Q Easy was flustered. (He also needed help evicting two ticks from his person.)
I can't remember much of the ups or downs. I know we crossed several sunny meadows.  We were really excited to see our first sign for Harper's Ferry (32 miles!).   By the time we reached the first shelter, Rod's Hollow, our plan to complete 15 miles was out the window. Unfortunately, my Achilles tendon has been hurting the past couple days, and it acted up this afternoon . (It's slowly getting better!) What was ahead of us was seven miles of the infamous Virginia Roller Coaster, which as the name suggests, consists of some rugged climbs and descents. I just didn't have it in me to go further. 
Yesterday, we stayed at the lovely Whiskey Hollow. It was such a nice, new shelter as was the prior two shelter areas (Denton and Tom Floyd) that we had become a tad bit spoiled. Rod's Hollow. Oh, Rod's Hollow. It basically stunk. The shelter was dumpy and dirtier than average and smelled strongly off cat pee. Mayo declared that the piss smell wasn't that bad and decided that it would be alright to sleep in. Ew. Q Easy and I put up the tent on a pad in a cramped tenting area with other hikers that had rolled in after us. The cooking area did have a pavilion, but the table was about as clean as the shelter. I used a few of our precious baby wipes to procure a somewhat decent cooking surface for us.  So the site was smelly, ugly, worn, and dirty. What should we do? Make the best of it and play Farkle!  And that's what we did. We taught Mayo and a section hiker, Four Liter, to play Farkle with the dice Q Easy carries with him. We laughed at the smells and rolled the dice. Today wasn't so bad after all.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600167,"These were the most challenging 10 miles I’ve done on the AT thus far. (I’ll probably eat these words at a later date, however.) Luckily, I slept well last night because we were taking on the infamous Virginia Rollercoaster. Sounds like fun doesn’t it? In my mind’s eye, I can see the trail maintainers giggling fiendishly over the name at some protocol meeting: Hey, hey let’s name this section The Rollercoaster. Who doesn’t love a rollercoaster?? (snickers) They’ll allllll think it’s gonna be like a ride in a theme park!!!! For the uninitiated: The Rollercoaster is a series of 10ish peaks to climb up and down, and depending on which source you consult, over 12.4 or 13.6 miles with an elevation gain and loss of over 3500’. This Is solidly an area of PUDs*, and according to one frazzled section hiker we met, not originally part of the AT. Truthfully, there are times you just ask yourself Why? Why this route? 
So up and down we went. Sweat just poured off of me, (Which made sense since it was about 90 degrees out.) It was like I jumped into a pool full of smelly liquid, think onion juice mixed with cider. (Basically, we smelled like rotten vegetables.)Poor QEasy is always super uncomfortable in the heat, and today was no exception. Even though he looked fairly hang dog at times he gamely scaled those rocky hills. We stove off imminent dehydration by drinking a half liter or more of water at every summit. It helped. So when we turned that final corner and beheld the old timey rock  entrance to the ATC’s Bear’s Den Hostel, I’m pretty sure choirs of angels began to sing. Oh the wonderful Bear’s Den, home of the Thru Hiker Special ($30 gets you a bunk, laundry, shower, pizza, soda, and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s)! It was a tough day with no real views, but I’m pretty sure I’m off to take one of the most amazing showers ever and tonight I’m sleeping indoors!! Cheers!","Rod Hollow Shelter

Mayo,who’s never seen Ghostbusters, learned today “Who you gonna call?” Oh the sheer luxury and happiness that comes with a zero day! The best thing happened: I laundered my funky sleeping bag. Just out of the dryer, it was fresh and warm and delicious as a toasted bagel. (PS: my bag is synthetic material, do not machine wash and dry your down filled bag.) 
After piles of pancakes for breakfast, I wandered the grounds and easily found the side trail to the Bear’s Den rocks and overlook. I will never tire of the stunning views off the side of a mountain, and the view of the Shenandoah Valley was an added bonus to my stumble up the trail on worn out feet. Tonight, I'm going to bake a supreme personal pizza and eat all of it. Heaven.
Update: Even better than doing laundry was seeing our friend Stumpy walk into the Bear's Den this afternoon. We had had to leave Stumpy behind, nursing a wicked flu/dehydration combo meal at a hostel in Front Royal. Poor guy. Stumpy's health has been an ongoing concern as he has lost so much weight, suffered through an abssessed spider bite.

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600164,"Vortexing. This is a term for when a hiker gets caught up in a hostel or in a hotel. You know, you get too comfy with all the delights afforded by electricity, running water, fresh food, junk food, beds and mattresses, WiFi, being clean, being dry, and basically not hiking.  It is all too easy to get sucked down into a whirlpool of comfort as time flies by and the next thing you realize you have spent days in town or at a hostel.  Most likely days which would have been better spend hiking, but did I mention the cozy, comforts of indoors? Yep, I too have found that avoiding a vortex is a tricky conundrum. 
Getting out of the Bear's Den today was a near thing. I got sucked into a conversation with the ATC caretaker, Glen, about living in the center of all things hiker. Quick N Easy laid down. Mayo and Stumpy began watching a movie, The Boondock Saints, which despite its violent content (I usually, weirdly, fall alseep during action packed movies) fascinated me when I joined them on the couch.  Hours later, we realized, holy cow! it's past noon!  We also soon realized that if we wanted to get up and over with the rest of the Virginia Rollercoaster, we needed to hot foot outta there!
It may have been all the ice cream and pizza I had eaten the past couple of days, it may have been my eagerness to get over the Rollercoaster, but I hiked with wings on my feet for the first few hours.  I like to think it was how happy I felt at the four of us hiking together. Stumpy made up military call and response cadences to urge us on. Hitting the Virginia/West Virginia boundary sign was the cause for much joyous hooting and celebration. I had a happy catch in my throat, 500 miles of Virginia done!! (Quick N Easy and I still have to make up 50 by the Priest Mountain, where we had to get off so he could ice down a swollen knee.) Our choir director, Stumpy, made up a little ditty that basically went, ""We love West Viriginia, yes we do! Yes we do!"", which we crooned at odd intervals as we chugged along to the Blackburn Center.  Notwithstanding our enthusiasm, we soon became victims of the midday heat and humidity and our pace became sluggish at best. Every so often one of us would check the time and our accomplished distance and remark: What are we hiking through pudding?  We must be stuck in a frockin' time-space continuum. Admittedly, the terrain in West Virginia was just as rocky and challenging as Virginia's, but in the end that didn't matter. What we did not make in mileage today, we made up in just plain happy with being able to walk those rocks together.","Bears Den Hostel

Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600162,"I’m finding it hard to sleep indoors. Maybe it is because we have a slumber party every other night with a new group of strangers. But, in general, everyone is friendly and accommodating, so I think it’s actually the lack of nightly noises and air flow. Give me a dirty AT shelter, the cacophony of chirping of a million happy bugs, and (somewhat) fresh air and I’m zonked out by 8PM. I know last night at the Teahorse Hostel sleep was going to be an elusive critter. I was like an excited eight-year-old waiting for Christmas, because I knew when we woke up we’d be going to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Office (ATC). I was going home to our hiker mother ship. When my eyes boinged open at 630AM I was ready to go! But first, there were homemade waffles.
Harpers Ferry is a town chock full of history (think Lewis and Clark, John Brown, and Stonewall Jackson) and is built on a steep hill. The streets must be pitched at a 17 degree grade, and I’m pretty sure it was uphill both ways to the ATC. The people staffing it are mostly volunteers and are staggeringly polite and helpful. Their love of all things Appalachian Trail shines through, and even if you’re not a hiker stop on by and be inspired. I was completely surprised by a tumult of emotions when we walked in. By the time I got to the scale, 3D map of the AT, tears were just oozing. A kind volunteer named Deidra, took pity and assured me that this happens all the time. After mugging for the iconic half-way photograph and collecting our official AT Hiker badges (an orange, plastic triangle with ""2018"" and ""Appalachian Trail Hiker"" emblazoned on it) a bit of wonderful came our way.  Deidra overhearing our plans to hitch to WalMart offered to drive us, wait while we shopped, and bring us back to the ATC!  
Going to WalMart after weeks on the trail is a mind blowing experience.  All the choices!  All the fresh food.  OOoooooo the in-store Subway. It was so amazing that we didn't even mind the curiosity of the civilians who peppered us with questions as we ordered our subs. Subs, that when we returned to the Tea Horse were devoured with much noshing and satisfied smacking and grunting. 
Update:  Wow. What can I say? Stumpy, Q Easy, Mayo, and I are heading to Washington DC in two days!  After dinner with us at a local eatery, The Anvil (get the chicken wings), one of our dinner companions invited us to stay at his house in Arlington while we toured our nation's capital.  Let me back up, we met Dan a kind, fifty-ish section hiker at the Tea Horse. Dan was a beast who hiked a good 20 miles of the Rollercoaster in one go. He fascinated us with stories about his career in the military and growing up in Montana.  By the end of the evening this captivating gent was handing me a key to his four story brown-stone with directions on how to use the DC Metro system to get there!  We are going to DC baby!  It's marvelous, really, the kindness of strangers.  Now I've gotta get going and find an online schedule, I'm pretty sure there's an express train from Harper's Ferry.","Tea Horse Hostel

Woke up from a crunchy position at 4:30 AM when the car alarm went off. I won’t say that Mayo set it off, but yeah, she set it off. She made it up to me later with a cup of Starbucks which I really appreciated. After a quick stop at Wally World to buy tick repelling, brain cell killing DEET spay, we are back on the road towards Bangor International Airport to drop off our transport and get a hitch to Monson. We have seen our first view of Katahdin on a painted mural on the rest stop wall. Man even as art it is a craggily daunting and imposing peak. 
Update:  We have been blessed over and over again by trail magic.  I am overwhelmed by the kindness of strangers almost daily. (If you can, hike a long trail to restore your faith in the goodness of humanity.) Today, we met Mayo's cousin Dan who definitely someone who fits in the trail angel category.  Dan, a fascinating retired merchant marine, rearranged his schedule to pick us up in Bangor.  Understanding hiker hunger, he insisted on stopping at his favorite local diner called The Governor's where I had my first lobster roll. Delicious. Wish I had one now as I am typing this and reminiscing. Dan also surprised us sixty miles later when he dropped us off at the Shaw's Hiker Hostel in Monson with Moon Pies!  Moon Pies are akin to Hostess cakes without the frosting, just a huge homemade sugar bomb. Man my stomach is growling!
Shaw's Hiker Hostel: a collection of cottages and a larger home with positive warren of comfortable bedrooms and bunkrooms run by thru-hikers Hippie Chick and Poet.  If you ever get to Monson, stay and soak in the hiker culture. It's a trippy yet welcoming place! You will be met by either one of the owners or their hardworking staffers with your choice of beverage, a beer or soda. Don't skip out on the breakfast, which to accommodate most thru-hikers' schedules is served promptly at 6:30 AM (Yeah, a lot of them are up at five and hiking out by first light typically, 6:30. Our little tramily struggles to get up by six and up and out by eight To borrow a phrase from my Ma, five o'clock seems just too cold, dark, and mean to be up about camp chores.) Breakfast at Shaw's is positively a deal at $9 for three eggs, three bacon, a pile of home fries, and just mounds of blueberry pancakes. Mounds!  You know, the aphorism, ""Never go to the grocery store hungry,""? Well, unless you want your journal to be all about food, don't type hungry either.
Disappointingly, we won't begin the 100 Mile Wilderness tomorrow. There was a snafu between 1800 Contacts and my optometrist's office and the wrong prescription was sent out. (This lead to a very frustrating hour and a half trying to get everything straightened out. Cell service in Moson is an issue.) I will give it to 1800 Contacts, they really work hard to make sure you get what you need, and therefore they are overnighting me the lenses, which necessitates another day in Monson at Shaw's. Hm, not too shabby. We can chat up other hikers, eat a phenomenal breakfast, and later walk into town and sup at a lake side restaurant.

Laid in until 6. Just didn't want to leave the beautiful noise of the Long Pond Creek. Happy morning music helping me forget my tired muscles. After rummaging through the food bags for a McDonald's Egg McMuffin that never materialized, I settled on a protein bar and my Trader Joe's Instant Coffee. This stuff is starting go grow on me. 
I stared at a little red squirrel eating a mushroom. It looked like one of those dead for sure mushrooms. How do squirrels eat mushrooms that are poisonous to us? I have to Google that sometime. Quick and Easy fixed Mayo's hiking pole that she bent trying to do stunts yesterday. I think she was trying to pole vault over a log.
We started by hiking along the creek with its little rapids and cascades. Just a nice morning to mosey about in. Slow and steady going with Mayo and Quick and Easy. 
Maine is so differently difficult than the trail in the South. For example this BOULDER sort of plopped in the middle of trail that we must scramble over. Dodging roots and rocks, mud and more mud and fording all the streams. We were spoiled in the South, there were little bridges over everything, even dried up mud.  We were warned about the Chairback Mountains by southbound hikers, and we were now definitely in the Chairbacks.
After the boulder there was a puzzle of how to get down into a canyon like area next to Slugundy Falls. The trail looked like it was going straight down this eroded spot on some stone stairs.Somehow we slid down and kept heading forward.  
We decided to keep hiking in the evening to make up for our slower pace. (It has been a little over a half mile per hour today due to the terrain.) At 7PM we realized it was time to camp. But where?  There was a not so cozy spot on a boulder overlook, but the wind dissuaded Mayo and Quick and Easy. So we tromped on looking for a legal spot that was far enough from the AT and not on top of some prehistoric moss.
By 830, there as only the watery light of dusk left we switched to our headlamps. Mayo's never turned on. Mine shone weakly at best and soon puttered out. Extra batteries? None. Gah!There was no choice but to inch along. Q Easy would walk forward 10 feet and then turn around and shine his lamp back towards us and we would walk forward. It was an adventure at first. Mayo and I had the giggles at the stupidity of our lightlessness. However, this pattern of hiking became eternal after two hours of creeping along.
I was whiny and tired but the other two were troopers. I tried to mimic their determination until...until I saw the mother of all obstacles...we came to a hand over hand climb up a 30' boulder wall. At that point, I sat down daintily as a donkey and refused to budge.  I was going to sleep on the AT. No way Jose. Uh uh I was not going to climb that thing  if I had to no way that mess with only one headlamp between us. Q Easy cajoled. I sat.Then a miracle! Quick and Easy swept his beam to the right of the trail and located a clearing off the trail. Clearly a campsite. No ancient moss to kill. Just a wonderfully flat spot big enough for two tents. Huzzah!  We will tackle the next bit of the Chairbacks in the morning.My Payday bar for dinner was about the most delicious thing ever and conking out was easy.","Long Pond Campsite

That slippy root jumped up and grabbed me, I swear! Besides a sprained ankle and some pulled muscles in the arch of my left foot, I have been suffering from writers block. Fortunately, I have been keeping up with my handwritten journal, so when I again have the luxury of a full size keyboard, I can catch up on past posts. 
Time spent on the sofa has been slow time. I have been doing a lot of reflecting while I sit (lounge) at the home of a lovely, local artist who has sheltered us for the past two days while I heal. Her artwork is wonderful. Please go to her website: Nancy Jolly.  (She has so much more to share than what is even posted there!) 
Why do I hike? I suppose I am compelled. The monkey brain spin subsidies as I stomp up the treadway and I am so much less wound up. A sense of adventure, of course, to do and see new things and meet new people such as my new artist friend, are also solid reasons. To be honest, I am trying to process what it means to live an authentic and useful life. Have I given back? What comes next? What is my purpose or mission? The mountains are a wonderful place for meditative thinking, but recently this reflection has been tinged with sorrow.
Recently, we received some sobering news about a dear, dear family member. This is a once in a lifetime type of person about whom even a rogue could say nothing wrong or malignant. Just knowing my cousin is out there spreading his own brand of happiness to everyone he encountered gives us joy. Now, we are in prayerful hope that all goes smoothly in the last. I am miles away from home, doing the hiking thing, the adventure he so encouraged and supported.

After rolling and popping it three, yes three times, since June, Quick N Easy and I had to have a state of the union meeting. Some tears were shed on my part, was it time to go home? Basically, it came down to this: distance and destination are now out the window. We both want to keep going, but the new goal is to truly enjoy everyday we are out here. Not that we weren’t before, but with repeated injury, our focus and reason for being has shifted somewhat. Now, I am extremely thankful every mile that we accomplish, and am much, much less preoccupied with the number of miles hiked daily and finishing on time. We are now “Slow-bos”, hiking tourists on the AT; stopping to gawk at everything and anything from a speckled flame-orange newt in the treadway,  to a goofy duck that decided to follow us for a bit, to also the moss slicked stone walls leftover from the Revolutionary era, or to the roar of the boiling rapids in 10 Mile River. 
Earlier today, Trail Angel Lisa dropped us off at the crossing of Shagticoke and Bulls Bridge roads. I was so hallelujah happy to be hiking even a little bit because it meant we weren’t down and out yet. The trail was a gorgeous and easy meander along the rain swollen river, the sun was out, and the temperature was comfortable in the 70s. Crossing an iron bridge we were able to stop and take pictures of the technicolor leaves dotting the trees. We have become what northeasterners call autumnal travelers: leaf peepers.  
Not too long after beginning our amble, we arrived at the shelter. It was situated in a pretty meadow next to more stone walls. Stumpy was there waiting for us, as he had hiked on while me and my ankle convalesced at the trail angel’s home. It was a happy meeting. A bald eagle soared over the meadow, circling above us for much of the afternoon, which I took as a good omen.

We sat cozily on the couch and dreamed for days, and then we planned for months. Multiple maps were consulted. I read all of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy trail guides...a set of twelve books covering sections of Georgia to Maine with historical tidbits, points of interest, and step by step details down to the tenth of the mile. We read the AWOL’s 2018 Appalachian Trail Guide and cross referenced it to the 2016 Guide, the aforementioned ATC guides, and the Gut Hook App on our cell phone. (Get this app, it is worth every penny!!) We packed up a house and gave up eating out. I have always been frugal, but saving went into high gear. No extras. Pay off all the bills. The goal: a budget for 1,800 miles of hiking. 
Over the past five years, we hiked short sections on the AT, and these added up mile by tantalizing mile. However, our trips never lasted longer than three weeks. We were merely dipping our toes into the world of the long distance hiking. All of the sudden, we were planning to live outside...literally for three months*... and the logistics were daunting. It meant immersing ourselves in all that is the AT. I loved it. I relished every moment of testing, weighing, and checking our gear and  dehydrating foods while planning (kinda) nutritious (and yummy) menus that didn't weigh down our food bags. (It turned out they did anyways, food and water really is among the heaviest of all ""gear"" most hikers carry.) It was fun to read over all those guides and type out daily itineraries which forecast how  Quick N Easy and I would be traipsing from 10,… 12,… 15,…18, to 22 miles per day as we buffed out our leg muscles in them there hills.  
By June, we were ready to go, starting in Virginia at the very spot where we'd left off from our last section hike. I laugh a little now. We were so innocent in some ways. We were going to conquer the mountains in big confident strides of confidence while disdainfully snorting at weather, rocks, incline, critters, injury...all were conquerable. I laugh now, because we never came close to averaging 15 to 20 miles per day. But, that’s ok.  We took long lunch breaks. We took pictures. We took naps. We soaked in streams. We stood at vistas and went into towns. We nursed injuries. We went home. We saw stuff. We did stuff.  Every once in a while we had a big mileage day, mostly we hiked our own hike.  In the end we didn’t make 1,800 miles, it was closer to 900. Do I sometimes regret it? Yeah, I’m competitive as the next person. 
It is so easy to beat yourself up. Are you strong enough? Skinny enough? Adventurous, smart, active, motivated???…ugh. Some days, when we didn’t make the miles I’d feel frantic. Why was this 72-year-old zooming past us?  Why couldn’t we keep up?  Am I holding Quick and Easy back?…he’s the stronger hiker. 
Of the vast plethora of  books written about the Appalachian Trail, virtually all of them describe it as a mental experience. To progress a hiker must shed negativity, and keep on stepping. Indeed, I learned, the AT can be an ode to joy…a thing that represents all that charms you…reminding you to slow down, breathe, appreciate. The AT can destroy you, joint by joint, through ankle twists, tears, and rain. It can strip you down to raw emotions and help you realize that at times, yes; yes you are obnoxious, jealous, and officious. But, if you let it, it will build you back up again as you turn a corner and simply see all that is beautiful in a huge 300 year old oak, or witness a gaggle of swans swimming lazily on a Nuclear Lake, or meet a stranger who inspired by your trip may set out on one of his own adventures someday and then, then you are refreshed and reborn to the trail. I tell you, it is spiritual. 
We left the trail for good on November 9th. Looking through the thousand(s) of pictures we took was too raw back in November. I tried to put it out of my mind. I didn’t want to pine. We were incredibly thankful for our time in the woods, it would seem downright churlish to be despondent. Unfortunately, the post trail blues are real, and it was hard work not to obsess about our obsession, I had no clear idea how soon we’d be able to get back to it. Plus, we were (and are still) busy looking for employment. Who has time for reminiscing anyways, right? 
Today, I found a picture that made it all better. A couple years ago, on a section hike in North Carolina and Tennessee, Quick N Easy snapped a picture of me on a bald that was trail north of Davenport Gap (gosh, I wish I could remember its name). What I saw, back then, in that pic was a flabby stomach and a saggy chest, all topped with frizzy hair. What a waste of thought! Now I see a picture of a gloriously happy woman. A woman in her element, feeling strong and content.  I see a woman smiling at her loving partner who has stopped to capture that moment of strength to help her remember later, when she isn’t feeling as strong. Today I embraced it all. Memories like these are important. Memories like these are why we hiked in the first place.

We are so incredibly grateful for those who helped us make this experience a reality. I cannot express enough gratitude to our parents and siblings and friends and all the trail angels we met who were so important to and continue to be so supportive in our adventures. We are indeed privileged to come from families and have friends that get us and want us to go get! These incredible individuals helped us move, watched our fur babies, sent us supplies, helped create those yummy meals, offered us rides, and gave us love and encouragement every step of our journey. I cannot thank them enough.  I also am so grateful to my rock, Quick N Easy for being the person who most understood my dream of hiking a long trail. Once I asked him why he was out here with me, and he replied, “What kind of person would I be if I didn’t help you with your dreams?”  
HYOH!

*We were out on the road for over five months, but only spent three months actually hiking the AT...mostly due to injures and illness, but also I have to admit, we did have some amazing side trips to Washington DC, New Hampshire, New York, Georgia and Florida.",,View Entry,"Dec 28, Fri",0
Dyno ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606277,"2018 was a year of learning and exploration. By 2017, I was sleeping all the time. It seemed that my life had become one long snooze in between times of extreme stress and moments of joy.  Shouldn’t both stress and joy be experiential? Aren’t they moments to learn from?  However, I had begun sleeping the best and worst bits away as a defense mechanism.  I wasn’t depressed or bored. I’m not really wired that way. No, I was just tired. I loved teaching. I didn’t love teaching. I loved the life we built, and I was mired by the life we built. In December 2017, I was at a turning point. Who was I going to grow up to be? How much longer was I going to delay a big goal?  What was I actually working towards?  Shouldn’t life be more than a sleepy tale full of dull sound and muted fury signifying nothing?

There is a beauty to a simple existence structured around the rise and setting of the sun. Your day is merely structured by where your feet can take you. What a simple pleasure it is to encounter a stunning vista overlooking a wide valley, and realize that you made it there under your own locomotion.  How cozy it is to make dinner in a shelter at dusk listening to barred owls, drowse to the calls of whippoorwills, and wake to the chirping of songbirds. Who knew I would begin to prefer to sleep on the rooty ground in a tent than on a soft mattress at home?  I never thought I’d want anything, but a large beautiful house someday, but instead, home became where our packs were and where we were together. 
In 2018, I learned that I could walk up rocks and live in the woods. I learned that I could walk miles in the rain. I drank from streams and it was delicious.  I reeked and I relished the odor of my sweat because it smelled like accomplishment. I learned that less is more, and that I could do more than just survive with the simple possessions that I toted along with me on my back. After years of searching for a soul mate, and even a divorce in my past; I learned the absolute happiness afforded by a strong partnership based on mutual respect and laughter. In 2018, I learned that money does not have to be used for a mortgage, a new car, or the latest whatever.  I now worry much less about wearing makeup and whether my stomach is too big.  I now laugh so much more at silly little things. 
It was difficult to put that adventure on hold and come back to the “real world”.  It is easy to be tempted by all that surrounds us and tells us that we need to be thinner, prettier, younger, wealthier, and more smartly dressed…tells us that we are never enough. But, we all know that that’s not the truth. Our truths are what brings all of us simple joy. There are so many simple joys that we miss, at times, in our noisy lives; joys of family and friends, of learning something new, of taking a small step that will bring us closer to a larger goal, of eating a good meal without guilt, of spending a lazy day with your dog, of appreciating a walk at sunset, or admiring the twinkling lights of a city. Taking a time out to breathe, assess, and value the simple things should be available to all of us, not just a lucky few with oversized budgets.  
I am here to attest that this is possible. It is entirely possible to reboot a dream put on pause.  Big audacious goals take planning, lots of planning.  You can become bogged down in the logistics, but do not lose sight of your dream to make whatever is charming and essential to you a reality.  It may take years. It took me over twenty years to gather the courage to be adventuresome and live outside on the long trail. Once realized, it then took us six years to plan and save for our long Appalachian adventure. Do not lose sight of what you want to do. You may need to amend your plans, troubleshoot here and there, but keep on stepping. You can. You’ll get there. When you do, I hope to hear of your joys, to read of your testimony to what made you feel more alive and more vital and more a part of the universal flow of being. May you be blessed in all things that make you you. Happy 2019! Hope to see you out there.",,We walked to church.,"Jan 01, Tue",1
