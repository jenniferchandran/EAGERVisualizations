HooYaa!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517980,Trying out a journaling app for my phone to see if I can somehow use it on the AT and be able to upload to trailjournals.com.,,View Entry,"Dec 03, Thu",0
HooYaa!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520511,Thinking ahead about options for journaling while on the AT. For now I will plan on using my phone using a notebook app and download to TJ when I have good connection. Not sure yet about how to add photos for a given day but I hope I can do it from my phone. I also want to take videos during the hike and upload them to a utube account. Another techno skill to learn and perfect down the road. I have been thinking more seriously about revising the format of my thru hike from the traditional Springer Mt start to a mid point and then flip after Maine and head south. I need to find more journals from completed flip flop hikers for their views on their experiences.,"

HooYaa!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522264,One aspect of doing a flip flop hike that may impact my gear selection is the weather at lower elevations in MD and PA vs the higher elevations in GA and NC at the start. I may be able to get by with a 30 deg bag instead of a 15-20 one. This would save some on price and weight. The biggest concern would be the possibility of a cold snap in the Whites and the same in the Smokies in Oct. I guess I could always add a liner as I approach those areas if need be.,,View Entry,"Mar 02, Wed",0
HooYaa!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550966,Got to spend the Saturday of Trail Days this year in Damascus. Stopped by the ZPacks display and had a great time talking with Red Beard (Will Wood) and Joe. Ended up buying an Arc Haul on sale and some discounted accessories like a rain kilt and stuff sacks. Spent the next week hiking with other Road Scholar program participants on day hikes on the AT nearby. The pack worked great and so did the kilt.,,Getting the gear,"Oct 27, Thu",0
