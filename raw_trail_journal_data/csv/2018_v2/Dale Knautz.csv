Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586257,"This entry covers four days of hiking beginning at Amicalola and ending at Neel Gap. Total distance over the 4 days is 38.8 miles. Day 1, was hoping to start at Springer Mountain but Mike U. couldn't find the forest service road so we circled back. That put an extra 7.7 miles to the hike, thanks Mike, ha ha! Day 1 totaled a tad over 10 miles. Stayed in a shelter since too tired to setup tent. Hiked most of day on my own. Day 2 was a surprise in that after 3 miles came to a support group for hikers. Had hot bowl soup and took a bar to go. This is called trail magic. Hike was in dreary weather but went almost 13 miles. Spent night at Gooch Mountain shelter in tent and froze as it rained all night. Day 3 was bad from the start. Packing up in cold and wet conditions. When hike began I wore socks as gloves and hiked in freezing rain with ice falling off trees. The ice was like dime size but not dangerous. Came across a sign saying trail magic ahead. Awesome! Another group there with free food for hikers. Had a hot tea, hot dog, tangerine and some raw broccoli with ranch. Rita gave me a knit cap for warmth. These people are great! Reached Lance Creek to setup camp. Another cold night but the worst of it was I cracked a molar on jerky at dinner. Had a panic attack being middle of nowhere with pain looming. Got through the night without tooth pain. Day 4 hiked just a bit over 7 miles and across Blood Mountain. May have been short in miles but major in height. Ate only 2 granola bars while hiking since worried about tooth. At top of Blood Mountain talked briefly with two hikers. One was 69 the other 60 and they moved like the wind. Mike U. helped setup trip where I ended at Neel Gap to small town Blairsville, GA where I'm at now in hotel awaiting dentist appointment tomorrow at 4:30. Thanks Mike! Had bowl of chili and two servings of mashed potatoes for dinner at the Huddle House. Drying out all my gear in hotel room and will do laundry tomorrow. Hoping for the best with tooth! Met hikers from Germany, Australia and France. But, will the sun ever come out in Georgia?","Amicalola Falls State Park

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586466,"Well, Tuesday I made it to the Blairsville dentist by walking about a mile and a half outside of town square from the hotel I was staying.  We were hoping for the best but the dentist confirmed it was the worst case scenario.  A complete vertical fracture of tooth #15.  Some x-rays were taken and it showed the roots on the tooth are very long, extending up to, or near, the sinus cavity.  Based on this, the dentist advised the extraction be done by an oral surgeon.  Blairsville, being a small town, did not have an oral surgeon residing there.  Dentist said one comes in about twice a week as needed.  In consulting with the dentist, I made the decision to return home as quickly as possible to have the procedure done as I’ll be in the comfort of home and have family and friends available in the event of any complications.  Not sure yet on the length of recovery process to allow a return to the trail.  I will probably know more after the procedure on Friday.  The plan is for the adventure to continue after this minor setback is put behind us.

Wednesday I had to scramble to get transportation to the airport.  It wasn’t cheap, but a trail runner going by the name of Splitter provided a 2-hour ride most of the way to Atlanta and dropped me off at the MARTA.  From there, I took a train to the Airport which was way cheap, only $3.50.  I had booked a flight departing at 4:35 PM since I wasn’t sure when/how I’d get to the airport.  Once there about 11:15, way early, I paid Delta’s flight change fee to catch the 12:15 to Cleveland.  When entering the tarmac to the plane I noticed what appeared to be a familiar face.  Just 3 people ahead of me was a friend and member of my former team at my previous employer.  Mike M. was sure surprised when I said, “Hey, is that you?”  Mike kindly captured the moment on social media.  He was returning from New Orleans.

Nephew Rob picked me up at Cleveland’s airport, swung by my routine dentist to get referral for oral surgeon, and then arrived home about 3:30.  Today (Thursday) will be a relaxing day around the house to ensure I do not complicate the tooth issue seeing I’m less than 24 hours away from having it addressed.
Stay tuned, the adventure will continue!","Neel Gap

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587370,"Good news, the adventure continues as I’m heading back to the AT on Saturday, April 28!  Airplane lands in Atlanta about 8:00 AM and hoping to get an honest day’s hiking in the books by nightfall.

Been off the AT since April 10, having last hiked to Neel Gap on April 9.  Needed to return home to address a cracked molar.  I’m happy to report this has been resolved and with a week having passed, all looks well.  I’ll be returning to the trail on the 28th and begin hiking from the outfitter Mountain Crossings.  This is the precise location I was picked-up and taken to Blairsville, GA to assess my tooth issue.  Before venturing on, I’ll be picking up camp stove fuel and some food items.  The trail leads onward right from the back of Mountain Crossings.

I’ve been checking the weather in the area that I’ll be resuming my adventure and apparently I didn’t miss a thing.  In my absence, the lousy weather has persisted and remained less than desirable for hiking.  Perhaps there was a silver lining in my setback after all.  I’m hoping upon my return the sun finally comes out in Georgia!

For those of you following the adventure using The A.T. Guide (Northbound), I’ll be adding detail to my journal entries to ensure you know precisely where I’m at.  We’ll count off the miles together.  For example, I’m returning to Neel Gap listed on page 9, northbound (NoBo) mile 31.1.

To make the best of the non-hiking time I’ve done an assessment of my gear and have made the following changes.

Additions:  Tweezers for ticks, head warmer, bandana, light shorts, sock liners with toes (blister prevention) and another pair of leggings.  Light shorts and leggings will be my hiking attire of choice in place of the hiking pants that are convertible to shorts.  The hiking pants will remain in my gear for the time being.

Subtractions:  Pair of casino dice (sorry Thomas K.), safari hat (not breathable, replaced by baseball cap), back pack brain (excess storage), all-purpose knife (replaced by single-blade with plastic handle saving 2.5 oz.) and phone charger weighing 2.8 oz. (will re-acquire if needed).

Modifications:  Shortened tent stakes saving 1.7 oz.  Eliminated excess straps/cases saving 6.8 oz.  Carrying only one fourth of guidebook at a time, saving 6 oz.  Although these weights seem tiny, no need to carry them up mountains!

An oversight on my part, I forgot to mention my starting body weight back on April 6 was 215.0 lbs.  Apparently, my metabolism and appetite kicked into high gear on only four days of hiking as I’m now 209.5.  I hope to have access to a scale periodically to allow for reporting future changes in weight.
Check back soon as I’ll be journaling the next entry on my AT adventure, including new photos, around May 1.  Until then, take caution with anything called beef jerky!",,View Entry,"Apr 20, Fri",0

Up at 3 AM to catch a 6 AM flight to Atlanta. Arrived about 8 AM and headed to MARTA where Splitter picked me up and drove me to Neel Gap. Exact place I left AT on the 9th. Started hiking about 1:45 and eventually tagged along with a father and son duo from Kentucky. Hiked with them all day getting in 11.5 miles to Low Gap Shelter. We arrived in camp 7:45 so it was rush rush to setup tent and eat dinner. We hiked late since the prior shelter was 1.2 miles off the main trail. We didn't want to add 2.4 round trip since it was only about 4 more miles to Low Gap. An aggressive day but worth it! And I didn't freeze at night.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588658,"This was the most challenging day of the adventure. It was as though we were going no where but up, up, and more up. When in reality there were downhills buy they simply were too infrequent to reward us for our climbing efforts. Mark seemed to be the one of us three having the worst of it. But we must give him due credit because as a team we made great miles today in unfavorable terrain. The final climb was about 1000 feet. We camped atop Rocky Mountain in a small camping area. We were the first to stop here so we took the two prime camp sites. Only a couple more decided to join us but they were far enough away to not be noticed. Jeff made a fire and they tried to coax me from my tent, but with the effort put forth today, I stayed in my tent to rest. For book followers, we ended at mile 53.7 page 12. Tomorrow begins with a large downhill. That's a great way to start a hike!","Low Gap Shelter
",Rocky Mountain,"Apr 29, Sun",11.10
Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588749,"Today's terrain was a mix of ups and downs.  We (Jeff and Mark) ended on a long downhill to setup camp at Addis Gap (mile 63.6 page 13 in guide book).  We were the only ones that stayed in the camping area.  To get water, we had to walk half a mile down a dirt road to a small creek.  They went first while I watched over our gear and setup my tent.  When I headed down to get water, I met a husband and wife couple from Alabama (settled there after many years of Army travel) that were doing a section hike.  Forgive me for not getting their names.  I did share my online trail journal with them.  If you're reading, please post your names in the guest book.  He was also 50 and recently retired from the Army with 30 years of service.  He was a Colonel and served as a Tank Commander.  They were doing a hike in hopes of learning some skills for tackling the entire AT sometime in the future.  We talked briefly about my being from Ohio, why I was hiking, and of course, being Veterans we spoke of our service in the military.  They asked if I needed anything and I was fine at that time.  I've found it's very common for hikers doing sections only to ask any through-hikers if they need anything.
I had gotten some severe leg cramps the night before while changing clothes in the tiny tent.  When I mentioned this to Jeff, he was kind enough to provide me with electrolyte tablets for the next couple days.  At camp, I made a Knorr rice dish and this was great!  I had been eating cold meals for two days.  Mostly from being too exhausted to take the time to cook a proper meal.  Jeff and Mark shared a spaghetti dinner with instant mashed potatoes mixed in.  They seemed to be in heaven with the meal.
There was an owl nearby most of the night and apparently it was in a talking mood.  All night I heard it shouting out ""Who...Who"" with some screeches mixed in.  I'm no owl expert, but by the sound of screeches I bet it stood six foot tall, had a 9 foot wingspan and was on the prowl for unattended backpacks while hikers slept.  Luckily, mine was beside my tent and under the rain cover and survived the night.  In the morning, about 6:30, I heard a chirp...chirp...chirp, then a pause and a repeat.  This was so perfect I swore it was someone's alarm.  But, after a few minutes I noticed only two chirps and so it was only some exotic bird of Georgia.  We all thought for sure the sounds where too precise to be from a bird.  Needless to say, we were up early this morning.","Rocky Mountain
",Addis Gap,"Apr 30, Mon",9.90
Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588756,"Today was an early start due to the Georgia alarm clock bird waking us up long before we were ready.  The hike started with a climb and let me tell you, it's not the best way to get warmed-up.  The only reward is knowing that you may be putting yourself in a position to finish the day going downhill.  In this case, that was true as we were only going to be hiking 5.5 miles to Dick's Creek Gap (mile 69, page 13 in the guidebook).  This was the exit point for Mark and Jeff as they were only doing a section hike.  While hiking today, I was often in the middle and had time to discuss a few things with Jeff.  We talked about my love for eating vegetables with only salt and vinegar.  He thought that was strange but seemed interested in giving it a try.  We eventually moved on to talk about pickles and how I was known as 'Pickle Pete' as a child for my love of pickles.  Next thing I know, we were both craving one of those single pack pickles you find at gas stations or small convenience stores.  My mind was made up, I'd be sure to get some pickles in town.  When you hike you talk about many things, most of which could be considered odd.
Since they were stopping at Dick's Creek Gap where they had already left a car, they had asked me the day before my plans and offered a ride into Hiawassee.  Of course, I was grateful and jumped at the change to get to a trail town after hiking close to 40 miles over the previous 3.5 days. It was a long downward decent to Dick's Creek Gap and we were all happy when we started hearing auto traffic signaling were we just about there.
We packed into their vehicle and made the short trip to Hiawassee where they dropped me at the Budget Inn.  I overheard them saying they were going to stop to get something to eat as Father took Son back to his car which was in town verses at the trail head.  It's never been easy for me to say goodbye when you make a bond with others, and here was no different. Being alone in the woods is not easy and for them to let me tag along for three and a half days was truly a blessing.  Especially seeing that they were on a Father and Son adventure.  Listening to them over the time we shared reminded me of the times I spent fishing and gardening with my Father, times I'll always cherish. I shared my trail journal info with them and hope they stop in to read a bit or two.  Mark and Jeff, I'm very thankful for your kindness and sharing in the adventure.  I wish you two the best and be sure to go on more Father and Son adventures!  For me, I can only hope to find others like you along the trail.
After checking in I took a shower and had one thing on my mind, time for some real food.  I headed over to Zaxby's, a place I'd never been, and got a grilled chicken salad and a limeaid for a drink.  Although I was full, that didn't last long.  I headed over to Rite Aid and bought the only variety of pickles they had.  I even had to ask for them since I couldn't find them.  A 24 ounce jar of kosher spears.  Guess what, I ate the entire jar within 4 hours and even drank all the pickle juice, yum yum!  I also ate a noodle bowl that I could cook in the hotel room's microwave.  I took a two hour nap and then did laundry in the 4 unit facility at the hotel.  Then, with hunger returning, I headed down to Ingles grocery store and did some shopping for evening meal and some trail items.  I bought some electrolytes to add to my water to help prevent cramps and some turkey smokies and two packs of ramen noodles.  For my evening meal, that was sushi and sliced cucumber.
You're not gonna guess what happened and you won't believe it but it's true.  After I finished my meal I realized I lost the filling in the tooth located next to the one I had pulled back on April 13th.  I have to ask, am I hiking the AT or am I on the Appalachian Dentistry Tour?  There was nothing I could do being late at night.  Luckily no pain, so I quickly searched for a dentist and saw one .5 miles away that opened at 8 AM.  That would be the first order of business on Wednesday morning.","Addis Gap

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589185,"Picking up where we left off with the tooth issue, I was at the dentist office at 8 AM when they opened. I explained my situation and they were able to see me at 9:30. Dr. Mike and staff from Worthy Family Dentistry had me good to go by 11. The following day I was on the trail by 9:30 and busted out a distance of 16 plus miles. This was my longest day to date. I fell once coming down a decline when my ankle gave out and the trekking pole failed to do its job. Minor knee scrap like the ones we've all had as kids. Right back up and on the move only to later realize I lost a glove in the tumble. Too late to go back now. I managed to say goodbye to Georgia and cross into North Carolina. One state down with many more to go. Stayed in a shelter and met fellow hikers Lost Boy, Ballflap, Cajun Fire and Brenna. Lost Boy was so named for going backwards on the trail over two miles before realizing his mistake. On the trail its not too hard to leave camp in the morning and head the wrong direction. Just remember, a left into clamp, a left out of camp and vice versa for taking a right into camp. And in the next entry, Dale finally gets his trail name!

I guess I want the adventure to just reveal itself as I hike on down the trail. And so this day was going great, busting out mile after mile. I had heard hikers at the shelter saying there'd be one long climb today. Shame on me for not making note of that. After the easy miles where all I had to worry about were imaginary trolls in portions of trail that looked like tunnels, Albert Mountain showed up! I had been going up for quite awhile, thinking I'd be summitting soon enough when I looked ahead and seen the unthinkable. As if I was King Kong about to scale a building, the mountain turned straight up. I nearly fell backwards twice as I moved half a step at a time. Portions were more like rock climbing. Out of gas, out of breath except for some choice words not to print here, I finally made it! Not until I conquered this mountain did I realize there was a fire tower atop Albert. The view was 360 degrees and amazing. There were even helicopters I could hear but not see. Obviously they were below my horizon and blended in with the surrounding mountain sides. Luckily the backside of the mountain was a piece of cake. It was a slow steady decent to Long Branch Shelter. I walked into camp as a late comer and said, ""Jawz mad!"" Oh, about that trail name.

This morning's hike was only 7.2 miles. I needed to get some supplies and would then take a nero day. That's hiker lingo for a short mileage day. I secured a bunk at the Gooder Grove Hostel. This would be my first ever hostel so I wasn't sure what to expect. Cheaper than a motel but it was vastly better. Had access to kitchen, two bathrooms, living room and dining room. I walked into town before returning to lounge on the couch and do some journaling. In the evening I went to the Lazy Hiker Brewery with Travis and had a beer and 3 tacos from a food truck. We then stopped for ice cream before returning to hostel. My room had beds for 5 but I was the only hiker in the room. Acquired plenty of tips from hostel staff Mule and Zen. Cajun Fire found her way to the hostel shortly after me. There were about 5 of us there. In the morning I'd be heading out hoping for a big mileage day to offset the nero.

Spending some time at the hostel put pep in my step. I was moving on the relatively flat areas l like a rabbit running from a hawk. With the many flatter areas today, I hiked over 20 miles. Since Andrew is on the $20, that's a Andy day! Along today's hike I came across about 20 senior citizens coming down a mountain. It was great to see them being active. Today included two big mountains, one just before arriving at the shelter. At the peak I found Lost Boy overlooking a nice view. Once at the shelter I met Turtle and The Dragon. A pair of 70 year olds, friends since high school, doing a 3-4 day section hike. That was great to share in their experence as they shared some life stories. I shared the shelter with them that night and Lost Boy chose to setup a tent. In the morning I was last to leave camp. Eventually passed the long time friends and wished them well.

The Nantahala Outdoor Center was the destination as it sits right on the trail and gives hikers a taste of normal life. Here you can do kayaking and white water rafting if you so chose to do so. Also a general store and outfitters shop for any needs. For me it was a chance to get some hot food and a drink other than water. Lost Boy and I got our fill. There was also a lounge area near the river that we hikers monopolized. So after lunch I rested and dipped my sore feet in the ice cold river for about 20 minutes. I wasn't eager to move as a 3,000 foot climb resided between the NOC and the next shelter. But, it was time to get moving once again even though the riverside was more appealing. Upward I moved and quickly it became a snail's pace. All the way up I was burping up my lunch from the heat and being totally exhausted. Hence, this mountain will be forever known as Cheeseburger Mountain with Fry in my memories. At the shelter met Josh and Adrianna. They were doing a section hike to Fontana Dam. Josh kindly pointed out I wasn't utilizing the shoulder adjustments on my pack. With that tip I'm looking for better balance on the inclines.

As I came down closer to the road I saw a small parking lot with two tables. I said that looks like a good spot for lunch. Then I moved even closer and found fresh fruit waiting for me. An apple and banana sure hit the spot and made for a great lunch! Just like one of my favorite 80's video games Donkey Kong Junior where fruit gets dropped on the snap-jaws.

I indulged with a sausage with sauerkraut and a hot dog with onions, relish and ketchup. Later I put down a large bag of bugles. Of course before all that I got a jar of pickles. I ate only half and shared the rest with my trail buddies. Eventually we had to get back to the hiker's life and shuttled back to the trail and hiked 1.2 miles to the shelter.

Thomas K. always jabbered me beginning with ""Hey now..."" And so that became my bear defense. Whenever I was hiking alone I would loudly say ""hey now"" to alert any bears I was coming through, especially as I was rounding corners. Coincidence or not I seen no bears and I was happy with that. Our day included a two hour stay at Standing Bear Farm. This place was way out there. It was your back country hostel with an honor system. I had two V8's, a Gatorade, Slim Jim and peanut butter crackers, totalling $6.25. Others enjoyed pizza and beer. Z, not to be confused with AZ, paid to spend the night in their tree house. Earlier in the morning I rolled my left ankle and face planted into the AT. Nothing I could do but walk it off and about an hour later it felt fine. I did lose my BDU bandana in the tumble though.

We had a deal that if he still worked at Wendy's that he'd have to quit and go with me on the AT. I'm happy to say Chris completed schooling and is working in the HVAC field. Great work for a Packers fan! Well, Chris likes to always say it's glorious. But sometimes it ain't so. Having left the Smokies I stopped saying ""hey now"" and I'm sure you can guess the rest of the story. Within two hours of my day's hike, I rounded a corner and two bear cubs were on the trail about 120 feet in front of me. I froze in my tracks! Thinking only of the 1% of encounters that end bad. One went up a tree real quick, the other looked at me. Finger Licking came around the corner and when I told her two bears were in the trail they both took off down the side of the mountain. I didn't see where momma bear was and that concerned me. But we moved forward without issue and saw no trace of them when we passed their last known location. My adventure now includes seeing bears in the wild. By the time I reached camp it started to rain. I quickly setup my tent and was in it by 5 PM. I came out at 8:30 to hang my food on a cable, returned to my tent without dinner and stayed there until about 9 AM. It rained all night and was still raining.

You can manage to keep most things dry but it's inevitable that you're going to end up packing a wet, dirty tent into your pack. And that's how the day started. MF Mouse and I were the only ones left in camp from our group. Nothing we could do but break camp and move toward town with visions of a hot shower and a dry bunk at a hostel. We hiked in mud and half inch deep water on most of the trail. Even uphill and downhill the water was there. My streak of no rain since returning to the AT April 28th was officially over. Like anything, you learn to adapt. Once soaked and shoes full of mud, the hiking got easier as there was nothing to avoid anymore. We reached town about 2:30 which was about the time the rain stopped. The day was looking better but we couldn't find a pet friendly place to stay. You see, MF Mouse is hiking with his German shepherd named Terra. I found a hostel for me and took a shower then hit the diner for chicken fingers with fries and a salad. Mouse was contemplating returning to the trail. Now Hot Springs is smaller than my home town of Sheffield Lake so it didn't take me long to locate the rest of the group I've been hiking with the past couple weeks. The sun even came out at times and I learned MF Mouse found a place for him and Terra. Soon we were all on a patio overlooking a river and having a good time. The day was now great. We all went to dinner at the creekside restaurant. A local gentleman even gave up his table to allow us to put two tables together. Southern hospitality surfaces yet again. After dinner I went back to the hostel and did laundry to clean all my wet hiking clothes. I was also expecting to pickup my first care package the following day.

There was a possibility it would arrive on the late morning truck. The office would be closed 11:30 to 1:00. Therefore, I asked they forward to Erwin, TN. I did my resupply at the local outfitters and headed back to the trail about 9:45. It was an immediate climb out of Hot Springs and I was at it alone. The rest of the group was ahead of me since I was waiting for post office to open. Most of the day I hiked alone but we had plans to meet at a hostel when the day's miles were behind us. Finding the hostel was not easy. I probably walked two extra miles on roads that don't count in my total. We stayed at Hemlock Hallow, an excellent place I completely recommend. I had weighed myself at the outfitters in the morning but didn't believe the scale. The scale at the hostel confirmed it. I've lost 30 pounds since April 6th! I'm down to 185 from 215. Other hikers have said I'm not eating enough and this proves them correct. I'll have to step up my calorie intake in the morning and during hiking time.

Although it didn't rain much, it was an overcast day with fog high up in the mountains which limited the lofty views. Today was a great day as far as my energy goes. I kept pace with everyone even on the climbs where I tend to fall behind. I'm sure this is due to not eating enough. At the hostel the night before I did enjoy a whole pizza and four Gatorades. Perhaps this helped with today's energy. I crossed over 300 miles hiked for my AT adventure. I've been making great miles since my return from taking time off to address the molar I cracked back on April 8th. 300 miles puts me about 14% complete, still a long ways to go. Four of us stayed at another hostel (Nature's Inn) ran by a wonderful woman named Sara. This is three days in a row for hostel stays but that is due to a bad stretch of weather. No need to camp in rain if it can be avoided. For dinner she had made spaghetti with meat sauce and it was awesome! Remined me of my mother's. Other foods I had were two bags of chips, cheese danish, mini pecan pie, an orange and a large coffee. When Sara dropped us off at the trail, she gave each of us a hug and said, ""Take it down the trail with you."" I've still not had an energy drink since hiking and I used to drink one almost every day. I don't really miss them and I know if I bought one I'd drink it to fast to enjoy it.

When the four of us were dropped off by Sara we met up with the rest of the group that chose to stay in the shelter the night before. It was nice to reunite so quickly. The skies threatened rain but to this point we were doing just fine. But then while hiking with MF Mouse and Terra we heard the wind start to zip through the trees and it grew louder with the passing of each second like a fast approaching train. Well, I knew better than this. I've heard this sound all to often fishing Lake Erie. Its the sound of rain hitting either water or leaves and it keeps getting louder and louder until it consumes you. I said to Mouse, ""That's not the wind!"" There was no time to stop to put on rain gear but luckily my pack's rain cover was on as a precaution. Immediately it was a cold downpour and I was soaked head to toe in a matter of minutes. Just as quick I'm now hiking uphill in a stream of water coming down the trail. The rain was over in about 20 minutes but the damage was done. Slowly things improved as I dried out over the next several hours. About 1.5 miles from our shelter destination I came upon two of my group taking a break atop Bald Mountain as the view was beautiful. My interest was peaked as they were eating apples. Before I could even set my pack down, a woman approached saying I get the consolation prize. She handed me a big cold strawberry. Then she returned with an apple. She was one of three sisters enjoying lunch atop the mountain. My apple core looked like a toothpick when I was done. I didn't rest long as I heard thunder and saw the dark clouds behind me. I made a dash to the shelter and was the first of 10 to arrive. We were maxed out! I ate, changed into dry clothes and into a warm sleeping bag by 7:30.

From a hiker's perspective, I ate a small breakfast and packed one of my pockets with some snacks. With the city of Erwin being today's goal I wasn't planning on stopping for a lunch, I was hoping to have that in town. I left camp about 7:00 fully expecting muddy trails from overnight rain and hiked alone quite awhile until Jelly Bean caught up. From that point forward we were within eyesight of each other until the last hour of hiking. Jelly Bean is retired Army and has been very kind with his hiking advice and even gave me some food to try. I may not see him again as he's doing his hike in sections and is jumping up north. Thanks JB. Happy trails to you! It never did rain and the trail conditions improved the closer I got to Erwin. Most of the miles were downhill and yet tough as my energy was low. About a couple hours from Erwin I decided to make the following day a zero day (no hiking) to rest. On the final decent I stopped and chatted with a 71 year old woman for 15 minutes. She was hiking up the mountain, was an avid day hiker, and her favorite area is the Smoky Mountains. She goes by Walking Map. As we said our goodbyes, she asked my trail name and if she could include me in her mourning prayers. I said that would be nice. Excitedly I pressed onward as I could see the road below through the trees. Now I'd hiked nearly 17 miles this day through mud, irregular rocks, exposed roots and all other sorts of forest debris, and managed to escape without incident. When I exited the trail, happy the day's hiking was over, not ten steps onto a blacktop road I stepped to close to the edge, rolled my left ankle and fell into the ditch! I was like a turtle lying on its back. My pack protected my backside but my right knee (see photos section if you'd like) wasn't so lucky. It scraped the edge of the blacktop and was already red from bleeding. No stitches needed, just left some skin on the side of the road. After coming to my senses and getting upright I walked about 100 feet to a hostel where my group was already enjoying ice cold drinks and making accommodations in town. I chose to stay at Super 8 in my own room. They were moving on the next day. Therefore, it's not clear if or when I'll see them again. But, the trail is full of hikers and the next chapter of this adventure could simply bring new characters.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591712,"When I left the Super 8 this morning to head back to hiking it didn't feel quite right. The left ankle I rolled two days before was still slightly swollen, but was fine for hiking. The scraped knee was almost 48 hours into healing and looked good. I had spent $7 on large bandages at the drug store and the first one I tried to apply didn't stick at all. Into the garbage it went and I began hiking with nothing on the knee. The thing that felt the most different was knowing my day's hike was all my own. There would be no meeting up with the group I'd been hiking with for roughly two weeks. My initial sadness was replaced with a sense of relief as I realized this day was entirely mine. I could go as far, as fast, or as slow as I chose. My goal was to get to Cherry Gap Shelter, a hike of 17 miles, then assess the rest of the day from that point. It hadn't rained during the day but we've been on a stretch of daily rain for about a week. The shelter had spots available and 17 miles was a good hike and that convinced me to stay the night right there. Turns out I made the right decision. Within a couple hours the rains came and during the night it really came down hard. Z, I've since learned his full trail name is The # Z, had made it to the shelter as well and that was comforting having a known hiker to chat with. There was also trail magic today. A man was setup at a road crossing with snacks. I indulged in banana bread, a brownie and sweet tea. He said he does trail magic three or four days a week.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591716,"It didn't only rain most of the night. It was raining when I awoke around 7 AM. I was in no mood to hike in rain again. Z was up and moving around that time and he moved out about 8 AM. Sure, this made me feel like a wimp, but I despise rain on the trail. Moments after he left I noticed the rain stopped so I started my morning routine and was hiking by 9 AM. If it rains once I'm on the trail, so be it. Before leaving I heard one hiker say he awoke in his tent to find out he was floating in two inches of water. Apparently he setup his tent in a location without a drainage channel. Reassurance to me that staying in the shelter last night was the right call. Today was going to be an aggressive hike of 19 miles. But, Z had mentioned the destination shelter was the highest one elevation-wise on the entire AT.  He is full of these types of facts. And there were going to be some great views along the way. I must have missed those. Add to that climbing a mountain that seemed to go up, up, and up yet again, made for a tiring and fustrating hike. With the late start and long miles I didn't get to the shelter until 5:15. Z greeted me with, ""This place is a dump!"" It may have been. But it was a roof over my head and Z and I were the only two there, giving us choice of spots. To me that's a reason for celebration. He took one corner, me the opposite. Eventually others arrived and we had six on the first floor. Two others went upstairs and listening to them proved it was not ideal. Another looked up there and came down saying she'd rather tent. The elevation lived up to its reputation. While in my sleeping bag I saw fog, or was that clouds, coming through the window. Made no difference to me as I was both dry and warm. There was also cause for celebration earlier in the day. Trail magic again! This time I had two bags of chips, a Gatorade and a pickle. Yes, pickle! She had a whole jar, imagine that.

The good thing was I was headed straight downhill for awhile which was the counterpart to yesterday ending with a serious climb. As I moved down the mountain the weather improved as the elevation dropped. Soon I was in the sun as it was coming over the adjacent mountains. It now felt like a fine spring day, sunny with a brisk wind. The views at my new elevation were great. As the hike progressed I was slowly moving uphill again and by the time I reached the peaks of the local bald mountains, it felt like a winter day. The wind was cold but my exerted energy kept me somewhat warm. The sky was covered with no hint there was a sun. I could actually see mist or clouds being blown up the sides of the mountains and passing in front of me. These tops were mostly tall grass, few if any trees. Visability was limited as you couldn't even see where the trail was headed beyond about 100 yards. That scene went on for about two hours. After flattening out the trail started a decline for the next five miles. Soon the sun reappeared and it now felt like summer was rolling in.

When I was ready to head back to the trail, there was no hostel employee around to shuttle me the seven-tenths of a mile. That might seem insignificant but walking with a backpack on a highway with traffic going 55+ MPH is not safe. My impatience got the best of me so I walked down highway 19E. The sun was out in full force but with it being just after 8 AM there was still plenty of dew along the trail passing through grassy meadows. My shoes were soaked within the hour. Once the meadows were behind me the terrain was favorable for today's goal of hiking 18 miles. There were two water falls in today's adventure. See the Photos section for a picture of the Jones Falls. The second wasn't as spectacular. The adventure has also surpassed 400 miles. That's a long distance but still less than 20% complete. The miles do seem to be getting easier and faster though. The sun was out most of the day but it started to drizzle as I approached the shelter. I quickened my pace the final decent and arrived with barely any evidence I'd been in the rain which threatened then vanished. When I arrived I was greeted by a new hiker in my adventure. He has no trail name and is legally named Tom. We were the only two there and that afforded me a prime spot in a shelter meant for six. My red bandana that MF Mouse gave me was missing. I must have dropped it just as I began my dash to the shelter. Well, I wasn't going back uphill for it. I told Tom maybe someone would pick it up for me. About 30 minutes later I see the color red coming down the final approach to the shelter. The hiker who recognized me the night before, the one from Westlake, was kind enough to pick it up and bring it to the shelter. He took a short break then continued down the trail.

Z was already out in front of me and Tom was ready to leave momentarily. Trouble left long before us all having chosen to eat cold cereal on the go. Rain was looming but it's always easier to start hiking before the rain rather than leave the comforts of a dry shelter if the rain has already started. Within 20 minutes I had to stop to put on my pack's rain cover. And 20 minutes after that it was raining enough to remove any hopes of staying dry today. Little did I know it was going to rain consistently all day. My thoughts were on reaching the Boots Off Hostel 15 miles away. It was the only thing keeping me going on the sloppy trail. Before I left for the AT, people had asked how do you know where to go. The AT is marked with white blazes on trees, posts, rocks and sometimes roads. You just follow them. A blaze is roughly the size and shape of a Hershey candy bar. Blue blazes are side trails and can be very short in length to very long. The only time I'm on a trail marked with blue blazes is to get to a water source or to a shelter not directly on the AT. Well, I had been following the trail along the river for awhile when I realized I'd seen two blue blazes in a row. How could this be? There wasn't a spilt in the trail. I headed backwards and ran into an older gentleman with an accent and asked him for clarification. He was certain we were on the right trail as he also saw no alternative route. I turned around and headed in the initial direction but when I saw the third and fourth blue blaze I knew something was amiss. When doubling back I told the gentleman I'm going back to the last white blaze I saw. He continued down the side trail. Last thing I wanted to do is hike extra miles in rain but I needed to be sure. When I arrived at the last white blaze I could now see the trail went straight down the side of cliff and slightly backwards. This is why I missed it as it headed downward to Laurel Falls. I was relieved and felt for the other guy going the wrong way but he was on his own now. The trail was extremely tough over the next half mile. I fell twice and slipped, nearly falling two more times. One of the falls put me half over the edge. I managed to stop my momentum by placing my hand on an eight inch diameter log on the side of the cliff. Honestly, this was the first time I was afraid for my safety. After the treacherous section I caught up with Z. Turns out he came across the same gentleman I did and he was going southbound rather than northbound on the white blaze trail. Z got him going in the right direction. The side trail the gentleman took bypassed the Laurel Falls, probably due to it being too treacherous for some and put him ahead of me. I passed him later and we talked briefly of what occurred. Finally I reached the hostel only to find out no space was available. Z was going back to the trail but I wanted to dry out. Luckily I was able to arrange a shuttle to another hostel 2.5 miles away. Our mysterious gentleman with the accent had arrived, sat next to me and said, ""You go I go with you."" I had the chance to get to know him over the next several hours. His name is Erich and he's from Switzerland. He's retired and came to America to hike the AT. We went to Subway for dinner and it was his first trip to the franchise. I helped him put in his order since his accent and unfamiliarity with Subway confused the sandwich maker.

Its tough to beat a real breakfast when on the trail. I've been eating granola bars. I proceeded over to Dollar General to get some food for the day and the trail. In these small towns, DG's are a hiker's goldmine. Its common to see a hiker sitting outside the store resupplying his/her pack. After spending the rest of the off day at the hostel watching VHS tapes (yes, old school!), it was time to continue with the adventure.
We've been battling rain for nearly two weeks now. I think there's been only one 24 hour period in which it didn't rain. When I hit the trail the rain clouds could be seen in the distance. About three hours into the hike the rain started. Slowly at first but then came the medium-heavy rain which wasn't going to let up. I had a distance goal in mind and when achieved I'd determine if I wanted to over extend to the next shelter since Damascus, VA, was getting close. With the rain showing no signs of letting up and only two hikers in the first shelter, this was where I ended for the day. Now that I'd stopped hiking, the chill set in so I quickly changed into dry clothes and crawled into my mummy bag to get warm. I was pretty much in my bag until the following morning.

When I awoke about 6:15 AM it was not raining but it looked as though it could start at any time. I had an ambitious goal in mind for today. Would I have it in me to hike into Damascus, VA? Doing so would mean hiking just shy of 26 miles. It would be a personal best and there was a good chance of becoming soaked yet again. To mentally prepare I broke the day down into sections. There'd be two shelters to pass, one at 7.6 and another at 15.9 miles, and the TN-VA border at 22.4 miles. These would allow me to focus on milestones and estimate my arrival times. The hike started at 7:10 AM and I figured I could be there between 6 to 7 PM. There was one variable out of my control that would be a huge factor, that pesky rain! And so I was heading down the trail thinking of town food and a dry bunk this evening. I made the first shelter ahead of schedule and kept on moving. I arrived at the second at 1:01 PM, one minute past my estimate. I'd allotted 30 minutes to rest and eat lunch. For lunch I had some beef jerky and a drink consisting of two Carnation instant breakfasts and a pack of instant oatmeal. I'd need the calories to push my limits. In reviewing my guide I estimated I'd hit the border at 4:30, then 3.6 miles to go from there. I kept repeating aloud as I hiked, ""4:30 to the border, 3.6 to go."" I made the border just before 4:00. Then I calculated it would be another hour and 20 minutes to town. The terrain became mostly downhill, common for entering a town, and I hit town precisely at 5:00. From there the trail actually follows streets. I attempted to call the hostel to check on a bunk but no cell signal. As I walked through town I hoped the Hikers Inn would have a vacancy. The hostel sits right off the main road going through town. As I approached I saw a couple sitting on the porch. I said, ""Hi, are you the owners of this fine establishment?"" They were. There wasn't a bunk but someone had just cancelled on the private room with a queen bed. I said, ""I'll take the private room tonight and a bunk for tomorrow."" My ambitious goal paid off, I was good to go for the next day and a half. Oh, that pesky rain that could have put an end to my vision, amounted to no more than a drizzle for two hours spread out through out the day. That was manageable.

My niece Melanie did not believe me when I told her my adventure would include seeing wild ponies in Virginia. Well Mel, they are real and they are spectacular! You never knew when you'd see them. At one spot I rounded a corner in the brush and found two merely ten feet in front of me. As I was filming them eating grass it started to rain so I darted into the woods to hide under a pine tree. The rain came upon me really quick. I could see the two ponies, now about 30 feet away, and they just stood still in the rain like statues. The heavy rain subsided and I was only 45 minutes from the shelter so I continued onward. By the time I arrived at the shelter the sun was already out. At the shelter I meet a guy from Euclid, Ohio. He was hiking with his adult daughter. They were only hiking for a week though. He told me the ponies were just over by his campsite. That is where I spotted the mom and the fawn. They even wandered within feet of the shelter at various points in time. They were unphased by humans but the adults would move away if you approached them. The fawn came right to me, probably looking for a snack, then hurried back to mom's side.
Today was also the day I crossed over 500 adventure miles. The terrain in the state park was very rocky. But the wild ponies more than made up for that. So Mel, perhaps you and Harper can visit the ponies someday now that you're a believer! For book followers, mile 503.6 page 51.","Lost Mountain Shelter
",Wise Shelter,"Jun 01, Fri",17.50
Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592892,"The hike began early but most of the shelter guests had departed before me. As usual with the past couple weeks it was threatening rain again. It was foggy up on the mountain and the forest was dark and damp. I felt like a frog today hopping from rock to rock to avoid mud and standing water on the trail. These conditions seemed to go on forever. I just wanted good terrain under my feet. Eventually the terrain improved as I hiked down the mountain. Then the weather improved too and the sun made an appearance. It did not rain during my hike. News is spreading on the trail that we'll see sun for a week beginning Monday. I'm hoping that stays as the forecast and this daily rain ends for us hikers.
I'd gone two days without any cell service and was in need of it today. Up high on a ridge line I was able to get service. In came a photo from Mike U. enjoying the annual Tour de Fort bicycle event in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I attended last year but my adventure kept me away this year. Hope you all had a great time! I also texted my sister to mail my new shoes and some protein bars. The cell service was gone by the time I reached the shelter.
At the shelter I met the hiker with trail name Mammoth. He and Ray Ramono sound nearly identical. I believe Ray voices a woolly mammoth in a film, hence the trail name. Mammoth, sporting a full white beard, had lost his watch in the middle of the night. It fell between the outer rock wall and the planks of the shelter floor. He attempted in the night and again in the morning to fish out the watch. He said the watch was a lost cause and gave it up. Now I like a challenge, and to fish, and I said that if I get the watch its mine since he'd given up on it. He agreed. I could see the watch and went to my pack saying this calls for some Air Force ingenuity. Mammoth went to retrieve his food bag he'd hung the night before to prevent bears from getting to it. I used a tree limb to form a big check mark-like tool and a rubber band to hold the shape. I had the watch in less than 45 seconds. When Mammoth came back and asked about the watch, I simply said I was done looking for it. It was now time for some trail humor. Then I said I can't tell what time it is, my left watch says 6:53 and my right watch says 7:00. He caught on seeing his Casio on my right wrist. When I gave it to him he was very grateful and said thanks. It looked as though he thought I'd keep it since he'd given up on it. But, we all know the type of person I am and I simply said, ""You're welcome, always glad to help."" He asked my trail name again to be clear who it was that saved his watch. He called the saving of the watch trail magic. I wished him happy trails since I think I'm moving faster than Mammoth and may not see him again. I grabbed my pack and hit the trail aiming for the town of Atkins, Virginia. For book followers, mile 523.7 page 54.","Wise Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593444,"As I left the Trimpi shelter I had my sights sent on reaching Atkins, VA. It was a hike of 21 miles but nothing I haven't done before. And best of all with a town comes luxury. To a hiker the simplest things are big luxuries. There was yet another small chance of rain and at this point rain was the norm so it's impact would be minimal. While hiking I was hoping to reach a ridge to get cell service. I needed to contact my sister to have her mail my shoes to Pearisburg the following day. I've been moving quick and there was little room for delay.
If I reached Atkins I was planning on staying at the Relax Inn. As luck would have it, when cell service became available in came a text from MF Mouse saying he was already at the Relax Inn and he was staying there another night. I was welcome to the second bed if I reached Atkins. That was all the motivation I needed. It was Atkins or bust! Just before reaching town I came across a section of trail that was a boardwalk over a small swampy area. Too bad there wasn't more trail like this. I arrived at the inn, took a shower and headed to the Mexican restaurant within the Exxon gas station 100 yards from the inn. After I ordered the El Grande the rain came pouring down. Didn't matter now since I reached the comforts of town, albeit a small town like Atkins. The meal was the biggest Mexican dish I'd ever seen consisting of six items. Initially I thought it was too much. But no, a hiker can put down food like a competitive eater. And knowing I was heading to town, I didn't snack after lunch. I even ate all the ccomplimentary chips with a side of cheese dip. The food was excellent even though the restaurant was part of a gas station, who knew! The rain ended as quickly as it started and I was able to walk back to the inn rain free.
At the inn I did laundry and updated my journal while MF Mouse watched movies. The only food or drink I managed the rest of the day was a cold Budweiser. A nice way to finish a day of 21 miles hiked. For book followers, mile 545.1 page 55.","Trimpi Shelter

As I exited the Relax Inn I was greeted with the most beautiful blue sky I'd ever seen. There was only two things in the sky. The sun in the east and a half moon in the west. Not a cloud of any shape or size was visible. That wasn't all either. The temperature was awesome for hiking and there was a nice cool breeze. Mouse and I where aiming for a tenting spot along the river. Raccoon and Monk were aiming for the same spot. The tent was coming out of the backpack for the first time since May 15th. Yes, its been that long. I've been in a shelter, hostel or hotel for over two weeks. Mouse and I stopped for a 45 minute lunch, the longest one I've taken. We were overlooking the valley below and that added to the experience. The extended lunch gave me rest off my feet and helped make for a strong afternoon. We made our destination by the side of a river. Raccoon and Monk were there long before us. They swam, ate and were already in their tents. Most days I hike the majority of the day alone, meeting at the ending destination. Today was different as I was able to keep up with Mouse and his dog Terra the entire day.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593456,"For the second day in a row the weather was in a word, awesome. A cloud here and there but these where the high white clouds. It was once again perfect for hiking. The first eight miles went by fast and my energy was high. Then all of a sudden we came to a hill, my energy vanished, and the other three left me behind. My efforts to keep pace were useless. There was no gas in my tank. So I hiked at a slower pace and kept moving, stopping only to drink some water or wipe sweat from my face. I knew that I'd eventually catch up to the others as they planned to take an 11:30 lunch. I came across them at noon sitting on large rocks near the top of a mountain. Prior to that I had decided I'd find a spot in full sun and take my lunch there. As I passed the three I told them my plans and said I'd give it an hour to find a sunny spot. Good thing I decided to wait, for at 12:30 I came across the unexpected. I seen a road at the bottom of the mountain and there was a white truck parked there. Then two tables and three individuals caught my attention. They were Amish and had setup a road side, or in this case, trail side stand. They owned a store not far from there. The food wasn't free but the prices were great. I had the grumbellies coming down the mountain and it was time to feed the hunger. I had a cheeseburger with all the toppings on homemade sourdough bread, not one but two hot dogs with chilli and onions, two ice teas, a Gatorade and a snickers bar for a later snack. All this for $13.50 and the burger and dogs were grilled right in front of me. When Raccoon came down a little while later he said I must of had a sixth sense. Even though he ate lunch on the mountain he ordered up a cheeseburger after I told him how great they were. In talking with the Amish they relocated to the area from Ashland, Ohio. Yet another reminder of home. When I headed off to continue my hike Mouse had not yet came off the mountain. The four of us once again tented in the same spot near a small creek.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593469,"Today was a rare day in that we were able to take advantage of two small stores that were nearly on the trail. This allowed, or more appropriately, motivated us to have a big mileage day. We had a snack for breakfast then hiked about seven miles to Brushy Mountain Outpost where they had an indoor grill and a small menu. I chose to go with a combination of lunch and breakfast. I ordered a sausage biscuit and cheeseburger with cajun fries. I also had a can of V8 and a Gatorade. I met Swedee Pie here. He's a through hiker from Sweden. He didn't talk much and stayed to finish eating as we returned to hiking. I had seen him on the trail the past couple days and when I passed him all I received was a nod. Not a talkative guy.
With full tanks it was time to hike the miles to the next food stop, a grocery store with a small campground. It was a long day of hiking, one in which I hiked almost exclusively alone. Knowing others were heading to the same spot kept me going and eventually I arrived at the grocery store. I had to walk an extra half mile down a busy road but it was worth it. For a $6 fee you could setup your tent, take a shower and do laundry. And of course there was food in the grocery store. This was a very small store. A local sat outside sanding a walking stick. He talked my ear off while I waited for my supreme pizza to bake. Mouse and I split the pizza and a bag of chilli cheese corn chips. I washed it all down with a cold beer. I met another through hiker named Lost & Found. He's from Connecticut, a Yankees fan, and lives in Boston. That has to be rough seeing the sports rivalry the cities share. Raccoon (from California) and Monk (from New Jersey) were at the campground as well. Given the long miles and extra amenities, I still managed to get to sleep at a decent hour. To keep our food safe from bears and mice, we didn't hang the bags in trees, we all put them in a broken dryer, ha ha! Oh, and let's not forget to mention that we crossed over 600 miles hiked today!

It wasn't supposed to rain today. After I packed up my backpack I headed down to the grocery store for breakfast. I had a cinnamon roll, peacan twirls and a coffee while sitting inside talking with a few hikers. By the time I left the store, I'd day 45 minutes, the sky was now blue, all mist and fog was gone and the sun was out. We were setting up for another beautiful day.
I walked the half mile back to the trail and took a couple photos. By this time Mouse arrived with Terra and we began our hike. Within minutes Terra bolted from the trail to chase a deer. Mouse called her back, but only after the deer hit full stride and vanished before our eyes did she listen and return. About an hour into the hike Mouse let me go ahead of him and this was the last I'd see of him until the hostel.
I arrived at the Woods Hole Hostel early in the afternoon. There were options to tent or take a spot in the bunk house. I chose to tent given the nice weather, drying the morning's dew from the tent and my hopes of bunking at another hostel the following day in Pearisburg. Woods Hole is the oldest hostel on the AT. It's not a party hostel and I'm fine with that. Everything was on the honor system and you'd settle up before leaving. To tent, take a shower, drink two lemonades and eat one home made cookie only cost me $15. That's a steal! Normally there was a home cooked meal for an extra charge. But today in place of the meal we went to a Pearisburg restaurant.
Now here's the cool part. Fifteen hikers loaded into an SUV and a pickup truck and headed to town. I was in the back of the pickup with five others, one from New Zealand. Later I found out the SUV included a woman from Norwalk, Ohio. We paraded into the restaurant in a single file line where they had already setup tables for us. Apparently, this happens often. I had cheese fries for an appetizer, chicken parmesan with spaghetti and broccoli. Then I bought a whatchamacallit candy bar for dessert. Honestly, I was still hungry and ate the big cookie when I arrived back at the hostel. In the morning I ate my own breakfast due to theirs coming with eggs. Those who know me know I despise eggs. I was the only one to skip the hostel's breakfast offer. I did drink the coffee though and it was great. The hostel had a community theme and we where all asked to do a chore before returning to the trail. They were written on clothes pins and ringed the lip of a mason jar. When the chore was done you dropped the pin into the jar. While everyone ate breakfast I took what is for me an easy task. I cleaned the toilet. The military didn't just teach me how to fix bombers. My fear of cleaning toilets ended in the late 80's. For book followers, mile 624.8 page 63.","VA 606, Trent's Grocery

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594288,"It was going to be a good day. How could it not be? I was only hiking 10.6 miles to get to Pearisburg. And I'd be staying at another hostel with access to town food. Must we not forget I had two packages waiting my arrival to the post office. And so I set out to hike at 9:00 AM.
As I approached the trail from the dirt road I came up to Swedee Pie, a 44 year old from Sweden. I've ran into him before only to get a nod or one to two words in return when I tried to engage conversation. However, this day was different. I yelled out as I approached, ""Swedee Pie!"" After exchanges of good morning, we started down the trail. For the next 45 minutes it was constant talking. I learned quite a bit about him and it made for quick and easy hiking until he darted into a shelter for a coffee break while I pressed onward. I said I hoped to see him in town.
My first stop was the post office. The box from my sister Laura had my new shoes, protein bars, protein powder and some Aleve tablets. While at the post office I mailed home my old shoes. No longer good for hiking but will make nice lawn and garden shoes. I put on my pack and started my way to the hostel wearing cheap sandals and carrying two boxes. The clerk at the post office told me the hostel was behind Food Lion. I saw nothing there, went to front of store, saw two employees taking a break and asked for directions. They said to go back and I'd find a path in the woods which was a shortcut. It was there and I found Angels Rest Hiker Heaven. Later MF Mouse, Raccoon, Monk and Lost & Found would arrive.
After showering I ate at a Chinese buffet, got some snacks at Food Lion and accepted an ivitatation to visit Dairy Queen with four hikers I met at the hostel. Two were from Germany. I had my favorite, a peanut buster parfait. When I left the comforts of being inside the AC, I seen Swedee Pie eating outside. We chatted and I said I'll show you the secret path to the hostel. I was fairly certain there were still bunks available. He was happy to land a top bunk in the bunk house.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594292,"It is only natural to want to plan your schedule. But on the trail we hikers are more of a day to day group. When you wake up you worry about today. Getting through today is tough enough to worry about tomorrow. Many times I've had to remind myself of this fact. For instance, after eight straight days of hiking I decided to take a rest day the morning I planned to leave. MF Mouse also rested and our biggest accomplisment of the day was walking to the Mexican restaurant for lunch. I had jalapeno poppers, three tamales and a grande mango frozen margarita. It was awesome! The remainder of the day we watched two movies and relaxed around the hostel.
Although hikers form friendships, they come and go. Raccoon did not take a rest day and left the day before. No telling when I'd see him again. Mouse told me he wasn't feeling well and would be taking yet another rest day with hopes of seeing a doctor on Monday. Then I found out Monk would not be continuing his hike. His girlfriend came from Italy two days before and they decided to catch an Amtrak to the west coast. Their adventure continures, not on trails, but on tracks. Best wishes Monk. Swedee Pie had also left the day before and Lost & Found decided to slack pack a day or two. Slack packing is hiking without most of your gear and only a day's food. You end up back at the hostel as they shuttle you up trail and you hike back in the opposite direction. I've yet to slack pack.
When the hostel shuttled me back to the trailhead I was hoping for a big day. It was over 90 miles to Daleville and I wanted to be there in five days. The day started good. At the trailhead a woman was doing trail magic. She gave me a Gatorade and a blueberry muffin. I noticed her car had Ohio plates. In chatting I learned she had ties to Lorain, Ohio, the town next to my hometown.
I found out why some were slack packing. This section of trail was rocky and rough on the feet and forced a slow pace. I made my big day but it took until 6:30. It had rained on the trail but in most areas it was before I went through. I only saw the mud puddles. So when I arrived at a shelter that was designated as closed for safety reasons, I was elated to find out others could care less and where going to stay there. The hazard was dead trees that were at risk of falling. Five of us stayed the night, stayed dry, and five of us made it through another day on the trail.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594298,"I wanted to have another big day in order to keep a pace that would make Daleville in five days. Yesterday my feet were aching most of the day. Today they felt much better even though the morning was more rocky terrain. I usually average 2.5 miles per hour over a mixture of trail conditions. But today at lunch I realized I'd only made 7.5 miles in four hours, less than two miles per hour.
Just before I took lunch I came out of the woods to a gravel road. Across the road reading a trail information sign was a group of about eight kids, one teenage girl, and one adult male. They were going on a mini adventure, good for the kids. What was potentially bad for me were the two large dogs that came running toward me while barking. I froze, touched my trekking poles to the ground, they investigated then left. Meanwhile, the owner didn't blink an eye nor did he put the dogs on a leash.
They left and I setup on a large rock for lunch. Sky Diver shortly joined me and I told him about my encounter. We went on to debate the potential negatives of dog owners not leashing their dogs while they are on the trail. (Note to reader, please remember this story for a later entry.)
After lunch the terrain eased and my pace quickened. I managed an 18.5 mile day before settling into a shelter at 6 PM. Here I met a hiker named Troop Leader. He's a former DEA agent, now retired. For this I was glad since I assumed he would not be partaking in herbal refreshments. There is more than just natural weeds on the trail, if you know what I mean.
Only Troop Leader and I used the shelter. Two others, Robin and Freight Train, opted to tent. I was in my sleeping bag early. The rocky terrain the past two days had taken its toll on me. For book followers, mile 674.3 page 67.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594302,"Overnight rain and a drop in temperature had arrived by the time my 6 AM alarm went off. I had a sense it was not going to be a good day. I heard rain hitting the shelter's roof. And with chill in the air I wasn't in any hurry of vacating a cozy sleeping bag. I dozed on and off for nearly three hours while hoping for the rain to stop. At just after 9 AM I figured I'd at least eat breakfast. I went and retrieved my food bag I hung the night before. To my amazement the ground was barely wet. It wasn't so much rain I heard, but water falling from the trees which accumulated from the misty air. Instantly I was in a bad mood for I'd lost three hours of my day. Daleville was slipping from a five to six day hike.
Can't rollback the clock so I started moving quickly through my morning routine. Within the hour I was hiking and the trail was wet but fairly good for hiking. There was no standing water on the trail. About the time I moved past my disappointment, the terrain became extremely tough, more rocks. It soon became apparent they'd be no big mileage day today, even if I'd been moving at 6 AM. It was only a touch over twelve miles. I had planned for a low mileage day on the 5th day into Daleville. Therefore, I alleviated my disappointment by saying I'd simply exchange today's mileage with day five.
I ended my hiking at 4 PM. The next shelter was too far away, rain still threatened, and this shelter was prime for the taking. I was the first to claim a spot. Mr. Zip, a retired postal worker from Pennsylvania, was the second to claim a spot. I'd seen him occasionally the past two weeks put did not know his trail name. We were all set to have the shelter to ourselves when three young hikers rolled in after 8 PM and secured the middle area while we were on opposite exterior walls.

As mentioned before, I seldom research the next day's hike. I'd rather the adventure reveal itself with every step I take. Sometimes you get an easy hike and sometimes you get a monster. Today it would be a monster.
I didn't even know what Dragons Tooth was but I imagined a few scenarios as the hike progressed. The Dragons Tooth ended up being a large cone shaped rock resembling a tooth. Perhaps the descriptor of dragon was there in reference to the climb to the tooth. Meaning, you were climbing from the start of the tail and up the back over sawtooth shaped terrain. And that was precisely the case as I climbed uphill 1000 feet over a distance of four miles which took a few hours. The climb was hard and treacherous from start to finish. But in this battle it was I, Jawz, that prevailed and the dragon was slain. Even with the accomplishment there was some defeat. My energy had been spent and hopes of a 20 mile day vanished. Maybe Daleville would have to wait until Friday.
The downward climb from Dragons Tooth was shorter but even more treacherous. One hiker later told me the descent was actually too dangerous for a person with weight on their back and hikers doing the entire trail should be given a safer route. I had to agree, yet somehow we got it done, just like all those before us. There was no time for pictures either. Thunder could be heard and there was a light rain. It took almost an hour to get completely down off the mountain and that was just to a parking lot used for locals.
With my energy spent I recalled an option I originally thought of but had not intended to utilize. It was a backup plan for bad weather. There was a donation based hostel one-half mile from the trail. It was time for plan B, stay at the hostel but have only a 17 mile day. I walked the distance on a paved road and found a bunk in a three bay garage. Being donation based, you get what you pay for. No towels, old soaps and a dirty bunk to name a few. The upside was it was a place to rest and there were some familiar faces. One hiker bought enough hot dogs for everyone and fired up the grill. There were several bags of chips available and strawberry shortcake for dessert too.
Lost & Found and I teamed up to beat the owner and another hiker at a game of corn hole. I recommended we retire undefeated and I prepared for bed.

In order to meet my goal of reaching Daleville by the end of the day I'd need loads of energy and some luck. Energy from food and from my surroundings. To get things started a good breakfast was a must. For that I had a cheese danish, snickers bar, glazed donut and two cups of coffee. This would put most of you into a sugar coma. But for a hiker this would provide energy similar to a bottle rocket, fast but short lived. I moved quick the first six miles reaching the parking lot to McAfee's Knob very quickly. Along the way I met a hiker going southbound and he was wearing an Army t-shirt. We spoke for only a few minutes. His name was Tortoise and he cheerfully reminded me that today was the Army's 243rd birthday. Happy Birthday Army!
I crossed the parking lot and clearly seen the posted sign on the trailhead indicating all dogs need to be on a leash. Normally not worth mentioning but you will soon see otherwise. In my rush to move like the wind I missed a turn on the trail. Not only until I hiked a half mile did I realize my mistake. I'd been following a fire service road. I doubled back as fast as I could. Now on the right trail, I met a young man interested in following me to McAfee's Knob. Over the next hour I learned much about him. His name is Lidin and he's originally from Texas but now lives in Virginia Beach. We talked about many things. He loves to follow soccer and travels every chance he can. For being only 24 he's got a solid head on his shoulders. I was impressed with his values and approach to life. He and his father are planning to attend a soccer game in Georgia in July. May your outting me memorable.
While Lidin and I were climbing we came across Swedee Pie. But something wasn't right. He was heading toward us and had tears in his eyes. I thought to myself, wow...must be some magical views ahead. I had misread the tears. They were of sadness, or more appropriately, anger. Swedee Pie was bitten behind the knee by an unleashed dog while trying to refill his water from a stream. Instantly I was angered. As hikers we know the risks we must take to complete our journey. Being bit by a dog due to the owner's negligence should not be one of them. I tried to console Swedee Pie as he headed back to the parking lot in hopes of getting a ride to a doctor. I wish I could say it calmed him down, but I can't. Let's hope for the best and wish him a return to the trail. And shame on the hiker who allowed this to happen by not following park policy. Karma will find you.
Upon reaching McAfee's Knob it lived up to the hype (see photos section). The views were magical and to experience them at the edge of the knob enhanced the experience. While Lidin and I awaited our turn to take photos, I spoke briefly with a father and daughter taking in the experience. They offered me chips and pretzels, I politely declined and told them I had a pocket full of snacks I was about to eat. It wasn't until the following morning I read that this gentleman signed my journal. Yes Rick, I remember you two clear as day and I did make Daleville and read your entry from the comfort of my hotel room. I wish you and your daughter the best and may you two have some wonderful adventures together. Thanks for being part of mine.
Thirty minutes had passed and it was time to get moving so I bid farewell to Lidin. Best wishes my friend. I still had plenty of miles to go. Within an hour I caught up to Sky Diver. Ironically, the hiker I had the conversation with about the dangers of unleashed dogs. He already knew what happened. Although not witnessing the bite, he was at the shelter where it occurred. We hiked together for an hour or so and arrived at Tinker Cliffs in tandem. We took a short break to enjoy the views. I told him my plans and offered the second bed in my hotel room should he make it to town. Then I moved out in front of him and pushed as best I could.
At about 5:00 I was low on water and there wasn't another source until just before Daleville. I decided I'd drink one-fourth of my remaining water every 30 minutes. I took my last drink about 6:40 and hit town at 7:01. Lucky for me the hotel was 50 yards away. I secured a room, showered and headed to Kroger for food. Sky Diver did make it to town just after 8:00 and took advantage of my offer.
In closing, please remember that we have the ability to affect all those we interact with. Let's work together, make those positive, and create a better world for us all.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595064,"I spent yesterday resting in the town of Daleville. The funny thing about hiking is the minimal sleep one needs. How the human body does so much every day still amazes me. Before I came on the adventure two hours of exercise wiped me out for that day and the next. Now I'm hiking eight or more hours a day and feeling great. Up early, I went to the free breakfast at the hotel then returned to the room to update my journal.
Afterward I walked to get a haircut. My hair, although short, had reached a length where bedhead was becoming apparent. It is bad enough I stink from not showering often. At least I can look good on the trail. I was a bit miffed by the cost of the haircut though. For a clipper cut that took about three minutes, $17. Then of course I had to add the tip.
In the same strip was the Three Lil Pigs BBQ joint. For lunch I had a combo of ribs, pork tenderloin, a baked potato and broccoli. The food was excellent and I had to order another half rack of ribs to get my fill. And I could have easily put down more. For dinner I had a large supreme thin crust from Pizza Hut. Once again, that went down easily. Hiker hunger is the real deal out here!
Today I was back on the trail and left before Sky Diver, the hiker I split the room with. It is always great to get back to hiking after a rest day. Today was very hot and humid with the forest canopy providing refuge from the direct sun. Occasionally I left the comforts of the forest and baked in the sun. My bandana was wet with sweat the entire day. I'd met Peaches and Bryce recently and they soon joined me at the shelter. Very rare, but I had cell service at the shelter which made it a 5-star shelter. It made the mice and bugs tolerable anyhow. I received a text from Barb B. in Florida saying a care package with my name on it was on its was to Harper's Ferry. I've been looking forward to this package since before I'd left. It means the adventure is about halfway complete. For book followers, mile 747.7 page 71.","VA 624, Newport Road

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595065,"It would be awhile until I found the next shelter with cell service but the adventure needed to continue and so I set out hoping for a shelter about 23 miles away. Peaches and Bryce had left before me. I was awake to eat breakfast and talk with them but they are more efficient with leaving camp.
I'd been hiking alone all morning then came across two hikers going south. They looked like locals since they weren't carrying large packs like all of us through hikers. A through hiker is one planning to hike the entire AT in less than a year, that's the definition. They informed me there was a rattlesnake on the side of the trail about two miles ahead. If I seen it, it'd be my first one. So far I've only heard of them from other hikers. I can't say if I was excited or scared. Haven't heard of anyone getting bit but there is always a first time. I trekked lightly until I figured I'd passed the area. Then all of a sudden there it was. A mere one to two feet off the trail and clear as day since it was black. My heart skipped a beat as I passed by. My momentum was too much to actually stop. Of course I stopped after passing to get some photos. The snake never flinched. I resisted the temptation to poke at it to see it move or shake its rattle, but it wasn't easy. I was very curious. But how would I explain it if by some chance it managed to bite me? I'd certainly look like a fool so I moved on.
Peaches and Bryce take a different approach to hiking. They take more breaks. When I caught up to them this time just before lunch, I found them in a small swimming hole in the river. Mr. Zip was there as well. I stayed only long enough to rinse my bandana in the cold river water, eat a protein bar and refill my water. I prefer to keep moving until the day's hike is complete.
Today was another hot and humid one. There were two large uphill climbs and no breeze to offset my energy output. That, and my stubbornness to keep breaks to a minimum, resulted in my gas tank running dry. I decided to stop a shelter early and call it a day at just a touch past 18 miles. That's still a great day of milage but my goal in Virginia is to average 20 miles per day when hiking. Mr. Zip also ran out of gas and decided to tent two miles before the shelter rather than finish the second climb. At the shelter I came across Compass and Fiji, two hikers I'd met at the hostel in Pearisburg and went to DQ with. It was a good place to stop and catch up on their adventures. They informed me Peaches and Bryce stopped then continued to the next shelter. For book followers, mile 766.1 page 74.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595067,"As I mentioned in a previous entry, you need to worry about getting through today before planning to far ahead. And yet again I got caught in the trap. I was hoping to hike more than 20 miles every day to get to the next town as soon as possible. I was planning on Waynesboro to be my next stop on the adventure. Instead it was the small town of Glasgow.
We've been having hot and humid weather for a few days in a row now and today was another one. The terrain wasn't too difficult and that allowed me to hike faster than usual. In the mid afternoon I came upon a two to three mile stretch of trail that was fairly straight with a slight incline. This allowed me to get into a rhythm and make good time. There was a problem though. It was all in the sun and the sun was beating down on me. Not long after leaving this favorable stretch I felt extremely warm. I was thinking it could be the start of heat exhaustion and needed a plan.
The plan was too cool off and as luck would have it the next shelter had a good flowing cold stream in front of it. I was disappointed that no one was at the shelter but it was only 3:30 PM. While I used the bandana to drizzle cold water over my head I decided to review the hiking guide. There was a hostel in the tiny town of Glasgow. I'd have to go 2.2 more miles and attempt to hitch into town since I had no cell signal to call for a ride. I've never hitchhiked but it was worth the try. At 4:00 I set out on a mission to give it a go. I figured the worst case was I couldn't get a hitch and I'd simply go 1.7 more miles to the next shelter.
The plan created a surge of energy inside. Others might say it was actually desperation. Either way, I trekked the 2.2 miles in only 27 minutes. It was easy trail alongside the James River. Now came the hard part, hitchhiking. I'll make this part short, I failed miserably! I don't have sexy legs and I'm not blonde, ha ha! Now plan B.
I had asked a guy if he had a cell signal, he did not. Thirty minutes later when he returned to his truck I approached and asked a favor. I gave him the number of the hostel and asked if he'd call and tell them a hiker was awaiting pickup when he drove into range of a cell tower. I told him he'd be doing me a favor and I played the Air Force Veteran card. It worked! He was an Air Force Veteran as well and in 30 minutes a car arrived looking for me.
Donna from the hostel said the hostel was full but the town had a free pavilion with a shower that I could stay at. I was disappointed but it was my only in-town option. She said the town's only restaurant was closed today. But, the local church provided free meals to hikers when the restaurant was closed. What luck! I was exiting the shower when the guy from the church arrived to get the hikers. The dinner provided was pizza, salad, watermelon, brownies, ice cream and raspberry lemonade. I hit the jackpot! I had 7 slices of pizza, 3 bowls of salad, and two slices of watermelon. I skipped the brownies and ice cream. There was even food left over after about 15 hikers feasted. Thanks to the Glasgow community for the treats.
Now the good part. Yes, this is the good part that tops the fantastic meal. I recognized a girl sitting across from me as Grasshopper. I hadn't seen her since the NOC on May 7th when she was battling excruciating pain. When I got her attention and said you're Grasshopper, right? She said, Oh my God, it is you Jawz! She suspected, but wasn't sure since I'd lost weight and grew the beard. Grasshopper has undergone tremendous adversity while at the same time overcoming it all. Right now she's wearing a boot while recovering from a stress fracture in her foot. She's working at the hostel rather than returning home and is hoping to be able to resume hiking in the near future. I'm one of several that convinced her to battle through and keep going. I'd thought of Grasshopper often but was afraid to text her. I didn't want to upset her if her dream of the AT was over due to the injury. I'm so happy to have been able to catch up with her and spend time chatting after the dinner. We should all wish Grasshopper a return to the trail. She's amazing regardless of what's in store for her. For me, another great adventure day on the trail. For book followers, mile 786.0 page 75.","Cornelius Creek Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595076,"With renewed energy from spending time with Grasshopper it was time to say goodbye to Glasgow and its hospitality. I had breakfast at the town's gas station, coffee and two packs of mini donuts. While I ate I conversed with a local who was breaking down 30-packs of Busch beer into 6-packs for resale. Outside of crossing over 800 adventure miles I wasn't sure what the day held for me.
At the 800 mile location I stopped to take a photo for Mr. Zip. I opted to leave my camera in my pack and forego the opportunity. Even though I hiked 20 miles today, the hiking portion provided little to write about. The two highlights were the view atop Bluff Mountain and my passing a turtle about two-thirds the way up the mountain. Yes, a real turtle right on the trail. As I wondered what in the world a real turtle was doing up here, I swear he tried to trip me. I understand his resentment with us faster moving climbers, but come on Mr. Turtle!
At the shelter I found two local hikers that were out for the night. They gave me a rice krispies treat. They setup tents in place of the shelter though.
I had lost my red bandana about an hour before and went back only a half mile to look for it. I wasn't going back farther than that. When Mr. Zip arrived he was carrying it. For that I was grateful. Its a necessity with these hot and humid Virginia days.
Later two more hikers arrived. They were new faces, one named Red for his red beard, the other Beagle for finding a lost dog. Red is a Marine Veteran from Chicago, the home town of my late father. He's hiking for a reason I wish wasn't the case. He and his brother planned to hike the trail together after their service to our great country. Tragically, his brother was KIA in Afghanistan. He's hiking in his honor and I can't imagine what he must be going through each day. My heart goes out to you and your family Red for your loss. I've yet to learn much about Beagle.

Mr. Zip was up and gone by 6:00 AM. Not sure why he was leaving so early and I never seen him the rest of the day. Red, Beagle and I talked while going through the morning routine. I was aiming to reach the Priest shelter, both of them the closer Seeley-Woodworth. After about 12 miles of hiking I found myself at the top of a ridge allowing me to see storm clouds looming a short distance away. Within minutes the wind picked up and this was my clue to stop and put on my pack's rain cover. I quickened my pace knowing a shelter was about 1.5 hours away. Didn't matter this time as the rain came almost instantly. I was soaked in a matter of minutes.
By the time I reached the shelter the rain had stopped but the damage was already done. No one was at the shelter. I changed into dry clothes and decided to rest while reviewing my options. In the end, having hiked 15.8 miles and having a sore right foot, this was my home until morning. I hung my clothes out to dry and did some journal writing. I also reviewed the hiking guide and determined I could do back-to-back 20 miles days to reach Waynesboro on Friday. I also hoped Red and Beagle stuck to their plan and arrived for company, they did. A few hikers stopped in to use the privy and get water then went on their way.
Red and I setup in the shelter while Beagle chose to tent. However, when a lightning storm came at 11:00 Beagle found his way into the shelter. After that passed it was a fairly quiet night. For book followers, mile 821.8 page 79.","Brown Mountain Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595082,"Anticipation of a trail town begins a day or two before arrival depending on how long you've been in the woods. I was starting to think of town food and the comforts of a hostel. I was hoping for a good day weather wise, more so today rather than tomorrow. A hiker can deal with rain much better when he knows the day ends in a hostel or hotel rather than drying out in a shelter or tenting. My hopes were soon squashed.
The day was going well early. Although having wet shoes from the day before I did start with fresh dry socks. Shoes tend to dry quickly on the trail once rain and water aren't present. I knew there was a large mountain to climb at the end of the day. The climb would be 3,000 feet over six miles. The saving grace was from that point it would be mostly downhill the following day to Waynesboro. There was a shelter half way up and I stopped here to eat and took advantage of the nearby stream to wash my legs. There was a nice pool about three feet deep. Just as I was leaving the shelter I thought I heard thunder and a hiker named StriKer told me earlier there was a good chance of rain this afternoon. Therefore, I turned around and dropped my pack on the elevated shelter floor and put on the pack's rain cover. Luckily I did. Well, luck in one way not another.
Now about two-thirds the way up the mountain, I came across a hiker named Tern. I'd met her just an hour before and she was now admiring an overlook. As I observed from the trail I could see the wall of rain coming. I said we're going to get soaked and we did. At first I tried to hide under trees but it was simply too much rain to play chicken. Shortly thereafter, and now soaked, I caught up with Roadrunner. She's a friend of Tern's that I also met earlier in the day. She let me pass and said she'd follow me. This was not ordinary trail. It was large rocks and changed directions quickly. The pace would be slow when dry. Now it was wet, slippery and even slower.
Oh how I despise rain on the trail. Roadrunner and I were now hiking up small rivers two to four inches deep. The only comfort, if there is such a thing in these conditions, is that once you're completely wet it doesn't matter any more. We also had the comfort of being in this mess together. You'd be surprised at how much having the ability to complain to another hiker during these times makes it OK. ""We in this $hit together man!""
Of course, when the hard part was over, the uphill, the rain stopped. We arrived at the shelter about an hour later and went through the process to get dry and claim our spot in the shelter. There we met Mission, a hiker that was lucky enough to be in the shelter before the rain. And guess what? I'd knocked out the first of two 20 mile back-to-back days. All I had to do was wake up in the morning and get to town, oh yeah! For book followers, mile 842.2 page 82.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595188,"Shelters have a mixed reputation on the trail. There are those that despise them since you will be exposed to mice and/or bugs. I've known hikers that have had mice get into their packs searching for food. Mice have even chewed holes in packs. Knock on wood, I've been lucky so far. We do our best to hang packs but the mice can be relentless. At least one shelter I stayed was known to house a black snake. Although unpleasant they are harmless to humans, or so I'm told. A snake would keep the mice in check though. Some hikers prefer their tents even when it rains.
I, on the other hand, will take a dry shelter over a wet tent at every opportunity. Packing a wet tent pushes the problem down the road. Eventually it will need to be dried out or mildew sets in. Mice are simply an overnight nuisance I'm willing to deal with. Basically, each hiker is unique in that he/she decides what conditions are acceptable and which are not to continue life on the trail.
When today began I knew I'd be sporting wet shoes and semi-dry socks and clothes. This is acceptable, at least bareable, knowing I was able to have a dry night of sleep and a dry tent in my pack. My third pair of socks that were completely dry would not be put on until I knew it wasn't going to rain again or I was more than half way to Waynesboro. The dry socks were brought out when I was five miles from town since rain no longer mattered. I could have brought them out sooner but didn't want to break until I had to. The need for a break arose to subdue hunger pains. I was out of snack foods having only one pasta side and two ramen noodles in my pack, both required cooking. I stopped at a shelter at 2:16 PM and made the ramen noodles while at the same time changing socks.
Remember also that today was the second half of the 20 mile back-to-back days to reach town. And now only five miles away I was informed of good news. Apparently there was a food stand close to where the trail met US 250. They sold popcorn, hotdogs and fries. My motivation and energy was in high gear now! A young hiker named Pebbles asked if he could hike with me to town. Of course I said. Little did he know this benefited me tremendously. My pace would be quick as we would surely talk the entire way. So off we went and made the five miles in only one hour and 40 minutes. This is a great pace for hiking with weight on your back.Arrival in trail town never gets old. It's a great feeling knowing your back to everyday luxuries even if just for a short while. I texted the hostel for a pick-up and was told 20 minutes.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595914,"I spent two days at the Stanimals Hostel in Waynesboro. Stanimal is the trail name of a guy that hiked the AT some years ago and now runs the hostel. It was a wonderful place to relax and the best hostel I've visited. Red and Beagle caught up to me here and we were fortunate to have time to enjoy an evening conversing over a couple beers. And I was able to have lunch with Roadrunner, Tern, Kiwi and StriKer at Ming's buffet. Roadrunner and her husband were gracious enough to treat (as a surprise) us hikers, thanks!
As I've mentioned previously, it always feels good to return to the trail. After all, hiking the trail is why I'm here. I began the day alone about 8:00 AM. Within a couple minutes of hiking I came across the self-registration station to fill out my permit. The permit was then attached to my backpack which can be seen in one of the photos. I had heard the Shanendoahs would be easier hiking compared to prior terrain. It proved to be true as I hiked the 20 miles in quick time and was at the hut by 4:20. Shelters are called huts in the Shanendoahs.
Shortly after arriving at the hut I heard the voice of a young girl say, ""There's a bear!"" It came from uphill and on the approach trail to the hut. I had passed the young girl and her father about three miles back and stopped to talk with them for about ten minutes. With my interest peaked, I grabbed my phone and slowly made my way to them. By the time they were in my sight the bear had moved off trail and down the hill toward the hut. Then we heard a lady at the hut say she could now see the bear so we hurried down to the hut. We were able to see two bears moving in the brush but were unable to get clear photos. I was amazed at the young girl's courage with the presence of bears. I think I was more nervous than she was.
After the excitement faded five of us gathered at the table for dinner. There was the father and daughter from Michigan, a mother and daughter and me. If we exchanged names, I apologize for not remembering them. The father shared his homemade jerky and I placed my almond M & M's in the center of the table for all to enjoy. I was happy to see the two families on adventure and having their company greatly enhanced my adventure. Eventually more hikers arrived and we had a full hut and many in tents.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595973,"With yesterday being the easiest day of hiking to date, I was hoping for a similar day. The first couple hours were fine. Then my energy vanished and each step became a chore. I'm unsure why since I had a good breakfast. The Shanendoahs have what are called waysides. A wayside is a place that has food and the first one was coming up soon. I decided to visit the wayside for coffee. It would mean doing an extra mile that doesn't count toward the adventure, but I needed a pick me up.
At the wayside I ordered the hiker special, three pancakes with choice of meat. I chose ham. I also drank two large cups of coffee. My visit lasted almost an hour. The father and daughter I'd met the day before came in and had lunch since the menu switched over from breakfast at 11:00 AM. I talked with them briefly and told them about my online journal. As I headed back to the main trail I passed Beagle coming down to the wayside. He was eager to get lunch.
The rest of the hiking day wasn't special. I had more energy now and just grinded out the miles. When I finally arrived at the hut there were five hikers there. None of whom I'd met before. Three were going southbound. Most of the day it threatened rain and I was happy to secure a spot in the hut. As time passed more hikers arrived and the hut became full. A few more came late and had no choice but to tent. It rained overnight and I was grateful to have my overnight home in the hut.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595975,"The overnight rain subsided before I left the hut to begin hiking. I was very pleased to not be hiking in the rain. However, there was a good chance of more rain today. After a couple hours of hiking I came to a picnic area and took a break here. I ate a protein bar and some trail mix. While here it sprinkled momentarily so I put on my pack's rain cover before returning to the trail. Rain came in the 11:00 hour but it wasn't heavy enough nor did it last long enough to adversely affect me. 
After a couple more hours of hiking I arrived at a campground in the park. Here there was a small store with cold sandwiches and other ready to eat items. I had a turkey and cheese sandwich, pretzels and a Gatorade. There were other hikers here too having lunch, all familiar faces. While eating I decided to call the lodge and see if a room was available. Fortunately there was but it was a bit pricey. I opted to spend the money and treat myself. The main factor was hearing that a storm was in the forecast for late evening. I wanted no part of that.
Today I also met a former hiker with trail name Joe Camo. He was doing trail magic and gave me a bag of chips. I declined the soda since I haven't drank soda since 1995. Unknown at the time, but Joe would play another part in my adventure in the days to come.
Today I had two bear encounters. I saw a small bear about 15 minutes after leaving the campground. The bear kept a safe distance. A few hours later the weather turned very foggy and I came across a larger bear walking on the trail and toward me. I was a bit concerned when it kept walking toward me. I made some noise with my trekking poles and it wandered off the trail. I resumed hiking and I passed the area where the bear left the trail but there was no sign of the bear. I was fine with that.
When I arrived at the side trail to the lodge the weather was nice and I seen an overlook about 100 feet further on the main trail. I decided to rest here and enjoy the view before making my way to the lodge. It was a great view with a nice breeze coming directly at me. I took a video and posted it to Facebook. After about 30 minutes I went and checked into the lodge. I was given half of a small cabin. It was small but nice with one bed and a full bath. I ate dinner at the main lodge which included chips and salsa, a salad and a small pizza. How those two beers found there way to me I'm not sure, ha ha!

I had the luxury of the cabin overnight and was in no hurry to leave in the morning. The couple extra hours of sleep I enjoyed were well deserved and I'm sure my body was also thankful. After a coffee from the lodge's gift and snack shop I returned to the trail at 9:30 AM.
My sights were set on reaching the Skyline Lounge around lunch time. Hikers are always willing to take advantage of every opportunity for good food. Especially when it can be reached from the trail. With my late start I was not planning to see any familiar faces at the lounge. I figured most hikers would have had their lunch and moved on. Upon arrival I found three hikers I know relaxing in the lobby. They'd already eaten and showed no signs of eagerness to return to hiking. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries and an iced tea. The burger was excellent!
I resumed hiking leaving the other three to the comforts of the lobby. Another hiker was arriving as I departed and I jokingly said the kitchen was closed, she was not happy. But I quickly assured her I was joking and the food was excellent.
Bears in the Shanendoahs have proven to be more common than anywhere else on this adventure. Stories of bear encounters started to become commonplace but to this point they've eluded my camera. I decided to leave my cell phone on in airplane mode in hopes of getting a photo or small video of a bear. This was a good decision. After completing a 30 minute incline I rounded a corner to find a bear in the trail about 75 yards ahead of me. I quickly started filming. The bear was on the video long enough for me to zoom in, then out, then begin walking toward it while filming. It left the trail to the right and I continued to film and walk down the trail. I fully anticipated passing through without seeing the bear again. That would not be the case. I arrived to find the bear in the bushes about six to ten feet off the trail. Although surprised, I continued to film and then zoomed in. It realized my presence and demonstrated behavior I'd say was consistent with not being happy. I stopped filming and quickly moved farther down the trail. The memory of this encounter will be with me forever.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596340,"The weekend was all lined-up for some wonderful rest and relaxation. All I had to do was hike my biggest day ever, 26.5 miles! The Shanendoahs are hiker-friendly terrain and I'd be hiking into a town. Remember, hiking into town usually ends with a downhill and this was no different. The last 10 miles went from 3,400 feet elevation down to about 1,000. Add in I'd be getting picked-up at the trailhead by my long time friend Mike U. and anticipation of town luxuries, it was certainly doable.
My hike began at 7:40 AM. I could have started sooner but Mike said he'd be getting into town late so there was originally no rush. About two hours into hiking I came across two small bears on the trail. Since I had a video the day before, I snapped a photo and then made noise to get them to clear the trail. Both headed uphill to the right and I only seen one as I walked through the area. They were small enough that momma bear could have been nearby but there was no indication she was.
I continued down the trail about 200 yards. At this point Sky Line Drive was uphill to my right about 50 to 75 yards. I heard a noise up the hill that was clearly loud enough to be a bear but I didn't see anything. As I continued to hike the noise moved uphill so I wasn't concerned. Then when the noise was directly to my right it got crazy. All of a sudden it sounded as though a boulder was coming down the hill at me. And I heard what was surely a bear's grunt. I started to run as my heart pounded and remembered that is not what you do when a black bear charges you. I stopped about 15 to 20 feet down the trail and turned around fully expecting the bear to appear on the trail. It did not. I really wanted to go back to see it. But if it was momma bear I'd be foolish to do so. And, by the behavior of this bear, it was either spooked by a vehicle on the road or not happy with my proximity to it. I wised-up and decided it was best to just move on down the trail.
Today I came across a hiker overhearing my conversation with another and he said he remembers me from the day I cracked my molar in half. I thought he looked familiar but since we have beards now I wasn't sure. I remember asking his group if anyone had a toothpick. He said I was one tenacious S.O.B. for coming back after my tooth issues. He's now known as trail name Ages.
A text arrived from Mike saying he was going to be early. Now I was getting really excited! With only six miles to go the terrain was flat and a wide path. I began jogging at every opportunity for the next three miles. I did that stretch quickly. The last three miles turned to a rocky downhill so I couldn't jog that portion. Mike hiked up the trail about a mile to meet me. When I seen him up a slight incline leaning on a fallen tree, it was all I could do to keep the tears back. I'd done over 900 miles since I'd seen any family or friends. Mike said he met a guy at the trailhead doing trail magic. By the description I knew it was Joe Camo, the former hiker I'd met at the campground a couple days earlier doing trail magic. Mike and Joe Camo had an interaction that left Mike suspicious. I assured Mike it was just the eagerness of the trail angels to help in every way they can.

Spending time with them was wonderful and it gave me the opportunity to share stories from my adventure. They brought some goodies from my sister Barb, thanks sis!
Eventually it was time for them to leave and we drove the hour to the trailhead were I'd resume my hike. It was the same spot Mike picked me up at. Again I had a few tears but the adventure needed to go on. The three days of rest and relaxation was needed. Thanks for the R & R Rose and Ron!
Today was the hottest and most humid day I've hiked. I only managed 10.5 miles after averaging nearly 19 per day while in Virginia. Having a loaded pack with all the goodies from family and friends didn't help either. About 30 minutes into the hike I saw my first copperhead snake. It was only about 18 inches in length and smack dab in the middle of the trail. It was clearly unmistakable as a copperhead and I made sure it was alive then stepped around it and went on my way. In another 30 minutes a came up to a hiker standing still in the trail. I thought she looked familiar and as she spoke I was certain who she was. It was Cajun Fire. I haven't seen her since just before entering the Smoky Mountains. You may recall, she was the one that had her tent destroyed by a bear while in the Smoky Mountains. Her and I stayed at the same shelter today and it was nice to catch-up on her adventures and her about the bear incident first hand.
It was unbelievable how much the heat and humidity cut into my miles. There was no option but to end early to ensure I didn't get heat exhaustion, or worse heat stroke. I was sweating out water faster than I could drink it. I moved slow and took lots of breaks. It will be short mileage days until this heat wave ends.

The heat and humidity continued. I was on the trail by 7:30 AM hoping to get some easier miles before mid-day. But it really didn't matter as the humidity was still the enemy. There was a shelter about 13 miles away and that became my initial goal. I figured once I was there I'd assess the possibility of going farther. When I arrived around 3:00 PM I found three hikers there. A father and son and a girl named Cheesy, all are section hikers. They informed me they would be staying put but were going to tent. I decided to stay and claimed a spot in the shelter. It was 6.9 miles to the next shelter and that was not feasible in the heat given how I felt. Stopping to tent in between is not something I wanted to do either as rain was possible.
In the end four other hikers arrived and all four tented. For the first time I would be the lone hiker sleeping in the shelter. I napped from about four to seven o'clock. I was in and out of sleep during this time.
At about 7:00 PM it started to rain lightly and thunder could be heard off in the distance. Getting late, I ate cold foods in the comfort of the shelter while the others ate at a picnic table under a separate roof. At one point one of them yelled to me that the hiker log book had an entry saying a copperhead snake was seen going in the hole in the right corner the day before. The only hole I could see was at the foundation's base, not on the shelter floor which was 2 feet up. It didn't really phase me as I figured with the rain it would stay where it was. And I'm a bit bigger than the shelter mice. I'm not going to lie, I did think about the possibility of it finding its way into my sleeping bag at night. I simply hoped that would not be the case. Lucky for me the snake didn't make an appearance. Well, at least not that I know of.
The temperature dropped slightly with the rain but I slept most of the night outside the sleeping bag atop my air mattress. It rained most of the night but not heavy. It was a very light rain that really had no affect on trail conditions the next day. For book followers, mile 994.4 page 95.","Manassas Gap Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596472,"Today makes the third day in a row the weather has been hot and humid. These conditions have cut my daily miles in about half. Although disappointing, I needed to understand the weather is a factor in hiking and needs to be dealt with accordingly. In talking with other hikers it is affecting all of us. It was good to know it wasn't just me at 50 years of age.
From where I was at, today's options for shelters were at distances of seven and 21 miles. The heat pretty much ruled out the one at 21 miles and I really didn't want to do only seven miles then hang around a shelter all afternoon. Odds are I'd be along most of that time. And we all know I prefer shelters over tenting. Then I remembered from the day before a hiker mentioning he was aiming for a hostel. I looked in the guide book and the Bears Den Hostel was ten miles away. Ten miles would be respectable in the heat and allow me to spend the rest of the day hanging at the hostel. And so I began hiking with the plan of getting to the hostel.
It wasn't long before my hiking clothes were drenched with sweat. I was like a human waterfall. The first six miles were uncomfortable but acceptable. The last four were down right miserable. I labored through each step. The hostel sat at the top of a half-mile climb and I swear I left a trail of sweat over that half-mile. At last I made it! The hostel had no air conditioning but sitting in front of a fan after a cold shower was good enough. The hiker special was $30. For that I received a bunk, shower, laundry, a tombstone pizza, pint of Ben & Jerry's and a Gatorade. It included coffee and pancakes in the morning but I only indulged in the coffee while eating peanut butter cookies from my sister Barb.
There were two notable events during today's hike. My adventure has surpassed 1,000 miles. I didn't see any indicator on the side of the trail, probably due to just wanting to get the day's hike over with. At the hostel I creatively made my own picture (play off of Dr. Evil) to celebrate the milestone. I also saw a bear today about an hour into the hike. Oddly enough, when I saw the bear he'd run up the hill and I'd eventually hike upward and see him again. This occurred four or five times. I then came across Cheesy and she appeared a bit shaken by the bear coming up the hill from behind her. She left the shelter about 30 minutes before me. We hiked together and chatted about 45 minutes before I pulled away. She's from Virginia and was only hiking for a week and I wanted to make sure she was beyond the bear encounter.
I have a suspicion that bear was aiming for the Bears Den Hostel to also avoid the heat. Luckily I beat him there and locked all the doors, ha ha! For book followers, mile 1,004.3 page 96.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596598,"Officially hiking into Harpers Ferry was very emotional. Hikers have this town on there mind right from the start down in Georgia. And when I began crossing the road bridge over the Shanendoah River, that is when the emotions started. I'll be honest, I was not 100% sure I'd make this destination when I began the adventure back on April 6th. I'd never hiked like this before and wasn't sure what to expect. Fortunately, I've overcome some minor setbacks (dental issues) and been lucky enough to avoid injury and illness. Others have not been as fortunate.
When Barb B. from Florida told me she wanted to send a care package, and she said this many months before I started, I purposely gave her the address to the ATC knowing it would be special in many ways. There were many days of hiking were I'd say to myself, you have to keep going and get to that package. And after hiking over 1,000 miles I got to the ATC and picked-up her care package! Thanks so much Barb for being part of this momentous achievement. I hope you and everyone else are enjoying following the adventure. Without all of you supporting and following me this would not be possible, thanks.
The weather today was overcast with light rain until about 2:30 PM. The temperature was cooler with acceptable humidity. This allowed me to get back to good mileage and hike 20 miles today, leaving Virginia and crossing into West Virginia. I also took the advice of Mike U. and froze a bottle of water. After the first three climbs today I used the bottle to cool down by placing it against my neck, head and wrists. Once the ice was completely melted, I added some electrolyte mix and enjoyed an ice cold drink. Thanks for the tip Mike. It felt great today to be back to hiking like I had become accustomed to. I averaged 19 miles per hiking day in Virginia. Virginia was over 500 miles of hiking and the state has now been crossed off the list.
At about the halfway point of today's hike I texted a couple Air Force friends to see if they could come to Harpers Ferry tomorrow. I served with them at Fairchild AFB and they both now lived within an hour of Harpers Ferry. I was happy to find out later in the day when I checked my phone while on the highway bridge that they'd love to get together tomorrow.
I stayed at the Teahorse Hostel and discovered hiker Lost & Found was staying here as well. It has been a few weeks since we've crossed paths.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596993,"Today's hike began with my saying goodbye to Harpers Ferry and quickly crossing the Potomac River and entering Maryland. For some unknown reason my feet ached more than usual and this was coming off two days of rest. I was hoping for a 20 mile day and ducked into a shelter at 16 miles and called it a day. The only noteworthy thing to mention while hiking was seeing a small copperhead snake right on the trail, the second one I've seen on the adventure.
This journal entry is about a special day on this adventure. I was able to reunite with two great friends from my Air Force days dating back to 1988-91. I hadn't seen Duane (from Alaska) since 2001 and Ryan (from Montana) since 1995 when I attended his wedding. Attending the wedding was by chance as I was in Virginia to visit a now former brother-in-law and called upon Duane who also lived in Virginia. He said Ryan was getting married in Maryland and with a bit of luck I was able to attend both the wedding and reception. Ryan has now been married 23 years, amazing! This is how the day went.
Duane called me Saturday morning to arrange for picking me up at the hostel. I was waiting on the sidewalk when he arrived in a convertible BMW. I'm not sure the last time I was in a convertible. And so we were rolling down the road to a nearby town where we'd meet Ryan. In riding with Duane, it was just like the old days when we'd leave the base for town. Except now we were in a BMW rather than a Subaru mini-wagon. That was Duane's ride of choice years ago, ha ha! We arrived at the Blue Moon Cafe and waited for Ryan.
When Ryan arrived and walked past the window I recognized his side profile immediately, even after all these years. The two of them live fairly close to each other but have only seen each other once or twice since 1995. I guess it took me hiking the AT to get them together. We spent five hours at the cafe, had lunch and some beers. Putting it into words wouldn't do it justice. But believe me, it was a very special day for us. Ryan even had a medallion on his keychain that Duane gave him while they served together in Korea. This was after we parted ways from Fairchild AFB, perhaps 1994 or so. Ryan is still carrying the medallion around. And we all work in the IT (information technology) field now. Duane for the federal government and Ryan a fortune 500 company that deals in data centers.
There was an older couple sitting next to us for awhile at the cafe. The lady and I made eye contact a couple times and she smiled. As they left the two stopped to chat with us. I guess they could hear us talking about our Air Force days. I think half the place heard us. We were having a great time. Turns out he was a Korean War veteran just like my late father. I'm sure listening to us brought back memories of his service to our great country. I'm glad he stopped to chat with the three of us.
Eventually the day had to end. Ryan had just come back from Hawaii the day before and had yet to unpack. And Duane was going to drive me to Wal-Mart for a resupply. The two of them talked of getting together soon, I sure hope they do. And I promised to make another visit in the future by doing so before too many years go by. There was talk that another person we served with lived near by also. We will try to hunt down Frank Wells for the next visit.
After Duane and I went to Wal-Mart he dropped me off at the hostel. And so came a close to one of the best days this adventure will ever see.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597253,"What a difference a day can make. I took one ibuprofen before setting out to hike and the foot pains from the day before did not return. This allowed me to hike 20 miles which I've become accustomed to doing regularly. The hike today took me through some historic areas associated with George Washington. I spent some time talking to a local historian, but we talked more about hiking rather than our first President.
At the Teahorse Hostel I bumped into Erich, the hiker from Switzerland. He now goes by the trail name 'CH' since his first name ends in those two letters. The last time I seen CH was at the Hiker Inn in Damascus, Virginia. With my taking time off to visit with family and friends he was able to catch up with me. We took the opportunity to discuss our hikes at dinner and I'm happy to report he's doing well. Looks like he'll be able to complete his hike before his deadline to head back to Switzerland. There was a stretch where we hiked together today and he's much faster now compared to when I first met him in the rain some time ago. A couple times I fell behind while keeping him in site.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597260,"I'm now taking one ibuprofen each day about three hours after starting to hike. Three hours of hiking was when my feet would start to ache. Hoping this strategy works.
Today I crossed a significant line and almost crossed another. First, the significant line. After hiking a couple hours I crossed the Mason-Dixon line, leaving Maryland behind me and entering Pennsylvania. It feels good to cross another state off the list and now be in the north verses the south. This means I'm moving along in the adventure that ends in Maine. Although now in Pennsylvania, I'm actually moving farther away from Ohio. Sorry sister Barb!
When I arrived at the shelter today I was the only hiker there. For some reason, Pennsylvania prefers to have two smaller shelters side-by-side rather than one larger shelter. At first I though this was a waste of space. But it does make sense if there are two groups of hikers and each wants to feel as if they have some privacy.
Eventually another hiker arrived. One I've not seen before. She is from Pennsylvania and hiking this state only. Today was her first day. I never did get her name but we talked over dinner and she was kind enough to give me a handful of fresh cherries she carried in with her. She decided to tent and in the end I was the only one in my shelter and a couple hikers came later to occupy the other.
Now to the second line I almost crossed. About 45 minutes after hiking up to Chimney Rocks and taking in the view, I was cruising along an easy stretch of trail when I froze in my tracks. I didn't see it initially but I certainly did hear it. I'd never heard a rattlesnake in the wild until this moment. The rattle came from right in front of me and from the ground. So I pretty much knew what it was. It was a six foot timber rattlesnake and only the last foot or so was on the trail. He shook his rattle to let me know he was there and I'm thankful for that. I watched for about a minute as it slowly slithered off the trail. Sorry to say my phone was buried in my pack and I decided it was best to just keep moving.

There is a tradition on the AT to eat a half gallon of ice cream to celebrate the half way accomplishment. I'd originnally planned on tackling the challenge. However, I decided to forgo the challenge and opted for real food. Besides, the ice cream wasn't special. It was stuff I could by in my hometown. Having hiked over 22 miles and skipping a snack, I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. The fries were thin cut like those at carnivals. Perfect! I ate around 6:30 PM and also ordered a buffalo chicken wrap for a snack before bed. Let me tell you, this was the best buffalo chicken wrap I've ever had. They grilled it which I think was what put it over the top.
I spent the night at the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel. The building is a historic mansion and is now used by the ATC for a hostel. I paid to be included in the breakfast which was bagel, waffles, OJ, Mixed fruit and coffee. I skipped the scrambled eggs.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597433,"I'm in the middle of a nice stretch for hikers on the AT. With good planning there is town food readily available for three days in a row. Today I had my sights set on reaching Boiling Springs for dinner.
Prior to that I left the trail around lunch time and walked a half mile to a small deli. I ordered the club sub with loads of fixings and also bought two single serving bags of pickle chips. Add in a cold drink and it was an awesome lunch.
Today the trail went through plenty of farmland. At times I felt like I was back in Ohio in the farming areas. There were corn and soybean fields. The corn here is about seven feet tall in some areas. The trouble with hiking in these areas is the lack of shade. Being out in the sun too long means taking extra precautions. You either cover up or use sunscreen. Trouble with sunscreen is you are adding it to dirty, sweaty skin. Not to mention bug screen too. All this can't be good for your skin since we seldom shower daily.
Once I arrived in Boiling Springs I ate at a cafe and had chicken fajitas and a small garden salad. There weren't any places to stay in town so I opted to tent. This was the first time I tented in almost a month. The campsite was near railroad tracks. Trains came through twice an hour all through the night. Without the protection of house walls I heard the squeak of every wheel. A small price to pay for great town food.
Before heading out the following morning I talked to a few locals at the gas station. The spring that is in Boiling Springs runs year round at a constant temperature. And the main source of the water is Lake Erie. For book followers, mile 1,122.3 page 112.","Pine Grove Furnace SP

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597606,"I had received a message from hiker Cajun Fire that the first 12 miles out of Boiling Springs were mostly along the edges of farmland. This meant there would be little cover from the forest's canopy. Therefore, I set out early to hike these miles before the sun would be directly overhead. I made quick work of those miles and was back into tree cover by noon. There were small stretches of trail out in the open throughout the remainder of the day, but sunscreen and draping my handkerchief under my hat did the trick.
This was the first time natural food was available alongside the trail. A few times I was able to pick some wild raspberries. The flavor of the fresh berries were a welcome change to drinking warm water. I even found a small patch of blackberries but the ripe ones were already picked by hikers ahead of me. When I reached Duncannon I came across the motherload of red raspberries and took some time to pick a large handful. More were available but I wasn't willing to venture too far into the weeds for fear of poison ivy and snakes.
Earlier as I approached Duncannon, I came across a nice overlook of the valley and city below (see photo). From that spot there was a very steep downhill into down. In town I stayed at the Hotel Doyal. Although a bit run down it did fine for a hiker coming out of the woods. At the hotel bar I met Vicki and Patrick. They were running the hotel and have been together for 39 years. The food was great. I had a cheeseburger, fries, six wings and a fresh salad. Beagle and Boogerbear came in for a beer and sat beside me. We had a great time talking with Vicki. When we left, she came out from behind the bar and gave us all hugs.
Then we walked a couple of blocks to get ice cream. I had a large waffle cone with chocolate peanut butter ice cream, yum! We then went to a small sports bar for one more drink and called it a night.

But, I wasn't in any hurry to leave either. So I decided to wait out the threat of rain and have a short day of hiking to a shelter only 11 miles away. This would serve as a small rest. I used my morning time to have breakfast and do laundry. I then went back to the Hotel Doyal and sat on the covered second floor balcony to use their WiFi.
While I was catching up on my journal, I received a text from Lost & Found asking where I was at. I'd last seen him in Harpers Ferry over a week ago. He left the day before me. Somehow I was able to get ahead of him on the trail. Right after sending a reply I heard a voice from the street below. He's walking on the sidewalk having just arrived in Duncannon. He was interested in a beer and watching the World Cup Soccer final.
I spoke with him briefly and then he wandered off. About 30 minutes later I went looking for him and found him at the pizza place. There was about eight hikers there eating food and watching the game. I'm not necessarily a big fan of soccer but it was something to do while waiting for the rain to subside. And of course there was pizza and lunch time was just about here. I packed up and headed over to the pizza place. I came into the game just before the end of the first half and watched the remainder of the game, France won. Lost & Found and I split a large sausage-pepperoni pizza. And by large I mean larger than most pizza joints' larges.
By the time the game was over I could see the sun was now shining. I'd beat the system by waiting out the rain. Or so I thought. Mind you, it was only a drizzle I was waiting out. In the end, waiting was a mistake. For now the humidity was in full force. Earlier there was none and I'd surely prefer to hike in light rain rather than high humidity. I hit the trail early afternoon and realized there was no perfect time to leave as my plan backfired and my freshly washed clothes were now drenched in sweat.

There has been the chance of rain in the forecast for three days. To this point I've been lucky enough to not see more than a brief drizzle. That was about to change.
To begin though, lets start with early morning where I came across a first on the trail. I heard rumors there was a flooded stretch of trail caused by a beaver's dam. Sure enough, a mile into the day's hike I arrived at a flooded area. There was water on both sides of the trail that extended far enough into the woods to rule out walking around the hazard. The good thing was that the water wasn't as deep as the rumors specified which was waist high. It was anywhere from three to eight inches deep and the bottom was another couple inches of soft mud and silt. I could see the other side and decided to remove my hiking shoes and used my rubber camp shoes to cross the hazard. All went well but I did get a shoe stuck in the silt a few times. There was no sign of the beaver.
Around noon a hiker passed by while I was taking a break. He was just dropped off at the road I recently crossed. He said rain was coming soon. Within 20 minutes I had to stop to put on my pack's rain cover. It drizzled for about 30 minutes before starting to rain. It took me two hours to reach the nearest shelter. By then I was soaked. I arrived to find one hiker in his sleeping bag. I quickly got out of my wet clothes and into nice dry clothes. It was now about 2:30 in the afternoon. There was cell service and I used some time to enter a couple online journal entries then climbed into my sleeping bag to combat a chill. The rain stopped around 4:30 and the sun reappeared. Hikers that arrived after me, and the one that was there, opted to hike further down the trail to the next shelter 4.5 miles away. That shelter was fully enclosed, located right on PA 501, and a pizza place delivered to the shelter. I did an assessment and decided to stay here for the night. Pizza wasn't enough motivation to put wet clothes back on. However, my decision to stay meant I'd need a big day of mileage to reach Port Clinton tomorrow.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598083,"Yesterday was a short mileage day due to the rain. After I dried out in the shelter, the rain had stopped but I surely didn't want to get back into wet clothes and resume hiking about 4.5 miles to the next shelter. Other hikers opted to hike onward. Call me a sissy if you'd like. Its my adventure and I call the shots out here. By opting to stay warm and cozy in a shelter with a cell signal the previous day, I left myself with a big day of hiking if I wanted to reach Port Clinton. I started hiking about 7:15 AM.
I was short on snacks and didn't bother eating breakfast. I made cold prep oatmeal to eat about two hours down the trail. Cold prep is preparing food without cooking it. We hikers do this all the time. Oatmeal and ramen are good choices for this technique. The trail has a way of providing what you need out here. You can call it luck or from heaven above. Well, about one hour into my hike I came across a road guard with snacks placed on it. I took a bag of sun chips and a pack of crackers. They became my breakfast. When I ate the oatmeal two hours later, I cold prepped ramen noodles for my next snack. I basically ate something every two hours just to keep the hunger at bay. I didn't want to take extra time to cook a rice side or similar. I just needed to hike as much as I could to reach Port Clinton by the end of the day.
During the late morning I came to a section of trail that was flooded. Only the trail was flooded, not the surrounding areas. I began hiking with my shoes on since the water wasn't too deep. I played frogger going from rock to rock thinking this would be a short inconvenience. I was wrong. It lasted nearly a mile and my right foot slipped off a log and I got a soaker. My shoes had just started to feel dry from yesterday's rain too! This stretch slowed me down as well but I survived and kept pushing to town.
After 19 miles I snuck into a shelter for a break to eat a second ramen noodles and cold mashed potatoes, and to put on dry socks. This would be my last break before making the final approach to town. My break was about 45 minutes and when I returned to the trail Boogerbear was hiking by. He was going to town also but was hiking a shorter distance having started the day closer to town than I. We hiked the final nine miles together while taking turns as to who was the lead hiker. He's from Austin, Texas, and our conversation helped pass the time. When we reached town at 8:15 PM, I'd spent nearly 13 hours on the trail and achieved my personal best of 28.2 miles hiked. I was very proud of myself for this accomplishment. The excitement offset how tired I was.
We went to a tenting pavilion setup for hikers and went through the routine of setting up our areas. With that taken care of we couldn't let a night in town go to waste. We heard there was a good chance we could get into the private club a half mile from the pavilion so we went for it. We buzzed and the door unlocked. We walked in and I said, ""Who wants to sponsor (sign in) two thirsty hikers? We'll buy you a drink."" I then turned to the ATM to make a withdrawal and before I was done Boogerbear brought me the guest book to sign my real name. We were in! I had five beers and five bags of jalapeno potato chips. The locals were as friendly as can be and they bought us a couple rounds. We left good tips for the bar tender to show our appreciation. Whenever a hiker is in need, the trail will provide.

At the tenting pavilion was a trail angel named 'Can Do Will Do'. He's a former through-hiker from Florida and drove up to Pennsylvania to do a week of trail magic. He spent his time shuttling hikers around to ensure they were able to get everything they needed before heading back to the trail. He did this out of kindness, asking for nothing in exchange. He tented in the pavilion with the hikers.
Can Do Will Do dropped me off at the laundromat and told me to give him a call when I needed a pickup. I updated my online journal while doing laundry and stuck around to use the power outlet when my laundry was finished. Eventually Boogerbear arrived and did his laundry. When he finished it was lunch time so we went to the nearby 1787 Brewing Company for lunch. They just opened in June. It was a great choice. Afterward Boogerbear headed to his hotel and I began walking to Wal-Mart for a resupply. Wal-Mart was almost two miles away.
I was halfway there when Can Do Will Do spotted me, honked, and pulled over on the opposite side of the road. When I got in his truck he said loudly, ""What the heck are you doing?"" He was upset that I was walking instead of calling him to shuttle me to Wal-Mart. He was on his way to Wal-Mart now to pickup more hikers. When we left Wal-Mart to go back to the tenting pavilion there were seven hikers in his truck. The two in the truck's bed had to keep their heads down. I guess its a no-no to ride in the back of trucks around here.
When night time rolled around I spent two hours talking with Can Do Will Do. He retired from the Air Force as a Senior Master Sergeant (an E-8, E-9 is highest enlisted grade). We had a blast sharing our Air Force stories. He obviously had more to share having served 20+ years. It was nice to use all the Air Force lingo and have each other fully understand it. Can Do Will Do headed home the following day and I headed back to the trail. And although I only tented in town rather than a hostel or hotel, my stay in Port Clinton was wonderful. I've encountered many people like Can Do Will Do on my adventure and trail angels like him make things a bit easier and certainly more fun.
It was good to see familiar faces in Port Clinton. I bumped into Tern, Kiwi and StriKer once again. My hike out of Port Clinton was to a shelter 22 miles away. I stopped to enjoy an overlook at Pulpit Rock, taking pictures and a small video. Beagle joined me at the shelter and Red Bard chose to tent.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598132,"Today's hike was setup to be a bit shorter than what I prefer. That is because there was a shelter about 17 miles away and the one after that was nearly 17 as well. With a good chance of rain in the forecast, tenting between the shelters was undesirable.
Rain was in the forecast to begin at 2:00 PM. When I left for the day my calculated arrival time was about that time. That left little time for error in the event I took extended breaks or dilly-dallied around while hiking. There's always an x-factor in hiking. Today it was two large rock fields that I had to navigate. Both required me to be very careful and move slowly. One slip and fall could have ended my adventure. I'm not exaggerating either. The rocks came up to form a ridge and you hiked along the top. A fall would be of at least six feet onto other rocks. Falling with a pack on your back would certainly prevent a controlled fall too. It was similar to walking a break wall on Lake Erie.
When I arrived at an in between shelter to take a break it was just after noon time. Here I picked some wild blackberries and added them to my water. When I began hiking again it was time to motor to beat the coming rain. I moved as quickly as I could the next couple hours and hit my destination shelter about 2:25 PM. It was drizzling now but not enough to matter. I was in the shelter before the storm.
And storm it did! Rain came medium-heavy by 6:00 PM. And shortly afterwards the high winds started. There was a dead tree right behind the shelter and all night branches smashed down on the roof. Many times one of us hikers would let out an obscene yell when a really big one hit. In the morning the wind was gone and the area around the shelter was littered with new firewood. The hikers that would soon follow us wouldn't have to work for their firewood.There were seven of us in the shelter but the last three arrived late and were soaking wet. At least they were settled in before the high winds started. I know they were elated there was room in the shelter and didn't have to tent.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598213,"What a difference a day can make on your attitude. Yesterday my approach was to get to the destination shelter by the time the rains came. There was rain in today's forecast but I really didn't care about it. Today was simply about getting to the next destination shelter to prepare for hiking into the town of Delaware Water Gap the following day.
I was the last to leave the shelter and didn't anticipate catching up to anyone that left before me. At this point in my adventure a distance of around 17 miles is not a long day. I could afford to have a slower paced day. The hike started with a steep downhill to a major road. In this article's photo you can see the road. The shelter I left was in the trees in the upper right portion of the photo. When I was crossing the bridge in the photo I had a clear view to the mountain the photo was taken from. In my mind, the side of the mountain was too rocky for the trail to go that direction. Well, I was mistaken. This was a very challenging climb. Once at the top I took the opportunity to take photos and a small video. I came to find out there was actually a bit more to climb once I started moving again. Once the climb was over I had a great feeling of reward for the accomplishment. I imagined the cars traveling below could see my red pack against the mountainside and be thinking to themselves I was simply nuts to be up there.
There was then a small stretch of narrow trail with little to no change in elevation with lots of growth on either side. Not much excitement here. Once this stretch was over the trail turned to a nice, easy, straight and wide section for a few miles. This portion was loaded with wild red raspberries along the trail within an arm's reach. I was stopping every few hundred yards to pick a small handful. The main reason was water was scare in this section and the berries would add some water to my daily intake.
Rain eventually arrived toward the end of my hike and did what it does, soaked me. It stopped when I was about half an hour from the shelter. I realized that had I left the previous shelter at the time I normally do that I could have avoided rain today. I didn't think I'd be lucky enough to do so two days in a row. Be as it may, I changed into dry clothes and settled in to eat and rest. The shelter filled at six hikers and three had to be turned away. I thought we could sqeeze them in but the other five seemed to not be interested. I felt bad because it was my friends Tern, Kiwi and StriKer. They ended up tenting just up the trail in a campsite. When it poured heavily about an hour later as I way laying in a warm dry place, I felt even worse that my friends were out in that rain. I seen them the following morning and apologized for their misfortune. Tern said it was fine as I tried but the others were the ones that seemed to not care. I was pleased her attitude was pleasant and she'd basically already put it behind her. On this adventure your attitude can be the difference between a good day and a bad one. Way to be positive Tern!

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598603,"There are 14 states that the AT goes through from Georgia to Maine. Pennsylvania marks the seventh state along the trail. Today my hike basically put PA behind me. I'm only .3 miles from entering New Jersey. That makes seven states complete and seven remaining to be hiked.
PA started off with welcome arms. The trail was pretty easy, flat and relatively straight. I made quick work of the first half of the total miles in the state. After the town of Duncannon the trail took a turn for the worse. Rocks, rocks, and more rocks! I've seen every rock imaginable in this state. Big, small, round, square, dull, sharp, and ones meeting every combination of these. These rocks took their toll on my feet. And I'm happy to be done with hiking the state of PA.
Putting the rocks aside, today's hike was pretty good. It rained in the early portion of the hike. I spent about an hour and a half hiking with Tern and that helped the time go by quickly. Eventually I had to quicken my pace to make Delaware Water Gap and wished Tern a good day. At 4:00 PM when I rolled into a shelter to take my final break I was completely dried out from the morning's rain. I opted to put on fresh socks for the final three hours to town. As I left the shelter the sun disappeared and it pour once again. So much for fresh socks. At one point after being totally resoaked I let out a big yell to Mother Nature to bring it on! I was in a good mood at this point as town became closer and closer. The rain soon stopped as she must of figured there was no way to dampen my spirits at this point.
I had planned to stay at a church-run hostel in town. But on arrival I spoke with Red Bard, he already assessed the place, and learned it was full and not up to par. Red Bard and I decided to split the cost of a room at the Pocono Inn. After cleaning up we met Beagle at the Sycamore Grill for dinner and of course, a cold beer.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598921,"Thanks to Johnny and Marcia Yonushatis for the wonderful care package sent to Delaware Water Gap, PA. The pickles were delish! Looking forward to visiting Portage this fall.
I took a day of rest before heading to New Jersey. Red Bard and I split the cost of a room at Pocono Inn. On the day we were to head out I awoke to find it raining. That was enough for me to take a second day off. Red Bard departed in the rain. I just hung around the hotel most of the day. I only left to go to Wal-Mart for a couple items and to the local pizza joint for dinner. I had one of my favorite dishes, chicken parmesan.
On the morning of my third day in Delaware Water Gap it had rained. Honestly, I wanted to take another day off but couldn't justify it. By the time I left the hotel the rain had stopped. And after I walked the .3 miles of road to get to New Jersey's trail, it was a new day of hiking and I felt great. The rain was over for the day.
New Jersey's trail was crowded. I passed a scout troop of about 50 or so kids. There was also a group of teenagers that setup camp at the base of an observation tower. Lastly I came across another group of teenagers and I stopped to chat with them. They looked beat! They were doing a nine mile hike. When I told them how far I've gone and how long I've been on the AT, they were in shock. I hope it made their nine mile day look much better from their point of view. When I arrived at the shelter I was surprised to only find one other hiker there. It was Rush. He and I battled the bugs all night long. It was a game of whack-a-mosquito. They were winning unfortunately. For book followers, mile 1,319.5 page 132.","Delaware Water Gap, PA

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598925,"After fighting off mosquitos all night I was ready to head back to hiking. I even skipped filling up on water because the night before this was the place mosquitos were the worst. Rush left before me and planned to stop at a bar about a half mile from the trail. He was hoping to get a bite to eat. At first I wasn't going to stop since it would be only 9:00 AM when I made that distance.
But there was an x-factor in play today. New Jersey's water sources are suspect at best. I've refilled my water from streams and found it clear in the stream but with a brown tint in my bottle. Thirsty or not, I'll pass. Stopping at the bar would allow for quenching my thirst. They'd have to have some non-alcoholic drinks. When I approached I found Rush and another hiker sitting across the street. They said the bar wasn't open yet even though it was past opening hour. There was a bait and tackle shop next door. Rush said they had cold drinks inside. Now normally when I go to a bait and tackle shop its for fishing-oriented purchases. Today was the exception. I bought a Gatorade and a Lipton green tea. I drank those while eating a protein bar and chatting with the hikers. When I left about 30 minutes later the bar was still not open. Rush continued to wait. I had miles to hike and couldn't afford to wait around.
Today's trail was mostly easy but compared to yesterday it was isolated. It was a day of just me doing my thing, getting in the miles. I took 40 minutes for lunch at a really nice pavilion and seen nobody during that time. I thought that was odd seeing as a parking lot wasn't that far away on a side trail. With lunch over and now back on the trail, I recalled Rush saying there was a good chance of late afternoon rain. Well, if he was right I didn't want to get caught in it so I moved with a purpose. When I started to hear far off thunder I picked up the pace. I went the next 90 minutes hoping to win the battle. And fortunately I did. Thirty minutes after I strolled into the shelter it poured but I was safe and dry. The rain stopped and returned a few times during the night. At one point it was really coming down and the shelter's roof showed signs of age with a few areas of drips. I stayed dry but it was another night of whack-a-mosquito. And I lost again!

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599147,"My second day in New Jersey had a couple events that are not the norm. I was passing close to the town of Unionville, NY, and this gave me a chance to swing in for town food. I arrived at the local pizza place about ten minutes after they opened at 11:00 AM. They sold pizza by the slice but none was available yet. I ordered a sub sandwich, salad and had two pink lemonades. Today was a hot and humid day and the lemonades were very cold. Perhaps the best cold beverages I've had on the trail.
After eating lunch I stopped into the general store to pick up a new roll of toilet paper. I grabbed a Reeses peanut butter dark chocolate for dessert. I then walked back the half mile to the trailhead to resume hiking.
The second event of the day was coming across the Adams family from New Jersey. I came up to the parents first and chatted with them while hiking through a marshy area. Some of this area was on elevated planks just a foot or so above the ground. Other parts were layered with a small amount of water. For the most part, I was able to avoid getting my shoes too wet. It turns out Mrs. Adams has ties to Strongsville, Ohio. She was familiar with the locations of Sheffield Lake and Avon. If my memory serves me correctly, her brother lives or once lived in Avon. After I moved ahead of them they said the group of three girls ahead was there two daughters and a friend of the daughters. They've been going hiking for many years and now the daughters' pace has passed that of the parents. It is always great to see family doing some hiking on the trail. They were just doing a specific section, not through-hiking like me.
Today was a short day for miles. The heat got the best of me and I called it a day about 2:30. Parts of the trail were a long stretch of road and a hike around a wide open marsh. Both were just after noon and the sun was out in full force. I chose to tent instead of stay in the shelter. I'd had enough of the mosquitos the past two nights.

In the morning I walked to the bear box near the shelter to retrieve my food bag and passed by their tents on my return. As I passed I smelled coffee brewing. Not but a few seconds later I hear Mrs. Adams say, ""Jawz, would you care for a cup of coffee or some oatmeal?"" Without hesitation I chose the coffee. She put in some almond milk and let me tell you the coffee was awesome! It was a great way to start the day. I also had the opportunity to speak in length with Mr. Adams about plastics and their affects on the environment. Before I left they gave me oatmeal packets for another day. Thank you Adams family for adding to my adventure with your trail magic. I hope your camping trip was great!
Today's hike was very challenging. It had a little bit of everything. There were easy parts, stretches of elevated boardwalk, a large tough climb up Stairway to Heaven (fantastic view), many small talks with area hikers, and walks along mountain ridges. It was along one of these ridges I came across familiar faces. It was Rachel and her two sons, ages 14 and now 10 (not 9, I was corrected since he's had a birthday since I last saw them just before entering the Smoky Mountains). They were having some food right at the NJ/NY line. They jumped ahead of me on the trail to ensure they had enough time to reach Maine before bad weather sets in. Then they will return and pick up where they left off. I think it was somewhere in Virginia. It was nice to see this family again. I wish them the best on their adventure. Rachel took a photo of me at the state line and sent it to me, thanks. Also here while chatting, a father and daughter came to the state line then went back. I'd met them at the campsite. He gave me a cliff bar before heading home. They were hiking just the state of New Jersey. Thanks for your trail magic.
Earlier in the day I came across a cooler at a road crossing. It was filled with cold beverages. I chose an iced tea and left a thank you note in their log book.

It worked well as I slept well and had no rain to deal with in tent setup or take down. With the good night's rest I was ready for today's hike. Before I left camp a section hiker gave me a prepared meal kit, three protein bars and some trail mix. It was his last day on trail and I'm thankful for his kindness.
I call today the rollercoaster because it was a long series of uphill climbs followed by nearly immediate downhills. We hikers don't mind the climbs so much if when we're done we get to coast for awhile. But to immediately head back down increases the chances of another uphill coming that much sooner. And so it was. It wasn't the famous Coney Island rollercoaster but the hiking version instead. All challenging and rewarding at the same time.
I've been coming across south-bounders now, or SOBOs. These are hikers that have chosen to start at Mount Katahdin and hike south. In talking with them, they've been on the trail for about two months. That means I'm about two months from reaching Mount Katahdin. It is good to see light at the end of the tunnel. SOBOs start later in the year due to the weather being colder up north verses Georgia. One of the SOBOs I came across was named 'Hustle'. We chatted for a few minutes and I paid-foward the trail magic I received in the morning by giving Hustle a king size Payday. He was very grateful and thanked me kindly.
Today I came across a rattlesnake. I didn't expect to see any this far north. It was about 10 feet of the trail and moving slow, probably looking for the next meal. Another hiker had just passed it and gave me the heads-up. My phone was packed away so sorry no photo or video.
When I arrived at the shelter I once again chose to setup my tent. No need to battle with the bugs. I also had some pain develop in my right foot about 30 minutes before hiking ended. I'll see how that feels in the morning. For book followers, mile 1,394.7 page 142.","Wildcat Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599327,"What a day today was! There was a little bit of everything. For starters, the next shelter is known for having a view of the Hudson River and New York City. The shelter was six-tenths of a mile off trail though. I had only one choice, I needed to see the city. My mother, now passed, was born in New York City. I eagerly hiked the extra mileage in anticipation of the view. It was a clear sky but a bit hazy. The city was about 75 miles away but I was able to make out a few tall buildings on the skyline. I said a prayer to my mom while in view of her birth city.
The trail after that was through forest and mountain areas. I was able to stop atop a mountain and have lunch sitting upon a memorial bench with a fantastic view. From there I came across two hikers that looked out of place. I said there must be a parking lot nearby, there was. At the state park I came across vending machines and treated myself to two vitamin waters and a can of Pringles. Oh did those treats hit the spot on a hot day!
From there I hiked downhill to a small lake. On the descent I saw many locals who had no idea what a through-hiker was or that they were actually on the AT. I cleared it up for many of them as they climbed to a local landmark tower. At the bottom I had to walk through the picnic area around the lake. This was pure torture as I walked through the smell of grills and food. I was too proud to ask for a handout. Then I saw a gentleman carrying food on a platter. Surely there must be a food stand in the area. My eyes panned quickly and shazzam! I went to the stand and ordered two New York famous Nathan's hot dogs and a Gatorade. That was a New York miracle!
As I continued with hiking I next had to hike through a small zoo. This was a bit odd as I wasn't interested in the animals as much as following the signs to pass through. It was easy miles though. Upon exiting I then had to cross the Hudson River by walking across a toll bridge, although free to foot traffic. Sister Barb would have liked the views (see photo section). Upon the other side I was back to climbing a mountain. All the open area walking made me continuously thirsty.
Eventually I reached a small gas station with a grill and stopped here for dinner and to resupply some trail foods. For dinner I had two stuffed peppers, red potatoes, and a bag of corn chips. All washed down with an ice cold flavored seltzer water.
After dinner it was a short one mile hike to a ball field that the owners let hikers stay at for free. I was able to take a cold outdoor shower, get into my tent early, and post a couple online journal entries. Today was a great day with all the non-traditional things you'd expect hiking.

I was not looking forward to a day of hiking in the rain. But, sitting around doing nothing all day is not going to add to completing the adventure.
The rain let up enough to motivate me to get moving. I had the luxury of a nearby pavilion to move my stuff into so that I could at least be dry while eating breakfast and packing up. I was the last to hit the trail, leaving about 9:30 AM. At this point it was just a mist and how I prayed it would remain so. No such luck. The rain came soon and I was totally drenched. As mentioned before, once you're wet the hiking gets easier since you no longer have to avoid water.
Around noon I came to a road crossing and caught up to two hikers that beat me out of camp. One was drinking from a soda can while talking to a gentleman standing with the hatchback of his vehicle open. My couriousity peaked. Could it be trail magic? The gentleman called me over to his vehicle and opened a cooler of drinks. He offered and I chose a Gatorade and also snatched four cookies. He's a local hiker and goes by the trail name of 'Briface', given to him by his daughter. From this point forward the day became much more enjoyable. Even when it poured again later I couldn't care less. I was getting in miles in tough conditions and one day closer to the ultimate goal. Thanks Briface for the pick my up!
When I arrived at the shelter, which was unique in that there were bunks and was located near a road for food delivery, I found all the bunks were taken. Initially disappointed, I looked around and noticed I could fit my air mattress under a table and that is where I setup. I was out of people's way and would avoid any future rain.

I also got a deli pickle, two bags of chips and Hostess cupcakes and a seltzer water. And yes, I ate it all as my lunch. The pickle was especially good. They cut it into four spears for me.

Lately, my hiking clothes are not getting a chance to dry out from one day to the next. Putting on wet clothes to go hiking is no picnic. But there's really no alternative when you're deep in the woods. At least at the shelter I was able to put on dry clothes for the night.

I decided to have a positive attitude and get my miles in regardless of the weather and wet clothes. I figured these wet days would eventually end and until then I'd just keep getting one day closer to Mount Katahdin in Maine.
For most of the day the hiking conditions were good and I moved from New York to Connecticut. Another state in the books. This day had a bit of everything; slippery planks, elevated boardwalk, cow pastures, woods, and a big mountain climb. I was moving steadily along until about 3:00 PM in the afternoon when thunder began in the distance behind me. I knew there was no chance to outrun the rain. It was just a matter of how long I could postpone the inevitable. When I passed a hiker from Germany named 'Kermit', she was stopped putting on her pack's rain cover. I've encountered her many times going back to Pearisburg, Virginia. It wasn't long before I came up to her friend named 'Compass'. I told Compass we were about to get hit hard. She said she didn't like storms.
When the storm hit it was the worst one I've encountered on my adventure. The rain came down heavy. And to make matters worse I was near the top of a mountain, hiking just below the ridge line. On an incline I came across a woman hiding under a poncho. She peaked out and said she didn't want to cross the ridge until the rain stopped. I told her I was pressing on. Whether or not that was smart on my part could be questioned. The thunder and lightning were just above me. It was scary and awesome at the same time. In spots I could see off the side of the mountain it was just a wall of water. I made it over the mountain and began descending to my destination shelter.
It was a small shelter with four hikers and one very large dog. There was no more room. I asked if I could sit on the edge until the rain passed. Before coming off the mountain I could see clear skies behind the storm. Once it stopped raining I setup my tent and changed into dry clothes. I did not come out of the tent the rest of the evening or night. Kermit and Compass had made it to camp and so did the woman hiding under the poncho. She was with them and goes by 'Moon Pie'.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599696,"You read that right, only 7.3 miles hiked today. Here's how the day went down to arrive at such a low total.
As you have read, I've been getting hit with rain for quite a few days now.  And today the rain started as I was informed the night before, at about 5:00 AM. I was in no rush to leave a dry tent. With all the tenting I've been doing lately I've gotten better at staying dry. While in the tent I contemplated my options since I'd already hiked nine days straight. I could rest in camp, my legs were crying for it,  or suck it up and hike in the rain again. I snoozed off and on until about 10:30 when I noticed the rain seemed to stop. I had cell service so I checked the weather forecast and it was clearing up for the rest of the day. Compass was up and moving so I exited my tent to check on her plans.
She and her two friends were going to hike into the town of Kent, Connecticut. It was only a third of a mile hiking downhill then a mile walk into town on route 341. Kermit had to resupply and there was a laundromat in town as well. This got me to thinking. Why not get to town and do laundry and a small resupply to last until Great Barrington, Massachusetts? From there I could decide what to do and that became my plan and I started moving to put the plan in motion.
Once in town, which was crowded with a car show and a sidewalk tag sale events, I found Compass at the Kent visitor center. She was going to hang there for awhile and recharge her phone. From there I hit the ATM next door and started walking to the laundromat. Low and behold I ran into hiker Boogerbear whom I haven't seen in almost two weeks. He was going to have lunch so I joined him. I had a french dip sandwich and he an overpriced $12 salad. We were both shocked to see a salad arrive that was no bigger than a large bagel. To be fair, they nailed it on the presentation aspect as it was walled-up by length wise cucumber slices. Food prices have been rising the farther north I get. Talking over lunch Boogerbear said he was hiking out of town afterwards.
I moved on to do my laundry and updated my online journal while waiting. Then I bought some resupply at an IGA and went back to the visitor center to charge my phone while packing up the food. I decided to get back on the trail and tent to be on the trail for the following morning. Oh, I got ice cream on the way out of town, yum! I hiked longer than planned since I couldn't find a valid tenting spot. It started getting dark and I realized I was closing in on the first shelter away from town. There'd surely be tenting sites around the shelter. The last 45 minutes I was hiking along a river which was as easy as is gets. I did have to put on my headlamp for the last 30 minutes, my first experience with night hiking. Although not scary to me, night hiking stinks! It was tough to follow the white blaze markers on the trees. Eventually I made the shelter and tripped on a tree root and fell about 30 yards from where I camped. I setup in the dark using my headlamp and was in the tent at 9:18 PM.
That's how I had a short day of hiking but a very productive day which left me feeling great. When I awoke the following morning I found I'd setup right next to hiker Moon Pie, and Compass and Kermit were in camp as well. For book followers, mile 1,475.4 page 148.","Mt Algo Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599715,"Hip hip hoorah! I awoke to a day of no rain and the forecast looked great for the next few days. During my morning I talked briefly with Compass about my night hiking experience the night before. We also discussed a steep downward climb from the day before. It was scary as it had to be at about a 65 degree angle looking up from the bottom. She was pleased to hear a guy say how tough it was rather than being macho and saying it was no big deal. She appreciated the honesty. This descent was so tough, very rocky, that I fear any fall would end any hiker's adventure.
The day's hike began by again following the Housatonic River. It was nice scenery as I was within 10 yards of the river most of this time. One thing I learned about hiking the Appalachian Trail is that easy hiking doesn't last forever nor for very long. I think it's designed specifically to be this way. The trail undergoes minor rerouting each year and I've heard other hikers say it's to make it harder and harder.
After the riverside hiking which was a nice warm-up, the trail turned to a series of climbs and decends. Not a real surprise either as I'm moving farther north where the frequency of mountains are on the rise. The days of easy trail in New Jersey and New York are behind me. Time to get my legs back in shape for the mountains to come in the final three states.
Today I met a hiker named 'Trash Panda'. She's a younger southbound hiker and was refilling her water bottles at a small stream. We had a pleasant conversation which included the town of Great Barrington, my next planned town to visit on my adventure. I also played leap frog with Boogerbear. Seemed I'd pass him then take a break only to have him pass me, then I'd return the favor. Eventually the two of us reached one of the final climbs in Connecticut. The climb was about 1,000 feet over 2.5 miles. My destination shelter was just over the mountain's peak. Boogerbear was going to night hike past the shelter to reach Great Barrington a day earlier than I. He was trying to catch his former hiking group. I was just trying to wrap up my day and pushed best I could all the way up to beat the setting sun.
This was the beginning of a bad decision which you'll read about in the next couple of entries. When I arrived at the side trail to the shelter, Boogerbear was there taking a break and said the shelter was a half mile off the main trail. He couldn't afford the extra distance given his schedule. I said farewell and headed down the side trail and it was no piece of cake. Once I arrived I had just enough time to setup my tent, quickly eat dinner, and get into the tent to avoid the wrath of mosquitos. They were terrible in this area of the woods.
Another day of adventure was in the books and tomorrow I'd be hiking into my 11th state of the trail, Massachusetts. For book followers, mile 1,496.7 page 149.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599740,"One of the dangers of hiking is proper water consumption. To date, I've done a great job in this area. Even in areas where water was scarce I'd planned accordingly. However, yesterday evening was the beginning of a mistake on my part.
I was in such a hurry to climb the mountain that I skipped opportunities to drink water. When I arrived at the shelter and used water to cook dinner and brush my teeth I was left with less than a liter on hand. There was not a good source of water at the shelter either. Therefore, when I began today's hiking, and with the large climb to end yesterday, my system was already in trouble. I had an upset stomach in the early hours of hiking. I feared that I'd caught some stomach bug from another hiker or worse, an ailment from improperly filtered water. I was in the process of another climb now and with the heat I was heavily sweating. There was even a constant drip of sweat from my elbows. I came across a shelter at about 11:30 AM and took an hour break here. There was a good source of water so I drank often during the hour.
Just before leaving to resume hiking I had to pee. And there it was, two symptoms of severe dehydration. My urine output was low and a dark amber color. Sorry if mentioning this grosses you out, but it is reality. For the rest of the day I tried to drink as often and as much as possible. The fact there were three tough climbs today of about 2,700 feet didn't help either. I had to take more frequent breaks than I normally have in the past. You heard me mention before that the trail has a way of providing what's needed and it happened again today. About one mile from my destination shelter, I came across a small parking lot with two picnic tables each with a cooler of very cold water and gallon jugs of air temperature water. They were labeled with signs saying for through-hikers only. I took an extended break here and drank about 1.5 liters of water and topped off my supply. I hoped this would remedy the dehydration. Thanks to the anonymous trail angel for the water.
There were good aspects of today's hiking to mention. I've crossed Connecticut off the list and moved into Massachusetts. And the adventure has surpassed 1,500 adventure miles. Wow! Seriously, who'd of thought a 50-year old with no hiking experience to speak of would make it this far on the trail? Of course I'd hoped I would, but had my doubts. Now I'm about six to seven weeks away from Mount Katahdin in Maine. Just a little more luck, hard work, and you're support and we'll make it there. I also setup my tent next to a hiker from Massachusetts. He's in his 60's and been hiking since he was 8 years old and we had a long, great conversation about hiking and life in general. As the day ended I put myself only eight miles from the town of Great Barrington. For book followers, mile 1,513.8 page 156.","Limestone Spring Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599836,"Oh yes! Today I'm hiking into town. Only eight miles to highway US 7 but from there three miles west to the edge of town. I'd worry about the three after I did the eight of hiking.
There were a couple hours of moderate hiking then the terrain became mostly flat. It was especially hot today, even in the morning hours as I was off to an early start. The last hour or so of hiking was characterized by my legs begging for a break. Today was the thirteenth day in a row of hiking without a rest, totaling 227 adventure miles. And there were more miles of town time and side trails to shelters and water sources, all while wearing a backpack. I'm sure the total mileage on my feet wearing a backpack over this stretch was closer to 250.
I didn't find any shuttle service listed in the book so I just started walking to town upon reaching highway US 7. It was about 11:00 AM and hotter now that I was out of the woods and on blacktop. I'm guessing I walked about three-fourths of a mile when a car stopped and offered a ride as far as the supermarket. That was perfect! I needed to stop at the supermarket anyhow and from there I could walk to the Days Inn. The gentleman that gave me the ride was named Joelle. He was 78 years old and had a bicycle mounted to the back of his car. He's cycling now for therapy after knee surgery. He lives in the town of Sheffield, Massachusetts. How ironic! In Ohio, I live in the city of Sheffield Lake and my sister Rose lives in Sheffield. We only talked briefly as the ride was short for a car.
At the supermarket I bought a fruit salad, a hot foods pack of 25 chicken nuggets and two bottles of cold seltzer water. I ate my lunch siting at a bench outside the store. Afterwards, I walked to the Days Inn, about a mile, and was checked-in and in my room in about ten minutes. I was happy to not have to wait for a later check-in time. I'd only had one cold shower (without soap) in 13 days and occasionally rinsed down in streams. Therefore, I went straight into the tub to take a hot bath. Later I had dinner at GB Eats consisting of Italian wedding soup, a cheeseburger and fries. Then I bought some snacks for the rest of the day and had ice cream at the SoCo Creamery before returning to my room.
I decided to take the following day for a full day of rest given the heat and my symptoms of dehydration. On my day off I ate the hotel's free breakfast, had pizza for lunch, and bought fresh fruit and sushi rolls from the supermarket for dinner. I stayed off my feet most of the day, leaving the room only in the early evening to visit the SoCo Creamery for another waffle cone.
I'll be back on the trail August 9th to begin hiking to the small town of Dalton. It is 48 trail miles away and I'll be there Saturday morning. Once there, I have two packages to pick-up and I'll be meeting my friend Joe Durivage. He's making the short trip from nearby Albany, New York. See you soon Joe!

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600127,"After my rest in Great Barrington I was ready to get back on the trail to complete another adventure day. Before heading out I indulged in the hotel's free breakfast and ate six slices of raison bread with cream cheese, jam and peanut butter. While there I ran into the hiker known as 'The Chemist'. I last seen him the day before I left the Shanendoahs. That's nearly six weeks ago. It was good to catch-up on his hike. He had to hike through a foot issue and seems good now.
I wasn't as fortunate in my departure of town as I was on my entrance. I had to walk the three miles back to the trailhead. No passerby stopped to offer a ride like Joelle did when I arrived. I really didn't mind as the weather was nice and much cooler than the previous three days.
Hiking today went well except for the wet areas on the trail. It seems there has been plenty of rain lately and the trails were overcome with water. In these soggy areas there were large rocks and sometimes small logs thrown into the trail to assist with getting through without taking on too much mud. I did my best and really can't complain.
But there is an area where I'd like to file a complaint. I was hoping for a day of hiking around 20 miles. Need to keep the daily average around 20 to keep the adventure on schedule for a mid-late September finish. Well, at a shelter where I was taking a break I came across three south bounders who overheard I was targeting a particular campsite for the evening. Apparently, this campsite is currently being ransacked on a regular basis by a female bear and her three cubs. I certainly wasn't willing to risk camping there and the Massachusetts parks staff wants hikers to avoid camping there anyhow. I re-analyzed the guide and determined the shelter past the campsite was too much of a stretch given my late departure from the hotel. Wasting an hour walking back to the trailhead didn't help either. The only thing I could do was have a short mileage day and go big tomorrow. The shelter I stayed at was wide open so I setup my small tent inside to act as a safety net from any pesky bugs. It worked and I slept well. Yo bears, leave our food bags alone!

",Mt Wilcox North Shelter,"Aug 09, Thu",13.50
Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600189,"Thanks to the aggressive bear family in the area I had plenty of work to do today. My goal was to hike 22.8 miles at a minimum. I was hoping to go a few more to get closer to the town of Dalton. Doing so would help ensure I was able to get to the post office by the noon closing time the following day. The x-factor here would mean I'd have to find a suitable tenting location that wasn't already established if I hiked past the shelter at 22.8 miles.
Hiking today was relatively easy except for two medium climbs and navigating the muddy portions of trail. My estimate is that about 25% of today's trail was muddy and required extra care. My shoes are virtually bald having worn them since Pearisburg, Virginia. Just a little over 30 miles to go and these shoes will be pitched as new ones are waiting for my arrival in Dalton. Until then, avoiding slipping is a primary concern. At one point I was hiking just ahead of The Chemist and my right food slid down the side of the hiking path. I escaped a complete fall, but my leg that retained its grip on the trail was totally stretched as I went to a squatting position with the right leg fully extended downward off trail. My trekking poles undoubtedly saved me from an injury.
I came across trail magic two times today. The first was a cooler with large Gatorades and some sharp cheddar cheese. That was a nice score since I was headed up a climb right afterwards. The second time was also a cooler, two coolers in fact, and two individuals were rifling through them as I approached. In talking with them, they work for the Massachusetts park department and were in the process of removing the coolers. They are not in favor of unattended food being left for hikers since it attracts bears. They did offer me any of the food or drink so I guzzled a large Gatorade, leaving the empty bottle in the cooler.
At about 4:30 PM I approached a bush alongside the trail that started moving. Based on the noise and movement and being at the base of a tree, I pegged it for being a squirrel. The trail is loaded with squirrels and chipmunks. When I passed the bush I looked back and was surprised to see a porcupine walking away into the woods. I've heard of them from other hikers but this was my first experience of seeing a porcupine in the wild. Thankfully, he was not bothered by my presence and went about his business as I did mine.
When I arrived at the shelter I did an assessment and decided to call it a day, leaving 12 miles to hike the next day to get to the post office. For book followers, mile 1,558 page 160.","Mt Wilcox North Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600192,"I went to bed early last night because I needed to wake up early this morning. It was 12 miles to Dalton and although I've been averaging 2.5 miles per hour, the more conservative estimate would be 2 miles per hour. That means I'd need 6 hours to hike the 12 miles to get to the post office by closing. Throw in an hour of cushion time and I'd need to start hiking at 5:00 AM.
With my plan in place I awoke at 4:15 AM and started to pack up. I had heard there was rain coming and it did drizzle for about 15 minutes around 2:00 AM. But when I awoke it was not raining and I was happy for that outcome. I did fully expect it to begin raining at any time though. As quietly as I could I packed and slipped out of camp. I skipped eating breakfast, brushing my teeth, and doing my morning pushups.
It was weird to start hiking so early since it was basically pitch black. My headlamp lit the trail fairly well, but the blaze markers on the trees were tough to spot. As long as the trail didn't split I'd be fine. I do not recall any splits in the first hour. Around 6:00 AM the trail started to illuminate slowly from a rising sun, albeit a cloudy sky. By 7:00 AM I'd put the headlamp away since even areas deep in the woods were bright enough to hike with only natural light. In the first hour I went 2.3 miles, easy to determine from crossing a road. I was well on my way to making the post office in time.
At around 8:30 AM I came upon a shelter and stopped in to take care of my morning tasks. I ate some breakfast even though I'd had two snacks while on the trail, then brushed my teeth and did 38 pushups on the floor of the shelter. When I got there I was surprised to run into hiker Red Bard. I hadn't seen him since Delaware Water Gap when we split a room at the Pocono Inn.
I arrived at the post office about 10:45 AM and picked-up my two packages. One from my sister Laura with my new shoes and a few other small items. The second from my cousin Ed and Rose Yonushatis. Thank you all for supporting the adventure and getting these well needed supplies and gear to me. I think Ed is trying to fatten me back up since I've lost so much weight on the trail. The care package was great!
Must we not forget to mention my visiting with a good friend. Before my adventure began, Joe Durivage and I discussed meeting in Dalton. He lives just about an hour away, in or nearby Albany, NY, and works for my former employer. When we talked about this it seemed way to far in the future to have any significance. And yet, here we were meeting in Dalton. We had a great visit while conversing over great food at Applebees. Joe also brought me some supplies including much needed Injinji toe socks which keep blisters away. They should last the remainder of the adventure. Thanks Joe for lunch and the supplies! Glad we were able to include the visit as part of the adventure. I promise one day to visit you in New York, perhaps we'll go fishing.
The rain didn't come until after 11:00 AM. After Joe left I spent the rest of the day relaxing at the Shamrock Inn. Late afternoon it really poured and I was glad to be in the comforts of the inn. For book followers, mile 1,569.8 page 160.","October Mountain Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600676,"When I awoke the day after Joe's visit there was a light rain. It is always tough to leave town and head back to the trail when it is raining. To get the motor running I went next door for a coffee and a bagel. There I ran into a hiker named 'Ziplock' whom I haven't seen since McAfee's Knob in Virginia. She was with a young hiker named 'Re-run' and they were discussing splitting a room. I saw an opportunity to hide from the rain. I joined with them and we split a room at the Econolodge. I had to sleep on my air mattress on the floor, but it was dry!
I spent the extra day relaxing around the room. I only left to go to Panera for lunch and to a Chinese buffet for dinner. Sad part is it only drizzled for the early morning and was fine after that. I can't speak for certain about what was going on up in the mountains weather wise. At first I felt bad for trying to dodge the rain, but an extra day of rest was good. I also got good intel from Ziplock since she has already hiked north to Mount Katahdin from Dalton and was now heading south to complete her journey. Ziplock is from Australia and it turns out Re-run is from Chagrin Falls, Ohio.
When I returned to hiking I had new shoes and was happy to have them. I'd worn the second pair for about 900 miles and they were pretty much toast. I felt every bump on the trail and their grip was totally worthless. Combining the shoes with the new socks from Joe and hiking felt great again, not like a chore. The new shoes didn't stay clean long. Lately, since leaving Great Barrington, the trails have been loaded with mud. They don't need to look pretty, just feel good and hold their grip.
I climbed Mount Greylock today, the highest peak in Massachusetts. The higher I climbed, the worse the fog became. There is a 30 to 40 feet tall stone monument atop the mountain. I didn't see it with a clear line of sight until I was about 40 feet away. That's how foggy it was. It was another three miles to the shelter and on this side of the mountain it was raining. When I arrived at the shelter there were a dozen individuals in the shelter sitting in a circle. Luckily, it was a group of young kids out doing trail maintenance. They were playing a card game before dinner. They were all tenting and this left me as the first hiker to claim a spot, which I needed to avoid the rain. Eventually another hiker arrived followed by a group of four that were just hiking for camp activity. Two in this group were young kids.
The real highlight of the day was stopping in the small town of Cheshire, Massachusetts, for a coffee, bagel and donut at Dunkin Donuts. And, I did 20.5 miles in mud, fog and rain.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600692,"Today I crossed from Massachusetts into Vermont. Trail wise, it was nothing special. There was a simple, plain sign indicating the point of the states' borders. The weather wasn't great. There was no fantastic view at this location. It was just the next state on the adventure. Vermont is number 12 of 14 states on the trail.
With Vermont came even more mud on the trail. This is not purely from rain, but from poorly designed trails. There are few water diversions built into the trail like those in the south. Therefore, the water follows the worn trails for extended periods. We call these Appalachian Trail Rivers. I've come across mud pits up to 12 feet in diameter. For these, I look for rocks in the mud to frog-hop or I walk the edge which is seldom level. Walking the edge eventually grows the mud pit. Not ideal, but with mud comes wet feet and no hiker wants that issue.
Today I've crossed over the 1,600 adventure miles milestone. That is awesome! When I reached 100 miles I said I could do 100 more. Same with when I reached 200, 400 and 800. Now with reaching 1,600, I'm left with 590 miles. Mentally, that is easily doable. By doing 100 miles a week I can be home in six weeks, nice. There will be more mountains now, but nothing more intense than I've climbed in the south. Now it is simply a numbers game. Do my daily miles and six weeks should go by quick.
Before crossing into Vermont, I passed through the small town of North Adams, Massachusetts. I took a small detour off the trail, about a half mile extra, to visit the supermarket. There I bought a hot coffee, a pistachio muffin, and a role of toilet paper. The trail provides privies to do your business, not the paper. To date, my timing has been good having to dig only four cat holes in the woods.
I'm looking forward to northern Vermont. From southbound hikers I've heard the mud up north is not an issue. Until then you can just call me Mr. Muddy. For book followers, mile 1,607.4 page 164.","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600694,"I was not looking forward to another day of dodging mud. It really makes for a long day of hiking. You constantly slow down on approaching mud to assess the best way to navigate it. Keeping a nice pace with this type of trail is nearly impossible. The feet get tired more quickly by being forced to pivot off rocks, roots, and being placed on slanted surfaces. Mentally it is tough as well. Each step must be precise to avoid rolling or twisting an ankle. I've found I need to take more frequent breaks while hiking these muddy trails.
I've spoken of trail magic many times. And how the trail magic can brighten a dismal day. Today I found trail magic at road Vermont 9. A former hiker that goes by the name of 'Dark Cloud' was there providing some trail magic. He was also a mushroom enthusiast and we talked about all the mushrooms on the trail. Let me tell you, I've easily seen over 50 types of mushrooms or fungi. I've even seen one that was the most beautiful color of purple. I've seen hikers harvest and eat mushrooms. A popular one is called chicken of the woods. I avoid eating any of them. A mistake could be deadly. From Dark Cloud I enjoyed an apple cider, three snack size candies, a water, and four apple cider flavored mini donuts. He also took food trash off my hands saving me a few ounces. Thanks Dark Cloud! We hikers appreciate your kindness.
I wish the trail magic made the rest of the hiking day a dream. But today it seamed as though I was always hiking uphill. And per the guide, I was. Most of the uphill was gradual but there were some steep climbs. Luckily, the steep sections weren't for long periods. I did get the satisfaction of a lookout tower on top of Glastenbury Mountain. The views were nice but it sure was windy in the tower above the tree line. The Vermont views (1-4) were taken from this tower. For book followers, mile 1,626.1 page 165.","Congdon Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600709,"There is a weird thing happening here in Vermont. With the passing of each day hiking in the mud, I'm beginning to not be so bothered by the mud. It is not going to dry up and it does appear to be becoming less frequent. And, I'm making my mileage goals. I guess it is like learning a new skill. The more you hike in mud the better you become at it and the mind is freed-up to think other thoughts. Sooner or later the mud will cease.
A good thing has happened since I've left Connecticut. The bugs are slowly becoming less of an issue. It could be the return of mountainous areas are working in my favor. It is cooler in the evenings and at night. Perhaps the mosquitos don't like these conditions. This has allowed me to return to sleeping in shelters rather than setting up a tent around the shelter. If my memory is correct, I think the last time I used my tent was August 9. I'm avoiding a wet tent and saving setup and teardown time. I'd like to say it has translated to more daily miles. But the truth is I'm getting to sleep sooner and sleeping longer.
Today I climbed Stratton Mountain. It was a climb of approximately 2,000 feet over a distance of three miles. The peak was at 3,936 feet. There was a lookout tower atop the mountain. The views were nice but would have been better on a very clear day. The surrounding mountains appeared to be plagued with a haze which took away any vividness. After I hiked off the mountain I came upon a hiker named 'Twig'. He is from Marietta, Ohio. We spoke for a couple minutes then I moved onward to my destination shelter.
The shelter I stayed at today was a half mile from the main trail. This would add a whole extra mile for the round trip. Not ideal, but I was stopping here for the night. Also, I decided to go to the town of Manchester Center tomorrow to resupply. I'll resupply to have enough food for a minimum of six days since the town of Hanover, New Hampshire, is 100 miles away.

The plan was to spend overnight in town and return to the trail the next day. Plans don't always go smooth.
The hike went well as the Vermont mud wasn't as prevalent in the short stretch to the road to town. And it was mostly level terrain with some occasional downhill sections. I passed a hiker along the way who said rain was pushed back a few hours, from 11 AM to 1 PM. I was happy to hear this news as I planned to walk the 2.5 miles to the hotel and be there by noon. When I arrived at the trailhead I had no cell signal to contact the hotel to confirm a room was available. There were rain clouds in the distance so I started walking to town. Clouds move fast around mountains and it started raining within minutes after I started walking. The news of rain holding off until 1 PM didn't hold up. I don't know the precise reason(s) why, but I don't hitchhike. Within three-quarters of a mile a car stopped and offered a ride, I accepted. His name was Pat and he had just dropped off his son at the trailhead I just left. In talking with Pat we are very similar. He turned 50 on March 1st, I the 9th. He decided to do something different, similar to me, and moved to Vermont from New Jersey. At least one of his kids thought this was nuts, that nobody just picks-up and moves. After living in a hotel for a couple of months, I'm happy to say he and his family are doing well. Thanks for the ride Pat and best wishes to you and your family.
The part of my plan that didn't go well was rains came heavy this evening. There were flash flood warnings and it was still raining in the morning when I awoke. I made the decision to take a full day off and let the rains pass. The next three days had favorable forecasts. Since I spent $20 for a round trip to town the day before I just lounged in my room all day. I only left to walk to Bob's Diner for lunch which was about 100 yards from the hotel.

The trails were muddy today and I expected them to be with all the rain. The sun was out and I was staying dry and doing my best to avoid the mud. There were four climbs today, each with its own peak. Only one of the four peaks lead to great scenery. I'd been hoping for more having put in hard work on each climb.
For the first time since the adventure began, I spent a night all alone in the woods. The shelter I stayed in was located alongside a large, noisy river. I do not believe this was the reason no one else chose to stay the night. There were close options before and after this shelter which I think was the main reason. Whatever the reason, it was weird to be alone in the woods. I setup my tent inside the shelter to screen out the bugs even though they haven't been too big a problem since early Massachusetts. With the noise, being inside the tent, and in total darkness, I did feel vulnerable. There would be no advance notice of an approaching bear or someone up to no good.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601096,"About shortly after midnight I awoke and exited the shelter to tinkle in the woods. It was a perfectly clear night and it allowed a gaze upwards at the night sky. There was a small clear patch in the trees around the shelter. Even with being half asleep the view was great. It was one of my intents to witness a clear night sky while on the adventure. Sadly I've not done this. It seems once I get to camp the focus is to setup for the night and I'm usually in bed by the time its dark enough to enjoy a clear sky. Hiker midnight is about 9 PM. I'm hoping to observe a clear sky in the mountains of New Hampshire.
I think about many things while hiking and today I was thinking of how I miss going into a garden and picking fresh vegetables. I'm hoping when I return home my neighbor has some vegetables left in his garden. Before I left I asked he plant a little extra for my return. Well today on the trail after thinking about this I came upon a road to cross. Under the guardrail next to the trail was a cardboard box. I looked in the box and it contained fresh home grown cucumbers. Amazing, the trail provides once again! I took the biggest one, wiped it off, and enjoyed it. The only thing missing was some salt.
I climbed Bear Mountain today which was just over a 1,000 feet climb. It seems every state I've been through has a Bear Mountain. If you're ever unsure about a mountain's name, go with Bear Mountain. You've a good chance to be correct.
After I crossed the Claredon Gorge I came to the trailhead at VT 103. There was a small parking lot there and some trail magic was taking place. A father and son were providing grilled food and some sides. I enjoyed a turkey cheeseburger, two brownies and an ice cold seltzer water. The son hiked the Appalachain Trail a few years ago. It is common for those that have hiked to return and do trail magic. I know how thankful I am of the trail magic and hope to someday return as the provider of said magic.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601419,"I needed to do a big day to avoid having to tent randomly on the side of the trail. Gifford Woods State Park was about 20 miles away and that became my target destination. They have a special section for AT through-hikers but the details were sketchy.
The trails have been getting less and less muddy the farther north I go in Vermont. My feet are thankful for this! The hiking is back to a more comfortable activity. I climbed Mount Killington today to a peak elevation of just over 4,000 feet. The climb on the trail in elevation was over 2,000 feet. To do so, I needed to take the side trail to the summit which was .2 miles. This was optional, but I'm certainly glad I did the work. I left my backpack at the shelter as the climb was quite vertical. The views at the top were spectacular. The best I've seen in Vermont. Coming back down to the shelter was tough too as the side trail was mostly rocks. If I had my pack with me it would have been tougher.
Once I started down off Mount Killington it was going to be mostly downhill to the state park about 10 miles away. When I was two hours from the park, clouds rolled in and a breeze swept through the woods. It looked as though rain wasn't too far away. When I finally arrived at the start park, I made my way to the park office to see the options available to hikers. They had a special section for hikers to tent at a cost of $6 overnight. I asked the park employee if she knew the weather forecast. She said rain was expected at about 3:00 AM. The cost of a shelter was $27. I hate rain so I opted to pay the extra money to ensure I'd wake up with everything dry. I added two ice creams to my purchase as well.
I walked to the shelter named Oak and setup both my tent and hung a clothesline inside the shelter. It would have easily housed up to eight hikers and it was all mine. After making dinner I went back to the park office to use the Wi-Fi and electricity to charge my phone. Good thing I chose the shelter as the rains came at 2:55 AM and continued through late morning. I really didn't want to hike in the rain so upon packing up camp I went back to the park office to go over my options. The guide listed a motel only .7 miles away. I called, a room was available, and off I went to dodge the rain by taking a rest day. For book followers, mile 1,705.0 page 173.","Clarendon Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601438,"I spent most of yesterday in the room at the Killington Motel. It was a nice change of pace to the traditional hotel. When I opened the door to the room I was greeted by a nice couch. I spent much of my time relaxing on the couch while updating my journal and watching TV. I felt more of being in a living room verses a hotel room. The rest and relaxation were great and I was ready to get back to hiking now that the weather was nice.
The day began with an awesome breakfast. I had pineapple, cranberry bread and six blueberry pancakes. I truly believe they may have been the best I've ever had! The couple running the motel operate it more like a bed and breakfast and it shows their loving touch. They roast coffee as well and sell that as a side business. There were large burlap sacks of coffee beans from other countries in the lobby. I had three cups with breakfast.
When I started hiking it was like I was hiking on air. The sun was out and there was a nice coolness in the air. It felt like an early fall day. When I entered the woods I hiked around a huge pond. With the sun low on the horizon, the shadows and being only 20 feet from the pond's edge, it created a great hiking atmosphere. The mud that was prevalent in southern Vermont was also gone. Before I knew it, I'd hiked the 16.8 miles in only seven hours. I arrived at the shelter by 4:30 PM and wanted to keep on going. But the next shelter was 12.3 miles away and after looking at the guide, I decided to just call it a day. It may have been all the carbs, high caffeine coffee, the rest, the weather, or the combination of all these that made hiking today the easiest day to date.
Since I had time on my hands I was able to chat with the hikers more than usual. And today there were about seven other hikers in camp. One of them was an unexpected ranger. By that I mean he was from North Ridgeville, Ohio. The school district's athletic teams' mascot is the Rangers. His name is Tom and he's lived in northeast Ohio since the year I was born, 1968. He's hiking in Vermont this year. It really is a small world. I also met a 71 year old gentleman hiking south. Each year he does parts of the AT he's not seen before. One hiker brought out a guitar and played a few songs before bedtime arrived. It was a great camp evening. But just like all others it was lights out and all quiet by 9:00 PM. I needed to sleep as I was planning a day of 21 miles tomorrow and the terrain was looking like it would be quite a few ups and downs.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601444,"The plan today was to hike 21 miles. This would leave me with only six miles the following day to hike into the town of Hanover, New Hampshire. That's right, I'd be entering New Hampshire. Once there, the plan was to resupply and enjoy the luxuries of every day life that are not found on the trail.
There were a couple stops on the route today that I was planning to make. The first was 3.8 miles from the shelter where the trail crossed VT 12. Two-tenths to the east down VT 12 was a farm that sold ice cream. Apparently the ease at which I hiked yesterday carried over to today. When I reached VT 12 I'd only been hiking for an hour and 15 minutes. I thought there was no way this could be VT 12 so soon so I crossed the road and pressed on. There were no road signs indicating it was VT 12. Soon I came across a sign saying VT 12 was 1.2 miles south, I was going north. Oh well, I wasn't going backwards since miles are a valuable commodity now.
Prior to reaching the sign I was motoring up a steep incline when a southbound hiker was coming toward me. When he spoke saying I could pass by, I recognized his voice immediately. It was Troop Leader, the former DEA agent I'd last seen in middle Virginia. I'd heard he left the trail due to feet ailments. Upon my reminding him who I was, the beard is much longer now, we chatted and he did leave the trail for awhile to recover. When he came back he went north to Mount Katahdin and summitted and is now hiking southbound to the point in Virginia where he stopped. He's doing great now and we wished each other the best and continued in opposite directions.
About 15 minutes later I'd finished the incline and regained my breath. I was back to moving quickly down the trail. Then without a warning, I didn't see anything in the trail, I rolled my left ankle and fell quickly to the ground. There was no time to catch myself but I had the presence to twist and use my pack to absorb the majority of the impact. I escaped with a couple small scrapes and was able to slowly walk-off the soreness in the ankle. I did hike slower for a few hours as I was worried it would happen again.
Eventually I came to a sign on a tree that was an advertisement from a woman that previously hiked the AT. She and her family now live about 100 yards from the trail and she sells foods and drinks from her back porch. I chose to go there and had a large ice cream cookie sandwich and a Gatorade while talking with two southbound hikers. There was a refrigerator/freezer with prices listed on the covered porch. No one ever came out of the house. There was a cash box there and you wrote down your trail name, items bought, the cost and then paid. I was happy to support the family and missing the ice cream at VT 12 was no big deal now. The second place I visited was three-tenths of a mile from the trail. It was a local farm market that sold meats and cheeses. I bought four ounces of cheese and 1.75 ounces of beef jerky for a total of $9. A bit pricy but it did make for a great snack while taking a break.
By the end of the day my left ankle felt completely fine. I wasn't able to recapture my swiftness from the early morning and yesterday, but I did make the 21.1 miles to the shelter and accomplished my destination goal. I found StriKer at the shelter. She's no longer hiking with Tern and Kiwi as a trio. I was the only one to spend the night in the shelter. StriKer and two others tented in the campsites behind the shelter. Best of all, I'm now setup for a six mile hike into Hanover, New Hampshire, tomorrow morning. For book followers, mile 1,742.9 page 177.","Wintturi Shelter

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601671,"I had a good night's sleep and there was no rush to break camp today. The town of Hanover, home to Dartmouth College, was about six miles away and that was a very short hike. I was leaning toward doing just a resupply and having town food then being on my way. But I will be honest. At this point in the adventure it has become tougher and tougher to get out of town. I'm betting you can correctly guess where this is going.
The morning was slightly foggy when I departed camp. It didn't appear as though it was going to rain and as I suspected the fog slowly dissipated as the morning progressed. The terrain was pretty favorable as well and my excitement grew the closer I became to town. When I finally reached paved road I was thrown a curveball. I had to walk a mile and a half of city streets, all counting as trail miles, before arriving to Hanover. Once there, I sat on a bench in a central park while people played and others walked through. Behind me was part of Dartmouth's campus and it was busy with incoming students. It was nice to watch these young men and women starting their lives away from home. Especially since I have more than 30 years on them. I wondered how many would find themselves at age 50 having as many questions about life on Earth as I do.
It was time to get some town food. One place offered a free donut and another a free slice of pizza to AT through-hikers. I decided to pass on these and visited a small diner named Lou's. I sat at the counter area and loaded up with a big tossed salad, cheeseburger and fries, and finished with an awesome slice of pecan pie. All were great! Now the all important decision. To resupply and hike out of town or spend the night. Hanover is an expensive town for lodging. After a few calls, I found a hotel close to Wal-Mart in the neighboring town of Lebanon. Of course I decided to spend the night. These town visits are part of the adventure. I called upon an Uber and was soon on my way to a hot shower and some rest and relaxation.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601678,"Yesterday, my day in the town of Lebanon, New Hampshire, was nice. After checking into the hotel and taking a shower, I completed a few online journal entries and made a resupply list. Around dinner time I walked the half mile to Applebee's and enjoyed a nice steak dinner with a couple of beers. As luck would have it, they gave me mashed potatoes instead of a baked potato, so I ate them both. Hikers love extra food! After dinner I crossed the street to Wal-Mart and bought six days worth of trail foods.
Today it was time to get back on the trail again. Even out here I am a creature of habit. Every day when I'm back on the actual trail (wooded or dirt portion) I say out loud, ""I'm back on the trail again."" Then I follow with a short prayer for getting through the previous day's adventure and for a good day of adventure today.
Today, the paved portion of trail took me past more sections of the Dartmouth campus. I walked past the small football stadium which had perfect green grass. They probably haven't played their first game yet. Then I moved onward to pass the practice field and a soccer field before finally entering the woods and beginning a small climb. Today had two large claims and with a full pack of food the climbs were tough. That's the one drawback to visiting town. You leave town with a heavy pack that gets lighter with each passing day as you eat a day's worth of food.
I made my destination called the Trapper John Shelter. This must have been the site of an actual trapper. The chimney still stood and the surrounding rocks formed an outline of the old foundation. There was even an old, completely rusted, sewing machine. The shelter was constructed about 20 feet in front of the chimney. I imagine the stream nearby where we took our water from is where Trapper John did his trappings. I was the first one to arrive at the shelter, but by nightfall there were about nine of us in camp. I felt really good today as I begin hiking the state of New Hampshire. It is a tough state having the White Mountains, but it is the next to last state in the adventure.

From here on out, it will be more frequent high, steep climbs and large rocks. On the positive side, the views are getting better and better. There will be days of fewer miles as well. Today was one of those days.
The climb to the summit of Smarts Mountain was very strenuous. It was over 2,000 feet in elevation change over about four miles. Add to that there was a heat advisory in place and you have the recipe for a short day. My goal was to reach the Hexacuba Shelter which was most of the way up Mount Cube after coming down from Smarts Mountain. I arrived at the shelter at approximately 3:00 PM and I was totally exhausted. I ate some trail mix and beef jerky before taking a nap at 4:00 PM. I awoke at 5:30 PM when hiker 'Chuga-Chuga' strolled into camp. He and I would be the only two to camp here for the night. This left me 14.8 miles from a hostel, tomorrow's targeted destination.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602371,"It has been talked about for months. Just wait until you enter the White Mountains of New Hampshire, they're tough! Well, the time has arrived so today's plan was to take some rest and relaxation before entering the Whites by hiking to a hostel.
I took time off the following day staying at the Hikers Welcome Hostel. It wasn't the fanciest hostel. It had an outdoor laundry facility, shower and restroom. The bunk house I stayed in had no electricity. There was a central area that had electricity and this is where we hung out most of the time while watching movies. There wasn't a town close enough to enjoy either. They placed food orders each of the two days and we were shuttled to the small roadside grill for pickup. Both days my dinners were chicken fingers at 80 cents a piece so I loaded up. Ten the first day and only seven the second day but with a large fries.
I did climb Mount Cube today which had a very tough portion to reach the summitt. The peak was small compared to what will soon come. Mount Cube's peak was just shy of 3,000 feet. Mount Washington, the crown jewel of the Whites, is more than double in elevation. These smaller mountains will help me prepare for what most claim is the toughest section of the AT.
With the tough section looming I went through my pack and cut as much weight as possible (excluding food and water). I cut 10 feet off my rope to hang my food bag. I threw out a small hard case that held my credit cards, drivers license and insurance cards. Also tossed were extra Ziplock bags and I reduced the size of two rolls of medical tape.

Today's task was to climb Mount Moosilauke with an elevation about 4,800 feet. It was a long uphill climb but I moved fairly well on fresh legs. When I reached the summit I found myself in a cold and windy environment. There were no views to be had so I took a picture at the summit and a small video. I was at the summit for roughly 10 minutes and then moved on to the nearest shelter.
When I arrived at the shelter I was the only one there. It was just after 2:00 PM. I reviewed the guide and the next shelter was nine more miles. Your average miles while in the Whites is cut in half for most hikers and I'd not be the exception. The miles are tougher. An average of one to one and a quarter per hour can be reasonably expected. And so nine more miles wasn't going to happen and I had a short day of hiking due to the late start because of morning rain. I changed clothes and took a nap until another hiker arrived around 4:30 pm. Slow and steady is good enough in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602695,"Although yesterday was a short day of hiking, it did take me over a 4,800 feet peak from nearly the very bottom. I was now officially within the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the terrain was only going to get tougher.
This morning, the decent from Mount Moosilauke lived up to its reputation. It was steep, rocky, and even had foot and hand holds made of rebar and hard wood. I was glad to be getting this out of the way early in the day. And it took me down to a parking lot where I'd be sure to see other hikers and local residents. Most of the decent followed a river which provided great scenery to many small water falls. Once I arrived at the bottom I came across some trail magic from a hiker named 'Stiches'. She'd been named so for a nasty fall while hiking a few years ago that required stiches. Today she sat comfortably in the van and was giving out cupcakes and I had two. She was also full of knowledge about the AT in this area and answered any questions we hikers had. I asked about a good resupply point and was told Crawford Notch.
One of my main concerns about being in the White Mountains is the lack of accessibility to the real world while in them. This goes for having access to food and being prepared for adverse weather conditions since I'd be in high elevation for awhile. For example, last night was chilly and I'd wore most of my clothes while in my sleeping bag. I just hope it doesn't get much colder while I'm in the Whites.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602696,"The temperature was chilly last night and once again I had to layer up my clothing to stay warm. Today I'd be passing by the first hut in the White Mountains. Huts are places where you can stay for a hefty price, around $140 per night. Included in the price is a family style dinner and breakfast. They are sold out way in advance and used primarily by vacationers. But, anyone is free to stop by and as you'll see, they are good spots for hikers like myself.
It was more of the same tough terrain that the Whites are known for. I was beginning to accept the fact that my daily mileage would be cut in half while in the Whites. This was the case for all of us and it felt good not being alone in this regard. When I arrived at the first hut named Lonesome Lake it was like a cabin in the woods but nicer from the outside. The huts are staffed by three to five young adults, mostly college aged. They stay in the huts for up to two weeks before hiking out for a day off. Well, I strolled in and asked about the benefits to through-hikers like myself. We can access the rest rooms, get safe water, buy limited food, and sometimes help ourselves to free leftovers the paying guests did not eat. One reason for free leftovers is the staff would have to pack it out of the mountains. Well, this morning I was able to get some cold lasagna, chicken, oatmeal and sausage. I only took a cereal bowl sized portion but it was great. I filled up my water bottles and went on my way.
It was more of the same tough terrain today and I was only moving about one mile an hour most of the time. I hiked up and over Mount Kinsman then there was a long uphill to the campsite I was aiming for. When I arrived I found the caretaker to check in. In New Hampshire the campsites and shelters require a fee to stay. Liberty Spring was campsites only and it was $10. Each time after that would be only $5 and I was given an orange card to prove I paid the $10. I asked for a dirt spot rather than an elevated wooden tent pad. My tent is designed for the ground. I was given a spot at the edge of the campsite. I was basically all by myself in the woods on the side of a mountain. Cool, actually.

I completed the rest of the climb from the campsite to the peak of Little Haystack Mountain, about another 1,000 feet. For the next two miles I was above the tree line and it was a nice clear day. For the first time the beauty of the White Mountains hit me! Walking on the ridge line with full views all around made every ounce of effort needed to get here totally worth it. I can say without a doubt that these views I'm starting to see far surpass those of the south. Seeing mountains behind mountains behind mountains is awesome. Especially knowing I've hiked through them in one direction and will be going through them ahead. I found myself taking extra long breaks just to soak it in and confirm that, yes, I'm here at this moment in a place I've never been and may never return to. The adventure was really sweet today!
The views came with a price though. I'd spent loads of energy to reach the ridge line and it was taking its toll on my body. I've been out here hiking for about five months. When I finally decided to depart from the ridge line the decent was as tough as it gets. It was .6 miles nearly straight down wet terrain to the campsite where I was planning to only take a break and eat a late lunch. However, once at the campsite I reviewed the guide book and learned the shelter that was two miles further was off the main trail by an additional mile. And that would add an extra two miles in the roundtrip to my hike. In this terrain it wasn't worth it and I called it a day and took an extra long rest. I didn't necessarily feel good about my decision until five other hikers I'm familiar with showed up for the same reasons. There is comfort in shared misery along the trail. Misery is a harsh word, but it fits well on days like today. Tomorrow's terrain looks a bit more promising. I'll have to wait and see what's over the next mountain.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602704,"Today the adventure was going to take me past two huts. And I was aiming for a campsite about 15 miles away. It would be my longest mileage day in the White Mountains but there was talk of an easy five mile stretch of trail just before the destination campsite.
The Galehead Hut was just under three miles away and would make a great place to take a break. It was also downhill from the campsite but that means nothing here in the Whites. Sometimes the decents are tougher than climbs. Your knees are absorbing the force of stepping down with the weight of a pack on your back. Do this for an hour or longer and you can imagine the stress our bodies are going through. Some of the steps require dropping down and that's even more force the knees are absorbing. Nonetheless, I made the first hut and a few hikers were already there. I was entitled to a free bowl of soup and two baked goods as a paying customer at my first campsite. I had a bowl of mushroom soup and two pieces of a sweet cornbread with shaved coconut. Both were delicious!
I was surprised when hiker Red Bard came walking around a corner. I'd not seen him since the morning I arrived in Dalton, Massachusetts. It was good to see him and I'm happy to report he's doing well. I left the hut and climbed South Twin Mountain and Mount Guyot, both having nice views. At the second hut, Zealand Falls, I stopped in and had two slices of fresh baked herb bread and four pieces of chocolate cake, total cost $10. Shortly after leaving this hut I arrived at the five mile stretch that was supposed to be easy. And easy it was! I was now moving at about three miles an hour and reached the destination campsite in no time at all. This ended up being the easiest five miles in all of New Hampshire.

He'd told me there was a place with an all-you-can-eat breakfast but we'd have to get moving early in the morning. I said I was in! A bit of background on Red Bard. He's from Canada, speaks French and English, and can play six different musical instruments. He's possibly the most well-rounded individual I've met on the trail and it is always great to hike with him. Now on to our magical day.
The plan was simple. Hike three miles to Crawford Notch, US 302. Catch a hitch four miles to the buffet. Catch another hitch to our resupply point. Catch a third hitch back to the trailhead and resume hiking. Upon leaving the campsite, we saw a moose across Ethan Pond. When we reached the parking lot at US 302 we found a familiar face, Stitches. She was doing trail magic and I had four cookies and an iced tea. After a small chat we began our hitchhiking attempt. Two other hikers gave up after 15 minutes and resumed hiking. After half an hour we were just about to begin walking when a couple pulled over and offered a ride, we accepted. We were at the AMC Highland Center for the buffet by 9:00 AM. I had three full plates of food and lots of coffee. The food was awesome!
Hiker 'Oklahoma' joined us for step two, hitch to the resupply point, which had an outfitter across the street. He needed new trekking poles. Initially our attempts to hitch a ride were fruitless. Hitchhiking is all about giving the driver a reason to stop. Remember, we are stinky and dirty and carrying big packs. My idea for a gimmick was to do pushups as the vehicles passed while the other two held out their thumb. It worked! The first vehicle stopped. Turns out the driver is a conductor on the cog railway to the top of Mount Washington. We did our resupply at a small gas station/general store and Oklahoma bought his new trekking poles. Now on to step three.
We crossed the street and positioned ourselves for passing vehicles. Then I noticed a guy from the gas station parking lot was positioning himself to cross the street when traffic cleared. Once clear, he approached and offered us a ride but said he and his wife were in separate cars. No problem I said. She took Oklahoma back to the AMC Highland Center where he planned to spend the night and he took Red Bard and I back to the trailhead. We were ecstatic as it was only 12:30 PM. Back to hiking we went. And it gets even better.
We hiked up Mount Webster and a bit more to Mount Jackson, totaling over 3,000 feet. We were so busy catching up on stories since last seeing each other near Dalton that the climb seemed to take no time at all. Before we knew it, we'd gone six miles since resuming hiking and were at the hut around 4:45 PM. We were expecting to be there about 6:00. We asked for work-for-stay and we got it! Work-for-stay goes like this. Two to three hikers do small chores to eat leftover foods when the guests are done with dinner. Then you get to sleep on the eating area's floor overnight. We cleaned and straighten-up the library while the guests ate and then we washed dishes after dinner. We had couscous, a rice dish and desert. We filled our bellies for sure! And that is the hitch'hiker's guide to a perfect day. Thanks to all those that gave us rides today making this adventure day possible. For book followers, mile 1,851.9 page 190.","Ethan Pond Campsite

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602722,"This morning there was a buzz in the air. Today I'd finally reach the summit of Mount Washington. This mountain holds the record for highest recorded wind speed in the 20th century that does not include a tropical cyclone. There are signs warning you to turn back in inclement weather as many have lost their lives on this mountain. Lucky for me it was a beautiful day.
It was Red Bard's birthday today and he was doing morning chores for leftover breakfast. I was so excited that I opted to hike on after eating from my food bag. I couldn't handle sitting around while the hut guests ate. When the hike began Mount Washington was in the clear. About every half hour or so I'd stop and take pictures and a small video. The views this morning were the best yet. You'd stop and admire a view, hike 100 yards, and the view would be different but just as spectacular. On the way I stopped at the Lake of the Clouds hut and had coffee and two baked goods. At this point the summit of Mount Washington was only 1.5 miles away. The excitement was really intense now. My initial fears of being in the Whites with limited options had all passed. I was about to summit the crown jewel!
When I was about half a mile from the summit a cloud front rolled in and put the peak out of site. It was still an awesome feeling when I reached the summit and saw the sign. I was so happy I was offering to everyone to take their pictures so all could be in the photo. Eventually I found the visitor center and made my way in. There I saw familiar faces and sat with another hiker while enjoying a bowl of chili and a hot dog. There is a cog railway train that takes passengers to the summit. Perhaps today the conductor is the same one that gave us a ride in his vehicle yesterday. I spent about two hours at the summit hoping the clouds would clear but no such luck. It was time to move on. By now Red Bard had arrived and we resumed hiking together.
We crossed over the cog railway tracks in the fog of the clouds. Later, when we decended below cloud level, we were able to see the train moving down Mount Washington. We crossed over Mount Clay and Mount Jefferson which are included with Mount Washington in what's called the Presidential Range. The views leading away from Mount Washington were as awesome as they were on the way to it. Today was an entire day of beauty. I took probably ten times the photos I'd taken on any other day of this adventure. At times I wished this day would never end. But sadly, I reached the destination hut where Red Bard was given work-for-stay and I was declined as they filled their quota. I hiked another .6 miles to camp below the tree line on the side of a mountain in King Ravine. It was no easy .6 either. The winds howled above all night but I did get a good night's sleep while I unwound from a magical day. Rain was in the forecast for tomorrow and caused me some concern.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602745,"The winds did howl all night but at 6:45 AM when I was ready to leave the comforts of my tent it had yet to start raining. I was glad for this as it meant I could pack up my gear in a dry state. When I hiked the .6 miles uphill back to the hut, I was met with the hut being engulfed in clouds, but not rain.
I refilled my water bottles and ate my own food for breakfast in the coziness of the hut. I knew rain was coming, it was just a matter of time. And so I started the climb to go over Mount Madison. The climb was about 500 feet. As I moved higher and higher the winds increased. At times they blew me sideways and once I even lost my balance and fell slightly into a large rock. It was large enough to support me like a wall rather than my toppling over it. I stopped short of the summit to take a video, hiding behind a huge rock about six feet high. Not knowing what to expect, I made my move to the summit. I was taken by surprise at the strength of the winds by moving just 15 to 20 feet higher. These were the strongest winds I've ever experienced. And yet, I was as happy as ever! I wasn't afraid but knew the dangers so I enjoyed the moment long enough to take a short video, a couple photos of myself, then quickly moved off the summit. After soaking it in I moved down the other side and the winds started to decline but were still strong. As I made my way to the tree line the rains came and I was soaked in no time at all. I later heard that those hikers just behind me were caught in sleet and hail near the summit. All made it through safely though.
It was a long decent in steep, wet trail. I slipped multiple times including one that plunged my right knee into a rock. Luckily nothing cracked or broke. There was a prize at the bottom of the mountain in Pinkham Notch, another AMC Visitor Center. By the time I arrived the rain had stopped and the clouds were beginning to clear. I had lunch of a vegetarian chili and sandwich while listening to all the hikers talk about their summit experiences. Soon it was as sunny as ever and many hikers pressed on. Red Bard came in and said the experience, he was caught in the worst of it, had pushed him to the limits of his comfort zone. Both he and I had enough adventure for the day and decided to hitch a ride to dry out at a hostel in Gorham, New Hampshire. Three other hikers joined us on the side of the road and it wasn't long before a gentleman stopped and took all five of us to town. He had a vehicle that he said would hold seven, I forget the make and model. It turns out he was originally from Canada and he and Red Bard were engaged in conversation in French.
At the hostel we showered, they did our laundry, and shuttled us to Wal-Mart and a beer store. Red Bard and I split a six-pack of beer. At the hostel one of the hikers made chicken parmesan for dinner and we shared in the meal. The rain would be gone the following day and we planned to return to hiking.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602746,"This morning at the hostel we awoke to two great things every hiker loves, good hiking weather and all you can eat pancakes. Two hikers that were doing work-for-stay were in charge of making pancakes as fast as they could for all the hikers. I ate a total of five pancakes and had a couple cups of coffee. The shuttle returning us to Pinkham Notch left the hostel at about 7:10 AM.
I've mentioned this before. Every time we hike the impossibly tough section, yet another one is talked about. Today we were up against the Wildcats. They are a series of four mountain peaks, each higher in elevation than the previous. Now I'd just completed the tough White Mountains of New Hampshire and enjoyed it tremendously. But the hyped-up Wildcats were next, right from leaving Pinkham Notch. It wasn't long before we found ourselves overlooking a long decent to the last hut in New Hampshire, Cater Notch hut. The decent was roughly 1,000 feet in less than a mile. Once at the hut I looked at the guide book and was surprised. So I played a trick on Red Bard by asking him to tell me if the following statement was true or false. ""We're done with the Wildcats."" We saw a large climb facing us whenever we decided to leave the hut. Therefore, he answered false. Truth is we were done with the Wildcats. Red Bard wants to start a petition to change them to the Housecats. They weren't tough at all!
When we left the hut we made quick work of the climb to Carter Dome as well. Our confidence is sky high now having made it past the Whites. Our hiking is more fun too, we've survived the worst terrain thrown at us. Between talking and hiking with a chip on our shoulder we arrived at the Imp Campsite without realizing we'd gone 13.1 miles. When we checked in with the caretaker she offered us food as she was hiking out the following day and didn't want to carry the extra weight. I snatched three protein bars, a small trail mix and half a block of guda cheese. It is getting darker sooner and there's been a cold spell lately. After setting up my camp I forgoed the hot meal and had a cold dinner so I could get into my tent and sleeping bag as quickly as possible.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602752,"It was very cold this morning when a was breaking down my campsite. I was shivering my way through a cold breakfast while talking with some local hikers and telling them my story. The beat thing to do was to get the blood flowing by hiking. It didn't take long before I was peeling off layers of clothing. It was good to be back on the trail again.
Today was a little strange in that Red Bard and I wanted to have a good mileage day but camping options were either too short or to long. We decided to just hike until the 5 o'clock hour and then start looking for a stealth campsite. By definition, a stealth campsite isn't visible from the trail. There's a whole process of not camping within a certain distance of a road, within so many yards of the trail and making your campsite appear as if no one was ever there. But the reality is that stealth campsites are those that are not listed in guide books as an official site, but it is clearly visible as a spot used often. Meaning the forest floor's vegetation has already been severely impacted. You'll find these spots near rivers, ponds, lakes, valleys and near mountain tops. Hikers like these spots for access to water or for their scenic views.
Today's hike included one large decent and a large climb. The rest was mostly small ups and downs. It was close to 5:00 PM when Red Bard decided to take a small break and I pressed on forward. As luck would have it I came to the official Trident Col Campsite shortly after 5:00 PM. Being surprised, I took out the guide book and it was clearly listed at mile 1,899.5. Not sure how I didn't see it before, but the timing was right and when Red Bard caught up to me I said I'd found our home for the night.
It was a nice site with a privy and a bear box for overnight food storage. We had ample time to setup camp and make nice hot meals. I had a Knorr rice side with bacon bits added in. When I finally did get into my tent and log the day's activity, that's when I realized we were a half mile short of 1,900 adventure miles. That's fine though as we'd be there first thing in the morning. Red Bard was the first to see the view in the attached photo the following morning. It was an awesome view and with Maine being about 10 miles away, a fitting farewell to the great state of New Hampshire which gave me nothing but magical views day in and day out.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602755,"I'd like to begin by telling you how great today was going to be. But some things just can't be put into words. So I'll just blurt it out... I've reached the state of Maine!
Knowing I'm in the last state of 14 on the adventure is a great feeling. And to know today is September 9th and if the weather cooperates I'll be done before October arrives is also great. I can start counting the days until I return home to see family and friends.
Maine said hello with magical views of its own as I climbed and summitted Goose Eye Mountain. The view was a full 360 degrees. Let me tell you, these views never get old. Mountains behind mountains behind even more mountains. As we hiked across the lower peaks on the mountain we came across areas of mud. At one point my right foot sunk down above the ankle in mud as I tried to avoid a huge circle of mud. I quickly retreated and chose another route and managed to use small trees to my advantage to avoid another incident. Later I talked with a hiker that had one leg in mud up to his knee. And there was another spot that had two planks across it but the planks sank as soon as you stepped on them. There was no way around it and this trap got the best of all of us. It didn't matter that you knew it was coming, they sank too fast to avoid wet shoes.
I've met a new hiker returning to the trail in this area from where he stopped last year. His trail name is 'OK'. I was surprised when he said he heard of Sheffield Lake, my home town. It turns out he is from Medina, Ohio, living not far from my sister Barb.
Completing 14.5 more adventure miles was nice. And yet here we go again with the just wait until, etc. Tomorrow I'll be going through a section of trail in Maine known as the Mahoosuc Notch. It is supposedly the toughest continuous mile on the entire Appalachian Trail. We'll see about that, won't we?! For book followers, mile 1,914.0 page 200.","Trident Col Campsite

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603187,"On today's agenda was a mile of trail called the Mahoosuc Notch. It is known as the toughest continuous mile on the Appalachian Trail. There was also a threat of rain which would add to the difficulty. I was up and moving early in hopes of getting through the Mahoosuc Notch before the rain arrived.
I went through the toughest mile with Red Bard. When we arrived at the Mahoosuc Notch this is a description of what we found. Imagine folding a sheet of paper in half and standing it on the fold to make a vertical v-shaped corridor with steep walls. Then imagine filling the corridor (bottom) with a bunch of large irregular sugar cubes. There you have a description of the Mahoosuc Notch. The closest thing I've seen to this in real life, minus the two mountain sides, is a break wall on Lake Erie.
In essence, I've been unknowingly training for the Mahoosuc Notch most of my life having fished from break walls for so many years. I've navigated these dangerous break walls carrying fishing gear. Red Bard and I started moving through the notch after starting a stop watch. We'd heard it took anywhere from one to four hours to traverse the notch. It was fun for us and we treated it like a jungle gym. Red Bard actually climbed through a couple tunnels needing to remove his pack. I chose to go up and over the top in these parts. I never took off my pack within the entire notch. Hoping from rock to rock was natural to me due to my experience with break walls. We were through the toughest mile in one hour and eight minutes. Next up was the Mahoosuc Arm, about an 1,800 feet climb out of the notch. This was actually tougher. There were many steep areas which were semi-smooth slabs of continuous rock. We made quick work of that as well. Had there been rain and the slabs wet it would have been more dangerous.
The rain never did come while we hiked today. In the early afternoon we hitched a ride into the small town of Bethel to resupply our food and check on some cold weather clothing. We decided to spend the night at the Chapman Inn as rain was definitely coming in the evening and we didn't want to hitch back to the trailhead and hike to a shelter in the rain. It was a good call as it did rain in the evening and most of the night. I'd made it through another day of adventure having hiked for the 12th consecutive day, most of those days in the tough White Mountains of New Hampshire. I'd earned the well needed rest the Chapman Inn would provide. For book followers, mile 1,923.7 page 200.","Full Goose Shelter and Campsite

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603189,"Rain stayed in the area for more than a day so I decided to take a day off yesterday. The Chapman Inn was a great place to stay. It was operated like a bed and breakfast. There was a total of six guests the first night and only four last night. Those numbers included Red Bard and I.
I took an Uber back to the trailhead at Grafton Notch and arrived at approximately 10:30 AM. Today's hike took me over the east and west peaks of Baldpate Mountain. The elevations of the peaks were just shy of 4,000 feet. The terrain was tougher today but nothing worse than I'd seen before.
I tented at a campsite near a river and road. The weather was nice and there was no chance of rain. Red Bard made a campfire. This was the first campfire I'd been a part of in months. It was a nice change. I ate my dinner while sitting near the fire.
For the most part, today was just another day on the adventure, although the views in Maine are as breathtaking as those of New Hampshire. Nothing special happened, but one can't ask for every day to be magical. If all days were magical, then in reality they'd all be routine.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603191,"It is a little extra work to break camp when tenting verses sleeping in a shelter. Sometimes the extra work is needed. Lately I've found myself ready to call it a day without a shelter in the area. As long as it is not raining, I'm fine with tenting. I've found I sleep better in my tent and there's little chance of bugs pestering me overnight.
Today was a day that I stopped hiking in the early afternoon. After stopping to take a break at a campsite, Red Bard and I were spent and decided to make this campsite an overnight stay. We were joined by three additional hikers, Robinhood, Bugs and Jingle. Jingle shared his freeze dried ice cream that he received in a care package from his wife. It was cookies and cream and really sweet. A small taste was all I needed. We also enjoyed another campfire complements of Red Bard.
While on the trail today I had the pleasure of meeting a hiker named Pappy. He was going southbound. He held the record for oldest person to ever through-hike the Appalachian Trail. Not sure of his age at that time. However, his record was broken by another individual and Pappy decided he'd have no part of that. And so here he was at the young age of 87 attempting to reclaim his title. Yes, that's right, he's 87! I didn't want to hold him up too much but I did stop long enough to say hi and introduce myself. Pappy is a Korean War Veteran like my late father (Dad would have turned 87 on 9/21.) and to see him on the trail was inspiring. I wished him the best and moved on down the trail. I'm sure you could research more on Pappy if you felt inclined to do so.
There is something funny starting to happen on the trail now. With the passing of each day of hiking the excitement is beginning to grow as we move deeper into Maine. The light at the end of the tunnel is now a reality and everyone is smiling more and having more fun regardless of the circumstances. Reaching Mount Katahdin is on all of our minds.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603310,"The terrain in Maine is getting better and better with the passing of each day. And by better I mean easier. The toughness of New Hampshire carries over into Maine for the first 100 miles or so. Then its said we will be on the home stretch to Mount Katahdin. Ah, how I've longed for easier trail.
Today I climbed Old Blue Mountain and then Bemis Mountain. Neither was too tough, both did not exceed 4,000 feet in elevation, but the views atop each were wonderful. Maine is a beautiful state just like New Hampshire. Once I was over the mountains for the day it was a relatively easy stretch of trail to the destination shelter. I was tired from the two mountains. But this was because my body has been pushed too hard, too long. After a long lunch break my second wind kicked-in and I was moving faster than I've moved in weeks. Coming down Bemis Mountain was an elevation drop of approximately 1,500 feet.
Here I was moving quick and the humidity was high and the temperature above normal for the time of year. In moving quick I was neglecting my water intake. Near the bottom of the descent I crossed a hiker going south. He said not that far ahead near the road was a cooler with some trail magic. From this point forward I was on a mission to open the cooler as fast as possible. I was hoping for some cold water. Water I'd not have to filter. When I opened the cooler I chose an option I've never chosen before during hiking and to this point reserved for town. There was one ice cold Coors and I wanted the carbonation in a bad way. The beer went down in three large gulps and it was very refreshing. I also indulged in about a dozen cherry tomatoes and a fig bar. These items made my day.
I pressed onward and made the shelter about 6:45 PM. It was a great day of hiking as I hiked 17 miles. It has been nearly a month since I've put in a day of mileage this high.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603312,"The small town of Rangeley was in my path today. The goal was to hike about nine miles then hitch a ride into town for a resupply of trail foods. And of course while in town take advantage and get some real food for lunch.
The nine miles to town were mostly a drop in elevation and Red Bard and I made quick work of the mileage. We took a small break at the trailhead and then setup to hitch another nine miles to town. While we were working the hitch another three hikers came out of the woods and joined us. Within 15 minutes we had a hitch that took all five of us into town. It was an extended cab pick-up and we squeezed in while putting five packs into the bed of the truck. It was lunch time and we'd heard good things about Sarge's Pub, a sports bar. The pub became our first stop in the small town.
I ordered the super loaded nachos, others opted for burgers and sandwiches. I partnered the nachos with a couple pints of a local beer. Those beers sure went down fast! I'd be wiser next time to consume water when coming off the trail before drinking two beers. But the excitement of town got the best of me. It always does.
We hung around Sarge's after eating to use their electricity to charge our phones, etc. Then we walked about a mile to the local supermarket for a resupply. Off to the side of the supermarket was a small hill. Here there was about eight hikers lounging in the grass. We took turns doing our resupply while leaving our packs on the hillside for others to keep an eye on. I'd say we spent a couple hours sitting on the hillside before returning to the trail. Red Bard and I hitched our way back to the trail. It was an odd hitch. The gentleman was unaware of hikers coming all the way from Georgia on foot. His mind was blown and he took a group photo to remember the day. There were two other hikers in the truck already when we got in. I'd seen these two before. It was in Virginia at the Angel's Rest Hostel. They were there doing work-for-stay and were removing a raised bed in excruciating heat. They'd flipped up north to Mount Katahdin and were now heading south. It is common for hikers to flip up north if they feel they can't make Mount Katahdin before bad weather arrives, around mid-October.
Red Bard and I only hiked another couple mikes to the first shelter. With packs full of food from the resupply and bellies full of town treats, it was all we could muster.

After nearly 2,000 miles and getting through the tough White Mountains of New Hampshire we've basically seen it all. The Saddlebacks were the next just wait but we were not to be phased.
The Saddleback Mountains were a series of three peaks with the first two just over 4,000 feet. We climbed over the peaks with the highest one coming first. After the three peaks we descended back down to about 1,500 feet. And once again the difficulty of the climbs did not live up to the hype. We waited for the difficulty to wipe us out but it didn't happen. Nope, we're experienced hikers these days. The views from atop the three were great though. And, after putting the Saddlebacks in our rearview mirror, we have just a few more mountains of similar elevation to climb before we reach a long, low elevation stretch of trail leading to Mount Katahdin.
From atop one of the mountains I had a cell signal and returned a call from my brother Robert. Everyone is wondering when I'll be home. I'd originally planned on a mid-September finish date. However, that date was too optimistic given that I underestimated the White Mountains in New Hampshire. It's looking more like October 1st now. Plus I may take a couple days hanging out in Maine before returning home. During the call I talked to my great niece Harper. She's only five years old. She's missing the play time we share when I visit. So am I. I told here I'll be home soon and we'll have a party.

Today we were a group of four hikers. Red Bard and I were joined by Bugs and Robinhood. The plan was to hike 13.5 miles and then hitch to the small town of Stratton, ME. We were thinking of splitting a room four ways. I was the first of us to reach the trailhead. Once we were all there we setup for the hitch and were joined by a fifth hiker. A gentleman with a small truck with a cab pulled into the trailhead. When he said he'd give us a ride I approached his truck only to see it packed with the tools of trade of a painter. I said I don't think this is going to work. He said we'll do whatever it takes and starts unloading tools and ladders into the weeds. Next thing I know I'm helping him unload and we make room for four. I agreed to stay behind to guard the equipment. I'd get a ride upon his return. While I waited another gentleman stopped and offered me a ride for which I had to refuse since I was guarding the equipment. When my ride came we loaded the truck and the driver turned around in the lot. But before we could leave, two more hikers came out of the woods and we emptied the truck yet again to make room for the two. Yes, people go the distance for us hikers.
Upon reaching town I found my group and we discussed the plan. Red Bard said a gentleman approached him and offered us to stay at his house, no charge. We discussed and called the guy to accept his offer. Turns out it was the same guy who offered me a ride while I guarded the first gentleman's equipment. His name was Tom and he gave us some simple rules as we drove to his house. Some of which indicated he had a sense of humor. We couldn't stay more than 30 days, we had to shower, wash all our clothes (he had loaner clothes), eat whatever we wanted in the house, drink responsibly, and don't drink his scotch!
For dinner we each had our own full Maine lobster, grilled steak, grilled cheesy red potatoes, two ears each of sweet corn, and broccoli/cauliflower mix. He opened two bottles of wine and there was beer and he did later share his scotch with Red Bard and I. For dessert we had six choices of ice cream and made sundaes complete with chocolate syrup, whipped cream and nuts. We all stuffed ourselves and there were leftovers. None of this is exaggerated! Tom and the time spent with him were simply amazing!
A little background on Tom. He's retired from the Coast Guard having served 32 years. He entertains 30 to 80 hikers a year. During dinner and the evening, he asked us each questions showing genuine interest in all of us. He said he liked listening to our AT stories over dinner. He is the one who congratulated us with a toast for reaching 2,000 miles. In the day's excitement we'd forgotten. He even walked us through step-by-step on how to remove all the meat from the lobsters. This was the first time I'd done that. I ate more lobster today than I'd previously eaten my entire life.
Before bed, we each had our own bed, he said we were free to sleep in as long as we wanted. Coffee would be ready at 5:30 AM and breakfast at 9:00. Just wait (ha ha) until you read tomorrow's entry that talks about breakfast. For book followers, mile 2,002.7 page 206.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

I'd stayed up late the night before watching the NFL game. I was rooting for Chicago and happy to see they won. The other three hikers had called it a night and it gave Tom and I a chance to chat alone. He was surprised to learn I was 50 years old.
Even with staying up late I awoke around 6:00 AM. It wasn't until about 30 minutes later I rolled out of bed and headed upstairs. The coffee was ready like Tom had promised. He was making jokes about my not being able to sleep in. And despite two beers, a glass of wine and a scotch on the rocks the night before, I felt fine. Tom was working on breakfast and I my journal while sipping coffee. As the other hikers came out of their rooms, Tom took their made to order eggs preference. Of course I skipped the eggs and he was fine with this. When he called us to the breakfast table, the table was loaded. There were blueberry waffles, sausage links, hash browns, bread for toast, yogurts, fruits, orange juice and he brought eggs to my hiker buddies. Oh, I can't forget to mention the Vermont syrup. None of that cheap stuff we usually buy back home. He didn't join us for breakfast. He was busy doing chores as he was expecting five more hikers this evening.
For breakfast I had four blueberry waffles (big ones!), seven sausage links, two servings of hash browns and lots of coffee. I used a fair amount of the Vermont syrup too. What a breakfast! He asked what time we'd like to head back to the trail and we said 10:30 AM. Until then all us hikers relaxed and did little things in preparing to hike again. As Tom drove us back to the trail he said if we have any problems from here to Mount Katahdin to call him. He'd either come get us personally or make sure we were taken care of. Although I'd only known Tom for less than a day, I was sad to say farewell. You don't meet people like this too often and it'd be great to have his friendship in life. Thanks so much Tom for giving us hikers a wonderful experience we'll cherish the rest of our lives. Keep up with the trail magic with future hikers my friend. Best wishes to you and your four-legged friends.
Tom left the trailhead with another hiker that just came out of the woods. That hiker had no idea what was in store for him. We returned to hiking and we only went five miles. It was uphill with a full resupply and I was overflowing with breakfast. For book followers, mile 2,007.8, page 206.","ME 27, Stratton, ME

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603801,"Today I hiked over the Bigelow Mountains. These would be the last of the 4,000 feet peaks until reaching Mount Katahdin. Maine was getting easier by the day and our moods were showing it.
The group I've been hiking with is called a 'tramily' on the trail. The word comes from combining the two words trail and family. In a tramily you watch out for each other. A tramily can last a short time or a long time. I've seen some that were formed in week one and are still going strong. Having put the big mountains behind us we were in a playful mood. When we came upon East Flagstaff Lake we took some time to enjoy the shoreline. I tought my friends how to skip rocks like we do in Ohio at Lake Erie. Red Bard seemed to enjoy the challenge of the game. I wandered the shoreline since it reminded me of home. At one point I searched for two pieces of driftwood to make a set of moose antlers for a funny photo. We played around for about an hour before resuming hiking.
At the shelter while having dinner I was making a tortilla wrap with cheese and pepperoni. The temperature is cool enough to pack these items. If you recall, Red Bard can play six musical instruments. When I was sealing up my pouch of cheese I put the package to my mouth to suck all the excess air out before sealing it. This caused a whistling sound to come from my mouth. Red Bard said what do you call that instrument? Being quick witted and it being swiss cheese, I said with a don't you know kind of tone in my voice, ""a swissle"". We all busted out laughing! It was a fitting end to a fun-filled great day of adventure.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603803,"The adventure today included a unique situation. The Kennebec River needed to be crossed. There was no bridge and fording the river is dangerous. A hiker drowned here earlier this year attempting to swim across. We needed to be at the river by 2:00 PM to use the ferry service to cross the river. We were there by noon. A volunteer with a three person canoe awaits any hikers needing to cross. Bugz and I went across first and I sat upfront paddling away. The guy in the back controlled the direction of travel. Before long my tramily was safely across.
On the other side of the river was the small town of Caratunk. There was a package awaiting me at the small post office from my great friends. Thank you Mike and Jenny for your support of my adventure. There was so much in the care package that I shared a few items with my tramily. We hung out at a hostel and ate lunch since the post office didn't open until 2:00 PM. We'd had an early start to ensure arriving to the ferry and then sitting around for a while none of us wanted to resume hiking. We did some research and found a lodge two miles away that had a room for $100. We were going to split it four ways. When we got there by hitching I found out we were misquoted over the phone. It was $80 with the hiker discount. There was a menu at the check-in and food prices were high. So when we checked into the room with three beds I told my tramily the room was on me and they could spend there money on food and the in-house brewery. I'd spent way more on a room for just me during the adventure so it was a great time for some on-trail trail magic. Plus I liked these three and was hoping to hike to Mount Katahdin as a group. After dinner I spent time updating my journal while the other three enjoyed the outdoor hot tub. I even did our laundry so they could relax. When they came back to the room they were definitely recharged. Red Bard was happy to take the floor since there were only three beds. He slept on his sleeping pad. We needed this day of recharge because the weather forecast for the next couple of days wasn't desirable for hiking.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603806,"I had a huge breakfast at the lodge this morning. I did a double order of blueberry pancakes equating to six with eight slices of bacon and countless cups of coffee. It all went down fairly easily. I really enjoy the hiker hunger phenomenon. I can eat whatever and as much as I want and still lose weight. I burn more calories each day while hiking than I'm consuming. Unfortunately, breakfast ending up being the best part of today.
The weather was cloudy and windy when we setup to hitch back to the trailhead. We had no luck for half and hour. That's when Robinhood left on his own and starting walking back to the trail. It was at this point that it started to drizzle and the hopes of a good weather day went down the drain. Bugz went back into the lodge and persuaded them to give us a shuttle back to the trail. After a short wait we were on our way and picked-up Robinhood on the side of the road. The drizzle progressed to a light rain as we disappeared down the trail.
For most of the hiking day it rained and the temperature steadily dropped. If it were up to me I'd have taken a rest day and stayed another day at the lodge. But we moved together now as a tramily. I arrived at the shelter, changed into dry clothes, and crawled into my sleeping bag by 5:30 PM. I needed to get warm. I never left my sleeping bag until the following morning. I skipped dinner opting to remain snuggled within a warm place. Tomorrow would be another day and I was hoping for better weather. For book followers, mile 2,054.4 page 211.","US 201, Caratunk, ME

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603841,"When I awoke this morning I'd been in my cozy sleeping bag for just over 12 hours. Looking out of the shelter I could see it was not raining but it was still chilly. And the wind was really whipping the trees around. Although I'd be putting on wet clothes from the day before, once the hiking started I'd warm up. When we hit the trail I was almost hit by a falling tree branch. I never seen it come down but I did hear it. The hiker behind me said it missed me by about an inch. I took a look over my shoulder and would guess the branch was the size of a broom stick. Luck was on my side to start the day.
We had a new first today on the adventure. I had to remove my shoes and socks twice to ford two rivers. Although the current wasn't strong, the river bottom was loaded with slippery rocks. I wore my rubber camp sandles and avoided the embarrassment of falling into the water. In fact, we all made it across just fine. The sun was out all day but the winds never ceased. I didn't mind this since we were aiming for a 22 mile day to get to the town of Monson. The high winds kept it cool making for great hiking weather.
The town of Monson would be our last stop before entering a stretch of trail know as the 100 mile wilderness. I'd need to carry enough food to last the entire 100 miles. I was also looking forward to some town food and the comfort of a real bed before entering the wilderness. Three of us reached the main road leading to Monson apart five minutes apart. Robinhood didn't show up for another half hour. We now had to position ourselves for a hitch into town, about four miles.
Within 10 minutes a white SUV pulled over. Inside were four middle-aged women that were heading into town for a nice dinner. They were appropriately dressed for the occasion. Perhaps it was to have a story to tell, but they said they could squeeze the four of us into the SUV. I volunteered to get crammed into the hatchback compartment with three of our backpacks. It was not comfortable but I was happy to endure the tight quarters to get to town. They dropped us off and took a group photo of us to validate the story they'd be sure to tell their friends.
We found our way to a small restaurant and I ordered a bowl of French onion soup, a cheese steak sandwich and fries. The soup was sure to warm me up as I was now chilly wearing shorts and a t-shirt and no longer hiking. By the time we were done eating the sun had set. Lucky for us the restaurant was also a small hostel and we paid $25 for a bunk. We were all in the same room that held exactly four bunks. After taking a shower I relaxed on the couch. Next thing I know Red Bard wakes me up and says its time for bed. The long 22 mile day had worn me out and I'd fallen asleep. For book followers, mile 2,076.4 page 214.","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603843,"The adventure is down to only 114.5 miles to go. April seems so far away and yet I'm having trouble believing the end is near. Today I entered the 100 mile wilderness. This stretch of trail does not cross a frequently traveled road. Therefore, I had to resupply in Monson with enough food for six days. That was our plan, to do the 100 miles in six days. The terrain in this stretch is easy compared to what I've already been through but the extra food in my pack meant a heavy pack to start with.
For breakfast I had a Hostess apple pie and two locally made cookies. Not the best foods to eat but the calories were high. When we arrived at the trailhead Bugz realized she'd forgot her trekking poles back at the restaurant/hostel. While we waited for her to backtrack I met a gentleman in the parking lot that was wearing an Air Force hat. He retired from the Air Force and we had a small chat of our shared military service. He and his wife were hiking a small section of the trail in each of the 14 states the trail passes through.It was a long day of hiking seeing as my backpack was heavy. I didn't arrive at the shelter until 6:35 PM. Although a spot was available, I opted to setup my tent. I ate dinner and was in my tent by 7:45. I was surprised to learn I had a cell signal. With today being Sunday I spent some time catching-up on all the NFL action. Afterward I fell asleep while coming to terms with the fact I was now less than 100 miles from finishing my adventure.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603848,"Day two in the 100 mile wilderness was filled with sun but it certainly was chilly. As long as I was hiking I was fine. As soon as I'd stop to take a break the chill would begin to set in. Therefore, breaks were short but more frequent. I also crossed over the 2,100 miles of adventure milestone. But at this point the milestone is being overshadowed by the end being near.
Today I went over Barren Mountain with an elevation of 2,650 feet. With all the miles I've done this was hardly a challenge, even with more food than usual in my backpack. By the end of the day I was starting to get tired though. I've not had a full day of rest since the 11th of September. It is the price I'm choosing to pay to keep on moving toward finishing the adventure. Bad weather could roll into Maine any time now, especially atop Mount Katahdin, the northern terminus of the trail.
We chose to tent just before a river that we'd need to ford across in the morning. I setup my tent and ate dinner with my tramily. There were a few other hikers there as well. The distance between groups of hikers is starting to shorten as we move toward Mount Katahdin. In talking with these hikers, some I know, some I do not know, we are all anxious to finish. Nights are getting colder and fall foliage is progressing. Starting each day by coming out of a warm sleeping bag is getting tougher by the day. Tonight I was in my tent by 7:00 PM.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603849,"We had no idea what was in store for us when we packed-up camp and headed to the river about 50 yards away. The water wasn't that deep and at the edge didn't feel too cold. Sure, the air was cold but we expected that to be the case here in Maine in late September. We crossed without shoes and socks as any hiker would do. Red Bard was the first to cross the river and I followed shortly behind. Bugz made her way across after I had already reached the northern river bank. None of us had any feeling in our toes! It was the coldest my toes had ever been and to be honest, I was concerned. As quickly as I could, I dried my feet and put on my two pairs of socks and shoes. For about 15 minutes we walked up and down the trail without our backpacks trying to get the blood flowing into our feet. We then started hiking and not until about another 30 minutes did our feet regain their feeling. We all survived the ordeal.
There was a series of mountains to cross today. By the time we reached White Cap Mountain, the highest and fourth of four peaks, the weather was not in our favor. Red Bard and I were being blown around by winds in excess of 50 miles per hour and there was a heavy mist. The experience was worse than when I was on Mount Madison in New Hampshire. At least there I wasn't exposed for very long. We were exposed above the tree line for over 100 yards and the terrain was nothing but rocks one foot and bigger in size. I hiked with one hand holding my hat on, leaving only one hand with a trekking pole to offset the wind and balance myself among the rocks. I nearly fell a handful of times while scrambling to get into the trees on the other side of White Cap Mountain. Once in the safety of trees we stopped to take a break and relived the event. From this point forward we would not be over 2,000 feet in elevation until the final climb of Mount Katahdin. That in itself was a reward for crossing White Cap Mountain.
Rain came around 3:00 PM. It wasn't heavy and it was off and on. It was certainly enough to make tenting a miserable option. The shelter was crowded when I arrived but the residents were friendly and made space for all of us. No one wants to leave a hiker no option but to tent in cold rain. Although we experienced some unpleasantness today, we were now only 67.8 miles from the summit of Mount Katahdin. The excitement of a finish is growing.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603898,"At this point I was deep into the backwoods of Maine. The landscape is filled with remote lakes and ponds, all with crystal clear water. The fisherman in me could only think about one day returning to fish these isolated gems. Perhaps one day I shall. I've done all my hiking without listening to music or podcasts as many hikers do. Before I even started the adventure, I wanted to be disconnected from civilization as much as possible while hiking. I saved the tastes of civilization for when I visited towns. That made town visits that much more rewarding.
Today was an easy 19.5 mile stretch of trail. And I did quite a bit of hiking today by myself. The solitude gave me time to reflect on the adventure. It's still hard to believe I've hiked as many miles as I have. But as enjoyable as today was, I'm still eager to return home. Aside from the wonderful scenery today, it was a routine hiking day.

That plan included Bugz being able to pick-up a food package within the 100 mile wilderness. To do so, she'd have to take a boat ride to the establishment where her mom sent the package. When we arrived at the boat dock, Bugz was informed that only those staying the night at the isolated hostel were eligible for a boat ride. She chose to abandon the package. This resulted in our decision to do back-to-back 20+ mile days to reach Baxter State Park, home to Mount Katahdin and a camp store with food, a day early. We'd now summit on Saturday.
While hiking in the early morning we came close to a lake and decided to go off trail to view the lake. Good thing we did. When we cleared the woods and hit the rocky shoreline, the morning sun was lighting up Mount Katahdin to the left. It was simply beautiful! All the miles we've done and now to see our destination in such beauty was amazing. We all just fell silent while absorbing the view. It was really sinking in now that our dream was within reach.
Later we took lunch on another shoreline rather than a close by shelter. We'd be crazy to pass up such a place. The trail actually touched the shoreline and about six hikers went by as we took our lunch. As he's been doing since I showed him how, Red Bard was skipping rocks again. We didn't play too long and got hiking again to ensure we were on pace with our new plan. There was a climb of 700 feet in the afternoon which gave us another wonderful view of Mount Katahdin with a large blue lake in the foreground.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603902,"Today was the second half of the new plan to summit on Saturday and I woke up in the best of spirits. I'd be hiking out of the 100 mile wilderness, have a real lunch at a camp store, then hike into Baxter State Park and get my permit to summit Mount Katahdin.
I left camp this morning by myself and hiked for about two hours alone. At one point I heard a low plane overhead and went a short distance to the edge of a lake. The plane circled twice before coming to land on the water about 100 yards directly in front of me. It was awesome to see this up close. Sadly, I didn't take the time to get my phone out of my backpack and missed a great video.
Eventually I hiked out of the wilderness, reaching a road with light traffic, and waited here for Bugz as she wasn't far behind. Together we walked the road to find Robinhood standing on a bridge that spanned a river. Soon afterward Red Bard joined us and we took some photos of us and Mount Katahdin. Moving across the bridge we came to the camp store which had a small restaurant inside. For lunch I had popcorn chicken and a burger with fries. And, two beers to celebrate our progress. We all bought some trail foods for the evening and following day before heading into Baxter State Park.
The trail followed a river and was super easy terrain. At one point a large rock outcrop made a natural dam and we rested here in full sun for nearly an hour. I resisted the temptation to swim but did dunk my head in the water a few times. We still had a couple hours of hiking ahead of us and pressed on. Once we arrived at the Ranger station, we registered and paid the $10 to camp in the park at The Birches, only 5.2 miles from the summit of Mount Katahdin.

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604038,"I will be posting a final conclusion article by October 23rd.
It has been nearly six months since the adventure began back on April 6. I've chipped away at the over 2,000 miles one day at a time and finally, today was the day to summit Mount Katahdin. Red Bard used the last of his coffee to make a community pot for the tramily. Even without sugar and cream, it was great coffee. For breakfast I had a cinnamon roll and six Oreo cookies. Not the best of breakfasts but enough calories to get the job done. After breaking camp we headed to the ranger station where we left non-essentials that we wouldn't need today. Items like a sleeping bag, extra clothes, tent, etc., were left behind. It's not legal to spend the night on Mount Katahdin so we'd be hiking up the 5.2 miles, have our celebration, then hiking back down to the ranger station.
The first couple of miles were relatively flat and we moved like the wind. We were filled with eagerness like kids on Christmas morning. We passed many hikers that were there just for the day. With all the miles we've done, we were conditioned well. When the climb began it was not easy, but not very difficult either. There were large rock fields to climb and at times we had to rid ourselves of trekking poles and literally climb upwards. The sky was clear at this point and the sun was shining providing spectacular views. Every so often we'd stop to admire the scenery behind us and take some photos. The higher we climbed the more the winds picked-up. Eventually, we reached a portion of the mountain called the tableland. Here, the terrain flattened out quite a bit and was a more gradual climb of 1.5 miles to the summit. The wind was also brisk, we were now in the clouds, and it was now much colder than it was at the ranger station. I'd started in shorts and a short sleeve t-shirt, but now I was in leggins, thicker shorts, a long sleeve shirt and wearing my rain jacket.
When we reached the summit the sign was surrounded with about 30 hikers. One by one we made our way to the sign and had our moment with completing the 2,190.9 mile adventure. When I approached the sign I had with me my AT tag from Georgia and a coin from my father's coin collection. I touched these to the summit sign to signify carrying the AT tag the entire distance and to pay tribute to my late Father. We then found a spot off to the side to relax, take it all in, and have lunch. I only ate a protein bar and a snickers. After about 30 minutes we made our way back to the summit sign to take our photos. It was a feeling a can't really describe to finally be standing atop the sign on the summit of Mount Katahdin. The adventure was now complete! It began as a comment on a bus trip some years ago and now I had lived the adventure.
For most of the downward climb I was alone. It was only fitting as I was still taking in the fact that all the hard work was over and I'd be returning home soon. It wasn't until I was less than a half mile from the ranger station that tears ran from my eyes. I was the first of the four of us to reach the ranger station. One by one my tramily arrived and after we were all there we made our final plans. We took a shuttle from the ranger station to the hostel in the small town of Millinocket, Maine. It was an hour ride and it felt really strange to be leaving the back country for the final time. That evening we all went for pizza. We ordered three large pizzas but quickly realized it was not enough and ordered two more larges. We could have easily downed a sixth large.
Bugz and Robinhood left the following day and Red Bard the day after. I cried as they left not knowing if or when I'd ever see them again. Hopefully with social media we can stay in touch and perhaps one day our trails will cross paths again. I could not have asked for a better group of individuals to hike with to finish my adventure. I spent a few days in Millinocket then took a bus to Portland, Maine, and was met by my brother Robert and brother-in-law Ron. I thank them for coming to pick me up. We had a nice time in Portland before returning home. For book followers, mile 2,190.9 page 219."," The Birches Lean-tos

Dale Knautz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604843,"I’ve been home in Ohio for three weeks now and have been undergoing a slow process to acclimate back to life away from the Appalachian Trail (AT). For the most part, it has gone according to what I expected. I’ve seen most of my family at least once and that aspect of my return is fully back to normal. I still need to make a trip to Indiana to see extended family and that will be done in the upcoming weeks. A trip was made to visit my friend of 40 years that lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We had a great time celebrating my accomplishment. Mike drove me to Georgia and continuously contacted me via text to ensure I was ‘good to go’ on the trail. He also made a visit while I was wrapping-up Virginia and moving into West Virginia. Thanks Mike for all your support and ensuring I didn’t come home until I finished!

Being home feels weird. Part of me misses life on the trail. Even though I was ready to come home and leave the hiking behind, I greatly miss the people on the trail, both hikers and those supporting us hikers. The kindness I experienced along the Georgia-to-Maine route was extraordinary. The world would be a much better place if we all displayed the kindness I encountered on my adventure. Hopefully the world moves in this direction, even if it is one person at a time. I’ve joined local hiking groups and will continue to hike as part of my exercise program. I went on a hike yesterday, for the first time, with four others and it was great to get back into the woods and meet new people. When I returned home my heels were sore, a clear reminder of life on the trail.

My body has experienced more soreness since I’ve returned home than I had while on the trail. I’m no doctor, but I think since I’m not hiking 6-7 days a week that the body finally has a chance to fully recover. Going up and down stairs has not been easy even though I spent months climbing mountains with weight on my back. It’s just a different kind of up and down I guess. As the days go by, I’m getting better with stairs. Last week I climbed a ladder to clean a second story gutter on my house. It was as if I’d never been on a ladder before. I told my brother-in-law, “I’d rather be climbing a mountain,” since I was not stable on the ladder. Perhaps it is just part of being 50 years old now.

My idea of hiking the AT started on a bus trip some years ago. I will be taking the same bus trip in a couple of weeks with my friend Brian. He was on the trip when the idea sprouted. It will be nice to catch-up with him and share stories of my adventure. Maybe he’ll be energized to the point to take future hiking trips with me to visit my favorite portions of the trail. There are portions I’d love to return to with family and friends so that they can experience the trail in the way I did. Although I’ve taken and shared many pictures, seeing things in person far exceeds the pictures. I also plan to visit the trail in the future to conduct trail magic for hikers to carry on the tradition. The trail magic I experienced certainly helped me along the way and enhanced my adventure.

Where do I go from here? Well, that has yet to be determined. I have a few options I’m still considering which include deciding to stay here in Ohio or relocate. Now is the time to make this decision as I need to return to the workforce in the next few months. I have the financial resources to take the time to ensure I make solid life-decisions post-AT.

Thanks to all those that have supported my adventure through care packages, gear, reading my journal, posting on Facebook, and simply sending texts along the way. I can’t tell you how many times a so-so day was turned into a good day on the trail as I was reminded that family and friends were back home going about their daily lives while I had this awesome opportunity of hiking the AT. It was by far the best thing I’ve ever done and without your support, it would not have happened, thanks. I need to mention a special thank you to Michael Martin, a good friend and former co-worker. When I broke my molar in half on my third day of hiking and had to return home to address it, I ran into him by chance in the Atlanta airport. When I noticed him and said, “Hey Martin, is that you,” he turned around and simply said, “You giving up already?” I’ll be honest, at that point I felt as though I may have undertaken a bigger adventure than I was prepared for. But, I needed to hear what he had to say, even if it was in a joking manner (you’d need to know him). By the time the plane landed in Cleveland I knew 100% that I’d return to the trail once my tooth issue was taken care of. Thanks Michael for helping me realize the adventure wasn’t going to be easy, but it needed to go on. In the end I got‘er done and I’ll never have to ask myself, “What if…”

I challenge all of you to elevate yourself in one way or another. You don’t have to hike the AT either. There is something in your life you’ve been putting off, whether in your personal of professional life, and there is no better time to get’er done than now. You simply need to take action and put one foot in front of the other to move forward. No matter how big the task, each step forward gets you closer to the goal. Often on the trail I sang the following out loud while I hiked, which I took from a Christmas cartoon and modified to fit my adventure.

“Put one foot in front of the other.
Trust in yourself, you cannot fail!
Put one foot in front of the other.
And soon you’ll be hiking down the trail!”
