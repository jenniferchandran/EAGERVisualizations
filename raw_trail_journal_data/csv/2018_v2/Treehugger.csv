By noon I had arrived at Watauga Lake. Initially, I had planned to eat lunch at the shelter near the lake, but after hearing and reading multiple reports of bear activity near the shelter, decided to walk past the shelter. I ran into Colton, ""Dad"", along the trail near the shelter, and we ate lunch together on the Watauga Lake Dam. Just after lunch I met a guy named ""Badger"", who was hiking south telling all hikers about a trail magic location he had set up about a mile past the dam. I arrived a few minutes later to find several large McDonald's bags on the hood of a white, Chevy Cruise, with a sign indicating that we should help ourselves. Dad had arived before me, and was just finishing his second lunch of cheeseburgers, hashbrowns, breakfast burritos, powerade, and coke. What a fantastic trail magic! Met ""Chairman"" and his girlfriend, Crystal, at the trail magic location. Hiked on, and was again caught in a late afternoon rain storm just before arriving at the shelter. Ran into ""TBD"" at the shelter, as well as a father/son team from Texas SOBO section hiking.","

Treehugger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592003,"Awoke early and hiked with Tent Cents today. Our goal today was to get as close as possible to Damascus, VA before ending the hike for the day. We walked in the rain most of the morning. We stopped for second breakfast at the Iron Mountain Shelter, where we met ""Grey Ghost"" (Maine) and his son, Brian (Colorado). Grey Ghost is thru-hiking the AT, and his son is section hiking with him for the next week or so. We stopped again at the Double Springs Gap Shelter for lunch and to dry out. We arrived at the Abingdon Shelter, just 10 miles outside Damascus, just before sunset. Tent Cents and I had the shelter to ourselves, as most folks either pushed on to Damascus, or caught a ride into Trail Days. It poured rain all night, and although the rain was super loud on the tin roof, the shelter was warm and dry.","

Tent Cents and I made our way through town, and over to the One Way Ministries building for a pancake breakfast, and feasted on about dozen pancakes and three cups of coffee each. So delicious! then we walked around tent city and the vendor booths that were set up around town. All the major trail gear vendors were on-hand helping with repairs/warranty replacements/new purchases of shoes, packs, hammocks, tents, etc. Ran into: Short Mile, Mademoiselle, and others in town. Met Tent Cents old running buddy, Bob, in town, who agreed to drive us wherever we needed to go that day. 
Damascus hostels, hotels, B&Bs, and most tenting areas were booked up, so we decided to book a hotel and get our resupply in nearby Abingdon, VA, about 15 miles west of Damascus. Abingdon is a quaint southern town with quite a few antebellum houses in its downtown area. We cleaned up, ate a great meal at the Peppermill Restaurant, resupplied at WalMart, and got a good night's sleep. A nice break from the trail.","

Bob hiked with us through town and about 4 miles north of Damascus before turning around to head back to town; unfortunately, he had to return to work the following day. We met lots of new folks along the trail today, as a large number of the hikers on the trail out of Damascus today had started the trail days ahead of us, and we caught up with them cruising through Damascus.
We experienced some Trail Magic at Feathercamp Branch, hosted by Rocket and Rockette, a husband and wife team that thru-hiked the AT last year, and were in Damascus for Trail Days to catch up with old friends, and spread some good will along the trail. Met ""Doc"", ""Great Dane"" (from Denmark). Enjoyed the scenery: rhododendrons in bloom, and walked along the Virginia Creeper Trail today where the AT and the Creeper Trail intersect.","

Rain began at 1000, just after some trail magic at a parking area near VA 600/ Elk Mountain Road sponsored by the ""Frenchman"", an artist originally from Quebec, who maintains a blog on thru-hiking. He took our picture to add to his book and drawings on thru-hikers. Rain began right after at about 10am. Entered Lewis Fork Wilderness and the Grayson Highlands. This area of the trail is gorgeous, despite the rain. Hiked with Tent Cent, and another thru-hiker named Cruise Control. The trail throughout most of the Grayson Highlands was a stream of water. Saw longhorn cattle grazing in the highlands as well as wild ponies owned by a non-profit organization, and used to graze in the highlands. Got an opportunity to pet one of the ponies, who must see hikers almost everyday; cool experience. 
Arrived at Wise Shelter for the night, but decided to push on to campsite about 3 miles north. Ran into Grey Ghost and his son Brian, and we hiked to the campsite.","

Grey Beard and Ben Comfort from Durham, NC come out to this part of VA each year to camp for a week, and provide trail magic for AT hikers. Neither has hiked the entire AT, but have done their share of hiking in other places, and really enjoy the camaraderie of sharing stories with fellow hikers. 
Met lots of new thru-hikers today: Booster and Bright (NY), Lorax, (NH), Lineus and Chazmataz (IN), Hippity-Hop-Pop and No Intention(VA), and Dupont and Phoenix (CA). Upon arriving at The Trimpi Shelter, I met Liz and David (TX), a father/daughter team SOBO section hiking. Calves, Pidge, Tent Cent, Cruise Control, and 2/3rds arrive later at the shelter. Also met Tramp, his wife, and their two dogs, as well as Mouse and her dog, Isis.

Ran into Tarzan and Whitey at the Visitors Center, who were coming off the trail to resupply. Started hiking about 1120. Met “Serotonin” at the Chatdoeld Shelter. Rained from 13-1500, making the trail super muddy through the pastures and fields. Reached the Lindamood School, a one room schoolhouse built in 1894, now part of the Settler’s Museum. The owners allow hikers to use the school building as a shelter. The local Methodist church left goodies and drinks in the school from an early afternoon trail magic. Arrived at VA 683/US11/I-81 at 1615. The Barn Restaurant (see photo) is located about a block up the road from where the trail emerges. I stopped in for their famous “1 pound hiker burger”. Great food and service. Back on the trail by 1730. Walked another few miles to the intersection of the AT and the Crawfish Trail to a campsite set back in the woods. Ran into Chairman and Crystal, both biologists from Brooklyn, thru-hiking. I hadn’t seen them since Watagua Lake. Crashed about 2100.

The inn is a renovated 1910 farmhouse owned by by former thru-hikers, Tina and her husband, Brett. Met two thru-hikers, Chinook and Ranger Z, both retired Army, starting their hike for the day as I arrived. Tina was super welcoming, and allowed me to fix my standard trail breakfast, have some coffee, refill water, and relax for about an hour.  Met a group of three hikers, Tumble, Bambi, and No Name, from northern VA, who has stayed the night, and weee leisurely beginning their day. 
Hiked on to O’Lystery Pavilion, where a Methodist church group, calling themselves the AT Outreach Ministry had set up trail magic of hamburgers, hot dogs, and other goodies. I set my tent out to dry while enjoying some great food. Met fellow hikers, E-Street (Philly), Itch and her husband Twitch (Hawaii), and Infinity and Fat Man Squeeze ( U.K.).  
Reunited with Short Mile along the trail; hadn’t seen him since Damascus. Stopped at the Chestnut Knob Shelter for the night; one of the only shelters with four walls and a door.

Sure enough, our friends from the Methodist AT Outreach Ministry has set up another feast of grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, salad, drinks, and other goodies. Really nice folks! Set up camp, took a quick, cold bath in Laurel Creek, and rinsed clothes. Then, settled in around the campfire to relax with fellow hikers: Short Mile, E-Street, Stumper (Montreal, Canada), Walk it Off (Switzerland), and Nature Boy (SC).

I resupplied on water and TP, and decided to have a second breakfast of two delicious bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and some coffee. Ate in a small outdoor picnic table seating area, and enjoyed the first real sunshine in a couple of days. 
Headed out about 1015 and paralleled and then crossed over I-77 to get back on the trail. The afternoon was a quick 13 mile walk along rolling hills until I crossed a small footbridge that put me on VA 608. I walked about half a mile up and over a hill to the Lickskillet Hostel. 
The Lickskillet Hostel is owned and operated by “Mongo”, a former thru-hiker, and is located in a former Presbyterian Church built in 1911. It features and outdoor shower, but has all the modern amenities inside: WiFi, Netflix, and super comfy beds.
