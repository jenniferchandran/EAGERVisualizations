Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582447,"Hello.  I am Rick Zinter and am planning to hike the A.T. (Appalachian Trail; 2,191 miles) starting on March 14, 2018.    Although I was hoping to title this blog with my trail name, I will have to start hiking before I am bestowed with one.

Let me start with some background about me, and why I am doing this hike.  Hiking the AT made it onto my bucket list many years ago, and I think because it sounded like a pretty cool idea, was adventurous, and a real chance to get outside.  It represents the antithesis of the sedentary lifestyle of working in an office and being tied to a desk.  Over time it became more solid with plans to hike portions of the trail with my sons, Ricky and Kyle, my daughter in law, Sarah (married to Ricky), my wife Silvia, my great nephew Ethan and possibly others.  The plan was to do this when I retired at age 66.
I have already done a couple short GA section hikes on the A.T., multiple weekend backpacking trips on the Florida Trail, once in Olympic National Park and once in
Tuck and Robin Lakes in Washington (both with my son Kyle).  I made it to Tuck Lake, Kyle did the extra up to Robin Lake.
Then in June 2015 my son Ricky was killed on a river rafting trip in western Colorado.  This event has had a profound impact on my life.  Although there has been much grief and tears, I choose to focus on the positives of what Ricky taught me and what I know he would want me to be.  I am responsible for my own happiness, and I choose to be happy.
Now, another of my reasons for this hike is to raise awareness of the KATA foundation, which stands for Kendall And Taylor Atkinson.  They were sister and brother, childhood friends of Sarah, and both died of Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disease that leads to bone marrow failure and early onset cancer.  Due to the rareness of this disease big pharmaceutical companies do not fund research.  The KATA foundation was started by Kendall and Taylor’s parents, Dr. Ken and Jeanne Atkinson, to research a cure for this disease.  In 2016, Ken Atkinson responded to a shooting in his Denver, CO neighborhood to provide medical assistance to a woman who had been shot.  The gunman turned on Ken and shot and killed him.  I cannot comprehend the grief that this family has endured.  As Sarah and Ricky were close friends of the Atkinson family, extremely involved in the KATA foundation and volunteered their time and money to support it, this hike is one small thing I can do for the Atkinson family and the KATA foundation.  I want to continue Ricky's work.
With the first 4 letters of my destination being KATA (Mt. Katahdin), which matches with the KATA foundation name, I feel it is meant for me to do this hike to increase recognition for this charity.  Please feel free to check out the KATA foundation website at www.KATAfoundation.org.
There is a donation link at their website as part of my A.T. hike, should you want to donate to this cause.
I am targeting to raise $2,191 ($1 per mile).
Also, about a year ago I saw a posting on Facebook by a friend of mine from high school, Werner.  He was going for a walk in the woods in the Spring on 2018.  Since I had already decided to retire one year earlier than originally planned, the timing was perfect.  Now we will start our hike together, and God willing, complete it together.  In reality, I am not really sure how far I will be able to go, or what possible injury could knock me off the trail.  I do know I will look for the positives in each moment and go as far as possible.",,Greenacres FL,"Jan 27, Sat",0
Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582543,"45 days until I leave for Amicalola State Park, where the A.T. approach trail starts.  That will be a flight to Atlanta on 3/13, taking the MARTA system to North Springs station, and a shuttle to Amicalola with Ron Brown's Appalachian Trail Shuttle Service.  We can sign in to start the A.T. and camp overnight at the base of the start (i.e. at the base of 600 steps up Amicalola Falls !!)
46 days until we start hiking, which will begin with 8.8 miles up to the top of Springer Mtn., the start of the A.T., and these miles won't count as A.T. miles !!!
Today is seam sealer on my tent, a Marmot Force 2P.  This will be followed in the next day or two with a waterproofing spray.  This also helps since I have to look closely at the tent, to find any holes that need repair.  Found 1 hole today and patched it.
My shelter is the Marmot Force 2P tent I mentioned above.  The extra space over a 1 person tent will allow me room for my pack and a little extra living space, plus room for Silvia, my wife, and NinaMoo, our dog, to join me for parts of the hike.
Other gear:  Osprey Aether 70L backpack, Big Agnes Lost Ranger 15F down sleeping bag, Thermarest NeoAir Trekker air mattress, REI hiking poles, JetBoil cook stove, Osprey 2.5L hydration pack, Platypus 2L gravity water filter, Black Diamond headlamp and a few other assorted items.
I have had the opportunity to test out all my gear.  I have twice done 3 day hikes on the A.T. around Springer Mtn., including the approach trail.  Also multiple weekend hikes on the Florida Trail, and twice in Washington with my son Kyle.  As for getting myself in shape, Florida is pretty flat and I will depend on low daily miles to start and get into mountain shape as I go.  I am doing a 6 mile walk each morning now, and have done several day hikes of 8-12 miles.  In early February I will do a 3 day, 40 mile, hike on the Citrus Trail in central FL.
That's all for now.",,Greenacres FL,"Jan 29, Mon",0
Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582919,"The last few days was a hike with the Loxahatchee chapter of the Florida Trail Association.  This is a well organized group with many volunteer hike leaders ... hikes and shorter walks every weekend, plus many backpacking trips.  Next week is the Ocean to Lake Trail, 6 days backpacking from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic Ocean.  I believe it is 63 miles, however I will not be able to participate as I will be volunteer working at the Honda Classic PGA golf tournament.
As for last weeks Citrus Trail hike, it was 40 miles over 3 days and 12 people all hiking their own hike.  We had clear weather, only one quick rain shower the 2nd night, and a little bit of heat to drive up the water intake ... 3.5 liters each day.  The picture is from a burn area we went through.  Some trees were still smoking although an estimate from a guy I was hiking with (a forest fire fighter from Washington) was the burn, most likely a controlled burn, was about a week old.  It was a good chance to get a good break-in on my relatively new Keen hiking boots.  I had to replace my other Keen boots as they were size 10.5 and originally large enough but now pinching my toes.  That is not good so I went up to a size 11.5.  Only 1 blister after the 3 days, so that is very manageable.  I also have a pair of Asics trail runners that I can use and my current plan is to start with the Keen boots through the Great Smoky Mountains and then switch to the Asics after that.  We will see.
Getting closer ... only 4 weeks and 2 days !!!",,Greenacres FL,"Feb 12, Mon",0
Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583053,"HI everyone !!!
Let me start out with a great big shout out to my little sister Sue ... HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!  She will be watching over me from heaven while I am on this adventure.  I will have lots of spiritual support.  Love you Sue and your kids are doing great.  Your grandson Ethan is going to join me on part of this hike.
Well, the start date keeps getting closer and I am still out every day to get ready.  I thought I might give you a few comments on the perils of training.  You see, Florida is more than pretty flat, an elevation change here is to step up on the root of a tree !!  So, although I am not getting any elevation training, I am doing my 6 mile dog walk every day.  Starting tomorrow I will do this with my backpack.
Actually, I have discovered that the morning walk is probably more dangerous than hiking the AT.  Why you ask?  Well, it is not the paved path that is occasionally broken up by a tree root, the bicycles that zoom by without warning, the other dogs out for their walks, the signs that say ""beware of alligators"", errant tennis balls or any of those type dangers of this trail.  The danger is using the crosswalk to go across Jog Rd to and from the parks I walk to.  Yeah, really.  Drivers down here are freaking atrocious.  Stop lights and crosswalks are either suggestions for the drivers, or in some cases I think they are for sport.  Today was a perfect example.  Push the button to cross the cross walk, wait for the light to flash walk, wait some more to avoid the cars running a red light, then start across the road, in the painted crosswalk path, with both eyes looking in different directions for the vehicle that views driving as an Olympic contact sport.  Almost half way across, a white pickup truck with license # (oh, I wish I had really gotten the #), accelerates through a turn crossing the crosswalk 3 feet in front of me, sees me at the last second, hits the breaks (by which time I would have already been ambulance fodder if I had not stopped), throws his arms up in the air like I should not have been there, and speeds off.  Ahhh, a typical day out for a walk.
Unfortunately, this did happen this morning, and something similar happens 2 or 3 times a week.  Fortunately, I am on to these dirty tricks and they ""aint gonna get me"" !!!
24 days to go.  Yessssss.",,Greenacres FL,"Feb 18, Sun",0
Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583524,"Hard to believe it is now only 11 days until I leave for the AT and 12 days to start hiking.  In preparation I painted a white blaze on my backpack, and the pack cover.  Why?  Well, the AT is marked by white blazes, 2 x 6 inches, on trees and rocks, fence posts etc.  If you follow the blazes, in theory, you will never be lost.  So now, anyone behind me can follow the blaze on my pack and be never lost !!!  What a great idea.  Oh wait, this assumes that I am not lost to begin with !!!  Hmmm, I guess I might have to reevaluate this.
I wanted to point out that this trail journals website has a guest book where anyone can sign in and leave me a comment.  Feel free to do this at any time ... offer up encouragement, ask questions, anything.  However, I will say if you have complaints, I think complaining, although great fun, is way overrated and I will probably ignore them.
Here is some feedback to those that have already left guest book entries:
Anna - I look forward to meeting you on the trail.  Just look for my bright green tent or the white blaze on my backpack.
Rolando, Aaron, John, Bob, John, Howard, Debbie, Connie - Thanks for your words of encouragement.
Nate - Catch you when we get to PA.
Mark - best of luck on your section hike.  Hope your friend catches the backpacking bug.
Amy - glad to hear you will be following our hike, happy anniversary on the day we start our hike, enjoy your section hikes and you WILL fulfill your dream to thru-hike.
Kim - this hike is for Evan and Becca and I sure hope to meet your two brave children fighting Fanconi anemia.
Just a follow up ... although I have been dreaming of doing an AT thru-hike for years, it is only since last summer, on the anniversary of my son's passing, that I came up with the idea of doing this hike as a way to raise awareness for the KATA foundation and Fanconi anemia.  I have never met the Atkinson family or had any experience with people affected by this disease.  I trust that Ricky is acting through me to continue the work he was doing ... and to have fun doing it.  You all have a great day.",,Greenacres FL,"Mar 02, Fri",0

I wanted to let you know about my plan for updating this journal. Although many people provide daily updates, I expect to update every 3-5 days, when in towns with good internet connection. I will be making daily notes the old fashioned way with pencil and paper, and refer to those when writing my journal.
This is also my very first post using my cell phone, as all previous posts were from my computer. Just testing out how to do this and how easy it is. If I run into difficulty the backup plan is to email my entry to my wife who will copy and past into the trail journal.

I am so proud of you and happy that another bucket list item will become for you a reality.  You are soon leaving for your A.T. adventure and you are already enjoying the journey by sharing your story with family and friends.  People have just jumped in with encouragement, ideas, offering places to stay, asking if they can walk sections with you, and others supporting you by donating to the KATA Foundation.  Mom and I offer you our daily prayers for you and Werner for health and safety and for you to be able to accomplish whatever physical, personal and spiritual goals you set up for yourself.  I look forward to reading your blog posts.

Here is what has transpired so far:
Day 2 - Hawk Mtn campsite. 8.9 miles but only 7.4 AT miles as we finished the approach trail to Springer.  My hiking partner came down sick and went off trail, hopefully we will rejoin at some point. 
Day 3 - Gooch Mtn Shelter. 8.3 miles. 
Day 4 - Jarrard Gap campsite. 10.4 miles. St Patty’s day Trail magic. Free beer at 9:30 am then later hot dogs, snacks, sodas for lunch. Great hospitality. 
Day 5 - Bull Gap campsite. 6.1 miles. Stopped at Neels Gap for lunch (pizza) and a shakedown of my gear. Only 1.5 pounds extra. Good for me !!  Then continued on. 
Day 6 - Low Gap Shelter. 10.4 miles. Day 7 - Blue Mountain Shelter. 7.3 miles

Still need the time to upload pictures which I will go back and add to most entries.
Taking a zero day tomorrow and going to a Verizon store to see about switching my service so I get better reception.  Also want to rest my body although I feel very good with no blisters, aches or pains.  Loving every moment.  Great to have the support from home and having Ricky, Kendall and Taylor as angels on my shoulder.","Blue Mtn Shelter

I crossed from Georgia into North Carolina, which means one state down and 13 to go !!!  Have stayed at the Muskrat Creek Shelter, Beech Gap tent area, Long Branch Shelter and now the Baltimore Jack Hostel (not sure I can recommend this place, but it is all part of the adventure).
The weather was been mostly cold (25-35 at night and 40-45 during the day).  Mostly overcast, drizzle, damp and who cares, I am still going on.
Currently at 109.2 total AT miles.
Been hiking lately with Dusseldorf and most of the rest of the group we were with moved ahead as they are much younger ... or so I thought until we met up in town today.  Time to go grab a beer before I get some sleep and I head out tomorrow morning ... after an all you can eat pancake breakfast.

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585394,"The last 4 days have had some wonderful sights, as well as significant elevation changes. There was Siler Bald, Wayah Bald, Wesser Bald, followed by a visit down to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center).  Then came a 5 mile up. The ups and downs have taken their toll so today was only 5.3 miles. We finally had sun, warm temps and a place to set up my tent and a quick nap under the sun. 
I have been amazed by the trees I have encountered. It is early spring and those that have fallen are slowly and peacefully assimilating back into the earth. Providing homes and sustinence to so many organisms ... moss, lichens, insects, worms, snakes and more. At the same time new trees are trying to push through the soil and older trees are just starting to bud, depending on the elevation. A truly remarkable process to watch.

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585620,"Happy belated Easter !!!
The last few days have, as always, been filled with difficult ups and downs.  I do not think the AT has seen a mountain it does not want to go over the top of ... unless there is a different taller mountain nearby that it can go over.  So far the last few days have been really good weather as I finished hiking to Fontana Dam.  The Fontana reservoir is majestic although I am sure it was disheartening to the people displaced by the dams creation back in 1947.
There are signs of Spring at the lower elevations, with small flowers, green growth and budding trees.  I do not expect that to continue as today is a zero day to rest my body, resupply and relax but tomorrow is heading into the Smoky Mountain NP.  The weather prediction is cold, snow, rain and generally not great conditions.  Also the first area to shelter/camp is about 12 miles in, and all uphill.  There is a camping area that is only 5 miles in but it is now closed due to a bear recently rampaged through it destroying tents and supplies.  I plan to hike straight through the park in 7 days so that i can hit Hot Springs NC in 10 days to meet up with my wife, dog, sister and maybe a few other family members (should I have listed my sister and family members before the dog?).
Stayed at the Fontana Village Resort last night and think I will go out to the Fontana ""Hilton"" for tonight to get an early start tomorrow.  ""Hilton"" just means this shelter with running water, electricity and showers ... the one and only shelter like this on the trail !!!

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586084,"Well, I did not make it through the Smoky Mountains.  The cold, damp, rain, sleet, and projected snow made my decision easy to get off for a couple days.  That plus my cold, and the blisters from having to break in new hiking boots.  The hiking boots I started with were all well broken in with about 80 miles on them, however they ripped across the top of the toes from a tree root (disappointing).  REI sent me overnight a new pair (great customer service) to Fontana Dam, also Keen's but a different model (the Durand) which is the same as a previous pair I have but my feet out grew.  Anyway, after one night sleeping on the floor in a semi finished room at a renovating hostel, last night in a bed at a timeshare one of my hiking partners had reserved from Australia before he started his hike, and tonight also in a bed at the same place, I will be somewhat healed and ready to go tomorrow morning.
The hike up from Fontana Dam was grueling.  Mostly uphill for 12 miles to Mollies Ridge Shelter (day 22, 11.4 miles).  As at most shelters I stay in my tent to have my own personal space and usually a little warmer and a quieter nights sleep.  Then was Derrick Knob Shelter (day 23, 12.1 miles).  Finally, to Clingmans Dome (day 24, 10.2 miles), the highest peak on the AT, where I got off and hitchhiked into Gatlinburg TN.  Little did I know that it is spring break and most every hotel and space to sleep was no vacancy.  Two zero days (day 25-26) to recover from my cold, let my feet heal up, and get a little restaurant food.
The scenery has been amazing.  I will upload a few pictures to try and give you a rough idea.  It is truly inspiring and sure helps to reinforce the beauty of nature.  I urge you all to try it --- day hikes, walks in the park, anything outdoors and away as much as possible from the ""comforts"" of home.
Tomorrow I will start hiking again, aiming for Hot Springs NC next Friday to meet up with Silvia (my wife) and NinaMoo (our dog), plus my sister Dee and a couple of her grandchildren.  Leaving from Davenport Gap at the end of the Smoky's.  This means I will have about 39 miles of the Smoky's that I have missed and plan to come back in the fall and complete.

Friday we headed into Ashville for some time with Kris O'Brien (married to my niece Lyndsay) and his sister Kari and a tour of the New Belgium brewery where Kari works.  It was fantastic.  Then a late lunch at 12 Bones Smokehouse for some excellent ribs, some groceries and then picking up Reboot who I have been hiking with for most of the past 2 weeks.  Reboot stayed with us for 2 nights at the AirB&B place we had rented.  It was on the French Broad River and also had a zip line, fire pit, trains going by daily, a great porch, and quiet !!!  Was able to put a few pennies on the train tracks and have them squished thin by the train.  Great fun.
Saturday we were in town again and my sister Dee and 2 of her grandkids (Kruz and Kennedy) arrived for the day and night.  We also saw Dusseldorf who we had not seen for the past few days.  At the outdoor market in Hot Springs we got some goats milk, and a rustic handmade wooden stool for or home in Florida.
Sunday is a rainy day and a day of rest for some of us.  Dropped Reboot on the trail as he was heading off to Erwin TN.  Hope to see him next weekend.  Also picked up Dusseldorf from the Laughing Heart Hostel and he will stay with us today and tonight before we start hiking for Erwin tomorrow morning.

When I stared this hike I violated one of the rules I have tried to live by.  That rule is to enjoy the journey, not just the destination.  I was too focused on the destination of Mt Katahdin in Maine, or at least I was thinking about the miles I would need to do each day in order to get there.
Now ... I may or may not make it to Katahdin, but I WILL enjoy the trip I am on.  This includes taking zero days to enjoy the trail towns along the way, spending the time to really talk to and listen to the people I meet along the way, taking the extra zero days in Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge to heal and in Hot Springs to be with my family and friends, to hike the miles each day I am comfortable with, to stop and smell the roses along the way and even to avoid some really bad weather if I decide to.
I am refocusing this adventure to enjoy each day and make sure I live by my beliefs.

I always prefer to stay in my tent versus in a shelter.  It is much quieter, more restful and my own little home each night.  Sleeping in the shelter can be noisy with snoring, people getting up to relieve themselves, and early risers who want to crank out the miles.  Sometimes, due to weather it is a necessary evil.  So, although I may not mention it when I say I stayed at a shelter, unless it is really bad weather, I am in my tent.Day 47 (4/29) - hiked from Mountain Harbor Hostel to the Mountaineer Shelter.  8.8 miles of a less difficult path in sunny, cool weather.  A short side trail to Jones Falls was well worth the excursion.  Beautiful.  Passed the 400 miles marker today.  Hiking with ""Notrix"".Day 48 (4/30) - stayed at the Black Bear Resort (it was a very nice hostel, but resort is a little over the top).  15.9 miles today.  Went into Hampton TN to get Subway.  I never knew Subway could taste so good.  One sub for dinner and one for tomorrows breakfast and lunch.  Shared a room with Notrix.Day 49 (5/1) - 17.7 miles to the Vandeventer Shelter.  Sunny and warm.  My biggest hiking day so far, but a little to far for me.  I prefer the 10-14 miles days but we had to get by the no camping area around Watauga Lake, due to bear activity.  A hiker I know camped just outside the restricted area and a bear still destroyed his food supply.Day 50 (5/2) - 14.4 miles to the Double Springs Shelter.  Sunny and warm ... I am really liking this weather !!!!  Great TRAIL MAGIC today from Beth and Bernie Briden, who came up from Florida to do this for about a week.  Fresh baguette, ham, cheese, mayo, mustard sandwich, ice cream, sodas, chips, snacks and so much more.  Thank you, thank you, thank you !!Day 51 (5/3) - 8.3 miles to Abington Gap Shelter.  So nice to have a short day and set up the 11 miles tomorrow in Damascus.  Starting to hike faster due to trail legs and the terrain.  Usually I go at 2 mph but was able to do over 8 miles in 3 hours today.  I even slept in and did not start hiking until 10 AM.  Warm and nice today.  Still hiking with Notrix and we will continue as long as our pace and style fits.Day 52 (5/4) - 11.0 miles into Damascus and the Broken Fiddle Hostel to resupply, laundry and shower.  I still see Soup Spot (Anna) who I first met on the approach trail, and many others.  The towns seem to be a gathering place for when you do not see them on the trail.  Stayed with Caroline, Wiki, Hank, Natty Light, Natty Daddy, and now Natty Rush (a dog they rescued and adopted) plus many others ... Grape. Glowstick, Peppermint, Strider and more.Day 53 (5/5) - a zero day in Damascus.  I was going to do a 3 hour bicycle ride down the Creeper Trail (all downhill) but the threat of rain has me in the library using their computer and ready to relax and watch a movie this afternoon.  Need to rest a sore knee and shoulder.Y'all have a great day !!!!","Erwin TN

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590058,"First, a big shout out to the 6th grade class at Phoenix Central School in Phoenix NY and their teacher Mrs. Calzada, my niece.  They are following along on my journey and sending me questions about the AT.  I am also sending them some questions back to help me identify various plants and animals along the way.
Now, let me continue with ... I HAD MY FIRST BEAR SIGHTING !!!!!
Heard a noise down the hill to my right and saw a bear scamper across the forest floor to the base of a tree.  I immediately looked around for the mother since you do not want to be between a mother and her cub.  Actually, never saw a mother and the bear was bigger than a cub.  Not sure how long mothers care for their cubs but this bear, I would guess at a year old.  A head the size of a very large dog (like a Newfoundland) and a good 100 pounds or a little more.  In any case, it sat there and stared at me while I took this picture from about 40 yards away.
This week was also a hike through the Grayson Highlands.  Wild horses (small so probably called ponies) live there and were introduced to graze the area which is enclosed by fencing.  They are gathered up yearly and given a medical checkup, then released again or some are relocated to other areas to manage the size of the heard.  Also saw cows, long horn cattle, white tailed deer, grouse, woodpeckers and the usual squirrels, chipmunks, birds, etc.
5/7, Day 55  Happy Birthday to me sister Dee.  12.3 miles to a tent site near Whitetop Mtn road.
5/8, Day 56  Hit 500 miles today !!!!  I am still surprised that I have gone this far.  Went over Mt Rogers, into the Grayson Highlands and 11.7 miles to the Wise Shelter.  Woke up the next morning with a horse grazing around my tent.
5/9, Day 57  Did 14.0 AT miles and then another 1/2 mile to stay at the Hurricane Creek Campsite.  It cost a few bucks but had restrooms and a shower ... heaven !!!  Shared the tent site with Notrix and Workhorse.
5/10, Day 58  A longer day, at least for me, but some of the easier trail the last couple days.  Did 15.9 miles to the Partnership Shelter where we ordered pizza from the phone at the Mt Rogers Visitor Center which is adjacent to the shelter.  What a treat even though it took 2 1/2 hours from initial order to delivery.  Check out my pictures for the picture of the 28 inch supreme pizza that another person ordered.  Mine was only a 10 inch although a little more would be okay since I have now lost 30 pounds on this journey. This is also the day that I saw the bear and with the last few days being dry, mostly sunny, it has been a fun experience.
5/11-12, Day 59,60  Staying at the Travel Inn in Marion to resupply, laundry and shower ... rest my body and enjoy the experience of these small towns.  You have to eat at the My Puerto restaurant if you ever visit Marion.  The best Mexican food, service and prices.  Also able to watch 2 hockey playoff games, some of the Players golf tournament in Jacksonville FL (I used to live there and went to the tournament 2 years ago), and spend some time at the local library to use their computer to update my trail journal and get some necessary work done as not everything left behind takes care of itself, although Silvia, my wife, does an absolutely fantastic job of handling most everything so I am free to enjoy this trip.  Thank you my dear.
Well, time to head out to see some more of the town.  All my best and heading back to the AT tomorrow.  Hope to start doing a consistent 14-16 miles a day, but more importantly, to continue to enjoy each day.","Damascus VA North

That is darn good. 5/13 Day 61. First day out from Damascus VA and covered 13.7 miles to Davis Hollow. Had amazing trail magic today from a local church at the Lindamood School, a 1 room old schoolhouse. Hot dogs, hamburgers, soda, casseroles, snacks ... mmmmm. Also passed under Rt 81 for the first of 4 times that will happen. 5/14 Day 62. 12.6 miles to Knot Maul Shelter. Each day is difficult, some more difficult and some less difficult. Today was more. Temperatures up to 80F, and humid, which is way different than I have had so far. Wanted to go further but my legs and feet said no. Guess what, passed the mile mark of 548, which is 1/4 of the way to Katahdin !!!!!5/15 Day 63. 12.2 miles and then stealth camped early due to thunderstorms. Now into ridge walking so constant up and down but generally not big elevation changes. 5/16 Day 64. Only 7.9 miles due to rain, rain, rain. Stayed at Jenkins Shelter. 5/17 Day 65. Bypassed Bland VA today although stopped for lunch at the Bushy Mtn Outfitters, which is right on the trail. Rain, rain again and occasional sun ... 13.5 miles to Helveys Mill Shelter. 5/18 Day 66. Rain again, all day long. This is getting depressing. Walking on a trail that mimics a river, and still managed to hit 600 AT miles at 10:27 am !!!!  Did 16.2 miles, feet are a mess, tenting outside Trent’s Grocery store. 5/19 Day 67. Finally, a day that did not rain while hiking. Rained the night before so tent was wet and rained after we (Notrix and I) reached the Woods Hole Hostel. A GREAT hostel with all organic and homemade food for dinner and homemade ice cream for desert. 15.2 miles plus the extra half mile of road walking to the hostel. Feet are like prunes. Need some rest. 5/20 Day 68. 10.6 miles of beautiful weather and great trail (other than the occasional mud, puddles and streams) into Pearisburg VA. Staying at the Angels Rest Hiker Hostel. Passed “20 Questions”, her brother and her Dad (All Ears if my memory is any good) who were slackpacking south and were at the same hostel as me last night (see the picture and email me with any corrected trail names). Lunch at DQ, watching the Las Vegas Golden Knights advance to the Stanley Cup finals and getting on a scale ... have leveled off on my weight, down 30 pounds from when I started, but same as I was 10 days ago. 5/21 Day 69.

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592415,"FRUSTRATING. Had this completely typed out and then it disapoeared  well, enough venting.
It was a great week for sights despite the ongoing rain.  Saw the Keffer Oak, met Papi, passed bears (didn’t see them), snakes, Audie Murphy memorial, Dragons Tooth, Eastern Continental Divide and hit 700 miles.  I thought Pennsylvania was famous for rocks.  Well Virgina is sure trying hard to get us ready.
5/21 Day 69. Zero day at the Angel Rest Hiker Hostel. A well run and great place to stay. Did resupply, Permethrin on my tent and clothes, lunch at Hardee’s and chef salad and chicken pot pie for dinner. And there is a story behind the pot pie. 
5/22 Day 70. Estimated at 645.4 (10 miles).  Stealth camping. Shuttle to the trailhead, start hiking at 8:55, hiked for 4:26. Set up tent then rain, stopped for dinner then rain again.  Everyone saw the bear but us. 
5/23 Day 71. 14.3 miles to Bailey Gap Shelter. 2 snakes today. One went over Notrix foot. Hiked through the clouds and some sun at the end of the day. Almost got lost after setting up my tent in the woods out of sight of the shelter and privy. Not good, have to be more careful. Permethrin seems to be working as very few bugs hovering around my tent between the rain fly and the netting. Also seems to be working on my clothes. 
5/24 Day 72. 14.6 miles to Laurel Creek Shelter. Good weather. Passed rattle snakes but never heard or saw.  Lots of ROCKS !!!!  Decided not to complete a thru hike. To many miles per day required, and I don’t think I want to put my body through it and the risk of injury is always there. My feet are so sore at the end of each day. I have to focus on each step to avoid tripping, falling, stepping on something I shouldn’t. Still want to keep going so I can hike with Ethan, Kyle and Sarah. Occasional days of web-breaker detail, first one down the trail in the morning has the luxury of breaking all the new cobwebs across the trail.  Hiked for 6:21.
5/25 Day 73. 12.4 miles to Niday Shelter. Parts were very tough and parts were much less difficult. Saw deer again. Took a picture of Papi (87 years old and a triple crowner; did the AT, PCT and CDT), the Keffer Oak, 300 years old and 18 ft around, and a sign indicating the eastern continental divide, to the West water goes to the Gulf of Mexico and to the east to the Atlantic Ocean. 
5/26 Day 74. 10.1 miles to Pickle Branch Shelter. Stopped due to rain, rain, rain. Completely soaked and boots are wet inside. No service. Pic of birds nest with eggs, flowers, Audie Murphy memorial. Galaxy Quest movie in the shelter (Ripley has a little projector and movies downloaded on his phone).
5/27 Day 75. 6.7 miles to the Four Pines Hostel to dry out, laundry, shower (drip dry). Passed the 700 mile mark. Great view from Cove Mtn and saw the Dragons Tooth rock formation. All you can eat (AYCE) lunch at the Homeplace Restaurant in Catawba. Resupply for going to Daleville at the Catawba Grocery.","Cross Ave, Pearisburg VA

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592508,"As you are aware I am doing this hike as a fundraiser. This is my chance to show you why you should donate. My son Ricky, before his death in 2015, was actively involved in the KATA Foundation which raises money to fund research into finding a cure for Fanconi anemia (FA). This disease took the life of Kendall Atkinson (Sarah Robbins (Ricky’s wife) best friend) and her brother Taylor. Today, I met for the first time, a person affected by Fanconi anemia. Her name is Olivia and she is 10 years old, a precious young lady. She and her family (parents, step brother, grandparents) all came to meet me because I was hiking to raise awareness and money to fight FA. I was so impressed. Olivia brought me a picture she had drawn of her and me, a tee shirt, an orange bracelet, pictures of her and Caleb (her big brother) and more. Most importantly she brought me a hug and a kiss. When we got in her Dad’s truck to go for lunch she showed me her stuffed sea turtle. I was floored, speechless and tears came to my eyes. You see, I have a charm on my necklace of a sea turtle which has Ricky’s ashes in it. Ricky loved sea turtles. I know that was a sign from Ricky to me that he is still supporting the KATA Foundation by watching over Olivia. That is no coincidence that this young girl, the very first person I ever met with FA, would have a sea turtle with her. At lunch I met the second person I have ever met with FA, and his family. His name is Mason. A typical 2nd grader with the energy and dreams you would expect. Now I truly know two individuals, two families of the many who are out there that will benefit from your donation to research a cure for Fanconi anemia.

Ten days since my last post, that is a little too long. In summary, I left Catawba VA for Daleville VA and discovered my tent is starting to leak a little. Not much but I better keep an eye on it. I checked into a Howard Johnson’s motel in Daleville and was able to resupply, and of course laundry and shower and watch a Stanley Cup playoff game ... yesssss !!!!! In repacking I discovered that I left my cook stove at the last campsite. So, hike back 8 miles round trip or buy a new one since there is an outfitter in town. Not hiking 8 extra miles !!!Tent now starting to leak more and since it rains most every night, I better think about fixing it. Also, saw and almost stepped on my first rattlesnake. We both saw each other at the last second and pulled away. After it coiled up and rattled at me I decided to take a circuitous walk around and away. Arrived in Glasgow VA on day 83, got a rental car and drove to Charlotte NC to visit my sister Dee, her daughter Lyndsay and Lyndsay’s husband Kris and the 4 kids (Kruz, Kanyn, Kennedy and Kashton).  A great time, great meal and then to Asheville the next day to meet Silvia, my wife, for a few days of R&R. It was a really wonderful several days. I returned to Glasgow on day 87, and the hike continues with all new people on the trail. The hikers I have been seeing are all days ahead of me now. 5/29 Day 77. 11.5 miles to Hay Rock. Great view of Carvin Cove Reservoir. Left my cook stove here. Rain of course. 5/30 Day 78. 4.0 miles to Daleville and resupply. Stayed at Howard Johnson’s 5/31 Day 79. Wilson Creek Shelter and more rain. 11.2 miles and the tent is leaking more. 6/1 Day 80.

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594250,"Another 75.3 miles completed, and passed the 800 mile mark !!!This week was tough. Much rain at the beginning then sun the last couple days. The sun allowed me to dry out my tent, but my clothes and boots stayed wet. You see, my boots are waterproof which was great for the earlier cold, snow, mud and light rain. In a downpour the water gets in but cannot get out. It’s like walking in a squishy puddle of water and your feet suffer, a lot. So, the last day of this post was a trip to the Rockfish Gap Outfitters for new hiking boots, non-waterproof and low cut. These will dry out quicker when wet, save some weight and give me better traction, since the tread on my Keen boots was starting to wear down. Hopefully I will not get, or have manageable, blisters as I break in the new Oboz Sawtooth Low hiking boots. Nothing against the Keen boots, they were great for their purpose and I had planned to switch out from them at some point. The highlights of this week were ... great trail magic one day and made good miles (by my standard), made it to the end of the Blue Ridge Parkway and the beginning of the Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park. Most of the hiking was as expected ... up, down and wet. ————6/9 Day 88. Made it 13.3 miles to Reservoir Rd and camped along the Pedlar River. Sun today, cooked dinner then spilled dinner, burned my finger, made a new dinner then jumped in my tent as the rains came. 6/10 Day 89. GREAT trail magic at the end of 13.1 miles of hiking, Hog Pen Gap, just as I ran out of water (beer, Gatorade, sandwiches, snacks and more). Good weather to hike until the rains came late afternoon and soaked me, my clothes and the tent. Oh well, it is all part of the adventure. It’s only water. 6/11 Day 90. Three months on the trail. 14.3 miles to the Priest Shelter where hikers confess their sins in the logbook. Rain again and cold this night. 6/12 Day 91. Hiked 13.8 miles to Maupin Field Shelter. No rain today. Yeah !!!!  However, boots wet, socks wet and feet a mess. So far this has been one of the hardest weeks, but again, just put one foot in front of the other. There are others in this world who have far greater challenges than me. Happy anniversary to my Mom in heaven and my Dad in Rochester NY. It would be 70 years. 6/13 Day 92.

Went southbound from Riprap parking lot in the SNP (Shenandoah National Park) back to Waynesboro, 17.1 miles. This way I could stay at the hostel another night. Saw 4 bears on the hike, a momma with 2 cubs and another adult who was using the same trail as me ... until he saw me !!!  New boots are doing well.Next day I ate at my first Wayside (a quick food restaurant along the Skyline Drive in SNP).  The blackberry milkshake hit the spot. Stayed at the Loft Mtn. Campsite that night and my tenting neighbors, Noni and Julie, made me dinner. Greatly appreciated.

That evening was a short hike to the Jim & Molly Denton Shelter, which I think is one of the most unique on the trail (solar shower, porch with chairs with backs, eating pavilion, horseshoes).

Also had some earlier trail magic (beer) so this day went really well, especially hearing my great nephew huffing and puffing behind me up the trail. And even more trail magic from Noah at Pen-Mar Park (quiche, vegetables, soda, beer !!!) and then we ordered a pizza to be delivered to the park.  It was a little more than we could eat so the extra became breakfast for the next morning. Crossed the Mason-Dixon Line into PA and I actually had tears in my eyes when I thought of where I was and how far I had come.

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597999,"After a week off the trail I was ready to go. A big thanks to Lark (sister in law) and Werner (high school friend) to drive me back to the AT. I had already finished over 1100 miles with no medical issues so I was pretty cocky about cranking out some consistent miles with a goal of CT by mid August.  I had been doing 14+ mile days which was about my limit. The rain came in the early afternoon the first day so after only 2.5 miles I set up my tent to keep dry. The next 2 days were dry and I did just over 14 miles each day, over rocks, some overgrown trail but relatively flat terrain. I think after the week off that was pushing to hard as I developed a soreness in my right leg. After a resupply in Hamburg PA, including lunch at 5 Guys (yeahhh !!!), it was 10 AT miles but counting the walk to town, another day that was maybe a little to long for me. On the hike today I ran into Waterfall and her dog, Ieda. I first met them in GA, received my Dog Whisperer trail name due to my interaction with her dog, and last saw them over 1000 miles ago. It was great to see them as I had been hoping to see them again. Next was a shorter 9 mile day but my leg was now more sore than before and I stopped at the Eckville Shelter about noon to avoid the rain that came that day and night, and to rest my leg.  While there I decided I should rest a couple days plus the weather forecast was rain for at least the next 7 days, so I contacted my nephew Nate and his wife Megan who live about 60 miles away to stay at their house ... he picked me up the next morning and that is where I am now. Lunch for all 5 of us today at Victory Brewing was a welcome plus to my adventure. Thank you to my great nephew, Aiden, for letting me have his room ... with all these cool toys !!!!
I am really into the saying “Hike your own hike” and am embracing that by taking each day, obstacle and challenge along the way as part of “my hike”, without worrying about the miles. 7/17 Day 126. Ride down to Lickdale PA from Lark and Werner. Stealth camping after only 2.5 miles. Stopped early due to rain. 7/18 Day 127. Hertline campsite after 14.4 miles. Wet trail from yesterday’s rain. Rocks. 7/19 Day 128. Phillips Canyon Spring area for camping after 14.1 miles. Sunny, nice campsite with “Prone To Wander”.  Sore right leg. Lots of rocks. 7/20 Day 129. Windsor Furnace Shelter, 10.1 miles. Did a resupply in Hamburg PA at Walmart and lunch at 5 Guys. Waterfall and Ieda. 7/21 Day 130. Eckville Shelter, 9.1 miles. Rain, supposed to rain for days, sore leg is worse. Contacted Nate and Megan (nephew and his wife) to get off the trail for a few days. 7/22 Day 131. Went to Nate and Megan’s house and will stay a few days to heal up and escape the rain. Lunch at Victory Brewery was excellent.","Rt 72, Lickdale PA

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598878,"A great 3 days with Nate, Megan, Aiden, Josie and Paige (the dog).  Watched Aiden’s basketball team win it’s first playoff game and we had a little challenge at foosball. Maybe next time Aiden !!!  We also caught an animated movie, Hotel Transylvania 3 and they served food right to your seat. That was new to me. Back to the trail on 7/25 (thank you Megan), just in time to slip on the rocks and fall. Only a minor scrape but snapped one of my trekking poles in half. You would think with all the weight I’ve lost it might have just bent !!!  Anyway, completed 7.4 miles to the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter before the rain came. The next day was a modest 10.0 miles, still trying to take it easy on my leg. Tented at the Bake Oven Shelter after a day of sun, some BIG rocks but mostly nice trail. Pennsylvania is certainly the flattest State so far. On 7/27 I did the down and then the up into and out of Palmerton, including HUGH rocks and then the Superfund detour as the environmental cleanup of the previous zinc smelting plant is ongoing.  12.7 miles. Passed over the Lehigh Tunnel and ended up at Blue Mountain Rd, set up my tent and then walked to the Slopeside Pub & Grill for dinner (a winter ski area). Back in my tent before the rain came. Followed that up with another 12.7 mile day, mostly sun, a little rain in the AM but a beautiful camp site in a clearing on top of a ridge. An almost full moon made for a peaceful night. On 7/29 I was at my destination, the Kirkridge Shelter by 2 PM. Only 6.5 more miles to Delaware Water Gap and a church run hostel. I pushed on hoping my leg and my feet could handle it and completed the sunny 18.2 miles to the Church Of The Moutain Hiker Center. Had a nice dinner and a couple beers at the Sycamore Grille with Citizen, 5 Mile and Steve who I had been crossing paths with the past 2 days.Finally, a day of rest, or at least not hiking as I went into Stroudsburg for laundry, resupply and lunch. The surprise today was Waterfall and Aida (I now have the correct spelling for Aida, my canine friend) showing up at the hostel. Unfortunately they are heading off trail for Aida to recover from a Copperhead snake bite. Such a sweet, friendly and happy dog. I felt great that she came right over to me, tail wagging. 7/23-24 Day 132-133. At Nate, Megan, Aiden and Josie’s house. 7/25 Day 134. Back on the trail for 7.4 miles to the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter. 7/26 Day 135. Tented at Bake Oven Knob Shelter after 10.0 miles. 7/27 Day 136.

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600318,"Before I summarize the next ten days I wanted to share some of the phrases you hear often on the AT. A few of these are mine, but most are “official” phrases (and I added some comments after them).
1- It’s not the miles, but the smiles (my biggest smiles were when I ignored the miles and enjoyed what each day had to offer)
2- Carry in , carry out (I think every hiker should carry out more than they carry in)
3- Leave no trace (except dead mosquitoes and black flies, I think that is ok)
4- Take only pictures, leave only footprints (again, leaving dead mosquitoes and black flies is ok by me)
5- Enjoy the journey, not just the destination (this is a saying that I have tried to instill in my boys)
6- The AT is sometimes more difficult, sometimes less difficult. Never easy. (my own perspective)
7- Virginia is flat (ha ha, it is not)
———————-
7/31 Day 140. Tented at Rattlesnake Spring after 13.5 miles. Ahhh, another bear (#6) and this one was closer and bigger than the others. We stared at each other, at about 15 yards, while it stood on its back legs and peaked around a tree. Then, both our curiosities satisfied, we each walked off in opposite directions. Another snake also today plus walked by Sunfish Pond and hit 1300 miles.  Yes, 1300 miles !!!
8/1 Day 141. Brink Shelter and 11.3 miles through the rain. Stayed in the shelter due to the rain. 
8/2 Day 142. Rutherford Shelter. Another night in the shelter. Rain and sun. 15.0 miles. Getting closer to NY. 
8/3 Day 143. 10.8 miles to Unionville NY. The AT was still in NJ but a 0.7 mile road walk took me into NY. Tented in the town park. Before the rain was a late lunch at Horler’s Grocery (roast beef sandwich since they ran out of sub rolls and of course, a pint of chocolate ice cream). Dinner was at Annabel’s Pizza, a chicken and portobello mushroom panini. I’m sure eating well tonight ... and then 13 hours of nonstop rain overnight. The tent leaked and everything I have is wet. 
8/4 Day 144. Zero day. In Wayne NJ at Veronika and Matt’s as these friends picked me up, and I was able to dry everything out, do laundry and eat well again (liver and onions, yum !!). True trail angels and trail magic with this support coming just as I truly needed it. Met Veronika and Matt’s new baby, Maddox, and Matt’s twins, Taylor and Ryan. 
8/5 Day 145. Stealth camp after 15.0 miles by a stream. Nice site but very tired and feet aching from the last 150 miles of rocks. Did manage to grab a hot dog and an ice cream at a road crossing. That was after I missed a trail turn and walked an extra mile. Not the first time, and not the last. It tends to happen when you are always looking down where you are walking to avoid tripping. Also I want to mention some well appreciated boardwalks in NJ, through swamps and bogs. 
8/6 Day 146. Wildcat Shelter. 14.8 miles and into NY. Another state completed. Yeah !!!!  And, can you believe it ... another road crossing with ice cream, milkshakes, water and phone charging. Ahhh, the trail is good. Even had sun today. 
8/7 Day 147. Tuxedo Motel, 9.9 miles. HOT, sun, rain, rocks ... well, so much for a good trail. Reached Rt 17 and could not pass up the Tuxedo Motel two miles down the road. Time to use Lyft !!! Shower, free laundry and able to dry out again. I needed that to get my head back into a positive frame of mind. Ordered out for pizza and a turkey sub !!  That also helped my mental state. 
8/8 Day 148. William Brian Memorial Shelter. Sun, hot, BUGS !!!! 9.7 miles. Stopped early, tired from the heat and wanted to escape the mosquitoes. Set up my tent and climbed in. I have been passed by many SOBO’s (southbound hikers) over the past week. Today was a father and two kids, ages 8 & 10, who started their hike at Mt. Katahdin ME and are heading to GA. I heard they have done a 30 mile day. 
8/9 Day 149. Hemlock Springs campsite. Sunny, good trail, up and down Bear Mtn, a concession stand by Hessian Lake, a trailside zoo and crossed the Hudson. 12.4 miles today. Most of the day hiked with Ron, Holy Ghost and Thunderbolt (and two other hikers, a couple, that I do not have their names). Great weather today, maybe the best I have had the whole hike.","Delaware Water Gap

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600951,"Update for Friday, August 10, 2018 (sorry for the delay, I needed to keep my leaving the trail a surprise until now)
WOW !!!!   150 days since I started hiking the AT, almost 5 full months ago. Most people I started with are way ahead of me, or for various reasons, are no longer hiking. Each, without judgment, has their own reason, or reasons, for starting to hike and each has their own reasons for stopping, continuing, or the miles they do each day.  That is the true meaning of HIKE YOUR OWN HIKE. A saying that not only I firmly embrace but every hiker I have met out here also supports. It is so critical for each individual to hike what feels right for them.
For me, August 10th is my last day of hiking the AT this year. This is me, hiking my own hike and enjoying the journey, not just the destination.
As most of you know one of my reasons for this hike is to raise awareness of the disease Fanconi anemia and to raise money towards researching a cure.  The KATA Foundation is the charity that my son Ricky supported in many ways.  Currently the donations to the KATA Foundation, researching a cure for Fanconi anemia, is approximately $5,270, a very significant amount.  I am pushing to reach $6,000.  I pledge to match any and all contributions dollar for dollar in order to reach that goal.  Any help you can provide is appreciated.  For those that have already donated, a huge THANK YOU !!!!www.katafoundation.orgI’ll take questions now: 1- Why stop now?My priority is family over getting to Maine this year. I stopped now so I could surprise my Dad for his 93rd birthday and my mother in law for her 94th birthday. That is why I did not post this sooner, I did not want to spoil the surprise. Now I can also rest my feet and enjoy time with Silvia (my wife) and NinaMoo (our dog). 2- Do you plan to finish next year?I plan to finish sometime and to hike next year. Finishing next year, I do not know at this time. 3- What was your favorite part of the trail?There were many, hiking the Grayson Highlands with the wild ponies, the accomplishments of reaching the tops of different mountains (Sassafras, Blood, Rogers to name a few), walking across bald mountains, seeing black bears, timber rattlesnakes and copperhead snakes, the people I have met on trail and the friends and family I have met along this adventure. However, what stands out the most are meeting children with Fanconi anemia ... Olivia, Mason and Eli. Being able to carry on some of my son Ricky’s work by fundraising to research a cure for this disease. 4- Did you see bears or other dangerous animals?Yes. I saw 6 bears (plus another 2 but they were in a zoo), 2 timber rattlesnakes and 1 Copperhead (poisonous) snake.  I heard coyotes howling at night but never saw them.  I am sure I would have seen more if not constantly staring at my feet to avoid tripping on rocks and tree roots. Thank you all for following me, and some for joining me, on this adventure of a lifetime.  Wishing you all the best ... until next year !!!!","Hemlock Springs campsite

I am back and ready to go.  But first, thank you everyone for a wonderful and successful 2018.  We raised $6000 for the KATA foundation to research a cure for Fanconi anemia.  Silvia, my wife, and I were fortunate to attend the KATA fundraiser dinner in Denver CO last November.  Driving out we attended with Sarah, our daughter in law (Ricky's wife) and it was an experience I will never forget.  The children and the adults we met, or at least saw at this event ... it was heart warming and uplifting.  I know the money donated by so many for my hike will make a difference.
As you know, I hiked my own hike.  I went speeds that worked for me and was really thankful to get off the trail for several meaningful family events.  Surprising my Dad for his 93rd birthday and my mother in law for her 94th, those were memorable experiences.  I also became know as a LASH (Long Ass Section Hiker) since I was not a thru hiker.
As a result of all the positives last year, it was a no brainer that I want, and need, to finish the complete AT.  My plan is to finish this year but if something outside my control holds me back, then the finish may be delayed ... but I will finish.  I have 40 miles in the Smoky Mountains to complete, plus 780.6 miles from NY to Mt. Katahdin ME.  The Smoky Mtn. section is planned for this April and the NY to ME section is mid May to mid August.

Last year was a truly fantastic experience and met all my objectives, and then some.  I expect this year to be tougher hiking (in NH and ME) but also fantastic scenery and to exceed all my expectations.  I can’t wait to get started !!!

Overall, the weather has been good.  Some rain, but not too bad.  The trail has been a challenge for me, I am not yet trail conditioned so the ups and steep downs have been difficult.
I have met (more like seen) quite a few other hikers this past week.  Most doing a couple days, some longer sections, and a few that are thru hiking.  The thru hikers are mostly flip-floppers, generally starting in Harper's Ferry WV, although 1 or 2 started early in GA and have already reached and passed me.  Everyone passes me, and I think once I get my trail legs, they still will as I continue to hike my own hike.

My recommendations for a shelter are Tom Leonard shelter with great tent views into a ravine, although the best being Upper Goose Pond Cabin ... a real cabin with a caretaker (Pete when I was there), pancake breakfast, bunks, rocking chairs, canoes and a pond to swim in (a very COLD pond).
5/22 Glenbrook shelter.  Several mountains and a semi-hard day.  Met Barry and Hans SoSlo, and Legolas.  Mile 1514.9

By the end of next week I will be back on the AT in Virginia, supporting Ethan, my great nephew as he hikes.  Ethan hiked with me last year for about 2 weeks and 170 miles.  This year he is hiking for about 3 weeks and 300 miles and I will be day hiking on the AT to meet up with him, doing trail magic for AT hikers at road crossings, resupplying Ethan along the way, and camping in central and northern VA (trading in my tent for my car and a popup trailer).  All this will lead up to a return to Rochester NY for the annual RFR (Round Fore Ricky) on July 12th, a fundraiser for a college scholarship in Ricky's name.
So, I guess in am ""repurposing"" my hike to still stay involved with the AT, but in a different way.  I will continue to provide updates along the way, and continue to ask your support to the KATA foundation.Thank you and all of God's blessings to each of you.

8/2 Monday - 8.9 miles to Story Spring Shelter.  Trail conditions about the same, not very good but starting to dry out a little.  It was the wettest July in history for VT.  Nice view of the clouds from Glastonbury fire tower.
8/3 Tuesday - 10.5 miles to Stratton Pond Shelter.  Always, if possible, in a tent but at the shelter for water, a dry place if it rains, privy, occasional bear box for food storage, and people to talk to.  Hiked over Stratton Mt.  Full Moon and Lady In Pink who I would see for the next week, 4 Long Trail (LT) section hikers - Doc, Ender, Chris and Junko.
8/4 Wednesday - 10.5 miles to Manchester Center, Green Mountain House hostel.  Great place.  Only had room for me for 1 night so I resupplied, ate a burger, fries and milkshake and headed out the next day. Picked up a sleep pad at Mountain Goat Outfitters.  Full Moon and Lady in Pink were at the hostel.  Climbed Spruce Peak.
8/5 Thursday - 10.1 miles to Peru Peak Shelter.  Family of 4 from Wisconsin (Packman, Fixed Gear, Crabs and Ground Score) plus 4 from GA (David, Mark and Pravin) who came up to hike a few days with Waffles.  I gave Waffles my card to contact me when she got to NC for any trail magic needed.  Over Bromley Mt. and Peru Peak.
8/6 Friday - 9.7 miles to Little Rock Pond Shelter.  Went swimming in the pond, nice shelter.  Saw Chippin Away again (2nd time I think) and she helped me reach Silvia by text to see if she broke or sprained her ankle.  Met a mother and daughter section hiker (Margaret and Sarah).  The trail continues to dry out with minimal rain, a few evening showers, so the mud is disappearing, but the rocks, roots and up and down is here to stay.
8/7 Saturday - 9.9 miles to Minerva Hinchey Shelter.  Over Bear Mt (there seem to be several of them over the past few states).  Chippin away and the Milwaukee family were at the shelter.  Trail continues to improve as the rains hold off.  That can't last.  Silvia's ankle is sprained.  She wants me to keep on hiking although I would haed back to FL tomorrow if she needed me.
8/8 Sunday - 9.8 miles to Governor Clement Shelter.  Not a bad day but I am SORE.  Even these days have many ups and downs and hopefully are making my hiking legs stronger.  One foot in front of the other.  I've been able to stay in my tent every day except when in town. Still with Chippin Away (who gets up at 5 am and leaves before I even wake up at 6 am).  Milwaukee family also here.
8/9 Monday - 10.6 miles to Rutland, RT 4 in VT, the Yellow Deli Hostel.  Great food, bed felt like only a box spring (top bunk).  Lots of people.  Went over Killington Mt.  It is BIG.  The last .2 miles, blue trail, was STEEP.  Chippin Away was here plus Full Moon and Lady in Pink (2 zero days) who all left the next morning.  Free bus from Rt 4 to downtown, right near the Yellow Deli.
8/10 Tuesday - ZERO miles.  First day off with no hiking.  Resupply, laundry, library for using a computer.  Relaxing.
All in all, a good start for my hike.  I sure appreciate the support I have from family and friends.  I expect to hike for about 8 weeks and wherever I end up, is where I stop  Hike your own hike.  I miss Silvia the most.  Ricky is spiritually with me everyday, and Kyle is too.  Looking forward to seeing Kyle and Kristen, SIlvia and NinaMoo, Dad, Bob and Lark at the end of September.  Bye for now.  One day at a time.","Bennington, VT

8/12 - 9.9 miles to Wintturi Shelter - rained during the night but after I set up my tent.  Lookout cabin was a beautiful stop.  Everyone is going so fast, except me, that gets a little lonely.  Thought about why I am out here and it is generally not to finish but to get exercise, see nature, think and grieve.
8/13 - 12.3 miles to Thistle Hill Shelter - the weather has been good, and rains stopped the day I started hiking (Aug 1).  It continues to be hot and humid, with the resulting chaffing and still sore feet.  A couple good views and many PUD's (Pointless Up and Downs).
8/14 - 9.3 miles to Happy Hill Shelter - the map looks like the past few days are easier but on the AT it is never easy, always hard, some days a little less hard.  I see many SOBO (southbound) hikers and have to admit, I am a little jealous as they have completed the hardest section.
8/15 - 6.4 miles into Hanover NH, home of Dartmouth College and a stay at the Hanover Adventure Tours Hostel (along the Connecticut River on the VT side).  I may stay an extra day there to see how my body and feet are doing.  Had lunch at Molly's Restaurant in Hanover, dinner at Jeff's BBQ food truck next to the hostel.
I have to say, the people passing me is expected, as they have their trail legs and have been hiking for 4 months.  They can do 18-22 miles a day, but will be slowed by the White Mountains of NH to 10-12 miles per day.  What will I be slowed down to if I am doing 10 miles a day now?  I'll think about this while I rest this afternoon and tomorrow.  One day at a time and hike your own hike.","Rutland VT

Dog Whisperer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/642857,"Hello everyone.  Yes, I have decided to get off trail for now ... who knows, I may get back on next year.  Never say never.In any case, I have many reasons for stopping my hike after 15 days.  I hike to enjoy the journey and am not too focused on the destination, although each time I start out I do have a schedule that gets me to the end.  This years scheduled would have me pushing each day to reach Katahdin by the date I need to stop for family events in late September.  Instead of listing the pros and cons to continue, let me just say I am sticking to my mantra of ... hike your own hike (although my doctors visit to address an infection in my foot does not help). 8/16 - after a nights sleep in a hostel (almost as good as my tent), my cousin from Albany and her husband picked me up about 11:15 am and took me back to the Albany-Rensselaer train station.  It was interesting to cross the Vermont AT intersections by car, which I hiked across many days before.  We stopped for lunch in Manchester (Bob's Diner) and that evening caught the train to Rochester NY.  There another cousin picked me up and dropped me at my Dad's about 11:30 pm.  A special thanks to these cousins for lending a hand.8/17 - up early and got a ""to go"" breakfast for my Dad from the Lehigh Restaurant (which subsequently closed permanently the following week, hopefully not because of me).  Happy 96th Birthday Dad !!  Had a flight back home to Florida that day, dropped at the airport by my brother, picked up at the airport in Florida my my wife ... and of course the our dog, NinaMoo.  Both seemed very glad to see me but the dog definitely acted the most excited !!  Stopped at my sister and brother in law to meet their new rescue dog, Ipo, and to pick up our granddaughter who was spending some time with them.  Then off to our granddaughters house, some dinner with my step daughter and her husband and our granddaughter and finally home.A few things have happened at home, and although my wife encouraged me to keep hiking, I felt it was best to be home and help out.  I am extremely happy with my decision, proud of the 1750 miles completed, and looking forward to the many family events we have planned.  Thank you for all your support.","Hanover, NH
