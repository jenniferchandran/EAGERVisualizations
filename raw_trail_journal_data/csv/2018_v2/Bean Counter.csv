Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586795,"I was not planning on doing a section hike this year but got a call from How Far a couple of weeks ago asking if I wanted to hike a few days and it only took a couple of minutes to make a decision. We will be heading to Harper’s Ferry on May 1st to hike 7-10 days. That’s about 100 miles from where I got off last year but I will make up that section later. 
From Harper’s Ferry we will head north. This section has many historical sites, state parks, shelters and is one of the easier sections of the AT to hike. Our goal would be to make it to Ducannon and have a meal at the Doyle Hotel, one of the many iconic places on the trail.
We have David, a friend from Clarkesville, and Ron who we met while hiking in 2015 joining us. We will meet up at the Teahorse hostel and spend the night of the 1st and head north on the 2nd. The hostel provides a shuttle service and will come pick us up when we are completed.
I look forward to sharing my journal with you.",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Sun",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587984,"This past weekend I attended my first Bike Ride Across Georgia (BRAG) event, “Spring Tune Up”. This is a 3 day event located on a farm where you pick the distance you want to ride daily and everything else is taken care of. Well you do have to ride the bike, but as us hikers would call it Trail Magic is provide every 10-15 miles, a support vehicle is available if needed and you camp out at night. Bands play every night, food trucks are available, portable showers are provided so as you can see it’s a pretty nice event. I enjoyed it so much that I have signed up for the Big Brag Event the first week of June that is a 7 day trip across the Georgia mountains riding 50-60 miles per day. They take care of moving your gear daily but provide everything that they did for the Spring Tune Up. Looking forward to this adventure when I return from the trail.I have been in contact with Gary, David and Ron and everything is set for us to start hiking from Harpers Ferry on Wednesday, May 2nd.",,Rutledge Georgia,"Apr 25, Wed",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588083,"I still have a few days before we take off but I tried to get everything ready today because tomorrow the weather is suppose to be good and I need to get my yard work completed. Saturday we are heading to Alabama to Gary (How Far) and Angie’s home. Gary and I are going to the Talladega 500 Sunday thanks to his wife getting tickets, pit passes and a parking pass for us. This will be my first NASCAR race and I’m excited to be able to go. On Monday we will head home and then take off Tuesday morning heading to Harpers Ferry.After getting my pack all loaded up I weighted it and with 6 days of food it weighted 31 lbs., not light by anyone’s standard. There is somewhere to resupply about 3 days in but it’s a 2.5 mile trip to town and with 4 of us hiking it will be a little tough for all of us to get a lift so we will just suffer for a couple of days until we eat some of it.My next post will be Wednesday night if I have cell service. If not I will update once I do have cell service. Thanks for reading my journal.",,View Entry,"Apr 26, Thu",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588697,"David, Gary and I left Clarkesville this morning and made it to Harpers Ferry about 5:00 today. Ron had gotten here shortly before us and we headed into the historic section of town for dinner. After having to leave the first restaurant we stopped at because they were getting ready to close we eventually found one opened. After dinner we drove up the trail for Ron to leave his car because he is only hiking for a couple of days.There are a few other hikers here at the hostel tonight but only one thru-hiker who has made it this far. She is hiking 25 miles per day. That’s moving on. We are all ready to hit the trail tomorrow.",,Harpers Ferry,"May 01, Tue",0
Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588821,"Today started off with me trying to find my Tilley Hat. I have worn it every day on the trail and I couldn’t find it. I think I finally figured it out. Last night when unloading the truck I set my hat on the side rail on the truck to get my pack out of the back seat. It must have fallen in the back and I didn’t see it. When we went to dinner it probably blew out of the truck without us knowing it. Anyway I quickly went to Walmart before we left and purchased a hat. Not what I wanted but I didn’t have many to choose from.
We walked through the old historical part of Harpers Ferry on our way to the trail and off we went. The first few miles was all flat and shared with a bike path and then we had a somewhat hard climb since this was our first day of hiking. We continued along and made pretty good time until Ron felt ill and decided he better get off the trail. We all made it to the War Correspondents Monument where he was able to call for a shuttle to come pick him up.
While there we met a Trail Angel who knew who I was. When I told her my trail name and and that I hiked in 2015 she said that she had followed my journal. She gave us some food and drink that hit the spot. People like her make this hike so much nicer.We also met a couple from Kalamazoo who are hiking the same part of the trail that we are. We also met a couple of thru-hikers and several other section hikers.
We made it to the camp site, got our tents set up, ate dinner, talked awhile and now we are in our tents looking forward to a good nights sleep. It’s been very hot today so we need it to cool down a little.","Harpers Ferry

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589048,"This morning I woke up to How Far and Blood Root talking and thought I had overslept but both of them were just up early. Blood Root is David’s trail name now. It’s a plant that is one of the first to bloom in the spring.
We decided we could hike 1.5 miles further than we had planned and get to Annapolis Rocks that according to my guide book has campsites with great views. Unfortunately my guide book is the 2015 model and the entire place is being restored, although there are some campsites just without the view. We did get to stop about half-way today and take a hot shower out in the middle of nowhere. That was nice but within 30 minutes we were soaking wet again. It’s been close to 90 deg both days so far and we had not planned on this.
We stopped at the original Washington Mounment that the citizens built back in the 1800’s. It was pretty neat with great views. 
We were all pretty dehydrated by the time we got our tents set up and couldn’t do anything but go to bed. The other thing about this campsite that the guide doesn’t tell you about is it is near I-70 and you can hear the traffic all night long.","Crampton Gap Shelter

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589054,"Somtimes your best plans have to change to fit the situation. We were all still tired this morning and just didn’t have a lot of energy. We had an ambitious goal to go about 11 miles today but when we got to the Wolfsville Rd about 6 miles in I threw out an idea to the guys. Why not hitch a ride into town, only 1.5 miles, eat lunch and come back and walk about .3 miles to the nearest shelter. They both agreed that sounded like a good idea. After about 10 minutes this gentlemen in a truck stopped and picked us up. He took us to the deli and said he would be going back out way at about 2:00 o’clock and if we wanted a ride just meet him out by the road. We were waiting on him when this lady pulled up and asked if we needed a ride somewhere. We said yes and we jumped in. Well not exactly jump because she had a small car and we had to hold our  backpacks in our lap. When we got back to the trail she asked if we wanted to stay the night in her Air BnB. I first asked her how much and she said ever how much we wanted to give her. I told her that I wouldn’t know how much and she gave us a price that was more than reasonable. She doesn’t advertise to the hiker community but she is in an excellent location where there is no other options to stay.
So we are piled up in the BnB, had hot showers and washing our clothes now. We will be back on the trail tomorrow probably hiking in the rain.","Annapolis Rocks

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589217,"After spending a great night in the BnB it was time to move on this morning. We all slept great but Blood Root’s air mattress lost air during the night and he was on the floor when he woke up this morning.
In looking at the weather forecast for tonight and tomorrow we decided we needed to probably find somewhere to hold up until Monday morning. We listed out all our options and in the end we decided to hike about 10 miles to Pen Mar Park and go to a hostel close by. I am still using my 2015 Guide Book and we found out the hostel we were trying to go to isn’t open any longer. At that point we called the Days Inn and made a reservation but when I called the shuttle driver listed in the guide I never got them. I guess the outdated guide failed me again. I called the motel and asked if he had a list of shuttle drivers and he quickly gave me a name of one. I called him and he was there in about 5 minutes and took us to the motel. 
We are in Waynesboro Pa. and it’s an old town but many of the buildings and homes have been renovated and look good.
The rain started just about the time we arrived but it didn’t stop us from walking a couple of blocks to a restaurant where we filled our stomachs to the max.
On the way back to the motel Blood Root spotted 3 VW vans at a car lot and had to walk over and get a picture to send to his daughter who would love to have one.
We took showers and then walked to the local store to buy some snacks for the evening and then it was back to the motel. We have been relaxing and catching up on our mail, and news.
We plan to stay here tomorrow since it is supposed to rain all day. If this was 2015 when I tried to through hike I would have kept going. As the saying goes: No Rain, No Pain, No Maine. If you are trying to go the distance you can’t stop because of the rain but in our case we have no destination we have to reach so why be miserable in the rain.","Crampton Gap Shelter

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589346,"Thank goodness we were in a motel last night because we had some pretty strong thunder storms come through. This morning we woke up but not before having been woken up right after midnight by a large group of folks just checking in.
We headed over to our continental breakfast where we tried just about everything they had. While there we met three through hikers who have just started and are doing a flip flop. A flip flop is when you start in Harpers Ferry and walk north to Maine and then come back to Harpers Ferry and hike south to Georgia. This allows you to miss the large number of hikers starting on Georgia. One of them was getting off the trail today to have his knee checked out.
We hung out on the room while it rained until about 4:00 when we walked down to the pizza place for dinner.
Backed at the room we finished off a 1/2 gallon of ice cream before we got our things organized and ready for the morning.
We have adjusted our plans to finish up early Friday morning and hopefully get a ride back to my truck to head home. 
The weather is looking great for the next few days.","Days Inn

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589467,"We had the shuttle pick us up at 6:30 this morning and we were on the trail by 7:00. Within the first 5 minutes of hiking we came to the Mason Dixon Line. I guess we are not in the south any longer.
We had to make a decision whether to carry all our water for 6 miles or hike an additional mile after getting to camp to get it. We made the decision to carry it but the only problem was the 1,000 ft climb we had to make. We managed to make it and the total 15 miles and were in camp at 3:30. Quick tent set up, a hot dinner and we are all in our tents by 6:00. There are a lot of hikers here tonight. There’s one lady from London here.
We will repeat the process again tomorrow.","Pen Mar Park

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589805,"Last night I was woken up twice by someone camped up the hill who must have had a stomach virus. He was so loud and sick I felt sorry for whoever it was. It’s bad enough to be sick but out here where there is nothing you can immediately to about it just makes it that much worse.
We were up and going by 7:00 this morning. We had several climbs today with one 1,000 ft one. We managed to make all of them and roll into our place tonight by 2:30. We did about 13 miles today. 
The highlight of today was seeing  the Quarry Gap Shelter. Mr. Jim Stauch is the caretaker and I have never seen a shelter this nice. Not sure if there is one better going north but it’s the best. It had a swing, flowers planted and hung, and art in the privy (outhouse for you that don’t know). You can tell Jim takes pride in his work. I could have stayed on that swing all day.
We also met a group of young teens, about 15 with two young adults with them heading south. Not sure how long they have been out here or how long they are staying but they didn’t look happy to be here although one young gentleman came up to me and reached out his hand to shake mine and introduced himself. It could have been a type of adventure bound group.
We only have a couple more days of hiking and it will be time to head home. It’s been a good trip so far. Wish Ron could have made a couple more days with us.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589810,"Last night the temp must have been around 40 deg because I was cold. I brought my summer sleeping bag but I had on a base layer and was wearing my down jacket but that still wasn’t enough.
Being cold helps to get you up and moving and we were hiking before 7:00. The trail was some of the best I have seen on the trail. We were walking on a dirt road for the most part and made good time before lunch.
Our first highlight of the day was passing the official half-way point. We stop for pictures and continued on toward Pine Grove Furnace State Park where we thought everything was closed but to our surprise the store and grill was open. We ate buffalo wraps and fries along with some soft drinks and some other snacks. This is also where the through-hikers take on the 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge. We watched several down the 1/2 gallon.
Next door to the store is the Appalachian Trail Museum which has a lot of interesting things to see. They have one of the original shelters in the museum along with personal articles of the early hikers of the trail. 
We rested at the pavilion for a little while and borrowed some more electricity and then headed out again. Tonight we are camped right by the trail with just enough room for our three tents.
Tomorrow is going to be a 15 mile day but we will only have a .5 miles to go on Friday morning for our shuttle pick up.","Birch Run Shelter

Bean Counter,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589821,"Today was a big day. It was our last day to hike except for about 1/2 mile we will go in the morning to meet our shuttle. It’s been a good trip made up of almost 100 miles.
We were hiking by 6:30 and made good time all day. There was a store at about mile 5 that we stopped at that had a grill and we had a hamburger and fries for breakfast. Not bad st all. As we were leaving the store the rain started but we never had any real hard rain so it wasn’t too bad. At one point we had to go through a rock maze that seem to last forever but overall it was fun, just a lot of climbing.
We made it to the town of Boiling Springs and headed to a little Mexican restaurant and had dinner plus desert. All I can say is that it was pretty good although anything probably would have tasted good at that point.
I think everyone has had a good time once the heat left after day two. Not sure we would have managed if the temps had stayed in the 90’s.
It’s been fun writing my journal again and I hope you have enjoyed it.","Campsite by Trail
