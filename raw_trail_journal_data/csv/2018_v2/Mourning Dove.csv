Mourning Dove,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578799,"Once upon a time in June of 2017, I bought a book called ""One Trail, Many Paths""  I initially bought it because my nephew Ryan Holt aka ""Yukon"" had done the trail and now has a beautiful Hostel in Maine for Hikers.  He wrote chapter 4.  I started reading the book and immediately became fixated on each story of each hiker's experiences. The hiker's were all different ages and stations in life.  I wondered if I too could do it.  I read the book 3 times, and downloaded other books on my kindle.  Grandma Gatewood, Wild, A walk through the woods, and Appalachian trail guide.I posted my idea on my Facebook page and got some pretty good feedback.  It would take a lot of preparation I know but.....I couldn't get it out of my mind.  I mentioned it on my July 13th birthday to my daughter and my partner. My daughter said, ""see how you feel after you read the book and then put it away. You will probably forget about it.   My partner Diane said, ""They don't have showers or Plugs!""If I am in an environment where it is acceptable and doesn't matter what I look and smell like, I don't need a plug! It would be a treat to not have to look great everyday.   Being out in nature, and in silence sometimes is so healing for the soul.  As my sister Paula calls it Vitamin Nature.  I am still excited.My Plan is to Hike Harper's Ferry to Damascus and experience what I am reading about and hopefully meeting some really cool people that are experiencing the same.",,Pre-Hike,"Jun 10, Sat",0

Mourning Dove,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578801,"I have started a training plan to try to get into a little better shape to go longer distances.  I started doing wildlife santurary trails around my town with my new boots on.  I love the boots.  Not one sore spot or anything. Of course the most I have done so far is 5 miles with my boots on.  Once I get a bit better, I will add my pack, and think about some practice weekend or overnight hikes to practice setting up camp.Namaste",,View Entry,"Sep 01, Fri",0
Mourning Dove,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579690,"Let's see, where do I begin....I drove to Lincoln New Hamphire to Hike my first Pre-Hike with my pack.  I was with my sister Christine, her friend Laura, and my son Brandon, and we planned to hike Mt Osceola and camp at the top.  I was so excited, although hesitant as my pack weighed 32 pounds with everything. It was my chance to try out all my equipment and see how it went.  I was told that the mountain was easy to moderate.  This was the start of my nightmare.  
We started up and I thought, ""okay, this is beautiful and doable, I can do this.  4341 feet up.  It felt like it took forever!  I was drinking plenty of water,  but at about 3/4 of the way up I started losing control.  I have MS and my right leg totally stopped working on me, my heart was pounding in my ears, and i started vomiting.  I felt so awful, I sat down and tried to regain some strength to make it to the top.  I had already told my group to go ahead and I would meet them at the top.  I didn't want to feel pressure to keep up.  I imagine I looked like I was dying, as everyone was asking me if I was okay.  I was definately not okay.  The mountain was very rocky and steep and way more than I bargained for.  After a while, my son came back down, took my pack, and I somehow made it up to the summit.  I lay down on the summit for a while.  I cooled down and was told, now we have to go find a place to put our tents.  We probably walked another half mile of pure steep rock.  I don't really remember this part.  I do remember I went down on my ass the whole way. There weren't many spots to camp, and we ended up making 3 different spots that were lumpy and dense with nothing other than dead branches and mushy moss. My son helped me set up my tent and within an hour I was in my tent. I couldn't even eat anything.  It was cold, but I made it through the night. I layed there wondering, how do I get off the mountain if I am failing.   I hoped to wake up in the morning.  I did wake up, Thank God.  My son had gone back down the Mtn. because he had no camping gear, he was just joining us for the day.  He ended up getting an Air BnB, so he could come up the mountain the next mourning to help me with my pack and get back down the mountain.  I had to somehow get up a long section of trail that felt like climbing a chimney, just to get back to the summit so I could go back down to the beginning where our car was.    I somehow made it down easier than up.  My son ended up doing the mountain 4 times to help me out.  He had on timberland work boots and was no doubt was in pain at the end.  I was so thankful to him and sorry that I had to put him through this.   I was never so happy to get home to my bed that night. At that point if was thinking hell with it all.  However, once I thought about it, I knew I had chosen Harper's Ferry to Damascus for a reason.  I am not a steep rock climber.  It just doesn't work for me or my health.  With that being said, I have changed the direction of my plan.  Instead of going from Harper's Ferry to Damascus,  I will go Damascus to Harper's Ferry.  After that experience, I would be foolish to do the Roller Coaster at the beginning of my hike.  I will have to build up.  This was a nightmare experience, but I can't let it stop me.  That is my plan. As for my son, I bought him a new pair of Solomon Hiking boots.  If anyone has any tips for me on my plan of W VA and VA please message me, I would love to hear from you!",,View Entry,"Oct 14, Sat",0
Mourning Dove,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579917,"A beautiful Hike on the AT in Maine, Dunn's Falls with Family.  Nice, some sucking the wind parts, gorgeous Waterfalls. Hiked with just a Camelback. Still trying to build up climbing strength, and cardio.   I find that everyone's easy is not necessarily my easy.  I will have to definately hike my own hike.",,View Entry,"Oct 20, Fri",0
Mourning Dove,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580300,"Beautiful Fall day on the Central Rail Trail! My partner and I did a beautiful 5 mile hike, It was mostly flat with some inclines.  It is a perfect place to train because you can veer off into other sections of the Trail.  We went back the next day and did an 8 mile hike. I plan to practice more there. Next up Vermont.",,View Entry,"Nov 04, Sat",0
Mourning Dove,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580341,I am trying to move everyday in preparation for my April hike.  Today i went to Mashpee River Woodlands. I never realized how many trails are in my very own town.  I did 4 miles of a nice easy terrain today with my litle 4 pound dog.  My leg is getting stronger everyday.   Heading to Vermont this weekend for some more practice. There is beauty in every trail and everyday...,,View Entry,"Nov 07, Tue",0
Mourning Dove,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580555,"Leaving for Virginia on the 19th for Thanksgiving week.  I am hoping to check out Haprper's Ferry Trail to see what I am up against.  I am researching weather and if I read it right, Both Harper's Ferry and Damascus degrees look kind of Low. Very low.  I am not prepared for freezing temperatures on April 1st.  Anyone know of this?  Have experience with this?",,"Manassas, Virginia","Nov 19, Sun",0
