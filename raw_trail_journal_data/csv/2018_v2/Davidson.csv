Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583434,"Hi, I am Davidson. In May 2018 I am going to join my daughter who is Thru-Hiking the AT.  I hope to meet her around Shady Valley, TN and hike with her til she gets to Massie Gap. From there I am breaking off to join some friends in Grayson Highlands.  Exciting but my buds think I'll end up in Damascus ICU. :-)",,Pre-Hike 1,"Feb 26, Mon",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583438,"First my disclaimer for the blog:  I love my wife, my children and their many accomplishments.  So if this is a blog of interest to anyone, there will be some truths, and feelings that a Dad may save for a quiet padded room.  Especially in camping, kayaking, and other outdoor adventures. I am always safety minded and sometimes drive the rest nutz with preparation.  I am NOT a prepper, but I believe I can be camp ready and on the road in under an hour :-). So I often miss the adventure worrying about everyone's safety, health and comfort. So now that the disclaimer is complete, onward to Davidson's thoughts - be prepared it may be graphic :-)
 My traditional camping has been weekend backpack short distance (base camp and 5-10 mile day hikes).  Or car camping with friends.  Oh, I have taught all there is to know about Scoutcraft and camping but as far as the long 50 miles in 7 days, well this will be a bit of a challenge.  I usually have had kids with me of some sort. Whether its a scout troop of 30 or my own 6 kids and wife. It is always more stressful since you worry about their safety.  This hike is me and my daughter, but now she is 24 and on her own. So its easier, I still worry about her as a father should, but expect she has planned this hike as much as any other millennial adult.

I tried figuring out how to afford ultralight backpacking.  Getting as much gear as needed in a small amount of space.  I check prices and it seems that to fill the basics, I would be spending $1000+. Lucky for me, the great adviser - the WWW had suggested instead of buying used equipment, why not try renting the equipment.  So I found a great little outfitter called ""Outdoors Geek"" (http://www.outdoorsgeek.com), they would rent me a tent/backpack/sleeping bag/sleep pad/jetboil/water filter, etc. for a modest price < $300.  And its pretty good quality equipment including a Big Agnes Flycreek HV UL2 tent, Gregory Z65 backpack, Big Agnes Encampment 15 and a Big Agnes Air Core ultra sleep pad.  So that equipment alone far exceeds the $300 rent budget.  Again big shout out to Outdoors Geek, hope they don't disappoint ! :-)
Time to update my Gear List then everyone can tell me what to take and don't take :-)",,Pre-Hike 2,"Feb 27, Tue",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583440,"My third entry, I get posted !!  
So I needed a set of trekking poles, trail runner sneakers, and good socks to start my hiking training. The last time I did any real hiking was the 2015 Make a Wish Trailblaze Challenge, a 24.1 mile Bartram Trail Hike.  I got a crazy idea to add to the bucket list, hike 24.1 miles in one day to support terminally ill children who have a bucket wish.  My hope and donation to Make a Wish was my bucket list -- ""Do something totally selfless for another person.""  And in addition to hiking 24.1 miles uphill, a person additionally has to raise $2500 in donations (or be personally responsible - yeah they ask for a credit card).  So I did the only right thing and called my friend and former assistant Scout leader “Bud”, who I knew would push me silly to train for a big hike.
And he did, we started on a cold February morning climbing a local mountain at 6 am, its was a chilly 28F and we ascended about 1500 feet over 2.5 miles from outside the park gate to the summit of Pilot Mountain North Carolina, famous as the adaption of ""Mount Pilot"" in The Andy Griffith Show. And three months later, I successfully completed said hike in just under 14 hours, crossing 24.1 miles and completed PUDs (Plenty of UPs and Downs) peaking at Wayah Bald North Carolina, 5385 feet.
So back to the sneakers/poles/socks. Socks I found from the Carolina Mills Outlet. Merino wool with some acrylic/polyester but I got Large and should have got Medium. Good quality Browning socks.  Next, I looked for a used pair of Salomon SpeedCross 3 trail shoes, men's 10.  Well that didn't work out, great price but they arrived as Women's size 10. Ouch! so return them.  Success was the trekking poles, Amazon specials...  


Can't wait for new set of socks and sneakers, but payday ain't here yet.",,Pre-Hike 3,"Feb 28, Wed",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583755,"Getting excited for DD, she is down to just 4 weeks!!  I reserved our campsite at Amicalola Falls State Park April 6th and hiking with DD up the Approach Trail.  New shoes came in the mail. These are not the Salomon's I wanted but they are decent. A pair of Turntec Trail shoes, nice tread, hope they will work as training shoes til I can see if Salomon's are an option. As well, I ordered both a pair of Darn Tough Mediums and Injinji Toe Socks for comparison while training.
This might be gross observation but I wanted to know if the Merino Wool really did keep the smellies away. So I have been wearing the Browning socks in evening. For last 4 days. No smellies, my cotton whites stink after 8 hours, so ill include a regular day as well.
Next entry will compare Darn Tough versus Injinji socks.",,Pre-Hike 4,"Mar 07, Wed",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583852,"My Darn Tough Socks arrived in the mail.  This is the ultralight, no see edition. Darn Tough defines these socks as speed/bike/runner level and no see means right at the ankle bone.  The socks are not tight but snug.  I wear 9.5W sneakers so medium men's is rated 8-9.5. When I order the Large Brownings the size was 10-12. Which left the socks loose. So I will see if I can use the Darn Toughs as a base and the Brownings as the outer layer.  
For being ultralight no see, the merino wool really keeps the feet cozy and warm.
More to come!",,Pre-Hike 5,"Mar 09, Fri",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583988,"Hi!  On Saturday I got my pair of Oatmeal color Injinji toe socks.  I have a notorious, left big toe. It seems to ingrow the nail and gets painful.  So a regular pedicure keeps it from falling off. Needless to say when it rubs with the other toe, it is quite irritating.  I put on these toe socks and wore them a whole day with the trail shoes, which I spent Saturday night filling with Gorilla glue since the soles fell apart.  Ugh! Anyhoo the Injinjis are 60% NuWool (merino wool) so they are moisture wicking and the separate compartment kept the toes feeling healthy. It felt quite natural. So for a further test, I put on the Injinji underneath my regular cotton socks and wore them to work. The toe socks have not moved and the feeling is like not wearing two pairs of socks.

After one day no smelly either. More to come.",,Pre-Hike 6,"Mar 12, Mon",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585134,"So this week, I prepped with buying more toe socks. I bought two pairs of the base layer version in the picture. As well I got a base layer top and bottom for hiking. Getting down to wire for my daughter. April 6th, we are off to Amicalola Falls State Park. My daughter, Bud and I are camping there. She starts Saturday morning the 7th.  I hope the Bud doesn't bail cuz he has a tent camper. It would be nice for daughter not to have to sleep on ground before the big hike. But if he does bail, we will be on the ground.  I am staying to the 8th. She says she is skipping the 8.5 mile Approach Trail and instead wants to start at the Parking Lot.  So we are 4 wheeling it.


I haven't heard much about my daughter's prep for the hike.  So since she hasn't discussed food or mail drops, I invested in some dehydrated food.  The website http://www.theepicenter.com have an annual Mountain House can sale. So I bought like seven #10 cans of food. I plan to break up the food into daily servings so she has breakfast/lunch/dinner. I will send her 5-7 days of food then maildrop the remaining every so often depending on her schedule.
Not sure, but I am noticing that the time people are taking on the trail this year is a bit longer than last year.  I was hoping it should only take her 30 - 35 days to make the trip from Springer to Shady Valley or so. But I think I am misinterpreting something.  We’ll see as people progress.",,Pre Hike 7,"Mar 28, Wed",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585809,"Yay! Finally reached an excitement level.  Friday we transport my daughter to Amicalola Falls State Park.  My bud and I are taking his camper with my daughter and her dog.  She is starting the trail Saturday morning.  So our last chance to do a full shakedown is approaching fast.  Last night I spent three hours putting together dehydrated food packages.  Got 7 days of food into individual quart freezer bags and then into a one gallon ""week"" bag.  She hasn't confirmed whether she has all the food she needs, so ole Dad is prepping to assist. I hope I am wrong.  Anywho, what I did to prep was buy 7 cans of Mountain House dehydrated food.  I did get some discounts from www.theepicenter.com on Mountain House 10# cans. I bought one 10# can of ""Breakfast Skillet"" and 6 cans of chicken and meat combos for dinners.  Each quart bag was labelled ""Day 1, 2, ..."". In each bag, I put the dinner choice at the bottom (consisting of ONE cup of dehydrated food), then a protein bar, 4-5 lifesaver mints, a single packet TANG, one single packet of coffee, a single beef jerky stick and then breakfast on top (consisting of either ONE cup of Breakfast Skillet or ONE packet of instant oatmeal) and a small pak of baby wipes.  Surprisingly, one cup of dehydrated food fits in a snack size baggie.  All she has to do is boil water in her JetBoil.

She'll probably tell me she has it all covered, so in that case I'll just send her the food in the 1st mail drop, but at least it helps my anxiety.  See this is how I am, I prep for the others because I doubt they do themselves.  Its a bad parent trait.

Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585954,"Whoot!!
We are in the Amicalola State Park. We had a great day yesterday, DD partied out her anxiety, so we drove with her and her dog for 5 hours from North Carolina to Georgia while they both slept deeply. We stopped  in Franklin NC as Bud and I had enjoyed the past visit to Rock House Lodge At Outdoor 76 Mile 110 on the AT. We each had a flight of their native beers.  Then we walked down the street to Root and Barrel and enjoyed some lunch fare. 
After that, we drove to Blue Ridge GA on route 76, and Bud introduced me to Merciers Orchards, there we each enjoyed a flight of their hard ciders. And Bud picked up a dozen apple pies. A mix of Krispy Kreme and fresh baked pies. I grabbed some Black Bee Apple Cider, a unique dry apple cider.
We arrived at Amicalola around 5, trekked up to the Lodge for a late check in and then proceeded to our campsite. 
Nice evening, light rain and then the midnight pee breaks were in a intermittent heavy rain",,Amicalola Falls State Park,"Apr 06, Fri",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585975,"It's Saturday 1130 am and we aren't quite there, we're still thinking out the pack and all the parts. Bud and I are patiently assisting her as she talks through the build. We still will need to check in and get our passports signed.  Its a Dad thing to want to help, but part of the journey is holding back and waiting longer PATIENTLY 
It drives you nuts, cause you have the experience of arriving late to the campsite, and watching others get the prime spots. It teaches you a sense of urgency might help in comfort later.
We will still need to drive up the forest road to Big Stamp Gap above the start of the trail, then hike in a mile. Kiss the rock and start the walk up. At Big Stamp Gap we will have done one mile of official trail. Then its good luck and start your hike. Text me each night, so I trust you are safe. Dad anxiety continues for next three to five weeks. Will I see her, will she pass me, or will I be ahead of her in Shady Valley TN? 
Or will she have gone home and I am alone. Crossing fingers and hoping for best!!!",,Amicalola Falls Visitor Center,"Apr 07, Sat",0
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586073,"Hi! So it’s Saturday 1 pm and we are packed! Down the hill we go from Campsite 6 to the Visitors Center. We find “Thru Hiker Registration”, here we met Bob, a Forest Service Volunteer, he checked us in, stamped our passport and assigned us Hiker number 2020. We were then passed over to Master Splinter. Master Splinter is a 20 something 2012 Thru-Hiker who now works for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC). He chatted about the 10 Essentials on the trail and then demonstrated the PCT method of food hanging. It seems the bears have learned that a string tied to a tree provides a cache of treats. The PCT, Pacific Coast Trail, method allows the Hiker to toss their rope over a high limb, tie on your food bag and then attached a carabiner inline. Then pull your food up on the limb. Once that is done, reach as high as you can and tie in a stick using a marlin spike knot. Release the tension and the stick will slide up to the carabiner. This will suspend your food, while leaving the remaining rope loose. Result is no loss of food. We spent about two hours in Hiker orientation at the Visitors Center.
After leaving the visitors center at 4, we left enroute to the parking lot at Big Stamp Gap. The Approach Trail was out of scope since it would have blown today’s schedule and had not been kind to Stitch the Woofer.  It’s all metal stairs. We stopped for a quick dinner at a grocery/gas local store and then left about 515 to get to Big Stamp Gap. Another 45 minutes up a very potholed 4 wheeling road and we arrived at our destination.  Beginning with the next entry I am turning my page over to Trail since I am now starting Trail Expedition Support Staff.  I want my Hiker to be successful. And I am shooting for best supporting Dad role in a Thru-Hike movie. Wish me luck!",,Big Stamp Gap,"Apr 07, Sat",1.10
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586145,"After arriving at Big Stamp Gap at 6pm, DD and woofer geared up, along with Bud and I. We found our short southerly trail and in the thick foggy clouds, we hiked the trail south to the AT plague on the stone. The short 1.1 mile trail was uphill and mostly moist rock, but moderate in difficulty. We arrived at the rock at the Southern Terminus of the AT. We had passed a sign saying the Campsites at the Summit were no longer available and that one needed to camp by the Springer Mountain Shelter. So we headed North (where we just came from) on the trail about 150 yards. From there we found the campsites, privy and Shelter. DD decided on a site and we all hugged good luck and Good Bye!
While earlier Saturday seemed challenging, my DD held strong and I believe she is capable of making this tour of duty.  Much more to come!
My initial Dad intrepidation is slowly dissolving.","Big Stamp Gap
",Springer Mountain Trailhead,"Apr 07, Sat",-1
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586146,"Bud and I hiked from the Springer marker 0 and at the parking lot I claimed my 1st mile on the Appalachian Trail. I can’t wait to come back to the trail in May in Tennessee.
On our way home we visited Nantahala Outdoor Center. The NOC is at mile mark 137.3 of the trail. I visited with a nice proprietor of the Pizza by the River joint. She stated that the descent into the Nantahala Gorge was a remembered Thru Hiker challenge.
Later near the river, Bud and I met three Thru Hikers: Pinch, Pistol and “just Ryan” :-) Pinch and Pistol had been a couple for 3+ months and decided to hike the AT. What a way to develop your relationship.  They confirmed the pizza owners comments about the descent into NOC.  As well, we met four others, one with a pool noodle they brought to the AT. Whoever slept late got the noodle to carry on their pack for the next section of the trail. Which of course the duration is decided by the others. 
They all seemed excited about Trail Days (http://www.traildays.us/) in Damascus VA, May 16-20.
Good Luck to all 7 Thru-Hikers!","Springer Southern Terminus

Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586364,"DD reports she made it to Stover Creek shelter after resting and adjusting to her new environment.  She is excited, and Dad is busy.  It was back to work on Monday with some remaining focus on her first mail drop.  What to put in it, where will she be.On my own trek I am reminded of the challenge of the trail.  The trail can be narrow, wet and slippery. So while I have thought about boots, I am still sticking to my trail sneakers. When I used boots for the 24.1 trek they felt heavy with every uphill step. I wasn't as pained this time on the trail with the sneakers.","Springer Mountain Trailhead

Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586365,"Its Monday and while I am back to work, my mind is still focused on setting up the first maildrop. We originally talked about Suches, GA but when I looked back in AWOLs trail guide. It seemed way too close, since I gave her 5-6 days of food. She should be on trek to get to a maildrop closer to Neel Gap where Mountain Crossings Outfitter is located. So now I just got to hear from her and see if we are in sync.","Stover Creek Shelter
",Hawk Mountain,"Apr 09, Mon",5.30
Davidson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586367,"Yay!! First text since she started. I at least know she is still with us in spirit. She was leaving Hawk Mountain enroute to Gooch Mountain.  That's a bit farther in distance than Monday. If she is jumping shelter to shelter than she is falling into a good pace.  On the AT, one needs to be averaging 12-14 miles a day.  The first week, it is recommended to stick to no more than 8 miles.  The next 4-5 shelters average 8 miles apart.  Some shorter, some longer.
On the Dad side, it was Tuesday before I heard from DD.  It was good to know she was progressing forward. I was able to find a spreadsheet with rough distances, locations and estimated days to completion. Using this as a basis, and knowing her progress will give me a better schedule of when and where to send the mail drops. That's a good thing, cause the closer you are to a date the more expensive the shipping costs. If I can get estimates of arrival, most businesses will hold your package for 2 weeks until you arrive.
UPDATE:
Got a text from DD, she was helping ""...a green senior hiker (probably anyone over 45) and her 9 mo old puppy."", who ran out of water and the dog was starving.  She got them a shuttle to the local town. She got her dog more food since she had given up hers to the senior hiker, and bought herself a pizza.  So officially my DD got her heavenly wings on the trail.","Hawk Mountain

She came home for two weeks. Then she annonunced she was off to Harpers Ferry from NC via train. She is heading NoBo to Mt Katadyn.So now my hike is one of solitude and reflection. I received my gear and all of the rented equipment is in good order.  I have just finished my dinner celebrating Mothers Days with my wife, her family and her aunt. Heading shortly and hoping to start hiking this afternoon.
