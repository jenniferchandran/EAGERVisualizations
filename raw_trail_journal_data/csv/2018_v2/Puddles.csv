Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581950,"Well, 2018 is off and running, complete with the longest stretch of extreme cold weather (sub-zero) that I can recall in my decades of living here in NH. It gives me time to train indoors while cooking and dehydrating food that I will package and eat on my thru-hike. It gives me time to pause and reflect on the magnitude of my life and the abundance of people and experiences for which I am most grateful. I have a wonderful life, and my thru-hike journey is not to escape any of that, but rather to find something perhaps I haven't spent enough time looking for all of these years. Me.  
For decades I have devoted myself to the wants and needs of others. That's not a complaint, just a fact, and it worked for me all these years. I started working at 12 as a babysitter and at 15 on payroll and I have owned my own businesses since I was just 17. I've worked more hours in these years than many who are a generation older than myself. Work has been an escape of sorts for me, keeping me fully occupied mentally. I'm also a wife and mother. I've left, or taken, very little time for myself, always thinking ""there will be time later"". What if ""later"" never comes?
In 2016 illness took over and 2017 was a year of much needed healing. I'm actually thankful for the illness, as it brought me the healing which brings me to this point in my life. My previous work habits can no longer be endured. It was years ago, at our local EMS store, while buying gear for our son's first Boy Scout overnight and while standing in line at the checkout I read the back of a book....on the Appalachian Trail. I'd never heard of it prior to that, but once read...I could never forget it either. It grabbed me by the hand (and heart). I knew at that moment that ""some day"" I would hike it...all of it. 
""Some day"" is something I reflect upon differently now. Having lost 2 young, outstanding fellow business owners and pillars of community pride and support whom I called friends and had such admiration and respect for in 2017 has helped me to understand that ""some day"" must be a day that we actively choose....or it may never come. It's important for me to understand that taking time to pursuit ones dreams outside work and family is important and that I am worthy of that opportunity. 
My wonderful husband Brian and I have spoken for years about hiking the trail together. And maybe we will still plan to do that. However the gentle tug of the trail for me has become an undeniable shout and arm twist that I can not deny. And there is no doubt for me that this is ""My Turn"". With 100% unwavering support Brian will be there for me and the thought of that causes me to overflow with emotion. He'll take care of my business, along with our son, and also be my trail boss, responsible for getting me gear, drop boxes and anything else I physically need on the trail. And his emotional support will be indescribable. I'm so Blessed. I could not ask for more. 
There is much for me to do, both at home and at work to ready myself for the trail. I am up for the challenge. This is My Year, this is My Hike and this is my Courage to Heal. This is a stroll for my soul. ""Puddles""",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Sun",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581997,"Spring is in the air! Well, not really...but it's 37 and sunny today which is much improved from the nearly 2 weeks of sub zero temps and extreme wind chills we just climbed out of. And the smell of spring? Probably just what's leftover from the marshmallow I toasted over the glowing wood stove. But even if spring isn't in the air yet, it will be soon. And I'll be ready!
So as the dehydrator softly hums its lullaby in the kitchen, preparing the delicious dinners I will enjoy on the trail, I sit at a nearby computer researching gear. As any long distance hiker knows, there is a plethora of gear out there touting the virtues of making your hike lighter, faster, dryer, more comfortable, etc. And to join it is an over abundance of advise, blogs, vlogs, reviews (many by pros who are compensated for such) and of course all the social media posts. It's enough to make me feel that my head might pop off and float away in the sea of it all. 
Thankfully, before frustration set in I took some pause. I had to decide, despite all this information, on what I personally need and what selections may best fit my needs. So I made a list of items that I will need on the trail and what is important to me about each of them. Then I went to work. Some of the items we already have. So I started with those. We have a Big Agnes Copper Spur 2 that we use when we overnight together. Will it be too big for just me? Can I save weight? Should I look for something lighter that I can set up with my trekking poles? What about a tarp? Or relying on shelters? I decided that I'm seeking solitude and I prefer a tent over shelters. It would be nice not to hear snoring in the middle of the night (my cat snores! And maybe Brian...a little). So a tent it is. I decided to bring the Copper Spur 2 for a few reasons. I love the tent. Its roomy enough for me to spread out in with my gear, I can sit up in it, its free standing and it will keep me dry and the bugs out. Sure, I could shave a little weight by choosing something else. But I like my tent. I did upgrade my backpack, since I was using an aged and very good condition EMS pack that we purchased all those years ago for our Boy Scout son. Built for a man, not a women which makes a difference in the shoulder straps. And I must say the experts at REI were super kind and helpful in properly fitting me for my new pack (Osprey Aura). I'll keep my Enlightened Equipment 20 degree quilt because that is also tested and proven and I can't beat the light weight. I took a look at my cooking set next...and it's for 2 people. So I modified that by purchasing a Snow Peak mug that doubles as a pot for boiling water and a measuring cup. It's perfect for 1 person and I can leave the bowl and mug set at home, a huge weight saving. But I'll keep my beloved MSR Pocket Rocket!
Now for the footwear. I'm not a shoe collector. I know, that may sound odd to you but I'm really not. I have however now amassed quite a selection of hiking footwear which appears as a small army of them lined up diligently waiting for orders. By far this has been the more difficult part of gear for me. I have suffered from the dreaded Plantar Fasciitis (PF) twice before. The worst episode while hiking in the Tetons. I want to be sure that my footwear choice prevents the PF from rearing its ugly head like a snake bite on the trail. I wish I could bring all of the members of my new army with me, but I know that isn't possible. So, until I leave for Harper's Ferry I will wear each one. I will wear them while working out, on practice hikes and just because. I'll work out with my pack on, walk the rocky and root sprinkled trails in NH and determine which one gets to come along. I will pack my backpack and take it with me on workouts and hikes, and when I finish I will unpack it in my basement ""camp site"" where I will set up my tent. I will need to be confident and proficient in doing this by myself. I'll have to do it nearly every day for 6 months, while I'm cold, getting rained on, in the dark and being chased by ravenous mosquitoes. Packing and unpacking will help me organize things the way I want them for ease of use and develop a familiar system that works for me. I'm an organized person, and I know I can not deal with the ""exploding backpack"" some hikers utilize. 
There's much to do before April. More training, more meals to cook and drop shipments to pack. I need to be sure the wonderful agents at my office are comfortable and confident and the Broker in charge is ready. Thinking ahead to the tasks that will need to be completed in my absence and preparing them for that as well as possible. And there is the new season of the Bachelor that needs to be watched!",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Tue",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582169,"It is another snowy day here in NH and I generally dislike the snow, however I see some benefit to it this year. I know, that' even hard for  ME to believe! In getting myself physically prepared to thru hike the AT, or at least as much as is possible for me to prepare in advance, I actually have been using the inclement weather as a fitness opportunity. I can see the irony in how I used to think of going out to shovel, such a chore! Back aching work! But this year I feel a bit welcoming to the opportunity to get my exercise in while being productive and purposeful at the same time. Not that it doesn't still come with the back ache, mind you.I've evolved. Many years ago, my son referred to me as a ""Gym Rat"". I was offended by it, but I really did spend time at the gym 5 days a week and for a couple of years had a personal trainer who whooped my butt 3 days a week before sunrise. I would do another 45 minutes on my treadmill at home after Kyle went to bed each night. I walked in the mornings before work when I wasn't at the gym. And then I guess I just burned out. I haven't stepped foot in a fitness center in probably 9-10 years. And my cross trainer at home sat so idle in its devoted room that Brian actually removed the detachable power cord so he didn't have to vacuum around it...and the cord was missing for a long, long time. Misplaced. We finally had to order a new one. For that long, long time I could not motivate myself to spend even 20 minutes on that machine. The only physical activity I squeezed into my insane work week was an occasional Sunday hike, 2 mile walk from the office at lunch and evening strolls with the dog and Brian. Sad but true. My how things have changed! I now look forward to shoveling, have been snowshoeing with my pack on, walking up and down the same set of stairs for 20-30 minutes, breezing thru sets of walking lunges back and forth across the house and 60 minutes on the cross trainer doesn't seem like enough! I am looking forward to being stronger and having more endurance on the trail. But the more important thing that I am receiving from my new exercise regiment is the realization that my mind and my determination are far more powerful than I thought. These exact tools will help me carry myself over more than 2,000 trail miles and countless ups and downs, physically and emotionally. And I will be ready to meet this challenge, head on!",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Wed",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582578,"It seemed impossible to pass up the chance to be outside with the great weather we had in NH this past weekend and I was thinking late in the week about how I could carve out the time and what activity I'd prefer in the predicted mid 40's weather, complete with a glowing golden globe in the sky. So on Friday when my Niece Laura asked me if I would like to take a hike with her over the weekend...it was an invitation I couldn't refuse. Knowing what the weather had been here recently (raining ice for days) I made a trip to the EMS store on Saturday after my last appointment to pick up the Smartwool base layer I couldn't bring myself to buy the last time I was there (I just wasn't sure I could get over the sticker shock) and a pair of Micro Spikes. I tucked the receipt in the box, thinking that it might be overkill on the purchase of spikes and if I didn't use them I would simply return them. I've always managed with my Yaktrax. On Sunday morning I slipped into my Smartwool and resisted the urge to crawl back in bed. At least now I am 100% certain of my sleepwear on the trail and I can justify every penny I spent on them! They might be the most comfortable things my skin has ever felt.So while Brian stayed behind dehydrating some homemade shepherd's pie and packaging the meals up for me, Laura and I packed our gear and lunch (PB & J) and headed out to Holderness for a hike up both East and West Rattlesnake. We arrived at the trail head and there were 3 or 4 other cars there, and several more across the street at the parking area for Mt Percival and Morgan, one of our favorite hikes! The parking area was an incredibly thick blanket of ice. With Laura's urging I promptly tossed aside the Yaktrax in favor of the Micro Spikes and found them immediately to be an almost luxurious feeling of confidence and security underfoot. Another justified purchase. I was so excited to get hiking that I threw on my pack and without even stretching we started out toward the trail, stopping to say hello to 2 beautiful dogs who were completely happy to be out for their Sunday journey. They reminded me a bit of our late dog Snickers, who would exhibit such excitement when we stopped at a trail head that she would often be bouncing around in the back of the SUV before we could let her out to go sprinting down the trail, looking back as if urging us to hurry up and follow. She was a great hiker, even if she resented carrying her own little pack. I don't know how she knew a trail head from any other place, but she certainly did.The day was as promised, in the mid 40's but breezy and an overcast that filtered the sun quite nicely to prevent becoming snow blind. The trail was often as thick a blanket of ice as the parking area, but I had 100% confidence in my footing. We enjoyed a great hike, stopped for a snack and later for lunch on the return overlooking the frozen Squam Lake below. It was a different perspective, since I've only taken this hike in warmer months. It was so tranquil below it seemed. Cabins and lake homes completely shielded in the summer now visible thru bare trees. Ice skaters, ice fishing, snow mobiles and the occasional vehicle on the ice below. Far different from the boats and general business of the lake in the summer. It was wonderful to see it this way. If it weren't for the cold wind, I could have stayed much longer enjoying the peace.I absolutely love hiking with Laura. She's a wonderful person and one of my favorite hiking companions. Easy and quiet, never rushed and we have a similar pace but never hesitate to hike a bit apart for solitude either. Always great company and conversation on the rides to and from the trails as well. I'm pleased that she's always willing to hike with me, a very lucky Aunt. On the ride home we settled on our next 2 hikes. Mount Monadnock, which tried to kill me in 2016 (okay, so that's just how it felt to me at the time) and an overnight on the Squam Range Traverse where we'll summit 7 peaks in about 14 miles and backcountry camp for a night. We'll save this one for April and it will be my shakedown hike and last of my gear testing before I leave for Harper's Ferry. Laura will join me on some sections in New England and it will be great to have her company and to catch up. For now, I will just continue to think spring!",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Tue",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583008,"Feeling the ""need"" to hike the AT this year comes easy...I really can't help it, it just speaks louder and louder to my heart until I can't ignore it. But making the choice to listen to it and obey its demands is altogether another story. I own a small business. A Successful Real Estate Brokerage with a team of 5. I love what I do and our clients mean the world to me, each and every one of them, even if many of them don't realize it. Thus deciding to leave for 6 months was an agonizing decision for me. So many questions and so much uncertainty initially circled in my head and kept me awake for hours at night with feelings of selfishness and guilt for having the want and the need to take this time for myself. Can I leave this behind for 6 months?At a recent team meeting I shared my struggles and concerns. The support I received from my team that morning and every single day since is so incredibly heartwarming and I feel so blessed and loved. I could not do this without them, not in a million years. I don't know how to adequately express how I feel about their support. The best I can say is that I feel like my heart is overflowing. I hope I make them proud out there!I'll be writing for the little hand delivered paper in our local communities and I hope that people who read it, enjoy it. If it were me reading one of my neighbors adventures, I think I would find that cool as heck!11 Weeks remain before I leave for Harper's Ferry and the Flip Flop Festival. Sometimes that seems like a long time and other days it feels like tomorrow, with so much to do in between. Either way, I'll be ready! Thanks to those who read this journal and write tips and words of encouragement and the support of my wonderful family at home and at the office!",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Fri",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584535,"I took a week off training. I fell 2 weeks ago on snow covered ice in a clients driveway. While the yaktrax and microspikes in my nearby vehicle laughed at me, my first thought was that I hope no one saw me splayed out on the ground! I mean really, I don't know how I allowed myself to be tricked by snow covered ice after living in New England all my life. That stuff is like baby powder on a marble floor and I know better. The second thought came after standing up and recounting the position my left leg was in and the slight twinge in my knee. No visible bruising, I worked out as usual the rest of the week but when the mild pain didn't subside I decided to rest for a week. I'm glad I did and it feels better. But getting back on the cross trainer today meant a workout that was harder than I remember. Still, it feels great to have accomplished it and I'm already looking forward to tomorrow. I know from social media, journals, etc., that I am not the only one concerned about getting hurt before starting the trail. So I will have to be more diligent about spying that Ninja ice so I don't get my butt kicked. There's a lot of ""suck"" to embrace on the trail and I don't want to have to try to embrace anything that would end my hike before it starts!Back on the food prep home front my order came in from Thrive, Untapped and Honey Stinger. Yummy natural energy snacks and my supplements. So I bagged up 6 weeks of my supplements last night and felt pretty accomplished. My dehydrated meals are growing in number and my wonderful Husband surprised me with a new freezer to store them all in. He also ordered my Spot, knife and a few other small items on my list, which is getting smaller by the day.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Fri",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584539,"Time has been catching up with me and when I look over my shoulder I realize that in less than 6 short weeks I will be stepping foot on the AT to begin this amazing and exciting journey. When I stop to catch my breath and ponder it over it fills me with joy, anticipation and excitement as well as a sense of urgency to be 100% ready. We took a 10 day vacation to Hawaii in between training and food prepping. It was wonderful to be in the mountains there hiking. A particularly steep ascent aided by ropes really helped me to feel accomplished in my training. I felt very strong and able, yet at the same time I earned every bead of sweat that dripped from me. It was fun to share the adventure with Brian, and we both longed for more time there for trail exploration. What a wonderful island Oahu is. Now it's back to NH and back to training and food prep. I was able to cook some meals, run the dehydrator and add 9 more dinners to the growing collection. Later this week we will make the post office run to pick up some boxes that will be packed and ready to ship as needed. This way we can reclaim the dining room table which has become my staging area for snacks and dehydrated ingredients for meal prep.We've packed my pack and estimate that I will be around 31 pounds with 2 liters of water and 5 days of food. I'm satisfied with that and have been training with almost that much weight. I'm certainly looking forward to getting outside for the training without having to wade thru snow! So bring on the spring!",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Tue",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586296,"I can hardly believe that it is already April 10th and yet we still don't have spring weather yet. Seems impossible to remember an April so cold. I hiked yesterday a good portion of the auto road at Rollins State Park which leads to the trail head for Mt Kearsarge. I only had 2 hours in between appointments, so I wanted to make the best of it. I changed my clothes in the brisk but sunny afternoon air and slid into my pack for the ascent. It is steep and winding with occasional views. A short way up I was delighted to find that there was an open (and clean) privy! I was the only one in the park at the time. It was peaceful and beautiful though the road was still snow packed and I could see the many footprints (4 legged included) which had ventured in before me at other times. I never thought that I would listen to music while hiking. But being alone in the woods in the season of awakening bears made me a bit ""thoughtful"" of making my presence known. So I turned on Pandora and slid my phone into the pocket of my skirt and enjoyed the ""new""country music playlist. I saw no large animals or tracks, but a few playful and chubby squirrels and chippy's darting about along the edges of the road as I hiked. I was thrilled with the elevation to be honest. Working out indoors for the winter with a few snowshoeing excursions and a few treks up Oak Hill in Concord didn't really do much for getting me excited about climbing. I thought about how it would have been impossible for me to walk that road a year or two ago even without my pack. I feel so strong and so happy at this chapter in my life, physically and mentally. I realize I will need 100% of both on my upcoming journey and I feel 99% ready. I stopped at a wayside pullout and took a selfie of the view behind me. It makes me yearn for longer arms! I'm wondering how I can turn my hiking pole into a selfie stick. There must be a way, so I will have to research that. I had to turn around before reaching the top because I needed to be on time for my next appointment, but I really wanted to complete the road. On the way down I was so exhilarated that I found myself singing and doing a little dance on the few level sections. The grade downhill can be tough on the knees, which I am cognoscente of. So I practiced using the large leg muscles, instead of jarring my knee joints, by keeping soft knees. Very effective and I have no knee pain today. I also took 2 ibuprofen before bed just to be sure I could sleep thru the night without being awakened by joint pain. A refreshing nights sleep it was!  I learned before this road trek yesterday that this auto road is used by some to train for the annual run up the Mt Washington Auto Road. While I don't see myself ever doing that I do look forward to hiking the entire road, which is 7 miles round trip, a few times before my departure for Harper's Ferry on the 27th. I can't wait to see what's at the top and the accomplishment I will feel when I complete it the first time. I hope to see some changes in the weather too, perhaps the snow pack will melt off the road and some buds will burst open with their tiny ""new green"" leaves and the scent of spring. More woodland creatures will come out to play soon and the song of the arriving migrant birds will fill my ears with music. Spring is a time of renewal, rebirth and hope. Most all of my food is dehydrated and packaged up and several boxes are packed with assorted items to be shipped to me on trail by my wonderful husband. Our dining room plays a different role these days! My heart overflows with joy when I think of the level of Brian's support and devotion to me and I am reminded of how truly blessed I am. Life is wonderful! I'm looking forward to a final shake down hike with my Niece Laura the 21st and 22nd and stealing dinner dates with friends and family along with Brian so that we can see as many as possible before I leave. We hosted our friends Glen and Linda this past weekend and they made homemade baked beans, which are in the dehydrator now. I cherish the fact that I will enjoy those on trail along with sweet thoughts of such wonderful people and I will not feel alone. My heart is full.",,View Entry,"Apr 10, Tue",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586799,"In my mind hearing 12 days is different from seeing it in type. It feels so vivid in the written form, so real and solid. Wow! On Wed I left work at 3 and hiked the entire 7 mile round trip auto road to Mount Kearsarge from the gate at Rollins State Park. Nearly 1,800' of elevation gain and an average of 8.7% grade gives me a good idea now of my hiking speed and how my body reacts to that kind of hike with a pack (minus the water bladder). My calves were tight so I wore my compression socks to bed and have been diligent about stretching. I'll do all I can to avoid Plantar Fasciitis again and I know that my calves and hamstrings need stretching often. Yoga has been a blessing and I will practice on the trail every day! I don't care how fast or slow I hike, that isn't a focus for me, but it is important to be able to judge the right locations and times for my packages to be shipped to me. I don't want to wait around in town for a package to be delivered if I arrive days before it. Being able to use this hike to gauge my current speed will help in planning for Brian, if he doesn't forget, which I hope he's only kidding about! I do tease him that he seems to use my brain a lot...when he forgets things. Sometimes I can be faster than google and he doesn't have to type! This morning was an errand run with Brian to Walmart for some last minute items. I have been using Nido in my oatmeal and other meals and I have been ordering it online but I always run out. I was delighted when Brian found it at Walmart! With the last minute items I was able to spend my last day in the kitchen cooking meals that will be dehydrated this week. The freezer is almost full. My absolute favorite meal is an Epicurious recipe for a chicken chili with white beans. I have made a few batches over the past several months and just like this time only half makes it to the dehydrator. It appears to be one of Brian's favorites too! I wonder if he will miss my cooking. I try to imagine what his days and nights will be like without me home. When I tell people that I am hiking the AT they have many questions and some have fears for me. Ironically their fears are not the same as mine. They want to know if I will be armed, if I'm afraid of the people I will meet, animals or getting lost. I'm actually not in fear of any of those things. My fear is thunderstorms. Yup. Any natural flash of light more powerful than a firefly is terrifying for me. TERRIFYING. Those close to me know how this impacts me. To even take a summer stroll when the soundless heat lightning is flickering in the distance is dramatic. To say I startle easily at distant flashes might be an understatement. With some professional help I am trying to tackle this fear and to scale it back to manageable. This past week I started reading about thunderstorms online and I will follow up by watching video and listening with the volume up so that I can retrain myself to feel differently in the situation. Of course my preference would be not to get caught out in one, but that may not always be realistic. I have the AT weather app on my phone, and this will help me in terms of avoiding some days with forecast storms but there may be days with a low chance of storms where I choose to hike, and I will need to be able to calm myself. Historically for me knowledge has given me power and I will try that power play with this also. Please pray for my success.  I will plan to hike Kearsarage at least twice more before leaving for Harper's Ferry. Getting my calves adjusted to hours of incline hiking is good. Next weekend is my overnight shakedown hike with Laura and I sure hope spring gets here before then! Ice falling from the sky today and temps in the 20's certainly has the woodland creatures and we NH humans a bit disgruntled. I'm holding out the hope that spring prevails!",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Sun",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588019,"I took another hike up the Kearsarge auto road today. It was about 45 degrees, partly sunny and breezy making it pretty chilly. Today was different in that there was a car near the gate and a DOT van that pulled up as I was getting ready to head up. I bundled up in my wool hiking top, a lightweight fleece, wool beanie and fleece mittens. I took advantage of the open privy not far from the gate and began on my way. As with some women of a certain age, I can warm up in a flash. but not a quarter mile into the climb I was so overcome by it that I couldn't rip off the hat and gloves fast enough! I think I will find more comfort in starting cold than staring warm on the trail. Lesson learned. 
Today was different in other ways too. Some days are just harder than others and I felt like it was taking more effort for me to get into the zone and make this 7 mile trip. It doesn't help that I have a time constraint when I am out hiking. I generally have a window of opportunity and need to be at an appointment somewhere else on time, in my work clothes and without a 30 pound pack on my back. Not to mention my phone rings and dings with email, text and calls....because I am still working. It's distracting when I just want to focus on the beauty around me and take joy in the pleasure of hiking. It makes me wonder what it will be like to have nothing but hiking and caring for myself to do when I am on trail and I am looking forward to trying that out!
As I mentioned, there were people here today. I'm used to having this mountain to myself and today I was sharing with strangers. Not long after I stripped off the extra layers I felt the ""presence"" of someone. We've all had that feeling. I turned and looked down the road and saw a man carrying a jacket in one hand headed up. I didn't expect to have any feeling about that, but I suddenly felt vulnerable. I did a mental assessment of where I keep certain things, in case I need them. Such as what side my whistle is on, where is my pocket knife, etc. I stopped to the side for a drink of water and allowed him to pass felling more comfortable that he was in front of me and noted his features, the water bottle on his right hip and of course the leather sheath on his left hip which contained a knife larger than my little pocket knife. I continued up a minute after him and a woman older than me was jogging down, smiling. While I was struggling with it not being my easy day, I though heck....she just ran this 7 miles and if she can do that I sure as heck can walk it even if I don't feel peppy. And so onward I went. The man turned around not long after that and headed back down. I didn't see him again. 
I stopped for lunch at the half way point, ate my PB&J standing and without a break continued my trek. I was reminded by my stomach how important it is to relax and allow it time to do its work before I ask my body press on. The body doesn't do well digesting and exercise at the same time, or at least mine doesn't. Taking time for these things is how I want to practice my self care on the trail. At home I eat and work at the same time, sometimes all 3 meals of the day. On trail I will make it a point to stop and enjoy each one of them and actually feel the nourishment, physically and emotionally and take note of the beauty around me. 
I completed my round trip while 2 couples hiking separately were headed up. It was a successful day after all and I felt good. I thought I would be hiking on the bare road, but since the snowstorm last weekend had dumped additional snow upon the mountain there was actually more snow cover than the week before. I won't make another trek up before I leave for WV. But the mountain has been good to me for training, more than just physically.",,View Entry,"Apr 18, Wed",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588026,"There's no better place to get accustomed to hiking than in NH and I have hiked this state for years. I love it! I'm amazed and the availability of easy to get to backcountry camping we have here in this gorgeous state. Often times the most difficult challenge is deciding where to go. My niece Laura and I planned to do a 13 mile 1 night shake down on the Squam Range Traverse which uses the Crawford Ridge Pole trail, among others and traverses several peaks. We left Saturday morning around 9 very excited and took 2 vehicles up to Holderness so that we could drop one at the end and drive to where we would start our hike near Beede Falls. When we arrived at the trailhead for Mt Cotton the lot was open but there was a large ""Trails Closed"" sign there. We decided we would drive a few miles up the road to about the middle of our route and see what the trailhead for  Mounts Percival and Morgan offered. Upon arrival we saw that the lots were closed, as was Rattlesnake across the street and we knew we would need a change of plans. We decided we would both drive further north to Lincoln, stop at the ranger station and see what trails were open that we could get out into the backcountry on and take our overnight there. The ranger at Lincoln was super kind and helpful, a very nice woman. After chatting for a few minutes with her we took her suggestion of making our way to the Lincoln Woods parking area and hiking 3 miles out on the East Side trail to Franconia tent sites. It was a gorgeous and sunny day, lots of people in the lot there but most were taking the Lincoln Woods trail across the suspension bridge to the other side of the river. It's beautiful out in the Pemigewasset Wilderness and if you haven't been its a place a beauty not to be missed. While it was a much shorter hike than we had planned for and there was no elevation, the several feet of existing snow pack that had partially melted from the warm sun made it an excellent workout. It was like walking 3 miles on the beach...in soft sand. If we didn't stay on the center of the path which was compacted we would end up post-holing and sometimes thigh deep. It was much colder out in the Pemi Wilderness and with deeper snow pack than we were wishing for. My legs are bruised and Laura's calves were burning the next morning. We arrived at the tent sites to find and open privy (bonus!) and a bear box where unfortunately hikers had left behind their trash. This disturbs me. It's not that difficult to follow leave no trace principles and to hike out your own trash. When the staff arrives out there this spring they will be tasked with having to clean up after careless hikers. The only good part of this is that its in a bear box and the wildlife won't be impacted. There are 18 sites out here but not one was reachable due to the depth of the snow. We tried. We made our way over toward the river and hugged the treeline, found a decent level spot and trampled an area to compact for our camp spot. We set up camp on a compacted base layer that was still a few feet deep. Because it was difficult to make way to the river (post-holing) we opted to filter the water from melting snow that had pooled at the base of a tree. Perfect! I mastered the PCT bear bag hanging and hope this skill carries over to the AT so as to not embarrass myself should any other hikers be watching. We made dinner and had an early night getting layered up and crawling into out bags to stay warm. I have a EE 20 degree quilt that I LOVE. With my layers I was warm most of the night which was cold and clear, slightly breezy in the mid 20's. I tested the new neo air pad it I'm happy with that too. Not my finest nights sleep but certainly more than I got on an overnight flight back from Hawaii in March! The most annoying thing was that my wool beanie falls off when I sleep. I'm a side sleeper and I turn a lot. I feel like I need a bonnet with a chin strap. However does one deal with that annoyance? I've never heard another hiker complain about that, except Laura who was equally irritated by it. The night was quiet, beautifully so. Around 3am I left the tent and looked up at the sky. No light pollution. Just millions of beautiful stars. Amazing actually. The sound of the river and the magnificence of all those stars and a brightly lit moon. It was a perfect night despite the cold.  We woke just before sunrise and Laura made it out of the tent in time to walk on the now thoroughly frozen snow to a bend in the river where she caught site of the sun as it rose thru the trees. It provided a gloriously shimmering and twinkling show on the snow as if someone has sprinkled it overnight with the glitter from a Hallmark card. (we've all been glitter bombed by one of those) It's etched in my mind. I would totally do that again and I'm glad things went the way they did. It was a quicker walk back the 3 miles to the lot since the trail was now frozen and easier to walk. We enjoyed a bagel down the street before making our way back home. I am truly blessed to have Laura in my life. She could have been in her warm bed but she chose to support me and brave this crazy spring/still winter overnight with me. I'm extremely grateful for her!",,View Entry,"Apr 22, Sun",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588223,"Last Saturday night, awake in my tent at 3am after a trip outside to admire the moonlight and starry night, I has a few moments of sadness, thinking about Brian back home. We've never been apart for more than a week. How would this feel for us both. Those moments seemed to set the scene for my entire week. It seems to me I should be filled with joy and happiness, anticipation of this wonderful journey, and I am. Sometimes. But this week felt more like my emotions were controlled by a slot machine. You know, the 1 armed bandit with the three rows that spin. It was as if my emotions were those three rows and several times a day someone would pull the arm down and let me spin out of control until I landed on different feelings such as fear, guilt, doubt. And it would spin again and I'd find excitement, anticipation, happiness. I'm exhausted! At 6:30 last night when I locked up the office I was unexpectedly overcome and couldn't hold back my tears. Brian held me, chuckled and encouraged me that this will pass and I'm doing the right thing. This evening I feel that way. But it was a long day on the road to get to Harper's Ferry and the day didn't start right. In his final check of my credit card before departing Brian noticed a charge from a motorsport company. Strange that I would make a large purchase without consulting him he asked me to come look. Of course it wasn't mine, and unless I can be in 2 places at once neither was dinner and the movie also on my bill.  A lot of my time in the car was spent on the phone with the business owner, sheriff and bank. All is well, thanks to Brian's quick thinking, the sheriff and business owner. There's at least one criminal with new bracelets tonight!In the midst of that, my black SUV which we had freshly painted just last year is going to have a return trip to the shop while I'm away. Thank you Mr truck driver for the new red paint we now sport half way down the driver's side. I love NY!Just when I asked if this was a sign that I shouldn't be doing this I glanced to my right and written above the driver's door of another truck was ""God really exists"". Just last night I prayed that he would guide me and continue to keep myself and my Loved ones safe and healthy. I asked for comfort that I was doing the right thing. Thank you for the sign God. I'm doing the right thing and I'm looking forward to it!!",,View Entry,"Apr 27, Fri",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588318,"It was an interesting night in Harper's Ferry. We checked into our B&B, a lovely old building with wonderful hosts Chris and Liesel. We were tired, hungry and as it was already 8:30 most shops and restaurants were already closed. We ventured a mile up the street by car, because we hadn't had enough of that yet, so we could make it to the last known open restaurant nearby. We enjoyed a steak (should have shared one!) and ventured back to the room to turn in for the night. I saw the small ornamental dish on the night stand and it had 2 packages of ear plugs. I recalled how I'd read that many hikers sleep with with ear plugs in shelters and hostels because some hikers snore, the sleeping pads make noise, etc. I was impressed thinking how these wonderful and kind innkeeper thought of everything hiker related. I was kind of wrong. I'll explain this in one short word. TRAIN. In case you haven't been to Harper's Ferry, like us, you may not know about the train(s). Several of them, which run day AND NIGHT. The train station happens to be, yes you guessed it, right across the street from the balcony of our room. 
Brian utilized said ear plugs. 
I can't say enough positive things about this town and it's people however, and I think the train will grow on me too. Never have I felt so comfortable, welcomed and included in a place where I'm a total stranger. I'm in awe of how different this environment is and how genuine and generous everyone here is. The staff and volunteers at the ATC as well as local merchants have all been warm and genuinely engaging. We enjoyed the workshops and the celebration which was held at The Barn. But as the festivities settled down I asked Brian if we could depart. I was craving quiet alone time with him to enjoy a bit of each other and this town. 
I walked back from pizza at 10pm by myself as Brian drove the truck back. I wanted to get the exercise and feel the evening. It was peaceful and the town is sleepy in the evening. Most of the house lights are off and shops and restaurants are all closed. The temperature was in the mid 50's with a breeze, very comfortable. I love these old civil war era buildings. There's so much history here. This town has a big story. I already know I can't wait to come back and learn it. But I also know my return will have to be by way of Katahdin.",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Sat",0
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588827,"The day has finally arrived! After a 1/2 mile walk up the hill we met the remaining flip floppers who were attending the send off at the Conservancy around 9am. Appalachian Trail Conservancy staff and volunteers were all so genuinely excited for each of us. Hansel and Gretel, Brian and I, Reed and a few other hikers were present, even River who wasn't leaving until the next day was there to support the group. I had the first stamps in my AT passport completed, a flip flop stamp and ATC. I also received a pin from the maker of the passport which Laurie Pottigier pinned on my pack along with my thru hiker tag. I felt very special and very ready. It was then photo opp time, which made me anxious because I just wanted to get to the party ( much like when your wedding photos are being done and you just want to get to the reception!) 
Brian and I and Reed opted for the scenic historic route, past Storer College, the cemetery and Jefferson Rock. The view over Harper's Ferry and the Patomic was stunning and now etched in my brain. 
The day began easy, with a walk along the canal and river on a wide section of trail until it crossed the railroad tracks and headed uphill to Weaverton Cliffs. Our first real taste of the AT. The day was warm, in the 70's after a very cool start. It was no joke climbing up Weaverton Cliffs. We we're passed by nobo thru hikers Fireman, Research and a couple of others who stopped for a moment to chat and were wonderfully encouraging. By this time Reed who was much younger had gone ahead. Our plan was to hike 7.6 miles and stay at Ed Garvey shelter. We made it to camp around 2:30 and were tired but not spent. I suggested we push on 4 miles to the next shelter but Brian made me promise to keep my word on going slow in the start. So we set up camp on a nice site and enjoyed dinner together. We were in our tent by 7:30pm and it was lights out. So much excitement for the day and Brian hadn't slept well the night before. Tomorrow we plan for a 10 mile day.","Harper's Ferry Appalachian Trail Conservancy

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588844,"There's a lot of talk about the rocks in Pennsylvania. But let me just share with you Maryland has no trouble showing off her rocks! And I'm not talking about diamonds! Today was a tough day. It was very hot today in the high 80s, and while you might think that we're hiking through the green tunnel the leaves haven't actually appeared yet. So with the sun overhead even though we're walking in the forest there's absolutely no shade to be found anywhere. With 70 proof sunblock on we still managed to get burned. We sweat so much that the sunblock kept running down and stinging our eyes, it looked like we were crying. 
We started out with one and a half liters of water each and refilled at Gathland State Park where we were also able to charge phones, use the restroom and wash with soap. And we got rid of our trash, which is very nice!  We just couldn't drink enough water today.  We noticed that even though we continued to drink all day we hadn't peed since our early stop at Gathland. Very unusual for me, I'm generally a peeing machine! 
The Rock's just pounded our feet all day and in the small sections where we were able to hike on smooth dirt it was like walking on pillows! We prayed for more but the rocks just kept coming. 
We had to stop several times to rest and cool down. We sat alongside the trail on a barely shaded log and enjoyed some lunch. When Traveling Ambassador approached us, we were ready to leave and we gave up our very small Shady spot so that she could sit and relax for a few minutes and rest. She's hauling an extremely heavy pack, and she's just the sweetest woman from London, a joy to talk with and I don't know how she presses on with that pack weight but she does. .
The Heat and the constant relentless sun have really been trying. We're asking our bodies to do something that they've never done before, haul a 36-pound pack up and down mountains. It feels much like carrying a small house on your back. I can tell you that two days in I already have a list of items from my pack that I'll be sending home! They may not amount to much weight, but they do take up space and every ounce makes a difference. Also it takes a few days to dial in the adjustments so your pack rides comfortably. Of course it doesn't help that Brian was carrying a rock in the rock sack for his bear bag. I guess he must have felt it was very special to have a rock from NH. 
We found the hills and the rocks to be so relentless that we devised a plan where we would count steps 10 or 15 or 20 steps, whatever we needed and we would then take a rest for two or three breaths until we proceeded for another 10 20 30 steps whatever the case. It seemed to work well and although it felt like we were crawling we were able to manage the Heat.
By the time we rolled into Rocky Run Shelter it was close to 5pm. I proceeded directly to the spring, so that we could get some much-needed water and rehydrate ourselves. It was an absolute blessing to be able to stand with our feet in the Cold Spring to soothe them. While we were filtering water Traveling Ambassador came through the camp, she wasn't staying but she had run out of water as well and she was in serious need. I had my filter there so I pumped 2 liters of water and watched her drink one and then refilled again for her. She was not staying at Rocky Run, but going to miles further north to Dahlgren Backpackers Campground which has running water and showers.
A couple from New York who we had met earlier in the day were also camped out at Rocky Run. There were just a few people there, a father hiking with his daughter, a single gentleman in the shelter, the couple from New York who we call the dynamic duo and another father daughter duo who we also met earlier in the day. It was a pretty quiet evening, we hung our bear bags and again we were in bed sometime between 7:30 and 8 a.m (hiker midnight) feeling much refreshed from rehydrating. As I lay there however I told Brian I felt like someone had pummeled my feet with a hammer. I took two Advil and tried to drift off to sleep. Sleep came difficult for both of us neither one of us had a good night's rest, it was very hot and one of the neighboring tents had a snorer. In addition to that after dark someone came down with a headlamp to hang a bear bag on the pole, and couldn't master it so there was 10 minutes of clinking and clanging as they were trying to get their bag hung.
I forgot to mention yesterday that I received my first trail magic! When we arrived at Ed Garvey shelter seriously low on water I was going to head .4 miles down a steep trail to the spring to get some. When a day hiker who was at the shelter realized this he called me over and gave us all his water. I was hesitant to take it all but he was hiking down hill and lived not far. When I thanked him for the trail magic he was really touched that I called it that. It meant something to him to provide trail magic to a thru hiker.","Ed Garvey shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589027,"After a restless night of sleep and the realization that a 2 person backpacking tent is really small for 2 people I heard our neighor up and about and figured that gave me permission. I woke Brian by opening the valve to release the air from my sleeping pad. Unimpressed as he was, he understood. I'd expressed the night before that I really wanted to hike as early as possible and get in as many miles as we could before the sun came at us for another beating. It was 5:45am. We packed up, filtered water and walked out of camp by 7:30. I've been wearing injinji sock liners and smart wool socks. The combination has worked to keep me blister free on all other hikes. But I was intrigued by Wright socks, and thus I bought a pair and today I tried them out. I wish now I hadn't. By the time we were half way to Dahlgren Backpackers campground I could feel a hot spot on one of the toes on my right foot. Upon arrival at the campground which is 1.8 miles from Rocky Run it was in fact my first blister. We stopped at Dahlgren to have breakfast, take advantage of a free hot shower, charge electronics and get rid of trash. Traveling Ambassador was there and we got to chat a few minutes. She was heading to town to get to a post office where she could mail some of her items ahead on the trail and reduce her pack weight. We stayed about an hour and a half and it was already well into the 70's when we hit the trail again. It became hot very fast, again without any shade. We made our first road crossing and saw a beautiful stone Church and Inn across from each other. Peaceful setting and a small field to walk thru. There was a hiker napping under the only shade tree available. We climbed a bit and eventually came across another road and into Washington Monument Park. Hot and needing a water resupply we stopped and found a partly shaded picnic table next to rest rooms and cold water. We snacked and rested, hydrated and moved on once the little shade we had moved  on too.  We pressed up a climb and eventually came upon the park's namesake...the original Washington Monument. A stone structure with magnificent view of Washington County. We were so hot and cranky. Brian had been complaining and it just made the situation feel worse. We agreed that he was not allowed to complain anymore and instead was going to find the beauty in the day. We left our packs at the bottom of the incline leading to the monument walked up free of the weight and spent several minutes sitting inside the monument on the steps with our backs pressed upon the cool stone so we could cool our body temperature. It was helpful. Neither of us wanted to go, but the time eventually came and thus we pressed on. We came across a hiking group of senior citizens doing 10+ miles that day and learned the group are the trail maintainers for this section of trail. Nice people but I was still so darn cranky I didn't want to talk with anyone and I resented their questions.  My foot was in pain so I switched to my sandals and socks as Shake N Bake, a nobo Thru hiker stopped to say hello on the way by. He was envious of my sandals, but they really weren't  comfortable either. By the time we crossed the footbridge over I-70 I plopped down in the shade under the overpassing bridge and put my boots back on. We we're immediately joined by the Dinamic Duo from NY who were also exhausted and seeking shade and a snack. Our plan was to do a 7 mile day and spend the night at Pine Knob. The Duo was going further. When we arrived at Pine Knob we were alone and unimpressed. I used the privy while Brian sought the shade of the shelter and lay down to rest. After joining him for a few minutes I needed to get to the spring to soak my feet and refill our water. The shelter, tent sites, spring and privy we're not that impressive to me. The location was close to the road and you could hear I-70 very clearly. We rested here for and hour and a half or so soaking our feet in a gallon Ziploc bag because there was no way to do it at the spring. We dosed with 2 Advil each and hydrated. We were joined by one day hiker who stayed only long enough for a snack. After he left some section hikers arrived and Brian struck up conversation with them having the Navy in common. By now we were feeling much better and decided we'd press on to the Annapolis Rock and leave this shelter to them.The rest, water and Advil did us both well. Brian took off like a rocket and it was tough keeping up with him! Who knew a couple of Advil would fuel him like that? I'll have to keep that in mind! We hiked the 2.2 miles to Annapolis Rocks in no time, arriving at camp after 7. Shake N Bake was there with another hiker and told us there was an awesome site by the spring. We hiked down to check it out and claimed it for the night. Right next to the spring and near a privy and bear pole. Out here  I'd much rather be close to a spring than a privy which is the far opposite at home.Camp chores were certainly a chore but we managed together and soaked our feet and had a birdbath as well with the cool spring water. We retired for the night and watched the sun set as our eyes slid shut. We slept without a rainfly since it was so hot and there was no chance of rain.","Rocky Run Shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589127,"Just after we closed our eyes last night I felt something crawling on me. I sat up to look and discovered a sizeable spider. Ewe! In the process of trying to remove him from the tent we lost sight of him and I immediately thought about it being a sleepless night! We did eventually relocate him to the exterior of the tent where he belonged, along with the tick Brian spotted on the inside of the mesh screen. Double ewe! Finally sleep would now come. I woke to the sounds of song birds and the flowing spring. A new day had begun and I stayed under my quilt soaking in every ounce of it's beauty as long as I could. I needed that and I deserved it. Eventually I exited the tent and began to get ready for the day brushing my teeth and packing up what I could. Brian enjoyed a few more minutes under the quilt and we reminisced about the previous evening until he too got up to visit the privy and fetch our bags from the bear pole so we could have breakfast. He was gone a while. I was just wondering what was taking so long when he strolled back into sight. There was a hillarious  story about Brian in the privy with a broom a spider  and a wasp  I'll let you imagine that one! He won by the way.Today would be Brian's last day on trail with me and already in the 70's at 7am it was promising to be another tough one. We had roughly 6 1/2 miles to go from the shelter to our SUV. On Sunday afternoon we packed up everything we weren't going to carry with us and loaded it into the SUV. Brian drove it to a small gravel parking  area at an AT trailhead off route 77 and our innkeeper gave him a ride back. The support for thru hikers is amazing! We broke down camp after breakfast, filtered water for the day at 1.5 liters in each bladder and an additional 1.5 liters in smart water bottles. Like soldiers on a mission we marched out of camp at 8:30 stoping only at the privy and  to rest as needed, climbing over brutal rock piles that never seemed to end. Brian registered his 3 allowed  complaints for the day and we pressed on  There aren't many photo opportunities along this stretch but we could see thru the trees there was a gorgeous view on both sides of this section of trail. Our feet were hurting and we both had blisters but we wanted to get to the parking lot before the hottest part of the day. We drank all the water in the bladders and the extra liter bottle and were halfway through the extra 1/2 liter bottle when we approached the final descent to the road. More rock scrambling. Finally. I saw the road and nearly cried with relief until I realized I saw no parking lot, no SUV. The AT miles are white blaze miles. Most shelters, tent sites, water sources, parking areas are blue blaze trails and their mileage doesn't count toward the AT miles and aren't included in my daily log. So when my Guthooks app tells me I'm at the parking lot I still have to follow the blue blaze trail to the car. On most days .02 feels like that but today it felt like 2.0. I was so exhausted when we finally arrived Brian grabbed my pack off me and I dropped in front of the SUV to pee, my face was so red and I was over heated. Brian thought quickly and had a bottle of Poland spring water in the truck, which had been sitting there for days in 90+ heat. He immediately grabbed it and poured it over my neck while I was still squatting. It might have been warm water but it was cool to me and it helped greatly. My now wet shirt was cool I was able to sit in the SUV with the fan on and begin to cool down. We sat there for a few minutes resting and cooling. We made our way to town and got a hotel room in Hagerstown after lunch at Dixie's in Smithville where my body was still working on regulating it's temperature. Later after some rest we would trade in my Keene mids for some trail runners!","Annapolis Rock tent sites

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589149,"Let me start by reminding everyone I'm married to the best husband there is. 
I had a good night of sleep after a shower, trip to Walgreens, Dick's for new trail runners and Texas Roadhouse for steak and a beer. I'm amazed at how quickly I felt refreshed and ready to go. We got some chores done (laundry) had breakfast and packed up a day pack for me with water, snacks, 1st aid kit, headlamp, etc. Always important to be prepared! Brian wanted to slack pack me today. I could hike with only a few pounds on my back instead of my whole house and this meant I could finish Maryland! 
Brian brought me to the trailhead at MD 77 where we picked up the SUV yesterday. He wanted to follow me today and had extra ice water, snacks, socks and other supplies on hand. We made a plan to connect at 3 road crossings so he could see I was well and support me with anything I needed. I could choose to stop at any of these points or finish Maryland by crossing the Mason Dixon line after Pen Mar Park. I was stoked!!!
I walked the blue blaze trail from the lot to the trail and within a few minutes I was passing Ensign Cowell shelter and it was so nice looking and visible from the trail that I walked down to take a picture and use the privy. Not the cleanest privy which I'm finding is often the case when located close to the road and easily accessible to all. Not far after I returned to the trail I came across Thumper and another hiker having lunch. Thumper had been hiking with her Dad but he returned home yesterday and she's continuing her thru hike solo, much the same way Brian and I worked it. 
The path thru the forest was so nice and I was light and feeling full of life. Then the forest abruptly ended and the trail dumped me out into a beautiful rolling field with picturesque homes across the street. The narrow dirt footpath was now flanked by tall green grass on either side with one brown post painted with a 2""x6"" white blaze. I couldn't help but stop on my way thru and take a couple of pictures. But I also filled with emotional appreciation for this suprise, my journey and life in general. With tears on my cheeks I turned my face up and spoke aloud to God with genuine thanks for all of this blessing. And I thanked him for my beautiful and loving husband who gave me more opportunity to enjoy the day. The trail rambled thru the field and back into the woods, very pleasant and gently rolling. 
When I made it to the first road crossing where MD 77 meets the trail again and Brian was there on the side of the road as promised he looked full of joy. He opened the back door of the SUV and said ""look""! I noted a strange but yet familiar backpack and asked if he was being an angel today and slack packing another hiker...and then I realized the pack belonged to Traveling Ambassador! He ran into her at that crossing and she was a few minutes in front of me. Not needing anything from the SUV I grabbed a kiss and skipped off across the road and back into the woods. Eventually I came across Traveling Ambassador soaking her feet in a stream. We chatted a minute and I was delighted for her to get the trail magic from Brian and enjoy a few miles of slack packing. She was genuinely happy to have the pleasure. 
There were a few day hikers on this section of trail, probably because it is so pleasant and also easily accessible. I passed down under some power lines and back into the forest where I came across a large stream (about 4 miles into the day) with wooden footbridge and I stopped to take off my shoes and soak my feet. While sitting there Traveling Ambassador caught up with me and sat for a soak also. We had some nice conversation about what brought each of us to the trail. I found it easy to share a bit of my ""why"" without great detail and she did the same. It was a nice moment and I hope that she and I see each other often during our journey. We both acknowledge we'll be completing the trail as different people than we started and we both welcome the changes to come. 
At Warner Bridge Gap Rd Brian was waiting for us. We refilled on ice cold water, I had a snack and Brian charged up Traveling Ambassador's phone a little. Thumper joined us and took a rest. She and Traveling Ambassador were hiking to Raven Rock shelter for the night 1 mile up the trail and I was going about 5 miles past that. It was a very steep 1 mile climb from Raven Rock hollow to the shelter. I came across a group of 3 men soaked in sweat about half way up and confirmed a water source just below them and the rock hop stream beyond it across the road. They'd hiked from Pen Mar and the climb took them all morning. What was I in for?
A mile or so past the blue blaze trail to the shelter I stopped to snack and care for my feet. I added electrolytes to my 1 liter smart water bottle and rested a few, taking 2 Advil to help cope with my foot pain. After resuming my hike I stopped to talk with Phaedrus and Wingnut who thru hiked in 2014. They let me know about the rocks ahead and assured me that for them the rocks in northern PA were the worst on the trail. Mentally and physically draining. When I arrived at the miles of rock field south of Pen Mar I understood. This challenging section shows no clear path and focus is spent on careful placement of each foot and locating the next while blaze. Many times the trail is illusive here and I would stand beside a white blaze not moving until I saw the next. It would be easy to get yourself lost off trail here. After what felt like forever and with my feet on fire I exited the dreaded rocks for softer trail and traveled the 1.3 miles left to the park among darkening skies and intermittent rain drops.
I emerged at Pen Mar Park to see Brian who directed me across and back into the trees on the AT that would bring me out to Pen Mar Rd where he'd meet me with the SUV. Across a set off railroad tracks I took my first fall on the AT. Until now I'd only managed to fall in the bathtub the night before. Now I'm sporting 2 large purple bruises on my behind! After composing myself I saw it a few feet in front of me. The Mason Dixon line. My official finish if the state of Maryland and start of Pennsylvania. I cried as I opened the box to sign the trail log. It was emotionally rewarding. I knew already that I will tell Brian I want to zero with him tomorrow. My heart and my feet had made that decision a few miles back. I'm looking forward to spending some town time with him before he heads back to NH. I shared his excitement when he told me he was able to offer trail magic in the way of a cold mountain dew to Bite Me who he found looking depleted at a road crossing and about the other hikers he was able to talk to, including the Dinamic Duo who weren't far in front of me. 
We checked into a hotel in Waynesboro PA. And had the best night of sleep so far after an Epsom salt soak for my feet. Brian got an Epsom salt soak, tick removal and poison ivy ( or poison something) treatment. He just can't leave the sidewalk without getting into something!","MD 77 Foxville Rd

A few resupply items, more Epsom salt and laundry. The hotel laundry room is a great meeting spot for thru hikers, so it seems. I met Bite Me who came in to find the washing machine full and me waiting to be next. We chatted a few. Since it would be a while he ran off to do other chores first. Then when I went to move the clothes from washer to dryer Rambling Ambassador was there. ( I previously mistakenly referred to her as Traveling Ambassador). We seem to be pretty much at the same pace and schedule. Ambassador needed to bounce some things up the trail and since the post office was closed she might have to spend another day in town. We happened to have a priority box in the SUV we could spare and Brian offered to mail it for her on Monday when he mailed my supply to me. It worked out perfectly. We ran into Bite Me out in the parking lot while we were heading out to a late lunch and Walmart. He was just returning on foot and forgot a couple of things so we gladly brought them back for him.  When we returned I saw River in the lobby. It was great to see her and know she's doing well. She started a day after me. I've never wanted to just spend the day in the room. It was quite nice actually. We tried to nap, I caught up on journaling and I repacked my bag so that I could send some things home with Brian and shave some weight. I sent home my puffy, fleece mittens and neck warmer, wool beanie and brain. The one on my pack, I still need the one in my head. Brian was able to enjoy full control of the TV remote and catch up on his favorite sports. We had dinner and communicated with Ambassador so she could ride with us to the trail head in the morning. River and Bite Me we're taking a zero and returning to the trail on Tuesday. It was early to bed for an early rise so we could leave by 9 am. A productive day with no real excitement and it was lovely.","Waynesboro

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589471,"I woke early around 5am. A bitter sweet day it will be. I get to return to the trail but I have to say goodbye to the love of my life for a few weeks. We showered, packed up and headed to the lobby for breakfast and to meet Ambassador. Bite Me and River were there to join us for breakfast and see us off. It was a very nice surprise and very sweet. We are all very supportive of each other. We arrived at the trailhead around 9:30 and Ambassador went in to finish up the small piece she missed the day before, just a few hundred feet and to sign the hiker log. I had a moment alone with Brian to say goodbye and give him a hug and kiss. Ambassador came out to the road followed by a nobo from GA ""Wobbles"" who was traveling fast and light. We all exchanged greetings and it was time to go. I crossed the road and up onto the trail and I didn't look back because I didn't want it to be harder than it was. I'll miss Brian terribly at times, I know this. But he's so loving and supportive and it makes me very comfortable out here knowing that. The initial section of trail climbed up the ridge with switchbacks, steep and steady. There were several road crossings and at each one Brian wasn't there as he had been when he slack packed me. It will be fun to do that again with him! I stopped to care for my feet as I had promised myself about once every 1-2 hours. Around 11:30 it started raining lightly. My pack was covered but I opted not to put on rain gear at that time. It was a light rain and it felt good. The rain eventually picked up in intensity and I was soaked. I stopped at Deer Lick shelters about 5 miles in. I changed out of my wet shirt and into my fleece and put on my rain kilt and jacket and my hat. I stayed a few, tending to feet and debating if I should stay. The grounds were covered in mud all around the shelter and it was uninviting to me. I hadn't seen Ambassador so I decided to continue on. Another 2.5 miles in I came to Antietam shelter. It also was close to the trail and looked uninviting, with some charred logs leaning on the fire pit and it was situated with lots of flowing water around it. I passed by without stopping and came upon Old Forge picnic area. The rain has mostly stopped now and the park was empty and beautiful. I stopped at the covered pavilion for more foot care, lunch and to use the privy. The entire place was very pleasant and I would have enjoyed it longer on a sunny day. It had that nap on a blanket under the trees feeling to it....just not in the rain. I disposed of my trash and went for water which is listed in the guide book and on Guthooks, but there was none. The sign is still on the building stating water is available year round but the pipe has been removed. As I was departing Ambassador was arriving. Another mile up the trail and right on the trail I was finally rewarded with Tumbling Run Shelter. I can't say enough positive about this shelter or it's caretaker. Simply amazing. The cleanest privy I've seen and stocked with TP and sanitizer. Covered pavilion as well as open table both with metal on the ends for use of your stove, clotheslines, fabulous tent sites and lovely spring. The shelters are named snoring and non-snoring! I didn't want to set up my tent in the rain so I chose the non snoring shelter. There was also a chance of T-storms. I'd feel better in the shelter, which at this point I had to myself. Ambassador arrived and chose a tent site. 2 hikers arrived not long after. Cool and Cats. Cool Cats. Nice guys, very friendly and hiking together. They met 4 days ago in Harper's Ferry and hit it off. It happens sometimes, and they both like having a hiking partner. The 4 of us enjoyed dinner and conversation about leave no trace practice (LNT) regarding fruit peels and other biodegradable things. We retired early but sleep didn't come easy. My sleeping pad could wake a mummy!! I turn a lot and every time I move this Thermarest NeoAir wakes me and anyone near me up. By 2am I'm guessing Cats wishes he'd slept in the snoring shelter with Cool. Cool admittedly snores by I can't imagine it's as loud as my sleeping pad. I contemplated trying to sneak out of camp early by headlamp and putting distance between us so I wouldn't have to face him in the daylight but I decided to suck up the embarrassment. Despite the rain, my noisy sleeping arrangements and having to part with my wonderful husband it was still a great trail day. The miles were good to me!","Pen Mar Rd Rouzerville PA
",Tumbling Run Shelter,"May 06, Sun",8.20
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589571,"I woke to the sounds of joyful birds including the long song of a whippoorwill. My shelter mate confirmed his sleepless night as a result of my noisy sleeping pad but wasn't overly sensitive about it. In his words he could choose snoring or sleeping pads in the shelter each night it's going to be one of them. I felt badly so I decided not to tell him about his sleep talking. At least it was incoherent, so I don't know anything I shouldn't!I cooked an oatmeal breakfast at the covered table, chocolate coconut and enjoyed a cup of coffee with it. Once Cool Cats cleared their laundry from the line and packed up I tossed my t-shirt over the line to dry. There wasn't enough sun there yet so I eventually gave up and hiked out late in a wet shirt, tired of waiting.  Oh well, my body heat would dry it. A left out of camp northbound on the trail offered a nice steep morning climb of a mile up to Chimney Rocks. Fresh legs were a bonus. I met a few day hikers enjoying the view and spent a few minutes there in awe. My baby toes were really painful so I took a seat on a rock and began the process of trying to get more comfortable. Different socks, locklacing my shoes, nothing helped and I took 2 Advil to see if that would lessen it. As I was headed back out  to the trail Ambassador arrived to take in the view.  I moseyed along with a hobble very frustrated with my feet. Ambassador soon caught up to me and knew I was in pain because she never passes me. I hike slightly faster than she does. As I told her I was about to fish around in my pack for a hack saw and rid myself of the 2 little beasts on the side of the trail she laughed and begged me not to, Instead offering me a pair of Crocks, some powder and tape. Crocks scare me, no joke. Those things look like slippery sweaty feet asking for a broken ankle, so I passed on them and took her up on the tape and powder. I re-bandaged and felt like a new woman. Thank you Ambassador!The forest floor then rolled out in front of me like a red carpet, thick and spongy and absolutely luxurious. I bounced down the trail and the miles rolled on by. There was a small climb just before the shelter and then a .3 mike blue blaze trail leading to Rocky Mountain shelter, sharply down hill. From there it was another tenth of a mile to the tent sites and at least a half mile to water on the side of Route 30. The bear box and privy were way up hill by the shelter and I resigned myself to the fact I wouldn't be using those tonight! I grabbed the site next to a picnic table. Ambassador camped up by the privy and stopped in at my site on the way to water so we enjoyed the trek together and conversation. I didn't want to make that trip more than once so I filled up 3 liters and a gallon bag. I needed to do laundry. My shirt smelled which meant I must smell too.  I also needed to carry water out in the morning based on the location of the next water source. 
Back at my site I did my laundry and had a date with a Ziploc bag and Dr Bronner in my tent. The soap that is. It's nice to have the privacy of my tent for such festivities.  There's no reason to be dirty and terribly stinky on the trail if you're willing to spend the time and energy. I have a bandana I use in the shower and in camp for bird baths I use little compressed wash clothes and wipes that are the size of nickels. Just drop them in water and they expand and unfold, add a few drops of Dr Bronner to it. In the morning I boil a little more water than I need so I can drop a wash cloth in the pot after my breakfast as wash with warm water. Cool water is only refreshing after a hike, not at 7 am! I made my dinner of chicken vindaloo which was surprisingly delicious as the sites around me filled up. Four 50-60 year old men out for a section hike and 2 young men thru hiking. It sounded like the shelter up above was filling up too. I was very hungry so I devoured some oatmeal for dessert with a package of raspberry jam squeezed on top. I know it sounds strange but I was hungry and it was darn good! I hung my bear bag retired early to my tent so I could text my hubby as well as updated my journal. I drifted nicely off to sleep by 9. Sleep doesn't come as easy as the 2""x6"" white blazes do. I was awakened at 1am by the sounds of violent wretching echoed thru the forest. This would happen twice more within the hour. Poor guy! I did fall back asleep until 3:30 when my bladder became my alarm clock. Darn! I went back to sleep again after dealing with that. I can't wait to have chicken vindaloo again! It must be time to go make my dinner!","Tumbling Run Shelter
",Rocky Mountain shelter,"May 07, Mon",6.60
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589693,"I love being awakened by the birds and that happened around 6. I lay there for a few in the warmth of my quilt just being still. Then I practiced my morning yoga with Rebecca from Prana Strong Yoga. Yes, I brought her with me...in recorded version. This morning was the first morning I have been able to do my tent yoga. There was no room in the tent when Brian was with me.  I'd practiced in bed back in Harper's Ferry and have been looking forward to this time. I love the comforting sound of Rebecca's voice. She was so kind to make these recordings for me. She and her cat that is, who wanted in on the action. I can hear him in the background and it feels like home. This morning I had to use my earbuds because the 2 young guys were up and laughing and loudly throwing around their f- bombs at 6:30. Perhaps they didn't notice my orange tent?I fetched my bear bag after yoga and hastily made my oatmeal. I skipped the coffee because I wanted to get packed up and out. At 7:50 I headed up the hill back to the trail. The beginning of the section was of large green rocks, reminiscent of the section near Pen Mar Park. It's easy to lose your way in these parts. I stowed my trekking poles and used my hands to scramble over and keep my balance. It's different with the pack weight your balance is not the same. After this though the trail opened up and it was easy cruising to Caledonia State Park. I stopped to just enjoy the sounds, smells and visuals of the forest and how they felt to me. It was a beautiful few moments. I hustled along to the park where I'd heard I could buy a shower. I'm a sucker for a shower obviously because I paid $4 and had to walk a mile and a half away to get to it. Part way there I thought of how ridiculous that was and almost turned around for a refund...but I continued on, showered, charged my phone and emptied my trash bag. I saw only 1 other hiker this morning. I was at the park, showered, back down to the trail and having lunch at 12:30. After lunch I made my way up the climb to the top of the ridge. A pretty section of trail before me developed into a beautiful tunnel of rhododendron trees. Almost fairy garden like. At the end of the tunnel I came upon a gate and the Quarry Run Shelter to find Ambassador already set up on one of 2 tent platforms. I grabbed the other and took a look around this beautifully maintained site with hanging flower baskets on the 2 impeccably maintained shelters. Nearby the shelters is a covered picnic table, fire pit and sitting swing all located across from a little babbling brook. An adorable space and most enjoyable.
 I filtered water and set up camp. A few day hikers arrived and we talked about hiking the AT and their dreams and goals. Great conversation. As evening set in a handful of young loud hikers arrived and settled into the shelters hanging all the gear and spraying permetherin.  Bite Me arrived and we welcomed the familiar face and conversation. He hiked over 12 miles today to catch up with us. 
I had my dinner of chicken and mashed potatoes and wished I'd had more. So I washed it down with a cup of coffee and started preparing for bed around 7pm. 2 more hikers arrived, friends of the group in the shelter and they decided to uncover the fire pit and have a get together while roasting hot dogs. They're very loud. It's 7:40 now, my bear bag is in the bear box  and Ambassador and I are both in our tents for the night with ear plugs in. I wonder how the night will be for Bite Me who opted for the shelter tonight.","Rocky Mountain shelter
",Quarry Gap shelter,"May 08, Tue",5.60
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590014,"Last night grew quiet surprisingly quickly and I had the best sleep yet on the trail. I woke after 1 to pee but ignored it and went back to sleep. When I awoke again I could no longer ignore so I went about it and decided after that I was wide awake. I grabbed my watch from the pocket my by head and hit the little indigo button. 5:09am. I may as well start packing up inside my tent. Quietly and slowly I did my yoga. I deflated my pad and pillow, changed from my sleeping clothes into my hiking clothes, stuffed my quilt into it's bag and wondered why it didn't seem to me lightning up outside. I checked my watch again....4:29. Damn. I waited a few, contemplating and then decided nothing has changed, I can't go back to sleep so I may as well hike out. I exited my tent and quietly took it down and stuffed it away, wet with dew. Great! Extra weight to carry today. I visited the privy and under red headlamp headed north out of the shelter switching to white light once beyond. I looked again at my watch... ironically 5:09am. I hiked thru mud and across a 2 log water crossing in the darkness before the beam of my headlamp came  upon a eye on the trail. Just one eye, and I thought snake? As I approached I saw it was a bird sleeping right in the middle of the trail. Confused, it looked at me, paused for a moment and then decided to clear the way for me by taking a short flight into a nearby bush. I don't know what kind of bird it was. It was a nice moment though, the way we looked at each other with curiosity and respect. The trail was really gentle this morning the temps were cool and I hiked with my fleece on for about 30 minutes until I shimmied out of it and left it between my pack and me, I'll stow it away when I stop. At 3.3 miles in at just after 6am I stopped at an unofficial campsite at mile marker 1089.5 and cooked up my oatmeal, relaxing for a few and enjoying the morning sounds. Terrain wise today was an easy day. Lots of soft forest mat underfoot. Another 2 miles past my breakfast spot I came upon Milesburn Cabin. The sweetest little cabin and privy complete with a sitting bench and wooden footbridge at the stream. Owned by the Patomic Appalachian Trail club the cabin is available for rent. It was closed up and not occupied so I spent nearly 45 minutes enjoying the scene, soaking my feet and coating my poor pinkies with liquid skin. I finally had to mosey on, so I crossed the stream and the nearby road and entered into a beautiful pine forest complete with soft pine matting for my feet. What a glorious day today is and the pine forest reminded me warmly about how much I love hiking in NH. 7.4 miles from where I left this morning I arrived at Birch Run Shelter. A woman was sitting at the picnic table just outside the shelter itself and I joined her. I took off my shoes and enjoyed conversation and a snack. She introduced herself as Liberty. She's been on trail for 3 weeks and is trying to decide if she'll continue or get off trail and do something else with the time off. I hope she comes to a decision that she is happy with. I could tell she was conflicted and I hope I never have to experience that dilemma. I plan to complete my hike, regardless of speed. I don't see my hike ending short of completion unless for family emergency or injury. While resting at the shelter Lifesaver and Wally who were at Quarry Gap last night stopped in for a rest and snack. Great conversation with these 2 who started in GA in February. Brrrr!I decided not to spend the night here as I had originally planned. It wasn't even lunch time yet. I could move on to Tom's Run Shelter or any of the 4 or so unofficial camp sites noted in the guide that are between here and there. And terrain was still awesome when I looked at the elevation. My feet were still doing okay. We'd see how this liquid skin would work out. About 2 miles out of Birch run I came to a stream. I soaked my feet and filled up 3 liters of fresh water not knowing how far I'd go and if I'd camp aside the trail as opposed to Tom's shelter which has a stream and privy. I came to a road crossing after that and an erie 2 mile stretch of forest that had undergone a controlled burn last September. Looked haunted. A couple of women were setting up what appeared to be a sun tarp so I stopped to ask what they were doing. When I first saw the tarp, I'll be honest I was in the mood for a little trail magic. I wouldn't have turned down a burger or a root beer! Turns out they were studying the effects of the change in habitat on nighttime insects. Doesn't sound really exciting to me but I'm sure it is to them. My feet now we're starting to really hurt and I was  really leaning toward an unofficial camp spot for the night so I continued on stopping to check out one not far out of this enchanted forest. I gave it a minute, but it felt creepy and I couldn't convince myself to stay there. Off I went. By the time I was 1 mile from Tom's run shelter I found a nice open site with room for several tents and I thought I could stay there by but I was still uncertain. My son Kyle called and we chatted a few minutes about work and I expressed my dilemma. Then I checked in with Brian to let him know I might stay here. Knowing my fear of T-storms he asked me to check the weather. Sure enough, predicted storms. Ugh. I rested a bit and had some food. Feeling more energetic but still in pain I decided to go for the shelter .9 miles away. As I was putting on my pack Ambassador came down the trail. We were so happy to see each other and it gave us both what we needed for the extra work to get to the shelter. Lovely shelter and great hikers. We met Double H,  Nomad, Willow, transformer and landfill at Tom's run as well as a few others passing through. Then Bite Me arrived! It was late and we were all exhausted. We set up our tents on provided platforms of crushed stone which were awesome and joined the other hikers at the covered pavilion for dinner and chat. After hanging our bear bags, filtering water and a privy trip we all retired. Hiker midnight is real! I told Ambassador that I would need to stay in camp longer and rest my feet in the morning as well as try to avoid some of the rain. And I fell asleep listening to the brook.","

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590015,"It rained last night and I packed up my wet tent as a few hikers were passing thru the shelter.  Tom's run is right on the trail so there's no blue blaze and hikers just passed thru. I like that actually, more socialization and fewer wasted blue blaze miles.Ambassador was under the pavilion packing up her gear and I joined here there to finish packing mine. We'd hike out together in the rain for the 3.6 to Pine Grove Furnace state park and the country store which is home of the 1/2 gallon challenge (Of ice cream that is!) and AT museum.  We were passed by No Doubt on the trail this morning. It was an easy hike though rocky and wet which equals slippery. It was so slow going for me because of my right foot that Ambassador was far ahead of me most of the time, stopping occasionally so I could catch up and she could check on me. Very kind of her and indicative of the tramily ( trail family) culture that exists out here. When I arrived at the store Ambassador and Double H were there watching No Doubt eat his half gallon of ice cream in 30 minutes. We opted for a small dish instead of an upset stomach which we enjoyed much more I'm certain. We had both made reservations at the ironmasters mansion hostel right next door. I had spoken to the innkeeper on Wednesday and Ambassador had received an email confirmation the same day for a 1 night stay. Ambassador was expecting a package to arrive there as well. And I thought my food drop would be there which was perfect timing as I was on my last few items, but as it turns out it was sent to a post office 20 minutes away. Approaching the hostel steps we saw a note that said ""Closed for private function"". What? Seriously? We went up and sure enough a bunch of 3rd grade children had the hostel for the night. Innkeeper was reported to be upstairs however we couldn't get him to answer the phone and the bell that was previously located at the desk to ring in his apartment was no longer there according to a teacher with the occupying students who tried to assist us. Why on Earth would you take reservations for a day you have no available space and then not bother to call, text or email to let us know you've made a mistake so that we can make other arrangements? The next shelter was a 7.5 mile hike and there was no way I could do it. I needed a ride to an outfitter for new shoes and some rest. We enjoyed some fries, fresh water, free WiFi and phone charge at the store and contemplated our options. The campground less than a mile away was our only option. While we discussed our situation Mama Sue who was at a nearby table on the porch said that she stayed at the hostel Wed night and was booked for Thursday also, until Thursday morning when the innkeeper Jeff told her she couldn't stay because it was rented to a private group. Mama Sue (73 yrs old) slept in her car on Tues night because the hostel was closed. She's traveling in support of her son and his group of Monks who are hiking 12 weeks on the trail to spread happiness. They were sobo and I'd passed them 2 days ago! Yes, it was a sight. All of a sudden 2 robed Monks and about 6 or 8 hikers appear before me on the trail and I hadn't been eating any wild mushrooms! Well Mama Sue found a trail angel who put her up for the night and I was happy to hear that!!I walked to the AT museum and restrooms and Ambassador came in search of me. She'd met Windeagle and her wife LeAnn at the store and they we're staying at the campground. LeAnn is support for Windeagle's hike and they gave us a ride to Dick's about 40 minutes away. They also drove us to the ranger station so we could get a site and drove us right to it. Trail angels for sure! What a blessing, honestly. I was in such a funk until then. In pain and so irritated with the innkeeper. How unprofessional. We set up site before heading out to Dick's. Almost complete with our set up we scrambled for our rainfly and dove into our tents as the sky opened up with severe T-storms including hail. I was scared for sure and Ambassador was quite comforting. Surprised by my level of comfort I dashed from my tent to our trail angels car without hesitation in the midst of it all when they arrived to pick us up.  Ambassador just missed me and was over at my tent with her trekking umbrella to escort me. She is very very kind. Off we went with so much hail on the ground it looked like a fresh coat of snow. I had help from Luke at Dick's who fit me in a men's Keene trail runner with a nice roomy toe box and my pinkies were so happy we walked out wearing them. My feet and me, an awesome 3 some. I can't hike without them and they can't without me. We're in this together all the way! Nearly 8 pm when we got back we showered and made a quick dinner when River texted me. She was at Tom's Run waiting out the storm earlier and had hiked into town to catch up with us. Trying to find the campground with no phone signal and no map is a hikers nightmare. We have trail maps but in towns we rely on Google maps.etc. I asked our trail angels to rescue her and they did. 15 minutes later River was next to us setting up her tent. We were late to bed and exhausted but the stress we each encountered earlier in the day was dissipated. We were all safe and dry and happy. We had all we needed. Tomorrow will be a zero for me and Ambassador. We needed to get our packages and my feet and I agreed on a rest for healing. I think River will hike out in the morning.

The plan today was to be ready by 7:30 am so our trail angel could bring me to the post office when she dropped Wind Eagle off at the trail with her Chihuahua Romeo for some slack packing. Ambassador and I were dressed and ready with breakfast in our bellies when they pulled in to pick us up. LeAnn professionally navigated down a narrow back country gravel road to a spot where the AT crosses and she had picked Wind Eagle up at yesterday. Romeo waswhining to get his little feet out on the trail, trembling with excitement. I've never known a Chihuahua to hike but as soon as the door opened his feet hit the ground and he ran off down the trail. Back out to sheet iron roof road ( funny when the GPS says it!) we headed to Mt Holly Springs to the post office for my package from Brian with my resupply in it. The ladies there were both awesome, very friendly and helpful. I retrieved my parcel and sent my pinkie squishing trail runners back home. Next we were dropped off at the dollar store while LeAnn went to Sheetze for ice. Ambassador carries a lot of fresh food for her supply and the clerk had told LeAnn of a produce stand and farmers market down the street and we went. Ambassador bought me an apple and I picked up some asparagus to cook with my dinner. It's very exciting to have fresh fruit and vegetables. When we arrived back at the campsite we did laundry in the sink at the bathhouse with the $1 bottle of tide I scored and hung our bear lines out as clothesline. Really tacky looking but we were determined to smell and feel good for a day! The rest of the day was pretty relaxed. Ambassador went up to the ironmasters mansion hostel to get her package after 2pm, the time Jeff said the mail comes, to find that he hadn't answered the door when the mailman came in the morning and the package wasn't left because it required a signature. Upset, she asked for the notice that was left and returned to the campground to use my phone to call the post office and arrange to pick it up there tomorrow. We walked down to one area of the campground where with Verizon service you can get 1 bar. Otherwise there's no service. After 4 attempts she was finally able to confirm the package would be at the post office for her to pick up after 6:30am tomorrow. And once again our trail angels would come thru.  We had to move sites also because we were staying tonight and the campground was full. We packed it all up to move a 10th of a mile around the corner and set it all up again. Had there been any white blazes we could have called it a nero!Within minutes the campground which was nice and quiet Thursday night was filling up and kids and adults with loud voices rose well above the pleasant bird chatter and became annoying. The bathhouse which was professionally cleaned this morning was now a mess with cookies on the floor and a woman toting the liner from the back of her SUV to clean in the shower. I was READY to get back on the trail. All 4 of us wondered how we'd get to sleep. The nicity was the smell of campfires.River texted and asked if I'd take a photo of Wanda, Bill and dog Lucy for her. She'd had breakfast with these campers this morning before she left and wanted to include them in her journal. Happily they agreed and River was very happy that I'd gotten it. I'll have to send it from the store tomorrow, our drop off point, when I have access to WiFi. We went to bed at hiker midnight even though we know it will take a while to fall asleep.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590469,"At 7:30 am our trail angels arrived at our site to wisk Ambassador and I up to the store where we left off 2 days before. We took advantage of the wifi to send and receive messages and update my journal. Ambassador had gotten a 6:30am ride to the post office to pick up her parcel and she was happy! We left from the store just a little after 8 am and it was a nice walk in park, literally. Easy flat and wide along the river and pleasant hearing the birds and passing the early morning fishermen. After a nice mile or so the inevitable climb began. Slow and steady up and away. Not all that unpleasant but I was a bit overwhelmed by the weight of my pack since the supply box... with extras. I know my husband adores me, but PB and j weighs a lot!!! I lugged that sucker for over 7 miles in the heavy wet air. The forest was so beautiful this morning. Like a scene from a movie where they use fog machines. Dense and beautiful. I stopped only once to pee and take my shoes off for a rest about 6 miles in on a log. It was nice to sit there and not feel rushed. The break does me well and always provides me with a boost. While I was sitting Ambassador passed by. She'd already had a break and was continuing to the shelter. I arrived at Tag Brook just beyond the blue blaze trail to the shelter at around noon. Ambassador and River were both there. River had camped the night before at an unofficial site a couple of miles from the shelter. We all filtered water and I took the opportunity to soak my feet while doing so. It's so cold it's numbing but it feels so good on trail weary feet. I back tracked to the blue blaze trail and up to the shelter. The sun was just now burning off the moist foggy air. The shelter was nice. 4 bunks and space for 4 more on the floor. I could have hiked further and it was noon, but I promised myself slow and steady. Ambassador had arrived before me and saved me a bottom bunk across from her. We were the only 2 there for a few hours. I strung my bear line and hung my wet tent from the night before's rain. The sun dried it nicely and I stowed it away while Ambassador caught a nap. I also took the time to call a special person in my life, my  friend Pam. We had a great conversation as I sat at the picnic table in the tenting area and enjoyed the warmth of the sun and her cheerful voice. Then I called Brian and it was so wonderful to hear his voice too. I hadn't had good cell service for a few days. It warmed my heart to talk to these two people. Just what I needed. Not long after I got off the phone and returned to the shelter to set up my bunk about 12-15 girl scouts came into camp and set up in the tent area. Well, it was good while it lasted! While the girls giggled and made camp the storm clouds were closing in. Before long the shelter was occupied by Tom, a section hiker who claimed the bunk above me and Bub, Shaggy, Starman and Squirrel who were nobo from GA. Then the thunder rolled and it confirmed they would claim the last bunk and 3 floor spaces for the night instead of hike on. Jonathan, another section hiker, was in the woods failing at his attempts to hang the hammock he hadn't used in 2 years. As the rain began Jonathan claimed the last floor space. The thunderstorm ensued and soaked hikers kept coming into camp looking for safety and a dry spot. Field Trip took a corner and slept under Ambassador's bunk and before long someone was under mine as well. 10 spots in an 8 person shelter and the rest out in the tenting area. I had managed to make dinner, eat and clean up just as the rain began. It was just after 5:30 so it would be a while before I could sleep, if I could sleep. I just don't sleep well in shelters but I prefer them in the rain. It's a love hate kind of relationship. It's also male dominated out here. Not as many women on trail as men. I've become a master at changing my clothes in disguise. It's not like you can duck into a private spot to change. But it works and wearing a skirt helps that. I was in my bunk at 7pm when the 2nd round came through. I felt calm and safe. But not quite ready to sleep. I turned my face to the wall because it's darker. We'll see how much sleep comes tonight.","Pine Grove State Park

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590493,"I didn't sleep well, no surprise. It wasn't because of the storms, it actually was calm most of the night but still raining. It might be the awareness of so many strangers, the lack of privacy and noisy sleeping pads. I turn a lot at night and my sleeping pad is not rated quiet. It's known for comfort and r-value. I have to pee in the night. Why don't all these other people need to? Then I wouldn't feel badly if I wake people up. So I lay there just wanting dawn to come and it's 3am. Finally I can't stand it anymore and I have to get up and get relief. I grab my headlamp from beside me and I can't get the red light only the white so I dim it. I slide to the end of my bunk and carefully place my foot next to the head poking out from under my bunk. At 3am this is a very strategic maneuver. I slip out and over to the side and behind the shelter. What a relief!!!!I was able to doze off for a little while longer after returning to my bunk. As the song birds started just before dawn so did the ""shhhhhh"" sound....the deflating of the sleeping pads. It's a distinct sound. Hiker habit is to cue yourself to get up by opening the air valve while still laying on the pad. Once it's deflated you can't help but want to get up. The nobos from GA were the first and I followed suit. I packed up, grabbed my food bag from the bear box, brushed and skipped a hot breakfast for a Luna bar. After filtering water to fill my 1 liter bottle I stuffed it in the side pocket of my backpack knowing I already had 1.5 liters in my bladder. I left camp just before 8am. More showers and T-storms today, mostly after 2pm. I was going to do 8 miles to Alec Kennedy shelter and take a break. If I felt up to it after that I would go 4 more to Boiling Springs. I'd figure out where to stay when I get there. There's a 17 mile stretch with no shelter and no camping except at the hiker campground by the RR tracks in Boiling Springs. It's free....but with T-storms I really don't like being in a tent. I hit the highest point of the day at 11am and 6 miles out at the""Rock Maze"". Amply named. Giant Boulder scramble at the top of the ridge. As soon as I was up there I heard it. It has been raining all morning but lightly and despite the fact I was wearing my rain coat not on me but tucked in between myself and my pack I couldn't get it on me in time. The thunderstorm came without warning and I had been watching what I could see of the sky for a while now. No dark clouds that I could spot. I was up on top and the maze requires climbing which is tough on a dry day. The rocks are huge and slippery. I couldn't make it up and over one section with my pack on and couldn't crawl under with it on either. I whipped it off and threw it and my poles on top and scrambled up. I was 100% focused on getting thru the maze so I could get off this ridge before the storm was on top of me, but that wasn't going to happen. I picked up my pack to put it back on and the attached chest/belly pack that I use for my snacks, phone and other immediates fell off and landed in a puddle. Nothing damaged because I keep things in a Ziploc bag when it's raining. But now I had to take time to reconnect it and get my pack on. It's pouring and the lightning is flashing. I take a few steps forward but the storm's on top of me now and I'm scared. Scared but not frozen. There's no place to shelter so I run back towards where I just was and take as much shelter as possible under a slanted boulder, which isn't much. I threw my poles to the side and pull my rain jacket which I managed to wiggle into when I put my pack back on but not zip up over my head. I crouched down to make myself small and my left foot slid down the muddy slope so I'm loosing footing. I eventually have to stand up and reposition in between bolts of lightning. I'm asking God out loud to please help me and keep me safe. When the thunder fades enough and the downpour lessens I stand up. I take a few steps north and I stop as I see Field Trip crawl out from a void under some boulders. We looked at each other, stunned that we were each not alone and blinked a few times. I broke the silence with ""Shit! That totally sucked!"" And I asked him if he was well sheltered, he looked pretty dry except his hair and he said he was as soon as he heard the first thunder but there was only enough room for 1. We made our way thru the rest of the maze which is easy to get lost in and based on his experience in front of me he aided in some helpful navigation for me. Then he pulled ahead of me down the trail. I took my time, soaked and shaken down the steep decent of slippery rocks, mud and leaves. I arrived at Alec Kennedy shelter to find Field Trip there in his dry fleece having lunch. I joined him. Before I sat I went behind him in the shelter and stealthy took off my wet top and put my dry fleece on and removed my wet skirt, leaving my wet leggings and sat down beside him at the edge of the shelter draping my legs with my rain coat for warmth. It's 55° today and hypothermia is a very present concern. It can happen quickly in this situation if I let my body cool off and I don't get dry. I ate a hasty PB and j on my last tortilla and some rice crisps. I need to fuel to stay warm also. I can't stay here tonight, I need to get to Boiling Springs and get dry and warm. Field Trip is counting his food and making his moves based on his supply. I offer him 2 PB packets and 6 jelly and he's grateful. I thanked him for the navigation assistance in the maze. I had  quick conversation with Brian about work and that I was hiking into Boiling Springs but I don't share why.  As I'm getting up to head to the privy Tom ( now T-Bird) arrives. I met him last night as he stayed in the bunk above me. When I return from the privy I must put my wet clothes back on, so I step to the rear of the shelter and change, keeping my fleece dry. I put my rain jacket on over my wet shirt. It will hold in my body heat. I say my goodbye and take leave. I've got 4 miles to town. The rain never stopped but it did lessen to drizzle. I stayed moving quickly but as carefully as possible down the rest of the decent and the last 2 miles of relatively flat trail. I called Brian and asked him to help me with a room in Boiling Springs  I just needed to keep moving and the 2 places  in the book didn't answer the phone . He texted me a couple of options with numbers  As I walked thru the park and crossed  into town a silver pickup truck crossed the road and pulled up behind me. The driver rolled down the window and asked if I knew where I was going. I told him to the ATC office just ahead and then I'd figure it out. He gave me some information about Lisa who runs a hostel and a few places close where I can be warm and eat. Lisa's name and number are on the wall on the porch of the ATC. I can hardly mutter thank you. His genuine care for me, a total stranger choked me up. I feel so blessed by the genuine respect and love of hikers in this small town. I turned and walked towards the ATC, past the fishermen on the riverside with my head looking down, hoping the emotion streaming down my cheeks would be mistaken for the rain. I couldn't hold it back and it felt good to release it but I just couldn't speak.  I reached the porch at the ATC and met 3 hikers there trying to figure out their plans. I sat at the picnic table and called the BNB Brian gave me. No answer. I tried to book online but it wouldn't allow me to choose today as check in. I checked Guthooks app and saw that in Carlisle there's a days inn and called. The clerk told me just come over, he's got a room for me at a hiker rate of $60. Next call, Mike's shuttle. He said $20 and he'll come get me in 15. He's right on time, super nice. My check in was slow but once in my room I was delighted. I turned the heat up to 78° (Brian would shoot me if he were in the room!) And I take a long hot shower and put on dry clothes. I'm glad I have an extra hiking skirt and top in my pack so I don't have to put my pajamas on to go for dinner. There's a 24 hour diner next door. The Middlesex diner. I'm feeling so much better now. I walk over and Cristy is my waitress. She brings me exactly what I needed. 2 root beer, a steak dinner with baked potato, broccoli and salad. Yum. I'm warm dry and full, I get my laundry done and I slip into my king size bed, rub my feet and it's lights out after I plan a 12 mile slack pack for tomorrow with an 8:15 am pickup from Mike, a shuttle I'll share with River. She and Thumper are here at the hotel too! Hopefully I can miss any rain!","James Fry (Tag Run) Shelter
",Boiling Springs ATC,"May 13, Sun",12
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590695,"Michael the shuttle driver arrived a few minutes early to get River and I to our needed slack pack locations. As I was getting ready to go I noticed my hotel room door wasn't locking. Vinay, the manager called maintenance and they we're there in less than a minute. It's not that I had any money in my room but all I need out here is in there! I only have my wallet, sunglasses, some snacks, rain jacket, 1 liter of water and some aqua tabs with me today. And my trekking poles of course!Michael dropped me off at the ATC in Boiling Springs just before 8:45. The center was open so I went in for a minute to say hello. I left my AT passport back in my room and I was bummed because I wanted to have it stamped. The woman was really sweet and stamped a piece of paper I can attach to my passport instead. Sweet! There's been an issue in town with trail magic in the form of coolers unattended on the side of the road and at trail heads. It's created an issue with animals and also some hikers who hang around town for free food, gear and accommodations. The ATC is running a campaign titled "" don't feed the wildlife"" and it's a photo of hikers inside a cage. Kind of humorous. I set off for my 12 miles from the porch there. It was foggy but nice. After a short road walk I entered the woods for a bit. I couldn't resist sending a video to Brian. The birds were so loud and beautiful it was just music to my ears. I was cruising along because the terrain was very flat. The trail had usual rocks and roots but today was an easy day despite the 12 miles. From the woods the trail suddenly opened up to a farm. Beautiful pasture area and the trail skirts along the woodline. The ATC purchased land here years ago to eliminate a 14 mile road walk. They lease the property out to local farmers. It's really beautiful. I passed thru several farms with steps that took me up and over the fence and into the field. It was a great mix of farm pasture, woodland and riverside walking. An uneventful day. Eventually the fog burned off and the sun claimed victory. I stopped at a spot just outside the cow pasture where a path had been mowed out about 200' to a picnic table beside a small private pond. It looked like someone's special spot as there was a small vintage camper there which looked as though it hadn't been used for a while. It was just a really sweet spot. I sat on the picnic table and took off my shoes to rest my feet a bit. It was wonderful to not have my heavy pack and also not be rushed. Michael was picking up a group at Sherwood Dr at 4pm and I'd catch a ride back to the hotel that way. So I dawdled and 100% enjoyed my pace. I stopped in at the Scott Farm which is owned by the ATC and used as a work center. They provide potable water, privy and picnic area. I signed the trail register and noted the sign on the water hydrant stating the water tested positive for bacteria and would need to be treated. Not seeing the privy I moved on. I was almost done now and I could wait. I loved the boardwalk areas along the river. I met a woman with a beautiful black lab and ran into Thumper who was slack packing sobo on the section. We stopped and chatted a few and went on to finish up our miles. I came across a funny sign ""Trip Hazzard ahead"" which made me laugh. The whole trail is a trip hazzard. Seriously! I also came across a cemetery from the 1700's and 1800's belonging to the Chambers family. I spent a few minutes there reading the stones. We live so much longer today and I'm grateful for the opportunities that presents.I finished up at 2:30 and didn't want to wait for Michael so I called an Uber. While I was waiting at the small parking area on Sherwood Dr a couple called me over to their SUV. I met Giddy Up and Fearless and they gave me some nuts and a soda.  Giddy Up is hiking and his wife Fearless is slack packing him. She just completed her thru hike and he's starting his. They support each other and they'll attend trail days in Damascus before she heads home and he continues north. Very nice people. My Uber arrived and drove past. He's never picked up a hiker before and it was foreign to him because I'm litterally on the side of the road. He figured it out and came back. My first Uber and his first hiker. He dropped me back at the hotel where I rinsed the mud off my clothes in the shower and hung them up. River stopped by and was headed to do laundry so when she was done with the washer I paid for the dryer and we threw mine in too. River wanted to drink the last 3 beers she had purchased the day before. 3 local brews. So I helped! We split the 3 and chatted in my room until dinner time. By now T-Bird and Ambassador had checked in to the hotel. We invited them and Thumper to all join us for dinner at the Middlesex diner. Ambassador was tired and declined but T-Bird, River, Thumper and myself walked next door and rounded the day out with dinner together. The comradeship is really nice. I like it. We hike our own hikes but meet up and it's a perfect blend. After returning from dinner it was late, well past our bedtime. I watched TV for a little while, Highway Thru Hell? It was intense. I haven't watched TV for 2 weeks and I could feel my adrenaline. I had to turn it off. It's time to sleep. Tomorrow I check out and get underway again.","Boiling Springs ATC
",Sherwood Dr,"May 14, Mon",12
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590790,"I had a great night of sleep and was ready to get going early. I met Ambassador and T-Bird in the lobby having breakfast but I opted for breakfast at the diner so I ran over there and enjoyed 2 eggs with corned beef hash, home fries and coffee. When I returned to the hotel I packed up my bag minus a few things to send home and filled up my water. I took my priority envelope to the manager at the front desk and they brought it to the post office for me and returned with the receipt. Extremely hiker friendly here. I ordered up an Uber to bring me back to Sherwood Dr so I could pick up where I left off. Thumper is going to meet me at Cove Mt shelter for the night. A 5 mile day for her and 10 for me. Matt was my Uber driver and my wait was 30 minutes. I was getting nervous, already an hour later than I wanted to leave. Matt was also hiker friendly and knew right where the trail head was so off we went. He dropped me off at the small parking area, I threw on my pack and crossed the street for the nobo trail. My goal originally was to stop at Darlington shelter for a break 3 miles in and then proceed on to Cove Mt shelter for a 10 mile day. Because I started late I passed by the Darlington shelter and it's Taj Mahal privy. I guess I'll never be able to confirm that it is. Severe T-storms were expected later this afternoon and evening. I wanted to be at the shelter by 2pm. I don't want a repeat of being unprotected on a ridge in a thunderstorm. But some lessons get repeated. The biting black flies were out today in full force and it was 82 and humid. I was sweating like crazy and really pushing through the miles to make my goal. The bugs chewed the back of my arms up and irritated me all morning. It really soured my mood. The trail is funny though, because it can suddenly change and it did. I found myself standing at the edge of a beautiful field with a nice breeze. I stood there for 5 minutes watching the tall grass waive with the wind. It was an amazing experience to just be in that moment enjoying that. From complete irritation to amazement. Totally changed my mood for a while. I continued on and crossed the road but the bugs were still relentless as I entered another field. I sat in the grass at the edge of the trail and had a snack and some water, thinking about getting out my head net. A few nobo hikers passed me and a section hiker sobo stopped to say hello. When I resumed hiking the trail followed the tree line at the edge of the field and I regretted not taking out my net. I was almost across the next open field when a man yelled ""Trail magic"" from my left. I noticed the small handwritten sign in front of me and followed a warn path in the grass to a small parking lot with a red pickup truck and man in his 60's. There was a cooler on the open tailgate and a bag next to it with candy bars. I grabbed a Dr Pepper and 2 fun size almond snickers, crossed the lot and sat on a log in the shade at the opposite side of the lot. There were now 3 hikers sitting in the shade next to the truck conversing with the gentleman. I wanted to but I couldn't which is why I crossed to the other side of the lot. I get so emotional about things like this. I can't explain it. I could barely choke out thank you while holding back the tears. I don't know if it's the fact that to a total stranger I am a significant person. My wellfare and happiness matter to him. It's just overwhelming to me. As I disposed of my trash he encouraged me to take more and take it with me. I grabbed a propel because I needed the electrolytes, thanked him and headed out of the parking lot and across the road to the trail. I dawned my bug net and entered the woods. The birds were singing a little sweeter this afternoon. I found the bug net a bit warm and removed it after 10 minutes. I'll have to get some bug spray in town. I had 2 big 1 mile climbs today and I'd already done 1. The 2nd was before me and I felt myself running out of steam despite the sugary snacks but I pushed myself. In front of that a nice open view at the power lines where I stopped briefly for a couple of photos. 2.6 miles left to go. As soon as I stepped into the woods I heard the warning grumble of the predicted T-storms. It was well after 2pm. I began to hustle. I didn't want a repeat of the scene 2 days ago up on the ridge. The grumbling got louder and I walked faster. A rock scramble.... perfect. This one was tougher and in a few sections I threw my poles down the rocks in front of me turned around and scrambled down holding boulders and trees. Once on the other side the wind began to pick up. I'm thankful that it blows away the bugs but I know what it means. The rain starts lightly and I just focus on the trail though over my left shoulder to the west I can see the dark sky. I made it to shelter just as the hail started. Thumper was there waiting for me and under the safety of shelter we watched the storm, ate dinner, cleaned up, put our bags in the bear box and crawled into bed.","Sherwood Dr

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590810,"I slept great last night, best shelter sleep so far. Had a great bunk with rails so all my stuff stayed in my bunk with me. I was warm and comfortable and felt safe. Mouse Trap was here, great guy of Lithuanian heritage. Today Thumper and I will hike 8.3 to Clark's Ferry shelter but since the trail walks thru Duncannon we'll break up the day. 
We left the shelter just before 9am after breakfast and packing up. It was raining so we covered our packs and wore rain gear. Rain gear isn't what it seems. You still get wet because either the rain eventually soaks thru or you sweat your clothes wet under the rain gear. They say the difference between the 2 is 35 minutes because either way you're wet. Almost immediately out of the gate we were looking at the famous Pennsylvania rocks. I actually liked them. They were crafted into steep steps and they were challenging but I thought fun. They're not the kind you can just walk down, it's s sideways thing one leg at a time. The decline was nearly 2 miles. There are many views here in PA, we can see them in the guide however we never see them because we're constantly in the rain clouds. I was hiking along and watching my feet because the rocks and steps require 100% focus. I looked up just in time to see the trail take a sharp right. Thumper was about 5-10 minutes ahead of me and I hoped she made the turn. About half mile ahead No Push and another hiker stopped to ask if I were Puddles and told me that Thumper missed the turn and was waiting for me back at the JCT. I wasn't going to back track so I texted Thumper to let her know I'm up ahead and already in Duncannon. I waited at the street but the mosquitoes were awful and I couldn't stand still so I walked further into town and let Thumper know I was under the awning at Sunoco. Eventually she arrived and we proceeded north thru town. Duncannon is not what I expected. It's a sleepy little depressed town with a few hiker amenities. We stopped at Goodies who has a small hiker resupply but they close at 11am and it was 11:20am. I need fuel. I'm carrying 2 partial 4oz cans because I bought an 8oz in Boiling Springs but it stopped working after one use. So River gave me these 2 partials before I left the hotel. We stopped across the street at the Doyle, a hiker hostel with a bar and food. We each enjoyed a local brew and I enjoyed a cheeseburger and fries and a cup of homemade sausage and potatoe soup. Indian ( a fobo who works there) filled our water bottles for us too. The owner , Pat is a nice guy who really likes hikers. Indian hiked into town in 2016 and never left so Pat put him in to work. Pat's out of sorts because his bride of 40 years who he married after a 34 day courtship is in the hospital recovering from a surgery. They're never apart, they work together and he seems lost. One of the hikers who was at the trail magic yesterday gave him a hand picking up supplies and errands to help him out. That was very sweet. I'll add Pat's wife to my prayers. We enjoyed the food, took a couple of pics outside and headed north. We still needed some food because we're both a little light on what we need for 3 days till another resupply. I still need fuel and I'm kicking myself for not getting an 8oz at the Doyle. I just don't want the weight. We skip across a really scary highway to get the the Pilot Travel stop and pick up the food we need and cross back over the highway. We need to use the sidewalk on the bridge that crosses the Susquehanna River. As we're crossing we see Mouse Trap headed south. He has stopped at Sonny Dayz laundry and left his phone there. He was already at the Clark's Ferry shelter and had to hike back down. Bummer!We met up with Evo who was just getting dropped off by the RR tracks to head up to the shelter. He's starting a section hike. He and Thumper headed up the 1 mile climb in front of me. It was still raining. There was a very technical rock scramble up near the top where it required ditching the trekking poles and sliding down some of them. I took my time. I arrived at the shelter at 4:30 and as soon as I walked in a girl in the bunk opposite Thumper said she'd been following me on Instagram! I recognized her as @journeytothetrail and her trail name is Steady. Sweet lady! I'm very much enjoying my time with her and Thumper just as I do with River, Ambassador and T-Bird. All wonderful people. There were no bunks left so I pulled up a spot on the floor and changed into dry clothes. Evo used my bear line to string up a clothes line for us to hang up our sopping wet stuff.  Moxie and Mouse Trap arrived soon after we has eaten our dinners. Mouse Trap got his phone!!! I sleep with my head facing out towards the opening of the shelter because of the mice. Many of these shelters have mice. The mice walk along the outside walls mostly so I don't want my head there. We bush and store our food bags in the bear box and turn in. I catch up on my journal and it's lights out.","Cove Mt shelter
",Clark's Ferry shelter,"May 16, Wed",8.30
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591190,"Well there is that reason I slept with my head facing out towards the shelter opening. I couldn't sleep well, actually woke up at 11 pm and rolled onto my stomach and propped my chin up on my folded arms and looked out at the night. It was peaceful and I'm so tired I want to sleep but sleep escapes me. Then I see it. Lurking in the shadows until it makes a bold scurry across the floor boards in front of me....the (not so Mickey) mouse. Damn! I'm pretty sure it went out but not positive because now my mind will inevitably play tricks on me for a few minutes. And then I remind myself it's a mouse, a tiny mouse. I make a conscious decision to roll back over, close my eyes and focus on my breathing until I drift off. I wake at 5 but it's too early to get up so I lay there needing to pee. I don't want to wake everyone up. Eventually Mouse Trap stirs. He quietly gets up followed by Evo and Moxie. We 3 girls stay put until Evo and Moxie are dressed and gone. Then we surrender and deflate our sleeping pads. It's still raining and we've got a short day of 6.7 to Peter's Mountain shelter. None of us are excited about another rainy day of hiking but the miles await. I'm still super low on fuel so I eat a cold breakfast of a Luna bar and I filter water at the spring. The notes in Guthooks state that Peter's Mountain spring is 300 steep steps down from the shelter. Yeah....I'll pass on that and hope I can carry enough. I take 2.5 liters which I think should get me thru until Friday morning. We set out just after 8am Thumper and I. Steady is still getting ready. It was a strong hike and I felt good for most of it. Thumper is ahead of me but we don't try to hike together, we just want to hike our own and meet at shelters or camping sites. It's ironic about this section of trail having the views and we can't see them. It's like someone taking away your dessert! I pass the Table Rock view and I can't help myself, I take a picture of the sign and of the view, a white rain cloud. I reached the shelter around noon and Thumper is there. A nice shelter which is the largest yet sleeping 20. It has a loft upstairs and we choose the first floor so be don't have to lug our packs up the wooden ladder to the loft. I roll out my mat on the right side, next to a long wooden box with padlock that holds tools and supplies for the caretaker. I can use this box as a table to set all my stuff on, so maybe it will dry a bit. Thumper hung up a line and we draped wet clothes over it. The shelter has a rolled up shade to block the wind and rain if needed and a picnic table inside under cover which is awesome! We leave the shade rolled up. The rain stops around 2pm and Steady is now there. I visited the privy and gave a full report to the ladies. Use the woods for #1 and #2. Unfortunately this privy is overused and the turd tower is just below the seat. A vision I won't soon forget. The privy is right off the trail and located near intersecting local trail so it's convenient for many people not just AT hikers. The nobo bubble isn't even here yet so I have no idea how things will look when that happens. The next shelter is 18 miles away at Rausch Gap. All is quiet when suddenly hikers are pouring in, about 15-20 of them. They litterally storm the shelter and they're loud. They're behavior is as if no one else is there. They have a discussion about their plan and check out the disappointing privy. Some decide to push on and some stay. Unfortunately. In all my other tenting or shelter experiences on this journey it's been nice socializing with other hikers. People from all different walksbof life and all ages. This group differs. The "" leader"" it seems is a hiker named Joe Kool ( with a K) and then there are his tramily. Joe Kool doesn't have any respect for hikers in the shelter that aren't in his tramily and he has no inside voice. We've all met this type of person, can't tone down is always turned ""on"" and can only talk about themselves. He smokes cigarettes and pot in the shelter. I'm laying on the floor by the picnic table. There are many in this group and about 6 are in the shelter the rest in tents or hammocks but the gathering spot is the picnic table. Other hikers are eating their dinner outside on the steps. I finally ask if I can get a seat at the table to make and eat my dinner and they do make room. I take care of business making a little small talk with Lotus and escape back to my space. More pot and cigarettes are smoked and at 8:30 another thru hiker arrives and takes a spot on the floor up by my head. We all stink but he smells terrible!!! Like dirty stinky feet and I glance up to see they're sticking out of his quilt. He's very quiet and nice and he spending the night next to Joe Kool who is sleeping under the picnic table so he can be near the opening of the shelter because he smokes....all night. T-Bird arrives, makes dinner on the steps and crawls into a space between Thumper and Steady.  River arrives and says hello and I can tell she's quickly summed up the scene. Though there's room on the floor next to me she sets up her tent. Eventually the gang settles down and goes to bed. But Joe Kool stays up with his phone... smoking. And as the breeze gently blows the smoke towards Steady and I we look at each other because we know it's going to be a long night. Every time I hear the lighter I cringe. He's a chain smoker, great. I do drift off to sleep but the entire shelter is awoken at 11pm sharp. Not by Mr Kool. By Mr Porcupine who is under the shelter chewing on it. It echoes loudly and goes on for at least 15 minutes before Mr stinky gets up and goes outside to convince it to leave. Rest comes again. Hopefully I will get more than anticipated!","Clark's Ferry shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591388,"Mr stinky feet got up at 4pm, was extremely quiet and respectful and hiked out. At 5am Joe Kool's alarm went off. And then again a few minutes later. His gang was up, the ones in the shelter and in tents and it was full conversation about the ""dirty thirty"" ( how many miles they were planning to hike today) and scurvy ( spoken with a pirate voice). Now I'm having my first 2nd hand cigarette of the day followed  by weed  lovely. I wondered for a few minutes if I were actually back in middle school and if they'd break out in a fart game or just finally be ready and get out of camp. I want them to be successful in their 30 mile endeavor so I don't have to spend another night with them. I learned later that they'd gotten drunk in Duncannon the night before and been a spectacle. Finally they're all gone a little after 6. I layed there until 6:30 and decided to get up. I'm fully awake as is everyone else.  I have a cold breakfast and T-Bird hikes out with me at 7:45. He likes to hike with us because he's only hiking PA and then he goes back to work. He feels motivated and has a better pace than when he's alone. He's a good hiker and he keeps a 2 MPH pace just as most of us do. He's quicker on the downhills than I am and uphill is tougher for him because he's only been out here for 1 week. He's easy going and not chatty. Thumper, Rx, Steady and River all leave after us. Steady is doing 10 miles and Thumper isn't sure if she'll stay with Steady at the campsite 10 miles out or hike on to Yellow Springs campsite for 13.4 which is where I'm headed. The spring at Peter's Mountain shelter is down 300 stone steps. Mind you, I'm no slouch...I'm hiking the AT, but I conserved my water because after watching anyone else who made that trip I wasn't going to go there! I had a half liter in my water bladder and Thumper gave me another half so I left this morning with one liter to make it to the next water source 6.4 miles away. Since it's cool out this morning I'm confident with that. T-Bird and I run into Thumper on trail near the spring. She'd passed us a while ago. She hikes faster than our 2 MPH pace. When T-Bird and I finish getting our water at the spring we head back up to the trail and we find Steady there talking with another hiker. She confirms that she's feeling good and going to camp 10 miles in at a campsite on Guthooks. It's right up the next climb. I've got lot of water because there's no spring or privy at Yellow Springs campsite. That climb was long and persistent over 2 miles but the grade wasn't bad and this 13.4 mile day really felt great. The temps were great, the terrain was great and it seemed to roll by. I spotted a porcupine by the edge of the trail. He was very cool, I've never seen one so close. Great photo opportunity! One concerning thing is that we kept hearing these loud booms. It wasn't raining yet today but heavy rain and flash flooding were on the menu for after 2pm. Oh joy. I like hiking alone a lot. I can pee ( or poop) when I need to and it's not awkward. When I'm hiking with Brian I can tell him I have business to do. But I'm hiking with a stranger. It's different. If it were a female I'd feel comfortable, but T-Bird is a man. I need to do #2. Yes, in the woods....there aren't toilets along the way. We had agreed that we'd stop at a campsite and historic marker noted in the book for lunch. We find a rock and T-Bird runs off down the blue blaze trail to find the men's room. When he comes back I grab my potty kit ( consisting of a trowel, TP, wipes and sanitizer) and I wander down the blue blaze trail, step off trail and dig a cathole. What a relief. Except the booming sounds are louder now and I hear machine gun fire also. I walk back up to the rock where we snack and head back out. As we continue we pass a few more campsites. By now I assume we're close to a military base and the booms are mortar and the guns are artillery. We finally arrived at Yellow Springs campsite and Thumper is there sitting on a rock by a fire ring eating dinner. She looks relieved to see us and expresses the same when we walk over. She was starting to think we might not make it and she'd be alone there for the night. Guthooks has a review about the site being haunted. I make camp next to her and go over to the fire ring and make my dinner. I've got chicken vindaloo tonight. Perfect! While I'm eating Rx and Field Trip come into camp and set up. After dinner I brush my teeth and grab my bear line. I head off towards the woods and T-Bird asks if I'll hang his bag on my line. So we go out together to look for the perfect limb and I see it right away. Except it's already got a bear line on it ready to go and doesn't look like it will support 2 more bags. So we scout and search and I try a couple of others but they are obscured by smaller branches and leaves and I can't get my line around it, it keeps getting caught up on the obscuring branches. Finally T-Bird locates a limb not quite as high and is able to toss the rock sack over it. We string up the bags and T-Bird ties it off the old fashioned way, not PCT style. I don't care, I'm tired and I want to crawl into my tent. I'm excited to be in my tent after a few rainy days of shelter sleeping. I dive out of site for the evening before the rain comes in. I ready a gallon plastic bag near me and anything else I'll need because the rain is moving in. I'm not getting out of this tent in the middle of the night to pee and get all cold and wet. Its cool out so I sleep in my wool and fleece. The mortar and artillery fire continue until 11pm when I hear taps. That's late. I have trouble sleeping because my legs are restless and it's keeping me awake but after taps I'm able to finally drift off.....and I hear the wind and the rain. Heavy on both accounts.","Peter's Mountain shelter
",Yellow Springs campsite,"May 18, Fri",13.40
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591451,"Last night I was awakened several times by chill, heavy rain and heavy wind. Unsettling. I know that the forcast was for heavy rain and flash flooding. I wake up fully around 6am and I can hear someone packing up. I think it's Rx. I also hear Thumper tossing and turning in the tent near me. These noisy sleeping pads! I stretch with a little yoga and then open the valve of my sleeping pad to begin the process. Its 6:30 and It's still pouring rain out. I don't want to look but I can't help but see it and from inside I can see all the black dirt splashed up on the sides of my tent. I dread cleaning it, it's a very messy thing and I'll have to pack it out filthy and soaked. But it's a great tent and I'm safe and dry in it for which I'm extremely thankful. I packed up everything inside and stuffed it into my pack then went outside and emptied the gallon Ziploc I peed in at 1:30am ( glad I kept that handy!). I said good morning to Thumper thru her tent and she was surprised I was up and nearly ready, she hadn't heard me. T-Bird was up and came over to see when I thought we'd be leaving. He'd grabbed his food bag but left mine and the bear line out in the woods. I asked him if he wouldn't mind fetching them for me and he did and brought them back to my tent. I unhooked the top of my tent from under the fly and released the corners from the poles, released the clips and stuffed the tent into it's bag. With the copper spur 2 I can erect and take down the tent while keeping it dry under the rainfly. Unfortunately the sides and bottom we're soaked and muddy but the inside remained dry. I then took down the fly and shoved it in the exterior mesh pocket of my backpack so it wouldn't get the tent soaked. I put the mud covered footprint in it's bag, stowed the poles in the outside pocket and put my pack cover on.  Standing in the rain I ate a fruit leather and something else out of my bag that was convenient but I knew it was only about 200 calories combined and it wouldn't get me far. Rx and Field Trip had already left. There was one tent left in camp when Thumper, T-Bird and I hiked out together just after 8am. We stayed together all the way in the pooring rain, T-Bird in the lead with a determination and 2 MPH pace. Like soldiers we marched over 9 miles ( which felt like 20) down the sodden and mostly flooded trail thru huge puddles and boot sucking mud. We tested our ankles by walking on the sides of the path, sometimes straddling it trying to keep our feet as dry as possible for as long as possible. It was cold, only in the mid 40's and I had my base layer on under my rain jacket and my t-shirt on as well. We were all getting soaked right thru rain gear and we kept the pace to stay warm. We stopped only once at the blue blaze trail to Rausch Gap shelter 5 miles down the trail. I tossed 2 cheese sticks and another fruit leather down and we threw our packs back on. T-Bird was already cooling down he said and it hadn't been 5 minutes. Wet and cold are a terrible combination. The water in the trail became so deep and with no way around it and no rocks to step on we had to finally give in. It came over and into our boots and trail runners and the sponge like squish remained for the duration of the hike. At the bottom of Rausch Gap the water was screaming across the trail and down to the river. The sound of the volume of water down the river reminded me of Diana's Baths up in Franconia Notch. Loud and voluminous water. It is a very powerful sound. The state game preserve was next, where a controlled burn had recently been conducted. You could still smell it. It had a good climb to it and lots of fresh blow down that had to be climed over or routed around. With the continuation of the artillery fire it felt eerie.  I felt like a contestant on survivor or naked and afraid ( but with clothes on) looking for the extraction point. The plan was to get out to PA 72 and get an Uber, but to where we didn't know yet. Thumper had called the Fairfield yesterday but it was $200 a night and Day's Inn said they were booked and the KOA required 2 nights stay and we didn't know if they even had a cabin available. When we made it out to 72 at 12:30  the rain had let up. Rx and Field Trip were waiting for us at a turnout on the side of the road knowing we weren't far behind. I called the Comfort Inn and they had 2 rooms left so I took them and got a discount rate of $130 each after asking for a hiker rate as mentioned in AWOL guide. We summoned 2 Uber, one for the guys and one for me a Thumper because there wasn't an XL Uber available that would take all 5 with gear. The guys ride picked them up in 10 minutes. We had a wet, cold 25 minutes to wait. I texted the driver and let him know we were wet hikers with packs, out of courtesy. We did jumping jacks on the side of 72 to stay warm enough. Then Rodney, our Uber driver surprised us. Rodney pulled up in a Chrysler 300 with the heat on high and a thermos of hot coffee he shared with us. He received a really nice tip when he dropped us off at Comfort Inn and helped haul our wet packs out of his trunk. Rodney had never picked up hikers before. Great service and very thoughtful! Rx and T-Bird were wet and waiting in the lobby because the rooms were held in my name and they couldn't check in without me. Field Trip had been dropped off at another hotel. At the same time River, who stayed at Rausch gap last night and had a shorter hike out was dropped off by her Uber. Her wife had called ahead and reserved her a room. Sweet! River's driver had taken her to the post office and to Moose's for lunch so she was warm and fueled when she walked in. Plus she had her resupply box which made her the most happy.  We roomed next to and across the hall from each other. Tramily, sharing laundry, first aid supplies and support. River shared beer and extras from her resupply box. It was a very long afternoon and evening. It's not relaxing in town like you might think. Everything takes time. We rely on Uber, shuttles or angels for rides. We showered and changed, did laundry propped our boots on hiking poles by the heater (cranked on high) so our rooms smelled like wet boot saunas. This is not glamorous! We took turns wiping the mud off our tents outside at a back entrance area with old newspapers that we got from Crystal at the front desk and also used some to absorb some of the water from our boots. We took a break from the drying out and cleaning to eat and get resupply at the grocery store. I needed 2 days cold food because until I get fuel I can't cook. Waiting for rides takes forever. Fueled up we returned to our rooms to finish taking turns drying out tents and rainfly over the shower curtain rod and propped up on anything we can find to place in front of the heater. I'm exhausted. I'll deal with packing it all up in the morning. At least for tonight it's dry and ready to go. I need rest now. Tomorrow morning we'll be back out there! It's almost 11pm, well past hiker midnight.","Yellow Springs campsite
",PA 72 mile 1180.9,"May 19, Sat",9.30
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591495,"I didn't sleep well last night. More restless legs and not being packed up and ready for departing left me anxious. I got up at 6, showered and packed. Thumper wrote a note to remind me to pack my food from the fridge. I'm taking the opportunity to pack out some cheddar cheese, Lebanon bologna and a salad kit. I'm planning to start having a lunch break of 45-60 minutes for rest each day now that my miles are increasing. I need to keep myself fueled, rest my feet and enjoy what's around me. The Comfort Inn serves a breakfast from 7-9am so I make my oatmeal in my room and carry my freezer bag down to the breakfast room. I'm sure it looks strange, but I don't have the same concerns that I used to about what other people might think. I'm sure I look funny in my attire also, skirt with men's hiking boots full of mud and wool socks. But I'm comfortable with me. Finally. 
I enjoyed my oatmeal, grabbed a banana for potassium and some eggs and sausage. The TV is on and I see the volcano in Hawaii for the first time. It says 4 more homes destroyed and I say a silent prayer asking God to keep people safe. Material things matter less and I myself notice that more out here. People matter. When I finish I let T-Bird know I'm calling Uber and say goodbye to River and Thumper who've arrived for breakfast. They'll be behind us but we all plan to be at the 501 shelter tonight. Javier the Uber driver arrives within 10 minutes and takes T-Bird and I to the previous day's extraction point. It's not raining today but the trail is a mess in areas. We walk down thru beautiful rhododendron forest and stop at a bench overlooking the road and the Swatara state park and the Berlin Iron Bridge over Swatara Creek, a tributary to the Susquehanna River. The creek has overflowed her banks and the low lying areas immediately next to her are holding it in. The creek is muddy but beautiful still. We have a short road walk and pass under and up along the side of I-81.  I wonder how many people passing by know this trail is here as T-Bird goes ahead and I stop to pee. This morning has already been tough and slow. It's hot and humid in the mid 80's and I think I left my trail legs back at the hotel as I ascend a very steep climb where the trail has become a brook. I'm hoping not to get wet feet again. My boots are waterproof, but eventually the water will get in. It's a tough climb and it goes on forever with part of the trail looking like a brook with water runoff from the rain still.A little flatter ground at the top of the climb but not much....and then I see them. ROCKS. The dreaded PA rocks in all their glory. It's not raining, which is nice, but the rocks are wet. I bend down to touch them because I can't believe they're not slathered in olive oil. That's how they feel under my feet. Slippery as all get out! I stop for a selfie on the rocks and text it out to Brian who immediately sends back a message of encouragement telling me that I rock, pun intended I'm sure. T-bird is ahead and I don't care how far he goes. I hear him talking with Hoot who passed me. I've got all day to get safely through this tangle. I can't take my focus off my feet and my poles. Carefully and with precision I calculate and choreograph each step. These rocks are different friends, they move.... even the huge ones sometimes. And other jagged ones are on end, sticking up. Sometimes when you think you'll step on a soft pile of leaves in between rocks, it's a hole covered by leaves. Trust nothing. And I'm watching for snakes occasionally too because Timber Rattlers  and Copperheads love the rocks  I now consider the AT ( called a footpath) to be an ""obstacle path"". Each step seriously messes with balance and impacts every bone in your foot and ankle. Slow and steady we make it thru multiple scrambles and rocky sections . There's an incredible amount of fresh blow down  after that and we detour around or venture over or under. It's a lot of extra work navigating thorns and poison ivy too. 8.7 miles in we arrive at William Penn shelter. Our targeted lunch stop.We hike down the blue blaze trail cursing all the time that we will have to hike back up it and we drop our packs at the picnic table. There's a nearly new privy we passed on the way down so without my pack on and feeling light I hike back to it and take advantage of it. Back at the picnic table we're the only ones there but the place is abuzz....with bees. Big fat bumble bees and small wasp type flying in and out of the shelter and the now vacant knot holes in the logs and of course around us. I'm pooped and so is T-Bird. We were hoping to make the 501 shelter but today kicked our butts. We decide to have a 1 hour lunch break and assess. But I already know I can't stay here!  I shared my bologna and some cheese with T-Bird who was delighted to have such a treat and we rest with bare feet for a while. I tried to lay down in the shelter but it's soot stained, dark and the bees are irritating so instead I opt to change my mood by sending a Marco Polo message to Brian. Thinking of him makes my day. Every day. I miss that man!After an hour we decide we'll hike back up to the trail and across it to a spring .10 on the other side and filter water. We agree we're both weary and our feet hurt still, so we'll stop at the next campsite shown on Guthooks, another 2.2 miles rest and assess again. We fill our water and meet Itchy and Scratchy on the way out. They look beaten. They're low on food but the day has been too hard and long and so they've skipped their planned resupply stop.  They're trying to make the 501 shelter because it's the only shelter where you can get pizza delivered. This will help them stretch their supply. The trail opens up and the terrain gives us a bit of a break.  Softer footing is a welcome relief. We hike 2.3 miles before we realized we hadn't seen a campsite yet and check the map.  There's no way we missed it. We agree to go on to the next viewpoint. Then the gentle trail disappears  quickly as it appeared and the rocks are back. Sharp and jagged ankle twisting foot manipulating rocks. Exhausted, we arrive at Fisher Overlook and I'm lifted by the view. A beautiful overlook of scenic farmland in the valley below. We met Hobbit on the climb after I-81 this morning, on his 3rd thruhike, and he said the views wouldn't be great. But I disagree. It's precious, this valley view. The hard working farmers with their perfect fields and beautiful silos. There's a heartbeat down there and I sit and feel it for a while. It's a beautiful country this America. We're so very blessed and sometimes we forget to stop and notice that. I can look around here, smell the honeysuckle. My focus is food, water and shelter. I have all day to work on that and nothing clouds it. Nothing distracts me except the beauty of the landscape and the people along the way, which I finally have time to stop and enjoy. My goal is to notice and enjoy more along this journey. To practice relaxing and enjoying life more instead of rushing to complete tasks all the time. Life is more than a task. Life should not be a race to the finish line and I no longer want to feel as if I live like it is. Being a bit refreshed from the Vista we move on. There are 2 more beautiful vistas about a half mile away, over rocks. I enjoy each one equally. At the last one there's a couple sitting on the rocks sharing a picnic. I feel like I'm interrupting a moment and I wish Brian were here with me. I'm longing to enjoy more memories with him where we're both in the moment and undistracted, like it is out here. After pausing for the last enjoyed view of the day there's a short climb. I can hear the road and I know we're close to the shelter. I see a blue tote. It's trail magic! Brian will confirm I don't like or drink Gatorade. But today is different. Ice cold bottles of lemon lime Gatorade await in the cooler. I drink it smiling almost crying. Thank you! It was delicious! So I have evidence that I fully enjoyed this, I have T-Bird take a picture of me drinking it and I text it to Brian. He's proud of me. I'm telling you, that was the best drink ever!!!!! Feeling almost new, except the pounded feet, we finish up the trek to the shelter and score 2 bunks. 501 shelter is fully enclosed, has a chemical port-a-potty and a water faucet, clotheslines, picnic tables, trash and recycling. Yay! We get set up and T-Bird and Professor order from the pizza place but they need a $15 order for delivery and they're short. I packed out a salad for tonight but it's not enough calories or protein. I order a small fry and a root beer and I mix up some bean dip from my dehydrated food stash and break out the lime tortilla chips. Thumper arrives along with Rx and I share my food with them. The 501 has a caretaker also. Borderline is his name. He lives in a little house next to the shelter. Because it's so close to the road, people who are not backpacking sometimes try to abuse it. It's for Backpackers only. No alcohol and other rules are explained to us and we agree to report the invasion of anyone not a backpacker should that occur. Then Borderline puts a power strip out on his front porch for anyone to charge their phones. Very kind. River makes it to the shelter just before dark grabbing the last bunk, and we all agree that was one tough day! It's lights out and once again I have restless legs keeping me up. I leave the shelter and walk to the privy and back. I crawl back into my bunk and practice breathing, deep belly breaths trying to relax. Eventually I'll fall asleep. Fully enclosed the shelter feels more comfortable.","PA 72 mile 1180.9

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591515,"I slept okay. Just okay. The man in the bunk above me dropped something on me while I was sleeping. It woke me up but it slipped off my quilt and onto the floor making noise. He then proceeded to recover it, putting his headlamp on which shown down between the wall and the bunk onto my face and he climbed down and under my bunk until he finally got it. I went back to sleep after and awoke with the sun as usual. This shelter is neat. It was a potters studio so it has a big skylight in the middle where the potters wheel once was. The ATC acquired it some time ago and it serves as a nice shelter for 14. Professor and another man, I think it was Bama Dog have a full conversation. I do wonder why some people might think that because they're awake everyone else should be too. I think that only applies on Christmas! Regardless, once they leave I decide to get up and slowly get ready. The 5 of us are still wondering what the heck ran us over yesterday and we're slow moving.  It's my son Kyle's birthday today so I call him to wish him a special and happy day. I get to  talk with him and his girlfriend Lisa also and we talk about what they may do to celebrate his special day, which he's taking off work. I hope whatever they do they make a beautiful memory. It's latest I've left a shelter and it's 9am before I am fed, brushed, packed and on my feet. Today's plan is to head to Rock N Sole hostel. I'm super excited to get there and get my supply box from Brian. Last night before bed I texted the hostel owner Craig and reserved Trashy. A 1958 restored camper for 1-2 people. I'm going to sleep like a baby in my private boudoir!This morning Rx suggested taking a zero at the hostel because the forcast is for rain Tuesday and he's got shin splints. I thought for about 10 seconds and I was sold. A zero makes sense to me with my tired feet and my left eye feels like a stye forming. Before I left the 501 I heated water and got a warm compress on it. I Texted Craig and told him to make it a double for me. Thumper wasn't sure she wanted to zero so we hiked out of the 501 with 4 on board and 1 on the fence. What a gorgeous blue sky day! Terrain was not as bad as yesterday but still lots of rocks and some slow going. An easier day emotionally too, knowing that we have a place to stay and we don't feel pressured for time. Thumper and Rx are ahead of us and River is behind. Myself and T-Bird in the middle. But we're not near each other and I am enjoying hiking alone right now. I like to be alone sometimes, at my own pace with my own thoughts. I'm just taking my time today. When we get to 183 we'll call Craig and he'll come get us. I forgot to tell you something about yesterday. As we were hiking up near the top of the never-ending climb, scrambling on the Rocks, two uniformed gentleman approached us from behind in Army khakis. Except they were British. They stopped and spoke to us for a minute and said they were headed off to wrestle a bear, jokingly. An hour or two later we saw them headed south, and they stopped and had a further conversation. I'm not sure they understand what the Appalachian Trail is, but they are here working with the American Marines on the local base where we heard the artillery from. They're doing exercises and they come here every year for a couple of weeks to train together. They were up on the trail scouting it out so they could bring their troops the following day to perform some exercises. It was fun having a 5 or 10 minute conversation with them about how early our troops get up in comparison to them ( how they hate that morning horn), and how there not unhappy that they missed the royal wedding! Interesting men. Their advice on how to wrestle with a bear? Well they told me just to use a sharp stick. I've got two of those, they're called trekking poles.There were more gorgeous views today, inside and outside of the woods. Beautiful fern covered forest floor and scenic overlooks of the farmland in the valley below. Almost all day today was a ridge walk. This was one of my most enjoyable days on trail thus far. Despite the last section of trail. I truly enjoyed each step, and I stopped at each View and rested relaxed and just took it all in. It feels so incredibly great to be out here. At one view I met a young family with four children who came up a trail called shower steps as I was sitting on the Rocks enjoying the view and chatting with River who would caught up with me. The kids were fascinated with what we were doing our backpacks Etc. And it was encouraging to see at their young ages how much they really like to be out in nature. They wanted to walk the additional two and a half miles down the trail to see the waterfalls where we were headed, at Hertline campsite. What a great family vibe, and so nice to see the parents so interactive in nature with their children. Being on the trail makes me look at people a little differently. I have the time to be more inquisitive about them, and I'm less likely to pass judgment. I feel very good about that. When I arrived at Hartline campsite bumper RX and T-bird were already there. Thumper and RX had already eaten their lunch and soak their feet, and T-Bird was grabbing a snack. River was right behind me and we dropped our packs. I grabbed some tuna fish, crackers, cheese, my water bottle and a bandana and I headed off to sit on the rocks and soak my feet and enjoy my lunch in a spot that Thumper had suggested. It was such a gorgeous day. I bet we were there for over an hour having lunch soaking our feet and soaking in the day. I turned around to see T-Bird napping on the shore of the stream behind us and everyone looked so much different from yesterday. At peace and in love with the trail. Thumper was taking pictures of these neat little frogs that were all around us, and RX was doing a little rock hopping. River was sitting next to me soaking her feet with a wet bandana on her head. I can't really describe the feeling but it was wonderful.Eventually Thumper and RX progressed North up the trail with T-Bird myself and river behind. Not far up ahead, the trail became washed out. It was no more. This made it difficult to navigate, and we were forced to follow footpaths around what once was the trail which was now flowing with water. In addition, this is the most poorly marked section of the trail that we have encountered. Without the aid of Guthooks, it would have been almost impossible to know if we were still on trail. Thumper, being unsure if she was backtracked all the way to us. Once we realize that we were still on trail and still headed where we should be, Thumper texted River to let her know to stay right at the fork and so that she would also know there weren't any white blazes. After about a mile and a half to two miles of this, we came out to a monument. We waited there for River and when she caught up we proceeded to the road. Rx gave Craig at the hostel a call and let him know the 5 of us were there for pickup. Within minutes Craig arrived with a pickup truck. He hopped out and with a big smile welcomed us. We put our packs in the back of the pickup truck and all piled in. Willie Nelson and Hank Williams jr. on the radio bopping down the road, was a really great time. I could already tell that Craig enjoyed being a hostel owner. We arrived at the Rock and sole hostel. Professor and Sandals are here. Craig gave us a tour of the property which was very inclusive and descriptive about the amenities and the location of such. The hostel is amazing and these people Craig and Jody and their children go out of their way and truly enjoy making hikers comfortable and welcome. They don't treat us like trash. They understand who we are and what our Journeys might be. The two car garage is converted to a bunkhouse that holds 8. An honor System is setup and the refrigerator and freezer are stocked with Gatorade soda and ice cream. They sell canister fuel and other items, and free of charge they Supply mason jars filled with Q-tips Band-Aids and other things that hikers do not often have the ability to pack but find extremely useful. There is even a Keurig coffee maker and a microwave. Outside there is a sink with soap and an outdoor spacious shower with on demand hot water. There's also a chemical toilet which Craig built a custom privy surrounding for out of old used doors it's really a fun place. There is a hiker Lounge, which is a cleared area with about eight chairs and a couple of benches and in the center is a fire pit. It's close to the river and you can set the chairs in the river to soak your feet. Sugar is an 11 year old yellow Lab who runs the property and loves the hikers equally. A night here includes a free shuttle to the Dollar General dinner and breakfast. Unlike some hostels, dinner is not frozen pizza and breakfast is not frozen waffles. Jody is an amazing and thoughtful cook who supplies wonderful well-balanced home cooked meals to all hikers with such great pride. Our first night here we had grilled chicken breast sandwiches with roasted brussel sprouts and for dessert freshly baked cookies with ice cream. Dinner is served on the front porch of their home next to the bunk room. This is a lot of work. For $3 they wash, dry and fold my laundry. There are inspiring messages in the bunkhouse and on the porch. This is the day the Lord has made Psalms 118:24. Our daily bread booklets for the taking. I asked Jodi what inspired them to open this Hostel in 2016 and she couldn't tell me exactly why, because they didn't know they just felt a calling. But they use the income from this to provide college education to their children. Craig is a retired state trooper who contracted a disease from a tick a couple of years ago and has been struggling with that. He's quick to warn us that the most dangerous thing on the trail are the ticks. I'm not staying in the bunkhouse. I'm staying in a little 1958 retro camper that they have completely redone, and named Trashy. She's adorable, perfectly outfitted and extremely comfortable. I can have my privacy and yet enjoy the community here at the hostel when I feel like I want the company. It's my turn for the hot shower and I enjoy it 100%. There are fresh towels here, the beds have Linens and there are even loner clothing and loner flip flops near the shower house. Very comfortable clothing flannel pajama bottoms and tops just extremely cozy.Before dinner I skip off to the hiker lounge area and I call  Dad  it's his birthday too  we have a wonderful conversation and he shares with me that he's the healthiest he's  been in years and feeling awesome after his annual checkup.  He's been working hard at exercising and eating well. I'm really proud of him and I'm so happy because it means that will have him around a lot longer. He's really an inspiration to me in so many ways. After dinner I get some journaling done in the privacy of trashy and as much as I think about watching Lucille Ball's Long Long Trailer, I'm tired and this feather bed is so comfortable so I'm just going to Drift Off to Sleep. Tomorrow we will have Chase Drive us into Pottsville so that we can take a tour of Yuengling Brewery and enjoy a lunch together at the Roma. And by the way, Thumper is staying 2 nights too and taking a zero with us tomorrow.","501 Shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591595,"I slept like a baby last night in Trashy. My feet have been swelling so I put a small pillow under the sheets and kept my feet elevated. I ventured out to the privy around 1:30am and the sound of the brook made me want to go sit at the hiker lounge but I was sensible and went back to sleep. I woke up at 6:15 and dressed, brushed, used the privy and wandered over to the front porch where meals are served. Coffee is out at 6:30 and breakfast is at 7. I grabbed a coffee and sat at one of the already set tables. Music was playing from a cell phone thru blue tooth speakers. Orange juice, ice water and fresh fruit cups were at each place. I enjoyed my coffee. I love coffee, but to be honest I haven't been drinking much. Many days I have none. I guess it's just not the same out on the trail. Eventually all the other guests arrive and Jody puts out sausage egg and cheese casserole, home fries and homemade muffins. We devoured the meal and enjoy conversation with each other. After breakfast we retired to our quarters for a while. I opened my supply box and bagged up my food by the day into gallon Ziploc bags. It's cool and rainy and the forecast is for rain all day. Just before 10am Thumper, River, Rx, Sandals and myself are ready for Chase to drive us into Pottsville. We've planned a tramily field trip to the Yuengling Brewery for a tour and sampling and then lunch at Roma's. T-bird stays behind to fully rest his feet. Pottsville is an old mill town. Once a thriving coal mining town. It reminds me of communities in Mass and NH that were once booming textile mill communities. A little depressed but with great architecture and remnants of lucrative times and history visible. The tour was fabulous. I fully enjoyed the history of the brewery and the hands on family aspect of it. I also loved the tasting! Porter and black and tan are my favorite and I also tried Ben's dark birch soda. Yummy! After browsing the gift shop we walked a few blocks in the rain to Roma which came highly recommended. I had a gluten free Chipotle chicken wrap and an Italian salad. Absolutely delicious but I could only eat 1/2 my wrap so I brought the rest back and gave it to T-Bird. He enjoyed it and said he enjoyed the relaxing and quiet afternoon. By the time Chase picked us up the hostel was super busy and he was working alone. Craig and Jody had doctor appointments. The 60's siblings hiked into the hostel because there was no one to pick them up but they were just happy to be there and it didn't seem to bother them. They're full again tonight and I'm not surprised. Word is out on the trail of how wonderful this place is. We learned that Craig's doctor appointments maybe didn't go so well. They thought he had a disease from a tick but it appears they're not sure and it could be something more serious or even life threatening. I'm sorry they are going through this. I can feel the weight of it. Craig's Mom passed away a month ago and today would have been her birthday. Dinner was at 5:30 and it was delicious pulled pork with homemade BBQ sauce, homemade macaroni and cheese and broccoli. Steady arrived this afternoon and sat at our table. It was great to visit with her. We laughed as she devoured the broccoli first. Who knew broccoli would taste so good she joked. I agreed, it was awesome! Dessert came and it was warm brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Sandals is vegan so he gave me his ice cream and I brought my brownie over to the table where Rx and T-Bird were sitting. I'm not sure who ate it but I know someone did! After dinner I went back to Trashy and caught up on a few days journals. My little hideaway was a busy place with people in and out, some just wanting to see it and others like River and T-Bird visiting or getting my lueko tape or buying soda and ice cream from my fridge because the bunkhouse was out. I didn't mind at all and eventually it was after 9 and all was quiet. I finished my journal and went out to brush and use the privy before bed. It's after 10 now so I crawl into bed and prop my feet up again. I'm looking forward to another great sleep!","Rock N Sole hostel PA route 183

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591709,"I want to share a funny story about yesterday morning. And I'll let a little secret out that not even Brian knows....well he will when he reads this. I'm in love with men's underwear. Yes, you read that right. Wind Eagle told me about men's underwear when I got my new shoes at Dick's Sporting goods. I mentioned that when it's hot I don't like to wear leggings under my skirt but I want something like bicycle shorts without the padded bum. When I'm crawling over trees and blow down I want some coverage and also I could avoid using body glide on my thighs that way. She said she wears men's boxer briefs and loves them. She directed me to the under armour brand and I tried them. I love them and I feel it's really unfair that men have kept these from us for decades. Ridiculous! I know we women have ""boy shorts"" but trust me, those are not designed for the comfort of the wearer...there's a different intent there. Anyway, River wears them too and my only complaint about this brand is that they have a 6"" inseam and when I'm hiking the legs do ride up. At Breakfast yesterday before all the guests arrived River and I were talking about this and Sandals began to explain that he wears another brand Mack Weldon and they have a soft wasteband and an 8"" inseam. He dropped his hiking shorts to his knees and modeled them for us just as Jody came out onto the porch and saw him from behind and River and I in front of him. We all had a great laugh and the underwear debate continued as Chase went and got a pair of Meundies to show us. I'm going to try the Mack Weldon brand because the hem on the legs in wider and they're 8"". 
Last night I woke up at 1:30 to a thunderstorm and waited for it to pass then visited the privy. It's a good thing the honey dripper comes Wednesday because that thing is really getting full! For a moment I was concerned that I was sleeping in a tuna can but I was able to reassure myself and be comforted. I went back to sleep until 5:30 and then lounged in bed until 6:15 when I utilized the outdoor shower, brushed and dressed for breakfast. Another full house and I took a seat with Steady, River and one of the 60's siblings. Breakfast was amazing yet again with fresh fruit, egg casserole with veggies and one with bacon and a 3rd with cinnamon rolls. Fresh fruit, juice, coffee and water. Bittersweet, because we will pack up and leave after breakfast. I said my goodbye to Sugar and Chase and went back to Trashy to pack up my bag and be ready to leave when Craig returned from dropping the 60's siblings at Route 183. They're 3 sisters hiking together and they had no hiking experience. They spend 2 weeks together each year at Christmas. I think they're having a blast and I wish them everything they want from this experience. It's very nice to meet them! I said goodbye to Trashy and joined T-Bird and River outside. Craig returned in the Camry and we loaded our packs into the trunk and piled in. I thanked Craig for making us feel so special and genuinely caring for hikers. River agreed and thanked him as well and Craig expressed that he doesn't know if this will be their last season. He's lost his faith in doctors and is seeing 2 oncologist in the coming weeks. If his illness is determined serious or life threatening he won't make the choice to continue serving hikers. The mood is heavy. We arrive at the turnout by the trail and hug Craig goodbye. I'll pray for him and his family. Today's hike was nothing special. Lots and lots of mud to hike thru. No views. The first 6 miles went by rather quickly and just before Eagle's Nest shelter I heard a familiar sounding champagne cork pop. I thought for a minute and then I turned around and saw Thumper. She'd caught up to us. The champagne cork sound is actually her broken trekking pole. When it gets stuck in the mud the pole stays behind and the handle pops off in her hand making that sound which makes me laugh. I feel so badly but it's really funny. She's been dealing with this broken pole for over a week I think. She ordered new poles yesterday from a more experienced company and she's looking forward to getting them. I hope she gets a refund on the others, they lasted less than 150 miles. We all stopped at Eagle's nest shelter for lunch. Right behind us the 60s siblings, Steady and Rx arrived. Steady and Rx are staying there tonight. Rx is having a shin problem. Hopefully he can get it to heal and continue hiking. It was a nice lunch break. My regret is that we didn't soak our feet before heading out to finish the last 4 miles. We filtered some water in the brook and headed out to the muddy trail. Mud was the deal for today and one steep but short rock climb. At Phillips spring we watered up and carried it the last .40 mile to a small campsite just at the side of the trail where Thumper, River, Sandals, T-Bird and myself will spend the night. We enjoyed dinner together and conversation, cleaned up and hung our bear bags on the other side of the trail and Thumper placed her bear can nearby. By 7:30 I was in my tent talking to Brian thru Marco Polo and journaling. Then I discovered snack wrappers in my skirt so I had to get the bear bag down and put them in then hoist it again. Note to self, check everything before hanging the bag! I can hear the birds. River is next to me in her tent and she shared her ibuprofen with me so I wouldn't have to get up again. Tomorrow we will hike into Port Clinton and visit the barber shop where they love hikers and we can charge our phones and share a cup of coffee. We might visit a few other places as we hike thru. I've heard the steep hike into town is a knee crusher!","Rock N Sole hostel PA route 183
",Campsite at mile 1213.8,"May 23, Wed",10.80
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591924,"I slept very well last night and woke with the birdsong around 5:30. I stayed in my tent dozing until 6. Then I crawled out and went across the trail to pee and grab my bear bag. Sandals and T-Bird were already up. Within a few minutes Thumper and River were also up. Today was one of those days that you wish you could do over, and do better. At this campsite ( as is will all the trail side sites) there's no picnic table, privy, etc. So I sat on an unstable rock in the fire pit facing out and very uncomfortable making my breakfast. Oatmeal. When I poured the water into the Ziploc bag I did so with the lid on the pot which has a little pouring spout. The lid slipped off and boiling water spilled on me causing blisters on my hand. I grabbed the fuel canister because they get cold when you use them and held it on there but it was little help. I at my breakfast and packed up. I was on trail by 7:45 ready for 9.7 to Windsor Furnace shelter. The trail today goes thru the town of Port Clinton. So the plan was to stop there and have lunch, go to the barber shop and Thumper would get her new water bladder that was waiting at the post office which oddly didn't open until 12:30.
The first 3 miles were a nice ridge walk. The trail was a bit muddy in spots but it was a decent morning. Then the descent into Port Clinton began and the 1st half mile was a steady grade down. The last half mile was a knee crushing one! I'm pretty sure at one point I saw a runaway truck lane except is was for hikers! We took pictures and video, River was right behind me, but it doesn't do it justice. T-bird and Thumper were somewhere ahead of us. When we finally reached the bottom we crossed multiple train tracks and it's a good thing Thumper had texted with a heads up. Until you get across some of the tracks you can see the white blaze, so you're left wondering for a bit. I must say I'm impressed with the friendliness of this cute town. Immediately people were saying hello and one woman in her yard working asked us if we needed water. A man driving past stopped and asked if we were going to the pavilion and if we wanted a ride. The town allows hikers to stay at the pavilion for free. We were headed to the barber shop however, so River could get a haircut and we could get our passports stamped.  The barber shop is very hiker friendly and has a hiker lounge area with coffee and pastries, a power strip for phone charging and rocking chairs. There's a guest log as well. Frank is the owner and explained that we just missed the band. We had a good time there and saw the man who offered us a ride and another hiker. River got a haircut and the AT symbol shaved into the side. We charged our phones and to River enjoyed some lemon pound cake. I was jealous. We said our goodbyes and headed out to find Thumper coming in to get us. She'd been to 3C's restaurant for an omelet which a kind 85 yr old man paid for and then gave her a ride back to the barber shop. He'd been selling poppies for veterans and she made a donation. The picture of the 2 of them is adorable. It'll be a great memory. We all walked over to the Port Clinton hotel and restaurant together. T-bird and the 60's siblings had gone there for lunch and someone was going to give them a ride to Walmart. They were on the porch waiting when we arrived. River and I had a pound of peel and eat shrimp and fries each, and a beer. A summer shandy for me in honor of my hubby! Thumper enjoyed the lemon marscapone cake. We had great conversation with 2 women at the next table who had  just done an overnight very nice ladies who aspire to thruhike the AT   As were eating Steady came in. She's so bubbly and good natured. She slapped her hand on the table laughing and said (that descent was legit!) We all laughed and she plopped into a chair at our table. I love her personality. She's lots of fun. We visited and Steady ordered the shrimp too. We left her to eat it after getting and update on Rx. He's in pain with his shin. I'm not sure what will happen. They're staying at the pavilion tonight. T-bird was just getting back from Walmart when we left the restaurant and we met on the porch. We all packed up and headed out. It was about a 6 mile hike to the shelter and we knew we were facing a heck of a climb. It was 2pm and about 85°. A warm one. Too warm. The climb in the heat was brutal. It just sucked the energy right out of me and for a good while we were exposed to full sun on the rocky ledges of it. I had to stop several times and rest. My feet hurt so badly and I felt like my pack was 50lbs. I had a heavy food bag and water.It was a tough afternoon mentally and physically. I felt like this climb really broke me. I had terrible foot pain and toe cramps and I was upset with myself. I should have gone to the Post office and sent home a few things to reduce my pack weight. My leggings and my wool base layer. I could shave a pound or more. By the time we got to the shelter it was after 6 pm. Late for me. I was in pain, frustrated and tired. I pitched my tent up close to the shelter because it was the only dry spot and I layed in it for a few to rest. When I felt like I could stand and walk again I put on my sandals and walked down the muddy path toward the brook with my filter, bladder and bottles. I sat on a log, took my sandals off and put my feet in the water. And I cried. The first time I have cried like that on trail. I felt beaten. I saw River coming down the trail and pulled myself together as best I could but I was still on the edge. I'm sure River could tell and she asked me how I was and I cried again. I told her that today sucked and if there were a bus out there picking people up I'd be on it. After thinking about that I know it's not true. I wouldn't have quit, but I would have stopped to think about what it would feel like. After a few minutes of conversation with River and a hug I felt better. I returned to the shelter and made dinner, brushed and hung my food bag. Tonight I need sleep and tomorrow will be a new day. Bring it on!","Campsite at mile 1213.8
",Windsor Furnace shelter,"May 24, Thu",9.70
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592170,"I woke up in the middle of the night to the crashing sound of a falling limb. My immediate thought was that perhaps a bear was in camp getting at the food bags hanging near the shelter. But when I heard the sound of snoring from the shelter I began to question if the sound was real or I was dreaming. After all it wasn't followed by any other noise. I waited a while and exited my tent to pee and then went back to sleep until 5. I love the birds in the morning, their sounds are such a pleasant alarm clock. I'm so comfortable sleeping out here now when I'm in my tent. I felt like a new person today, the stress from yesterday gone and my feet felt ready again. I exited my tent to find my food bag that I'd hung the night before had been delivered right outside my tent along with my bear line compliments of River. I made breakfast at the picnic table after packing up then hit the trail with T-Bird. A quick stop at the privy on the way out made me wish I'd opted for Yogi style relief. That privy was nasty! This shelter is close to a parking area and thus easily accessible to people other than section and thru hikers who spend more time living out here. It's my observation that the people I've been around for the past 4 weeks take care at the shelters and in general on the trail. Leave no trace practice (LNT) is abundantly utilized. However at shelters and campsites within a short hike of a parking area there is almost always an overused ( or abused)  privy that is less cared for, trash or other things left behind. I also notice toilet paper, glass and other things at these areas that I don't notice at shelters further from car access. It's too bad that we can't all have the same respect for these areas. As we headed up the 1.5 mile climb to Pulpit Rock I was energized and happy. The view reward was a great place to rest and take in the beauty of this day. Thumper was already there when T-Bird and I arrived. River arrived just as we were ready to leave. While taking in the beauty I shared it with Brian, my Dad and Mom thru photos and videos via text. Being a holiday weekend I was just wanting to be close to my family and share with them. There were a few day hikers and section hikers showing up on the trail now because of the easier access and the holiday. I met a nice couple with a dog playing hooky from work and planning a 100 mile hike this summer with their 5 children. I love meeting people like that! Invested in getting their children outside away from video games and TV. It's so rich out here in things to see and learn. There's an astronomical center up here at Pulpit Rock but no one was around. Bummer. We moved on to the 2 miles of trail of rocks and boulders that brought us to Pinnacle. We followed the blue blaze and took a few pictures but moved on. The trail was kinder for a while and we took a break at a creek to water up and wet down. It's warm today. T-bird is respectful and turns so River and I can wash up with our bandanas and dip our shirts so we can cool down. We hiked down hill from here to the Eckville shelter on the side of Hawk Mountain Rd. The shelter itself is a shed sitting behind a caretaker's house with about 6 bunks. It's dark and feels like a confined depressing space to me.  Across the lawn from it is a bathhouse with flush toilet and solar shower. Solar shower just means cold instead of ice cold shower, don't let the solar fool you into thinking it's warm. There's no electricity in here and it's very dark and well, imagine converting your old wooden shed to this and you'll get a good picture. My feet were killing me and the toe cramps were getting worse. They take the fun out of this. As I was hiking today I concluded that this isn't right. I called Jeff at Outdoor 76 in NC and he kindly spent 20 minutes with me assessing my issues and concluded it's foot fatigue. It's cause is likely that I'm in the wrong shoes and/or insoles for me. He walked me through how to be properly fitted for shoes and said if I couldn't find someone competent to do it that he could help me on the phone with pictures of my feet at different angles and measurements from a brannock device. I called for a shuttle to Cabela's after confirmation they have one but my contact couldn't help me. I resigned to hike two 10 mile days and one 5 mile day into Palmerton so I could get some help. I can't take the continuation of the pain. Thumper was here when I arrived. She was on the phone arranging a shuttle for tomorrow morning from route 309 to the post office. This would mean 2.5 more miles for her today to a campsite Sandals was at and an early morning 9 miles to the road so she could get her package before 12:30 on Saturday ( tomorrow) and not be stuck in town until Tuesday because of the holiday. River arrived and we ventured across the street to the tenting area because neither one of us is sleeping in that shed! The tenting area was amazing, with lush green lawn that was freshly mowed with 2 grassy tent platforms and a picnic table. We had the place to ourselves! We set up camp. River jumped at the cold shower first. She tipped me off to start with my clothes on, so when it was my turn I did that. I soaped up my clothes, rinsed and then took them off and washed me. When I was done I filled a gallon bag with water so I could wash other other clothes and socks. River hung a clothes line and our bear line. I scrubbed socks and hung them up with my shower washed clothes. I prefer the gallon bag washing method. My shower washed clothes still stink and I put them in a separate bag inside my clothes bag because I can't wear them like that! We enjoyed spreading out and having dinner on the picnic table. T-bird came to see our diggs and was then disappointed with the shed accommodations but he was committed and didn't want to pack up and move. Despite the fact that the 60's siblings were there and I snores. Loudly. He did bring his food bag over and join us for dinner. After dinner we cleaned up and I spotted 2 hikers heading down the road from the trailhead. They came into the tent area and set up, 1 in a tent and 1 in a hammock. Not really social but did say hello as they passed. River and I said goodnight to each other, hung our bear bags and went to our tents. I slept without my rainfly because the weather was gorgeous with no rain overnight. After being in our tents for a few minutes a car pulled up at the side parking area used by the caretaker, where he has a no parking sign. There was a conversation between the 2 and she used the privy and then walked around the tenting area with a dog, looking in on River in her boxers and of course on me because I had no rainfly and was pretty exposed. She left after a few minutes and then River noticed the smell of marijuana. Our private sanctuary was certainly no more. I'll journal for a short time and say goodnight to Brian and then sleep.","Windsor Furnace shelter
",Eckville shelter,"May 25, Fri",9.10
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592202,"I slept very well despite being close to the road. I woke up once to pee and was really happy to see a few starts despite the bright moon. Very glad I opted to sleep with no fly. The birds were so absolutely cheerful this morning and I sent a Marco Polo message to Brian saying good morning and he noticed all the birdsong. 
We were up fairly early but I was trying to dry the dew off my tent, footprint and quilt so we didn't depart until 8:15 after breakfast and coffee. I actually enjoyed a cup this morning with River at the picnic table. I was able to get everything dry before packing up but I was concerned by the darkening sky. Today calls for showers this morning.  River wasn't quite ready so after a privy trip T-Bird and I headed up the road to the trail and took a right into the woods. Just as we entered the woods the rain started. I hadn't put my pack cover on. T-bird graciously grab it from the side zipper and covered it so I didn't have to take my pack off. I was grateful. We stood for a few minutes under some trees, partially sheltered from it and then with T-Bird's suggestion that we're going to get wet anyway we hiked on. Neither in rain gear because the temps will be on the upper 70's today. Once we we started our climb we warmed up and the rain was welcome for cooling. The rain and sweat dripped down my face and I licked the salty water off my lips several times. To rest me amply today we planned to stop at Dan's Pulpit, Dan's spring and the Allentown hiking club shelter and to camp 10 miles out at a Trailside campsite. We enjoyed our rest and snack at Dan's Pulpit with a nice overlook and the rain had stopped. We sat on rocks in the shade instead of the sun and River joined us. I had a Starbucks refresher package and poured it into 16oz of water and drank it.  When I was feeling ready we continued on but I missed the blue blaze trail to the unmarked Dan's spring. I was flying! There's caffeine in that refresher and when T-Bird caught up to me he commented on my speed, asking for some of what I'd had. Wish I had more!  When I looked at Guthooks to check on the location of the spring it was almost a mile behind us. T-bird was becoming very anxious about water. It's very humid today and we're sweating bullets. The next water is at the shelter 4 miles away. We conserve our water and slow the pace so we need less. T-bird is very concerned but I'm confident that even if we run out we can hike a mile or 2 without. When we arrived at the shelter and spring T-Bird had 7 oz left and I had none. We filled up and had lunch at the shelter. I saw River at the spring and she wasn't going to go up to  the shelter so we planned to meet at the campsite. Professor and taught me hello and goodbye in Mandarin. I gave Professor half a liter of my water so he wouldn't have to hike down to the spring which was quite a way. He looked beat and was grateful for the donation. We left the shelter and continued on from the shelter which was 7.7 miles into a planned 10 mile day. Because of my feet we planned to hike two ten mile days and then a 5 mile day into Palmerton. I was doing pretty well managing the pain and swelling with rest and ibuprofen. At the 10 mile mark we couldn't find the campsite listed in Guthooks so I texted River who was a mile back and let her know. T-bird and I would hike and stop at the next one we saw. When we found it we stopped at it. The site wasn't ideal. We'd have trouble setting 2 tents and a hammock and the site didn't feel right. I dropped my pack and walked .40 north on the trail to see if there was a better site. My feet were killing me and I returned having found nothing. While I was gone River had arrived at the site. She and T-Bird wondered if I could hike a little more and cross route 309 and find a site on the other side of it. This would be 12 miles today, and if I could do 13 tomorrow we could get me into town. I thought if I layed down and elevated my feet on the log and took 3 more ibuprofen I could make it. So River pulled out something for me to lay on and we made our dinner and ate while I rested. We'd be getting to camp around 7:30 and this way dinner would be out of the way. The plan worked and we found a site that looked good and gave us a 13.1 mile day. We set up camp after picking enough broken glass out of an area for our tents.  Again we're at a site close to a parking area and it looks like it's sometimes party central. I suppose breaking the empty beer bottles means they don't have to pack them out. River helped me with my underhand throw and we strung up 3 bear lines, brushed and crawled in bed. I couldn't sleep. I texted with Brian and tried to sleep but couldn't get comfortable because of the pain in my feet. I kept moving around and I could hear River was unsettled too. Then I heard ""Are you awake?"" And we laughed and chatted for a few minutes thru our tents. It was almost 11am and I heard her open her ibuprofen bottle. She'd texted a friend, Jo. Jo was going to be in PA Monday visiting her son and wanted to know where River would be so she could provide her with anything she needed. Jo is a hiker too and understands the needs of hikers. So River arranged that we'd be in Palmerton and Jo would be at our disposal for the day so I could get to an outfitter for proper shoe fitting and we could resupply. Having such relief, we both slept shortly after.","Eckville shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592211,"The rain held off and I woke up at 5am. I stretched before moving around in my tent to pack up around 6am. I could hear T-Bird, whom I'm sure we kept up last night by chatting thru our tents when we couldn't sleep. Then River was rustling around and it was clear we all had the same idea. Get packed up dry before the rain comes. We were successful in that, eating a cold breakfast we left camp at 7am and determined that we'd stop at Bake oven knob shelter for a hot breakfast 4.3 miles away. We'd need water then as we were carrying light, I only had half a liter but it was much cooler today in the upper 60's. The rain started as we were leaving camp. Perfect timing and we hiked with covered packs and no rain gear. Not far from our campsite the rocks started. The worst rocks we've seen so far and they felt like they'd never end. So brutal on the feet. We hiked up over knife's edge and Bear Rocks and Bake Oven Knob in the rain on wet rocks. All of us being thankful we weren't alone. We often tossed our poles down and climbed down backwards or butt slid for safety. The wet rocks were super slippery. River took a spill but was thankfully able to recover without injury. It took us 4 hours to get 4.3 miles to the Bake Oven Knob shelter. Half our normal pace. We were hurting and hungry and needed water. At the shelter we filtered water took off our boots and made a hot breakfast with coffee. Not having a privy and unable to wait T-Bird had to finally christen his trowel and make like a bear. Sliced Beets came in and joined us for a snack. His wife was slack packing him and he got to cross knife's edge without a heavy pack. At that moment I told River I could agree to slack pack the rest of PA. We texted Thumper who was hiking the same section with Sandals today and was ahead of us. She gave us some encouragement about the upcoming miles so we could determine what the plan would be. If we would make it to town or camp. With improving trail ahead we decided to call for rooms and a ride and get thru the rest of the miles to town. T-bird got the last bunk at Bert's hostel and River and I booked rooms in nearby Lehighton for 2 nights so we could zero and get errands done with Jo on Monday. We headed back out to finish our additional 7.8 miles to town. It did get easier after some more rocks and boulder scrambles and then the descent into town. The man at the motel had offered to pick us up in Palmerton, very kind of him. We texted him at the last mile so we could meet up at the junction of 248 and 873. We waited for him a while but were so happy to see him and sit down! My feet were throbbing and I couldn't wait to rest. We dropped T-Bird off at Bert's and headed to Lehighton and got checked in. I flopped on the bed and rested for a while. When I was able, I changed into my rain gear and River and I walked down the street to the laundromat and did our laundry. Sitting there in rain kilts and jackets with nothing on underneath eating granola and malted milk balls and laughing. Exhausted and in pain and hungry but having fun. We put clean clothes on in the bathroom and walked a little further to dinner at Saporos Italian restaurant. The service and the food were great and so was the conversation with Duck (real name Donald) who we struck up a conversation with as he was sitting at the table across from us. He's lived in the area a long time but didn't realize how close the trail was and was impressed with our hiking and thinks my husband is nuts. We had a lot of fun talking with him. A sweet man, very genuine and kind. I texted him the link to my journal and he might follow us along. We packed up our leftovers and walked back to the motel stopping next door for an ice cream sundae to go. I ate mine in bed with my feet propped up and a dose of ibuprofen. We made plans thru text to meet Jo at 9am and pick up T-Bird in Palmerton so he can resupply too.I texted Brian and even though I'm not a basketball fan the Celtics were playing the Caveliers for the series and game 7 was on, so I tuned in and we watched the game together in 2 states. When the game was over ( Celtics lost) we said goodnight and I fell asleep quickly.","Campsite at mile 1245.7

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592309,"I slept like a baby, woke up at 5am and went back to sleep until 7:30. Missing the sound of the birds I took a shower and then dressed and opened my door to let their singing in. I sorted out my food bag and made a detailed list of what I needed at Cabela's and Walmart. T-bird had texted River last night with a contact number for Tracy, someone who could slack pack us later this week. River called and made the arrangements for Tues. I grabbed some crackers for my breakfast and met Jo and River at the motel entrance at 9am and we picked up T-Bird in Palmerton. Jo then drove us to Hamburg about 45 minutes away after I confirmed Cabela's was open on this Memorial Day. We disbursed once inside, each having our own lists of needed items and I went directly to the shoes. A young woman was working with a display of sandals and I approached her and explained I'm looking for someone knowledgeable who can assist me in a proper fitting for new hiking shoes. Jess immediately turned around and retrieved a brannock device from it's stored location inside a cabinet and brought it over. She first asked me some questions about my feet and experience with hiking shoes and how many pairs I had tried thus far. She told me that she sees the long distance hikers in the store and is working on understanding our needs in order to better help us and that she just finished a book by Liz Thomas. Of course I know Liz (Snorkel) Thomas and Jess's disclosure impressed me. So she stuck right by me for about an hour as she measured my feet and directed me to the shoes that would best fit my feet after gathering a bit more about what I like in a hiking shoe. I was seeking low top non waterproof. The women's selection being small we moved to men's. After trying on a few pair and using the ramp to confirm a good fit I selected the Merrill Moab ventilator in wide to accommodate my swollen feet that swell more when hiking and spread more with an additional 35 lbs on me. Jess went and got a tape measure to further measure and assist with insoles but because of the wide shoe there were no insoles available in the store that would work. Jo came over to me and asked me if I wanted her to mail my old shoes home for me and it choked me up. I didn't have to ask, she already thought of it. I hugged her. 
I met Dozer in this department too, looking for lambs wool for blister care. I wished I'd had my pack, I would have given him some. He'll likely have to order online. I ventured up to camping and picked up a few items there, some GF Mountain House meals to get me thru 3 days. I bought a lemon lime Gatorade and I'll confess it didn't taste nearly as good as the trail magic on the way to the 501 shelter. We all met back at the entrance and the next stop was Round Robin for lunch where I had a huge salad with avocado and other delectable ingredients and a cup of chilli. River and I paid for Jo's lunch and Walmart was next on the list. Conveniently there was one right there. We all finished up our resupply there. I got some lightweight pajamas so I could send home my wool base layer and some new men's underwear with longer legs. After Walmart Jo stopped at McDonald's so y could get an iced coffee and then Wawa so T-Bird and River could get their coffee and drove us all back to our respective accommodations. I quickly packed up what was being sent home and gave it to Jo to mail with money to cover it and some for her trouble. I then sat in the chair outside my room and soaked my feet in Epsom salt soaks inside Ziploc bags while catching up on my journal. It was relaxing. What a great day. I texted with Ambassador who is taking some zero days in Port Clinton, resting and waiting on a package. She's in some new Merrill Moab ventilator boots herself and liking them. I don't know if we'll run into each other again, but I hope so.  At 6:30 or so River and I walked a few doors down to the diner for dinner and carried ice cream back to our rooms so we could get our feet up and inflammation under control. I usually take tumeric in my daily supplements. But I haven't gotten another supply box and I only had 7 days, so I'm out. I arranged for another supply box from Brian and I'll have it Friday. He'll send me double the supplements so I don't run out again. I watched the 1st episode of the bacheloret while texting Brian and enjoyed my ice cream. It's 10:30 and I'm having trouble getting to sleep. I'm a bit anxious about tomorrow and the 12 mile slack pack with my new shoes. We'll be staying at Bert's and they have loaner day packs we can use, but water will be scarce and it will be hot and humid. I hope I can get enough sleep.","Mile 1257.8 PA 248 and 873

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592945,"I slept pretty well and woke up at 5am, stayed in bed until 5:45 then showered and packed up my bag so I'd be ready. I walked a few doors down and sat at the counter at 7am and enjoyed 2 eggs with ham and home fries and an orange juice. I was done and back at the motel by 7:30. I grabbed my stuff and met River in the lobby where she was having breakfast. I summoned an Uber but none were available and after a few tries River called Tracy over at Bert's hostel and she came to pick us up. She brought us to the hostel where we could leave our packs and grab day packs and also pic up T-Bird who had stayed there. 
By 9am we were at the trail where we'd left off on Sunday and we were excited to hike Lehigh Gap. The initial climb prior to the rocks was steep and it's a warm humid day today. But as we began the ascent on the rocky face the fun began. I absolutely loved climbing Lehigh Gap. With light packs and stowed trekking poles it was a hand assisted steep climb and the view reward was amazing. I take back what I'd previously said about never hiking in PA again. I would love to hike this section with Brian!  I paused several times to look back at the view and the town below. I sat on a rock and envisioned a picnic up here with Brian on a day hike. Once we made it to the top it was a ridge walk for miles. The weather was supposed to be overcast this morning, but the sun was out and the ridge was miles of exposure. It was darn hot. We stopped at a shaded campsite for a break. River and I felt really gross and sweaty using these daypacks from the hostel that were likely previously soaked by someone else's sweat. Yuck! There's no water on this stretch except for an emergency spring that tests high for metals and another spring almost where we finish but it's a steep half mile down. We wanted to cool off only, we had enough to drink. But we missed the emergency spring none of us seeing the blazes to it and we were all looking. When we arrived at Delps spring another hiker had already gone down for water and was sitting on a log at the top resting. He recommended we only hike down if we really needed water. One of us has a fear of running out of water (and it's not me) so this was cause for discussion and reasoning. We only had 2 miles left and we were pretty shaded now. We decided to finish without a trip to the spring as none of us had run out of water. We ended at Smith Gap with Tracy there to drive us back to the shelter right on time. I showered and ran to the laundromat with mine and River's clothes, but my feet were very tired and the laundromat was almost a mile away. I threw in the load and grabbed a coconut water drink and a preportioned cup of pepperoni and cheese cubes and container of potato salad and consumed it while the clothes washed. River came in and took over the drying and folding while I mosied back to the hostel stopping at rite aid for ibuprofen and gel inserts on the way back. I changed into pajamas and then remembered I needed to get to the ATM. The 60's siblings were at the hostel and told me if I go to the ATM I should walk the extra half block to Claudes for ice cream. So with sore feet I totally did was River calls the toddler walk in my pajamas to the ATM and Claudes and didn't care. I had a strawberry sundae then cut my gel inserts to fit, brushed my teeth and rolled out my sleeping pad on the floor in the lounge area. The bunks were full. Steady and I opted to crash in the air conditioned lounge on the sofa and floor instead of outside in the very hot garage. We've agreed to slack pack 17 miles tomorrow and made arrangements for a 7:30 ride.  Lights out!","Mile 1257.8 PA 248 and 873

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592992,"I didn't sleep well at all. I was chilly on the floor near the window AC unit so I got up and went to the entry way and looked in the bins where the sheets and towels are for a blanket. I found nothing so I layed back down and fell back asleep. I didn't feel like dragging out my quilt from the bottom of my pack. I woke at 5 and stayed on the floor until 5:30 then dressed out in the entry way and walked outside and over to the bathroom. I brushed and washed up then walked down to the convenience store and picked up a bag of chips for later and a bottle of Starbucks frappachino which I drank right down. I walked back to Bert's and sat down for a breakfast. It was 7am. Tracy would be there at 7:30 to shuttle us to Smith's Gap. I was eating eggs with ham and home fries when River joined me. Today instead of using the loaner day packs we would take the suggestion of the 60's siblings and use our own packs for the day but without all the things we don't need for the day. I pulled out the trash compactor bag lining my pack, put everything I didn't need into it and put it in Tracy's trunk. She'd be dropping it off at Wolf Gap for me later today. We were at Smith Gap and headed down the trail a little after 8am. It would be a 16.6 mile slack pack and then another .6 to the shelter for 17.2 total. It was a long day today but I carried plenty of water and the weather was not as humid as yesterday. There was one only 1 view and 5 steady miles of rocks. We adopted the phrase the only way through it is through it. We put our heads down and hiked, taking a lunch break and a couple of short breaks. An hour from the road River texted Tracy for our rondevous and the timing was perfect. We emerged from the woods to see Tracy and the 60's siblings who she'd picked up at the end of their slack pack day along the way. She had cold water and Corona beer! This woman is awesome. River and I drank our beer and packed our gear asT-Bird went ahead to the shelter. When we arrived we all took a spot inside the shelter and then made dinner. There were a few other thru hikers there enjoying the fire pit. Tomorrow will be our last day in PA. I'm really excited to cross over into NJ!","Smith Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592997,"I'm not sure what time we left the shelter this morning. It was drizzling and foggy so it was a little later than normal. I didn't wear rain gear but dawned my pack cover and headed out after an oatmeal breakfast. Because of the fog and rain which we've had so much of in PA River and I joked about the views that aren't. I'm sure they're really there but all we see is the white cloud and we don't bother to hike over to them to look. 
As we were descending into a hiker parking lot we were summoned over to it by a man I have only heard of and until now never met. The man said come on over and let me get set up and cook for you guys as he hauled out a couple of camp chairs. I knew immediately this was Fresh Ground and his Leap Frog Cafe which he confirmed when I asked. I was surprised to see him this far north and absolutely delighted! He's been called by God to feed and love hikers. He travels around and camps as we do and cooks with an efficient and tidy set-up. First order of business was a mandatory hand washing and then we helped ourselves to soda, fruit, chips and such until our burgers and dogs were ready, complete with a delicious southern slaw. We enjoyed our time here with Fresh Ground and his Cafe. I left a donation in the bin and we moved on to Delaware Water Gap which was waiting at the bottom of the hill. River and I were going to cross that bridge today!We stopped at the church of the mountains hostel and said hello to Thumper and goodbye to T-Bird. The end of PA was the end of the line for him. We thanked the other hikers there for being so quiet and courteous this morning when they left. The bunk room here really smells bad. But we used the restroom and took a quick shower. Overdrive and Panther who hiked the trail last year are traveling thru and stopped by to visit with hikers. They offered to bring River and I to the bakery for a hot coffee and the bank for the ATM. We had a wonderful visit with them and admire their current travel plans in their customized suburban. Great fun! When they dropped us back at the church it was time for us to put on our packs and head to NJ. We still had 5.3 miles to go and it was getting late. My feet hit the bridge over the Delaware river and my emotions were high. I was exuberant and yet in tears. I made a Marco Polo video message for Brian so he could cross the border with me and I cried. He's my biggest trail angel and provides me more trail magic than I could ever get from anyone else. My being here is his trail magic and I'm so grateful. River and I stopped for water at a creek at the edge of a parking area and I used the port-a-potty there. Then we headed up a steady 3 mile ascent to the Backpackers campground and pitched our tents in the rain. We met Beach Bum and Irish A F there, who's uncle James had supplied us some trail magic a day or two before. After dinner we stowed our food in the bear box and turned in for the night. What a day. There had been something bothering me for a week or so. But we agreed that it was left back in Delaware Water Gap and we both felt lighter and more free now. We're so happy to be in NJ!","Kirkridge shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593031,"It was maybe the worst night of sleep last night. Both River and I had trouble falling asleep and I don't know why. Maybe because we hiked so late? I finally got out of my tent and peed and a while later River did too...but she put on her headlamp. She gazed in the direction of the Bear box and saw eyes. Not what you want to see at 1 am. She began clapping and whistling and talking and was genuinely fearful. The eyes went away and she was able to settle down and fall asleep. Until the porcupine started. If you've never heard the mating of porcupine Google it. It's quite loud and not what you might expect. After that we fell asleep again until 4:15 when the whippoorwill started. Good grief! We got up and packed up wet tents in the thick fog. I made some Mountain House scrambled eggs with bacon and had all I could do to eat them all but didn't want to pack them out so I managed. I needed to stop at Mohican Outdoor Center for my resupply box about 5.5 miles away but at this time was thinking I would hike on after that. River was going to stay on trail and have her friend Jodi pick her up in a couple of days for a zero. And then things changed. The humidity was evil and we sweat out everything we had as we hiked over 5.5 miles of rocks. The rocks obviously don't know we're in NJ now. And the PA rocks continue. I called it at about mile 4 and said I'm going to stay at Mohican and take a Nero. A text message shortly after from River said she was calling Jodi, she was done hiking. At the end of the trail intersecting with Camp Rd we found Fresh Ground and his Leap Frog Cafe, Thumper and another hiker. He'd had a busy day but he hooked River up with 3 hot dogs and me with chicken breasts and fresh cucumber with dressing. Delicious! Thumper spent 3 hours there resting so she could hike more. Fresh Ground gave me a ride to the Mohican so I could get a bunk and pick up my package....but of course it's never that easy. The center was closed for a private wedding. Misty looked for my package but it wasn't there. She drove down to the mailbox and found the delivery ticket. The post office doesn't leave them out there anymore because the bears eat them. So Misty got me a ride from her friend Don who came and picked me up and drove me to the post office. The clerk gave me all the hiker packages that were there for pickup and helped me carry them out. Back at the center Don helped me carry them in and he wouldn't take any money for gas or time. I enjoyed our conversation on the ride and found him interesting and very kind. River was waiting at the center for me and Major Tom was there relaxing. I charged my phone and took a free shower. Jodi invited me to her house for the night and she arrived shortly after my shower and we were off. We stopped at a deli for ice cream and beer distribution center for beer... priorities! And then Jodi cooked up some quinoa pasta and meatballs for dinner while we were entertained by Elliot her adorable dog. I dried my tent and shoes on the deck. At 8:30 I brushed and crawled into a nice waterbed while thunderstorms crashed outside. Exhausted!","Backpacker campsite mile 1298.9

We decided last night that Jodi would bring us to the post office so that River could pick up her resupply box and I could bounce my knee brace and extra snacks up the trail. Jodi made us a wonderful breakfast and we fueled up on coffee, made it to the post office and a quick stop at Mohican to grab the phone cord River had left there yesterday.  We were at the trail just before 10am for a 17 mile slack pack.The terrain was decent, small ups and downs all day, some road walking, a very cool frog and snake pond and views! Lots of time on the ridge. The forcast was for scattered thunder showers. We rolled along nicely and stopped for snacks and then lunch up on a nice view area. I rolled out my just received tyvek from my friends Dan and Jeanne complete with a note of encouragement from Brian and took off my shoes and socks to rest my feet. We were overlooking a pond or lake and we could hear people having a great time in the water. And then we watched the sky and saw the rain, which was rolling by. And then to the left the darkening sky and a roll of thunder. We scrambled to pack up, hoping not to have to hide under the tyvek! We were on our feet in record time and headed back on trail quickly away from the ridge. We escaped with only drops, and I mean just a handful. The last few miles were rough with rocks.We met a nice couple who were out for a 14 mile hike, trying to do NJ over the summer. We kept crossing paths with them and had some nice conversation. About 2 miles from the end for all of us River stirred a rattle snake and jumped back. Her shot of adrenaline must have been tremendous because I think I felt it. This snake was angry and rattled repeatedly for long durations. There was no way to sneak around him on the trail so we finally had to bushwhack around and back onto the trail. All the while I was hoping the rest of this snake's family wasn't nearby! It was a snake jam on the Appalachian Trail!River texted Jodi with our ETA in Branchville for 7:45 and we emerged from the woods and crossed the street just as Jodi was pulling in. Jodi had cold water and beer, cold washcloths and fresh towels for us. She's very special to River and I see why. She's been wonderful to me also. I wasn't going to go back to her house but the area accommodations were full. Jodi offered for me to spend another night at her house and she'd bring me back to the trail in the morning. I felt badly because it's 35 minutes each way and she and River were going to spend the day together tomorrow. My other option was 3 more miles to a shelter because you can only stay at designated shelter or campsites in NJ. I was exhausted and it would be dark when I got to the shelter. I accepted Jodi's invitation and once again she made a wonderful dinner of quinoa and kale, grilled marinated chicken and broccoli while we showered and River threw in our laundry. We ate and drank and then retired for the night. I'll be up at 6 and ready when Jodi is. I hope I sleep as well tonight as I did last night!","Mohican Outdoor Center mile 1304.4

I dressed and brushed and made my way downstairs and out to Jodi's SUV where my gear was so I could pack my bag. Then I went inside and enjoyed scrambled eggs with sausage and coffee. 
Jodi and River dropped me off at the trail around 8:30 and I was off to meet with Thumper 3 miles in at Gren Anderson shelter. From there we'd hike out together. I had the first 3 miles to myself and it was a cool and pleasant morning. Not far in I saw a parking area and a port-a-potty. It was clean and I made use of it and continued on. When I reached the Gren Anderson shelter there was a group of 4 men at the picnic table and fire pit and Thumper nearby just finished up with her packing. I was starving so we sat at the picnic table and conversed with the guys while I made oatmeal and shared a banana Jodi gave me with Thumper. Thumper made us coffee and it was delicious! The guys had a small fire going in  the fire ring and they were peeling the bark of sticks to use for walking. After a trip to the privy, which was a very nice one with a trash can and sanitizer we headed out. It was an easy morning and we stopped at Mashipincog shelter for lunch about 6 miles in. Lucero stopped by but didn't stay long. The shelter was right on the trail and very convenient. The privy was just as nice as the one at Gren Amdeey shelter. As for the trail today, several ups and downs with no big climbs but a ton of boardwalks and mud. I find the boardwalks sometimes challenging because they're 2 boards that are often uneven and sometimes missing sections due to rot and almost always slippery. Going around and thru extensive mud slipping often is tiring as well as the constant ups and downs. These sections are where new trail names such as Mud Butt are founded!The last 2 miles had me dragging and my feet were very sore. Today's target was 16 miles for me to High point shelter. On the last rocky climb Thumper encouraged me with the news that it was less than a mile away. I emerged at the top to find Thumper at a wooden 2 story observation tower in a clearing. We climbed to the top and took a seat on a bench for a few and enjoyed the view and the High Point Monument. When we arrived at the shelter we decided we'd sleep in it since rain was expected. We made dinner and talked with Tyler who was out testing gear for his SOBO start in 2 weeks, his dad Keith who was with him and Maple Tree who arrived a little later. It was 8:30 by the time we brushed and stored our food bags in the bear box. Not long after climbing into our beds the rain started. Good choice being in the shelter!","Route 206 Branchville

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593500,"I slept okay, conscious of the rain which ended around 5am and the fact that Tyler next to me wasn't having a restful night. When we got up in the morning he said it was the worst night of sleep ever. We talked about some changes to his sleeping system. He's got a summer bag and a thin crash pad and no inflatable pillow. Sleep is super important on trail and something I sometimes struggle with in shelters. I sleep well now in my tent and getting a room in town as often as I feel I need to is helpful to me in feeling well rested and healthy. I feel like I'm always healing and the rest is critical. I hope Tyler is able to dial in what works for him personally and is comfortable on trail. If it's not fun it's not easy to stay on trail. I cooked breakfast and cleaned up, brushed and Thumper and I set off towards Pochuck mountain shelter for a targeted 12.4 mile day with a planned stop in Unionville NY for a quick resupply for Thumper. I bounced a box with snacks a few days ago up to Glenwood NJ for myself. I'm getting low on some things like protein for my meals because the tuna and chicken weren't in my box. I can pick them up here I hope. We crossed lots of footbridges and some more mud today. Pretty picturesque day in the woods crossing marshy areas and streams. When we arrived at route 284 I lamented on the road walk to town .8 on asphalt. Ugh. It's illegal to hitchhike in NY and while we're still hiking the NJ trail it crosses over the NY border a few times. As we approached the top of the hill headed into town a pickup truck will a man and 2 dogs slowed beside me and asked if I was a thruhiker. I gave him a short answer not wanting to stimulate conversation and he drove ahead to Thumper. When I approached them I did join in. Turns out George is a farmer and he mows the field by the trail ( and mows it wide so it's easier for us!!) And he loves hikers. George is an extremely nice man who gave us a warm and welcoming feeling and great information that we wouldn't have known otherwise. Unionville as it turns out loves hikers. Who knew!? He told us we could register at the village office or at the general store and stay in the park. The village office has a water spicket and the post office a power outlet. There's a clean port-a-potty and a gazebo. The former Mayor changed this town years ago into a hiker loving community and as a result they love each other more. A great feeling here and I said to Thumper, let's just Nero here today. How can you not stay here and feel the love and embrace it?We sat on the porch at Horlers general store charging our phones and ourselves. Locals walking by and visiting the store all spoke with us. I updated my journal and ate and drank and we registered for a night in the park. We did laundry in gallon bags and hung it to dry. Super stoked to be here. Probation Termination was also in the park set up. He was waiting on new shoes that would be delivered to the post office around 4pm. Thumper and I had dinner at the Tavern where I enjoyed a pound of ribs and french fries and a beer. There's a charging station, journal and hiker box there too.  While we were eating we saw another hiker come in and go to the far back corner. When he passed us we invited him to join us for dinner and not eat alone. Lorax is on his way from Pen Mar Park to Katahdin before his fall semester in Maine starts. He's going for his PhD in chemical engineering. Smart cookie and very social and good company. He's having foot problems because he wears a size 18. A basketball player. He is hiking in basketball sneakers because he has no options unless someone connects him with custom made hiking shoes. He can't even get insoles to help with the foot fatigue. There is no support in these sneakers and I empathize with his situation. I hope he is able to find a better solution. I wish I had a connection to a basketball star who could help this young man out! After dinner we went to Anabelle's pizza for dessert. Ice cream.

I waited a while hoping they'd leave so I could go use the port-a-potty. I don't think they realized 4 hikers were sleeping around the corner in the park not visible from the gazebo. I couldn't wait and had to get up to go. I went into the port-a-potty undetected but before I was done one of the girls exclaimed how much she had to pee and was surprised to find the port-a-potty occupied. When I exited she was startled. They left right after.

When the sun started appearing on the basketball court I moved my still wet laundry over to it along with my rainfly which was wet with dew so it could all dry. I walked up to the store and grabbed a resupply and breakfast of yogurt, granola, banana and coffee and ate it at the gazebo. The previous night's youth had left their soda bottles there even though the trash can was 2' away. I cleaned it all up because I didn't want people to think the hikers left it! I packed up my now dry things and Thumper and I headed out with our socks hanging on our packs to finish the drying cycle. Like hobos. We walked thru Walkill Wildlife Sanctuary on a flat and wide trail for about 2 miles, stopping at a bench for a quick snack. As we moved around the pond we watched a doe playing with her 2 fawn for about 15 minutes. She could see us walking in her direction and when she felt we were close enough she and her little ones moved away. It was sweet to observe that!More boardwalks today thru low wetlands and larger ups and downs. NJ loves the 2 board walkways but I always feel unbalanced. I hold my hiking poles in each hand so I can be steady. There's no way I want to fall into what lurks on the sides, sometimes mud and sometimes swampy water. There was a 1 mile wide and beautiful boardwalk over Pochuck Creek and a suspension bridge. There were lots of people walking here and a woman who I think said she was Marybeth and I had a nice conversation for about 2/3rds of it until I was back in the woods and she'd turned back to complete her walk. It was a beautiful area and nice to talk with her about hiking. I had just sat down on a rock to rest my feet and snack when Thumper texted me a picture of a large dish of ice cream telling me to turn left at the road after the cow pasture. I put away the unopened protein bar and put my shoes back on and boogied out the short boardwalk thru the cow pasture really hoping I wouldn't fall off the side and turned left. I found her on the front porch of Heaven Hill Farm. Inside was the sweet smell from the bakery, ice cream and fresh produce. I bought a tomato a small dish of ice cream and a mango lemonade. Strange combination I know but it's what I wanted. I devoured them while resting my feet. I was emotionally preparing myself for the stairway to heaven. We're just a couple of miles from the shelter but it's getting late. I won't make it there until 7:30 or so with the climb but I need the rest. Once restored Thumper and I headed out. At the bottom of the climb I saw a hiker stealth camping because he wasn't able to make the climb today. I took my time but the climb was sweaty and strenuous up the rock mountain. At the top I took the blue blaze trail to the view. It was nice but I didn't linger. I needed to get to the shelter. I arrived at 7:45 and most everyone was settled in their tent or shelter. I found a spot in between some other tents and set up quickly and then went to the picnic table to cook dinner. I quickly ate some rehydrated baked beans that my friends Glenn and Linda had made prior to my trip. I  had dehydrated the leftovers and it was nice to have them tonight and think of them. I brushed, stowed my food bag in the bear box and dove into my tent to blow up my sleeping pad and get some shut-eye.","NJ 284 Unionville NY mile 1346.2

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593513,"I don't know if I was dreaming but I thought I heard a woman say ""bear"" while I was sleeping. I didn't mention it to Thumper until she told me that Probation Termination thought that he heard a bear in camp last night. That stairway to heaven climb really toasted me and I slept well! 
Up with the birds as usual today I had a cold breakfast and packed up to go. Today I will cross into NY and check another state off the list! We stayed up on this ridge and while bumping along large rock slabs and some moderate rocky ups and downs. I met Slingshot, Capt Ron and Roundabout Reith today and we had some brief conversation about the rocks and trail. I almost missed the NY border when I came across it painted on a rock, but I abruptly stopped to photo it just in time and make a Marco Polo message for my husband so we could cross it together. It felt really good but not as monumental as getting out of PA! Just after that I was standing on the highest point of the trail in NY overlooking Greenwood lake. The weather has been wonderful, cool but sunny and perfect for hiking on the exposed rock. I saw a note in the AWOL guide this morning that reads "" despite the unimposing profile, rocks, abrupt ups and downs make this section challenging"". Hmm. I'm not sure that sounds like fun and early in the day I realized that's no joke. NY is pretty badass! 2nd only to the famed Whites! About now, since my legs are feeling the effects of the stairway to heaven climb I'm starting to feel like NY is about to kick my butt. The climbing is steep and challenging for sure and often I'm stowing my poles and using my hands while wishing I was slack packing this section. I came across a handy ladder in one section and was super grateful! Today did offer several nice views. At least there was that reward. Slingshot told me about hot dogs and ice cream in Bellvale at around noon or so. The hotdogs close at 3pm. For a while I think if I hike fast I can make it. And I realized soon that this terrain won't let me and I have to give up the vision of hot dogs dancing in my head. I settle on the ice cream because they are open until 8pm and I lumber thru the climbs. At 4:30 and on my last ounce of energy I get to the road and make a left toward Bellvale Creamery which is the longest .10 mile I've ever walked. I saw Lorax walking back to the trail and he said the walk was worth it! I got a strawberry sundae with coconut ice cream and the cashier had a hard time getting that. Not the friendliness I expected but the ice cream was delicious and the view outstanding. I suppose it doesn't help I haven't showered since Saturday! A section hiker Patrick joined us. After an hour and a half rest and refill of my water from their hiker station and a trip to the flush toilet with warm water and soap Thumper and I headed to the trail for the last 2 miles to the shelter. Again we'd be late arrivals into camp. When we arrived No Beer was at the shelter, Patrick, Early Bird, Thumper and I tented/hammocked down below. There's a lot of bear activity at the next shelter, Fingerboard. In discussion with Early Bird Thumper had decided she'll do a 19 mile day tomorrow with Early Bird to avoid it. In this terrain I know that's not possible for me. I'll plan to get off trail at mile 1384.3 and get a room in town to avoid that shelter and likely the next one. Before I arrived here tonight Thumper got water. She shared the water with me so I wouldn't have to go to the spring and I shared my fuel with her because she's really low and will need some for tomorrow. After my dinner and brushing my teeth I left her up at the shelter while she finished up and went down to my tent to finish setting up and get sleep. I hear the owls and listen for bear, a bit nervous now. I know NJ and NY have high Bear concentration around the trail. It is amazing how many wild berries are out here....the forest floor is covered in them. If I were a bear I'd want to live here too!","Wawayonda shelter
",Wildcat shelter,"Jun 06, Wed",12.10
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593526,"I woke up at 5:30 after a good night of sleep. I closed my eyes again and rested until 6:30. Thumper and Early Bird were already gone. I skipped breakfast not feeling like having the Mountain House scrambled eggs and bacon I was carrying and left camp at 7:20. The online comments for the shelter stated that the privy here was very full so I skipped that and took the blue blaze trail back to the AT North. Within a few minutes I was in the woods off the trail which I'm certain is more sanitary than that privy would have been. I munched on some granola and other snacks shortly after as my breakfast while sitting nearly 2 miles in at the base of Fitzgerald Falls. I hydrated, filtered water  and soaked my bandana while taking in the view of my climb. Ready or not it awaited me. When I felt ready I tackled it. Very slowly and with small steps I owned the 1.2 mile climb which I refused to allow exhaust me. I felt victorious and I took each additional climb (several of them) the same way. I was passed my Capt Black who would rush up the climbs and take a break on a rock. He was recently back on trail after 3 weeks off healing from a fall. I was feeling strong and needing fewer breaks by taking it slowly. My goal was less than 11 miles because I know already my body is tired and my muscles and joints sore from constant ups and downs. I had called a motel and reserved a $60 room for the night. I need a shower and laundry. After Capt Black leaped ahead again I took my fall. Thankfully I was near the bottom of a rock descent as I twisted my ankle and fell sideways to the bottom. Thud! Ugh! I'm sporting ugly bruises on my right leg and butt, however I am not injured thankfully! I crawled to my hands and knees and hoisted myself up, dusted off and took a moment to collect myself. 
Capt Black and I leap frogged for a few hours until finally I took my lunch at a view point where I found the perfect rock seat and got out my ball to roll out my feet while eating crackers and spicy Thai tuna. It was then that I received a text from Thumper who was 2.4 miles ahead sitting on the rocks exhausted and unable to complete her targeted 19 miles. She'll share the room with me if the offer still stands. I let her know I'd be a while because I'm taking it slowly, and she was there waiting for me when I arrived a couple of hours later. She was distressed to have learned of a family emergency while she was waiting for me. I felt very badly. We sat and talked for a few and then made our way over the last mile which as NY would have it contained more ups and downs for us and finally arrived at Elk Pen parking lot. Thumper summoned an Uber which arrived shortly after. A female driver for the first time. As the driver pulled out onto NY 17 she pulled out in front of a red car coming from the left. I couldn't even scream I was so shocked and Thumper went pale. Our driver paused when she saw the red car making the situation more serious. The red car slammed on it's breaks with smoke spewing out from it's wheels and avoided us. Our driver continued conversation like nothing happened. We were speechless. We both felt like we almost just got killed. The driver then dropped us off at the motel and expressed that it has a certain ""reputation"". We got out and stood there. At this point Thumper isn't sure she wants to stay. I'm just dazed. In the lobby I requested that we see the room before committing to rent it and the owner gives me the key. We check it out and agree that it's not glamorous, the beds are clean and we feel safe enough and we take the room. The owner washed and dried our laundry for us which was desperately needed. It was a tough night for Thumper with her family situation and the day in general. We ordered a delivery from a wonderful Italian restaurant and devoured it. We distracted as best we could by watching the Office episodes until bed time. The motel was quiet and away from the road. We will both hopefully get a good sleep.","Wildcat shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593571,"I woke up early and tried to be quiet because Thumper was still sleeping. I got ready for the day not sure yet if Thumper was going to hike today or what her decision would be. After getting up and assessing her body and feelings she decided to have her Dad come pick her up. I called for my Uber and gave her a hug and the room key. I hope everything works out for her. 
When the Uber arrives it's not the same one as yesterday. I will not get back in that woman's car! The driver dropped me off at Elk Pen parking lot and there was a car there with 2 day hikers getting ready to head south. It was just before 8am. I was feeling down so I stopped and called Brian from the parking lot and we talked for about 20 minutes. It was a mood lifter. Today I was hiking thru Harriman State Park. I headed off thru the field to face the first climb of the day. I continued at a snail's pace today just unable to drag my butt and my pack any faster. Every step a chore. I was happy y reach the lemon squeezer just under 2 miles in and did have fun at that, throwing my pack and poles up and over because I couldn't fit with the pack on. At the top of it I took the blue blaze trail around because the climb was vertical and I was alone. I haven't seen a hiker except the ones in the lot. About 1/2 mile North of the lemon squeezer I saw movement on the trail southbound towards me. It was a black bear. Yogi! But not the costumed kind...a real live life sized bear walking towards me. Oh joy! I stopped and took out my phone and started to video. He doesn't know I'm here. He appears to be thinking about turning east of the trail into the grass but then decided to continue south. At this point I don't want to film my own demise so I talk to him and tell him to go away. He stopped and looked and began to slowly head West off the trail and I stopped the video and stowed my phone. I proceeded to clap and make noise and blow my whistle a couple of times. Each time I paused he looked at me as if to ask ""is this far enough?"". When I felt it was I passed by on the trail and continued on my way. He was certainly in no hurry to clear the way for me so it seemed he was used to seeing humans. A short while after that I talked to my office and that was a bit of a booster too. It was awesome to hear their voices, it's been so long it seems. Their support feels so good!Harriman State Park is beautiful. A thinly forested park with a forest floor lush with blueberries, small streams and rocky balds. I lumbered thru smaller ups and downs than the previous days but it was a struggle. Lucero passed me and we discussed the bear which was still out on display. I mentioned that I might call it a 5 mile day at get off Tiorati Cr and she told me that there's a restroom, vending machines and water. She had me at vending machines and I suddenly had enough energy to get there. When we arrived the ice cream machine wouldn't dispense with my credit card and I didn't want use a $20 bill and get 18 heavy $1 coins. Lucero had a $5 so she gave me $2 in the coins and I gave her the $1 bill I had. That was very nice of her and I enjoyed an ice cream. Lucero had a bigger day and didn't stay long. I felt a bit better so I left to get 2 more miles in and I'd get an Uber at 7 lakes Rd. I arrived at 7 lakes Rd at 3pm and had no service to get an Uber or make a call. Frustrated I was being forced into 4 more miles I now felt a little pep. 2 miles from 7 lakes I called the motel to let them know I will still be there but it'll be 7pm or so. They don't hold your room with your credit card it's honor system and I don't want them to think I'm a no-show and give it to someone else. I also tell them that I've talked to River today and I'll share my room with her. At 6 pm I played frogger across the Palisades interstate parkway and walked left 2,000 feet to the visitor center and bookstore to find it closed. I had no service for an Uber and no quarters for the payphone that was there. If the wind blew right I could text. Frustrated I dropped my pack and sat on the concrete trying to think about how to get off this island. I could hike back to the trail and another mile to a shelter but I have just stuffing for dinner and an egg breakfast plus River is counting on me for a room. Everything else is booked or expensive. I text Brian, River and Kyle to get help. River is in an Uber on the way to the motel and when she gets there the owner and she come to pick me up. I'm happy to hear I'm not the first hiker ""stranded at the bookstore"". As it turns out I'm not in a large room and River ended up getting a pricy room at the Holiday inn Express across the street....but she's a doctor now. Kidding. There she runs into Sugarfoot who I haven't seen since Harper's Ferry. We showered and had a late dinner at the Barnstormer BBQ before sprinting back to our rooms for R&R. I enjoyed the blackened salmon and baked potato a beer.  River was kind enough to do my laundry for me. She'll by hiking tomorrow and I'll take a zero.

I got up at 7:30 ready to relax and recover today. I'll have to get groceries for the next 3 days and I plan to post my journal entries since I have electricity and wifi here. I showered and dressed and sat on the motel porch with my feet up for a while working on my schedule so I can pick up my next supply box and work out the food I need before then. Then I paid for my stay tonight and got a suggestion for breakfast and grocery store. I walked down the street a block to Perry's and enjoyed scrambled eggs with bacon, spinach, Swiss and potatoes along with orange juice and coffee. It's a little cafe at a Ducati motorcycle shop and there were several people there that sound like they ride together and one flamboyant female who was annoying but entertainment at the same time. I talked to the owner for a few minutes before walking back to the motel. I sat down again on the porch and received a text from Kyle asking me to call. Unfortunately I was reminded of how stressful my career is and the conversation left me upset and feeling guilty about not being there. I called Brian after so we could talk about it and I could begin to process. I'll have to work through these emotions and it will likely take me a few days. River stopped by on her way to the post office and dropped off some gear in my room. Today I get to help her slack pack! She'll be going to do the 11 miles I did yesterday. This way we'll be on the same trail sections again. Her Uber came and she was off after getting her boxes from the post office. Since I'm going to the grocery store I can pick up what she needs. After more journaling I summoned an Uber and headed out to get the shopping done. By far the nicest driver and there is a snack basket and cooler with bottled water in the back seat. Spotless car!  I have a specific list so I don't buy too much. I scored 2 oatmeal and some Ziploc bags from the hiker box, so I crossed those off the list. Uber took a long time to pick me up from the grocery store so I ate the raspberries and ran into Rite Aid while I waited, looking for body glide for River. It's so hard to find!Back at the motel I'm still in a funk about the news from my office. I pack up my 3 days of food into the freezer bags and into my food bag. I ate my kale salad after spilling some on the floor, I despise those bags, and spending 10 minutes picking up the pieces. Thankfully it didn't have dressing on it yet. It's almost 5 and I talk to Brian again. I'm trying to assess how I feel and work through it.I'm feeling depressed and wondering if things would have been different if I were at the office. Likely not. I can't control the situation. People make their own decisions of what's best for them at the time. Sometimes the grass just looks greener somewhere else and they jump over the fence. I feel unappreciated and dumped on. I have to give this up to God and refocus myself on my journey. This is my time. River finished her hike around 7 and got an Uber back. Apparently not all hikers get stranded at the bookstore. Having already eaten I declined dinner and watched TV for a while before bed. Animal Planet. A show about prosthetics for animals which was very interesting. Then a few minutes of news for the weather and I shut it off at 10:15 and put the AC unit on low fan. Another night of good sleep and I'll be ready for Bear mountain!","Bear mountain bridge motel

We headed back to the motel after discussing Rivers tent situation, which needed some repair to the screen mesh around the bottom. She had noticed the tears when she was taking her zero last week and had ordered the necessary repair screening which she picked up at the post office yesterday, so we were able to get the repairs done in about 30 to 45 minutes here at the motel together. The tent will be needed tonight and tomorrow because the only options for us are tempting, either 10 miles or 16 miles out. No shelters will be available to us this evening. So making this repair before we left today was imperative.I'm excited about today's hike, will be going up over Bear Mountain Crossing the Hudson River walking through Perkins Memorial Park and the zoo.Our Uber driver was nice with a London accent and he was thrilled to pick up my pack to feel the weight. He said it felt more like 55# to him. We left the bookstore and crossed the Palisades walking the 2000 feet to the trail. The noise and the traffic cause anxiety for me but once inside the woods I could hear the birds and peace started enveloping me. We had a nice climb talking with some day hikers and watching a flock of birds eat berries from a tree. At the top of the climb near the trail to West mountain shelter we enjoyed the view and our hard earned snack and met Erick, Andrew and Stuff Sack. Erick is hiking to Maine and the others are out for a week or so with him before returning to NYC. We ran into Rich, a trail maintainer and supervisor who was out painting blazes and we each got to paint one. It was really an awesome feeling. Climbing up the rest of West mountain was tough but I was elated to have painted that blaze. We crossed the street and started up Bear mountain for what I thought would be a tougher climb. Immediately we started to see an increase in the number of day hikers on the trail without water and some lost. We were asked questions like ""are we almost at the parking lot"", "" which way to the Inn"", etc. We tried to help as best we could but we only have maps for the AT and I think some of these people were no longer on the trail they started out on. The top of Bear mountain was jammed with people. Thru hikers were suddenly the minority and we were stopped and asked a host of new questions and for Instagram and journal information so they could follow us. That was pretty fun! We ran into Dozer, Napper and Riddler who we haven't seen since Cabela's back on Memorial Day. We hung out for a while at the picnic area and snack bar munching, using the flush toilets. Eventually we decided we should move on to make the campsite across the bridge. We missed the zoo which closed at 4:30 so we we took the blue blaze trail around with Bacon. When we got up the bridge the trail markings were unclear, as is much of NY unfortunately. We crossed on the right hand side of the bridge, a mistake. When we arrived at the other end we had to cross a 3 way intersection. We later learned that many hikers run into this issue because of unclear markings. As we walked across the bridge I had a sinking feeling that this Mountain in front of us was going to be an evening climb. I was right. Guthooks calls it a moderate climb but it was anything but. It was a steep overused and abused trail section with trash and glass used by day hikers going to Anthony's Nose. We saw several day hikers descending. One stopped us to ask about our hike and said ""the trail isn't steep is it"" as we were looking up at our climb. A passing doe stole the scene and we escaped. After cussing for a while at how steep the climb was and how late we'd make camp we finally arrived. I left River downhill a tenth of a mile getting water. I dropped my pack up at the site and doubled back to help. It sucks carrying water and your pack. We arrived back up at the site to see that Erick, Andrew and Stuff Sack were out site mates. They were super nice and welcoming as we made camp. We collected ourselves with our food bags and stoves over at a log and cooked a hasty late dinner after hanging our bear lines a little up the trail. I can eat in the dark but can't throw a bear line in it, so I wanted to make sure we wouldn't have to struggle to get our bags hung. We had great conversation with the boys who wanted to learn PCT style of bear bag hanging. So after dinner we taught them how by headlamp. They're great learners and I know they'll teach others this preferred method. It was obviously beyond hiker midnight when I crawled into my tent. I had such a fun day today with great memories.","Palisades interstate parkway visitor center mile 1395.7

I thought about stopping at the Graymoor Spiritual center for a shower but it's .4 each way and the shower is cold. I'm not feeling that desperate. It was a smooth gradual downhill from the campsite to the road and then I felt like the rest of the day was an uphill battle emotionally and physically. I have a hard time understanding why it's so much harder now to drag my butt and this pack thru NY and not be able to pull 15-18 miles a day. I'm working super hard and getting to camp late. I feel like I'm not getting anywhere and that I'm just working from sun up to sun down. I'm not practicing good self care. I haven't been getting yoga in. I'm rushing in camp to set up, eat and get to bed. I have no down time. I've been thinking and beating myself up all day not able to get my miles in. I feel like if I could do 18 a week ago I should be able to do that or better now, but I can't. I remember back in Delaware Water Gap at the bakery having coffee with Overdrive and Panther. I remember telling Overdrive I wanted to do 15 miles a day so I could walk into NH July 1. She looked at me and said not to get the miles in my head, because it's not what matters. So all day today while on this never ending climb I thought about those who quit because they are about the miles and end up hating the hike. I don't want to be that person. I can up with a new plan for me and at the end of the day on the last 2 miles I shared it with River. We hike our own hikes but we happen to jive well and are almost always on the same schedule. My plan is that I'm up at 6am and I get my morning yoga. I'm out of camp by 7:30-7:45. I break 45-60 minutes for lunch and take care of my feet massaging and rolling them. And between 4-5pm I find a campsite or a shelter and I stop hiking. It won't matter how many miles. I'm done""working"" by 5pm so I can rest, make dinner, practice self care. I shared it with River and she asked if she could join my plan too. Because she's also drained. We fist bumped and pinkie swore. Tomorrow we start our new plan. When I started out today my plan was to hike 16 miles. We got into the campsite on Dennytown Rd ( a 12 mile day) just after 7pm. Once again the 3 boys were here as well as Beatnik and Thumper ( not my friend Thumper, a trail maintainer named Thumper). River and I set up camp in section 2 and had our own picnic table. It was a sweet spot. I already felt relief knowing my new plan is in place and I wouldn't feel this way again. We had dinner and the boys came over to share with us a technique to use and existing bear line to hang another. It was cool. We'll definitely put that to use! I brushed, hung my bear bag, used the nice clean port-a-potty and crawled into my tent with a smile knowing my new plan starts now. I massaged my feet and then rolled over for a good night of sleep.","Hemlock Springs campsite mile 1406

It was a cool night last night and I slept in my fleece. I packed up inside my tent, took my stove over to the picnic table and took down both our bear bags. I cooked up my last hot breakfast, banana nut oatmeal and a hot cup of coffee. My food bag is low and I love the light weight of it. Tomorrow I'll pick up a resupply in Stormville. I set out ahead of River at 7:45 making a stop at the privy and another to dump my trash at the dumpster on Dennytown Rd. I disappeared into the woods on a level trail that wasted no time transforming to an ascending trail. I stopped at the first road crossing, which wasn't marked on Guthooks. A gravel road with no traffic. I set my pack down on a rock and made use of nature behind some rocks on the other side of the road. Returning to the rock I had a small snack and some water. No much time had passed when I saw River appear. I had pulled up a map of the state park which offers a free night of camping to thru hikers so I could find the best route and a notice came up stating that the campground was not booking for 2018 because of a new water system install. We wanted a shower. I guess that's not happening now. Though they are allowing thru hikers to camp free in a group area near the beach. We decided to stop at Canopus lake and take a swim anyway and hang out there for lunch. It was a beautiful afternoon and there was no one there. We picked a picnic table in the shade initially and stripped down to boxers and bras then walked along the warm sand to the water. I could see up the walkway towards the concession stand which is only open weekends right now and noted a couple of workers in orange vests. Once arriving at the edge of the lake River went in first and I followed, without even a pinky test. The water was cool but the sun was warm and it felt and smelled so amazing. Like my childhood swimming at Stevens pond with my sister Laura every day in the summer. I love that smell and that it evoked that memory. We swam for a few minutes getting exercise, cooling down our bodies and easing out joints before getting out. Walking back across the warm sand in the now cool feeling breeze we opted for a sunny picnic table and each layed down on a bench in the warmth of the sun. After a few minutes of sunbathing I heard a hiker coming down the trail. Still in boxers and bras we said hello and he sat at a nearby table and conversed. He happened to be a friend of someone who works for me and I have been following this guy on Instagram knowing he's friends with Clayton. Small world! He was the only other hiker that came down to the beach and if he hadn't we might not have crossed paths. Before long Twister was in his boxers and in the water. We all got to rinse out some clothes and dry them in the sun while we visited. It was great fun today and I had no pressure about miles. What a great new plan I'm on! I'm working hard, having fun and taking care of myself. After lunch River and I proceeded north and between 4 and 5 considered our options for the night. The Shenandoah campsite we passed at 5pm had a sign that said the pump was off, no water. So we agreed to hike 30 more minutes to RPH shelter for the night. We arrived at the shelter to find several people already there, 1 bunk open and a hiker sitting at a picnic table right outside the shelter opening smoking. Tenting was a better idea. So we pitched our tents but not before relaxing a few minutes on the chairs near the picnic tables. A vizsla named Achilles who is hiking with his owner took the liberty of climbing up in River's lap in the lounge chair and he layed right down on her. The 3 boys showed up as well as Twister, Oven, T-Rex, Webster and others I don't know. Lecero was hammocked nearby. Her husband will be here in 5 days and she's excited. The RPH shelter is close to the road so a pizza place and a Chinese place deliver. River and I ordered avocado salad and soda and I had broccoli and cheese soup with bacon bits from my food bag to go with it. It was nice getting to relax during and after dinner. There was quite a bit of socializing tonight and it was nice. Oven is going to be getting up at 4pm to try to get in a 35 mile day. Her tramily is way ahead and she wants to catch up. They're going to slow down to 20 mile days to help out but she'll have to pull 3 big days to catch them. I asked Oven if she thought it would be worth it and she does. Before dark I brushed and nestled into my tent for the night. I kept my food bag in my tent with me. It seemed silly to hang it since there was a big open trash can in the shelter. I don't see any bags hung and there's no box or pole.","Dennytown Rd mile 1418.3

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594433,"I slept very well last night even though we were close to the road and could hear it. I got up at 4 to use the privy and crawled back into my tent for a little more sleep. Just before 6am I did my morning yoga and stretched my feet. I could hear other hikers in their tents packing up just as I was around 6:30 and then I heard the rain start and the cuss words too. Just 10 more minutes and we would have packed up dry tents. Damn! I took down my tent from inside and under the rainfly so at least it stayed dry. I stowed it in my pack in it's stuff sack and I put the wet rainfly in the outside mesh pocket on my pack where I keep my sandals and my tent poles. It was a passing shower and gone already but the damage was done. I joined many of the other hikers at the picnic tables and had a cold breakfast. Achilles came out and scored some peanut butter from a hiker who was tired of carrying a heavy jar of it and was eager to share. I set out at 7:45 with River very shortly behind me. Today I need to stop at the post office (PO) in Stormville NY to get my resupply. The PO is 1.7 miles west of the trail on route 52. There's a deli east of the trail .4 and we'll meet there, charge our phones and get a ride to the PO. River caught up with me before the road to the deli. Her right knee has been a little ""bitchy"" as she calls it. Yesterday she called her physical therapist and got some advice. Today it's causing her some sharp pains in the knee cap. Not consistently but it's bothersome. We walked to the deli together and put our packs down near the picnic table out back for hikers. I filled my water bottles from the spicket there and we plugged our nearly dead electronics into the outlet. The deli is hiker friendly and provide these amenities as do several other businesses close to the AT. We are often made aware thru Guthooks or AWOL guide. River went inside first and grabbed some hot food from today's selection and a cold drink. While she was gone Webster arrived upset that neither the deli or the pizza place had a bathroom. He was quite upset. It made me wonder how he hiked from GA to NY and if he was carrying a virgin trowel. When River returned to the table with her loot I went inside and grabbed mashed potatoes and sausage with peppers and onions as well as a Snapple raspberry iced tea. Almost as soon as I arrived at the picnic table it began to rain again. We adorned ourselves in raingear and River rigged up her trekking umbrella over the area of the outlet so we could continue charging. We ate in our raingear at the picnic table and thought nothing of it. Life on the trail. Eventually the rain stopped and we took care of our trash I went inside to see about a taxi to the post office. The younger of the cashiers was helping me with phone books when Lilly, the other cashier, asked me where I needed to go and I told her the post office. She said if I could wait until 2pm she'd drop us off. While we waited the 45 minutes for Lilly we decided we should call this day a nero and get a room. We could do laundry, shower and rest River's knee. River made the calls and got us a room in nearby New Hope. From the PO after I collected my resupply box and the clerk helped me rescue a stranded box I bounced back in NJ we Ubered over to our motel and checked in. The room was 2nd floor, huge and newly renovated. It had a dinette table, microwave and fridge. I sorted out my resupply almost crying at how much food there was and the weight. Gosh I dreaded carrying all this! It's 5 days of food and I only wanted 3. I let River do a little shopping in my extras. She was appreciative as always. We showered and I dried my rainfly in the back parking lot.Once all that was done and River iced her knee we walked almost next door to Plated and had a great dinner while trying to get a shuttle driver to slack pack us tomorrow. We could hike and it would be easier on River's knee plus I've been struggling with low energy since last Friday. I feel like I'm hauling a team of oxen up these mountains! I'm dreading the weight of my food bag! We have no shame when trying to get a shuttle and I asked our server Travis if he's working tomorrow. He is, at 4pm but he knows another server who is off and might do it. Unfortunately Matt never responded to the texts. We finished dinner by sharing a tortupa and went across the street to the convenience store. We've decided we'll share the 7 oz package of chicken that was in my resupply box at lunch but we'll need mayo. I scored 4 mayo packets and River bought a coffee. Back in our room and still desperate for a slack pack I called a number for Julio's taxi that I got from some notes in Guthooks under Pawling NY. It's 10:30 and English is Julio's 2nd language but I get it worked out for 8:30am. Whew! It's late so I brushed my teeth and crawled into bed. River is still up but that won't bother me.","RPH Shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594563,"I slept so well last night. Very refreshing! I don't know what time River went to bed but I do remember opening my eyes at one point and seeing her on her bed with her phone. I showered and threw my hair up wet. I really wanted to shave but my $1 razor I've been carrying around is a piece of crap and I can't get the head to stay on so I gave up and tossed it. I went to the lobby and got a bucket of ice and we iced our water bladders. I packed up my backpack with what I needed for the day and put the rest in my pack liner and carried it all downstairs. Julio was waiting outside when I arrived there at 8:25. I left the key at the front desk and proceeded outside. I put everything in the back of the van and hopped in the back seat waiting for River to arrive which she did shortly. Once squared away Julio drove us to the deli we were at yesterday because River left her z-seat there. Let me just say that River does tend to lose things. Ear buds, bandanas, and at one time I looked in the trunk of an Uber after she'd grabbed her pack and her satellite tracker was there! I tease her about needing a Sherpa. She was lucky today and her z-seat was still there. She grabbed it and said hello to a group of hikers in the parking lot and hopped back into the van. Julio drove us back towards the trail but passed it and we ended up on the side of the road walking uphill to the trailhead. I love slack packing. I've been feeling pretty depleted and I thought today would make me feel a little stronger. The trail was nice with a small open field and several small ups and downs. With a light pack and nice terrain it was a day that I could focus on my thoughts. I love days like this. We stopped at the Morgan Stewart shelter for a snack. The songs in my head today were ""I feel good"" by James Brown and ""looking out my back door"" by CCR. I had mentioned to Brian that I'd love something for music for the days it might boost me and he texted the links to play both of those. So while at the shelter with 3 other hikers we enjoyed a little CCR. Such a happy toon! We found the perfect spot for lunch  later on next to a stream and I rolled out my Tyvek on a mossy area beside it and laid down. If felt super! After a short rest I filtered fresh water and we made chicken salad in a Ziploc bag to share. I ate mine with some flat bread crackers and it was excellent. We chatted with a couple of hikers that came through. One man out hiking with his son has been hiking sections of 100 miles with his son for 20 years. They have 2 more years to go and they will be done with the entire trail. They must have made some fabulous memories! I love their story. We hiked near each other all day today which isn't usually how we hike. We go at our own pace and sometimes don't see each other all day, but when we slack pack we're sharing a ride so we do tend to hike closer together. We saw a fabulous oak tree which was a perfect climbing tree and it brought back memories of climbing in the Willow tree at the park up the street from my childhood home. It would have been fun to climb this one but my appreciation for it wouldn't allow me to. We passed by Nuclear Lake which also has some history. Beautiful lake and swimming area but the name is really unappealing and we didn't swim. I didn't feel hot enough to want to. At the end of the day we called Julio when we were about 1.5 miles out from West Dover Rd so he'd be there to pick us up. When we arrived at the road we saw an even more fabulous oak tree and Brian texted me a photo of it from the guidebook he uses to follow me. The tree is over 300 years old and just amazing to hug ( as I did). The stories it could tell! Julio arrived right on time at 5:50 and dropped us off at Edward R Murrow Memorial Park. The town of Pawling allows thru hikers to camp there  1 night. It's a beautiful park with a small pond, picnic tables, covered pavilion with electric, restrooms and outdoor shower and it's been welcoming thru hikers for over 40 years. It was an honor to stay here. We set up camp under the maples near the pavilion. No other hikers we're there and that was okay, we adjusted to it. I guess many hikers stay at Toni's deli but the train tracks are right there and we prefer quiet. We made dinner and it was very cool and breezy out so we skipped the shower and cleaned up in the bathroom after dinner. I charged my phone and journaled before going to bed. The bullfrogs on the pond sure do sing off key, but it was a beautiful sound.","NY route 52 mile 1424.1 Stormville
",Edward R Murrow Memorial Park,"Jun 14, Thu",12.40
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594566,"I was conscious of the singing bullfrogs all night but not bothered. I did think about Duck Dynasty and how they like to eat them and thought about how I tried to catch them when I was a kid staying with some distant family in Turners Falls Mass in the summer. I don't know who would run around that pond with me trying to be stealth enough to catch the frogs but I like the memories of childhood innocence I'm getting. I feel like we worked for hours on those frogs. We got a late start this morning, River slept a little late. When we were packed up we called for a taxi back to the Dover oak tree where we left off the day before. 2.4 miles later I was passing through a marsh area and gorgeous boardwalk where I stopped to talk with Hugh and Molly. Molly, being 4 legged didn't have much to say but did offer her head for a petting. Hugh thruhiked in 1979 and still looks at the experience fondly. He enjoys the boardwalk with Molly on a regular basis and he showed me some wild mint that I could use as aromatherapy. It's nice to be taking time for these moments now instead of a passing hello. People have so much to offer.I then passed by the Appalachian Trail train station and took a moment to photo before meeting a southbound hiker talking about hot dogs. I got the scoop on that and went to the nursery at the street where he directed me. I was alone there except for someone working in the outside sales area. I went onto the front porch and noticed some information on the Harlem Valley Appalachian Trail Community and some instructions for hikers. I found the gazebo the notice directed me to and rid myself of 35#. I checked my shoes to be sure they were clean and went inside. In the front of the store I found hiker snacks, fuel cans, patches and in the far corner a table and bench with passport stamp, register and other great stuff including a hiker box. Turns out for $5 you can shower here and there is a refrigerator out back you can go to and pick out ice cream and cold beverages for purchase. I picked up a blackberry iced tea and a Klondike bar, a patch and a little turtle I call hitchhiker, cashed out and went to the gazebo to wait for River who I texted to stop here. Stuff Sack and Trowel ( formerly Andrew) showed up along with River. At 11am the food truck Roseanne's showed up down the street slightly and she hooked me up with a homemade chili with extra cheddar cheese. I'm trying to get more calories because that is my issue with the butt dragging. I'm not getting enough calories for immediate needs and for glycogen storage in my muscles. It was delicious. I sat a while digesting before moving on. A few miles later I came to the CT border and stopped for pictures and a Marco Polo for Brian before I was challenged by 10 mile hill. I'm not a fan of the end of day climb but it's sometimes necessary and this time totally worth it. I wandered into 10 mile river campsite after a quick tour of the shelter and privy nearby and I was so excited to be here. It was just after 5pm and I'd texted River to let her know. She wasn't far behind. We had beautiful accommodations for the 2nd night in a row! We set up and bathed in the river before cooking dinner. I just love not being sticky and salty when I crawl into my tent. Just one couple was there in their tent when I arrived. After dinner around 8-8:30 Rainbow arrived and then Grizzly and Turtle Mom. We talked to Rainbow for a few minutes after she set up. She's from Canada but lives in the UK now. I hope we see more of her. She just started out and today was her 1st day. Her tent is really different looking and I've never seen another one like it. The shelters and campsites are all close to a road here in CT. They all have bear boxes and the privy is larger and has open sides from the shoulder up. I like them. Better than the small, dark smelly variety we've seen so far. The gorgeous sound of the river is going to lull me to sleep tonight. I can't wait!","Edward R Murrow Memorial Park

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594713,"I woke up with the river and the birds. What a great alarm clock. I went down to the river for water and noted several fishermen on the opposite shore both left and right of me and wondered if there was anyone there last night watching me bathe. Hmm. 
I had a Mountain House breakfast skillet for breakfast but I don't like them much and  after forcing quite a bit down I packed out the rest. I just couldn't do it.I left camp just ahead of River and crossed the Ned Anderson memorial footbridge over the 10 mile river and stopped a minute. What a beautiful place and a beautiful day. The first 1.2 miles was such a pleasant hike. When we arrived at Bull Bridge Rd we decided to walk off trail a little to see Bulls Bridge and get a coffee. Just before the bridge we met Walter from the AMC setting up at a trail head along the Housatonic River. We chatted for a few and he held our packs while we went thru the covered bridge and to the store. Bulls Bridge Country Store is charming and very hiker friendly. We were offered charging for phones, port-a-potty and water bottle filling. We didn't have our packs so we didn't need much. But we sat outside and ate a pint of ice cream each and had coffee. At 10am. We signed the store's hiker register and made our way back to Walter and our packs and we sat down with him a few minutes to talk about what he's doing at the trail head. This particular area was really abused by mostly local traffic using the trail and swimming hole. Mounds of trash had been removed and the area restored by AMC volunteers who maintain these trail sections including the Appalachian Trail. On the weekends in the summer they set up post here to deter further abuse and educate hikers. We talked about the shelters and campsites we would be encountering and said goodbye to Walter making our way north to a long rocky climb over exposed rocky ledges. We met Jay, a ridge runner up at the first view. While we were taking our break talking with him Dozer and Napper showed up, fresh off their first visit to NYC. They left ahead of us and we set out for additional climbing and difficult terrain. Today's trail section goes by an Indian reservation and up thru a section called Indian Rocks which is known to be a mecca for rattle snakes. Ugh. I'm pretty much all adrenalined out on the rattle snakes! Thankfully I saw none today. But the seemingly endless climbing was tough. It was about 7 miles of difficulty.
We reached Mt Algo shelter just after 5 pm. There was a section hiker named James at the picnic table and a couple of tents set up in the tenting area but no one else around. They'd gone into Kent which is fairly close for a resupply. We set up in a nice flat area near a couple of sitting logs. The shelter and campsites were quite nice and there were a few of them. We set up and I went down to the brook in front of the shelter where I washed up and filtered water. Then River took a turn. When we were both done we joined James at the picnic table for dinner. While we were eating Armor arrived with his resupply and kindly shared fresh baby carrots and grapes with us. It was awesome and they were cold too! Everything out here gets warm. Even the cool water we filter for drinking is warm shortly after and while it still does the job of hydrating it's not the same refreshment. We visited for a while and then I brushed and stowed my bear bag in the bear box. I could hear the others at the picnic table a while and a father/son duo arrived back from Kent with their resupply also. Sometime later I heard River ask if I was still awake, and I was. She'd gone to the privy and discovered that a Robin had built a nest inside the privy on a shelf next to the toilet and 4 babies were sound asleep. She went back with her phone and took pictures and showed me. They were adorable little guys! It's very comfortable here with the sound of the brook and the open feeling of the site itself. I'm looking forward to a great sleep!","10 Mile River campsite

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594749,"I woke up at 12:20 to the sound of someone setting up camp near me and occasional flash of a headlamp towards my tent. I wondered who would hike so late and why. When I got up at 6 after yoga River was standing outside looking at the tent wondering when it arrived because she didn't hear it. I took the path out to the privy excited to see the baby birds this morning and there they were. I sat down next to them and they didn't move a feather. I took a couple of pictures as they watched me, completely silent. Nature is funny sometimes but I have to say these birds know they're safe. I've not met a hiker out here that would touch or disrespect them in any way. But being able to observe them so closely is amazing. On the way back down the privy path I saw River talking with someone over by the midnight tenter. And then I promptly tripped on something in the path and went face down with a huge thud. How is it I can climb mile after mile of mountain with 35# on my back without falling but I can't walk the privy path. River and the midnight tenter both turned and asked if I was okay, and I was. We all had a great laugh. It was actually pretty funny. Turns out Bags had arrived back in Pawling at 4pm from the NYC train after an excursion there. She's meeting friends up the trail and her best option was to night hike from Pawling here, thus her late arrival. I had breakfast, cleaned up, packed up and was out of camp around 7:30 after sending Brian a happy father's day text with the picture of the baby birds. From the shelter I hiked .3 to cross Schaghticoke Rd scoring an apple for trail magic at the road and began climbing. I'm guessing the 1st climb was Skiff Mt but it wasn't marked in my guide. When I reached Caleb's peak I took a rock seat and sent a picture of the sign and view to Michelle and Caleb. Then I called my Dad to wish him a happy father's day. It's always great to talk to him and he never fails to make me laugh. He said my Mom reads him my journal posts, like a bedtime story and that when I get to Mass he'll bring me beer and ice cream, since he hears I'm now fond of those. He loves the journal and would like to meet the ""cast of characters"" which had me rolling! He's charmed by the people I meet out here and the ones I'm lucky enough to spend time with. I do hope he gets to meet some! After chats with fellow hikers including a father and young boy out for the weekend River and I descended St John's ledges much to the disapproval of our knees. These are extremely steep stone steps and boulders down to the Housatonic River. The weather was really hot and humid and even descending offered up a good sweat. When we finally got down we were greeted by a really pleasant riverside walk for about 4 miles on River road which was closed to traffic and a wide dirt road. There was a small Beach area along the way and we stopped there wondering if we could swim. We were trying to look it up with the poor signal we had when we saw a family arrive across on the other shore. The children jumped in the river. So we took off some clothes and sat on rocks in boxers and shirts allowing the water to cool us off from the waste down. Somewhat refreshed but feeling drained, we headed off on some more level walking trail and stopped at Stewart Hollow Brook shelter, rested and cooked a hot lunch because we were feeling so depleted. This would just about empty my food bag. Grizzly, Turtle Mom and Culligan were there eating and resting. It's hot out! After leaving there we hiked more along the river and thru 2 fields before the 1 mile ascent to Silver Hill campsite. I always hate a good climb at the end of the day! At the campsite we found a section hiker on the wooden swing enjoying the view. Greg chatted with us for a few and then offered us a Heineken. He'd carried up a 12 pack. Of course we had one! No sense in the poor guy carrying them down full tomorrow! Grizzly and Turtle Mom arrived shortly after. They swam in the river an hour hoping to hike further today but the heat is too much and they made camp here, enjoying a beer also. When the beer was gone and River and I had eaten the dregs from our food bags the Trailer Park Boys arrived. They cowboy camped on the deck over by the swing. It was a pretty full campsite tonight with nice amenities including potable water from a hand pump, covered picnic pavilion, the deck and swing. The heat makes me more tired so I'm in my tent with my food bag stowed in the bear box by 8. Tomorrow we'll hike .8 down and walk a mile to to the town of Cornwall Bridge CT. We've rented a place for the night tomorrow and we'll take the day off so we aren't hiking in 90° heat.","Mt Algo shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594787,"I got up late at almost 7 and the campsite was empty except for myself and River and Heineken who was packed up and almost ready. He hiked out down to town via a short cut to the road. I left before 8:30 and River was in front of me today but waited for me at the road crossing. We walked along the shoulder on the side of Route 4 with cars whizzing by for almost a mile and stopped at the gas station/convenience store for a cold beverage and sat down on the curb to enjoy. A couple of people stopped to talk to us briefly. When we were done we walked a little further and stopped at the outfitters where I picked up a new bottle of bug spray. Then we crossed the street to the Cornwell Bridge Country Market and ordered breakfast. I had a sandwich with 2 eggs, ham, cheddar cheese and avocado. It was delicious! I drank 3 Snapple raspberry iced tea. Rainbow arrived and joined us on the porch. She was finishing some work on her laptop and was expecting a package at the post office after noon. The temps quickly soared today and more hikers appeared. Most were day and section hikers. We chatted with 2 women day hikers who were fun to talk to and had lots of questions about thru hiking. We had rented an apartment for the night at Amselhaus nearby. After we were done eating and socializing we decided we'd head over there and shower, throw our laundry in and come back over for lunch and resupply. Of course we'd have to stop at the package store also, sign the register and collect a free beer. We did all of that after meeting with Robin at Amselhaus to check in. What a very nice person and a very special house with wonderful history. This was truly a relaxing space that we could just sink into, unlike a hotel room. Being Monday we planned to watch the bacheloret tonight and drink our beer. We wandered back to the store freshly showered and hungry again to find Rainbow still on the porch. We extended an invitation to the 3rd bedroom in the apartment and we went inside in the AC to order lunch and eat. We met Full Throttle and No Name inside where they were trying to cool down. Full Throttle was over heated and sick, having trouble drinking. Not a good thing. He was hoping to go back out and hike 6 more miles to a shelter. After eating lunch I did some resupply shopping for dinner and 2 full days on trail. It's very expensive to resupply at these small stores. I dread it because it's almost double what I'd spend at a grocery store. Just before I wandered back to the apartment Rainbow caught me to take us up on the 3rd bedroom. Too hot and unsafe to hike long distance=full house. Back at the apartment it was cool downstairs and tolerable upstairs for a while but we did have to call Robin and ask for the air conditioners that hadn't been installed yet. She tried to bring them up but it was too much for her so we all went outside and grabbed one and brought them to our bedrooms where Robin held up the window sashes as we installed them. And the cooling began! Whew! A thunderstorm rolled thru and Rainbow watched it from the front porch. It did little to cool things off outside. Since we couldn't get any ABC channel to come in on the satellite dish River downloaded the ABC app and we ate our dinner, ice cream and drank our beer while watching last week's episode on her phone which was propped up on the coffee table. After that I retreated to my nice cool bedroom for slumber! It's been a great restful day.","Silver Hill campsite

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594831,"I slept well getting up a little after 1am to use the bathroom which was downstairs and was surprised to find River on the sofa still up. When I returned to my bedroom I was surprised how cool it was in there  but it felt good. I'm not one for a lot of AC especially in the bedroom so it was quite different from my normal. I got up at 5am and showered then packed what I wanted for the day in my bag and put the rest in my bag liner and set it aside in the living room. Robin is slack packing us today. I ate the rest of my ice cream pint from yesterday. I know that sounds shameful and it's hard for me to believe but I truly need the calories. I filled and iced my water bladder and was out the door.  I arrived at the store shortly after they opened at 6am and had an egg sandwich like yesterday and an orange juice. River arrived and told me she'd done a final check of the house and found my town skirt and top in the laundry room and put them in the bag in the living room. I was really grateful as I hate wearing my rain gear while my hiking clothes are being washed. Rainbow came in and grabbed something from the store and was off before 6:30. I left  the porch of the store at 7am and took the 1 mile road walk back to the trail. My morning Climb awaited. I passed a sweet campsite which I haven't seen much of in CT. Camping is allowed only in designated areas and it appears well respected. I hadn't seen a hiker yet this morning and the peace of being alone out here was very nice. I came to the top of a hill to hear a deer off to my left snorting  I looked and stopped not saying a word as the deer posed for me. We watched each other for a few minutes with curiosity. She never ran off and I eventually walked past. Today is breezy and humid with a certain peacefulness in the forest. I'll take it!  I continued climbing 7 miles breaking for a snack about 4 miles in where Twigs, Foghorn and his dog Achilles stopped for a few.  I had lunch on Easter Mt. where River joined me and the rest was nice. I'm feeling so much stronger and I was surprised to see I'd already hiked 7.2 miles climbing and it was around noon. After an hour break we enjoyed the pine Forest. I love the smell of the pine forest and the feeling of the trail under my feet. We met up with No Name, Full Throttle and another of their friends and they followed us to Falls Village on this awesome section of rolling luxurious trail to town making our first stop short of town at a repair station with a soda vending machine outside. The thunderstorm had knocked out the machine last night but the owner fetched us some slightly cool cans of coke that he'd recently removed from the machine and put in the fridge inside. We drank them in the shade and left the cans in the crate next to the machine.   It was 4:30 when we arrived in town and I stopped at the hydro plant where I took a cold outdoor shower by the road in my boxers and bra with Full Throttle and No Name on the lawn and cars passing by. It's nice to have this shower as well as power outlet and trash can they provide. The shower got all the salt and stickiness off me even without soap and I threw my shirt and skirt back on over my wet underclothes and walked to the Toymaker's cafe where River was waiting for Robin to drop off my gear. River said she was suddenly not feeling well. No one was at the cafe or upstairs and we can't stay here without permission. While we were waiting for Robin the cafe owners arrived and were happy to accommodate us by the barn. A power outlet, picnic table and grill, chairs, trash and hose were all provided.  Robin arrived shortly after with our gear and we squared away with her and got set up. The 3 guys arrived by car, which they'd left in town and they set up on the side of the barn.  
River still wasn't feeling well and had a cup of broth while I ate dinner. After dinner she came to the Inn with me and we sat at the bar. I had a local lager and ice water and the bartender was kind enough to fill my liter bottle because the water from the hose at the cafe tasted like the plastic hose and was not drinkable to me. River had a cup of tea. Just before leaving I went to the ladies room and heard an urgent knock on the door....River was exclaiming she was going to vomit. I opened the door and she did just that the poor thing. Several times. I stayed for most of it trying to confort her. When she was done we sat on the front porch for a few to be sure she felt well enough to walk back to the cafe. I felt very badly for her. No one wants to be sick out here. It's harder without the comfort of loved ones and home. We crawled into our tents and I journaled before falling asleep.","Cornwall Bridge CT

I knew right then I wasn't going to leave this morning because there was no way she could and I wasn't going to hike out if she wasn't able to keep food and liquid down. What a bummer because it's a gorgeous hiking day! 
Greg, the owner of the cafe came down and opened the door so we could use the restroom and he made breakfast sandwiches which the guys bought. The Cafe wasn't open for business, but Greg did this for hikers. I hope those reading this understand the kindness and generosity these people offer to hikers and what it means to us. It would be far different without these wonderful people. Truly a blessing to cross paths with them. I explained to Greg that River was ill and I wasn't sure what time we'd be able to leave. He told me we could stay as long as we needed and he meant it. He suggested coconut water to rehydrate River who could not even get out of her tent after the 4am vomit. I got her 1 and then later 2 more. All morning she rested. I ate oatmeal from my bag at the picnic table and then crawled into my tent for an hour nap. Shortly after 11am River got up and was able to sit in a chair. I went to the package store and got her an orange Gatorade and she made an oatmeal package which she kept down. Greg came out with packages of oyster crackers for her and encouraged her to stay as long as needed, even another night. Once I was sure she was mending I told her I would be hiking out the 3.3 miles between 3 and 4 pm today. It makes no sense to hike further because I need to get my resupply box in Salisbury and there are no other shelters or campsites before there other than the one I'm heading to which is Limestone Springs. I wanted to skip it because it's a steep half mile side trail in and out but it's all I've got available to me. I left at 2:45 so I could use the restroom at the Town Hall which closed at 3pm and get a liter of water. I stopped at the package store and got a Dunkin donuts mocha beverage and a lemon lime Gatorade and said goodbye to Rachel the dog who sleeps in a bed on the counter there all day. She's cute as a button and loves people. I had a pleasant walk down Water St past the shower from yesterday but no one was there. I hadn't really looked at the guide book so everything after that was a beautiful surprise. I crossed an iron bridge and saw a riverside picnic area where I believe tenting is also allowed and then the trail lead back into the woods where I heard the rushing water of the falls and spent some time there on side trails admiring it. I love it! It's really beautiful here this Falls Village. These are lucky people! I had a beautiful climb up prospect mountain and stopped at the top to take some pictures using my self timer on my phone. Aside from a woman at the falls with her dog I haven't seen anyone out on the trail. I made the steep side trail and camp by 5pm and set up on a platform after seeing a text from River that she was heading my way but she'd be resting as needed. I had dinner (rice noodles with chicken broth and a side of peanut butter, 2 Tate's chocolate chip cookies) with Goldilocks and a father daughter duo all out on section hikes. While I was cleaning up and getting water at the spring River arrived. To save energy she'd be staying in the shelter. She was heading up there when I stowed my bear bag in the bear box and headed off to my tent. I'm stoked to be on a level platform tonight. No sliding and no rocks or sticks under me. There's a chance of rain but I'm hoping to pack out a dry tent in the morning!","Toymaker's cafe Falls Village CT mile 1492.3

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595252,"I woke up with a dry tent after a not so great sleep. I think my sleeping pad was too firm and I couldn't get comfortable. After I let some air out I had a better couple of hours of sleep. I cooked my breakfast up at the picnic table by River and the shelter after I had packed up my tent and gear. I had no water left so I filled a liter from the spring and left at 7:30 for the steep climb up and off this half mile blue blaze trail. No how I wanted to start my day but it made sense to stay here last night knowing that I needed to stop in Salisbury CT for my resupply package at the post office. I've been looking forward to Rands view which is only 1/10th of a mile north. Local hikers Sandy and Jason told me about it when I saw them a few days ago and Brian mentioned it also, from notes in the guide he uses. I could see the clearing just before I reached the edge of the woodline but it looked like an ordinary farm field until I got there. It was still before 8am and when I stepped out from the woods I stood and soaked it in. It was beautiful and bucolic. Freshly bailed hay and rolling pasture with a mountain backdrop complete with the morning mist still hanging in the valley. I took a few pictures and soaked in a little more before I headed north. It was a pretty easy 4 miles to town plus a road walk of a half mile or so. 
Salisbury is adorable. I love the quaint village setting with well maintained local shops and eateries. It feels like an affluent town. I found pharmacy first and bought a Snapple raspberry iced tea and set my pack down next to a bench outside. The post office was next door and I was helped by a very nice clerk and received my package. I opened it and began to sort it after digging my food bag out of my pack. As usual there was too much. Brian had done a great job doubling up my dinners and adding extra oats and brown sugar to my breakfast. I need the larger servings and calories. When I was packing up my stuff Goldie Locks and River arrived and headed to the post office for their packages. River and I eventually took our stuff to the courtyard out back where I enjoyed an ice cream and an iced coffee while we visited with Fixed Gear and Olive Branch and charged our phones. I left first knowing that I had to climb Lion's Head and Bear Mountain before getting to the CT/Mass line and Sages Ravine campsite. And climbs they were. My food bag was HEAVY and I was sweating like crazy. On the backside of Bear Mountain the descent was tough and some was butt sliding by necessity. Today was also summer solstice which happens to be naked hiking day. I opted out, thank you. And I am happy to report I didn't see anyone opting in. However I do know that there were participants and they include River who hiked Lion's Head in the buff. She doesn't recommended it however due to pack chaffing. I wanted to do a Marco Polo and send a picture of the sign to my sister Catie when I got to Mass but there was none. I got to the campsite, climbed up to site #1 and texted River to let her know about the Bear Mountain descent. Then I set up and hiked back down to the water to bathe and filter drinking water. I washed my socks and underwear too and dropped a sock down by the water which meant that later I had to go back down and up again. Exhausting! I was sitting on a log boiling water for my dinner when River arrived. Then I brushed and took the long trip to the bear box, further up in the campsite of course! I drifted off to sleep while River ate her dinner at the log by the foot of my tent. It's quiet here. One other man and Goldie Locks and they're camped out back. I look forward to my first full day in Mass tomorrow. CT has been beautiful!","Limestone Springs Campsite

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595334,"It was a nice night of sleep. Super quiet here and the only disturbance was the mouse trying to climb the outside of my tent just before I dozed off. I'd seen him on a log near my tent last night while I was eating. The mice here on the trail seem bold to me. I made oatmeal for breakfast and packed up. I said goodbye to River at 6:15 after hanging my still wet laundry on my pack to dry as I hiked and headed down the hill to the trail. Goldie Locks had left before me and was just leaving the stream when I arrived to filter water before crossing it on the log footbridge. I'm excited to be in Mass.It's carving out to look like a 14 mile day with 3 mountain climbs. Mt Race, Mt Everett and Mt Bushnell. But as I walked thru Sages Ravine I could only focus on that. It reminds me so much of the Whites. The sound, view and smell. I completely enjoyed the small waterfalls and eventually crossed over and up away from the stream. Today water will be scarce as many small streams and springs have dried up. But the sobo section hiker in camp last night said that there will be plenty of trail magic water as the issue is well known. I climbed Mt Race and enjoyed the views for a few minutes before heading up trail to Mt Everett which was more challenging. It was a steeper longer climb to the top of this 2602' summit. I was getting nervous about how much water I'd had to drink since the ravine. The descent took me a while and it was a workout for the knees. I just about finished my water and I had one more mountain to summit. I passed by the blue blaze trails to Hemlock and Glen Brook shelters, committing myself to the 14 miles and all 3 peaks. As I hiked I happened to see near my feet 2 slivers of wood perfectly positioned as a cross. They were smaller than toothpicks but reminded me that God is with me out here. I found it comforting. I crossed a dirt road and headed back into the woods for another tenth of a mile where I knew I'd emerge at a parking area with picnic table and port-a-potty. I saw the picnic table first. On each end sat a giant thermos of ice cold water. Chained to each thermos were a dozen additional gallons of water. Instant relief! There was a couple at the table and they waived me over as soon as they saw me. Trail angels Jimmy and I Believe ( she thru hiked in 2014 and he has a YouTube channel and interviews thru hikers). They had fresh fruit, chips, macadamia nuts, soda and all kinds of goodies. I sat and enjoyed some cherries, a kind bar, some macadamia nuts and of course a root beer. I had such great conversation with them and other hikers that sat down. Fogg and Goldie Locks enjoyed a respite too. I waited for River but left before she arrived after filling my water bottle and giving an interview for Jimmy's channel. These trail angels are from TN and are here helping hikers. Their kindness brought me to tears before I departed. I put Jimmy's number in my phone so I can call them when I'm down south. I tackled the last of the peaks and then the terrain was finally kind to me. I popped out of the woods at a road crossing and saw Jimmy and I Believe in their truck. They jumped out, took my pack and set out a chair for me handing me a cold bottle of water. I drank it down and grabbed my essentials bag and slack packed another 1.7 miles with Goldie Locks when she arrived. At Route 7 I thought I'd grab my pack and hitch to the community center 5 miles away but instead Jimmy gave us a ride while I Believe waited at the road for another hiker. I got checked in and paid $7 to use the facilities. It was 5:45 and they close at 8:30. I gave River a text update and then made my way to the women's locker room for a hot shower. I hung out in the lounge area for a while snacking out of my bag, drinking a Snapple raspberry iced tea from the vending machine and charging my phone. I was walking across the field looking for the tenting area when River arrived. She thumbed a ride in time to have a 45 minute window to use the facilities and shower. I set up my tent on a somewhat level tent pad in the woods then cooked my dinner under the pavilion in the field where River and Goldie Locks joined me. There was a wild bunny nearby, just adorable! The sun set behind the community center building and it was quite a nice evening. I ducked back inside the woods and River and I hung our food bags on a cable that was strung for a ropes course. I tucked myself in and realized I'm on a little slope but it will have to do. It's already dark in the woods.","Sage's Ravine campsite

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595247,"I slept pretty well last night on the almost level platform. My head was a little low so I got a little stuffy until I put my fleece under my pillow for more elevation. I went back to sleep until 5:50. Surprisingly I seem to be sleeping past the birds at 4ish which is nice. I dressed and went for a walk to see if I could locate the port-a-potty I think I saw last night on the way in. I found it way at the back of the second parking lot near a dumpster. It was cleaned on the 21st and still pristine. A sight to behold! 
I walked back through the lots and across the grass up the blue blaze trail to my tent platform and began to break down camp. When I was all packed up I brushed my teeth and headed to the picnic tables in the field. River soon joined me and we ate our breakfast. Jimmy came by to see how the tenting was as he and I Believe are likely going to stay here tonight. He reminded me that McDonald's is close by. When he left I told River I was going to walk there for coffee and a hash brown. She wished that she hadn't just eaten her oatmeal. So we met at McDonald's and each charged our phones and fueled up. Jimmy and I Believe were there and after giving River some oatmeal packets and a couple of other things they drove us to the trail. They are super kind people. I can't say enough positive words about them and what they do. I look forward to seeing them again when I'm in the south. As usual this morning was a climb. A few hikers passed us and River gave her extra breakfast burrito that she packed out of McDonald's to a thru hiker nobo from GA. He was happy! At the top of the climb we sat on the ledges snacking and looking at the mountains we climbed yesterday. Race, Everett, Bushnell and Jug End. It was a WOW moment looking at them. Showtime and Sour Patch arrived for a snack also. They stayed at the community center and were slack packing today. We all left together and they said they'd be stopping at the next shelter for lunch as the proceeded ahead. We climbed again for what seemed like forever even though the shelter was 2.6 miles from the ledges. Finally I stopped to check on Guthooks to see if we'd passed the blue blaze trail without seeing it but we were still 3/10th of a mile from it. We were looking forward to a 45 minute max stop for lunch and then to push on 5 more miles to the next shelter. As we arrived at Tom Leonard shelter I saw Showtime and Sour Patch at the picnic table with their food spread out and I asked if they'd brought me a grinder for lunch. He replied with "" I brought you something better"" and then from behind him out of the shelter I saw my husband! I'm pretty sure I screamed and suddenly at once I saw my Mom and Dad and my sister in-law Pek Wan and her husband Danny. I cried and laughed and hugged and kissed my family even though I was all sweaty. River introduced herself and got hugs too. I was so surprised, especially that they all walked over a mile of trail plus a blue blaze trail to surprise me at a shelter. It felt almost dream like for a few minutes. It gave them a look at a section of my life and they met other hikers. Actually Brian gave Showtime and Sour Patch a ride to the trail from the McDonald's that River and I were at this morning and they knew all about the surprise and kept it a secret. He also met Jimmy and I Believe who confirmed they'd dropped us off at the trail earlier. We hiked out with my family and said goodbye to my Mom and Dad after scoring some root beer and Gatorade from them and they headed home. They knew just what to bring me! Brian, Pek Wan and Danny took our packs and went to get a couple of hotel rooms while slacking us 2 more miles. We got picked up after our short slack pack and shuttled back to the hotel for showers before dinner and a great visit at the Barrington Brewery. After dinner Pek Wan did our laundry for us and Brian had to drive back home to take care of our diabetic cat and keep his appointments for tomorrow. It was late and I retired to the room and crawled into bed. I closed my eyes and replayed my day which started as any other day has out here but is now my best and favorite hiking day EVER. Thank you to my wonderful husband for his great surprise and my Mom and Dad and Pek Wan and Danny for all their love and support and for driving and hiking to surprise me and make my day!","Route 7 mile 1520.6

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595564,"I slept like a baby! I woke up around 6am and saw my clean laundry folded on the desk at the end of my bed. I showered, packed and enjoyed some fresh fruit River was kind enough to bring me from the breakfast room. We're planning to have breakfast with Pek Wan and Danny at Rio where we can have corned beef hash and home fries. We met them in the lobby at 8am and Pek Wan had brought the car around. She's so thoughtful!
We navigated to the restaurant and the meal was delicious. Freshly squeezed orange juice, eggs, hash and potatoes. Yummy! After fueling up Pek Wan drove us to Carr's hardware store so River could get a can of fuel for her stove. They only had the Coleman ones, which are finiky so Pek Wan is going to pick up 2 canisters and bring them next Saturday. She, Danny and their niece Lauren are coming to slack pack us, do a little hiking of their own and possibly provide some trail magic. I'm excited to see them again and enjoy a town dinner Saturday night. I'm extremely food driven at this point!They dropped us off at the trail head where we got picked up yesterday and Danny gave us some chews made by Cliff bar. I'm looking forward to trying them. River and I split the lemon lime Gatorade from my Mom and Dad and brought the fruit punch one to give to another hiker. As we were getting our gear on Goldilocks popped out of the trail at the road. I called her over and she took the Gatorade and a Luna bar Pek Wan offered and was greatful. We said goodbye and River and I began the climb we had seen was waiting for us yesterday. Within 15 minutes the sweat began pouring off me and I reached for my nice clean bandana to wipe my face so it wouldn't sting my eyes. My bandana has never smelled so wonderful! I don't know if Pek Wan used fabric softener or what it was but all day long, even drenched with sweat it smelled great. It made me think about the love of my family and more about yesterday and how my Mom even gave up her backpack to Sour Patch when we were at the shelter because the one she'd purchased to slack pack with had torn. I'm still in awe and so happy to have seen and hugged and kissed them all. River and I planned for a short 4 miles today based on yesterday's forecast. But when we saw the radar this morning it looked like the thunderstorms may be north of us. We hiked to the Mt Wilcox north shelter where we agreed the night before we'd stay. But the weather was holding out and we felt good so we took a break and decided to hike 4 more miles to the Shaker campsite. With less than a mile to go, it did start to rain but only lightly. We made it to the campsite and just as we were getting ready to set up our tents it started to rain heavily. We set up and dove in so that we could get out of our wet clothes. I set up in the back, and River set up on one of the platforms next to the picnic table and privy. Once I was inside my tent I changed into my pajamas which were nice and dry and then it stopped raining, so I sent her a text message to let her know I was going to be putting on my rain gear and heading over to the picnic table to cook dinner and use the privy. It was just before 5pm. She agreed that was a good plan. While I was getting my shoes on I heard some commotion which sounded like celebration. I wondered what hiker had come into the campsite that was cause for celebration. But when I stepped out of my tent and headed over towards the picnic table I realized the commotion was to scare away a mother bear and her two cubs, so I dashed back to my tent, dove in and grabbed the whistle off my backpack. When I returned to the area where River and Goldilocks were, I blew my whistle but mama bear just wasn't leaving. She was very close to the camp and she was next to the bear,  moving in between the bear box and the picnic table area. Apparently Goldilocks had been cooking her dinner at the picnic table and heard a slight rustling in the bushes behind her. When she turned around she saw the mother bear and 2 first year cubs. Mother bear had her nose in the air obviously delighted with Goldilocks culinary skills. She grabbed the pot that she was cooking her dinner in and went over to Rivers tent where River was putting on dry clothes and explained to River that there were three bears in Camp and she didn't know what to do. River instantly said make noise and started whistling so that's what the initial commotion was. I summoned the other two hikers who were setting up their tents off to the side ( Aligator and Eddyman) they heard the celebration but didn't know what it was either, so I asked them to come and help us scare away the bears. No matter how much noise we all made the bears were not really fazed. It only sufficed to keep mama bear from coming all the way to the picnic table. After 30 minutes or so we were exhausted, and when we stopped making noise mama bear would come right down the trail towards the picnic table again. Eventually we took all of our food bags and we retreated to the back of the tent site, and stood there quietly hoping that the baby bears would come out of the tree they had hiked up into and Mama would take them and leave. But no such thing happened, Mama stayed and the baby bears stayed in the tree. We were able to shoo Mama bear down the trail enough so that we could pack up our tents and grab the things off the picnic table that had been left there, and we exited through the back side of the campsite bushwhacking our way back to the trail. River called a shuttle driver who picked us up an hour later on the nearest road 2 miles north on the trail. Just as we spilled out onto the road a calf came crawling under the fence from the cow pasture on the opposite side of the road and right into the road just as we saw a minivan headed toward it. River jumped out into the street to stop the vehicle and shoo the baby cow back under the fence. Ironically the minivan was our shuttle driver Debbie. She drove us into Lee where we got rooms at the Super 8 Motel, followed by an 8:30 dinner at Friendly's across the street. The only one who had eaten dinner was Goldilocks. It was 10pm when we got back to our rooms. Debbie will pick us up at 8:30 tomorrow and bring us back to the trail where we exited tonight. What a day! A planned 4 miles turned into an adrenaline rush and a 10.1 mile day. But I got ice cream!","Blue Hill Rd mile 1530.2

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595567,"After yesterday it was nice to be able to sleep in a little. River was kind enough to bring me coffee from the lobby and I had some oatmeal in the room, Bob's Red Mill which is my favorite, and I added a package of VT maple syrup to it. When I was packed up and ready I went to the lobby to wait with everyone for Debbie. I scored a banana and ate it right down so I could dispose of the peel and grabbed a hot cocoa package for later. When Debbie arrived we piled into her van and she brought us right back to Jerusalem Rd and the cow pasture. Today that calf was laying down like it's never been mischievous! We walked thru the cow pasture right along side the cows minding where we stepped of course. Today would be a short 8 miles to Upper Goose Pond Cabin. 
I'm looking forward to staying at the cabin and it's great we'll all get there early. We've made friends with Aligator and Eddyman and Goldilocks and we'll all be staying there. The cabin has bunks with mattresses, caretakers that cook pancakes in the morning and even a beach and canoes. Not your typical shelter! The property was gifted to the ATC in 1982 by a hunting club and is operated by the ATC and the state I believe. It's a special place. After the cow pasture we climbed Baldy Mt and the trail was decent after that. We passed knee deep pond which I didn't check for accuracy and eventually came out onto Goose Pond Rd. I was chatting with Highlander who is from Scotland and hiking a section headed south. I was letting her know about the bears at the next campsite. A pickup truck pulled up along side with 2 ridge runners. Perfect! I reported the incident with them and the man told me that the bear is in the area every year for the past 10 but has never been reported as having come into camp which is aggressive. He seemed to think she's desperate having 2 cubs to feed this year. Maybe so. He reported it to his superior and was going to check out the site, make sure there's no trash in the bear box and post the site. The rest of the group had made it to the road now and we sat in the sun and had lunch. I made mocha. Yum! After lunch we hiked the rest of the way to the pond including the.5 blue blaze trail. We received orientation from Debbie and her daughter Maarit. They've been volunteering a week a year since Maarit was 8. She's probably late 30's now. Apparently it's a coveted position to volunteer for one of the 25 weeks the shelter is open each year. We got bunks and enjoyed swimming and canoeing before dinner. River and I paddled out around a small island and back. The pond is beautiful! The cabin and tent sites all filled up with around 20 hikers. There's a nice wash station there for brushing your teeth and some other nice features. By 9pm we were all in bed with visions of pancakes and freshly brewed coffee dancing in our heads! A nice day and different from the normal grind of the trail. I hiked 8 miles but I feel well rested.","Jerusalem Rd mile 1540.1

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595632,"A few more hikers showed up last night at the cabin and I was surprised to see The Lorax. I haven't seen him since near Unionville when he was still hiking in basketball sneakers. He took 10 days off and went home to surprise his brother for his high school graduation. His parents were surprised too. And while home a pair of size 18 Columbia hiking boots arrived. He did 21 miles in comfort yesterday, his 1st day back on trail. I won't see him again. He left just after 5am today and needs to get to Maine before school starts. Going for his PhD in chemical engineering. 
We're going to hike 17.6 miles today because the elevation is really flat and we can then summit Greylock on Thursday instead of Friday so we can be in VT Friday. We left just after breakfast which was served at 6:30. I had oatmeal and coffee but the caretakers made pancakes which were certainly a hit. As we'd hoped the terrain was awesome. No big climbs or descents. We stopped for lunch at a shelter and then at the ""Cookie Lady's"" house where Eddyman and Alligator had a supply box. We met Marilyn the cookie lady and she was so sweet. She came out to great us with a basket of homemade cookies. I bought a Klondike bar and lemonade and 2 hard boiled eggs. Everything was delicious. I filled up my water at the spigot she provides and met her very social cat Dolly. Before we left Showtime and Sour Patch arrived. They are hiking into Dalton today, a 20+ mile day. We just had a few miles left to Kay Woods shelter. We took a short break on the top of Warner Hill also, our only real view today. But we're happy to trade the views for the easy terrain today. We reached the shelter around 5:30. A few other hikers had steamed ahead of us and taken some of the tent spots and there were 2 hikers in the shelter. The shelter was tempting with the loft and 2 upper bunks open but I set up my tent in a somewhat sloping spot near the rest of our group. I just like the privacy of my tent. I walked down to the stream and got water for dinner and took a seat at the picnic table. Moose and Sweat Tea were there along with a couple of guys from the Trailer Park Boys and they made room for the 4 of us as we arrived. I was really hungry and it was difficult to wait for my dinner to fully hydrate so it was a little chewy. After dinner I returned to the stream for more water to wash up and fill my water bladder for tomorrow morning. I brushed and organized my food bag before putting it in the bear box. It's a bit cooler tonight and I'll sleep with my fleece on. It was a mellow day today and I'm tired from the miles.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596031,"I slept well getting up once to pee and then going back to sleep. We had a quick cold breakfast this morning knowing that it was a 3 mile hike to Dalton and eggs and bacon. I'm excited to have a huge breakfast and be well fueled. All 4 of us left camp at 7:30. A short 3 miles later we crossed a set of railroad tracks coming into Dalton and a nice trail head board with a color coded map of area businesses was there for us and really helpful. As we walked thru a residential area of Dalton we noticed several AT stickers and related signs on the homes and it was immediately welcoming. The guy who picked River up the day we stayed at the community center in Great Barrington told her there was a guy named Tom who owns a white house on the street and he welcomes hikers to tent in his yard. We saw the tents and met Tom, even got a stamp for our passports. Highlander was there and I thought that odd since she was hiking south when I met her. But she was dropped there last night by one of the ridge runners I met who is picking her up and bringing her to Boston today. Very kind!
We continued on thru Dalton and off trail .5 mile which seemed like forever to the Dalton restaurant. I remember thinking it had better be worth it because street walking hurts my feet.  We took the corner booth called ""pig pen"" which resembled how disgusting we felt. I had a meat lovers omelet with home fries and a side of bacon. It was strange to even hear myself order it, but I ate all but the bacon which I packed out for later. We got our water filled, phones charged and some nice pictures of us. On the way back to the trail we stopped at a sub shop/juice and Java place and packed out lunch! A win win. The trail walks thru the residential area and back into the woods. I met up with River, Alligator and Eddyman for lunch on some logs and we all enjoyed our fresh sandwiches and some foot rest. I don't recall how but somehow I ended up passing alligator and Eddyman later and getting into Cheshire before everyone. It could have been because I saw in the guide there would be an ice cream place we'd walk by but I'll never admit to that. The forcast was for showers after 3pm and they we're right on time.  I reached Diane's Twist after spilling out of the woods and taking yet another painful asphalt walk thru a residential area and turning onto High St towards St Mary of the Assumption Church. I ordered a medium twist in a dish with strawberries and seated myself at a picnic table outside under a maple tree. I was half done when Alligator and Eddyman saw me and joined in. River followed before we were done and enjoyed an ice cream too. We met Snowplow there who we watched hobble in. He's having serious foot issues and just got new Merrill Moab shoes today. I hope it helps. He's also headed to the church for the night and to zero tomorrow. A rail trail bike path runs past the ice cream shop and a couple out cycling stopped to talk with us. After ice cream we walked to St Mary's Assumption church about a block and a half away. We read the posted notice for hikers on the door, and entered the hall. The lights were off and there was no one there. Eddieman thought it would be a good idea  to set up our tents along the side of the building close to the building so that at least we could block the weather from one side. Because the roof is flat, we wouldn't get any additional rain flow from that. So we went outside and set up our tents in the drizzle, which meant that I set up my rainfly first and my tent underneath it to stay dry. I staked out my rain fly and vestibules, but I didn't quite have enough room so there was a little slack in both sides. I'm missing a couple of tent stakes, I just never had them with me, so I use sticks to stake out the ends of the rain fly where my head and foot are to pull it away from my tent and make sure that I shed water well. I'd like to stay dry, and the weather is supposed to be pretty nasty tonight. Right after we had our tents up we went inside and use the facilities and hung out in the classroom that's available inside the hall charging our phones and organizing our backpacks. I still had half of my sandwich from lunch, so I ate that and some snacks for dinner and I didn't have to cook. Other hikers started to arrive, and set up their tents along the side of the building in line with ours. Before long the entire side of the building was filled with tents and hikers enjoying each other's company inside the hall. Some ordered Chinese food, others used the picnic table outside to cook their dinner and enjoy it inside away from the rain. The facilities were extremely nice and the church is extremely generous. The bathrooms were well-maintained and very clean  and because of the weather the gentleman who was supposed to lock the doors at 7 pm Left them open for us until 10 pm and agreed to come in the morning to open them at 5: 30 so that we would have access to the restrooms and the hall all day if we were taking a zero or at least so that we would have the access before we headed out for the day. Very thoughtful and kind.Wee had been told earlier in the day that there was a Dunkin Donuts inside the Shell station not far from the church. Because I needed a resupply I needed to go in that direction, and Eddy man loves coffee so he River and I all walked together to the Shell station. Eddieman bought us all a coffee while I did my resupply and then we sat together at a small table and enjoyed the warm beverages until the last drop. When we returned to the church, I got ready for bed and a little after 8 I was in my tent. It was already raining, and I laid there until 10 updating my journal. of course, right after the doors were locked my bladder decided it was full. I convinced myself to go to sleep anyway, but I woke up a few hours later and had to utilize a gallon ziplock bag. It was absolutely pouring rain most of the night and there was no way that I was going to run out there and pee on the church lawn. I hope the weather breaks in the morning, because we're going to be hiking up Greylock, and I'd rather not hike through trail streams.","Kay Woods shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596038,"I woke up at 5:30 after hearing the pouring rain all night. I grabbed my quilt from the right side of me and noticed my hand was wet. So I moved the quilt quickly and realized some water had been seeping into my tent on the right side because I wasn't able to stretch my rain fly and vestibule out all the way on that side. Though it wasn't much I just didn't want my quilt to get wet so I packed everything up inside my tent, and went inside the hall to use the restroom and brush my teeth. When I came back out and went into the classroom, Eddieman man was there and he realized that the rain had almost stopped and this would be a really good time to take down the tent quickly. So we did just that. And I used a bandana to dry up the water on my tent floor and packed it away with my rain fly, because the bottom underneath was wet. I boiled some water outside on the picnic table and had an oatmeal that alligator and Eddy man head given me. It was absolutely delicious with strawberries and nuts in it. we are getting slack packed today by Debbie, the shuttle driver who rescued us from the Bears a couple of days ago. While I was getting my pack ready she pulled up, almost an hour early but waited. I put my tent my clothes my cooking kit and all the other things that I would not need today inside the plastic bag liner of my backpack And put it in the back of Debbie's van. In my backpack I kept only the essentials that I would need today, and I filled my water bladder with fresh tap water so that I wouldn't need to filter water along the way.  We paid Debbie which was more than a reasonable rate, and I gave her a little extra thinking that it was too inexpensive for her time and she drove away. 
a few minutes later we left the church and Debbie called Rivers cell phone, stating that she had the wrong address for Bascom Lodge where she is supposed to drop off our gear. She thought she was only going 5 miles, when in reality to get to the lodge is a 30 minute drive. So we walked to the post office and she met us there to collect the additional fee, which we were all more than happy to pay. It means a lot to be able to slack pack especially on a day such as today, and most shuttle drivers are reasonable with their rates, Debbie included of course. once that was squared away, we headed out in pouring rain to conquer Mount Greylock. we have reservations to stay in the bunk room at the lodge, and for dinner. We're estimating that we will make it by 2pm and check in is at 3pm. We are all really looking forward to the lodge!As I hoped it wouldn't, it poured and poured and the trail today was a small stream flowing at me as I was ascending Mount Greylock. It really never stopped, and my rain gear soaked through to my clothing, and my feet felt like little prunes. We stopped at Mark Noble shelter for lunch, and Eddyman had packed out instant Starbucks coffee and his jetboil this morning, so that he could make coffee for us at lunch time and we could all at least have that enjoyment on this dreary day. while he was making us coffee, I took off my boots and dumped the water on the shelter floor, and wrung out all four of my socks. I tried to let my feet dry out a little before having to put my wet socks and wet shoes back on. While we were enjoying our coffee sitting on the bunks, a couple of children strolled over to the picnic table from the trail, and then another, and then I realized who they might be and I asked if they were the Crawford Family. The children answered yes, and shortly thereafter the rest of the six children and the parents arrived and seated at the picnic table for their lunch and break. We had a little small talk and enjoy each other's company while they had their lunch, they let us play Paparazzi and take a couple of photos, and then we left the shelter ahead of them.Shortly after resuming our hike North, the Crawford Family passed us. It was awesome to hear the children singing and giggling and talking ahead of us on the trail for a really long time, even in areas where they were out of our site. Clearly they are enjoying their Journey at least on this rainy day.When we reached the summit of Greylock, it was no longer pouring, but very foggy and drizzly and gray. We took a few moments to peer through the fog at the war memorial which marks the summit, but I did not go inside. I was hoping to reserve a trip inside the memorial for tomorrow morning when hopefully the clouds and Rain would clear and I would be able to see the gorgeous views up here. After a few photos and a look at the beautiful raised map of the mountain range, we entered the lodge.The clerk who checked us in went to high school with Eddieman. It's a small world indeed! she was very kind, and told us that we could use the hooks on the enclosed porch where Debbie had dropped our gear earlier in the day to hang up our tents and wet items to dry. So we did just that, to dry out our tent rain flies rain gear at cetera. The fireplace was going in the lodge so we took off our boots and dried them in front of that. We checked into the bunk room and a Gentleman showed us around upstairs. We immediately returned downstairs to grab our gear and went back up and claimed our bunks, the coveted bottom bunks! Right after that we were all taking a hot shower and trying to wash some of our clothes, either in the shower or in the bathroom sinks. I was feeling relaxed yet a little sleepy so I went upstairs to my bunk and laid down for a few minutes. I journaled but couldn't update anything because even though there's Wi-Fi here it is very poor and intermittent. I wondered downstairs at 6: 45 to find the area with the fireplace pretty full of guests enjoying an evening glass of wine or beer. I located Phillip, and scored myself a glass of Cabernet. When the dining room opened for the 7 seating River Eddieman Alligator and myself were seated at one table. they enjoyed freshly baked bread with butter, and I enjoyed just the butter. I know that sounds strange but it tasted really good and I needed the fat. I had another glass of wine with my pork chop which was accompanied by fresh mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus and was absolutely delicious, as were the waldorf salad and sorbet. The company was great. I really love these people and I feel so blessed to have met them all!I went upstairs after dinner, sleepy from the wine, brushed and flossed and retired to my bunk for the night. I was dozing in and out as the other bunk room occupants retired one by one.","St Mary's Assumption church Cheshire mile 1577.5

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596055,"I woke up wondering if it was time to get up. I turned on my cell phone that I had stashed under my pillow and noticed it was only 2:30 so I convinced my mind and my body to go back to sleep until 6am. I got up and took my toothbrush and hiking clothes into the ladies room to get dressed. From the ladies room window I can see we're still pretty socked in with clouds but it's not raining. My clothes are mostly dry except my socks and liners so I have to hike in my clean socks from my bag and no liners and hope I don't get blisters. I'll do my best to keep my feet dry but the trail is likely going to be very wet still today. After getting dressed I went back to the bunk room and grabbed my pack and things and went downstairs to the covered porch where my tent is. I said good morning to Phillip who was headed home after working last night and serving me the wine.  
I packed up my tent and the rest of the stuff I was drying and packed my backpack. My shoes had dried by the fireplace and that made me really happy. Eddyman and Alligator had breakfast from their food bags but River and I were waiting for the dining room to open at 8:00 for breakfast. I have one oatmeal left in my bag but I need more than that. Eddyman and Alligator left before 8am and River and I were first in line to order breakfast at 8:00. I had 3 eggs with bacon, sausage and home fries. I packed out my bacon and River caught sight of that and did the same. We hit the trail at 8:27am. Unfortunately the war memorial was not open until 9:30 so I didn't get to go up to see the views. Most of the clouds had burned off and there were large pockets of views. I took a walk around the outside and took pictures of the information plaques outside with photos of the mountains I'd climbed. Wow. Sometimes I can't believe it myself. I've actually climbed those I thought, and I'll climb many more. And I'm not afraid to. As I suspected the trail was wet and water was still flowing down it. I went slowly to be sure not to fall. I'm already sporting several butt bruises from recent falls and I'm trying to be more careful. The initial descent wasn't too bad but the trail was up and down all day and it seemed like a long 13 miles. I'll cross the border today into VT and I'm looking forward to it. This will be the 8th state. I'm not finished with WV yet, that will be completed in my 2nd half but I've hiked thru some of it. On my way up a climb 2 day hikers passed going south and then 2 more came south and asked me if I was a thruhiker. When I responded with the correct answer of yes I was rewarded with a soda. A cool can of Coke. Thank you very much! Endless and Qbee have both hiked the trail and were out spreading trail magic while enjoying a day hike. I was instructed where the cooler was stashed so I could drop my empty can in it when done. I made it up to the top of Mt Williams where I treated myself to the rest of the sweet soda and then began another descent. I came down across the road and disposed of my empty can in the cooler inside the woods as directed. The descent continued and eventually I popped out in Williamstown at a sign with ""trail magic"" posted posted by the city councilor. A short distance away I can drop my pack and pick up a free bicycle for use around town to enjoy the local business community and get chores done. I don't have the time to spend in town today but what a wonderful thing to do. As I hooked a right for my beloved asphalt walk thru town I saw 2 hikers ahead. Alligator and Eddyman! I hollered ""hey"" and they turned around and took a curb seat under a maple tree for shade and waited for me. It's hot this afternoon, so much cooler in the woods, but we enjoyed a snack and some electrolytes before proceeding. The trail thru town doesn't pass any businesses which is why the bikes are a wonderful idea. We crossed a pedestrian bridge and ogled an above ground pool as we passed it. That would be amazing right now we all agreed.  Eventually the trail took a left up a shared driveway and we arrived at a garden hose and a sign ""Thru hikers help yourself"". And we did. We filled our bottles, I wet my bandana and Eddyman wet his neck. The hose was buried so the water wasn't hot. The owner came out and let us know we could change the setting on the nozzle to ""shower"" and shower if we wanted. We passed on that and hiked into the woods after expressing our gratitude. We followed a beautiful wide brook with nice bathing pools for a while. And when we could no longer pass it up we each found our own pool to enjoy. I dropped my skirt and sat right down in mine. I took off my shirt and rinsed it well trying to get some of the stink out and then put it on wet to help me stay cool. I pulled my skirt back on, redressed my feet and took off after Eddyman and Alligator with a freshly wet bandana and a cool feeling. A little breeze made it feel like air conditioning. One more climb up to Eph's view. By the way, when you see the "" bad weather trail"" option just before the climb you know it's going to be a bitch. And it was. But it was the last one of the day. I met up with Alligator and Eddyman again at the VT border and waited until they left so I could send a video message to Brian. I love bringing him along with me when I cross to a new state. As I was recording River arrived but I didn't stop. Service was spotty so I don't know if he'll get the video right away or if it will send later. I'm officially in state #8 for me. The 3 miles from the border to the Seth Warner shelter was a breeze. A few miles from camp I heard a gunshot... close. I stopped and thought for a second and continued on and heard another, and then more. I kept moving. 5 minutes later I came across the sign that read ""gunshots may be heard from nearby firing range"". I smiled and said to myself ""would have been nice to have seen that 5 minutes ago, like before I stopped to consider wether or not I was being shot at"".  I strolled into camp with River to see Alligator and Eddyman setting up and a few other hikers there already set up and resting. I found a spot and put my tent together before checking out the shelter. It was almost 6pm and I was feeling like I just wanted to eat and get to bed. But when I wandered around to the shelter with my food bag and met Betsy and her dog Sam I already felt better. Sam's a cutie and this was their first overnight together. Betsy is hiking the long trail and the other couple here is hiking the first division of it. All nice people. It was discovered by one of them that the bear box was padlocked closed so we'd have to hang bags tonight. One more chore. Eddyman found a great limb by the shelter and tossed River's line over which we used to hoist the others. I gave Betsy a carabinier because she'd need one to hang PCT style and Eddyman and River taught her how to do it. Because I snacked on pepperoni and cheese while boiling my water I couldn't eat all of my turkey and sweet potato stew so I shared it with River and she didn't have to have eggs for dinner. It worked out perfectly. Right after dinner I brushed, hung my bear bag and hit my pillow. I thought I'd sleep early and well.... and then I heard the ATVs. And I heard them close and loud until after 1am. This must be a cruel joke. I can't see the ATVs but it sounds like they're right in camp.","Mt Greylock

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596073,"After I went to bed last night Moose and Sweet Tea, Showtime and Sour Patch and 2 other hikers arrived at camp and set up. I was up at 6am and on the way back from the privy  later when I saw Showtime and Sour Patch by the shelter. It was probably around 7:30 and Sour Patch was limping around a bit with her camp sandals on. She explained that she'd twisted her ankle yesterday and Showtime had taped it up. It was feeling ""better"" but she didn't look convincing to me.  A bit bleary-eyed from interrupted sleep and a tough day yesterday we all left camp a little after 8am and headed 3/10ths of a mile to County Rd. The plan was  to meet Pak Wan there at 8:30 to slack pack us. She and her niece Lauren were very excited to help us out today and take a little hike of their own. We were alI looking forward to it too. Today is Alligator's 9th day on trail and it's been almost 2 weeks since River and I had a day off. I had no service in camp last night but out at the road my text messages came through just as Pek Wan was calling River. She'd been in town an hour trying to get to the meeting point but a section of the dirt road isn't passable without a truck. We can see the road near us is improved recently and that a tractor trailer has brought in heavy equipment for the power lines and it's sitting there. There's also a Toyota Highlander parked at the trail. But without street maps we can't help her find a way in from the other side so we breathe a sigh of disappointment and hike on with our packs after discussing dinner plans at the end of our day at Route 9, 5 miles east of Bennington. As I'm hiking it seems like a long day that just drags on with lots of mud as well as ups and downs. The mud is boot sucking deep mud puddles that I'm not walking thru but around. It's taking extra time and patience and it's everywhere not just a few spots. It's extremely humid and the sweat is pouring off my head. I can feel it dripping down my scalp. At one point Moose passed me and let me know that River was behind because she was on the phone with Pek Wan confirming where we're going to end our hike today at Route 9. I stopped at a brook and doused myself and my shirt to cool down. At lunchtime, I thought it was strange I didn't see Alligator and Eddyman. I generally catch up to them and we lunch together. At the shelter 7 miles in I did run across Moose and Sweet Tea sleeping on the bunks, each face down. A noontime nap. The heat really does zap the energy right out of you. I assumed that Alligator and Eddyman didn't want to disturb them and moved on to look for a spot ahead and so I proceeded on, not wanting to disturb them either. I didn't see anyone and it was a long time before I found a suitable lunch spot with a dry place to sit and without a swarm of bugs and deer flies. At the base of Harmon Hill I found a nice Camp spot where I spread out my tyvek and enjoyed a lunch of tuna salad, pepperoni, Fritos and propel. I had to laugh at the little mint that came in the tuna salad kit. My breath was the least of my ""stink"" concerns. While relaxing I received a text message from Alligator that she had gone off trail by accident and they were now behind me instead of in front. Before I finished up my lunch they arrived at the campsite. River was about a mile back. I also got a text from Pek Wan saying that she'd  just gotten back from dropping Jessica and Frank in town. I didn't know what that meant but assumed she'd given some hikers a ride.  Alligator and Eddyman left ahead of me to conquer the last of today's climbs. I began the ascent unhappy to see the steep rocky trail but knowing I have to power through it. In preparation I'd chewed one of the blocks that Danny gave me last weekend for endurance. When I reached the top of Harmon Hill I saw a moose running toward me southbound, and he explained that he had left his cellphone back at the shelter while he napped, that it had fallen out of his pocket in the bunk. I called River and she was one and a half miles north of the shelter but she agreed to drop her pack and run back for his phone and save him the extra mileage. Moose had already run up the other side of Harmon Hill because he and sweet tea we're almost in Bennington when he realized it. That was really super kind of river to help out. It added 3.2 miles to her day. I hiked ahead leaving Alligator, Eddyman and Moose at the top of the hill. Pek Wan had texted me and let me know she had cold beer and soda in the parking lot at Route 9. I certainly didn't want that to get warm! I grabbed Sweat Tea along the way and let River know so she could tell Moose, who's pack we left on the side of the trail for him. Moose carried his pack and River's to repay her for running back for his phone!When we got down to the parking lot after a steep stone stair descent that crushes knees the story of today started to fill in. Sometimes we make plans and then God laughs and shows you the real plan. Back at County Rd at 8:30 this morning River stayed behind to use the ladies room (AKA the nearest tree) when the rest of us left. She spoke with Pek Wan again to confirm where we would finish hiking today. When River started hiking she forgot her trekking poles at the road. She hiked back to get them and saw Showtime and Sour Patch there. Sour Patch was unable to hike because of her ankle. She couldn't handle the weight of her pack on it.  Pek Wan with the aid of River was able to connect with Showtime who's name I now know is Frank. Frank was able to pull up maps and Pek Wan drove to neighboring Stamford and under direction of Frank after a few attempts was able to navigate back roads and make it to the exact spot where we would have met this morning for a slack pack where she picked up Frank and Jessica (Sour Patch) and bring them to town. A trail angel!Sweet Tea and I enjoyed a visit with Pek Wan and Lauren as well as chocolate, chips, beer and soda. Maple Tree, Alligator, Eddyman, Moose, River and another couple from the shelter last night stopped by and enjoyed the break also. Pek Wan ran Sweet Tea into town to the grocery store and McDonald's while I bathed in the river and got ready for dinner. Lauren and I then took the leftover snacks across the street to a hiker box in the woods. Lauren was impressed with the care and friendship we hikers have developed and aspires to hike the Appalachian Trail some day too. We met Eddyman and Alligator at Madison Brew Co for dinner. Tonight is the last night we'll see them. They're hiking on and River and I are taking a few days off trail. I want to be home for my anniversary and Brian's birthday. So River is coming with me to NH so we can get her to the airport to go home for a few days too. We'll be back on the 6th. I hope we get to see Eddyman and Alligator in the future even if not on the trail. Very special people and I have enjoyed every minute of our time together. We hugged goodbye and Pek Wan drove them to their hotel while River and I got ice cream. Pek Wan then drove us to Keene NH ( where I was born!) And Brian met us at the square. It was an interesting day and although it didn't turn out as we planned it did turn out exactly as it was supposed to be. Once again I'm reminded of the love of both family and friends and the devotion to each other. It's special out here. I already can't wait to get back, but I'm looking forward to seeing my wonderful husband and a few days of rest.","Seth Warner shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596615,"It was really nice to be at home for a few days of rest and relaxation. I enjoyed every moment I got to spend with Brian, just being together and also celebrating our anniversary and his birthday. I made it to all the appointments that we'd scheduled before including a deep tissue massage. The owner of Serendipity Spa treated me to it because she feels I'm an inspiration to her and others. I didn't think of myself that way but I understand it more now that I think about how other hikers have inspired me. I also got to visit with a few friends and family members and I enjoyed seeing Kyle and Lisa and their new place. I even got to have breakfast with Valerie who I'd been hoping to see. A bonus was running into some good friends who were dining at the same restaurant where we celebrated Brian's birthday. And I got to spend some time with my friend Pam and see what her new space is going to be looking like when it's ready. I'm especially excited for her. I bought an mp3 player, and her son was kind enough to outfit it with music for me. I never thought I'd be someone who'd hike  the Appalachian Trail with ear buds in but being home reminded me of some of the things I take for granted. I hadn't heard much music for 2 months. Hearing it made me dance in the kitchen and remember how happy it makes me. It only seems right that I can enjoy some on the trail too, especially when it's a tough day. we were up at 6: 30 a.m. and ready to leave just before 8. The first stop was Dunkin Donuts and the second stop was to drop our cat off at the vet. Once that was done we were on our way to Bennington. When we arrived at the parking lot where Pek Wan had picked us up on Saturday Thumper and my sister in law Becky and husband Dave were waiting. Thumper had gotten a ride from Dalton by a friend and skipped up the trail to hike with us. Becky was there to hike a bit with us, and Dave planned to spend some time at the trailhead parking lot with Brian providing trail magic to other hikers. Becky hiked 1. 4 miles with us to the first shelter. It was all up hill and she was such a trooper. We had a snack and some water at the shelter and when we departed she headed south toward the parking lot and we continued North. She sent me a picture later looking both elated and relieved as she reached the foot bridge near the parking area!It was a gradual climb up Glastonbury mountain almost all day. As I got closer to Goddard shelter hikers started passing me and recognizing me as Puddles. They had received trail magic from Brian and Dave and were quite happy. Apparently the trail magic included pictures of myself, River and Thumper. I arrived at the shelter around the same time as Thumper and River to find it very crowded. We decided to get water and  hike a little further toward the tower at the top of Glastonbury mountain where we found a great little campsite perfect for 3 tents. It was windy and cold, but we climbed up to the top of the fire tower and experienced a 360 degree view and beautiful sunset. Totally worth going a little past the shelter. It was nice and quiet up here except the wind roaring through the pine trees. It was close to 8pm or so when we got there because we'd started at noon and spent some time hiking with Becky but we'd had a great 1st day back on trail and it felt good. I made spaghetti for dinner which was delicious and drank some electrolytes. When I brushed my teeth I used a small toothpaste I'd gotten from the dentist while I was home. The new hygienist gave me a couple and they're perfect, except it's bubble gum flavor. I'm stuck with it until I get to a town. I understand some parents may find it handy when teaching children good brushing habits, but I find I feel like I'm brushing my teeth with dessert. It just doesn't do it for me. After that disappointment I hung my bear bag ( complete with bubble gum toothpaste) from the fire tower and crawled into my chilly tent. I'm not kidding when I say it cold. It's very windy and in the low 40's. Brrrr! I first had to wash the mud off my legs so I used my water bottle cap to hydrate my compressed towels and washed. Then I put on the pajamas I had exchanged at home which are now some lightweight base layer leggings and a tank top. Then I put on clean socks and my fleece and pulled my quilt up over me. And I lay there shivering. It was 9:45. By 11 pm I had pulled my buff off my pillow and put it on my head and fastened up my quilt to be like a sleeping bag. It's designed that way but I don't often have to use it as such. Soon after the shivering thankfully stopped and I was warm. Except now my bladder was niggling at my conscience and I couldn't go to sleep. I had to pee. The wind was really howling steadily and I didn't want to go outside. So I looked around in my pack for a plastic gallon Ziploc bag. Having not located one that I felt confident wouldn't leave me mopping up my tent floor with my bandana, I put my camp sandals on and boogied out and behind my tent as quickly as I could getting it over with and me back into my little cocoon. To add to the so far sleepless night my right foot was cramping. Apparently it thought I was all done with my thru hike and it was choosing to protest having to work. I massaged it for a while and it finally gave in. Just for good measure I took 2 pm Advil and looked at my watch. 11:48. I hope the 6 hours I get are super restful.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596632,"I was awakened by loud talking giggling young girls at 5:35. I'm assuming they didn't see our tents and had hiked up from the shelter to see the sun rise from the fire tower. Being too cold for me to get up and watch the sunrise myself, I pulled my quilt up a little further over my face and closed my eyes. When I woke again it was 6:34  and only 41° outside. Not exactly luring me out of my cocoon! I wiggled on my clothes, leaving my sleeping leggings on underneath and my fleece on top and I packed up the contents of my tent and headed outside to retrieve my food bag from the fire tower. I had breakfast with River and Thumper, some oatmeal with coconut oil and maple syrup added for fat and calories. At 8: 38 I headed out of camp leaving Thumper and River still packing up. I hiked for the first 20 minutes with my fleece on until I stopped to remove it and put it in my pack but I left my leggings on because it was still so chilly. I hiked 4 miles to Kid Gore shelter for a snack meeting Thumper there who had hot coffee to share.  She'd passed me on the trail not far from the tower. River arrived a few minutes later. There were several other thru-hikers and section hikers there, many of whom stayed at Goddard shelter last night. This shelter has a nice little view and we spent a good deal of time enjoying it with our shoes off having a snack, hot coffee and conversation with the others. I removed my leggings and we resumed hiking for another 4.6 and met for lunch at Story Brook shelter which is conveniently right on the trail. while the terrain was mostly favorable today, the mud was not. There was so much mud everywhere and it was tiring just walking through and around it. Apparently Vermont doesn't know mud season is in April. There weren't many viewpoints today but we did pass a nice beaver pond, however there were no beavers out on display when I passed by. I did have music today, which I listened to for 7 miles. I found it to be a wonderful mood enhancer and good pace changer. I felt like I was flying through the forest on cruising speed.We had discussed camping at Kelley Strand Road, being there was a tent site not far from the parking area. But as I approached a stream Crossing with a bridge I saw Thumper there who had stopped to get water and from the bridge I could see on the other side of the stream the most beautiful campsite. I asked Thumper if she thought we should spend the night there or hike the additional mile to where we had planned to stay. We decided that we'd wait for River to join us and make a decision together. As soon as River hit the bridge and saw Thumper and I sitting at the campsite on the other side she smiled and threw up her arms and said ""it looks like home for the night"". It really was a beautiful spot. We set up camp with plenty of room, washed in the brook, gathered water, and enjoyed our dinner together. There was a campsite on the other side of the river which was later occupied by a thru hiker in a hammock named Easy Pete. It was cool but still warmer than the previous night and the daytime temps had been perfect for hiking. I brushed my teeth with the bubble gum toothpaste again and hung my bear bag. I climbed into my tent and used my water bottle cap to hydrate a compressed towel and washed the bottom of my feet so I could put some foot balm on and massage them. I'd bought a new small tin of foot balm while I was home. As I began massaging it in I realized it was peppermint scented. Hmmm. I thought about getting up and washing it off in the brook but decided I'd take a chance as bear bate and put clean socks on over it.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596999,"I slept well and it was actually a relief that I didn't wake up to a bear licking my toes. I got up at 6:15 had breakfast and packed up camp, hitting the trail at 8:15 by myself. I absolutely loved the hike up Stratton Mountain with it's winding switch backs and gradual slope. At the top I met the care takers who were chatting with some other folks by their hut. I then wandered over toward the fire tower and took a seat on a rock in the shade to have a snack and some water. Being Sunday there were lots of people and dogs up here.  I immediately thought of bear Mountain in New York, and I knew that there must be a parking area and shorter Trail in close proximity. River and thumper arrived at the summit not long after I did. I signed the log book and I was waiting to climb the fire tower because they only allow 4 people at a time, when a hiker who had gotten the trail log out of the box to sign shouted my nam after reading it in the log. It was Buddha. I have not seen Buddha since New Jersey and I was surprised to see him today. I thought he was miles in front of us. You just never know when you'll run into a hiker who you thought you'd never see again. It was good to catch up with him and when it was our turn Thumper, River and I climbed to the tower and took our photos. Stratton Mountain doesn't have a view from the summit unless you climb the fire tower. Once up there the view was absolutely amazing and 360°. We climbed down, and I left the summit ahead of Thumper and River. a while later while I was at Stratton shelter where I stopped for lunch I received text messages from thumper and River stating that they had both gone off Trail by accident but were back on Trail now and just a little delayed. Apparently they headed out the shorter Trail all the other people and dogs came in on instead of the AT North. I waited for them to arrive at the shelter but only saw Thumper. As I was leaving the shelter I noticed River's backpack outside the privy. I don't know how the girl does it but she has yet to use her trowel and here it was after 2pm. That thing is still shiny new! I Hiked on ahead as they had lunch and stopped briefly at Stratton pond where I met the shelter caretaker John and thanked him for keeping the shelter so well. There were of course some day use hikers at the beach, so I didn't swim. Besides I really wasn't feeling well. I had a massive headache swelling and some other discomfort brewing. 
I stopped at Winhill River for water, and I was sitting on a rock filling my bottles when I saw Thumper pass by up above on the trail. I shouted  to her and she stopped. I had been sitting there for a while and I had noticed a campsite across the water from me and also a single site on the trail near where she stood. I explained that I wasn't feeling well and I was trying to rest to see if I could get another mile and a half to the next stream and hopefully there would be some campsites there. But as we talked more about it it made more sense to camp there for the night given how I was feeling and not risk hiking additional miles to not find a site. I took the single tent site next to the trail for myself and River and Thumper crossed the river and set up camp at a beautiful little spot along the edge. They came across the river to my site and we all had dinner together before retiring early. Today was a very difficult day for me health wise. I'm hoping some extra rest will improve me and tomorrow will be better.","Mile 1624.3 brookside campsite

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597000,"I slept okay last night, actually better than expected after some calmness and deep relaxing breathing and enjoyed morning yoga at 5:30. I was up packing my gear at 6 and after breakfast I left camp at 7:34. The morning hike was enjoyable and I was feeling better and more energized than yesterday. I ran into 1 hiker early on named little spoon. He's headed to Bromley also. I didn't see another hiker all morning on trail.  A part of the hike was a gravel road and off it I took a very short trail out to prospect rock which was a beautiful overlook of the town of Manchester Center where we agreed we'd hitch into to resupply and do laundry. We stink and my food bag is nearly empty. I stopped at Spruce Peak shelter for a snack and the privy. As I was chatting with Packrat and his wife and admiring their dog Riley who are out for a section hike another hiker came in. I recognized him instantly. Grumpy, who I'd met on my first few days in Maryland. I didn't expect I'd see him again but a soft tissue foot injury took him off trail for 6 weeks. So he skipped up to VT and got back on in Bennington. Thumper and River arrived and Thumper had met him previously also. He too was headed into Manchester Center to pick up a resupply his wife had mailed to him. We hiked out together with a plan to share a ride and have lunch together and hike up to the top of Mt Bromley when we're done. The ski patrol leaves their warming hut open for hikers to sleep in. Odly we hiked up to the road which is generally a hike down. 9 miles hiked and at the road at noon. Good time! We crossed the busy Route 11 and went into the trail head parking lot and into the shade until we were all there. Then we moved back out to the road to thumb a ride. A first for me! Grumpy and I walked up the hill away from the lot so the number of hikers was spread out. Several cars passed us by. Grumpy gave up and dialed a number for a taxi but there was no answer and the voicemail was full. I was just getting ready to try for an Uber when a car pulled off to pick us up. Joe was very kind. He's 80 and lives in Stratton and was headed to Price Chopper which was exactly where we wanted to go. Perfect! We had nice conversation on the 5 mile trek and thanked him for stopping for us. River, Thumper and 2 other hikers were picked up by a pickup truck and rode in the back to the store. We got our food shopping done and Grumpy got his package from the post office. The laundromat was across the street so I quick changed my clothes (easy in a skirt) and gave my laundry to River who was kind enough to throw it in the wash while I got an iced coffee and some refresher packets from Starbucks which I was happy to see! We all met at the pizza place right there for lunch. We charged our electronics and enjoyed a meal and ice cream. I ran across the street and put the clothes in the dryer and after lunch River retrieved them and we dealt with sorting and folding on the patio behind the pizza place. Then it was time to get back to the trail and the 3 additional miles to the summit of Mt Bromley. We thumbed from the laundromat parking lot and the 3rd car picked up Grumpy and I. Joe and Grace who live in VT now and are hikers who backpacked in Alaska when they resided there and know what it's like to need a ride.  Super nice people who taught in Eskimo villages.We hiked up the 2 miles to Bromley shelter where we supplied with water for the night and the 7 miles we'd have to hike tomorrow before the next water source. Then we hiked up the last mile to the summit. Gorgeous view! As I hiked up the ski slope at the last section I remembered to turn around look back to drink it all in. We settled into the warming hut in a small room like a pantry because the floor spayin the main room was full. There was room for me on the floor and there was a section of shelving on the right. River is 5'1"" and she fit conveniently on the shelf. So we dubbed her elf on the shelf and she made her bed there close to the window. We had a snack and watched the sunset from a rock outcropping after I got to talk with Brian on the phone. It was quite windy but the sunset was beautiful. I brushed and visited the privy before crawling into my bed. But my body was restless and it was almost 1am before I fell asleep. The stars were gorgeous. I could see them through the window and also when I went outside to pee at 11:30. No light pollution up here. But I'd rather be sleeping.","Winhall River tent site mile mile 1642

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597385,"I woke up at 5am to the sound of birds and deflating sleeping pads. I closed my eyes and tried to just rest and then stretch finally getting up at 5:35. I was feeling very tired. I dressed and visited the privy brushing my teeth on the way back. Several hikers were already headed out including Thumper and Grumpy. I sat at the inside picnic table with River after boiling my water outside and made my oatmeal. Some hikers had slept out on the chair lift platform and came into the building to use picnic table as well. Almost everyone was gone by the time River and were packed up and ready. I headed out at 8am before River. 
The descent was not bad but it didn't stay down long before climbing Styles and Peru peaks. I stopped for lunch at Peru Peak shelter and was soon joined by River and later Epic. The brook and footbridge were right beside us sounding soothing and making filtering water a breeze. After lunch I headed off down the trail which turned into the most amazingly flat and Speedy section I have encountered yet. River and I met at Griffith Lake and took a quick swim. It was amazing! So refreshing! We headed back up the trail leaving 4 young women at the lake enjoying it. It was sunny and warm. Just as I reached the lost Pond shelter access trail I heard a rumble of thunder off to the West. I thought about stopping and Hiking into the shelter waiting for it to pass, but I could see the sky a little bit and it didn't seem that the storm was very close yet. With the trail being in the condition that it was I decided I would press on to Big Branch shelter just under 2 miles away. Before I reached Big Branch shelter I started to question my wisdom. I should know better having been caught in 2 serious storms back in Pennsylvania. But I continued to boogie down the trail eventually sort of trail running, as the wind picked up and the Thunder rolled closer. There was no serious rain yet but about two tenths of a mile before Big Branch shelter I started to encounter a few raindrops. I passed by a campsite on the left occupied by four young men who clearly had hiked in from the road as evidenced by their array of lawn chairs and awnings. I knew at this point I must be really close to Big Branch. When I saw the Footbridge I had instant relief and I knew the shelter was just one tenth of a mile away. the storm was over head now, thunder and lightning and increased rain drops but I had no rain gear on and no pack cover and there was no time to stop. The trail approached the shelter from the side and as I jumped inside skipping the steps with the sky opening up behind me I saw a young woman setting up a tent inside. At the same time I entered the shelter I said you can't set up a tent inside of the shelter. I scared this young woman half out of her mind and her hands went wild in the air as she screamed repeatedly. Once she calmed down she hugged me. I learned that this young woman, Faith, was terrified of the thunderstorm. She had set up her tent outside the shelter prior to the storm even though tenting is not allowed there. As the storm approached she hung her bear bag and decided to put her tent inside the shelter since no one else was there at 5 pm. She told me that just prior to my arrival she had asked God to please send her a person because she didn't want to be alone and had only seen one other hiker all day. And here I was scaring the wits out of her! The rain poured down in buckets followed by hail. We sat and watched it while having a snack, some water and discussed that when the storm subsided she would pack up her stuff and come and join myself and River at a tent site by the footbridge. She was quite relieved to not have to spend the night by herself.At this point River had still not arrived but the storm was over so we packed up and left the shelter headinf back the tenth of a mile to the Footbridge and just after we exited the shelter a tree broke in the forest loud and crashing scaring Faith once more and she screamed and jumped and ran behind me. I turned around and calmly told her that she was okay that she was going to be all right but she was still on edge and just half scared out of her wits. We found a beautiful large campsite right on the edge of the river with a view of the Footbridge and settled in. Once we had our tents set up River arrived and announced that she was home! I was worried about her for a while, but after setting up my tent and before her arrival I went over to the Footbridge to take a few photographs and Next Step passed by letting me know that River was safe at the Lost Pond shelter and was not sure if she was going to spend the night there or come to Big Branch. But I know River and I thought she would probably have her dinner and once the storm passed she would continue the less than 2 miles being that there was still plenty of daylight and camp where we had agreed at Big Branch. Faith and I made our dinner and ate while River set up camp. We hung our bear lines after I totally obliterated my rock sack by having it crash onto the large Boulders on the side of the river while trying to get it up and over the branch. The mesh now has gaping holes in it and I'll have to tape it with Tenacious Tape. When we were just about ready for bed a young man wandered into the site looking for space for his tent and River directed him to a nice flat area out back and private  He was quite pleased and settled in. He came over to get water and chat for a minute before turning in for the evening. His name is Pegasus, and ironically he is from Bow New Hampshire. It was kind of late so we didn't speak long before we all crawled into our tents to get some sleep. The sound of the River will lull me to sleep. I hope everyone else in camp has a restful night too.","Bromley summit

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597491,"I slept well but got up twice to pee. Just before bed last night River and I agreed on an earlier start and to get up at 5:30 leaving by 7. At 5:30 Faith came to my tent to make sure I was awake. I was already packing up, and after I had taken down my tent and packed up my bag I grabbed the bear bags and joined River and Faith over on the rocks to enjoy breakfast together. Thumper was supposed to have stayed with us at this camp but she texted us yesterday to let us know that she would be hiking  ahead and was looking at some time constraints and wanting to do consistently 15 mile or better days so I wished her well feeling like I probably will never see her again. I left camp at 7: 09 headed toward Little Rock Pond. Before long river was right behind me and we arrived at Little Rock Pond shelter and tenting area together. It was absolutely gorgeous the way the clouds were hanging in the sky reflecting on the pond. If it hadn't been early in the morning and if we had been sweaty from hiking more miles we both agreed we would totally be in the water. Seeing its beauty and thinking about all of the great campsites that I had seen over the past few days and some that I'd stayed in made me think of Brian and how much I want to share these places with him. I sent a text telling him that I look forward to spending a few days in Vermont with him next year backpacking and these are some of the places I'd like to share with him. I'm not really sure how much he likes backpacking but the elevation here is favorable and the tent sites are amazing. River and I talked about whether or not we would stop at the white rocks Cliff which was a two tenths of a mile blue-blazed Trail to an overlook. The only thing that we saw before that were a bunch of white rocks at White Rock Junction. Pretty anti-climactic. By this time I was ahead of river and I decided to pass by the blue blaze Trail because it was very steep and I just didn't know that it would be worth it so I continued down the hill toward Greenwall shelter and sat on the log at the beginning of the blue blaze Trail to it and had my lunch. An avocado with tuna salad and potato sticks. I received a text message from River and she had taken the trip out to the Overlook. There were lots of tourists about today hiking to and from this overlook. River joined me on the log for lunch before I had finished and regretted hiking down to the Overlook.I left our lunch log ahead of river and started the descent down toward the falls. I ran across a beautiful family of about 12 with children ranging in age from 2 to 18 who were absolutely fascinated by my backpack and my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. They were wonderful to talk to and very curious children with lots of really great questions. I completely enjoyed our conversation which lasted for at least 20 minutes or so. When I left them I continued straight by mistake on a blue-blazed trail which led four tenths of a mile down to a parking lot never realizing that the AT took a right hand turn. It was my first time mistakenly going off Trail. It was a steep and rocky descent, which made it a steep and rocky ascent in order for me to get back to the AT. I was disappointed with myself and with the extra effort this added to my day. I sent a text to let River know that I was no longer in front of her but 40 minutes behind her.River waited for me at the Minerva Hinchey shelter where we had a snack and some water before finishing up the last 3 miles together. There were a bunch of hikers at the shelter, I didn't meet them all but I did meet Jackie who was waiting for her boyfriend to hike in with their dog, some new shoes and a grinder for her and she was very excited to be seeing him. She's thru-hiking the Long Trail.River and I descended some slippery and smooth rocks covered with pine needles just before Clarendon Gorge suspension bridge and crossed the bridge getting a nice view of the gorge and Mill River. On the other side of the bridge we ran into a group of four. The gentleman and his wife were thru-hikers in 2003 and moved from Alabama to Vermont sometime after. They were going for a short stroll with their grandson and his girlfriend, and presently they are Trail maintainers and provide shuttles and sometimes overnight stays to hikers. He was explaining that the Rocks we came down were the scene of many recent accidents which included broken ankles and wrists. It was very nice to meet them and have a short conversation before we finished our hike at Route 103.We crossed the street from the parking lot and hitched a ride into Rutland to The Yellow Deli. It only took a minute for Tom to pull over and pick us up. We had some good conversation on the way to town and he dropped us off right in front of the deli. We walked into the deli to register and the hostel manager Aysh welcomed us with  refreshing glasses of peach matte iced tea. It was absolutely delicious! He showed us to the hostel and gave us a tour. Thumper was there and looked surprised to see us. We were surprised to see her. The women's bunk room was nearly full  with only one bunk available and it was an upper bunk. Having noted that Aysh brought us to the third floor and the Overflow bunk room with 4 beds. River and I took the two lower bunks. We were confirmed for 2 nights. The Yellow Deli is amazing and I couldn't rave enough about this hostel. It is donation-based and by that I mean monetary and or chores. The hostel is as nice as the hikers make it and it includes a woman's bunk room with two showers and bath and two men's bunk rooms with the same as well as a common room that has a small kitchenette with refrigerator, microwave sink and basic needs. There are also free laundry facilities. Off the common room out back there's a very large deck. They provide loaner clothes for you to wear while you're doing your laundry, and request that if you are helping out in the deli or on one of their farms that you wear these clothes out of respect for their religion. We showered and walked just a few doors up the street to a restaurant where we had fried brussel sprouts a beer, a root beer, water and a light dinner. Needless to say we were very thirsty!River and I remained alone in the third floor overflow bunk room and it was blissfully peaceful with the box fan in the window humming us to sleep. It was late. Tomorrow we'll use the bus system to slack pack. It's right behind the hostel and it's $2.","Big Branch campsite

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597496,"I had a fantastic night of sleep getting up to pee only once, but having to walk down to the second floor and into the women's dorm room to use the facilities. A little further then I normally go when I climb out of my tent! Because River and I had planned to take the bus  back to route 103 where we departed the trail yesterday we needed to skip the free hiker breakfast which started at 7: 30 and instead went to the deli and ordered a couple of breakfast sandwiches to enjoy there and lunch sandwiches to go. After we eat our breakfast we went back upstairs and packed our lunch sandwiches into our day bags. We thought the Ludlow Bus left every hour so instead of catching the 7 am bus we decided we would catch the 8. Unfortunately when we got to the bus station we learned that the bus leaves at 7 and 4 so we called for a taxi. The taxi driver Greg knew exactly where we needed to be dropped off and brought us right there. Today we would be summiting Killington.Without wasting any time we got right to climbing over Beacon Hill. We stopped for lunch at Governor Clement shelter, passed a sign for Mount Katahdin 500 Miles which was pretty exciting to see, and even snacked on some wild raspberries. Then we got right to climbing Pico which seemed to take forever and had no switchbacks. Near the top and 1. 3 miles from Killington Peak we got our first view of her. so near yet so far. The rest of the ascent was actually easier than climbing Piko itself.We arrived at Cooper Lodge shelter tenting area and promptly took the blue blaze point two miles up to the peak. About two-thirds of the way up I turned around and looked to see the most magnificent view rising up behind me but unbenounced to me as I face the rocks. Finally reaching the top I was in awe and I just stood there drinking in the distant mountains all around me. the lodge had already closed for the day so no snacks or beverages were available and the gondola was going to stop running shortly so we headed on over to the platform to make sure that we wouldn't be faced with our option b which would be to hike down today. We're slackpacking so there's no way for us to stay up here. River approach the gondola attendant and explained that we are through hiking and looking to get down from the summit this evening and come back up in the morning to resume our hike. We were ushered on to the gondola free of charge since the tickets are sold in the ticket office at the base of the mountain. when we departed at the bottom the attendant there told us that the bus would come in approximately 10 minutes not far away from where we were. This was great news! In less than 10 minutes the bus arrived and we hopped on. It made several stops before arriving at the bus station Behind The Yellow Deli but we didn't care because we had great conversation with Them and Poppy two sisters who were up visiting and day hiking together.When the bus dropped us off we went right to the deli and got down to the business of showering and putting on clean clothes so that we could get some dinner. We dined at the deli and I had a delicious salad, chili and Peach matte iced tea. After dinner we walked to the yogurt shop and back climbing the stairs to our oasis and journaling for a few minutes before falling asleep.","Route 103 mile 1683.1

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597592,"I slept well again but got up twice to go to the bathroom. This morning we were leaving a little later because we needed to take the gondola to the top of Killington and it doesn't start running until 10 a.m. so we enjoyed the hiker breakfast in the deli. It was really wonderful to see so many hikers helping out in the kitchen, serving and washing dishes. Breakfast was scrambled eggs with vegetables and cheese served with rice and toast. There was also fresh fruit on the table and plenty of coffee and matte. After breakfast I went to the bus station and waited for River to join me to catch the bus back to Killington. She went to the fresh juice place prior to the bus station. It took a while to get to the mountain because there are several stops along the way but the ride was certainly relaxing.
When we arrived at Killington we used the restroom and were ready for the gondola ride back to the peak. River went and introduced herself to the gondola attendant explaining that we had riden down the night before and as thru-hikers needed to get back to the peak to resume our hike. We were ushered onto a gandola and taken up to the top. Awesome! the lodge was open so we decided we would fuel up with a nice high calorie snack and enjoy the view before resuming our hike. I grabbed the smallest Ben & Jerry's ice cream container I've ever seen and a protein shake and sat outside in an Adirondack chair mesmerised by my surroundings and the realization that I walked here from West Virginia. It took awhile for it to sink in just how amazing it is to have accomplished this much and I'm looking forward to finishing Vermont and being in New Hampshire and eventually the rest of the journey. It was after 11: 30 when we finally started down the blue blaze trail back to Cooper's Lodge and Northbound on the AT.There really wasn't a whole lot once we got down to Cooper's Lodge and it was basically just a hike through the green tunnel though there were several nice areas and a good majority of the trail today was favorable with soft footing and beautiful Pine Forest. We had been texting Wind Eagle for the last couple of days and she was staying at the Long Trail Inn waiting for her sister to arrive to hike with her. We agreed that if we could finish early enough today and get ourselves over to the Inn from Route 100 that we would have a beer together. We haven't seen wind Eagle since Pennsylvania! We stopped at Churchill shelter for lunch and then proceeded northbound eventually walking through Gifford Woods State Park which we both felt was absolutely beautiful. I stopped at the picnic area just admiring the beauty of the space and waited for River. When she arrived a Subaru entered into the park and stopped in front of us. We recognized the two women and dog inside as people who we had spoken to up on the peak. They asked us if we needed a ride and we gratefully accepted. We walked the remaining short section through the woods from the park out to Route 100 and they picked us up on the road.They drove us to the Long Trail Inn where we met with Wind Eagle. These two women were absolutely wonderful and we chatted for a while in the parking lot. Kaiji and Carrie ( not certain I spelled their names correctly). When they drove away the 3 of us entered into the pub. We decided to have dinner since it was dinner time and we were of course starving now. We had a wonderful visit with Wind Eagle and I actually had two beers! Unusual for me. We then called the taxi driver who had driven us yesterday and he picked us up to bring us back to The Yellow Deli. When we got close to The Yellow Deli he dropped us off about a block away. The street was closed for a big block party. It was late for us, around 9pm  but we got an ice cream sundae and headed up to our room in the hostel. We saw Aysh and let him know that we would like to stay a third night which is the maximum allowed.I have a disease that can flare up due to physical or psychological stress. I've been coping with a flare up since we stopped early to camp by the river a few nights ago. Some of my symptoms are difficult to manage in the backcountry and cause me a lot of pain, discomfort and additional stress. Staying at this hostel where I feel comfortable and can hike without my pack and hike shorter days is helping me to manage this flare up. Staying active is helpful. Staying at the Yellow Deli has certainly come at an appropriate time for me. We took our ice cream up to our room where we enjoyed it before I brushed my teeth and crawled into my bunk. I'm very tired and fatigued and I'm looking forward to another wonderful night of sleep.","Killington Peak

I stripped my bunk and grabbed the broom from downstairs and swept our room. When I returned the broom River was with someone from the deli getting fresh sheets so we could make up the 4 bunks in our room for the next hikers. I cleaned the half bath on the 2nd floor that we have been using and swept the hall outside the dorm rooms. It was time for breakfast now so we went down to the deli and I helped out serving breakfast which was really fun. After that we finished making the bunks. Today my friend Kim F is picking us up to spend the day with her in Killington at her condo. I'm looking forward to spending some time with her and seeing Brian who will be coming for the day. It's nice to be so close now to my family and friends. River ran out for a couple of things and I hung out at the hostel cleaning and washing sheets for a while. I found these chores to be a reminder of normal life and really comforting. When Kim arrived we went to the farmers market together which was a half block away and had a good time buying berries and other goodies. Then it was off to Price Chopper, Panera, Comcast and Kim's condo where Brian was waiting for us in the parking lot. He brought us a resupply and our bathing suits so we could enjoy the hot tub and pool together. I was really happy to see him! 
After a snack we all enjoyed the hot tub and pool and had invited Wind Eagle and her sister Ruth to join us. It was very therapeutic and relaxing. After Wind Eagle and Ruth departed we went on a mission out a dirt road to see if could access the trail as it crosses Chateauguay Rd so Kim could slack pack us tomorrow and use that as a pick up point. We could get 2 miles from the trail crossing. River and I decided that the slack pack would be worth the extra 2 mile walk on a dirt road and agreed to the pick up point. We were of course all starving now so we stopped for dinner at a BBQ place on the way back. Brian stayed a little longer but around 10pm it was time to say goodnight to him and let him get on his way back home and I needed sleep. 
I brushed and put on my pajamas and rolled out my sleeping pad on the living room floor. The slider was open and the fresh air was really nice to fall asleep to. I've learned how Kim takes her tea so that I can make her a cup when I wake her up early to drop us at Route 100.","

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597603,"I was up at 6am as usual and quietly got myself ready. River started our breakfast of scrambled eggs with sauteed vegetables, avocado and fresh fruit while I made Kim's tea. Kim was awake when I delivered the tea to her bedside table, that's a good sign! She had us at the trail head just after 8am. Early in the hike I felt like today would be a rambling scenic stroll past Kent Pond and Thundering Falls. But once we were past that area we started climbing Quimby which Aligator had previously shared was ""surprising"" to her. Yup. I see why. Once we reached the top of Quimby we were soaked in sweat and bounced down a little to some power lines before going back up to hit another summit. We stopped for a quick lunch at Stony Brook shelter before finishing the descent to Stony Brook and a footbridge where we came across a nice gravel road that is not on any of our guides or maps, but was clearly passable because there was a Subaru parked there with the hatch open and no one around. We noted a very sweet looking campsite near the brook and the area was unexpectedly semi-open and inviting. And then there it was.....one more climb. So many of the climbs in northern VT have been without switchbacks. I was drenched in sweat by the time I reached the top where River and I had the same idea of texting Wind Eagle to let her know about the terrain. Ruth is not experienced and these climbs today may be overwhelming if they don't break them up and perhaps camp at the site near the footbridge. We crossed a couple more streams and finally came out to Chateauguay Road after having enough signal to email Kim confirming the pick up time. 
We took a right onto the dirt road and began walking and expressing how passable the road would be with my 4 Runner. And then about a half mile down that all changed. We were faced with giant mud puddles that we had to navigate around thru the woods. The conditions continued to deteriorate until the road was completely gone. What remained was a stream bed complete with water and mud just totally ravaged by mother nature and the obvious aid of 4 wheelers. Even some of the old culverts had been moved to the side. So we rocked and mud hopped never able to look up for nearly 1.5 miles until the road appeared again. We agreed that there was no way we could walk back thru that in the morning and we'd need to find another way in. We were really happy to see Kim and her dog Baci who were there to meet us. She had cold soda for us and Baci had kisses! We stopped for snacks at the store on the way back to Kim's. I needed a food reward in the form of a Mounds bar! Kim's friend Lisa came over and we all sat in the hot tub together visiting even though the hot tub wasn't working today. It needed a reset and the electrical panel is locked. The maintenance man did offer to come over but that would be 45 minutes, so we just enjoyed visiting in a lukewarm tub until suddenly we were joined by children. We were pruned anyway...time to get out.
While we were hiking today River's friends Pete and Michelle from Michigan who were scheduled to arrive tomorrow texted and said they would be there tonight, a day early.They are coming to Killington for a Jeep Jamboree and they want to slack pack us while they're here. We had a nice salad and burgers for dinner and River and I worked late on Kim's laptop and 2 phones pulling up maps to find another way to get to the trail crossing on Chateauguay Rd. Pete and Michelle would get us there in the Jeep. River even called the sheriff's office to see about the road from the other side. It was really late, around 11pm when we finally had the plan nailed down and I went to bed. Kim will drop us at Michelle and Pete's rental in the morning. The 2nd bedroom has 3 twin beds so we'll spend 2 nights there and be slack packed for 2 days. I'm excited to meet these people, River had talked so much about them and their little girl Jana. Plus 2 more days of slack packs and showers! I will make Kim tea again in the morning and she will only have to drive us 5 minutes away instead of way out on dirt roads.","VT Route 100

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597677,"I slept until a little after 6am. It was a late night for me. Sometimes the down side of town stays is a compromise on the hours of sleep I can get. I got up and packed up my quilt and sleeping pad and redied my backpack. I brushed my teeth, showered, started breakfast and made Kim's tea. Baci jumped off the bed happy to see us still here. Kim was up in no time ready to go but the maintenance man was there regarding the hot water issue from the day before when River and I took cold showers. We left condo at 8:20 and Kim dropped us off at Pete and Michelle's place. I hugged her goodbye and it was emotional for me. I can't explain it fully. It's just a heartfelt gratitude for the help, caring and concern. It happens to me with friends and family as well as total strangers. 
I met Pete, Michelle and their sweet 9 year old daughter Jana and we put our packs in the house and day bags in the Jeep. They insisted I sit up front because I'm taller. So I had a front row seat when we had to 4 wheel. River navigated Pete in with a combination of GPS and hand written directions. Pete was delighted when he saw the class 4 road sign. When we approached the trail head we saw Krista and Ryan there with their dog Iggy. They looked bewildered and also exhausted. They were having a tough day. It was after 10 when we started hiking. A climb first and then a snack at lookout cabin. A privately owned cabin available to hikers for overnight stay with a nice view from a platform on the roof. River went up, I didn't. We snacked there with Krista, Ryan and Iggy before descending. We stopped at the Wintturi shelter for lunch and water and they joined us again. Water was difficult but the comments in Guthooks and another hiker leas us to a second spring where we had more success and I pumped for myself and Krista and Ryan. 
I hiked on before River but stopped to pee and she passed me without knowing. For miles she was trying to catch up with me thinking I was in front and I was trying to catch her. But when I got to the  climb at Dana Hill and there were no switchbacks I'd hit a wall. River was done too and it was 6:30 when Pete and Michelle picked us up at Bartlett Brook Rd. 
We drove thru Woodstock stopping for dinner but there wasn't much there and a nice pizza place in town had burned down that day. A local suggested a place on the way back to Killington so we stopped there and enjoyed dinner together. Jana was at her cousin's house visiting. When we got back to the house I showered and got ready for bed and climbed in exhausted. Everyone else was up. It won't bother me though, I can sleep through anything these days!","Chateauguay Rd mile 1715.3

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597946,"I vaguely remember hearing the sound machine come on and River and Jana climb into bed. The sound of the ocean filled the room with a sense of calm and relaxation. I was so tired I just continued sleeping. I got up once to pee around 2pm then slept until 6am. Michelle spoiled us by cooking breakfast. Crispy bacon and scrambled eggs with vegetables. We filled up and hopped in the Jeep with Pete for a ride to the trail head on Bartlett Brook Rd. By the time we got there it was 8:45 and raining. The forecast is for rain all day. It's a good thing we're slack packing. I won't have to put on wet clothes in the morning!In a half mile we were at Pomfret Rd. The sign on the tree says Loon and Firefly live a short walk down the road and the back porch is open to hikers. The refrigerator is stocked with treats for purchase. I hit the steps in time with the thunder. Loon and Firefly were home and came out to talk with us. We enjoyed conversation while I drank a Starbucks frappachino. Okay, I guzzled it. It was awesome! The storm lingered and we waited it out for 1.5 hrs before hiking on. When we stopped at thistle hill shelter for lunch the rain was fizzling out. There weren't many hikers out today. In fact we saw no one until the shelter where 2 strolled in for lunch. Chili who is hiking with Stripper who we met at the Yellow Deli. Stripper is waiting for him in Norwich. Chili needs to see a doctor about an ingrown toenail. After lunch we hiked down and thru W Hartford. The general store is closed but the sign shop up the street is very hiker friendly. We ran into Chili again there. We continued our road walk under I-89 to the corner of Tigertown Rd and Podunk Rd and called it quits, saving a small climb for morning and fresh legs. Michelle picked us up and we stopped at the Town Butcher in Woodstock for a snack . When we got back to the house we took hot showers while Michelle started burgers for us. She left to go back to family in Rutland for dinner and River and I enjoyed our burgers and then I crawled into bed to get some journaling done and sleep.","Bartlett Brook Rd mile 1728.3

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597947,"I slept okay, not as well as last night. It might be because Jana and the sound machine had a sleep over at her cousin's house. Darn! Once again Michelle made us a fabulous breakfast while we got ready. It was a bit involved trying to dry out our shoes...with the blow dryer and the electric baseboard heat. But I was able to put on mostly dry shoes and knew that I would walk them dry in a short time. Pete dropped us off at the corner of Podunk and Tiger Town and we climbed Happy Hill. I wasn't happy about it but it had to be done. I was however looking forward to the end of the day today when I would hike into NH. Because it's my home state and because I'd get a shower and laundry and because tomorrow I get to see the podiatrist. My foot pain has become almost unbearable. I hope there's a solution to making it better. When we emerged from the woods onto Elm St in Norwich I almost cried. At the end of the 1st driveway were 2 Adirondack chairs and a cooler with soda. There was also a mailbox with a hiker journal. We sat for at least 30 minutes and said hello to the owners when they returned home. After our refreshment we continued down Elm and eventually onto Main St to the trail angel putting us up tonight. Just before the house a silver Lab escaped it's owner and ran across the busy street to us. River and I both stepped on her leash and gave her love while her owner made her way across the traffic to us. Ellafreese loves hikers. Her owner Jenny is the pastor at St Barnabas church. Jenny and the church take in hikers for the night. We checked into our place right next door and after a brief rest resumed our hike across the Connecticut River and into Hanover NH free of our gear. We stopped for a late lunch at Molly's and connected with Bill Y. Bill has some zpacks that Eddyman and Alligator left for us to borrow. He's also a trail angel who helps hikers with rides. After lunch we hiked up over velvet rocks and down to Trescott Rd where Bill met us at 6:30. Bill brought the packs with him and drove us into town to the co-op so we could pick up dinner. We only had an hour to spend with him because we had laundry to do and to switch backpacks and we wanted to observe the 9pm quiet time for our host family. Bill was an incredible wealth of knowledge and provided us with a wonderful map and schedule for hiking thru the Whites. He bought our dinner which was above and beyond and we enjoyed coffee while talking with him at the co-op. We were at our accommodations just after 7:30 and got our laundry done before 9pm. I settled into bed and journaled a little. Tomorrow we will get up early and clean the apartment we're in and wash the linens so we can leave the place ready for the owner's parents who are coming in the afternoon. Brian will be coming to take me to the podiatrist and anywhere else we need to go.","I-89 W Hartford mile 1738.5

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597948,We were up early after a very restful night. I'm feeling so good right now except my feet. But today's the day I get to see if that can change. We cleaned and got the beds all ready. When Brian arrived around 10am he took the owners dog Rocky out for a quick potty break and we loaded our gear into the 4runner. We waived goodbye to Omar who was on the phone and texted Lilly to let her know that the apartment was all ready for her parents. We headed toward Lebanon for breakfast and I got an email from my podiatrist offering me an earlier appointment due to a cancellation. I accepted. We had an awesome breakfast and then a fiasco trying to get to the doctor's office but finally did. Brian came in with me which was a good thing. The doctor wanted to calm the nerve in my foot with a big needle and I'm certain I would have chickened out and the result would probably be intolerable pain that would likely end my hike. But he and the doctor both suggested that I accept the recommended shot of cortisone.  I cringed and the doctor tipped me back in the chair and inserted the needle thru the top of my foot moving it around in there quite a bit. I focused on breathing. I hate needles. I was also prescribed new shoes and insoles. So after that nice needle I had to walk on my foot which was now feeling even more unhappy as we shopped. I got what the doctor ordered and wore them out of the store. A new pair of Hoka trail runners and soft fit insoles to support my high arches. Then Brian drove us to Eastern Mountain Sports and Riteaid.With our chores complete we went back to Norwich and checked in at Jenny's house for the night and then had dinner with Brian at Jessie's. It was then goodnight to my wonderful husband so that we could sleep and he could get home to give our cat his insulin shot. I made up my bed and journaled for a little bit. My foot has settled down now and I hope the shot is effective. I'm looking forward to trying out my new feet tomorrow! Bill Y is picking us up at 8am for a stop at Lou's in Hanover for a donut on the way to the trail head on Trescott Rd. River's feeling homesick today. Jenny's cats are a source of comfort to her and I hope it helps her to love on them.,"

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597949,"I woke up at 6am showered and got ready. I stripped my bed and headed downstairs for a quick coffee before Bill arrived before 8am and met Jenny. After a couple of pictures we rolled over to Hanover and took more pictures at the sidewalk plaque and in front of Lou's. I got a GF muffin which I washed down with a chocolate milk and a breakfast cookie for my 2nd breakfast later.  Bill was generous once again and had us at the trailhead around 8:30. He's such a wonderful man and I look forward to keeping in touch with him. I'm sorry that we didn't meet his wife Sara but being from NH I will have opportunity. The trail ambled along for the 1st 4 miles. We arrived at Three Mile Rd and waited about 5 minutes for River's friends from NY to arrive to take us to lunch in Lyme. We had a great time with them and a wonderful meal at the tavern before returning to the trail at 1pm. We crossed Mink Brook and then the ascent of Moose mountain began. I've hiked it before but not with a full pack. After the climb the trail descends back down to Goose Pond Rd and then all the way back up to Holt's ledge. The falcons weren't out when I passed by but the raspberries were so I scarfed them down careful not to fall off the ledge but making River nervous. NH really knows how to greet AT nobo hikers...by lacking switchbacks. There's nothing that says Welcome to NH like a straight up and down climb or 2! I was very happy to reach the shelter. I had already wrapped my mind around sleeping in the shelter but when I saw it was pretty full I grabbed a tent spot and set up. The last non-sloping spot. It was almost 7pm and I hate getting to camp so late. Iggy and his parents (Krista and Ryan) arrived while I was getting water and I gave them my tenacious tape and needle and thread to make tent repairs. Wind Eagle arrived around 7:30. I rushed thru my chores of water, dinner, hanging my bag and got into bed. I'm exhausted from the climbing but my feet feel better. I have a blister on my pinkie toe from hiking in the rain a few days ago but my cramping is about 50% better and the general discomfort I think will be better once my feet are used to the shoes and insoles. Time will tell but so far I'm feeling happy to have taken a needle in the foot.","Trescott Rd

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597950,"I slept well but could hear rustling in Krista and Ryan's tent most of the night so I don't think they slept well. I packed up my tent before making breakfast. Wind Eagle, Chili and Stripper are here also. And we met Dave a section hiker contemplating the trail name Oatmeal. 
I left camp at 7:45. Once again it was a full day of climbing without switchbacks. Up Lambert Ridge and Smarts Mountain. I met 2 red liners climbing Lambert Ridge and had lunch at the top  By the time I made it to the fire tower I skipped the climb of it for views and opted for the steep .2 + hike for water because I was almost out. I didn't even have the energy to look inside the ranger's cabin which is open to hikers. I felt like the day was all work and no reward but the good news is my feet are even better today. I can't believe I lived with that pain for so long. What was I thinking? I descended Smarts Mountain only to go up again to Eastman ledges and finally hexacuba shelter at 6:30. I found Chili sitting at the bottom of the blue blaze trail waiting for Stripper. He knew her knees were hurting and it was a tough day for her so he would carry her pack up to the shelter. Tonight I'll sleep in the shelter with River, Wind Eagle, Chili, Stripper and Pirate. Oatmeal is in a tent and there is one other tenter we haven't seen. I got water at the stream .4 before the shelter and it's enough for tonight and tomorrow morning. I made macaroni and cheese for dinner and ate it all. Then I brushed my teeth and helped River with the bear lines and we hung our bags. The forecast tomorrow is rain after 8am. Everyone except Pirate is going to be up at 4:30 a.m. and hiking around 5:30. Stripper is a wealth of knowledge because she's hiked most of the trail twice. She said we shouldn't hike Mt Cube in the rain. Its a lot if rock and exposure. So we all agreed that we'd be up and over it before 8am and at the road for a shuttle ride to Hikers Welcome Hostel to ride out the rain. I wrote my journal and it's about 9pm. I don't generally sleep well in shelters but I hope tonight is different.","Trapper John shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598178,"I was up before the birds when someone's alarm softly and pleasantly sounded. I slept lightly all night, asleep but yet aware. I'm not feeling tired though. I was on the trail at 5:45 a.m. and I absolutely loved the climb up Mt Cube. It was very windy and cloudy but without rain. I sent Brian a text before I reached the summit so he'd know what the plan was for a nero. The summit provided a gorgeous view of layers of mountains. I stood on the tallest rock I saw and steeled myself against the wind to get a few pictures before scrambling down to continue north. The descent was really gentle with a few rocks but mostly pine needle carpet. Luscious on my feet. It's so wonderful to be back in NH! Within 5 minutes of reaching route 25A the shuttle pulled up. Bisquick introduced himself and we loaded our gear in. Chili and Oatmeal slack packed the 9.7 miles to the hostel but the 4 of us women enjoyed the van, especially since it was now raining. 
We checked into the hostel and Rainbow was there. I showered and made my bunk and River threw our laundry in the washer. I was sitting in the community room having a cup of coffee when I felt a loving hand caressing my neck. It was my wonderful husband. He drove up to surprise me! Always so great to see him. We went to lunch alone and it was so nice to have a few minutes in private with him. He brought a piece of burger back for Iggy who had arrived at the hostel before we left. Iggy is his new friend. I layed in my bunk resting and journaling in the afternoon. At 5pm River and I got a ride to the same snack bar I had lunch at with Brian and had dinner. Rain is the forecast for the week. Tomorrow I'll slack pack the 9.7 from 25C to the hostel.","Hexacuba shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598181,"There's an older man here at the hostel with some health issues. He is spending the summer in the area staying in hostels and state parks. He doesn't hike much anymore because of his health. He lives in Texas. He hiked the trail 22 years ago. He and 2 younger guys who chose not to shower when they got here were up past 10pm talking loudly. The 2 guys had bunks above me and River and when they came to bed the older man sat on the couch in the bunk room after scooting Iggy off it. He fell asleep and eventually laid down for the night but he snored loudly and had terrible coughing fits. Everyone's sleep was disturbed. If he's here tonight I may move to the other bunkhouse. I had oatmeal for breakfast and then packed a day bag with lunch, snacks, filter and other essentials. I was signed up for the 7:30 shuttle which took us back to the trail head at 25C so I could hike the 9.7 miles to the hostel. Just as we left the driveway it started to pour. Perfect. I started hiking around 8am and the first bit was a small climb. Today's terrain was easy with lots of flat trail and 2 small ""bumps"". It poured the entire time and I stopped only for 5 minutes to pee and throw some pepperoni slices down my pie hole. It was so miserable I couldn't look up, I just looked down at the trail the entire time and finished in 4hrs and 20 minutes. When I arrived at the hostel Chilli was already back from hiking moosikauke and he'd been scared at the top in the rain and cold and wind. Still, he'd knocked it out in 5 hrs. I showered and rinsed the mud off my gators and water logged shoes and put my sandals on to let my pruned feet dry out. Refreshed and accomplished I had a root beer and the lunch from my bag I had chosen not to eat in the rain, a tuna packet in evoo and cheddar crackers. I hung out in the common room half pretending to be interested in the movie Mud Smeller and her husband were watching, Space Balls. River and WE (Wind Eagle) came in about an hour and a half after me and we shared a dryer cycle to get our wet clothes dry for tomorrow. Just before 5pm we ordered from the snack bar a few miles away and the shuttle took 6 people for pickup. My burger, fries and root beer float were delicious! I learned about an incident with Rainbow from last night she's tenting here and had gotten a chocolate bar from the common room, eaten half and left her tent open with the other half in there to go do something quickly. When she returned to her tent it was occupied by a chicken consuming skunk. Thankfully he didn't spray! The older man from last night is gone. So I returned to my bunk to journal after brushing my teeth. I'm waiting for dark so I can sleep. I'm thinking about tomorrow and the 9.5 miles I'll hike over Mt Moosikauke. I'm nervous about the whites. I hope I have what I need mentally and physically to get thru this section well. I know it will be difficult because it's the most difficult section of the trail.

Before dawn I was awake watching the sky turn brighter through the windows on the gable end and just before 6 I started to stretch in preparation for the day. I felt a little restless getting ready to climb Mount Moosilauke today. I packed my day bag and went downstairs to the common area where I scored the two apple and cinnamon oatmeal packages that were up for grabs and made myself breakfast along with a cup of coffee. 
The shuttle left promptly at 7: 30 and River almost didn't make it having to squeeze an 8th person into a 7 passenger van but it worked. It's been raining a lot here and as we traveled across Route 118 a section of the road had been washed out. We waited for the construction vehicles to move, about 15 or 20 minutes before we could pass through. We got to the trailhead and started hiking around 8: 30  and it was already raining steadily. I noticed that my legs were shaky when I crossed the first two streams so I took a moment to take a couple of deep breath and remind myself that I can do this. Lacking confidence will not help me today. The higher I hiked on the mountain the harder it rained. I absolutely loved climbing up the rocky north side of the mountain to the peak where the wind was blowing the rain sideways and I was thankful to have my rain gear. I made a quick Marco Polo video for Brian from the top and sent it before tucking my phone back safely into its zip lock baggie. As I started the descent I noticed a trail crew out there working, which really surprised me in this weather. They do such a great job keeping these trails accessible to us.The descent was quite nice, actually steep for a little while and of course wet and slippery but I only fell once just slightly and enjoyed the way the terrain mellowed out after that. As it did, the rain stopped and the sun came out so I was mostly dry except my feet and it felt so warm and happy. But by the time I got to the first paved road the sky had opened up again with a new downpour. Not looking at my phone and map I assumed the road was Route 25 and I exited the trail, took a left and begin hiking to where I thought I'd find the hostel but instead I found a sign that said welcome to Warren. Immediately I knew I was not on Route 25 so with the rain stopping once more I pulled out my phone and sure enough I had given myself an extra road walk. I was on High St. I turned around and walked back up the paved Road and entered the trail on the left stopping at Jeffers Shelter just to see what it was like and met a young couple there hiking southbound who were staying for the night. I didn't stay long and headed back onto the trail which dumped me out on Route 25. Across the way was a Class C camper parked and the gentleman yelled to me that he had ice cream! Of course you know I ran right over! and while I didn't have an ice cream because they were ice cream sandwiches. I did enjoy a can of iced tea and conversation with three other hikers and eventually River. We toasted our drinks and I hiked on with River to the hostel where are we got ourselves clean and dry and eventually fed when the shuttle went out to the Country Store at 5pm. There are many hikers here tonight, I expect that they are getting out of the rain because the forecast is calling for more serious rain and thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday. I'm not sure at this point if we will attempt to hike in that. I think the wisest thing to do is to look at the forecast again in the morning and make an informed decision because it would be foolish to be on any of these 4000' balds in the middle of a thunderstorm. It's 8:25 and I've brushed my teeth and heading up to my bunk.

At 5am I began stretching and moving, putting on my clothes to go down to the bathroom. When I returned to my bunk everyone else was moving about. I repacked my backpack after adjusting the arc and the shoulder straps. It's more comfortable now. This is the zpacks backpack that Eddyman let me borrow and it takes a couple of days to get things dialed in for my body. The lower support where the hip belt is really has an impact on my lower back. I had my oatmeal and a coffee and squared up with Bisquick for my stay. Then I hopped in the van with River for the 7:30 shuttle to Kinsman Notch. I sat up front for a change and enjoyed the ride. The crews are still repairing route 118. The sky was cloudy but patches of blue were visible. We used the forest service privy at the trailhead parking area and set out across route 112 and began a very long climb up to the summit of Wolf Mt. The climb was steep and long filled with moss and algae covered slick, wet rocks and roots. A stream ran down the middle of the trail and several times I stopped to make sure I was still on trail and not in an actual stream. Here in the whites there seems to be a definite lack of white blazes. The terrain was definitely challenging and again we were hiking in clouds being dripped on by them and trees all day. We ran across Mudsmeller and Cutie Handful who had left the hostel yesterday for Eliza Brook shelter. They had stayed there last night but realized they can't make it thru the Whites this way so today they're hiking back to Kinsman Notch. They're going to do some day hiking and stay at some huts. We talked for a moment and River and I decided to move on without lunch in order to beat the rain to the shelter. We made it to the shelter around 3pm and met up with Rainbow who was taking a zero tbere. She gave us tea bags and we enjoyed a hot cup of tea just as the rain started. Pirate is also taking a zero here because he's wet and everything he owns is wet. Both of them left the hostel yesterday with Mudsmeller and Cutie Handful. This rain is really miserable. Before long the shelter was full and people were setting up tents in the rain. I'm so glad we got space in the shelter. Voyager came in with 3 boy scouts. They had a bite to eat and rested before moving north and we watched them rock hop across the river. The rain had stopped for a few minutes and River and I realized we have to cross this water tomorrow. It's swollen and many of the rocks are covered. I'm not sure how we'll do it but we'll find a way to rock hop or put our camp sandals on and just forde it. We cooked dinner around 6pm. Pegasus showed up. He took some time off trail and is back to finish up. He's with some of the other guys and a girl here in the shelter. The conversation was nice, just a bunch of hikers stranded in the rain not certain what tomorrow will bring for hiking. But the consensus is safely and of course we'd all love a view! It's 7:40 now and pouring. I've brushed my teeth and I'm in my PJs in my bag. River and I will be up at 4:30 a.m. and if it's not raining we'll try to get over the Kinsmans and to Kinsman Pond shelter, Lonesome lake hut or if the weather is agreeable to I-93 and into Lincoln for the night.","Kinsman Notch route 112
",Eliza Brook shelter,"Jul 25, Wed",7.50
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598791,"It poured all night and I was awakened many times, the first by late arriving hikers with headlamps checking to see if there was any room in the shelter. There wasn't and we were packed in tight. The rest of my wakefulness was due to the rain. I was thinking about the already swollen river we'd need to cross in the morning and what impact all this rain will have on it and the rest of the trail. River had set her alarm clock for 4: 30 and when it went off it was still pouring outside so we both went back to sleep. the next time I woke up it was 6: 48 and the shelter was still full of sleeping hikers. Pretty unusual as many hikers are up and out between 6-7am. But soon after people did begin to stir, sitting up in their sleeping bags thinking about the day and making breakfast. Some of the tenters who unfortunately did not stay so dry overnight made their way to the shelter to commiserate about the weather and cook out of the rain. We say up and made room for them. After a trip to the river for water one of the hikers came back and said there was no way to cross it to head north. We could hear it's rage from the shelter. Yesterday there were rocks visible and it was still possible to hop across to the other side. Today it was churning and angry and very swift-moving not to mention it had consumed all of the rocks that were above water yesterday making it impossible to hop. It was too risky to forde. The next  couple of hours were spent considering all options such as backtracking to Kinsman Notch, bushwalking upstream, taking a zero in camp, etc., and several of the hikers worked together with their ideas. We were all in the same boat. A group of 5 younger hikers decided to bridge some logs from the shore on the camp side to a large Flat Rock about 3/4 across at the narrowest point downstream. Four logs were placed bridging to the rock and leaving a very large rock hop to the opposite shore. By 10:45  a handful of hikers had crossed on the makeshift bridge successfully. Rainbow River and I decided we would take our chances too. one by one we loosened and unbuckled the straps on our packs and crawled across the logs on our hands and knees inches at a time to the safety of the large flat rock. From there, unable to make the leap to the rock on the opposite shore, I  put on my water sandals  and I walked across the remaining 6' or so of water to safety. Rainbow had gone first and was there to greet me. It was several minutes before I stopped shaking. River crossed last and the 3 of us hiked north together to conquer the Kinsmans. We forded another water crossing and got showered on but most of the rain held off. So much rain had fallen however that the trail was literally a steam and at times I checked to be sure I was actually still on trail. I could feel the water flowing against me as I climbed and hiked. The bog boards were under water which was almost knee deep in spots. Climbing south kinsman was a long and very steep rock scramble.  Over 6 hours later and just 5.8 miles I arrived at the Lonesome Lake Hut at about 5pm. We had all wanted to get to Lincoln but agreed it wasn't in the cards to hike another 4 miles plus an extra mile to the trailhead parking lot where we might be able to hitch a ride. Instead we'd ask for work for stay at the hut if there weren't any empty bunks. I walked into the hut feeling spent and desperate. Emma, one of the croo members was very sweet. I was choking back tears from my emotional depletion while asking if there were any bunks. No, she said, they were full. I asked if I could sleep on the floor in the hut and she asked if I didn't think I could make it the 1.6 to the parking lot. I explained I'm a thru hiker and for me it's longer to the parking area on the AT.  She offered me work for stay and it was all I could do to hold back the waterfall. Rainbow had gotten work for stay before me and she told me her tears did fall. I didn't feel so badly for being emotional. I've heard many hikers say they felt the same.  I told Emma there'd be one more in our group somewhere behind me. River came in an hour later and also got work for stay. After the guests had dinner and the croo washed dishes we were invited to eat with them. Lasagna, salad and broccoli. One of the croo shared her GF pasta and pesto with me. After dinner Rainbow gave me a lindt truffle for my dessert while they had cake. Fire Beast had come in around 8pm after dinner and was given work for stay and some cold leftovers. At 9:30 we were allowed to move the tables and set up our sleeping pads on the floor. Lights went out and the croo went to their bunks. We decorated the hut with our wet and stinky clothes. I hung my bear line as my clothes line and the others used any available hook and bench.  Perhaps we could actually dry out! My low back is in a lot of pain. I don't know if it's the zpack backpack because it presses on my lower back or something else. But it was excruciating to roll over. I also had restless legs . I got up and went out to the bathhouse to go pee again.  I think it's going to be a long night.","Eliza Brook shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598793,"I woke up at 5 but stayed on the floor trying to stretch out a bit before attempting to get up. All night long my back hurt making rolling over a teeth grinding, wincing event. I didn't sleep well at all. We needed to be packed up by 6:15 so the croo could set up for breakfast. We undecorated our still soggy clothes from the room and put the tables and benches back. Then we depatrted the space so the croo could do their thing. 
After putting my wet stuff on the rail outside to try to finish drying it I grabbed a coffee and went down by the lake and stood on the dock. Looking out over the lake was peaceful. It was smooth and the reflection of the clouds and mountains was perfect. I couldn't help but stare at it and take lots of pictures. The hut guests were milling about with coffee in hand and children were bouncing around seemingly excited at the prospect of breakfast. The menu board said chocolate chip pancakes.  I took the opportunity to use the restroom to freshen up, brush my teeth, etc. while the guests were eating. After breakfast the croo cleaned the dishes while we swept and then we had breakfast together. Cold oatmeal and eggs. But it went down okay and the coffee was hot. A little while later it was chore time for us. The ""work"" part of the stay. And until almost 9:30 we wiped down bunks and window sills, folded blankets and swept the 10 bunk rooms in 2 buildings. I was packed and ready to go. At 9:38 Rainbow and I left the dock. River was behind us. Eventuallly she caught up, but not before hiking .4 mile in the wrong direction! We forded 3 times in a short distance, having to walk upstream at Cascade Brook in order to forde safely. Very few hikers on this section of the trail today. We were hiking out to I-93 where Brian and my niece Laura would meet us for a trip to Lincoln for lunch and resupply. Then we would hike up to liberty spring campsite. The 3.4 miles would bring us to the highway and then we'd have a 1 mile walk on another trail to access a parking lot. But Brian parked at Lafayette campground on the west side of the highway and we wouldn't pass that on the AT. So when we popped out and I saw 93 and the exit sign for the flume parking was right next to us I knew he wasn't far away and thus we decided to break the rules and walk along the highway shoulder a short distance to the ramp. He picked us up there, sparing us an extra mile. And he has ice cold drinks for us too. So cold they had slush in them! We had an excellent lunch at Gordie's and just as we were ready to leave the sky grew dark and let go a furious downpour complete with thunder and lightning. River began to break down. We're all at a breaking point with the rain. We agreed we'd stay in town tonight instead of hiking up the 2.6 to liberty spring campsite. We went to the outfitters, had ice cream, brought Rainbow to Chet's hostel and River and I got rooms at Mt Liberty motel where we had showers and laundry. Brian brought our resupply and my Osprey pack, which I exchanged for the zpack hoping it will help my back. He also brought up sizzers and cut my bangs for me so I can see now. After a full day he brought Laura back to her car at Lafayette campground and came back for an extra visit with me which was very sweet. When he arrived my room was full. River, WE and her wife LeAnn were visiting me. WE had decided to get off trail and see a doctor about her knees. She's in a lot of pain and the Kinsmans were the frosting on that cake. I do hope she's able to resume her hike. It was great to see LeAnn whom I haven't seen since she rescued me when I needed new shoes in PA. I crawled into bed after saying goodnight to Brian and I was asleep before he got home. Tomorrow morning Mike, the motel owner will bring us back to the trail at 6:15.","Lonesome lake shelter
",I-93 Lincoln,"Jul 27, Fri",3.40
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598806,"I woke up a little later than I thought and did my morning yoga to help with my back before rolling out of bed. I took a quick shower and dressed my clean clothes that were laundered by the motel owner last night. I texted River and changed the time for our ride to 6:30 and then had some quinoa and pesto for breakfast. It's a high calorie high fat meal without being too filling and I needed it for the climb in front of me. 
Mike dropped us off very close to where we got off trail yesterday and we were on our way. About a tenth of a mile in River realized she was missing her knee brace and turned around to go find where she dropped it. I'm going to rename her ""loses things"" because she's always losing or misplacing something and other hikers behind us who know her often pick them up and return them to her when they see her. The climb was almost 5 miles and sections were very steep. We stopped at Liberty Spring campsite for a snack and rest about half way up. River made reservations for us at highland center for Monday night and then we were back at the climb. Just before the summit of Little Haystack I came upon a granite ledge that I didn't feel I could climb up on with my pack on because of my back pain. I took it off and shoved it up on the ledge in front of me. As I did so another female hiker headed sobo appeared. I grabbed a tree for assistance with the climb and began. Half way up my foot slipped and I spun around with my back to the ledge looking absolutely ridiculous I'm sure. I dropped back down to the ground and let go of the tree. The other hiker moved my pack away from the edge and on the second try I was successful.  Once I was up she sat and slid down and bounced on down the trail out of sight. There was no better way. I stood there looking at the view before me and it just filled me with so much wonder and amazement. What beautiful mountains and valleys. Absolutely gorgeous! I continued on to the summit of Lincoln, Lafayette and Garfield enjoying the views all around me on this Franconia Ridge. There were many hikers here today, mostly day hikers. River caught up to me and we took a break on Lafayette. After our break we descended until we climbed Garfield. I was ready to be done for the day when we came to the Garfield Ridge shelter. We checked in with the caretaker James and set up in the shelter. Pancake, who we'd met at Hikers Welcome Hostel was there. She'd injured her tailbone falling on the descent from Lafayette during the thunderstorm yesterday and was trying to decide if she should get off trail or take another zero and hope it felt better. Her hiking partner Swimmer left the trail because his wife's father passed away. I believe she called her son to make arrangements to be picked up. I felt badly, I could tell she'd been crying. Krista, Ryan and Iggy are here too! This site is very busy and the caretaker was super nice. I got my thru hiker pass which gets me a discount at other sites and free goodies at the huts. I cooked and socialized a bit under the tarped cooking area nearby and then crawled under my quilt after brushing and stowing my bear bag in the box. Great shelter here. I'm hoping my back pain eases and I can sleep better","I-93 Lincoln
",Garfield Ridge shelter,"Jul 28, Sat",10.50
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599010,"I never sleep the best in a shelter. I don't know why that is but I always feel like I'm only half asleep during the night. I was fully awake just before 5am and having to pee but I wanted to be considerate of everyone sleeping and I wasn't sure how difficult it would be for me to get moving. I was sleeping in an area under the loft and there wasn't enough room to stand up until I cleared that space and was in the center of the shelter. I quietly stretched with some poses from my recorded morning yoga to make getting up easier. I do feel like it was easier to roll over last night, not as much pain. I dressed and exited the shelter without incident and went out to pee. By now 2 other hikers were packing up. I returned to the shelter and did the same and brought my pack to the cooking area and seated myself on a bench. It's painful to sit. I feel much better standing and walking. But I made my oatmeal and organized my snacks for the day. River joined me and when I was ready I brushed my teeth and used the privy and departed. I had 1.5 liters of water from the night before so I didn't stop at the bottom of the blue blaze trail to filter any more. I knew that today I'd have a steep rocky descent off Garfield and then a steep and rocky ascent up South Twin. It took at least 30 minutes to loosen up a bit. The descent was everything it promised and with each deep step down I could feel the pounding in my lower back each time my foot dropped down to find the next solid rock. I found myself placing more of my weight on my trekking poles and lengthened them to help me more. The trail was up and down after the steep section not really knowing what it wanted to do and was more enjoyable. 
I arrived at Galehead hut and saw Ryan, Krista and Iggy who left camp after me but passed my on the steep section. It was still way before lunch but a crew member put on some soup for me and I took a 45 minute rest to eat and water myself so I would be best suited for the climb up South Twin right in front of me. Before I finished my soup River arrived and did the same. I met Odie from the Thru Hikers Yearbook and that was cool. He planned a 150 mile hike in NH/ME but was getting off trail early because he'd had his ass kicked enough. It made me feel better knowing that I'm not the only one feeling beat up. I finally accepted the challenge and made the summit of South Twin feeling strong and after that Mt Guyot. The trail gently descended for several miles after that with sections of short steep rocks. Some of them I sat and butt slid down because I was tired from the back pain. When I arrived at Zeland Falls hut I walked past the first entrance and set my pack down on the far end of the porch steps out of the way of most traffic. I went inside and sat down for a moment, my strength earlier in the day being depleted. A crew member who I later knew to be Asha told me if I needed anything to just let him know. I thanked him and said that I was going to rest a few, have a lemonade, fill my water and move on. He spun around and asked me if I was a thru hiker named Puddles. I am I replied. He said he had something for me and I immediately thought Krista and Ryan had left a message as we all planned to stealth camp just outside the protected zone of the shelter. But he went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of root beer and 4 snacks. ""For me?"" I said, filling with emotion. He said my family hiked out to see me but were too early and left them and a note taped to the door I passed by on my way in. I cried even though I tried hard to control the waterfall. I was just toughed that my stepdaughter Crystal, her husband, 3 children and her mother in law hiked miles to surprise me on not so easy trail and left these things and a note expressing their love and pride. It made me well up all night thinking about it. And I had no service to get any message to them. I enjoyed half the root beer right away and saved the other half for dinner. Asha told me of the nearest steath site and when I arrived Krista, Ryan and Iggy were there. I set up and shared my story with them. An hour later River arrived and made camp and we all ate dinner together. I left my food cozy at home when I was there in early July. Krista and Ryan gave me theirs because this is their last cooked trail meal. Tomorrow they get off trail and head home to their normal lives. I'll miss them and seeing Iggy almost every day. They're special people and I hope to see them off trail in the future. It's incredible the relationships that are forged out here on this footpath. With difficulty I got up from my seat of tree roots and got ready for bed, brushing my teeth and crawling into bed. I'd hung a bear line earlier and River was kind enough to hang my bag. Though she did have to rehang the line on a stronger branch first. She knows I'm hurting. She's such an incredible friend. It's been an emotional day for me and I'm feeling more blessed than ever. I'm going to journal and hopefully feel better in the morning.","Garfield Ridge shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599021,"I slept better than I thought I would and did my morning yoga before attempting anything else. It was very difficult to exit my tent but once I did I wandered to the back of the campsite to pee out of site. Krista and Ryan were almost all packed up and ready to go. We said goodbye to them and Iggy who was forced to pose for some pictures. After they left I took my seat on the tree roots from last night and made breakfast. River saw my difficulty in getting up and I expressed that I'm in a lot of pain. I know I need to decide what to do today because I can't hike another day like this. Today's 7.5 miles to Crawford Notch is an easy hike. We have reservations at the AMC Highland Center where I can rest, shower and sit on something other than tree roots that are 6"" off the ground. 
We headed out and hiked together all day, most of it River stayed right behind me. We enjoyed a few minutes at Thoreau Falls off a short sour trail. Later we stopped at the Ethan Pond shelter for a snack and hydrated. I had just a half liter of water with me for the remaining 2.9 miles and opted not to bend over to pump water. River gave me a few sips of hers shortly before we reached the road, I was out. I've decided to call Brian and have him pick me up in the morning so I can see my chiropractor. It's going to be rainy with thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday this week and River and I are at the presidential range which we agreed will not happen under those forecasted conditions. We'll need 2 days to hike that section. The weather will hold us off until the weekend. So the timing is actually good. River's friend Sara from Maine is going to come get her tomorrow afternoon when she finishes the Websterw Cliffs to Mt Pierce section, putting her 7 miles ahead of me. I'll have to make it up before we hike the rest of the range, which we're doing in the south bound direction or sometime after. It will depend on my back and the weather. We arrived at route 302 at 12:40 and crossed the road to the trail head for Webster Cliffs and the AMC shuttle stop. The shuttle is $20 for members and $24 for non members. It departs here at 1:05. We agreed we'd try hitching a ride and if we weren't successful we'd pay for the shuttle. 2 cars passed and a motorcycle who gave us a thumbs up. Then I saw it....the license plate bkpackr ( or close to that) and I knew he'd stop. Rudi was going to the Highland Center anyway and he'd been out bushwacking today to summit some of the peaks without trails. He's a redliner and obviously a cereal hiker if he's out bushwacking! That's nasty work and he has the battle wounds to prove it! By the way a redliner is someone who completes all the trails AMC White Mountain Guide. Seriously devoted, redliners generally take on this task after hiking all the 4,000 footers. Rudi brought us right to the front door and even gave us each a Body Armor hydration drink. An extremely nice man and fun to talk to. Our private double bunk room was ready when we arrived at 1pm. We checked in and showered before heading down to the cafeteria to cash in the $6 bowl of soup, bread and beer our thru hiker passport entitles us to. We met Stripper there and the 3 of us visited while I booked with my chiropractor and confirmed tomorrow morning pickup with Brian. I'm relaxed now, I know I need to get fixed before I can get to the rest of the journey. I'm not off trail yet but I already can't wait to get back!!! River will spend tomorrow night at White Birches campground in a cabin with Stripper and a few days with her friend Sara in Maine. We enjoyed the buffet which was really great and then crawled into bed. With the fan in the window I thought I'd drift right off. Pain is exhausting. But the camp kids were running up and down the hall in and out of each other's rooms after the 10pm quiet time. Clearly the chaperones are oblivious. I hate being broken. But I know this happens to a lot of hikers and recovery is necessary before proceeding. I'm not Wonder Woman. My mind is willing but my body is a day behind. After all I'm officially a part of the decrepit group now. 4 female hikers over 50 with bad knees or some other failing body part. But we still love what we're doing and wouldn't change it.","Stealth camp site mile 1836.9

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599306,"I was at the breakfast buffet around 6:45 and had a huge bowl of oatmeal with raisins and brown sugar, a bowl of yogurt with fresh fruit, a plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash and potatoes. I finished it off with a cup of coffee. I can certainly put away some food! The funny thing is I'll be hungry again in less than 2 hours. I've become one of those people I used to see making return trips to the buffet, swearing I'd never eat like that. But as a thruhiker the calories are necessary. But it doesn't make it less embarrassing. 
I showered and packed my bag and left it in the room for Brian to carry down when he arrives. I waited outside the entrance to the lodge and Brian arrived around 9:40. He went up and got my bag and we loaded up and drove River to the Webster Cliffs trail head where we left off yesterday. Then we headed back to Route 3 and into the town of Twin Mountain where we stopped for breakfast because Brian hadn't eaten yet. Lucky for me...I was hungry again! So I had 2 eggs with homemade hash and a GF bagel with butter and extra cream cheese. I know....I feel like a hobbit sometimes with the number of times I eat in a day. I had a noon appointment at my chiropractor so Brian raced down the highway while I was too busy agonizing over the pain sitting caused me to be concerned about what the speedometer said. Lucky for him. I turned the seat warmer on to try for any relief. None was found. I got to the Dr right at noon. I received treatment that provided minor instant relief of my headache and a bit of freedom for my legs. When we left I rode home laying down in the back seat. Much more comfortable! The rest of the day I iced and took Advil and layed down or stood up as much as possible. Oh, and I got ice cream!On Wednesday I went back at 9:45am for another treatment. More successful but I'm in so much pain still and I couldn't sit. Again I rode in the car laying down in the back seat. My chiropractor suggested I may need to call my PCP for pharmaceutical assistance. Its not my first choice but I understand what he's saying. I do prefer natural remedies over prescription when possible. I was at my PCP office at 11:45. She understands me and she's also a hiker. I gave her my goal to be back on trail and she prescribed a steroid and muscle relaxer for me to help me sleep and reduce the inflammation in my back so I can heal. I want to get back on trail and I want to be sure I'm well enough to not reinjure myself. We discuss some back strengthening exercises also and I'll add them to my morning practice. Brian brought me right to lunch (I'm starving again) and then to get my prescriptions. I took the first dose immediately. I'm ready to be unbroken!! Kyle and Lisa came over for dinner and we enjoyed a BBQ and store bought sides. Not typical of me as I love to cook but I'm giving myself a break for healing. 
By Thursday morning I was able to sit with less discomfort. Some real relief! I rested more and spent an hour or so at the office completing a couple of minor tasks successfully sitting before going for an ice cream at Richardson's dairy. The best! 
On Friday I was even more improved and made breakfast for Brian and myself before heading to visit Crystal, Emily, Violet and Silas who hiked out to see me on trail last Sunday and left the treats for me at Zealand Falls shelter. Sam was at work and we unfortunately didn't get to see him. I had a fantastic couple of hours with them on their small farm and showed them what I carry in my backpack. Then we headed home so I could rest more. We watched the afternoon severe storms on TV while some of them played out in our front yard. I was really feeling that breaking myself came at a good time as the visions of me sprinting across the presidential range trying to get below tree line and away from these storms gave me heart palpitations! I'm glad not to be up there today! Brian was scheduled to see a baseball game with a friend but it was rained out. So we went to the store and I baked chocolate chip cookies and banana bread for him. It was nice to do something for him and brought about a sense of normalcy. Tomorrow he will bring me to North Conway and I'll be ready to hike early Sunday morning. It's been a beautiful few days with him. But I'm looking forward to resuming my hike also.","Crawford Notch AMC Highland Center

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599661,"I stayed up late last night and slept in a little. It was luxurious! We made breakfast together and I bagged up the chocolate chip cookies and split the banana bread in 3 and put most of it in the freezer for Brian to enjoy a little at a time. Then I bagged up my food and made a resupply box to bring with me. I'm hiking the Presidential Traverse and hoping to be able to get it done in 2 days. My resupply will be stored at the AMC visitor's center in Pinkam Notch in the gear room. I'll stay there after completing the traverse and resupply myself so I'm ready for the Wildcats. 
Alligator and Eddyman are in the North Conway area and have invited us to a BBQ. It'll be great to see them and meet her fiance and his family as well as Eddyman's wife Susan. River and her friend Sarah will also be there and we're staying in North Conway for the night. Sarah will bring us to Pinkam Notch in the morning. We left the house around 2 for the drive. But the traffic was terrible as is usual thru Meredith. By the time we got to Moulton's Farm I asked Brian to please pull in. It was around 4pm. I was starving and couldn't wait for the BBQ to eat. I don't want to show up with hiker hunger and embarrass myself! So I ate a broccoli and bacon salad and some potato salad and was good for a while. We finally made it to the hotel and dropped my pack off in the room before heading to Friendlys for ice cream. Our contribution to the BBQ. We had a wonderful time seeing Alligator and Eddyman and their families. The food and company were great and it was hard to leave but it was way past hiker midnight. Brian dropped me off at the hotel and I changed and gave him my street clothes. It was a luxury wearing jeans for the day. He still had a 2 hour drive ahead of him. I'm going to miss him but I'll think of him eating chocolate chip cookies and I'll smile. River still had to pack her backpack and sort out a resupply box that she finally picked up at the Highland Center which had fallen victim to the USPS for many days and made 3 trips back to Michigan. Sarah was watching TV. I had trouble falling asleep and it was after midnight. The alarm will go off at 5am. I'm anxious about tomorrow and how my back will be. Brian was hoping I'd take a few more days to recover. I still have some pain, but sometimes movement helps and my head wants to get to Katahdin even if it drags my limp body behind it.","Home recovering

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599842,"As promised the alarm sang at 5am and I waited a few minutes then jumped in the shower. I was ready before 6am and took my pack outside the front door and waited not more than a few minutes for River and Sarah. I was running on somewhere around 4 hours of sleep. We headed off to the highly recommended Sunrise Cafe and loaded up on fuel. On the way to Pinkam Notch I drank my Starbucks frappachino and took my meds. I was officially full now. 
The parking lot at the AMC Pinkam Notch visitors center was full. Sarah dropped us off and circled back for a parking spot. River and I checked in our boxes of extra gear and food, filled our water bottles and enjoyed the convenience of modern plumbing one more time before Sarah joined us and we headed out. Sarah was going to hike the tuckerman ravine trail but it was closed with a bridge out so she joined us from 8am to 10am before turning around and heading back home. We're going to see her in a few days in Maine where she's going to be helping us out with some slack packing. The initial couple miles of trail was nice. A few wet spots, some very gentle elevation and it felt good to be back! But I know I need to be very careful with my back and really listen to it. We had to forde a brook that was deep and raging. I chose to forde because the rock hop wasn't comfortable for me. It was truly a hop and the rocks were wet and slippery. If I missed I'd be in worse condition. We sat and changed into my sandals and crossed in those. On the other side I dried my feet with my bandana and put my shoes and socks back on. It takes 10-15 minutes to do this but I feel safer being extra cautious. I want to stay out here hiking and not feel like I made a mistake coming back so soon. The elevation picked up but I was still below treeline. Then I popped out above it and  Mt Madison climb came and it was steep, open and 100% rock. I took my time and where I could have taken 1-2 steps I took 2-3 so they'd be smaller and I'd be stressing my back less. I took many extra steps. But I don't regret it. Hikers passed me but I knew I was doing the right thing. My back was still very tender. 7.4 miles in I reached the summit of Mt Madison and it was around 4pm. My back was tired and sore but I pressed on the half mile descent to the Madison hut. It was around 4:30 when I arrived and the croo was busy. I had a lemonade and paid attention to my back. I was pretty much done and thought about pushing on one more mile to Thunderstorm junction and then another mile down below treeline to camp. But as I sat there waiting for River I threw out the white flag and approached the crew regarding a work for stay. I explained that I am just coming back from an injury and I didn't feel that I could push myself any further today. Because they had already accepted a few hikers on work for stay, the decision-maker didn't look very pleased and offered us work for stay in exchange for morning chores. I wasn't thrilled because the last time I did morning chores I wasn't able to start my hike until 9: 40 in the morning. That's really late! When River walked in her face said it all. She was done for the day and accepted the work for stay with relief. As it is with work for stay we waited outside while the guests ate dinner and when they were done and disbursed we were allowed in to have cold leftovers. Tonight it was leftovers from the fridge of turkey, rice, peas and corn. There was also a bit of soup on the stove still luke warm. After dinner some of the hikers completed their agreed evening chores. Some washed dishes, some washed windows and 1 gave a talk on hiking the Appalachian Trail which was quite popular among the guests. At 9:30 we we're allowed to move the tables, sweep the floor and put our bedding down. It was not a restful night, with guests from the bunks back and forth to the bathroom all night and one guy vomiting. One of the hikers fell off the bench he was sleeping on. I still don't know who it was but there were 8-10 of us there. One hiker was actually new to backpacking and just out for a couple of days. Her equipment was heavy and she had too much. Her pack weighed over 40lbs at her estimating and she was tiny, at less than 100lbs. They let her stay and I'm confident she learned a lot about backpacking. We enjoyed talking with her.","Pinkam Notch visitors center

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599932,"I started stirring when I heard the crew in the kitchen but waited with my eyes closed for a few minutes before stretching and getting up. I packed up and some of the other hikers moved the tables back where they belonged. When the croo began setting them I grabbed a coffee a headed outside taking a seat on the bench with my puffy on and had a nice conversation with one of the guests. Just before 7am the guests disappeared into the dining room and we hikers waited outside for them to eat. Just before 8am they were done and disbursing and we went in. 
I helped myself to cold oatmeal and eggs. The bacon was gone and so was everything else. After I finished eating I asked about my chores and was told bunk rooms. I was really unhappy because I had to wait for the guests to clear out first. Meaning it would be a late start. I swept the dining room floor and River started on the bunks, checking blankets and folding as needed. I swept the bunk rooms and we left. Of all the hikers here last night I saw only 3 others do chores. None of them did morning chores. I think some just skipped out. While I'm not fond of the morning chores, I'd rather do evening chores so I can hike early, I'd never skip out. We hiked out at 8:30 not quite knowing how many miles we'd get in today. We stayed close to each other all day, carrying lighter packs with only 1 tent, 1 stove and 1 filter. The day was sunny and breezy and completely exposed. The scenery was gorgeous no matter where I  looked. It was amazing to look back from time to time and see what I'd already hiked. Because it's all exposed the perspective is so different. I can't do that on other sections.  The terrain seemed like a moon walk at times over lichen covered rocks. Miles of them. I had to always be looking at my footing and actually stop to look at the views. The trail ambled around summits not reaching all of them and I opted not to hike the extra miles to bag them. There were lots of Cairns marking the trail as well as wooden signs. Not many white blazes at all and many intersecting trails. It was confusing at times and I got off trail twice for a tenth of a mile and had to backtrack. Once was by the cog railroad. A trail went under the tracks and I followed those Cairns. It wasn't the AT but I did score some great train photos! By this time River was probably already at the summit wondering where the heck I was. I had wandered around out there for a while! I got myself corrected and saw a helicopter circling around between Mt Washington and the Lakes of the Clouds hut. I couldn't see what it was but after a couple of circles I didn't see it anymore and I was close to the summit. River found me waiting in line to take a picture at the summit sign and after that festivity it was straight for the snack bar. The chilli was delicious and I enjoyed it with a root beer and chips. It was around 2:30 and we decided that we'd do another 1.4 miles to the Lakes of the Clouds hut and see about a work for stay. They have a dungeon there which is the basement and we could stay there for $10 without any food included or chores due. So that was a possibility. On the way I told River that it was her turn to negotiate. I'd negotiated the last 2 work for stays and gotten morning chores. It's her turn to work magic with the cook of the hut who is the one who makes the decision. We arrived and River walked inside in front of me. We met Libby, AKA Gluten Puff. She was extremely kind and offered us work for stay with morning chores or $10 each in the dungeon. The dungeon was dank and moldy, so River negotiated a $10 fee to sleep on the dining room floor, no chores. We paid up and I traded in my baked good on my thru hiker pass for a bowl of soup. Another win! We were sitting at the table gloating about how great the arrangements were when Libby came over and offered us bunks. We were shocked. Someone unable to use their reservations requested that their accommodations be donated to thru hikers. This meant bunks, dinner and breakfast. And we wouldn't have to wait outside while the guests ate or until 9:30 pm to sweep the floor and put our beds down. I can't articulate how good this felt. We claimed our bunks as directed in bunk room 6. Elated, we joined the guests at 7pm for dinner. A hot dinner! Soup, salad, beef, rice, vegetables and even a GF brownie for me. All wonderful home cooked food. The crew did a little skit and the guests we joined at the table were awesome. A man on the other side of the table addressed the table asking if anyone thought there were any thru hikers there tonight. We smiled and introduced ourselves and had great conversation with him and his wife as well as 2 women from Concord NH sitting next to us. We learned that the helicopter was a DART emergency transport that landed at the hut to extract a hiker who was apparently suffering a heart issue. I noticed from the corner of my eye the work for stay hikers lurking outside. It was different being on this side of the fence. I almost felt bad was couldn't quite muster it up. After dinner and more conversation it was off to our cozy bunks. Feeling content I crawled in with my own pillow and quilt. I've cleaned bunks twice now and I know they don't wash the pillow cases or wool blankets. So no thanks on those! Thankful for the bed and lack of snoring bunk mates in this 15 bed room I plugged my phone into my charger and drifted off after saying goodnight to Brian. Life is great and my back is holding up well despite the terrain.","Madison hut

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599936,"Well that was a great sleep! I woke up once to use the restroom but was otherwise comfortable and well rested. I woke up at 6:30 to the hut croo serenading us with a guitar and singing Country Roads. I love this croo! Breakfast will be served at 7am. I was up, dressed and at the table right on time. I noticed again the bobbing hiker heads outside the windows. Nope, still not feeling badly! 
Breakfast was scrambled eggs, a GF muffin for me, oatmeal, sausage, juice, coffee, etc. Yummy! I filled up and River and I departed at 7:45. We had planned 2 days for the traverse but I'm certainly happy that we took the 3 and really enjoyed it. I'm so thankful that the people who couldn't make it to the hut asked that their accommodations be donated to us. How extremely thoughtful. I'm very blessed to have been the recipient of their generosity. Thank you, whoever you are!Today would be a longer day for me. When we reach Mizpah hut I will hike down the Webster Cliffs Trail for an 11 mile day to complete the piece I missed on Tuesday when Brian picked me up. River will take the Crawford Path to the Highland Center and the shuttle to Joe Dodge lodge where we have bunks reserved. From Lakes of the Clouds hut the trail was actually quite nice. Less rocky and still an amazing view everywhere. I kept looking back at Mt Washington and some of the others I'd climbed over. I'm amazed at myself sometimes. Seriously. I'm so pleased with my recovery also but I'm still tender and careful, trying to use my legs and not my back. River took my food bag for me to lighten my load. After soup at Mizpah hut and full water bottles I headed down to what I thought was the trail. I found myself at the campsite attached to the hut and turned around. I wandered down another trail but it didn't look right either so the campsite caretaker came over and set me down the right path. I must say that parts of NH are not blazed and there are many intersecting trails and wooden signs that are often hard to read. It's disappointing sometimes. While today's trail so far was fairly easy that was all changing. Webster Cliffs were miserable and steep rocks slabs and steep steps and roots. Ugh! I wished I was climbing this and not descending and I had 6 miles of it to go. I tried to distract myself by thinking about food rewards, shower and a bed at the end. I settled my thoughts on cold beer. Ice cold beer! I saw very few hikers. Food truck and an older hiker were visible down below me for several miles as we eached picked the best ways to personally navigate each rock slab and crevasse. There are generally 2 ways to navigate some of this stuff. The ""sit and slide"" or the ""slip and fall"". I choose the latter. Now, mind you I don't care who sees me either. If a good butt slide is my safest way to the next rock or root foothold then that's my choice. The older man down below me went down backwards a lot and marveled at the fact I could use my butt like a toboggan. Now, I may or may not have worn out the seat of my new comfy mesh boxers. But I did have a great conversation with flip a flopper Mrs T about a good butt slide. We agreed that if men want us to continue to wear there undies they should consider how rugged we can be, and perhaps stich some burlap or even leather into the seat!I tried really hard to make it to route 302 in time to hitch to the Highland Center where I could catch the 4pm shuttle to Joe Dodge lodge. It was 3:20 when I reached the road and tried hitching for 10 minutes. Not many people passed in my direction but there was a lot of traffic the other way, toward Pinkam Notch which is where I needed to go. I crossed the street and saw food truck and the older man sitting on their packs in the parking lot. I asked if they had a plan and they didn't seem to and the older man was very snappy with me so I told them I was going to see if I could hitch the 45 minute ride to Pinkam Notch. He suggested I call for a ride however there's no cell service here which clearly he didn't know until I asked if he had service. I walked out to the road and stuck out my thumb. The first car pulled over. AMC on the door and 3 dirty trail maintainers inside headed to Joe Dodge. I'm in! 45 minutes later I was picking up my room key dreaming of a hot shower and a beer. River was all checked in and showered when I arrived. She directed me to a veggie tray and coffee in the community room on the 1st floor where we hung out before dinner. At 6:30 the dinner bell rang and we were were the 1st ones there. Then I was quickly deflated. No beer. Seriously? Joe Dodge lodge is located inside the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) and therefore can't serve alcohol. Ugh! River worked her charm and within minutes the 2 women across the dining room were sharing a bottle of wine they'd brought in with us. Pinot isn't my first choice but it was tonight! We ate, has dessert and then ate again. But in a room with thru hikers there's no need to explain. When I got up to head back to the room I noticed my legs are sore. Really sore. I'm hoping they feel better in the morning. I washed my shirt and boxers in the shower earlier so we put the fan in the window and hung the wet items in front of it to dry overnight. Wet hikers smell way worse than dry hikers. Just remember that when you see one hitching and be prepared if you give them a ride. I plugged in my electronics and snuggled into my bunk. There are 4 bunks in this room and we expected at least one more hiker but so far it's just us two. Tomorrow morning I'll check my box back into storage here and we'll walk across the street to start the Wildcats. I've heard it's difficult. I think I'm ready.","Lakes of the Clouds hut
",Route 302 Crawford notch and Pinkam Notch,"Aug 07, Tue",11.10
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600277,"We were up at 5:30, showered and in the dining room right after I checked my box at 6:30. I feasted in eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and oatmeal. I hydrated with water, juice and coffee. We were crossing street to the trail just after 7am and I was packing such a full stomach I was already having breakfast remorse. Feeling bloated I was more interested in crawling back into my bunk but that wasn't the plan today. The  first mile or so was pleasant, along a pond and some large boulders. And then my world went straight up! The trail maintainers who gave me the ride to Joe Dodge yesterday told me the 1st half mile was straight up and the rest was not as bad. River went 1st and we climbed hand over, stowing or holding our poles as they were little use. I reminded myself to lean forward as I went. I don't know how far up I was when I heard the crashing of poles behind me, but I looked down and saw a man sitting with poles in both hands. ""I'm okay"" I heard, and I confirmed twice. I never saw him again all day so I assumed he aborted his mission. That climb was 3 miles and I can't convince myself that any of it was less technical or difficult. I convinced myself that when I got to the top where the Wildcat gondola is that there would be a snack bar. I'd have ice cream and take a break. Because after all, why would people ride a gondola if they couldn't eat at the top? When I arrived I was as deflated as yesterday when I couldn't have a beer. Nothing is at the top of the Wildcat gondola. Nothing. We forged on and I dreamed of how nice it would have been to coordinate with someone who could have brought food up to us. It wasn't long however before my thoughts returned to the hard work in front of me. We summited 7 peaks over 13 miles. I was soaked in sweat all day without any dry spot on my shirt even. Just drenched. I've never sweat so much in my life or thought I could. I continued to drink water and electrolytes and we stopped at the Carter hut about 6 miles in for a hot bowl of soup and break. We met another flip flop hiker who we'd originally met at the flip flop festival in Harper's Ferry and run into at Madison hut as well. She admitted to cheating and riding the gondola up, skipping 3 very hard miles. Disturbing to me. The privilege of being know as a thru hiker is on the honor system. I wondered how many other sections she skipped.I had a bowl of potato dill soup and some cold oatmeal left over from breakfast which I poured maple syrup and milk over. I questioned myself eating that because it's been sitting there all day but I was so hungry. Two other hikers came in, also flip floppers but they were no SOBO from Katahdin heading back to Harper's Ferry and they've already done the southern half. The female flip flopper left before us but we caught up to her on one of the summits and passed her while she was on the phone. At 5pm I was beginning to feel pretty spent. I'd hiked down Webster Cliffs yesterday to complete that section because I'd missed it when I went home to deal with my back and River had hiked it alone. So I'd had a long steep day yesterday and today was scheduled for 13 miles which included a stretch of 6 of the hardest miles on the trail. I felt like my legs were going to leave me. As if I'd been roughed up at the gym by Hulk Hogan and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Seriously, I wondered how I'd even sit on a toilet without falling.   And then I saw the nicest little stealth camping spot but it was occupied by the female flip flopper who cheated by riding the gondola and who I'd passed on a summit a few miles back. And she was all set up and happy resting. Hmm. I asked River if perhaps she'd sped ahead of my while I was watering some moss.  But it seems that with so many intersecting trails there's more than one way to cheat. I wonder if she'll summit Katahdin tomorrow. I'm not a cheater and this is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and I still wouldn't think of skipping a white blaze. River on the other hand is known as a brown blazer or privy blazer because she still carries a trowel she's never used! She makes it to every privy and there's no crime in that because she connects all the white blazes. Both of us are upset with the other hikers cheating but the words ""hike your own hike"" mean mind your own business. So I'll get off the soap box now. By 6pm it started raining. My favorite while scaling large slippery rock slabs. An hour later after several slip and falls by both of us I lost it. Hungry, thirsty and with my mind and body tapped out I'd had enough and I vented and cried. This terrain is downright ridiculous on a good day, never mind now.  I'd let myself become depleted and I really should have told River a while ago that I didn't think I could go further. But I didn't want to disappoint her.  I cried, cussed and we then had a discussion about it. I need to be sure in the future I speak for myself. I tend to see things sometimes as all or nothing when in reality it isn't that way. I could have camped and River could have camped too or continued to the shelter alone. But I didn't speak up. We botg fell a few times after that discussion. Eventually at 8pm, soaked and muddy and after nearly 13 hours of stenuous hiking we arrived at IMP shelter and checked in with Olivia the caretaker. There were 2 hikers in the shelter, a SOBO and a man just out for 2 days. We got set up and 4 more thru hikers NOBO from GA arrived exhausted and having done the same 13 miles fresh off a zero. We all agreed on the difficulty and none of us could understand how some people slack pack that as a 21 mile day in 12-14 hours. I made dinner and couldn't finish it. I'd have to pack out the rest. Exhausted I brushed my teeth and River stowed our food bags in the bear box. I layed down to sleep and tried to quiet my restless legs and feet. Tomorrow we have 8 miles and I heard the last 4 are easy. Then we'll get a ride to pick up our boxes at Pinkam Notch and to our hotel in Gorham. I need a hot shower, clean clothes and 2 beers! The man next to me is snoring. I hope tired enough to fall asleep.","Pinkam Notch
",IMP shelter,"Aug 08, Wed",13.10
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600279,"The entire shelter slept in until 8am. This never happens! We were all so exhausted from that 13 miles. It was 9:20 when I left the shelter after packing up and having breakfast. Wearing my wet clothes from yesterday I set out in front of River. The rain was falling lightly as I began climbing Mt Moriah. A steep rocky ascent with giant rock slabs for scaling. After a few false summits and 1.5 miles of climbingI finally reached the top. Just me in the fog and drizzle, an anticlimactic summit. I was looking forward to some easier trail this morning because I'd heard it was, but so far I haven't found it. I descended a long 4 miles landing at the Rattle River Shelter where the gondola riding section skipping hiker was sitting. She'd passed us this morning before we'd even left the shelter. I dropped my pack and exchanged some quick and cordial conversation before making off to the privy as River passed by. The trail turned flat and smooth after the shelter, a literal bed of gravel and pine needles for about 3 miles to route 2 in Gorham. As River says I ""floated"" by her and the other hiker. I was ecstatic about being able to just hike, just walk without stones, boulders and routes. I averaged almost 3 MPH to the parking lot. Done! It was around 3pm. River had messaged our trail angel Janet on the tracker earlier to give her our pick up time because there was no cell service. When River popped out into the lot we waited about 15 minutes before she arrived. Enough time to get a little dryer now that the sun had appeared and to change into camp shoes so we wouldn't get Janet's vehicle all muddy. It's bad enough that we stink. Seriously, wet hiker stinks more than dry hiker and we've been wet for 2 days. A large SUV pulled in just before Janet and the 2 women came over to ask us if we were thru hikers. We had a nice conversation before posing for pictures and then loading our packs in Janet's truck. I was glad they were riding in the back so she wouldn't smell them! Janet is our trail angel arranged by my friend Beth R. I'm extremely grateful for all the support of friends and family who help with these things. Something as simple as a ride can make a difference that is indescribable. Janet drove us to Pinkam Notch to the AMC welcome center for our gear boxes. When we got out of the truck some folks we'd seen at the Carter hut yesterday when we stopped for soup stopped and talked to us about our thru hike. No paparazzi this time just chatting. Janet was super patient. We grabbed our gear and drank a Body Armor hydration drink and ate bags of chips before getting back in the truck. Just a little refreshment! Then Janet drove us to Gorham to our motel and made arrangements to pick us up in the morning and bring us back to the trailhead. We thanked her and headed into the lobby. It was so cold in the lobby that I left River in there alone and dashed back outside to pretend to watch our gear. I say pretend because seriously not many people would want a wet and stinky 35lb backpack! River got us checked in while I spied the ice cream shop right across the street. But 1st thing is first...a shower. I jumped at the shower ahead of River and while drying off I heard commotion in the room. I dressed in my husband's base layer leggings and my mid weight wool top and went out to see Sarah there! She'd come as a surprise and brought River her new boots and hiking kilt. Awesome! While River showered we grabbed some ice cream and once that was gone Sarah drove me to the laundromat and to Walmart where she waited outside both times, I'm certain because I was out in my husband's underwear! But I had nothing else clean to wear and I'd been to Walmart before. Just saying, I don't think people noticed. With clean clothes we dressed and headed to the wood fired pizza place where for the first time ever I ate an entire pizza and I'm not talking personal size. I washed it down with beer and water. It was late, after 8pm so Sarah is going to spend the night and bring us to the trailhead in the morning. I texted Janet to let her know she can sleep in. I know I just ate dinner, but I'm already thinking about 6am breakfast at Welsh's.","IMP shelter
",Gorham,"Aug 09, Thu",8
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600455,"It was lights out around 11pm last night, late but early for River when we're in town. 5 am came and unfortunately there was no hot water to shower with so I washed up and put on my clean hiking clothes and we headed out to breakfast for their 6am opening. I had a delicious omelet with hash and cheddar cheese, home fries and coffee. I hydrated with water and sucked down a bottle of Starbucks frappachino in the car on the way to the trail head. We'll rested and ready for another day. For the first time I really enjoyed the road walk. Its 7am early morning quiet and my feet don't hurt like they used to. I don't even have to take my shoes off when I take breaks anymore, not that I've taken any significant breaks recently. It takes 11-13 hours of grinding hiking in this area to get 10-13 miles behind me. My shins bump against boulders constantly and suffer scrapes and bruises from rock scrambles. I look like I've been in some kind of wreck from my knees to my ankles. But I'm well and strong and those will heal. I'm still thankful for God keeping me safe with each trip or slip and fall. With as many steps on uneven and/or wet surface as I take in any single day it's inevitable that I'll fall regardless how cautious I am. I've seen less fortunate hikers and I pray for their healing. 
After a little over a mile of road walk the trail took me to the woods and a 2.5 mile ascent of Mt Hayes. On the way up I met 3 hikers. 2 women hiking together, an AMC volunteer named Sarah and her friend Bagels. The 3rd hiker was a woman named Which Way, a veteran trail maintainer of 27 years in the 100 mile wilderness. I had brief conversation with all of them and discovered we're all on the same schedule for this section. I'll see them all at the Gentian pond shelter later and it gave me something to look forward to. All day we played leap frog with Which Way and had lunch with her at Trident Cool Campsite which was a bit off the trail but she needed water and there weren't many options today. River and I left ahead of her and stopped a half mile ahead at a nice stream for water. Because we're still hiking with less gear we have one filter, one tent and one cook set and I need River for my water. But once I filled up there I was good for the next 5 miles to the shelter and hiked on ahead. River stayed behind hiking for a while with Which Way. I put on my music and made the rest of the day feel less difficult. It's a great little pick me up that I've learned to use to change my mood if needed. I passed Dream Lake and skipped the side trail to it then came to Upper Gentian pond and finally Gentian pond and the shelter. It was a really nice newer shelter with a loft and there was only 1 hiker there when I arrived. Gray, who I'd met at IMP shelter when he and 3 others arrived after us in the dark and rain. Gray way waiting for the rest of his tramily to arrive and I was waiting for River. But while I was waiting I was captivated by the view from the shelter. Really beautiful. It's seldom that we have something like that at a shelter and I was in full appreciation of it. River and Which Way arrived shortly after and we adopted the loft for the night since there was a nice step up and a commanding look at the view. Bagels and Sarah arrived and set up their tent and other hikers arrived including Little Horse, a German man who doesn't speak a lot of English and the rest of Gray's tramily Wallaby, Road Kill and one other. We all cooked dinner and settled in early. From the loft I enjoyed the colorful night sky and watched it fade. The shelter was quiet with all 8 hikers doing the same. River set her alarm for 5am. I closed my eyes. I was very comfortable though my back was still feeling a bit overworked and vulnerable.","Gorham
",Gentian pond shelter,"Aug 10, Fri",11.80
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600460,"I heard the alarm and River turned it off. O chose to ignore it for about 15 minutes before taking in some yoga stretching. Which Way was already up and sitting at the shelter opening enjoying the morning view and coffee. The rest of the shelter was still and quiet. As stealthily as I could I dressed and packed up my bedding then headed down so I could retrieve our bear bags from the box and get my breakfast going. River boiled water and I had oatmeal before packing up by backpack. At 6:25 I headed out. Which Way had left a few minutes before me. 
Without even a warm-up the climb came for Mt Success. Ironically it's the last mountain in NH. When I finally caught up with Which Way, which I thought would never happen, I commented on how she must have had her Wheaties today. She's such an incredible hiker that it makes me feel much older than I am! I don't think I'll be hiking the AT at 71 but it would be nice to know I could! When I reached the Maine border I sent a Marco Polo video to Brian but there wasn't enough service so it will be delivered when I have better service or WiFi. River arrived while I was there and let me know she saw Which Way stopped at Carlo Cool shelter for water. River filtered water for me up trail a bit and I hiked on. I hadn't seen Bagels and Sarah all day but Gray, Wallaby and a couple of other hikers did pass me. Though today was still a tough hike it was less technical and my mind was therefore free to wander and it wandered all over my family and friends and how blessed I am to have Brian and his love and support. I haven't taken the time from the strenuous hiking these past days to enjoy anything other than the views. But today I stopped at the blueberries, eating and savoring all I could find and letting the flavor linger on my tongue while thinking about Brian. Blueberries are his favorite. I thought about all we've experienced together and the future experiences I'm looking forward to. Like being a ""Funma"" to Jeff and Victoria's first child expected in February. I'm excited about that for them and for us and I wish they didn't live so far away. It made climbing up the 3 Goose Eye peaks more bearable because they just didn't seem to want to end. When I arrived at the shelter at 3:15 Gray was napping in it. I sat quietly in the long structure and ate voraciously from my snack bag which I had neglected in lieu of the blueberries. About an hour later River arrived and behind her Which Way. Sarah and Bagels flowed in sometime after as did some section hikers out trying to do 26 miles in 2 days. Gray's tramily caught up and they left at 4:30-5pm to do the Mahoosuc Notch and camp on the other side of it. The group of young section hikers were going to try to get to Carlo Col shelter another 4.4 miles away but after talking with us and understanding they would not make it before dark they decided to stay the night here. They were not going to be able to make the 26 miles in 2 days. The terrain is too difficult. Which Way was able to help them with her map and gave them an alternate route for tomorrow where they could get to a trail head parking lot and hitchhike to where they left the car they thought they'd hike out to. During dinner we all agreed on a 4:30 wake up. River, Which Way, Bagels, Sarah and I will do the Mahoosuc Notch together making it fun and helping each other. The section hikers would head south on their alternate route. The German hiker is here tonight also as well as some tenters and a hamoker. Because of the bold and brazen deer mice inhabitants of this shelter Which Way has decided to tent. She couldn't stand the thought of a repeat experience of a mouse in her hair. She didn't bring her rainfly but found a tarp she could fashion up and made herself a fine tentsite where she'll sleep in peace. Me on the other hand I'm not sure. While the rest of the group cooked on the rocks across from the shelter the German hiker cooked in the shelter and the brazen beady eyed mice seem fond of his end of it. I'm far away and thankful for the unusual length of this shelter. But as I lay here watching the sun tint the sky I'm also watching to see if those little buggers come my way. I'm not above using my hiking poles as skewers. I'm sleeping better in shelters these days and I hope tonight is just as good because 4:30 will still be dark. Tomorrow in new light and hopefully dry weather we'll be 5 women strong conquering the most difficult section of the Appalachian Trail together. Team Mahoosuc!","Gentian pond shelter
",Full Goose shelter,"Aug 11, Sat",9.60
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600468,"It was my bladder and not mice that woke me at 1:50am. I layed on my stomach looking out of the shelter and thought about getting up to relieve it and where I'd go but ultimately decided I'd rather will the urge away and get 2 more hours of sleep and so I did. At 4:30 two musical alarms woke the shelter, all but the German hiker who must have kept the mice entertained last night because I never saw or heard one once my head hit the pillow. 
I did my yoga stretching and packed up my sleeping stuff. River boiled water and I had oatmeal and the Chai Mate tea I've been holding onto since the Yellow Deli. It's Brazilian tea for energy and I'm hoping it's my lucky charm today. I walked down to Which Way's tent at 5 to be sure she was up and she was. Bagels and Sarah arrived for breakfast shortly after, all packed up. By the time River was ready and we left camp it was 6:17am. All of us light on water and with everything stowed inside our packs we headed down 1 mile into the famed most difficult mile on the trail, the Mahoosuc Notch. The descent was real and a reminder of what we might see on the other side at the ascent of the Mahoosuc Arm. When we reached the bottom we stowed our trekking poles and forged ahead as a team. We worked as a team trying to solve the puzzle of getting thru this mile. Over, under and around boulders the size of small homes with very few blazes or arrows. We passed backpacks, spotted each other, pushing or pulling each other as needed to assist and even unstuck a boot wedged in rocks. In 2 hours and 20 minutes we arrived at the other end with just a couple of scrapes and a profound feeling of teamwork and accomplishment. Team Mahoosuc! We regrouped, filtered water, ate snacks and headed up the Mahoosuc Arm once again helping and directing each other as needed over the ledges and granite inclines of the extremely steep Arm for yet another mile. As we hiked I noticed that Sarah makes a lot of little noises when hiking. She's got one when she boosts herself up, one when she slips, one when she sees something, etc. I've named her Sound Effects, which she gladly adopted. When we reached the top bathed in sweat we sat and had lunch together. Again feeling accomplished and proud. When we departed the top of the Arm I hiked ahead and spent most of the rest of the day in front a little so I could enjoy some quiet time and reflection. At Speck Pond I stopped for a minute to look. Though I couldn't see much because of the dense fog and mist I still took a moment. When I resumed walking my left boot toe caught a rock and I tripped falling hard on my left side and smashing my right shin on the rocks. I crawled up on my hands and knees and got myself up with my pack on. I looked at the scrape and blood on my shin and although it hurt like hell I was really grateful it wasn't my face. I studied the scene of the crime for a minute and hiked on. Being thankful to God that I wasn't injured but the bruises and scrapes. I ascended Old Speck Mountain which quite honestly is the first one to scare me. Increadibly steep granite slabs with nothing to hold onto and steep drop offs. I was thankful that the rest of my group was not far behind and at times could see me on the exposure above them. Socked in the fog and drizzle I couldn't see anything beyond my immediate surroundings. When I reached the top of the trail at the junction of a .3 blue blaze trail to the summit I stopped to feed the beast. My growling stomach which reminds me every 2 hours at least that it's there. Sound Effects and Bagels caught up with me and took the blue blaze trail to bag the peak while I waited a little longer for River and Which Way. I got chilled and had to hike ahead not waiting for them so I could stay warm. With 3.5 left to go I was ready to see the parking area and River's friend Sara (I've been spelling her name wrong) and Stripper who Sara rescued a couple of days ago after she took a fall. They're giving me a ride into Bethel and I'll be taking double zeros to rest up from the past 8 days of tough hiking and very long days. Brian will come up tomorrow and spend a night with me. I'm looking forward to it! The 3.5 mile descent took forever and I took my time because my body is tired and I was thinking River and Which Way or Sound Effects and Bagels would catch up. They never did. A half mile from the parking lot I took another fall, this time onto my pack and smashing the back of my left hand onto the rocks behind me cutting my hand, my pack saving my head. Thank you again God. I got up and moved down the trail another 10th of a mile to a small stream and washed the blood off my hand and trekking pole. I wrapped my hand up in my cold wet bandana and finished the descent to the parking lot thinking about my upcoming 2 days off and how much my body needs it.  Sara and Stripper greeted me at 5:15 with chips and a Body Armor hydration drink. I sat down and indulged and as the others made their way down we cheered for them. It's be been another long hiking day but the reward of friendship and teamwork has been so great. On that long climb up Old Speck and that lengthy descent I thought about how wonderful River was to stay behind and wait for Which Way and hike the duration with her. I thought about the trail karma necklace I wear, given to me by the ATC for choosing a flip flop hike considered healthy for the trail. I can keep this necklace or I can give it to someone who I see providing karma to the trail. I decided on that descent that Which Way for her 27 years as a steward and maintainer of the trail and for still being out here hiking and helping hikers deserves this necklace far more than me and it would make me so happy to give it to her. So after our break in the parking lot I asked her if she'd ever seen the necklace I wear and what it is. She hadn't. So I told her about it and that although it's bathed in my sweat I was presenting it to her.  I'm amazed by her. I'm blessed to know her and her family and friends are blessed to have her. I can't wait to get to the 100 mile wilderness and see her work in front of me. And to get the recipe for the trail bars she makes so my beast won't growl so soon after morning oatmeal! We parted ways with Which Way, Sound Effects and Bagels but will share pics and emails. River, Sara, Stripper and I headed off to Belfast to get me check in to my accommodation and then enjoyed dinner at the brewery. I was back at my room by 9pm with a full belly and a full heart. I love my life, I love my hike, I love my trail friends and I love the man I'm going to see tomorrow. I'm looking forward to 2 rest days and it will give all of me what is needed to get me thru the next difficult 8-10 days. It's 11pm and I don't know why but I turned on the TV and there are still 100 channels of ""nothing"" on. I don't miss it!","Full Goose shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600545,"I slept very well but woke up automatically around 5:30 and refused to get up. I faded in and out of consciousness until 7 when I agreed to get up, shower and find something to feed the beast. Having negotiated a hiker rate here breakfast was not included. I looked at Google maps on my phone and discovered a potential breakfast just .3 down the street and headed out. Score! An adorable Cafe with outdoor seating. I devoured a GF bagel, hard boiled egg, fruit cup and coffee. I lingered a while before making my way diagonally across the street to the grocery store where I bought an iced tea, banana and raspberries. At almost 10 I was back at the Inn where I packed up my bag and assorted box and pie and asked the owner if I could hang out somewhere until Brian arrived. She directed me to the very comfortable farmer's porch where I took a seat on a wicker sofa and enjoyed my fruit and tea. The housekeeper came out and we had a nice conversation before Brian finally arrived at 11: 15. It was so good to see him and he came up onto the porch met the owner and loaded by things in the truck.
We spent the rest of the afternoon doing laundry and taking a trip to Lewiston to get me another pair of shoes. I know, I must eat shoes because I've had so many pair! Truth be told the Rock's have eaten my Hokas, the tread is worn and the sides are tearing from the abrasion of these nasty rocks. I scored a new pair of Hoka hiking mids. They're more stable and I should get more mileage out of them. But the price tag was alarming! I asked for a discount and he took off $10 but upsold me on a $6 can of water proofing, so I'm hardly ahead. after that we were turn to Belfast and checked into the B & B that Brian had reserved for us, a lovely place! We settled in and strolled down the street to a restaurant of the innkeeper's suggestion. We were both ready for an early dinner and we shared a bottle of wine. It was fantastic having a date with my husband!After breakfast the following morning which was absolutely delicious and some great conversation with the innkeeper's, we organized my bag and got me ready for the hostel where he'd be dropping me later. It was pouring rain and I was so thankful to be taking another day off. I can already feel the rest is doing my body good. We said goodbye and headed to the grocery store to replace my Smart water bottles. With the last of the chores done we headed out to the movies. Another date with my hubby! I chomped on popcorn with extra butter and sipped his root beer. After the movie he delivered me and my gear to the Pine Ellis hiker hostel where we packed up one more box to send further up the trail to Monson. Stripper and Sara will pick it up tomorrow when they drop River off. Brian dropped me at the store so I could get dinner from their counter and he could head home. I ate a nice salad and some fries and walked back to the hostel where I settled in as the only female in room 2 with 5 beds. It was very quiet but also very warm and small. I journaled for a while and then went downstairs to brush and use the potty before retiring to my bed again for sleep. My shuttle leaves at 7am tomorrow and I'll slack pack a 10 mile day. It's almost 11pm and I need sleep!","

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600624,"I slept okay in the bunk room. No one snored and I was under an open window so I had fresh air. Around 5 the man next to me left. The German hiker and the younger hiker were still sleeping when I got up just before 6. I packed up as quietly as I could and got my day pack ready taking it with me and leaving the rest of my stuff on my bed. The housekeeper Naomi said she'd move it into the private room River and I will be sharing for the next 3 nights. 
I made my oatmeal in the kitchen and washed it down with a cup of coffee.  Just before 7 my shuttle driver Gloria said she was ready when I was and off we went. I was at the trail head at 7:25 and I used the toilet before crossing route 26 and heading north. It was a morning climb for sure with a 3 mile rocky ascent up to the West Baldpate peak. Giant, wet rock slabs were on the menu and they were super slick. I have my new Hoka mids on but it's day one with them and thus we're still in the ""courting"" phase. I haven't built a trusting relationship with them yet and I don't have ""tread confidence"". In other words I'm not sure how well I'll stick to these slanted slabs and so I'm more cautious today. I played leap frog with Moses, Dimples and the rest of their group, all of us not trusting the rocks. Dimples fell in front of me and turned to let me know of a really slick one. Honestly I'm super tired emotionally because of these damn rocks. It's a drain to be constantly on guard for your life! I reached the rocky top in the clouds and stopped to pick and enjoy some wild blueberries. While I was doing so the breeze blew away the clouds and I was then able to see Moses, Dimples and the others climbing up the Baldpate East peak and that was very cool. I watched them navigate the rock and headed in that direction. It was an easy and fun summit despite the rocks. But the descent was everything but. More giant wet rock slabs. Yippie. At least I was in good company because I wasn't the only one taking it very slowly. Moses and his group are nobo from GA and they were very slowly descending over these slippery slabs also. In one area a rope assist was helpful to have. River is out here today too but I haven't seen her and I'm sure she started after me. I reached the Frye Notch shelter and stopped for a lunch of summer sausage and potato sticks. Moses thought he heard thunder but I wasn't convinced and the sky didn't look dark so I headed up towards the peak where I was to call the hostel and confirm my pick up time. Halfway up the hill the thunderstorm was undeniable. I stashed my phone in a Ziploc in my bag and found a log to sit on. I folded myself so I was resting on my thighs with my head above my knees and my day bag below them. And I prayed for God to keep me safe as the rain pounded my back and the thunder clapped above my head. When the rain had almost stopped I resumed hiking, thanking God for keeping me safe. I would dry off at the hostel if o didn't walk myself dry before then. At the top of the hill I confirmed my pick up in 2.5 hrs. I completed the hike without incident but skipped a side trail to the falls. I was so tired! David the shuttle driver was waiting for me at the road and brought me back to the hostel. It was just before 4 and I took a shower and hung my clothes out on the line out back. It's convenient being able to walk to the store and restaurant so I wandered over and had a salad and chill. The service is incredibly slow but the food is good. I carried out an ice cream and finished it on the porch at the hostel while visiting with a couple of other hikers. River had arrived and was at the store getting her dinner. We signed up for the shuttle tomorrow for another 10 mile slack pack and retired to our room. I journaled for a while and River watched TV. It was just after 8:30 when I said goodnight to Brian. The shuttle leaves at 8am so I am thinking about going to the store for breakfast in the morning.","Route 26

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600691,"I slept from 8:30 or so until 6:35. I was exhausted. I never even heard the thunderstorm or River get up and go downstairs to move our shoes back from the edge of the porch. I made oatmeal and ate on the porch with coffee before we were shuttled out at 8am to South Arm Rd. The 10+ mile section we hiked today over Moody mountain and Sawyer notch we did sobo because it was a less difficult hike in that direction. I'd like to say it was easier but there's nothing easy about this area. 
We saw Moses and Dimples again and a few other hikers but there didn't seem to be many people out today. By Sawyer brook we met a young man hiking with his dog. The man is deaf but we were able to have a conversation because he can read lips. I filtered water for him because he was frustrated with his Sawyer mini and 16 oz bag. He had another Sawyer before but it broke and this was all Walmart had. Supply options are almost non existent in this area. His dog was adorable but young and afraid of people, so there was no exchange with the little cutie. The Hall Mt shelter was right on trail so we stopped there for lunch and I finished my summer sausage and potato sticks and enjoyed the company of a day hiker and 2 thru hikers. From the shelter it was up to the summit of Wyman Mt and down to surplus pond. The deaf man and his dog were there and he was smoking a cigarette. I had to pee so I hiked up the hill a few tenths of a mile and ducked behind a huge boulder and River hiked ahead. I saw him coming and I shouted ""STOP"" with my hand in the universal stop position. But of course he didn't hear me so when he saw my hand up he waived and continued walking towards me. But as he got to me he realized that I was peeing and put his hand up to the side of his eye like a blinder. Wearing a skirt, I was not exposed. But I really prefer not getting caught with my boxers down! River said she knew I'd been caught when he hiked up behind her. The last 4 miles were less difficult. We finished our hike and were shuttled back to the hostel by 4:15. The shuttle driver had cold lemonade for us and it was very refreshing! We showered and made our way to the Red Hen for AYCE Mexican food. I had a full plate and a beer and then went next door for a strawberry sundae. It was delicious! Then I walked back to the hostel and up to my room to journal and sleep. River watched TV and about 9pm I rolled over and closed my eyes. I hope I sleep as well as last night. I'm very tired from the hike today.","East B Hill Rd

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601064,"I was up at 5:30 and walked over to Mills store at 6 am for breakfast. I enjoyed some excellent home fries with onions and a ham and cheddar omelet with coffee and a strawberry milk. Over my right shoulder in the middle of the dining area was a table filled with 6 men. Above them was a sign that said ""Liars Table"". I think these guys are regulars. The conversation was pretty funny and I enjoyed the small town vibe. I walked back to the hostel to catch the 7am shuttle. Today was a slack pack of 13 miles including Old Blue Mt. 
David the shuttle driver dropped us off at the trail head and gave us each an apple. It was a nice morning and the climb up Old Blue was actually nice. I topped Bemis Mt and stopped to eat the blueberries. Today was the first day in a long time that I could think about anything other than my feet on the trail. I thought about my life, my feelings, and about Brian. I stopped at the Bemis Mt shelter for lunch. Then I hiked up to the 2nd peak. The descent was rock a slabs and I was unhappy to see them. The rest of the terrain was mellow with small rolling ups and downs and I rolled along at a decent clip. A hiker traveling sobo and looking like Santa Claus approached and we stopped to talk. He had no pack and not even a bottle of water. His physique was not that of a hiker. He had hiked up a side trail and was covering a 1.5 mile section and had dropped his pack at the trail junction to hike the 1.5 and back. He was from Tennessee. Then he asked what I was doing and I told him I'm thru hiking on a flip flop and slack packing. He corrected me with a lecture on the origination and definition of slack packing. I found him a bit arrogant and my ears closed. Funny how that happens but I wished him a nice hike and moved on. Later River told me the opinionated Santa Claus dude was actually Warren Doyle out working on the completion of his 18th hike of the trail. She had taken a class from him on hiking the AT so I was happy for her that she was able to see and talk to him. She was really happy. At the bottom of the Long steep descent there was trail magic. We shared the last beer, a Miller High Life and ate some of the cherry tomatoes and signed the guest book. This trail magic couple even provided a hand mirror hanging on the tree. It was really cool, even if I don't like Miller beer, I did today.  The subsequent river crossing was a little tricky but I made it! When David picked us up at route 17 he had cold lemonade for us. It was really nice. Cold and delicious. David tipped us off that tonight was prime rib at the Red Hen so we asked him to drop us there. It was 6pm and we were wet with sweat and stinky. I had a glass of wine because I was chilled and didn't feel like s beer and ordered the prime rib with mashed potatoes, green beans and pickled beets. It was absolutely delicious! After dinner I walked to Kate's Kones and got a sundae and then back to the hostel. I finished my sundae and then showered and got ready for bed. The hostel is full tonight and the Overflow bunk room too. We threw our clothes in the washer but it was nearly 10:30 by the time they were dry. A late night to bed and our shuttle leaves at 6am.","South Arm Rd

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601066,"I was up early after not the greatest night of sleep, it was a wakeful one. I packed up and had my oatmeal on the porch. After saying goodbye to Naomi David drove us to Route 17 and dropped us off at the trail head with an apple. I grabbed my rain gear from my pack. It was foggy and drizzly and David was going to drop our packs in Rangeley so we are slack packing again. 
The drizzle stopped a couple of miles into the hike so I took off my rain jacket and tied it around my waist and left my rain kilt on. I didn't feel like stopping to take my pack off. Mud was the name of the game today. 13 miles of it. While the terrain was just a rocky bumpy day with no big ups and downs the mud was a constant concern and it was mentally draining navigating around it all day. At one point I thought some light colored sand was a rock and I stepped in to my ankles. It was water and mud. I didn't stop for lunch I just snacked thru it. There were very few hikers on the trail today. There were 4 ponds and some beautiful old forest but the ponds weren't all visible because of the fog. I was hoping to see a moose today. When I stopped for a snack another hiker told me he had come around a corner and spooked a calf and cow moose but they ran off. There were no views today and I felt like I was just getting the miles in.  I got to the parking lot and trail head at 3 and waited for River. While waiting I received trail magic beer and chips from a couple in the parking lot giving out trail magic to some other hikers. My first PBR and honestly, it tasted great!  Stacey from fieldstone cottages picked us up at the trailhead at 4 and drove us to Rangeley. We checked into our cabin and took showers but the hot water would last 20 seconds and then it would be ice cold. We discovered we had to turn it off and then on again and keep doing that thru the shower. It sucked. These are brand new cabins. We let the owner know and then walked to the laundromat and got our clothes clean. We saw a couple of other hikers there also. When we finished that we took our laundry bag to dinner at Parker and Main. I had a burger with fries and a beer and of course we had ice cream on the way back to the cottage. The ceiling light is on the same switch as the ceiling fan. It would have been nice to have the fan on. But I crawled into bed and River made coffee and her sofa bed. We looked at slack packing but decided to hike with full packs because slacking required extra side trail miles. We arranged a 7 am shuttle. I'll skip the hot and cold shower game in the morning!","Route 17 Oquossoc

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601105,"The cottage was comfortable but I woke around 1am in the middle of a night sweat, damn 50's, to the TV still on and River asleep with the remote under her covers. My rustling about must have woken her because she found the remote and turned it off. Around 5:30 I got up and redied myself and my pack for the day and made my last berry smoothy package for breakfast. I was ready at 6:45 and relaxed before Stacey came to check us out and bring us back to the trailhead. We checked out on her cell phone with our credit cards. It's incredible what technology has allowed us to do out here! At the trailhead Stacey helped with our packs and gave us hugs. It was warm and motherly even though she's younger than us. She drove away and we walked across the street to the trail.
The first few miles were a gradual incline and at Eddy Pond the trail changed and 2 miles of real climbing began. I sweat buckets! I was going to take a rest on the open summit of Saddleback but there were lots of day hikers and dogs, so I passed by and opted for a rest at a spot between Saddleback and the Horn where I ate the rest of the dark chocolate blueberry macadamia nuts Brian sent me and called to talk with him. I was feeling very annoyed and grumpy today but felt much better after our conversation. I hiked up the Horn where the sign was gone and took a silly picture with the remaining post. Then there was the climb up Saddleback Jr. By the time I got there I sat under the sign and snapped a selfie but couldn't muster a smile. I reminded myself to actually let me off the hook for the crappy mood. We all have those days. Sometimes I feel like a locomotive and sometimes I feel like the caboose. Today was a caboose day and it probably didn't help that I rationed my water so I wouldn't have to carry extra weight. I know it affected my hike because I could feel it in my cognitive function of my hiking, my slow reaction and choices. I was more than ready to arrive at the shelter and did so around 4:30. I thought briefly about getting in another mile but decided it wouldn't be wise, what if I didn't find a tent site, and the ease of the shelter was speaking to me. Dr Who was the only one there and I'd met him earlier in the day when he passed me. He'd just woken up from a nap and was in a happy and talkative mood which I settled into. An hour later I'd still not seen River and was becoming concerned so I texted Brian to see if he could look at her tracker and see where she was. A moment later she arrived looking just as I'd been feeling. She'd actually called her wife and asked to go home but her cat Destiny told her she couldn't come home until she finished the trail. So I guess I'm not the only one in the dumpster today. We rolled out our tyvek to claim our shelter space and chatted with a couple of hikers who stopped to have dinner then hiked on. Knots and Earth Heart arrived and also had dinner. Knots had also been in a bad mood and Dr Who confessed to hiking angry all day. All of this made me feel better. In the shelter Buddah had left a Dr Seuss book ""oh the places you'll go"" which River read out loud to the group. The book and the conversation completely changed the mood of all and we were happy to be together. Blueberry arrived and joined us. She'd hiked a 20 mile day to escape a pink blazer and was happy to spend the night with us. Knots and Earth Heart decided to stay and tent instead of hike on, feeling happy and like a small family now. After filling my belly with some Annie's GF shells and white cheddar with added bacon bits I got ready for bed and crawled in next to the memorial for Geraldine Largay (Inchworm) who spent her last night of safety at this shelter in 2013. The next day she stepped off trail and became lost. She lived 26 days but searchers could not find her. Her remains were found in 2015. I didn't know her but have hiked with and met 2 women who did. On this night I prayed for her and her family, that they are all at peace. I know tomorrow I'll hike where she did and pass by the same area where she left the trail. I'll be thinking of her. Tonight the people in this shelter have made an impact on each other and are grateful for it. We go to sleep feeling much differently than when we arrived. It's an evening I think I'll always remember fondly.","Route 4 Rangeley

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601111,"River's alarm went off at 5am but she hit snooze twice and I took advantage of it. At 5:30 I went to Knots and Earth Heart's tents to be sure they were up and they were. I made my oatmeal and packed up before grabbing my trekking poles for a .10 trek south to the privy which was thru a mud bog and most inconvenient for a nobo hiker. Blueberry watched me and thought the trekking poles were overkill but confessed to wishing she were me after her round trip to it. 
I did sleep well last night. It's amazing that I can sleep in shelters now and actually sleep...thru snoring, farting and thunderstorms. But I did dream that I came across a huge mud bog for as far as I could see on the trail. In the center was a neat clean row of stepping stones. Cool, I thought. But as I went to step on them one rock ducked under the mud and when I retracted my foot it came back up all clean like it never happened. It was as if the trail was alive and totally screwing with me. I wondered what was in store for me today. I left camp at 7, after Knots and Earth Heart and before River and Dr Who. Most of the first 3 miles were a descent. I came upon the rock slabs and navigated most successfully. I have a good relationship with my shoes now, we've passed the courting phase and I felt like we'd ""stick"" together, but we didn't and I instantly found myself in my best upside down turtle pose. I shouted "" Oh gee golly what an unfortunate incident!"" But it sounded exactly like ""F#CK!"". From my vulnerable position I noticed Dr Who standing at the top of the rock slab above me. I quickly righted myself to the sitting position and slid the remaining few feet down the rock and brushed myself off. Then I watched him with his extra long legs take a small slip but expertly navigate thru it remaining upright all the way. I let him pass by me. I could never match that stride! I walked navigating mud and roots falling again by root instead of rock and being uninjured. I was so banged up bruised and bloodied between the Wildcats and Grafton Notch that my legs could have auditioned for a victim scene on CSI. They are finally healing so I'm not embarrassed anymore and I'd like it to remain that way so some day I can shave them again. Having to do my #2 business but not wanting to leave the trail in this very dense forest with tons of undergrowth I took the opportunity to walk down an intersecting old logging road out of site of the trail but where I could easily get back to it. It was the perfect place and just before the next climb. All was successful and I returned to conquer Lone Mt. The climb honestly took me by surprise. That's happened a few times, these peaks no one talks about because they aren't 4k mountains but sometimes they're worse climbing. I drank more water today getting over having to carry it. It's too important. I stopped at Spaulding mountain shelter for lunch and met Handyman from Meredith NH and Chemist from Michigan. Ironic as I'm from NH and River is from Michigan. River arrived and we finished lunch together. I hiked out ahead for the 1 mile to the Spaulding summit and stopped at the plaque dedicated to the completion of the final section of trail connecting it on August 14, 1937. Very cool! I passed up the extra half mile to summit Sugarloaf not feeling the need to bag any peak that adds to my day but the hiking was pretty good here. I was feeling pretty relaxed and good. I texted my Mom and gave her an update on my journey and let her know I'm thinking of her and love  her. Then therere it was. I stood at the top in disbelief just looking. What would be a half mile of cliff hanging boulders and extremely steep descent to the Carrabassett River where we'd make camp. I was suddenly wishing I'd made use of the really nice stealth site I saw back a ways. I took a few minutes to absorb the idea that I am strong and I can do it. Just do it slowly. And that I did, letting other hikers pass me as they came up behind me I picked my way slowly thru, even the poorly marked areas. I made it to the safety of still steep but much smoother trail and settled into the rest of the descent, letting the stress hormones go. I very much enjoyed the conversation crossing of the Carrabassett River and found the campsite on the other side where Handyman was setting up. I grabbed a nice flat spot and set up then wandered out and hung a bear line to share with River when she arrived. I washed up at the river and felt really good being clean and refreshed. I washed out my boxers, bandana and pee rag too. All fresh and clean I decorated a bush with them to dry. When River arrived she set up near me. She was extremely frazzled having fallen off a boulder on that steep Cliff and narrowly missing an additional fall down the cliff. An extremely stressful day for her.We had dinner together and hung our Bear bags. I crawled into the sanctuary of my tent which I haven't slept in since the Monday before I went home for my back injury, below Zeland Falls hut. It was nice to be reaquainted with her! The sound of the river is bliss! I texted with my hubby and our friend Deb B. I'm amazed I have such great signal in this valley. There are 5 of us tenting here tonight. Tomorrow is a shorter 8 miles to Stratton.","Poplar Ridge shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601115,"I slept in a little, needing the rest and getting up around 6:30 when the other tenters started stirring. After packing up and getting our bear bags down I had breakfast with River on some nearby logs. Then I filtered my water and headed out around 8am for an 8 miles to Stratton where we had motel reservations. I need a 3 day resupply and to wash my stinky body and clothes. Also I need to somehow pad my shoulder straps where they hit my collarbone. I have 2 painful bumps there and I'd like to get some relief. 
The immediate hike out of Camp was a 3-mile Ascent of South Crocker with a dip and then another ascent of North Crocker. It was a steep climb but again today I drank plenty of water and I knew that I'd be getting to town so my mood was much lighter. On my way down south Crocker I met a really lovely lady named Penny out for a Day hike and we stopped and had a really pleasant conversation for several minutes. She'll be hiking in the Bigelow's this weekend and I'm not sure if I'll see her there but it would be really cool! A little further down my descent between South Crocker and North Crocker I met another lady day hiking who had come upon a bear and stopped to let me know. Wanting to make some noise as I proceeded I made a little song that went hey there, hey there if you're still there, run away, run away. And I sang the silly song out loud until I was near the bottom of the descent between mountains, a little notch or collar area. At that point a young woman was hiking southbound on the trail with a dog and when I saw her I was somewhat relieved knowing that bears don't like dogs. So I stopped and asked her if she had seen a bear down in the notch and she responded with no, but Bears don't like my dog. I smiled, Instantly relieved I proceeded without incident through the notch and started on the ascent of North Crocker. At the summit I met another hiker who had dropped his pack to scurry out to a small side trail with a view, and we chatted for a minutes until he turned to me and said, looking North to the trail, so I guess next we get a really steep descent. I Shrugged my shoulders and I said probably cuz that is what has become Maine, and I followed him down the trail to find to both of our bliss a very gentle yet muddy descent of over 6 miles all the way to the Route 27 parking lot. Relaxed and feeling great I texted River from the parking lot. She was a little over half mile out. I waited 15 minutes before calling Trout at the motel for a shuttle. Within a few minutes River was there and then Trout. Trout greeted us with Ma'am and was a little abrasive. I assumed military but waited a few to ask. Marines was the answer. We got the rundown on rules and the nickel tour of town as we drove thru, landing at the motel where 3 hikers had clearly been stranded outside for years. Carved bears. Clearly no one but hikers would stay here. We don't expect much I guess. We dropped our stuff in the screened in room that is the ""pack room"" and put on our camp shoes. The room has all we need and it's clean. The grocery store is across the street next to the restaurant and bar and the laundry is not far away. We showered and relaxed having gotten in at 3pm it's an early day. Blueberry, Knots and Earth Heart are here. Blueberry is taking a zero tomorrow because of the weather but the other 2 are heading back out to the trail this afternoon. Glider is also here and Just Mike. We haven't seen them since Harper's Ferry!!! We had a little reunion and had dinner across the street together along with a couple of others. Sara is coming tomorrow to drive us to Rangeley to the IGA and see what we can do about my pack straps too. We'll get laundry done also. We're going to take a zero because the weather calls for heavy rain and thunderstorms. We won't hike the Biggelows in that weather and we've hiked 8 days so a day off is in order. We watched Married at First Sight in our room with Blueberry and enjoyed some chips and dips from the store.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601129,"I'm so glad I didn't hike today! It wasn't raining when I woke up to hiker commotion at 6: 30. I showered and walked up to the Citgo station to get River and I each a cup of coffee. We watched the sky as it turned black and the rain came down shortly after. We ran out into the pack room to move our packs into the center of the floor away from the screens where they would be wet. When Sara arrived we drove to the Looney Moose Cafe and had a great breakfast. Then we headed back to our room to grab our laundry and left Sara to nap while we headed to the laundromat to get that chore completed. About an hour later we returned and the three of us went to Rangeley to the IGA for resupply and to see what we could come up with for my pack straps to give me and my collarbone a little cushion. Sara is a blessing. In Rangeley the IGA was able to fulfill my needs and with a couple of other stops I was able to remedy my shoulder strap collarbone issue with some $1 microfiber sponges that Trout helped me stuff into the webbing on the straps. I put all my things in my pack and walked around a few minutes to make sure it provided the relief I'm seeking. It feels good. Tomorrow will be the real test, I'll be back on trail. After a relaxed afternoon journaling and munching on fresh cherry tomatoes I declined dinner with River and Sara for some time alone. Trout made pulled pork for everyone here but I decided on a dish of coleslaw with the groupand ordered some plain wings from the Plaza across the street. I'll get a good night's rest, drink lots of water and be ready to conquer the Biggelows tomorrow. We're hoping for 10 miles and I'm feeling confident. Let's hope I don't have anymore dreams about the trail sabotaging my hike! We're hoping to stay on track for a Sept 6th summit of Katahdin.","

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601462,"Sara left at 5:30 and River and I showered and got ready for the 7am shuttle. I drank a protein shake and ate a fruit cup I'd bought at IGA yesterday. I brought an avocado and some cape cod potato chips to the shared kitchen and let Trout know when I paid my bill and stamped my passport. River and I were loaded in the suburban at 7 and Trout went to get Dr Who, but he wanted a 7:30 shuttle so we told Trout we could wait until 7:30 so he didn't have to drive twice. While we waited we shared a cup of coffee. 
At 7:30 we loaded into the suburban along with Gray Squirrel and Dr Who wasn't there. Trout was very irritated that he was a minute late. So much so that his attitude reflected it on the drive and he passed a vehicle on a solid yellow line. I get that he was upset but that gives him no right to drive that way risking everyone in the vehicle. From the corner of my eye I saw Dr Who put his seat belt on. So I know I wasn't the only one feeling unsafe. I departed the trail head at 7:45 and hiked the first two miles in an hour. Then the terrain changed and I climbed for hours over rocks, roots and mud in often steep sections. I summited the Biggelow South, North, West and Avery peaks. All with great views and some open rocky summits where the wind blew me sideways a bit. I didn't spend much time up there, just a quick photo so I could hurry down below treeline. The weather was amazing. Sunny and comfortable with beautiful blue skies. We stopped at a day use lien to for lunch and I ate my avocado and some potato sticks. Dr Who was there and Gray Squirrel arrived before I left. River left ahead of me as I went off to find the privy. It was beautiful and new and it reminded me of the privies in CT! I didn't see many thru hikers today but there was a large group of young section hikers and I suspected they were headed for the same campsite we were so I mentioned that we should make sure to stay ahead of them. The site we were headed to has 6 sites and 2 tent platforms. Just before the tentsite I went through a very cool field of glacial boulders. I took a video and sent a Marco Polo for Brian and Kyle. I was the only one at the campsite when I arrived and I saw a pretty new tent platform that I went to and sat on, taking my pack off. Within 5 minutes a group of 9 arrived and asked me questions about the site. The only thing I could offer was the description on Guthooks and the signs at the site pointing to water, privy and sites. I hadn't even explored yet. Then another large group arrived, closer to a dozen. I made a box of au gratin potatoes which took a long time to rehydrate and set them aside in my cozy while i set up my tent. The large groups lingered near the fire pit and went for water. Then River finally arrived and followed the group of 9 out towards the 2nd platform which she got. It was quite deep within the site. Once they all disbursed 4 more tents appeared by the fire pit while I was busy finishing my set up and eating. Twister and Chad the Dad, Gray squirrel and another hiker. I went out to River's site to see if she needed water and we stopped and talked with Twister for a few. He's out for a few days hiking a section with Chad who he met in GA at the start of their hikes. Twister completed his in July. Chad is taking it slowly because his wife's going to summit Katahdin with him and they have a particular date they have to work with. After my dinner I brushed my teeth and crawled into bed. It's windy out tonight and I'm set up free standing on the platform. I don't think I'll blow away but the vestibule on one side is just flapping in the breeze so I stuck a rock on it, like a paperweight. I'm toasty warm and snuggled in. Looking forward to slumber!","Stratton

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601636,"I slept well on my platform and woke up at 5:30 with the tents around me all still and quiet. I packed up making as little noise as possible then sat on the edge of the platform and had cold cereal for breakfast. I'd purchased granola and powdered milk at the IGA. It was a nice change from my usual oatmeal and a time saver since I didn't have to boil water. At 6:45 I had filtered water and was on trail. 
I love early morning on the trail. The way the sunlight filters thru the trees, the quiet, everything about it. I saw no one until River caught up with me on the climb of Biggelow Jr. I couldn't stop eating the blueberries at the top. I'd eat a few handful and tell myself I needed to keep moving and then I'd stop and eat more. They were to date the sweetest and plumpest I've had on trail. While enduring the seemingly endless rock slab descent and telling myself this should be the last one I met a sobo hiker. An older man who must have started the day early as well. We didn't talk long, he didn't seem to speak English very well but I told him not to pass up the blueberries. I stopped at little Biggelow lean to for a 30 minute lunch break. The site was extremely nice and I would have enjoyed staying there. The privy was a 2 seater! I'm confident there's no one on trail that I'd consider sharing with so I was sure to lock the door while in use! When I got back to the trail Twister and Chad the Dad were just passing by. We're all headed to the same stealth camping spot near East Carry Pond which will put us 10 miles from the ferry tomorrow. I was hoping there'd be room at the site when we got there and there was. Twister and Chad were all set up and I opted for a small spot wedged in between some trees. After setting up we went to the beach for a quick swim. I could see the leaches so it was a very quick swim! But I also knew I wanted to get clean and a good quick swim is the best way I know out here. So in I went and I couldn't get out fast enough. I stood in the shallow water and scrubbed the mud off my legs and rinsed my bandana then headed back to camp. I went out in the back beyond my tent with my clothes bag, dried off with my shirt and put on my pajamas. Toasty warm and dry I sat down with everyone else and made dinner. The sound of the loons was lovely and they continued for a long time. I was afraid that when we get to Caratunk we wouldn't get a bed at the hostel as there are only 9. I had enough service to get a text to Brian but I don't always receive them. But Brian was able to get a private room with two twin beds reserved and text River to let her know. After that I was able to doze off to the sound of the loons until 2 hikers came in by headlamps and I heard Twister tell them to wander past my tent and the fallen trees to a space out back. They did and they were quiet setting up and I drifted away again.","Safford notch campsite

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601637,"Last night was spectacular sleeping by the lake and I woke around 5am to the sound of loons. I stretched in my tent and packed everything up before having a cold cereal breakfast again with River, Twister and Chad the Dad. While eating breakfast and orange glow came thru the trees so we all went out to the trail and took pictures of the sunrise and mist on the lake. I wish I could wake up to something so natural and beautiful every day. It was a perfect morning when I hit the trail, the first one out of camp. I love the smell of ponds, lakes and rivers. I had the trail to myself. I passed by ET packing up her site about a quarter mile up trail but saw no one else for miles except the person on the opposite shore who waived to me as I crossed a couple of bog bridges. There was some beautiful trail today, a pine needle path which is my favorite! But there was also lots of roots, rocks and mud. About 2 miles before I reached the shore of the Kennebec River I passed 3 older hikers. 
At the River I met Rob the ferry man. The Kennebec is perhaps the most formidable unbridged crossing on the AT and the ATC provides free ferry service to hikers between 9am and 2pm. I arrived at 11:45 and watched Rob cross several hikers as I waited for River. I was becoming concerned and asked the late arrival to our camp last night if they'd seen her and they thought she was perhaps 20 more minutes out. They introduced themselves as Electrolyte and Noodle Harvester. Very pleasant couple. Then the 3 older hikers arrived and shortly behind them River. I talked with one of the older hikers, he's from Washington State. He was hiking this section with his sister and her husband but was finished and headed back to his car in Stratton tomorrow.  I mentioned that my trail friend Twister was in need of a ride back to his car in Stratton also. But he didn't offer and we didn't exchange information other than where they're staying tonight. When Rob crossed us he came ashore and drew a map in the sand to our hostel and the Boy Scout trail magic. So of course we went there 1st and enjoyed a soda, burger and hotdog. From there we walked the .3 to the Caratunk Hostel where I was welcomed by Paul who had my package. I got checked in, got a coffee milkshake and sat in a rocker on the porch watching Gibson the cat show hikers how to take a lawn nap. One other hiker did the same. I logged into the WiFi and was able to get Brian's text messages and let him know I'm at the hostel. It was an awesome thing that Brian had called to make the reservation here for us because when Paul went to get my box from the post office, which I confirmed yesterday was in and authorized Paul to pick it up and it wasn't there. Paul and Brian worked on getting my footloose package back to the post office and in Paul's hands. Apparently it wasn't removed from the truck and it took a wild ride, having to be intercepted and trucked back to Caratunk for Saturday morning. Paul said Brian was really nice, which if course I already know, and that I should bring him back some day for a visit. Paul, Bonny and Jason are amazing. It's wonderful what this hostel does for hikers. It's clean, homey, comfortable and the service is 5 star. Our laundry was done within 1.5  hours of us bringing it in. A clean towel was on each bed and the shower was good and hot. Paul has a resupply that knocked my socks off and includes special order items such as dehydrated vegetables all well priced and in small baggies. I think if Paul didn't have what you needed he'd find a way to get it because he's devoted to hikers. At 5:30 we were shuttled to Northern Outdoors for dinner at our request. The service and food were not good but the company was. We shuttled and ate with Cribbage  and Noodle Harvester and they were very enjoyable. We saw Twister and I told him about the 3 older hikers and that they were driving one back to his car tomorrow in Stratton and where they were staying. Twister called the place and described the people explaining he needed a ride and would fill their gas tank. They called him back and Twister bought me a beer. Glad that worked out! We got back to the hostel around 8pm and I tucked myself in and journaled. Breakfast promises to be awesome and I hope so because all I can smell is the pork that is slow cooking at 250° in the oven and it's making me hungry. The hostel has walk up food service, milkshakes and pulled pork sandwiches. Hope I don't sleep walk down to the kitchen!","East Carry Pond stealth site

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601690,"I absolutely loved staying at Paul's hostel. I was comfortable all night but as usual I think too much about the upcoming section and slept intermittently. It was very hard to leave this morning. Breakfast was served family style in the dining room which is furnished with antiques properly suited for the farmhouse. I enjoyed the conversation and company of our fellow hikers and we all worked together to clear the table for Bonny. Then I finished my pack, squared up with Paul, filled my water bottles, hugged Paul and Bonny and said a goodbye to Gibson before setting off down the street and to the trailhead. It was a late start at 8:45. 
Today's hike wasn't the most difficult but it was hard on me and it was my own fault. Staying hydrated is key and I let myself down a bit in that department today. Hiking up from the trailhead I stopped and talked with Ridge runner Edbeard. He confirmed that the Penobscot tribe has booked the campgrounds in Baxter State Park for Labor Day weekend and to avoid summiting Katahdin during that time if possible. No  problem for me, we're expecting at Sept 6th summit. I ran into Cribbage and Red Hawk at the blue blaze trail to the pond and decided not to hike the .2 down and then back up. I wasn't going to swim and I didn't want to waste the time. I also met the Bolton family hiking with 3 beautiful little girls all wearing custom Pleasant Pond Mountain t-shirts. They let me skip in front of them as we began the climb. My pack felt heavy today with a fresh 3 day supply and I noticed increased humidity so of course my shirt was drenched half way up. At the summit we had a snack break with River, Cribbage and Red Hawk and the Bolton family arrived for their lunch at the summit. After enjoying a handful of blueberries compliments of Red Hawk's hard work I continued on. I drank almost my liter and a half of water by the time I reached Moxie Pond at 4:15. Not enough for the 7.5 hours of work and 12 miles of hiking. I was thinking about getting to the parking lot and taking one of the stealth sites noted there, feeling unable to hike the remaining 2.8 miles to Bald Mt Brook shelter as I'd planned. Red Hawk and Cribbage were sitting on a dock at the pond so I dropped my pack and joined them for a rest, drinking what was left in my half liter bottle. River arrived shortly after and when I voiced that I couldn't make it to the shelter they were all surprised especially River who knows me. Surmising that I was dehydrated and probably hungry River went to my pack and grabbed my empty bottle, filter and snacks from my waist bag where I keep them. I filtered water and drank 20oz and ate my snacks. At 5pm we left there and I hiked the remaining 2.8 miles making it to Bald Mt Brook shelter and settling up camp by 6:30pm on my second wind. The trail was cooperative and I felt so much better. The others stopped at the power lines to pick blueberries but arrived right after me. I washed up in the brook and Red Hawk entertained us with some hiker TV during dinner (a fire in the fire pit). We hung our bags all from his bear line and went to bed as the forest darkened at 8pm. One other tenter was there but he never came out and one other hiker passed thru. I'm quite comfy in this spot and I can hear the Brook from my tent. It's very soothing.","Caratunk B&B Hostel

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601725,"I heard the mystery tenter packing up when I awoke at 5:30. I had the contents of my tent packed and was outside it in time to say goodbye as he sprinted nobo up the trail. I could tell River was awake by the rustling but there was no sign of life over at Cribbage and Red Hawk's tent. I made my way across the stream and sobo to the privy grabbing my food bag on the way back. I packed up my tent and grabbed a log near River and had my breakfast of oatmeal and coffee. Then I stowed away my food bag and headed north. This morning was a climb right off which I knew in advance, up Bald Mt which is also known as Moxie Bald Mt because of Moxie pond down below. The mountain was definitely bald on top with lots of exposed ledge and cairns to guide the way. I got a cell signal and was able to say hello to Brian. Then the wind picked up and the clouds rolled over head and I started to chill so I moved on down toward the descent. I noticed a lot of barren blueberry bushes and bear scat so I kept on moving tapping the trekking pole that's missing the rubber tip on the ledge as I went along so I'd make some noise. Today was very humid so I was sweating even walking down hill. Once I was down from the mountain the trail rolled along the river going up and down. I don't understand why it can't stay down by the river or stay up above it. Why must it be constantly up and down? It just makes extra work and when it's up it slopes to the right so my right foot is in charge of keeping us from sliding off the edge all the time. 
There were lots of roots and mud and then I saw it.....like in my dream.....the long mud puddle with the clean rocks as far as I could see! The mud was dried out but the rocks....it was just creepy! I rock hopped thru as quickly as possible. Aside from Cribbage and Red Hawk and Dr Who I saw only one other nobo hiker today. River and I met at the Horseshoe Canyon Lean to and neither of us thought the site felt like home. Water was .2 away, the tent sites weren't inviting and the place was deserted. It was 4:15 so we decided we'd look for a stealth site reported to be .7 away and we set out. We saw a sobo couple headed to the shelter. They'll probably have it to themselves tonight. The stealth site was available and perfect. Right next to the river with a spot on each side of the trail for our tents. We set up and took turns at the river. I was so hot and sticky that I stripped down to nothing after filtering my water and sat right down on a submerged rock and bathed with my bandana. I don't know if any hiker walked by and saw me from the trail and I really didn't care. I was going to feel clean and refreshed before climbing into my tent. We made dinner and shared a log with a view of the river and then shared some trail brownies with coffee. We brushed and turned in for the night. I left one vestibule open so I'd have the fresh air and river view.  Our bear bags were hanging nearby and I thought with the sound of the river I wouldn't hear any animals and it made me feel vulnerable to have the vestibule open. But I decided to change my self talk about instead and enjoy this beautiful opportunity. I'm looking forward to seeing the river when I wake in the morning. I've decorated the sapling on the other side of my tent with my laundry but with this humidity it's not likely anything will dry.","Bald Mt Brook shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601729,"I had trouble falling asleep but once I got there I slept until 6:45. Late! I packed up and had a cold breakfast. River left before me. Once I finished breakfast I went to put my pack on when a certain urge hit me. So I grabbed my trowel and headed for a little privacy hoping I wouldn't find the same spot River did last night and this morning. Yes! She finally christened her trowel! It only took over 1,000 miles. 
I headed out at 8:15 and it was already hot and humid. Almost immediately I was annoyed with the ridiculous riverside ups and downs again. The trail guide looked pretty flat today but instead it was a steady 8+ mile incline to route 15 up and over Buck's Hill, which I renamed briefly. I came across the old AT shortly after that, 2 miles right into town instead of 3 miles to Route 15. I was so tempted. The trail was rerouted to eliminate a road walk in a town where every hiker stops. Monson is the southern end of the 100 mile wilderness and it is a hiker town with hostels, restaurants, resupply, visitor center for Baxter State Park and post office all within walking distance. I made it to the road at 12:15 with my shirt completely soaked in sweat and empty water bottles. I had eaten a handful of trail mix while hiking in an effort to quiet the growling beast in my stomach. What I thought were milk chocolate covered nuts turned out to be caramel. I had shoved quite the large handful of the assorted nuts, balls and M&Ms in my mouth while hiking and breathing hard only to quickly realize what I had was a mouth full of gooey caramel and I couldn't breathe. I thought for a second and immediately stopped so I could slow my breathing and not die by caramel asphyxiation on the trail. It took a few minutes to clear the mess using water and slowly chewing and swallowing. Now that I know what those cute little balls are I think I'll enjoy them individually and separate from the rest of the mix! So when I got to the road I was more than ready to see Poet pull up in an air conditioned SUV for a short ride back to the famous Shaw's hostel. Before getting a tour we pulled some chairs into the shade and were handed ice cold PBR. Now I'm feeling better and within 5 minutes I was buzzing. Beer goes right to work after my hike and I'm guessing it has to do with the fast metabolism. Once I felt steady we got a tour and checked in. Loaner clothes and a shower and I was a new person. We went to the post office, the general store and had lunch at Lake View where the owner Rebekah took excellent care of us providing us our own personal fan and cold water we didn't have to filter. This town certainly knows hikers! After that we stopped at saw Ridge runner Edbeard at the visitor center. I later returned to the general store and got a wonderful deli sandwich for dinner which I enjoyed in our private room with 2 fans. It was 85° and humid and I couldn't stand to be anywhere else. I turned in at 9 hoping it would cool down so I can fall asleep but I was still awake at midnight. At least I have tomorrow off.","Piscataqouis River mile 2067

At about 4am I finally felt cool and pulled the covers over me and dozed off. I'd signed up for breakfast so at 6:45 I was in line for the bathroom and downstairs just after 7. I ordered my eggs ""on a plate"" when asked, having no preference. They came out fresh and hot, over medium with home fries and 4 strips of bacon. I cleaned my plate and washed it all down with coffee and orange juice. It was all delicious and then I felt like taking a nap. But I didn't. Instead I thinned out my pack to only the absolute necessary items for the next 8 hiking days. I put the extras in a box to be shipped home. I then bagged up 7 days of food and purchased the snacks I was short from Poet's Gear Emporium. I put my extra meals in the box being shipped home and added a t-shirt and jar of Maine blueberry jelly for Brian. When the post office opened after lunch I shipped the package out, had lunch at the Lake Shore and got my AT passport stamped at the visitor center. Wendy was working today and I expressed my anxiety over the 100 mile wilderness. She tried to help me by going over the topography and how this section breaks down. Having an expectation is helpful to me and I did feel more comfortable. 
The rest of the day was just lazy, spent mostly in our room journaling and studying the guide. I bought a sandwich from the general store for dinner and put it in the fridge along with a protein shake and Body Armor hydration drink. I went outside for a little while but it was too hot so I went back to my room. A few minutes later I heard the thunder and the splatter of rain and saw Poet, Hippy Chick and their children run inside. Around 7pm I ate my sandwich and chips and it was absolutely delicious. Then I brushed my teeth and settled into bed before 8:30. I fell asleep but woke up at 11pm and River still wasn't in the room. I drifted off again and she came in sometime after midnight.

It will be 7 days or so before I get another one. I shampooed twice for good measure but it isn't likely to help me in the coming days. I felt better though. I dressed and went downstairs for the protein shake that I'd stashed in the fridge.  It was delicious. In the common area were a father and daughter who'd flown in and arrived at 3am, sleep deprived. They're hiking the 100 mile wilderness together and it's her 1st backpacking experience. I grabbed a coffee and went back upstairs. I really like quiet and peaceful spaces and I soak this one in for a few while River showers. Then I break down the shipping boxes and take them out to recycle and bring out trash down too. Just before 7 breakfast was in full swing and I enjoyed an egg with home fries and bacon. Poet also made me 3 GF blueberry pancakes but I could only eat 2. Delicious! River and I had staged our packs for the 8:15 shuttle so we squared away our bills in the gear shop and waited by the SUV. In the way to the trail head Poet gave everyone some good tips including a reminder about the treacherous slate in the 1st 15 miles, even more so because it's wet from the rain last night. At 8:45 we were hiking. We passed everyone in the group after we took pictures of the warning sign at the start of the 100 mile wilderness which is now complete with a skull and crossbones sticker. No wonder I have anxiety! Today's goal is 15 miles and the terrain is moderate. Besides the group that we left back at the trail head I only saw 4 other hikers today. I stopped for and River came by while I was eating. At 6:30 we took a stealth campsite just on the other side of Vaughn stream which is very wide and the guide says you have to ford, it's not a dry crossing. River went first determined to rock hop and not ford. Near the other shore one of the wet rocks got her and she landed left foot and butt in the water. She recovered and sat on the rock taking off her boots right there in the stream when suddenly as if in slow motion I watched her slide into the water pack and all and end up in a pool with her arms and feet all sticking up. I laughed so hard! She joined in the laughter eventually. But she was initially very unhappy with her situation. It's the first night out here and it's chilly and now she's wet. But we made the best of it and set up camp right away and she put up a line to dry things out. We ate our dinner and brushed and hung our bags on the same line. It was after 8 when we turned in.

Shortly after I set out a familiar face passed me. Then his wife a few minutes later asked if Galaxy had passed me. I couldn't place her but knew she was familiar. I later caught up to them on one of the summits and thru conversation realized I'd met them at Joe Dodge lodge the evening we'd received the trail magic wine from the other diners. It was good to see them and have some conversation in between climbing. They left their jobs and sold all but the car and the couch and they're on their honeymoon! Not a very romantic one they agree. Before they came out to hike they started a non profit. While having lunch together on another summit I connected them with Alligator. She works for a non profit that helps non profits. While enjoying cell service on the summit as well, I received confirmation that Brian had reserved a site at Katahdin Stream campground for the 5th. He's planning to come up for the night and summit with us before he takes me home and then to Harper's Ferry. The site holds 6 so I've asked him if I can extend the invitation to share the site with Galaxy and Songbird. We also met Mid West Mama today. This section will complete the trail for her, which she's been working on for 12 years! Now that's dedication! We enjoyed her company and she's headed to the same shelter we are. 
The summits today were numerous ups and downs and included Barren Mt, Fourth Mt, Mt Third and a half, Third Mt, Columbus Mt and many other hills, rock scrambles and ledges. I would have liked a bigger mile day but I just couldn't. At least the weather is cooler and I'm sweating less. We got to the shelter around 5:30 and there weren't really any good tent sites. Galaxy and Songbird hammock so they were all set and River and I stayed in the shelter. There were about 6 students from College of the Atlantic doing their orientation. I thought it was pretty neat. They're out for 6 days, tomorrow being their last. We set up, had dinner and they entertained us with some hiker TV. A nice little fire before sleep. It was a bit cool but I was warm under my quilt. 2 of the students stayed in the shelter also. Just before bed they attempted to hang their 2 large mesh food and trash bags inside the shelter. River and I were both stunned and River spoke right up. They ""don't believe"" in bears we were told.  Well we've had personal experience that proves they can be a real concern.

I didn't see them again until fording at the river. There was a large group, probably 20 people with kids headed out to Screw Auger Falls. They had trouble fording in bare feet. River and Peppermint came across as I was redressing my feet on the north side where there was actually a bench to sit on. One of the day hikers left behind the towel they dried off with. I filtered water and set out. Some if the trail was easier today. Or less difficult I should say. A sobo passed me and he looked familiar but I couldn't place him. Later River told me it was Napper. He'd been off trail for 4 weeks for a stress fracture in his foot so he went up to Katahdin and will hike to Mt Moosikauke and then go to Harper's Ferry. So he'll be behind us a Dozer is ahead of us already hiking south from Harper's Ferry. I made the climb up Gulf Hagus Mt okay and then West Peak gave me an ass whooping! .2 from the top I was soaked and chilled with the stiff breeze and I just wanted it to end! I talked myself thru it and over Hay Mt which was much kinder. I landed at a stealth site just ahead of River. We got dry clothes on and set up camp then ate. We were both in a hurry to get warm so we drank a liter of warm electrolytes and it was delicious. Handing my bear bag was tough and I got frustrated. Just not many good trees for hang. So I walked .10 north on the trail and got a line up. Tomorrow we'll go over White Cap Mt and get a view of Katahdin. We'll also pass our halfway mileage mark. The trail smoothes out after that and we'll try for 22 miles so we can stay at Antlers campsite. The wind is still pretty steady. I hope tomorrow is a little warmer.","Chairback gap lean to

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602491,"I started packing up around 5:15 after stretching. When I had everything ready to go I went and got my bear bag down from up the trail and joined River on a log for my breakfast of Good To Go Granola. I love this stuff. It's coated with powdered milk I guess so I just add less than a half cup of water and I've got a cold cereal. It can be eaten hot but I am loving it cold and it stays with me a little longer than my oatmeal. 
We left camp at 6:34 and immediately climbed White Cap. As promised we got a view of Katahdin from the peak. The sky was a bit cloudy and River noticed some dark gray clouds and made a beeline for the treeline wanting to be off the summit if a storm should come. I didn't see her again until just briefly at Logan Brook Lean to where I stopped for the privy and water. This spot marks our half way point on the trail in miles hiked. That's pretty exciting to think about! I hiked for a few more hours and stopped at Crawford Pond where I sat on a piece of log that had been stood up in the sand and was the perfect height. There was no one around at this beautiful beach. I enjoyed the solitude along with my summer sausage and crackers. With my break over I continued on seeing only a few sobo section hikers. It was very quiet. Except the bugs. No one talks about them but they're annoying. These little black nats that have been a part of my hike since somewhere around boiling springs. Nasty nats I call them. At any given time there can be a half dozen flying right in front of my eyeballs. All vying for a spot on my eyelashes where they like to land. I'm so annoyed by them I wave at them and try to blow them away from my face. But sometimes I let them land. And I hear the voice of Jeff Dunham's character Ahmed.....""I kill you!""and after they land on my lashes I take my bandana and wipe my eye and presto.....dead nasty nats. I love cook or breezy days because Ahmed gets a day off! There were long stretches of nice smooth pine needle carpet and I cruised at 2.5 mph thru them. I was filtering water at a stream 4.3 miles from Jo Mary Rd when I received a text from River saying there was trail magic there. So I upped my pace naturally! Along the way since I didn't have music, I've used up the battery in my MP3 player, I imagined all sorts of things about the trail magic. Kind of like what you do if you buy a lottery ticket. It's really a cheap way to daydream. I conjured up all kinds of things about who was there and what they had. When I arrived River commented on my speed, so I know I was flying! Baggette was a thru hiker from Manchester NH and hiked last year with her Mom. She chose to do Trail magic here because this is a spot they could really have used it. She had ice cold polar seltzer water which is my at home drink if choice and it was wonderful. Also some snacks, hand sanitizer, toilet paper and some camp bracelets she'd made. I joined River, Galaxy and Songbird when I arrived and baggette gave me her chair which I sweat all over. I couldn't help it, it's more humid and warmer today than it has been. At 4:40 we thanked her and left together to conquer the last 4.4 miles to Antlers campsite. It was enjoyable to hike in together after a nice rest. When we arrived at camp around 6:30 River had gotten in first and claimed a site. She's been here before and checked on the peninsula for me and there was a site at the very end which I eagerly claimed. I could bathe and see both sunrise and sunset and have some privacy which is rare out here. I enjoyed all of that, especially the bathing. I hung my shirt on a trekking pole after rinsing it out in the lake and hung it on a tree branch to dry overnight. It smells a bit less now but I know that won't last long. With sunset coming around 7:30 now there Really wasn't much time so I ate my dinner and crawled into bed to text with Brian and post a couple of journal entries. My cell service is amazing out here! I was even able to text Brian a couple of pictures. I'm looking forward to seeing him in a few days and it keeps me rolling on. The next 2 days will need to be 17-19 mile days. We'd like to get to Abol Bridge to the store for soda, ice cream and food. I don't think I can get enough calories in what I carry so I really need the town food to supplement. Sometimes when I'm hiking I feel like I'm folding in half at the waist and I remind myself to stand up straight. I know I've lost more weight but I won't know how much until I get home. At about 9:30 I said goodnight to Brian so I can get some sleep.","Stealth site at White Brook Trail JCT mile 2116.1
",Antlers campsite,"Sep 02, Sun",21.90
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602492,"I slept in a bit today after hearing it sprinkle on my tent a couple of times. I knew it was cloudy and not worth getting up for the sunrise so I waited until 6:15. I tried to keep my feet elevated last night on my pack but it wasn't always comfortable and my hips ached so I couldn't sleep too long on one side. I was cleaning up from my breakfast and my site was all packed up when I heard Chad the Dad shout out asking if I was dressed before coming onto my site. Makes me wonder if he saw me bathing last night, creepy thought. River was telling him how nice the site was and he should check it out. He's hiking 5 miles today and staying at White House landing. I'm looking at 17.5 or 21.5 and it's warm and humid again and I left camp at 8:40 so I'm not optimistic about the 21.5 but we'll see. Heat and humidity really drain me.
My first stop was a brand new privy about 3 miles north. It was outfitted with what appears to be handicap ramp and grab bars. In the wilderness on a non accessible path. Again today I was hiking alone and took my first break about 6 miles in at a brook. I sat on the ground and leaned back on my pack a little off trail. I saw Galaxy and Songbird approach the stream and stop on the other side for water. They didn't see me and I heard them fooling around and singing. Then River came along and saw me once she crossed asking if I was okay because I'm never resting like that. I filtered water and headed out shortly after that and behind them. River and I stopped a couple of miles up trail at a lean to for lunch right at noon and Galaxy and Songbird continued another 3+ to a lake. The trail between the shelter and lake was rough and I was glad we stopped first. My feet hate all these rocks and roots. Again I dragged behind and when I got to the lake River and Galaxy were swimming. We watched a sea plane land. Dr Who came by and we all had good conversation about the trail and how our bodies feel. Dr Who was going to walk a little on the next road just so he can look up and look around while walking, something we can't do out here. Sometimes I wish I saw more wildlife and it occurs to me that more wildlife has probably seen me. In all seriousness I'm like a horse with blinders on. There could be 6 black bears wearing sunglasses and holding banjos standing next to the trail as I pass by and unless they make noise I won't see them. There have been many times I haven't seen other hikers hiking towards me until they say hello. I'm always looking down at where I'm stepping. A little road walk sounds nice! After the lake I stopped to fill up my water at the next shelter before a 2 mile climb. This little 1,500'+ Mt packed a punch to the gut with the climb up. Very steep. Galaxy and Songbird were with me and we all knew we'd be finding a stealth spot tonight. At one point Galaxy and Songbird we're resting during a climb and so was I, but up trail a bit, when a bird near them started making a racquet as if to protest them stopping there. Galaxy shouted ""shut up! You've got wings!"" I laughed out loud. They didn't realize I was so close.  I'm thinking River made it to Rainbow lean to but there's no way we can before dark. I started the descent while they were still resting at the summit. I heard thunder rumble and a few sprinkles so I stopped and put my pack cover on and quickened my pace. Just before the pond I tripped and did a belly flop right on the trail. If course to add insult to injury a half second later my pack caught up and gave me an extra shove just to be sure I was down. I arrived at the pond where Guthooks notes stealth sites near the water and I found the spot. There is some standing deadwood so I choose carefully my spot. It's 6:45 and I won't have much daylight. I set up my tent and head to the water, wash up and filter some. I spot a tree by the water for my bear hang and got that up. It's getting dark in the woods now that the sun has set so I ate a cold dinner of snacks and hung my bag, brushed and crawled into my tent to journal. I'm all alone here. Galaxy and Songbird must have found a spot to hammock south of me. It feels a bit uncomfortable to be alone but I am confident in my abilities and that is comforting. I have 19+ miles to hike tomorrow and it includes another climb. I'll be up as soon as I wake for an early start. There's ice cream and a bunk and a shower at the end of it!","Antlers campsite

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602493,"I wish I had slept well but despite my efforts it was a restless night for most hours. The sunlight came up over the hill and filtered thru the trees waking me around 6:15 and I had mixed feelings about needing to get up and wanting more sleep. With the need to hike 19 miles today to Abol Bridge I decided to get up. The lure of a bunk, burger and a cold beer was too much so I dressed and packed up. I felt really accomplished and proud, having gotten a few hours of sleep and waking up knowing that I'd chosen a safe site among the standing deadwood that the rising winds didn't impact. The feeling was invigorating actually and I smiled and hauled my pack down to the rock by the pond. It was stunning in the golden morning light and I smiled again. I washed my face and boiled some water after getting my bear bag down from the tree. Another success. Today is going to be a great day and I will get a view of Katahdin from the famed Abol Bridge. I'm almost there and I feel alive! I enjoyed my blueberry oatmeal and coffee while thinking about that and looking out over the pond, wishing I could share this moment with Brian but he's not here and there's no cell service. Just as I was getting ready to swing my pack on Galaxy and Songbird arrived and we all hiked out together. They found a spot to hammock about a half mile back, near the canoe launch. We all surmised that River made it to Rainbow Stream Lean To because we didn't see her at Pollywog Stream where there we some other campsites, some still occupied or at the lean to where we bumped into Dr Who, who camped at Pollywog and confirmed she wasn't there. 
We continued to Rainbow Ledges where I check my cell and had service for the first time in days, but just a bar. I called Brian for a brief conversation but the service failed after a couple of minutes and we were disconnected. It's the wilderness after all. Galaxy and Songbird passed by and continued on but I caught up to them about .2 up the way where they were stopped talking to a couple who hiked Katahdin yesterday. Behind them....my first close view of the beauty herself. My first thought was how huge she is and I say "" I change my mind, I'm not climbing that!"" but of course I was kidding. I was just taken back by her size. The Ledges were really the only climb today and a gradual incline that we all appreciated. We stopped at Rainbow Lake for lunch. It was a rocky shore line and we enjoyed some shade and nice rocks for sitting while we were mesmerized by the view. I couldn't think of a better lunch spot it was just so peaceful and relaxing. But after 45 minutes or so it was time to continue on. We'd done 10 miles by noon and we had 9 more to go so I filled up my water and headed out while Galaxy and Songbird were packing up. I stopped at Hurd Brook Lean To 5 miles later where they caught up and had a snack. 
When I arrived at the dirt road I took a right. Logging trucks and cars produced a cloud of dust and I felt like I should walk with my eyes closed. It was distracting and I forgot about the significance of the bridge I was now standing on. Abol Bridge. I saw the campground and the river and I thought as I looked at the water left and right about whether or not I should take a photo. And I looked up the river and saw her. Katahdin. Perfectly lit by the 5:45 lowering sunlight and absolutely picture perfect. Emotion welled within me and I let it out. I can't believe I'm here. Finally. Over 1,200 miles of walking. I took some photos and crossed the rest of the bridge to the Abol store where I found River in the dining room to no surprise. She was at a table with Katherine who she'd met at Rainbow Stream lean to last night and woken up as she hiked in by headlamp and also Dr Who. They'd all eaten and River had ordered round 2. She informed me they close at 7pm so I got the waitress and ordered a beer and burger, both delicious. Galaxy and Songbird arrived within minutes. 
After food and conversation we went to the bunkhouse that River had paid for and gifted spaces to all of us for the night. Very kind and very appreciated. We all got showers and turned in for the night, clean for a little while anyway. The bunks are metal and they make lots of noise when you move, so the 5 of us had a symphony going for a while. Tomorrow there's a breakfast included with the stay and then we'll enter into Baxter State Park and hike 10 miles to Katahdin Stream Campground where we'll meet Brian. I'm excited and I'm also anxious because he wants to climb Katahdin with us and that is a huge undertaking that I hope he isn't underestimating.","Stealth site at Crescent Pond mile 2155.8
",Abol Bridge,"Sep 04, Tue",19.10
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602575,"The squeaky beds and Katherine getting up to pee twice disrupted my sleep. I noticed when I opened my eyes around 6:30 everyone was up before me. I made my way to the bathhouse and then up to the store to join the others for breakfast. As I suspected the breakfast was mostly bread and pastry products so I ate 2 yogurts and some fruit before buying some snacks for the road and heading back to the cabin to pack up. On the way back it hit me how close I am to finishing up the north bound leg of my hike and I let that roll around in my head and heart while I packed up. A lot of emotion comes up for me on trail. At first I tried to push it away, embarrassed but I've learned to let it come and to be comfortable with it, even embrace it at times. 
Once I was packed up I stopped at the bathhouse and filled my water bottles and walked towards the entrance gate. Out on the road, past the generator that the store operates on and back into the woods. As I came upon the footbridge I had a beautiful view of Katahdin. It was a moment as I was about to enter Baxter State Park on that footbridge. There was a man on the bridge sitting down on the edge closest to me. Without introduction he asked what my plans were today. ""Excuse me""? Then he apologized and introduced himself as Baxter's version of a ridge runner with the trail name of Longjohn. We had a great conversation after that and I shared my plans with him and received some helpful information on the park and thru hiker process. As I was almost done Galaxy and Songbird arrived. We stayed a few more minutes and then Longjohn followed us to the kiosk and we signed in. We left Longjohn there and hiked together for a while before I hiked ahead. I thoroughly enjoyed my short time in Baxter State Park stopping at the waterfalls and soaking in the beautiful trail, much of which was smooth and easy. I was going to stop for lunch but instead just had a couple of snacks and made it to the Katahdin Stream campground at 2:30.The ranger wasn't in so I hung out with Galaxy and Songbird at covered picnic table once they arrived and we all tried unsuccessfully to fight off the black flies. They were viscous! I spent all of 10-15 minutes at the stream soaking my feet and a bottle of root beer in the icy cold water before laying on the grass wishing the bugs would let me nap. I saw Glider, Dr Who and a few others waiting for the ranger also and congratulated a handful of hikers including Peppermint who summited today. It was my turn to see the ranger and get my paperwork done. She was very helpful, checking with the gate to see if Brian was in the park yet ( he wasn't) and if there were any open sites in the campground. We were reserved for site 1 in Foster Field which is 2 miles from the campground, and we'd have to catch Brian on his way thru the park or hike on the road to get there. I opted to go out to the road and wait. About 30 minutes later I flagged Brian down and we drove into the campground to pick up my gear and the others. He said he was told at the gate that hikers were waiting for him on the road, so the ranger must have communicated that to the gate after I left. 
We all settled into our site which was awesome and spacious with picnic tables and clean privy. Brian brought a small feast of hot dogs, burgers, chips, salads, drinks, etc., and we all filled up as Galaxy tended to a fire in the provided pit. It was a really great relaxing evening filled with sweet memories with good friends. We retired to our spaces and I snuggled into my tent with Brian. It was hot and stuffy so we opened the vestibules for some air hoping for a dry night. I'm not sure I'll sleep much with so much anxiety about tomorrow and excitement of catching up with Brian.","Abol Bridge

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602579,"We woke up to cloudy skies after a short night of sleep. We chatted until after midnight and then I was woken by what sounded like a man vomiting from the next site over where there were a group of 6 hikers who are summiting today also. We all packed up dry tents and were almost done with breakfast when the rain started falling and we headed for the covered picnic table to finish up. With our gear stowed in the SUV and our day packs ready we all piled in for the 2 mile drive back to the campground and the trail. But I'll be honest, I think Baxter State Park has their trail and road mileage a bit off and it's more like 3 miles. 
The rain had stopped by the time we arrived at the rangers office where River, Galaxy and Songbird left their packs. If they make it back to the ranger's station by 3:30 they'll take the shuttle to Millinoket. If not we'll bring them because we're planning to spend the night there and drive home Friday. It was 7:37am when we all left the trailhead together. We hiked the first mile together and separated at the falls. Brian and I were slower because he's not conditioned like we are and thus it'll take him longer. As I hiked I thought of the Penobscot tribe and I thought about how sacred this mountain is to them, almost feeling like a trespasser. They don't climb the mountain. The trail became increasingly steeper and more technical we rested more and hiked slower. At the steepest parts we discussed the time and considered turning back. My cutoff time was 1:30. If we couldn't summit by then we'd need to go back and I'd have to summit another day alone. But Brian pushed through after consideration and assessment of his ability and we made it to the summit where we met with River, Galaxy and Songbird as they were descending. It was 1:30. I'm so proud of Brian and he was so happy to complete this milestone with me. We walked side by side the last few feet to the sign and I was overcome by emotions. I kneeled in front of the sign and held onto it. Brian teared up too and we embraced sharing a very special moment. There was just one other couple at the summit and we each took photos for the other. The clouds blew in and out exposing beautiful views but the wind was cold and we retreated after just a few minutes where we stopped to fuel up with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before tackling the rest of the descent. 
The AT ( Hunt Trail) is how we ascended but we chose to descend on the Abol Trail. It was 3.4 miles instead of 5.3 and descending is difficult. We'll need to be down by 7pm and either hike the road back 2 miles to the campground or hitch a ride. It doesn't matter how we descend, only the miles to the summit count anyway. When we arrived at the steep boulders Brian chose to tackle many of them on his butt, wearing holes in the seat of his shorts but it's how he felt safe and there's no shame in that. These Trails are very steep and dangerous. Around 6:15 we arrived at Abol Campground and spoke with a camper there. She didn't offer us a ride so we moved on. I stopped to use the privy and Brian continued walking running into a ranger who was headed to Katahdin Stream campground and scored us a ride in the bed of her pick up truck. Yay Brian!!
At Katahdin Stream I didn't see River, Galaxy and Songbird. No note on our SUV or at the ranger's station so we thought they'd caught a ride. We agreed to take a hiker named Donny Darko to Millinoket and save him the $60 shuttle fee. As we were driving out the main road we found River, Galaxy and Songbird waiting on the road for us. Oops! We crammed 4 into the back seat and had some great laughs on the way. I don't think anyone cared that they were crammed. We stopped at the gate and Brian said a short hello to Katrina who works at the park and he served in the Navy with but hasn't seen since 2004. Within 30 minutes we were in town and I dropped our gang off at the first restaurant we saw and drove Donny Darko a few more miles to a hotel before returning to dine with them. After dinner we drove to our hotel where Sara met us and took River, Galaxy and Songbird to Lewiston. I was so exhausted we checked in, showered and fell into bed. I haven't slept well for 3 nights in a row but I bet I break that cycle tonight! It was a memorable and wonderful day and I'm just going to marvel in the thought of it all night.","Katahdin Stream campground

I washed all my gear, shopped for food and made up 5 resupply boxes to help Brian. Eddyman and Alligator texted River and I about Eddyman meeting us in Harper's Ferry and hiking with us to Marion VA which would help him finish the southern half of the trail. We made all the arrangements and will hike out together on the 11th. I'm super excited to see him and his wife Susan and to be hiking together again. There are some hurricanes on the horizon so we may hit rain but we'll just have to see what we get. Brian and I drove the 10 hrs to Harper's Ferry WV on Sunday arriving just before midnight. We slipped into our room at the B&B quietly and right into bed. On Monday morning we caught up with the owners at breakfast and then visited the ATC for an update of my hike and new photo for their logs. Then we finally had time to enjoy learning about the civil war history this tiny town has to offer.

Under cloudy skies with falling drizzle and more rain in the forecast we set out sobo thru an historic alleyway and up the stone steps near the church. Brian and Susan walked with us to the church and played paparazzi. I squeezed him and kissed him goodbye. He'll make the long drive home alone. Last night we talked about the difference in the sobo leg, as I'm walking away from NH and won't really be in driving distance anymore. But in reality I'm getting closer to home with each step, leaving fewer miles between myself and Springer Mountain and then home. We all have our minds on hurricane Florence and only time will tell how she impacts us. It's also 9/11 and I took a moment of silence in the afternoon in memory. We stopped for lunch at a nice shelter. The picnic pavilion was taken over by a hiker who'd set up a tent there so we ate in the shelter. We hiked 3 more miles to the Blackburn Trail center arriving before 3:30 and waiting for River at the trail head. When she arrived she'd been on the phone with Blueberry making arrangements to get off at Route 7 and get a shuttle into Front Royal and they'd be going to NC with Blueberry's Dad and hiking from there. Word is that Shenandoah is closing due to the hurricane. Eddyman and I could go with River and Blueberry but instead we're going to make it into Front Royal by Thursday evening and get into a hostel or other safe accommodations before the storm hits. The Blackburn Trail center has a small cabin with 4 bunks and we were lucky to score the last 2 when we arrived. There are 2 brothers section hiking in the other ones. There are also some sobo hikers who will stay on the screened in porch on the main cabin. We all enjoyed the porch and watching the deer graze just behind it. My feet got wet today because of the wet foliage we walked thru. I don't do well with wet feet, they hurt. I hope my socks dry overnight but it's not likely. I called Terrapin Station hostel and they're closed for the season but I spoke with the owner, Mike and asked if he would reopen due to the hurricane. He said he'd take us in. It is the hostel closest to where the trail enters the park. We'll be there Thursday.

Between the porcupine chewing on the cabin and one of the brother's noisy sleeping pad it wasn't a solid night of sleep but I feel rested. 
After getting dressed and packing most of my bag I took my food bag out to the picnic table where a deer was grazing alongside. I watched her as Eddyman came towards the picnic table and as soon as he spoke she ran away. She was beautiful. We are and headed out around 7:30. We didn't get up until 6:10 because it's dark in the morning. Now I know that if we hike before 7:30 or so it'll be by headlamps. As we walked up the stone steps to the trail a Doe with her fawn were grazing. They looked at us for a moment before scurrying away. It's humid again today like yesterday and I'm wearing wet clothes all the way down to my socks. We hiked the first few miles then entered ""the roller coaster"". A 14+ mile section of constant ups and downs and tons of rocks. It was a difficult day with the humidity and my feet hurt from being wet. I took off my shoes and socks at lunch and my feet were white and seriously pruned. They looked like they belonged on a corpse. Really. After several minutes of airing out they started to get a little color. Maybe I'm not dead after all! The humidity continued to suck the life from me and the rocks and climbs continued their torture. At Piney point we stopped to rest along with a young couple who were at Blackburn Trail center last night also. They too wanted to get off this ride but there was one more climb before we could. Once the red color of exertion had left our faces we finished up and strolled into the Rod Hollow shelter. 
The comments on Guthooks warn of a resident porcupine. 2 nights in a row, oh goody! We chose the loft so the porcupine could have the first floor and the other hikers chose to tent. After killing a fishing spider that refused to go peacefully out of my sleeping area I got my bed set up, washed up at the spring and put on dry clothes. My entire body feels slimy, like I've been licked by a dog but it's just the buckets of sweat I have sacrificed. We 6 squeezed in at the covered picnic table for dinner. This group is very nice and while they're young they aren't smoking pot or throwing F-bombs out every 3 seconds. As the light quickly faded the choir of crickets and other night creatures turned up the volume. By the time I crawled into bed the porcupine had chimed in. I listened to it for a while, not being able to sleep because my legs were restless.  After 11pm I climbed down, peed and took some Advil. Soon the crickets will sing me a lullaby.","Blackburn Trail center

The other hikers were packing up and hiking to Front Royal where they would all 4 share a motel room until the park reopens. Eddyman and I will get as close as we can to the Front Royal Terrapin Station hostel and get a ride in. We won't be able to hike 27 miles today. Again it's a wet humid day with rain in the forecast. 
We left the shelter and hiked thru rain. Some of the trail was nice and smooth and there were far fewer rocks today but the exchange was for more mud. I don't mind the climbing, it's generally gentle switchbacks and I just take them slower. The ground is mostly clay and it's saturated so on the descents I have to be mindful because the top layer sloughs off under my steps and causes a mudslide with me along for the ride. There are few bog boards but those are covered in algae and more slick than baby powder on a marble floor. We both managed with the use of trekking poles to stay upright. The sun came out briefly as we walked thru Sky Meadows State Park. It was nice to pop out of the dark forest for a few minutes. We passed by a shelter that was .3 off trail and since the rain had stopped we agreed to hike to the nearby stream and find rocks to sit on and have lunch. As I dined on my tuna packet and crackers the rain resumed and we packed up and left. Eddyman's feet are really not doing well being always wet. Mine are waterlogged and it's painful.We came across 2 Eastern Copperhead snakes (I originally thought to be  timber rattle snakes) who appeared to be mating. I almost stepped on them as they gave no warning. He was very sweet on her kissing her neck. We left them to their rituals and bushwacked around them taking an extra 15 minutes because the forest is so thick and lush with vines in many areas. When we arrived at Tucker's Lane we called Mike from the hostel but he wasn't available to shuttle us in. We ended up taking a yellow cab but she stopped at KFC in Front Royal for an extra $1. I'd have given her $2! So I bought her a Pepsi to thank her. The hostel is in a residential neighborhood and has no sign. The neighbor confirmed we had the right place so we walked to the front door. The owner is not home but said he'd leave it open for us. It was really strange inside, not looking like a hostel at all. We both felt uncomfortable as if we were in the wrong house and at any moment the police would show up. But we found 2 chairs in the dining area and inhaled our food while I read the hostel description on Guthooks again. ""Enter thru the marked rear gate"". Hmm. Eddyman went to check it out. Sure enough the hostel is in the basement and we're in Mike's personal space. We vacate hoping to leave no trace and get ourselves into the hostel before Mike comes home. Whew! There are 12 bunks a bathroom and living room. We have WiFi, TV, shower and bunks with air mattresses. It's all comfortable. Mike entertained us for a little while and we arranged for a ride back to the trail in the morning at 8:30 to slackpack the 12 miles from Tucker's Lane to Shenandoah park. It'll be raining again. Mike's washing machine is broken so we took turns washing our stinky slimy clothes in the sink and put them in the dryer. We stuffed our soaked boots with newspaper and put them in front of the dehumidifier. Perhaps we can be dry when we leave tomorrow morning. I'm exhausted. I need some good sleep!","Rod Hollow shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602989,"I got to sleep in a little as we slack packed today, leaving the hostel at 8:30. For breakfast I had oatmeal and coffee then loaded up my day pack with the necessary items for a wet 12 mile hike. The AT is officially closed from VA to GA right now so I feel like such a rebel breaking the rules but I want to close the gap. We'll be hiking .2 into the park and then taking a .5 mile side trail right to the hostel. The forecast was for clouds before 2 and rain after.
Mike dropped us off on Tucker's Lane and we hiked out and across 55 and under 66 and back into the woods. At first the rain was just dripping off the trees as we walked thru the endless cloud but by 10am it was a steady rain and our feet were soaked. At least we know that we'll be able to get clean and dry at the end of the day. Eddyman brought dry socks to change into half way thru the day but I'm not optimistic that it'll make any difference. We saw a few deer and another turtle today, a woman walking her dog and only one other rebel hiker headed nobo. It was very quiet. It rained thru lunch and Eddyman's feet were talking to him so while we rested I threw out option B. We could hike another .8 to Route 255 and hitch a ride to town, eat, get groceries and take a cab to the hostel leaving us 3.8 miles short of the park and the 12 miles we wanted. I made it his decision, which he said he'd think about as we hiked out towards the road crossing. I couldn't stand the thought of my tuna packet so I had a small snack and daydreamed about fast food. His dry socks became a lost cause within 5 minutes as we had no way around a section with huge puddles. He almost slipped off a bog board and I dreamed further about the food thinking he'd surely want a shorter day now. As we got to the road a man was walking up with something in his hand to post. ""Wheat"" just finished the trail 2 weeks ago and was posting his information on the trail so he could help hikers out with a place to stay and rides to town while the trail is closed and the rain continues. Eddyman said he wanted to hike on as originally planned dashing my dreams of food. I'm not feeling so hot today but the rain has let up so I'm being optimistic. I know I'll feel better not leaving the miles to hike later. We thanked Wheat for helping hikers and crossed the road to find the closure signs posted at the trail there. We walked on past and up the ascent we knew we'd have. About 10 minutes in I head Eddyman exclaim ""Shit"" behind me and I stopped to see what it was about. He was upset that we didn't play our cards differently with Wheat who would have absolutely given us a ride to town for lunch and back to the trail. Damn. I could be sucking on a KFC chicken bone right now was my thought. But I still had a tuna packet lurking in my bag and I was trying to get myself closer to it. I'm feeling depleted. As we slogged up the 3.8 miles of ascent the rain and rocks picked up. My speed intensified because I just wanted to be done and back at the hostel. I can't stomach another day of pruned feet and with the park closed we know we're off tomorrow. I finished the steeper rocky climb at the top and we were inside the park for .2 before the side trail was upon us. I didn't wait for Eddyman, I was on a mission and I couldn't be done fast enough. I hit the door of the hostel and breathed a sigh of relief but I was so hungry! After my shower and dry clothes I ate crackers (but not the tuna) and felt somewhat restored. Mike came in and drove us into town for BBQ at Pave-Mint BBQ which was fantastic. It was around 4:30 so we felt like senior citizens out for the early bird special with discount and laughed at that. I enjoyed a beer with my brisket and chicken but still not feeling 100% I took a doggie bag. It's Mike's birthday so Eddyman bought his dinner and then Mike drove us to the grocery store. Ah, fresh fruit and vegetables will be wonderful! We decided on about 3 days of fresh food not knowing when the park would open or the rain would stop. Mike plugged in the fridge for us in the hostel and we put our loot in it. I turned in at 9pm. Just the quiet hum of the dehumidifier drying out our boots.... again. And I can sleep in tomorrow!","Tucker's Lane

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603218,"While hurricane Florence ravaged North Carolina we waited for the after punch in VA. It never stopped raining during our 4 days of rest and it was sometimes heavy, other times a drizzle. The ATC thru National parklands was closed from VA to GA for days and Shenandoah National Park was also closed only to reopen and then have to close Skyline Drive and some of the Waysides again. The park posted photos of the damages to road and trail on their Facebook page keeping us informed. 
Terrapin Station Hostel owner Mike drove us into town for a meal and groceries on Friday night. I wasn't feeling all that well. When I awoke on Saturday at 2am to a toothache I was happy to be in the spot I was. Unfortunately it was the weekend. We hung out reading, napping and watching TV in the hostel living room area while it rained. On Monday morning at 8am I was able to reach a dentist who could see me in a couple of hours. Mike drove me to my appointment and then to two pharmacies. The dentist understood my hiking situation and gave me a prescription for antibiotics to take now and a 2nd to fill and carry with me in the event that the issue recurs before I finish the trail. They were wonderful to deal with and probably my most enjoyable dentist visit ever. We stopped at the grocery store again for a small resupply so we'd have a couple days of trail food. The trail was still closed on Tuesday morning and it was still raining but it reopened before noon. The time off gave an opportunity for the medication to start working. At the same time I was dealing with my tooth Eddyman was dealing with some very blistered feet from 4 days of hiking in the rain. He was able to heal his feet with Epsom salt soaks while we rested. We had to hand wash our very dirty, stinky clothes and dry them because the washing machine was broken and the repair company didn't arrive until mid afternoon Tuesday and couldn't fix it. I can't wait to get my laundry really washed!River had gone home last week once the storm turned toward the Carolinas and she's planning to return on Friday but she'll be behind us and it could take her a week or so to catch up. I'm looking forward to hiking tomorrow. I have no idea what the trail conditions will be but I know they'll be sun and I'm really ready for some of that and to get miles behind me that bring me closer to Springer and home!

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603308,"I awoke in the middle of the night to the loud sound of tearing and rustling plastic. The sound it makes when you open a package of salteens or oyster crackers. I looked over at Eddyman's bunk across the room but he was still. I rolled over on my side for a better look and the noise stopped. Maybe I was hearing things or dreaming. I closed my eyes and within seconds it started again. I grabbed my phone and got up and the noise stopped once more. I turned on the flashlight app and looked around Eddyman's bunk where I thought the noise was coming from and saw nothing so I went back to bed. A few minutes later it started again and as soon as I sat up it stopped. Eventually the pattern ended and I went back to sleep. I woke at 5 and lingered in bed until 6:15 then showered and got ready. Eddyman was up when I came back to the bunk room and I mentioned the commotion last night which he slept thru. There was a package of toasted crackers with peanut butter at the foot of his bunk on the platform. He examined them and sure enough one cracker had been partially eaten. Our last night at the hostel and apparently we weren't the only ones seeking refuge from hurricane Florence but I don't think this one is a paying guest. Perhaps he'll keep River company when she gets here on Friday. 
We had breakfast and left the hostel at 7:30 walking the half mile trail back to the AT where we'd left off. We then climbed Mt Marshall and I was feeling weak and nauseous. I tried to hike through and push myself but it made me feel as though I'd faint so I sat on a log at the corner of a switchback and rested. When I neared the top Eddyman was headed back down looking for me. I was really struggling and I wasn't sure if it's because my body is fighting this infection or if it's side effects of the antibiotics. We stopped at gravel springs hut for lunch and I couldn't eat much, having no appetite. I managed to get an avocado and a few chips in me and I layed on the shelter floor on my tyvek to rest for about 40 minutes. The goal today is 15.4 to the Wayside and then grab the closest stealth site we can. The trail is in really good shape and normally I would be able to do 23 miles right to Luray but I'm feeling so ill. We stopped at Elkwallow wayside where I bought an ice cream and a Gatorade. I ate most of the ice cream but couldn't finish it and packed out my Gatorade. I thought since there was a privy and a spring within .6 of the wayside we'd find a stealth site within that area but we didn't. After a mile and a half with an ascent Eddyman found a spot that would work and we set up our tents in between close trees which is a pain. It was 6:30 when I crawled into bed without dinner. I drank my Gatorade and water and went to sleep. Whatever insects that live in the forest here are they certainly are loud. I fell asleep listening to their steady beat. I'm concerned. I'm feeling so drained and the terrain here is so easy compared to what I've done. I'm disappointed with my body. I'm so much stronger than this. Tomorrow we only have 7 miles to get to Luray and I hope I'm feeling better.","Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603396,"The sunrise this morning as the first beams shown thru the trees was brilliant. I enjoyed my granola and milk from a log near where my tent had been and washed it down with a hot electrolyte. It tasted good and I thought my body could use it. 7.2 miles will bring us to Route 122 and Alison from the Open Arms Hostel in Luray. I was feeling the same as yesterday and I struggled up any incline but held a steady 2 mph on flats and descent. We had one climb today of about 1.2 miles with only a 600' ascent but I felt like I was climbing Mt Washington again. I rested often and walked slowly trying not to raise my heart rate and breathing too much so I wouldn't feel dizzy and ill. Near the end of the ascent Eddyman took my food bag so I could lesson my load. It was helpful and he carried it all the way to the road for me. We only saw one couple walking their dog today and yesterday we saw only 2 sobo hikers. It's very quiet on the trail. 
We arrived at the entrance gate and stopped to get our back country permits. We've been in the park 2 days without them because we came in from Front Royal when the park was closed due to Florence and didn't backtrack to the kiosk to get them. We'd both forgotten until we were miles up the trail yesterday. It was good to get that taken care of. We lounged on the side of Route 211 laying in the grass leaning on our backpacks for a glorious 15 minutes before Alison arrived. She drove us back to her wonderful hostel and gave us the tour introducing us to her 3 cats and getting us settled in. I chose the front room with bunks and I'm the only one in it tonight. It's lovely and private. I showered and put on loaner clothes while Alison did my laundry and then I opened my resupply package and a package Eddyman's wife sent me with some GF baked goods. She's super kind and thoughtful! I haven't been eating much so my food bag looks good but I added a bit to it and shipped out the rest 80 miles ahead. I also sent my water filter, a long sleeve shirt and long johns home. I've switched to Aqua Mira for now. It saves me weight and the upper body workout of the pump. Alison drove us to a diner and I had a cup of soup and 1/2 an omelette. We stopped in at the ice cream place next door but I had to pass. But right now I could eat some and it's too far to walk. I can't wait to finish these antibiotics so I can get myself back. I mean really! I couldn't eat ice cream!?","Stealth site

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603441,"I slept well despite the train across the street that blows it's whistle when it passes. I've heard many trains on the trail and I rather like the sound actually. I waited until 6:10 to get up even though I was awake at 5:30. As I dressed and got ready I was wondering if I should be hiking today feeling so weak and nauseous. I brushed my teeth and warmed up the leftover omelet I couldn't finish yesterday. I managed the potatoes and about 4 bites of the egg before I called it quits. I considered my options and pressured myself mentally because it's not just me it's Eddyman too and we already lost 4 days from hurricane Florence. But then I asked myself if I would go into my office to work feeling this way or out on appointments with clients. The old me would ""suck it up buttercup"" and fake my way to acting like I feel well. But this me wouldn't and thus I had my answer. Something isn't right with me and at 7:10am I decided I wouldn't hike but instead get to a Doctor to see if it's a reaction to the antibiotics or something else. Alison was wonderful and she sent me back to bed while she shuttled another hiker back to trail. When she returned home she made some calls to a clinic and then put me in contact with them. I scheduled for 12:45 and she drove me there. While I was at the doctor she did my mail for me, sending one box home and one up the trail. After some history, a quick exam and a visit with the vampire she picked me back up and drove me to a deli where I got a cup of tomato soup and a small salad. I ate it all and felt selfish that I didn't think to call and ask Eddyman if I could bring him  something. After eating I layed down in my room and updated Brian. My plan is to try to eat more and slack pack tomorrow what we'd planned to do today. I know once I'm really in the mood for ice cream that I'm ready to finish this thing! My mind is there but it's up to my body. The infection could have caused a flare up for me, this fatigue. But these other symptoms aren't what I normally experience. I have to leave it up to the professionals and the test results. Until then eat, rest, walk.","Open Arms Hostel

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603443,"I'm feeling stronger today and looking forward to a slack pack. I was up at 6am and made my way down to the kitchen around 6:15. The coffee wasn't ready yet so I went out on the back porch to tend to my pack and put what I need into my day pack. As with some hostels packs and trail shoes are not allowed inside, and for good reason. If you've ever smelled either on a thru hiker it's not an experience you're soon to forget and who would want multiples of them in their home? Pew! By the flashlight of my phone I transferred my rain coat, tyvek, snacks, water, SPOT and other necessary gear for the day. Then I headed inside to make my oatmeal and grab some now made coffee. It took me 20 minutes to get the oatmeal down and it's my favorite one too, but I still have nausea. It's getting better though. 
Alison drove us to the trail at 7:15 and by 7:30 we were working on the 2 mile climb to Mary's Rock. It was a quiet morning, cooler but still humid. Maybe I just need to get used to that. When we reached the top the view was a wonderful reward. Just one other hiker was sitting up on the rocks. We rested a few minutes and I texted my parents to let them know I'm feeling better. As we walked away the clouds blew in and we continued up trail. The AT skirts the edge of Pinnacle picnic area but the clouds were so thick we could hardly see the tables. We were looking for a snack break as it was 10:30 and there were flush toilets and running water in a building we couldn't see until we nearly walked into it. Eventually with empty bladder and clean hands I joined Eddyman at the nearby picnic pavilion where we could enjoy a dry seat. It's the little things that matter most! Again no one was around ( or perhaps we just couldn't see each other!)
We made our way south and now being 10:45 we started seeing day hikers, many with dogs and met a sobo thruhiker from Boulder CO. The trail was rocky today but in wonderful condition. Our next stop was for lunch around our 10 mile mark at the Skyland Wayside. We were surprised it was sit down dining but we had the time so we indulged. I ate my burger without bread and a small salad. Delicious! I checked my phone and saw a voicemail from the doctor. My test results are normal so we can conclude that the infection caused a flare up and the antibiotics gave me every nasty side effect listed. Also good news is the infection is gone and I will not take any more of the prescription. I can manage my flare up. I texted Alison at the hostel to confirm a pick up time and location. 
We popped out of the woods into a small parking lot next to an overlook turnout on Skyline Drive. While we waited for Alison we watched cars come and go. Some got out, took a picture and hopped back in and drove away. Others rolled up and rolled away without even rolling down a window. It was strange to see this, since we work so hard and appreciate the views so much. We look back at the reward of mountains already summited and forward to those we'll climb tomorrow. It was an interesting perspective. 
On the way back to the hostel Alison stopped at the deli for us and I got a large chilli to go. I ate half, showered and rested and consumed the rest. No nausea! I can't say that I'm looking forward to the burden of my 35ish lb pack tomorrow, but I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the Shenandoah National Park and the next stop in Waynesboro.","Route 211 Thornton Gap

It's going to be hard to leave here where it's warm and dry and drag my wet butt and waterlogged pack up the trail. Eddyman and I sat at the dining room table and discussed options over oatmeal and the weather forecast. Unfortunately it's going to rain every day and we'll be hiking 4.3 days to Waynesboro in it at a 15 mile average per day. We have to do it. At 7:15 Alison drove us out to the overlook where she picked us up yesterday. We hugged goodbye as 2 deer greeted us by the side of the trail. We saw many deer today and they're accustomed to seeing humans so they don't really scurry off. It's nice to watch them and I saw 2 grooming each other. It was beautiful and sweet. We hiked 4 miles and took a side trail to Big Meadows wayside. Colorado was waiting to be seated so we took a table for 3. Galaxy and Songbird were seated already and we hugged, happy to see each other. I ordered breakfast and ate the eggs and hash brown but couldn't eat the ham so I donated it to the others. Insect arrived and joined us and ate an egg breakfast a stack of pancakes and a large cinnamon roll. A true hiker hunger I was envious of! As Eddyman and I left we received bananas from Galaxy and Songbird who had been given a bunch of food by a car camper who was leaving early because of the rain. I enjoyed that banana a little later. It was cold and windy leaving the wayside and it was hard not to turn around and go back inside. We hiked about 7 more miles to Lewis Campground. Insect had called them in the morning and they had some cabins, though they sounded expensive. We saw Colorado in the camp store/office and he and Insect had gotten a cabin to share so he was on his way out with fresh towels. I bought a yogurt and a Starbucks frappachino and inquired about the cabins. They're all rented, a few leftovers to hikers at a discount rate with Colorado getting the last one. If only we were 15 minutes faster. We decided to knock on Colorado's cabin and beg to sleep on the floor. I did the begging and Colorado instantly welcomed us in. When Insect returned with the manager's truck after taking it to Big Meadows to use the ATM we squared away my floor space and she dried out her wet gear in the rest. The cabins are great! 2 bedrooms with a full bath in the middle and hardwood floors. The boys had one and we had the other and they were spacious. They did laundry and included my socks which was very kind. The cabin rental was a super discount at $60 so we each paid $15. It was the best $15 I have ever spent but Insect felt like I should pay less for sleeping on the floor. I would have paid $20! I let her buy me a coffee and she felt better but that meant at 10pm I had been in bed for 2 hours and my eyes were still stuck open. There was caffeine in that there coffee and I made a mental note. No more coffee before bed. But before bed we all ate together in the boys side after hot showers. I bought a pint of milk and a single serve Cheerios for morning and put the milk out on the picnic table to stay cold overnight. It's definitely warm enough in here to spoil it! We've got the heater blasted to dry out Insect's stuff from last night when it poured. Down on the floor it's cooler but I'm right in it's line of fire. We've got almost 20 miles to hike tomorrow and it's difficult with the fatigue and nausea though I feel the fatigue easing. I've learned from Brian's research the side effects of the antibiotics can last 15 days after the last one is taken. I'm stressed. Lord help me!","Rock Spring Cabin parking area

I woke up soaked in sweat and had to dry myself and my quilt out in front of the heater. More an age thing than a room temperature thing. By 7am I had eaten my Cheerios and given the rest of the carton of milk to Insect. Eddyman and I hit the trail. With almost a 20 day in front of us in the rain I was really glad to be feeling less fatigue and nausea. I fluctuated between open rain coat and rolled up sleeves and no hat to bundled up tight. It just depended on the elevation. Our stops were quick because we're wet right thru the rain gear and we cool off quickly. It's only in the low 50's. We had no waysides today, no place to break up the day out of the weather. We stopped for a quick lunch at a shelter and ran into Colorado, Galaxy and Songbird. We're all headed to the same shelter for the night, another 8.2 miles away from here. I hope it's not crowded. We have seen only 5 other hikers today outside of our little group. One section hiker alone and 4 hikers together headed to Lewis Campground and a reserved cabin. The trail was leaf covered soaked and muddy but it's sometimes hard to see the slick spots under the leaves. My hiking poles are worth their weight in gold as I nearly became a mud butt several times but for them. Some of my skids were easily a couple of feet long.  We had 4 sizeable climbs today and when we summited the last one I knew it was 1 mile to the shelter and I booked it. I just wanted to get my wet clothes and shoes off and get dry and warm. When we arrived at the shelter Colorado was there and I claimed the end opposite him while Eddyman and then Insect claimed space in the loft. Before we were set up 4 section hikers arrived and claimed the last loft spot and 3 on the floor leaving 2 spaces for Galaxy and Songbird when they arrived a while later. After dinner Sugar Glider and Pineapple arrived but the shelter was packed and they were forced to set up their tent in the rain. I'm looking forward to tomorrow. 3.7 miles to the wayside and a total of 13 miles to the shelter. I'm hoping we can get dry at the wayside even if just for a little while. More rain all week.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603715,"Well in no way did I get a good night's sleep. The wafting smells of farts and dirty hikers, especially wet socks, only helped to keep my nausea alive all night. I forced down a half portion of white bean chicken chili but the beans weren't quite rehydrated enough and it didn't suit my palate. Twice in the night I scoped out the quick exit so I wouldn't step on Songbird's head if I needed to vomit. Fortunately it never came to that and at 5am I snuck out to pee and then crawled back into bed much relieved to take a nap. Today would be a wet 13 miles to the next shelter but we plan to break it up with breakfast at the wayside in 4 miles. I'm wet and I'm cold and even the inside of my rain coat is wet but I wear it for warmth and pack away my kilt. I ordered 2 eggs over medium with bacon and hash browns, no toast and an orange juice. The eggs are broken and over hard and I'm sure the cook doesn't care. I ate one and 2 of the strips of bacon and the hash browns. Eddyman ate the rest of the bacon. Songbird, Galaxy, Colorado, Insect, Sugar Glider and Pineapple are all there and some of us lingered more than an hour eating multiple breakfasts. It's a shame I can't get just one down. Before leaving I visited the ladies room where Songbird has been using the hand dryer to try to dry her socks and boots to relieve her blistering toes. The stench almost gagged me when I walked in and she was so apologetic. I don't blame her for trying to get relief from the misery but odors are a real trigger for me right now. Determined not to get wetter today I purchased a rain poncho in the gift shop. It covers my upper body and pack. I put it on and we headed out for 9.6 more miles. Sugar Glider and Pineapple decided to walk Skyline Drive instead of the trail in the hopes of staying dryer and making it 26 miles to the Blackrock Hut. Today was probably my most difficult emotional day because of the fatigue and nausea. I worked so hard at pushing my wet stinky self up and down mountains while carrying a 35lb waterlogged backpack. When Eddyman offered to take my food bag to lighten the load I broke down. I explained I'm doing the best I can and he said he knows that and lightening my load may help. Im upset that my body isn't doing what I want. Songbird gave me some ginger capsules for digestive aid. I took 2 and the nausea was better. I was hard on myself for not having a body at this time that will do what I'm asking of it. It made my stomach hurt and I just wanted to get to the shelter and lay down. We arrived around 4:15 and I chose a spot on the floor that would give me easy exit. The floor to one side of me all the way to the wall was wet so no one would likely take it plus the rain stopped a few hours ago and several hikers are tenting. I layed down on my sleeping pad and covered up taking some deep breaths and relaxing before dinner. I then watched Galaxy work on getting a fire going. No easy task and it took him finding some sassafras and one hour of fanning. Finally we had the fire and spread out our socks and shoes near it to dry. But nothing dried. On the other end of the shelter is Pathfinder. She was here when we arrived all wrapped up in an emergency blanket inside her sleeping bag with a hat on. She'd arrived yesterday wet and cold suffering from hypothermia and Insect and Colorado tended to her when they stopped in earlier by making her a hot chocolate and getting water for her. She's been on trail since March 24 and started at Springer Mountain. She skipped the Smokies because she had bronchitis. She fell in GA and required stitches in her head. She confessed to not being able to hang a bear bag or open a bear box. She's 76 and if she were my Mom I'd have gotten her off trail long ago. She's planning on getting off at Harper's Ferry but it'll take her a month to get there at 5 miles a day. Around 6:15 it was feeding time and I was feeling better with the rest. I got my water and cooked up a half portion of cheesy mashed potatoes. I skipped the bacon bits. It was okay and I brushed my teeth and crawled back into bed. Then I received a text from Brian asking me to call. I had to leave the shelter to get enough service and it was nice to talk with him. He just wanted to hear my voice. It made me feel better and it changed my perspective a bit.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603716,"The shelter being less crowded afforded me a better night's sleep. I got up once and peed beside the shelter almost getting caught by Eddyman who got up moments after me to do the same. Then at 5:45 I heard an alarm and I thought it was Eddyman who got up and turned it off so I took it as my cue to get moving. We're planning 13-17 today and I thought we'd get up a little later. As it turned out that was Galaxy and his alarm because he and Songbird are going to go for the 20.7 to get to Waynesboro tonight. I totally blew being able to sleep in a bit! I made some chocolate raspberry oatmeal but decided I couldn't eat it and opted for a protein bar instead, donating my oatmeal to Galaxy and Songbird who enjoyed it. I can't eat anything that doesn't really appeal to me and I'm trying to get as much nutrition and calories in me as possible. Songbird gave me 4 more ginger capsules and I took one right away. 
When we left the shelter we were walking in a misty cloud but soon after the weather cleared and I saw my shadow. I felt for a minute like punxutawney Phil and wondered if we'd have 6 more weeks of rain or if it was really over. Shortly up the trail I heard a rustling to my right and when I looked my eyes met with a bear's and he quickly scrambled down the tree and beat feet into the woods. When I caught up to Eddyman I told him but he hadn't seen it. I dropped back again on a climb only to find him waiting for me at the top. He'd just seen a mother and cub 5' off the trail and they ran off when they saw him. A half hour later Eddyman stopped and backed up on the trail and my first thought was a snake but it was a larger, older bear on the side of the trail. We tapped our trekking poles together and encouraged the bear to move on but he was slow to saunter away, as if he's used to seeing humans and less bothered than the others. It was really nice to see the wildlife out. I'm assuming they don't like playing in the rain any more than we do. We even got to enjoy a couple of views today! I have more energy today and I can eat small amounts of food more often. It was quite warm though, around 80 and humid. We stopped at a parking lot and took our shoes and socks off to dry out in the sun. I started my day with 2 liters of water and I have less than half a liter and another 4 miles to get to the closest spring. The water is 12+ miles apart today. I spoke with a woman from NJ in the lot, telling her the water is far apart for us today and it's quite warm. I could see they had a thermos and a cooler in the car but she never offered anything. I dropped many hints during our conversation. Her husband never spoke a word and they hiked off together after moving their car into the shade. If there's a next time I will just flat out ask if they have any extra water or beverages and I'd be happy to pay for them! When Eddyman and I arrived at the water 4 miles away we almost kneeled in front of it. It's ironic this love hate relationship with water. I've been rained on for 2 weeks and yet I need this water so badly. I filled up both liters and treated them with Aqua Mira. I have to wait 15 minutes before it's safe to drink. I sent my pump home from Open Arms Hostel. It's heavy and it's an upper body workout I'm not interested in anymore. We hiked on up the mountain 1.5 miles toward the shelter. By the time we arrived at the trail to it we had each consumed a liter! We saw Galaxy there who had the same experience but managed to get a can of Dr Pepper from someone in the parking lot which helped them. We filled up and Eddyman filled an extra bladder bag so we'd have plenty of water to stealth camp tonight and hike 6 miles tomorrow morning to town. We continued to climb up this mountain and when we arrived at the top we noticed that the sky was growing darker. As we hiked down to Beagle Gap we began to hear the thunder and see blackening sky. It was 4:45 so we pitched our tents in a meadow behind the parking lot and port-a-potties at Beagle Gap. I felt the drops coming and made sure I was staked down tight as the wind was picking up. Once I had all my gear and myself inside I looked at my phone to see the severe weather warning right upon us. I yelled to Eddyman in his tent just before the sky opened up. Tons of rain and 60 MPH gusts rocked my tent as I lay there staring up at the rainfly thru the screen on the top of my tent. I kept checking the time on my phone telling myself it would be 20 minutes then 15, etc. But it lasted almost 45 minutes. I finally let my breath out and mopped up a few drops where I know I need to seam seal now! With the worst of the storm over Eddyman ventured out to the handicap port-a-potty and made his dinner. The row of 4 units had been cleaned that day and were still wet inside but clean. I opted to dine on my leftover pepperoni and some other items in my tent and then brushed and brought my bear bag over so Eddyman could stow them up on top of the potties. I watched 5 deer at the apple tree in the meadow as I walked back to my tent. It was sweet and peaceful. I climbed into my tent and had a nice call with Brian before rolling over and closing my eyes. Tomorrow we'll hike a short 6 miles to town and take a Nero and a zero.","Blackrock hut

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603717,"It poured off and on all night interrupting my sleep. I was conscious enough to keep my bandana on the tent floor to my left and keep my quilt away from it and dry. Not much water comes in but I need to keep my stuff dry. When I woke around 6 it was still dark so I lay there with my eyes closed listening to the rain and willing it to stop. When I heard Eddyman rustling around in his tent I shouted over that we should wait until the rain lets up to get up and going since we only have 6 miles to town. He agreed on that note and the rain was substantially lighter when we packed up. I took my tent down while inside my rain fly keeping it from getting soaked and when I crawled out from under the fly I couldn't see 10' in front of me. It was incredibly socked in and windy!We convened in the handicap port-a-potty for coffee. I know that sounds terrible but it was out of the wind and cold rain. I dreaded the thought of hiking in this and the forecast shows tomorrow will cloudy with no rain. I suggested that we zero today and slack pack the 6 miles tomorrow. With Eddyman on board I started looking for someone to rescue us from the port-a-potties. Some of the shuttle drivers couldn't get to us for over 2 hours. I called Adam at Stanimals hostel and was honest that we weren't staying with him but needed the shuttle. $25 and 30 minutes later we were in his BMW and on our way to the Quality Inn. By 10am I was showered and drying out my gear. Eddyman and I walked in the rain to the laundromat and then to Tailgate Restaurant for lunch. The rest of the day I spent relaxing, watching TV and napping. At 6pm we walked to Green Leaf restaurant for dinner and I ordered an 8 oz steak of which I ate half and brought the other half to my room for later. Oh, and a GF chocolate cake slice. I Skyped with Brian before I rolled over and went to sleep. It was late when I drifted off, around 11pm.

I got up at 4:30 with diarrhea which persisted. I felt a bit dehydrated so I drank a half liter of electrolytes. At 7am I was kneeling by the toilet ready to vomit but I escaped it. I drank a bit more water and packed up my day bag feeling like things were subsiding. Down in the lobby I scored some GF honey nut Cheerios and an Activia yogurt. I ran back to my room twice for things I'd forgotten, like my poles and fleece before Adam arrived at 8am. At the trail head we met Mia. A sweet little Yoda looking dog with so much love to give. Her humans were cooking breakfast on a grill in the parking lot and Mia was in deep focus just waiting for a sausage. I loved up on her for several minutes and she was more than happy to roll over and give me her belly for the full puppy love effect. I could have stayed all day but instead I used the potty and we headed off across the street and up thru the meadow. Communication towers and old tractor seats were up inside the treeline and we spent 5 minutes in the comfort of those butt moulded tractor seats. With no view we walked on and straddled tons of flowing water today on trail meeting up with a few day hikers. I had one more encounter with the diarrhea and ducked behind a large boulder in time. I'm trying not to be frustrated with my body and give it loving thoughts. It was a decent day and slack packing helps me with the fatigue. It was also a quick 5.5 miles, so a very short day. I'm looking forward to being back in town and more rest. Down at Rockfish Gap Adam had shuttle driver John pick us up. We stopped at Colony motel to pick up our resupply boxes that were there and then back to the Quality Inn. We had lunch at a place called the Purple Foot with a secret garden dining area out back. A total surprise. Then we walked next door to Walmart Market for a couple of items before I left Eddyman at the barber shop and headed to my room for meditation and siesta. I wanted to continue my private relaxation so I ordered GF pizza and caprese salad delivered for dinner and called Trail Angel Kathy for a lift in the morning. I ate the salad and waited to see how it settled before having 2 slices of pizza. I'll pack out the other 2 slices for my lunch tomorrow if I feel up to it.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603920,"I didn't sleep well last night it was very broken and restless. I ate a yogurt and a protein shake for breakfast that I'd bought at Walmart yesterday and went to the lobby just after 7 to meet Eddyman and be ready for Kathy and our 7:15 shuttle. She was right on time and an absolute sweetheart. I grabbed another single serve peanut butter on my way out. It was so delicious yesterday and I'm hoping I'll enjoy it as much today. At Rockfish Gap I offered gas money to Kathy but she refused. She said it was a short shuttle and she was happy to help us. She's in her early 70's I'd guess, still working and eats atomic fireballs for breakfast. I loved our conversation and her personality. We climbed over the guardrail John pointed out yesterday when he picked us up and headed down the trail. It was a pleasant section actually and another day without rain. 5 miles in we stopped at Paul Wolfe shelter and I rested on my tyvek and drank a ginger tea. As we were ready to leave we saw a group of a half dozen day hikers with 3 dogs comically fording the stream. We watched the show from the shelter before chatting with them and heading out ourselves to ford. After the shelter we climbed Humpback Mt. It was switchbacks but it was long and rocky and there were lots of day hikers out. I'm happy to see people out enjoying nature and I chatted with a Mom who was out hiking with her non verbal son who clearly loves hiking. I was really happy for them both that he'd found such an outlet. Coming down the increasingly rocky south side of humpback was taxing on the mind and feet. I was ready to stop and not push myself to a bigger day. We took the blue blaze trail to the picnic area and found a stealth site as advertised on Guthooks comments but we passed it up and continued to the picnic area and restroom. We filled our water and went back up the blue blaze trail towards the stealth site, walking clear thru it and over the stone wall into a picnic site where we set up our tents at the edge of the woods. No one bothered us and before long all the day hikers that were parked there were leaving. Before long it was just us and with the setting sun we crawled into out tents to sleep. In the midst of the owl banter which was beautiful I got up at 10:30 to pee. As I crawled back into my tent by headlamp I heard a car driving thru the picnic area with a loud radio and the boom boom of the base. I quickly shut my lamp off and zipped up in the dark. The car drove past.","Rockfish Gap

Still having issues from the rear but it seems to be better today. I've switched to having soup for dinner. I can manage it well and it's also hydrating. When it was light enough we set out and the terrain was rocky most of the morning. More foot torture to remind me of Pennsylvania which seems so long ago. We met up with River who was hiking nobo on a slack pack and it was great to see her! She told me Wind Eagle was ahead and might camp at Tye River tonight.
 We climbed 3 Ridges Mountain in the George Washington National Forest after stopping at the Maupin Field shelter so I could use the privy. Again there are a ton of day hikers out here and I'm afraid to get caught in the middle of business in the woods. 
We were disappointed with the lack of view because we were socked in by clouds again reminding me of Pennsylvania. On the south side of the mountain we stopped at Harper's Creek shelter for water and proceeded to hike looking for a stealth site which we located next to the Tye River about 2 miles further. Wind Eagle (WE) was there in her hammock! It was nice to see her and we chatted briefly before I set up camp, ate dinner and rolled into my tent for the night hoping the river would sing me to sleep.

I was restless for a couple of hours and finally returned to sleep. At 6 I packed up my tent and had a hot ginger tea and protein bar then made 2 trips into the woods for a cathole. When that was all over I filled up my water and daylight allowed us to hike out. WE followed behind us shortly after. 
The Priest was a 4.5 mile climb to the summit and while it's graded and switchbacked it took me over 5 hours to reach the top. I rested every mile and Eddyman waited for me at the summit. It seamed like we climbed all day but it was more of a constant up and down. Toward the end of the climbing  Eddyman took my food bag ro help me out. We stopped at a shelter for a short break and grabbed our last water for the night at Piney River where there were supposed to be some tent sites. Unfortunately there were none and the area was overgrown with vines and exuded a creapy vibe. We hiked on to the next noted site which was down hill from the trail and marginal. We pressed another half mile out of my already spent body to a forest service road where just to the East we spotted a grassy area that upon closer inspection let to some established sites with room for several tents. Eddyman took the first clearing and I walked in back a little to a nice spot for myself with a log to sit on. It was after 6pm already so we set up camp, made dinner and I crawled into my tent hoping for a better night's sleep. But I had restless legs and feet and a slight headache. I took 2 Advil and split the liter of water I had left into 2 bottles adding electrolytes to one and saving the other for tomorrow morning. It will have to get me thru the first 3.3 miles of hiking before we come to another water source.","Tye River stealth site

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604019,"I woke up at 10:30 pm and drank the rest of the half liter bottle with electrolytes. I had a headache so I took 2 more Advil and went back to sleep until just after midnight when the moon woke me up. It was shining brightly thru the trees and the left side of my tent. I went outside to pee taking in the beauty of the night for a few extra minutes and then I crawled back into my nest hoping to sleep thru until morning. It took me a while to get back to sleep but once I did I didn't awake again until 6pm. I packed up and had a Luna bar for breakfast along with a few sips of water and some dried pineapple chunks. We waited until 7:10 to start hiking so that we could see without headlamps. Today was a 9.7 mile day to route 60 where we'd be going to Buena Vista and Lexington. 
In 3.3 miles we came to the trail that lead us to a spring. It was about .4 off the trail and thru a nice meadow. We dropped our packs down on the trail a bit and carried our bottles down to the spring. It was icy cold and flowing well so we filled up and headed back up towards our packs. I had to duck off the trail toward a campsite and a large rock getting there just in time. When I rejoiined Eddyman at our packs I treated my water and grabbed my electrolytes from my food bag that Eddyman was carrying. I had to wait 15 minutes before I could drink my water and I was very thirsty! We hiked out and across the road and began the ascent of Cole Mt Bald. The first of 3 climbs today and at 3,924'. In 15 minutes exactly I thru my electrolytes into one of my bottles and once dissolved I drank my fill. I counted 100 steps at a time and stopped to rest at each one as needed sometimes making it to 200 or 300 before resting. I kept drinking each time I stopped. The grassy bald at the top was beautiful with views all around. Eddyman was waiting for me and we were joined by 2 section hikers who took our picture for us. We proceeded up to ""the Bald"" at 3,967' and took a break once we reached the summit of Cole Mt at 3,970'. We descended and then climbed up to 4,045' and the summit of Bald Knob. Our last climb of the day. Thank goodness! From here I called for a shuttle and reached Oma who said she could meet us at route 60 at 1pm. I couldn't wait to get down off this mountain. I was feeling so weak and worn out. I texted WE and let her know where we were and because we'd get to the motel ahead of her I asked that she call and have them give me a key when I arrived since we're sharing the room but it's reserved in her name. Eddyman and I arrived at route 60 at 12:50 and to our delight a picnic table! We sat down for not more than 2-3 minutes when Oma arrived. She was interesting and I really enjoyed her company as she drove us to Buena Vista post office for our boxes and then into Lexington to the Howard Johnson Motel. Oma reminds me of Which Way. She has been active as a trail maintainer for years and runs a hostel that is closed this year while they add chickens and an organic garden and a greenhouse so that they have a special place for hikers. When I explained to her I was not feeling well and suffering from fatigue, right away she blurted out my disease. I'm shocked because it's so misunderstood and so isolating as a result. I was just immediately comfortable in her presence. She brought us right to the lobby doors and offered services tomorrow morning if we needed. I got checked into WE's room and Eddyman got his own down the hall. I showered and was suddenly starving, absolutely famished and ""hangry"". I ran my laundry upstairs and Eddyman took over handling that while I took care of Chinese food delivery for us. When it arrived I delivered his to the laundry room and dined alone in the blessed air conditioning in my room. Chow Mein and white rice have never ever tasted so good. I could only eat half and I shared with WE when she arrived shortly after. But she'd also already eaten at Burger King. I guess we were all famished! WE had waited for her taxi in the sun at route 60 for an hour with no water. It's really warm here, in the 80's and I felt badly. After showers, laundry and some rest we played leap frog across the 4 lanes in front of the hotel and dined on Mexican food for dinner. Froggy from Stanimals hostel in Glasgow will be here at 8:30 tomorrow to pick us up and slack pack us 11 miles. We'll be doing as many 11-16 mile slack packs over the next couple of weeks as we can. I need to build up my strength again and work thru the other symptoms. I need my appetite back so I can fuel my work and I need to get rid of the diarrhea. I want to keep moving south but it will take me longer and without my pack the effort is less, allowing me to heal I hope. We agreed on a temp for the AC and both went to sleep.

I got up 3 times for the bathroom and again was plaqued by number 2 issues reapeatedley. I moseyd out to the lobby after 7 and as I suspected there was yogurt for me. Period. I watched Eddyman eat 2 raisin bagels and it was all I could do not to assault him and devour them myself. I wanted a bagel with the primal gutural instinct of a lion wanting red meat. In the 2 years I've been GF this has not happened. It hasn't bothered me but become quite normal not to have bread. But this morning I entered a new world. With just my yogurt fueling me we loaded our packs into the trailblazer when Frog arrived and were shuttled to the trailhead at Route 60. 
I couldn't believe we could descend more after yesterday but we did. All the way to Brown Creek. Today was one of my favorite hikes. Not because we had amazing views or summited high peaks, it was contrary to that. It was for the first half of the hike along the Brown Creek and a stroll through history. This area was home to a crop sharing community in the early 1900's. A community of freed slaves who worked together to form this community growing corn, tobacco and other goods. They lived in simple homes and built a successful community before the land was sold to the Forest service in 1920. It was exciting to think about where things might have been, spying an old stone foundation and imagining where the grist mill was. I thought for hours about what life might have been like in this community. I love history. Toward the later part of the day we had a steady and gradual ascent. Finally we ended at the Punchbowl overlook. We were an hour early for our shuttle. We sat in the sun despite the heat and humidity because the mosquitos seemed less viscous there. I ate the apple I'd smuggled out at breakfast now that I could dispose of the core in a trash can and sat on the curb. Then I called the clinical nutritionist and herbalist who's been treating me since late 2016 and asked about help for my current symptoms and begged for a bagel. After some discussion about my blood test results for food sensitivity and my current status he suggested I not stray from the GF diet as my other symptoms could worsen, such as the pain and inflammation. But I'd decided I was going to give it a try. Frog arrived and before he brought us back to Stanimals hostel in Glasgow we stopped in Buena Vista for gas. Burger King was a half mile away. I put on my best pout and he agreed to stop. I ordered a Whopper with cheese meal and boy that burger was good! I've been accused by others in the vehicle of forgetting to breathe while I ate it. I wasn't impressed with the fries and I understand now what Brian means when he says McDonald's fries are better. At the We picked a 4 bunk room and I settled in on a top bunk to rest a bit and listen to the fireworks in my belly. The mattress not being the most comfortable seemed thin and when I layed on my side it was hard on my hip. I rested and relaxed until Eddyman and WE were showered and then took my turn. I later walked down to Scottos pizza place where I ordered 2 subs to go, then over to the""grocery store"" which sells more plumbing supplies and housewares than food looking for eggs and bagels. I struck out on both and ended up at Dollar General landing a dozen eggs, box of Cheerios and milk. Then I walked back to the hostel in the dark with no sidewalk. Sketchy. I was exhausted so I turned in for the night. I hope I don't fall off this bunk or have issues getting down for the bathroom later.","Route 60 Buena Vista/Lexington

I hadn't realized anyone else was awake. We were leaving for the trail at 7:30 so at 6:30 I dressed and grabbed a bowl of Cheerios. 
The first 2 miles was a climb up Bluff Mt which was steep in sections and I took my time, counting to 100 and stopping as needed. At the top Eddyman was waiting and WE had just left. I spent only a few minutes there looking at the plaque in memory of little Ottie Cline Powell who was found deceased at that spot in the 1890's after wandering away from the schoolhouse 7 miles from there. He was 4yrs 11 months old. It was sad to read and imagine what he went through. There was report of a resident Copperhead in the base of the concrete steps, remnants of an old fire tower but he wasn't out this morning. We hiked on and I felt good knowing this was the last real climbing today. We enjoyed some nice views from the Cliffs where we found WE lounged on the grass and also from Fuller's rock. It was hot and humid but the clear skies were wonderful. We stopped at Salt Log gap for lunch and at Johns Hollow shelter for water and the privy and the 3 of us then hiked out to the James River bridge. We had to apply insect repellent in the parking lot while we waited for Frog or there would have been nothing left of us for him to pick up. I haven't encountered so many mosquitos on this trip as I have here in this section of Virginia. Back at the hostel we dropped our stuff off and Frog gave us a ride to Scottos where we ate and ordered sandwiches for tomorrow and froze in the AC because we were still wet from hiking. Frog returned us to the hostel and it was quiet until about 8pm when River arrived followed by some party hikers. I'm so happy to see River! By 10pm it was quiet again but I wasn't able to sleep. It came intermittently just as it has the past several nights and I climbed up and down the bunks once again. At 2 am I returned to the bunk after a trip to the bathroom only to run right back down to vomit after taking a couple of sips of water. I'm so thirsty and dry. I have some new decisions to make. My health must come first. This flair up is not going to go away if I don't change what I'm doing right now. I need to do the things that helped me thru this in the past.

When I'm able I'll resume hiking wherever we are and for the first couple of days we'll do short miles and I'll rest as much as needed. The section of trail I end up missing I will have to go back and hike before I'm done. I'm good with that and not stressing about it. It will happen and I'm confident that the trail will provide for me at that time. I'm happy with the arrangements because my tramily gets to hike and I don't feel stressed about slowing them down. For now my focus is on wellness. They headed out around 6:30 and I stayed behind.

It was an hour of driving and was all I could take. It was 7pm when we arrived and getting dark. I was so happy to be in Waynesboro and Stanimals hostel here is WAY nicer than the Glasgow location and much larger.

With everything in hand we went back to the hostel and crawled into bed bed just before 9. In the morning we'll leave around 6am and get my tramily back on trail.

At 4am I tossed my water again and at 5am I got up and dressed and went out to McDonald's for breakfast passing WE on her way back. Eddyman and River were still in bed when I left. When I returned after my pancakes I found Glen in the kitchen with pancakes on the griddle for us. Others indulged and I waited for the group to be ready. A bit after 6am we departed. Again the ride to Glasgow was all I could stomach. The guests were still at the hostel so Frog couldn't drop me there. I opted for the park instead seeing the covered pavilion and the nearby gas station with restroom. 
I was so exhausted I just wanted to sleep. Instead I listened to a book on my phone until a local man joined me in the pavilion and we talked for a while. Around 9:30 I put my backpack on and walked up to the hostel. They were still there so I sat at the picnic table at the business next door and listened to my book while watching for Frog. Around 10:30 I saw him and flagged him down.

They'd gotten a ride from someone at the trailhead and I caught Susan just as she was leaving to let her know. We ordered burgers and hung out on the deck until 4pm and our cabin still hadn't been cleaned from last night's guests. I reminded Susan and someone went right over and took care of it. We dined on canned food from the camp store for dinner on the deck of our little cabin and went to bed around 7:30. I had to double dose myself on melatonin again and put the lavender on my pillow. I really need a good night's sleep.","Stanimals Waynesboro

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604237,"The bed was comfortable, the air conditioning just right and I had a great night of sleep. I awoke once around 11:30 and walked to the bathhouse wondering if I'd be able to get back to sleep after but I did. I slept until 6 and awoke feeling refreshed. At 7:30 we all walked down to the store where WE and Eddyman dropped their packs off so I wouldn't have to carry them down later. We waited for Susan who arrived at 8:10 and she drove them to the trailhead. When she came back she opened up the store and made me a breakfast of eggs, sausage, hash browns and homemade biscuit. I ate it all and it was the most I've eaten in one meal in weeks. I took a walk after that but the sun was hot and the fast rising temperature only made me feel ill. I retreated to the shade of the deck for a while and then sought out a shower. At 1pm my shuttle driver Pepper jack arrived. A very nice young man with a nice clean vehicle and good driving skills. I had no anxiety on the way to Daleville and we had great conversation about his recent completion of the trail ( just 6 weeks ago) and our slack packing and shuttle needs for the next few days. He dropped me off at the motel and help me bring the packs in. I checked into our room and layed down for a while. Susan had tucked a fresh homemade biscuit away on top of my pack for me earlier and I ate that in the room. When WE and Eddyman arrived back from their hike they showered and we walked down to the Three Pigs BBQ for dinner. I had just been drinking water and for some reason my belly was bloated and painful. I ate a cup of Brunswick stew and brought a baked potato and asparagus back to the room to eat later when I was feeling better. Just before 9 I brushed my teeth and dosed myself with melatonin and drifted peacefully off to sleep.","Middle Creek campground

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604239,"I slept well in the cool temp of our room getting up at 1am for the bathroom and going right back to sleep. At 6am I heard WE up getting ready. I joined her and Eddyman downstairs for breakfast just after 6:30. After they left at 7:30 I returned to the room and rested a while longer. At 9:40 I had a small bowl of cereal and then walked down to the shopping plaza where the outfitter and Kroger are. Pepper jack had given me his tube of seam sealer but it was clogged up and I couldn't get it to flow freely. The outfitter wasn't open when I arrived even though the hours stated 10am so I enjoyed a raisin bagel with cream cheese next door and read an article on spider webs. You might not think that would relate in any way to Hiking but it does. Every day we are the recipients of faces, arms and legs full of gooey spider webs. The face is where it feels the most disgusting and for that reason we like it when Eddyman goes first. He's the tallest! I'm sure he's not impressed by our urging and to be fair we do sometimes go first but he always gets what our height misses. A few times I've gotten the spider along with the web and it produces a dance move I'm not proud of, as I struggle to wipe the spider off me quickly. The most common one we see is a striped garden spider with colorful long striped legs and body. I don't in any way think they're beautiful. The article I read was regarding the stickiness of the webs and the study of the impact dew may have on it. We hikers voted that yes the dew and our sweat make it stickier. No need to conduct further studies! I texted a picture of the headline to WE, Eddyman and River giving them a chuckle. After my delicious bagel, which I've been dreaming about for days, the outfitter was open and I stopped in. He got me the seam sealer and I also purchased a blaze orange bandana. It's hunting season and we can hear the shots. While it's small game right now it will change soon and blaze orange will be required in some sections of the trail. I stopped at Kroger and got a small bottle of olive oil per River's request and some bone broth for me to sip as well as a Body Armor hydration drink and new gel insoles since I've had mine from Hanover NH and I'm feeling like they're dead now. I headed up towards the hotel for my last errand stopping at the Howard Johnson across the street to pick up our resupply boxes that were mailed there. With my arms full I played another game of frogger across the 4 lane and won a trip safely back to our room. I set up my rainfly in the grass out back of the motel and applied the seam sealer. Again the sun made me feel sick so I retreated to the air conditioned room for a while. Around 1:30 I walked to the Mexican restaurant out front and had a lunch burrito I couldn't finish but it was delicious. Back in our room I layed down and was watching TV when WE arrived before 3pm. Once she and Eddyman were showered we all went back to the Mexican restaurant and I had flan while they are dinner and WE finished my flan for me. River got in at 6pm from her  hike and I went back to the Mexican restaurant with her around 7pm and had a grilled chicken salad. Eddyman joined us mid meal and we all finished up together after which River and I played night frogger across to the convenience store and I picked up Gatorade for WE so she could freeze it for tomorrow. It was almost 9 when WE and I turned the AC cooler and the TV off. I dosed myself with melatonin and said a goodnight to Brian and closed my eyes. 15 minutes later WE and I both were needing it cooler to sleep so I cranked that dial down and drifted off.","Daleville

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604297,"A good habitual sleep cycle is important in my wellness. A lot goes on in the belly that inhibits sleep and the melatonin that is naturally produced by the body is often inhibited in flare ups such as mine. The fact that I'm getting sleep now is step one in getting thru the fatigue and other symptoms of this flare up. Slowly I am improving and taking care not to be too anxious but to listen and observe my body and try to provide what it needs. Last night before I went to sleep I read a few articles on acupuncture and my disease. When I was first diagnosed my doctor suggested I try it. Most patients use it for pain relief but I specifically looked up my digestive issues and acupuncture. There's a Chinese medicine clinic in Roanoke and after discussing it with Brian this morning I called them today and scheduled an appointment for 5:30. I will try anything to end this suffering and get my body back. I did sleep well last night but the nausea has returned this morning. I ate at 6:30 with my tramily, a bowl of cereal, and after their shuttle left I went back to the room and slept until 9. I then had a slice of toast and enjoyed some fresh air outside in the shade on a bench while watching dark clouds rolling by. It was cooler today and a little breeze was blowing. I'm thinking of my tramily and how much nicer today is for hiking. They have a 19+ mile day today and the lessened humidity and heat will be good for them. A little after noon I walked down to the Kroger and picked up a drink for River and a couple for me. Then I headed over to Bojangles for a lunch consisting of a chicken breast, Mac and cheese and coleslaw as well as a biscuit. I had chocolate milk instead of soda. I ate the coleslaw, Mac and cheese and most of the chicken and I wasn't feeling well. So I sat a few minutes and then tossed the remains and walked towards the motel. I walked into our room and began putting the drinks into the refrigerator when I dropped everything in favor of a position on my knees in front of cold porcelain. It splashed all over my shirt and I thought it would never end. When it finally did I had clean up detail having to wash my shirt I'm the sink and dry it with the blow dryer so I'd have it to wear to my appointment. After laying down a bit I suddenly wished I'd packed out that biscuit! Instead I settled for a handful of raspberries I'd bought at Kroger and took in some water. I sure hope this acupuncture works!I had arranged my shuttle with Pepper jack and as usual he was on time and drove me straight to my appointment. I went inside and asked about how long I'd be and reported it back to him and he drove away. I met Mari, a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and licensed acupuncturist. She was affirming, kind and very knowledgeable on my disease and how she might help me. After a good 20-30 minutes of discussion she brought me to a separate room and made me very comfortable. The diffuser pumped lemongrass into the air and soothing music played softly. I wasn't nervous at all even though I hate needles but I did not look at them. I never saw them in me but I felt them there and she was wonderfully calming while administering my treatment. With needles in place she turned out the lights, placed a blanket over me and a heater at the soles of my feet. For an hour I lay perfectly comfortable and motionless. I'd prayed to God to please lay his healing hands upon me and I feel it was him who brought this treatment to the forefront of my mind and guided me here. Thru Mari I feel God is laying his healing hands upon me. When the treatment was over and needles removed we sat at her desk where she'd been busy developing 3 recipes for herbal compounds that could be made into capsules for me. I'm considering that treatment as well. We'll see where this leads me. I have a 2nd treatment scheduled for Thursday and I'm already looking forward to it. It feels like loving kindness to myself. Pepper jack arrived and whisked me back to the hotel and a quick check of my texts lead me to the Pizza hut right next door instead of to my room. I had 2.5 slices of pizza and a cup of soup followed by a brownie back in our room. It was nice to be together the 4 of us. River goes home tomorrow morning for 6 days and when she returns she'll hike north thru the Smokies first before anything else. I'll miss her. We just got back together a few days ago and I haven't even been able to hike with her. My belly felt good so I brushed my teeth and crawled into bed taking my melatonin and saying goodnight to Brian. I'll have breakfast with everyone downstairs tomorrow and give River a hug goodbye. I have the best tramily. I'm truly blessed to have them and they have never lost faith in my ability to get thru this. Their confidence, concern and care for me has been such an integral part of me staying on trail.","Daleville

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604455,"I had a restless and broken night of sleep and got up at 6:30 so I could be downstairs to have breakfast with everyone and say goodbye to River who is flying home for a week to attend some weddings. After breakfast I returned to our room to make sure my day pack and backpack were ready for the day ahead. Pepper Jack picked us up after shuttling River to the airport. We were at the trailhead and hiking shortly after 8:30. It's my fist hike in 6 days. I felt pretty good and was happy to be out there. It rained all day which wasn't a pleasure but the hike itself was easy. At one point I did have to stop and eat a mini muffin that Eddyman packed out from breakfast because I was feeling ill. We arrived at the 4 pines hostel soaked from head to toe and with our feet squishing in our boots. I was happy to see Insect, Craig and Skittles there. We chose our bunks and started the process of getting dry. Without heat and towels this was a chore we couldn't quite manage. Exhausted I layed on my bunk and took an hour nap with dry clothes on, my sleeping tank top and boxers. The hostel is in a 3 bay garage. There are 14 sturdy bunks with comfortable mattresses and no linens. There's no dryer. There are no towels and no loaner clothes. It's a donation based hostel located on a small farm with chickens and guinea hens running around and we're provided farm fresh eggs. There is a refrigerator, electric stove, microwave, coffee maker and toaster oven set up on the work benches that skirt the back and side walls. There are plenty of power strips for charging electronics and several sofas and a table for dining. It was very quiet. After my nap Craig, Insect, Eddyman and WE used the van provided to go to the corner store for dinner and brought me back a cheeseburger and fries and a Root beer. I ate half and saved the rest for later. Later came and I did eat almost all of the leftover. There are 2 cats that come and go thru a cat door. Sylvester and Buddy. I think Buddy rolls in chicken shit because he stinks badly but he's taken a shine to Craig and sits next to him all evening. Sylvester is petite and loving. He climbed up on my bunk for a while and I enjoyed his company. When I crawled into bed for the night he came for a visit again but didn't stay. I didn't sleep well at all being in and out of the bathroom all night and Sylvester jumping on and off my bunk. I had changed my acupuncture appointment to 11:45 tomorrow so that I can be back before WE's wife arrives to pick us all up. We'll take the day off because of the rain and Pepper Jack will shuttle me to my appointment though I'll have to meet him at the store. When he dropped our packs off today the hostel owner Joe was very grumpy and told him he doesn't allow other shuttle drivers on his property. There's no way I want to shuttle with Joe. I'm very comfortable with Pepper Jack and I don't want any additional anxiety right now.","VA route 311

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604456,"I slept extremely poorly last night between Sylvester and the bathroom trips. Even melatonin didn't aid me. We slept in as no one was hiking in the rain. Eddyman made french toast for everyone and I ate 2 pieces. Once I knew that would stay in I took a shower and used my bandana to dry off. And I made a most difficult decision that I know is the right one despite how much it hurts. I stepped outside during a break in the rain and with only sobs coming out of my mouth at first I called Brian. I'm not getting better out here and if I continue depleting myself there's going to be nothing left of me and it'll be harder to get back on trail. I am going to go home and get well. Hopefully I can return shortly and finish my hike. Once I stopped crying and Brian could hear my words he cried too, I could hear it in his voice. He's so proud of my 1,400+ miles and he knows how much this hike means to me but also that I have to have my health. I feel like I have hiked the most difficult and technical miles the Appalachian Trail dishes out and I expected to breeze through the south thoroughly enjoying every step. But the past 4 weeks have been a struggle with my health. The trail has been good to me but this disease has not. I don't want it to win by stealing the things I love most about my life from me. I want to show it that I'm stronger and I'm still in control even though I know I'm not. I've asked Pepper Jack to bring me back to Roanoke after my appointment so I can get a room and book a flight. Once I was done talking with Brian I went back inside and told WE and Eddyman. Eddyman approached me shortly after and said he would go home too. He's not feeling as committed to the trail as he was and he'd like to be at home helping one of his Kenyon sons thru college.I checked flights from Roanoke and Richmond and it was half price from Richmond. We arranged for Pepper Jack to drive us there after my appointment. I was very sad to leave WE. I enjoyed her company and I know she was thrilled to have the experience of hiking partners and now we are all leaving. My acupuncture appointment relaxed me for a while but not long. We stopped at an ATM and McDonald's in the pouring rain and I was soaked clear thru everything on me. I rode in the back seat as Pepper Jack carefully and expertly navigated thru downpours and tornado warnings and dropped us safely in Richmond. But the anxiety put my stomach in knots. We checked into the Holiday inn Express and I layed down in my room for an hour or so with the heat on 75°. At 6:30 I met Eddyman in the lobby and the plan was to go to the Holiday Inn next door for dinner. But when I stepped out under the awning and saw the high winds and torrent of rain I told him I wasn't going. I'm dry now and I'm not going to get soaked and then freeze in an air conditioned restaurant. I went back inside and he followed. We decided on Chinese delivery and he waited in the lobby then delivered mine to my room when it arrived. I ate my eggroll and tasted the Chow Mein then stuck it in the fridge. I could try again later. But that didn't happen. The hotel went dark and the generator came on but 2 hours later we were dark and it stayed that way all night. The call came in at 2am from American airlines that my flight was cancelled and I was rebooked for Saturday morning. I went back to sleep in the quiet and dark with the hum of the neighboring Holiday Inn generator running.","4 pines hostel route 624

His was cancelled too but not rebooked. I'm staying here I explained and I'll fly out tomorrow. I'd already looked at my options and the best one was to just leave tomorrow morning. At 5:30 I grabbed my headlamp and wandered down the hall and the 4 flights of stairs in search of a bagel. There were none out. I returned to my bed for more rest and at 8am was successful in the pursuit. I enjoyed the bagel in the lobby while the hotel manager had a meeting with the housekeeping staff to discuss what can and should be done in the dark. She was headed out to assess nearby damage because Virginia power couldn't give her an ETA on restoration. I waited in my room until 10am and then started calling hotels to see who did have power and a room. I scored one at Candlewood suites and booked it with early check-in. I departed the Holiday inn Express and with my backpack on walked the busy road .6 to my new home away for the night. I'm not in a trail town so the looks were quite different from what I'm used to. I'm certain for that walk I was homeless to everyone that passed by and not an AT hiker. I was well greeted at Candlewood suites, checked in and arranged my shuttle for 5:15am tomorrow for the airport. I settled in and relaxed most of the day getting my laundry done and food delivered from Panera that would last me all day. Mac and cheese and tomato soup. Delicious.

My shuttle driver was there to greet me and I was inside the airport getting checked in by 5:30. I bundled and tied down the straps on my pack as best I could and sent it off in checked baggage. I headed to my gate and once I located it I backtracked to Carabu Coffee for a raisin bagel with cream cheese. It was dry and chewy, like a potential choking hazard terrible. I ate some and threw the rest away and drank my apple juice. We boarded the plane heading to Charlotte NC where I'd have an hour to make a connection. I had some ginger ale in flight and stowed the cookie for Brian later. It was a quick up and down landing on time. In Charlotte I changed terminals and once again when I located my gate I backtracked to Einstein bagels for an actually edible raisin bagel with cream cheese. It was delicious and I ate just over half in flight. Some anxiety set in so I plugged my ears with the orange earbuds connected to my MP3 player and listened to country music with the other side of it plugged into the charging block I also had in my day pack carry-on. It was a good distraction and when we arrived at Manchester I made my way to the restroom first. As soon as I arrived at baggage claim I saw my backpack going around and scurried to grab it before it disappeared beyond the wall. I texted Brian in the cell phone lot and within 2 minutes he was in front of me with outstretched arms. It was wonderfully comforting to be enveloped in them and we went straight home. The knots in my stomach started melting away on the drive. At home I rested and hydrated and he made me small bits of food that appealed to me. We talked about tomorrow being Sunday and homemade soup and bread. We found ourselves at the grocery store picking up the necessary ingredients and looking forward to the next day together. Back on the sofa I settled in with a blanket watching the Red Sox game before drifting off to sleep and waking up just before midnight to watch the last inning.

Brian tended to me daily for the first week when I was so weak that I'd have to rest on the bed between showering and drying my hair. He endlessly filled my desires for craved foods usual to me but requested by my body and together we filled it's needs one spoon at a time. Day by day I gained strength and ate more, walked with him (when I had the strength and the rain stopped). I worked at the office part time over the last couple of weeks and helped him cut back the gardens at the office for winter alternating with 6 mile walks from home to office and back. Doing more each day. I regained my strength and after losing another 2.5 lbs my 1st week home I've gained them back. I've changed some of my supplements, some temporary and some permanent. I said a final fairwell to my beautiful cousin of just 54 years young and taken from us so quickly. And another final fairwell to a friend of just 60 who struggled for years with a heart condition. I'm glad I was home for them and I renewed my spirit in the company of loved ones both family and friends. There were so many people I didn't get to see this trip home but I'll see them soon. Yesterday our cat Billy was very Ill. Being an insulin dependent diabetic his condition required our full attention and overnight we took turns checking on him. He spent almost 2 hours at the vet today with Brian while I made sure I had all my gear in order. Yes, that's right. I'm flying out this afternoon and I'll be back on trail tomorrow. I'm excited but it was harder to leave Brian this time knowing he has extra burdens to shoulder with Billy's medical needs. And of course if it snows I won't be there to shovel for him when he plows. But he left me at the airport with a tight squeeze and a huge smile on his face. He understands me. He understands this is that important to me. What an amazing man!I've watched the sun dance on the last color hanging by threads from the trees as we pass by on the highway, looking at the rolling hills and how small they look compared to what I've climbed. I longed to be back on trail with the ground pounding beneath my feet and the scents of the forest. Today I watched the last of the oak leaves give up and let go in the wind. As we became cloaked in the gray November sky which spit snow in an attempt to remind me what I'll be missing I day dreamed of sunny skies that hopefully will greet me in North Carolina. I'll be meeting WE and her wife at the airport tonight. They have a camper and Lee is slackpacking WE all she can and I'm fortunate enough to be included. I'm looking forward to a soak in Hot Springs and summiting Springer Mountain with WE. It will leave me a section from James River to wherever I start up with WE tomorrow and what I can't finish this calendar year I will finish before April 30, 2019 to claim my thru hiker title, God willing. So they're calling us to board now.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605281,"My flight to Asheville NC was wonderful. For the first time ever I chatted with the stranger next to me for the entire leg into Charlotte. A nice man named Terry who moved to Asheville 6 years ago but has a brother and his Mom in Keene NH. I grabbed some Panda Express in between flights for my dinner. When we landed in Asheville I called Judy at Lightheart Gear. I have a rain skirt I purchased from her that isn't keeping me dry. I called Judy early in the week to see what I could treat it with. She was disappointed that it wasn't functioning properly and offered to meet me at the airport to exchange it for me. Amazing customer service! By the time I deplaned and got my backpack from baggage claim Judy was out front. A very kind woman and it was such a pleasure to meet her. I absolutey love the hiking skirts I have from her and I've  sold a few for her as I've been a walking advertisement for them on the trail.  We exchanged the rain skirts and she offered to take me in for the night which was so kind. But WE and Leeanne were waiting around the corner for my text message so they could take me back to Hot Springs NC where they had the camper. 
It was about an hour ride back to Hot Springs and a little after 11pm when we crawled into bed. They had my bed all made up for me and I was instantly comfortable. They were getting up at 3:45am to drive to the trail so WE could hike the 20 miles she was supposed to hike today. She did hike today, after getting up at 3am but walked the wrong direction on the trail. As the sun rose she realized it was on the wrong side of her, and thus she hiked the 9 miles that we planned to hike together. I'm sure she cussed herself out for getting up so early to hike only 4 hours! I slept until 8am after having some trouble sleeping. After breakfast I chose a shorter hike that WE had already done and Leeanne dropped me off at the trail at 10am. I walked back into Hot Springs, along the French Broad River and right to the camper, about 6.6 miles. The hike was fabulous! It was easy with small ups and downs in sunshine and wonderful temps in the upper 40's and low 50's. I smiled. It felt so good to be back on the trail working toward my goal. It was lunch time when I got back to the camper so I made a turkey sandwich and after I ate I opted for another 5.9 mile section on the other side of town. Leeanne dropped me off and once again I walked back into town and to the camper. What a cute little community Hot Springs is. A few restaurants, an Outfitter, a Hot Spring where you can soak in a tub of natural hot mineral water and some other assorted businesses all within walking distance. I stopped at the Laughing Heart Hostel to say hello to Insect who was there taking a zero day. It was great to see her. At the camper I settled in, showered and when Leeanne arrived back after picking WE up we went to the tavern in town for dinner. I can't believe how much I ate. It's like my hiker hunger was on pause and I hit the reset button with my 1st day of hiking! I even had ice cream for dinner....but not a whole pint! WE and Leanne had quite the adventure today. On only 3 hours of sleep Leanne couldn't find the pickup spot or plan B pickup spot they'd agreed upon after GPS wrongly directed her and the sign for the hostel didn't seem clear. GPS told her to park and walk a mile. So with the 2 dogs she set out walking. Meanwhile WE was already at the hostel which was plan B pickup and the hostel owner drove her to where she thought Leanne might have ended up parking after not getting a response from Leanne by phone. The car was there but Leanne was a mile up the trail by the time WE found her, walking in Crocks with sundown nipping at her heals. WE took the dogs and ran back to get the car while Leanne hiked at shorter route to the road. WE tripped and fell, losing the keys temporarily and one of the dogs ran off scared by his retractable leash that was following him. She eventually found the keys and caught up with little Speck and saved him from his leash and rescued Leanne from her 1.6 mile hike in Crocks. Day 2 of WE calamity! I just have to laugh at the thought of it all playing out as poor little Speck runs away from the leash he's dragging!Tomorrow calls for rain and we have an 8.4 mile hike planned.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605292,"It rained all night and was raining when we woke up. We'd decided last night that we'd get some waterproof gloves or rain mitts at the outfitter when they opened at 9 and head to the trail after since we were only hiking 8.4 miles. I would have preferred rain mitts to wear over my convertible fleece mittens but they didn't have any so I settled on a lightweight pair of waterproof gloves. I also picked up a lighter and fuel can since I couldn't bring any on the plane. We bundled up and headed down the trail when Lee (Leanne prefers Lee) dropped us off. The temp was 36° when we exited the car at 10am. The hike was an immediate climb, the rain steady and the trail soggy and slippery. Mud slid under wet leaves as I stepped on them leaving me on guard as I hiked. So far my rain jacket and rain kilt were keeping me dry. We steadily climbed for the first hour gaining quite a bit of elevation and reached a ridge. At this point the wind joined the rain coming sharply from the left and the temperature had dropped. The rain became stinging sleet and my kilt kept blowing open allowing my skirt to get wet. I stopped and took off my ""not so waterproof gloves"", adjusted the kilt opening to my right side and twisted the hood of my rain jacket so it covered most of the left side of my face. At this point I put my soaked gloves back on and realized I was very cold. There was a shelter a mile or so ahead and I hoped it was right on the trail and not down a blue blaze. My wish came true and I saw the shelter with a tarp enclosing the front and a few pairs of trekking poles leaning alongside so I knew it was inhabited. I stepped inside behind the tarp and found WE who was adding some dry layers and assessing her level of comfort and dryness. Also, huddled into their sleeping bags were 3 young men also thru hikers. They were too cold to continue and were warming up and debating whether to stay or make the 11 miles into town and the Laughing Heart Hostel. They called WE and I ""badass"" for being out there. But we were wet and cold and doing our own assessment. I threw an additional layer on under my rain jacket which was wet inside as well as out and my fleece mittens on top of the soaked ""not so waterproof"" gloves to try to get my fingers warm. We had 5+ miles left. The boys decided to get dressed and make a run for it. They're young and can keep a 3mph pace. I said goodbye and headed out after WE, catching up with her a few tenths of a mile ahead. We spoke briefly about getting picked up in 2 miles at Hurricane Gap instead of the agreed spot. She sent a text message out to Lee and I hiked ahead to keep moving and warm up.  I arrived at the Gap and WE right behind me but she hadn't heard from Lee. A quick look at her phone revealed that she'd mistakenly texted Insect! After a bit of a debacle she finally reached Lee who was 30 minutes away and headed for us. We took shelter from the wind behind a small knoll and it was a life saver just to be spared from that. I turned around to see WE with nothing on top and I thought about the stages of hypothermia. Thankfully she was just taking off wet layers and putting on dry....all the while standing in swale filled with water at the base of the knoll and not realizing it. After all our feet were already soaked. We moved in place and half-heartedly sang warm weather songs like the ""Pina colada song"" and discussed options if Lee couldn't find us. The boys from the shelter went flying by and 40 minutes later Lee arrived. It was scary indeed and hypothermia is a really serious consideration in these conditions. As we warmed up on the ride home we agreed to some things for future safely. If we can't stay dry we can't stay alive in cold temps. We will carry a stove and bottles so we can heat water if needed. We will not hike in rain with such temps and wind combined again. At the camper we showered and warmed. Then we went to the outfitter and WE bought better rain gear before stopping at the hostel to do laundry. We visited with Insect and laughed about her reaction when she received the emergency text messages WE sent her in error. We also saw the 3 boys had made it safely and were getting warm and dry also. Insect made her dinner and shared some Pillsbury cinnamon rolls with us before we left with our clean dry clothes. It was quite a day. The GPS didn't send Lee to the right spot for us, but she had observed a road the day before when she dropped me off for my hike and took a chance that it would bring her to us and she was right. After burgers back at the camper I was exhausted! Tomorrow we'll hike the 3.4 we didn't finish today and then we'll move the camper up to Elizabethton TN where we will slack pack out of for the next week or so.","Tanyard Gap
",Hurricane Gap,"Nov 12, Mon",5.50
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605301,"What a difference a day makes! Lee made us pancakes for breakfast (I was delighted to have real maple syrup!) and after cleanup brought us out to Hurricane Gap to finish the hike from yesterday. We decided last night to move the camper up to Elizabethton TN a day early since it was still raining and our hike would only take an hour and a half. Lee waited for us at the parking area at Tanyard Gap and we hopped in. The hike was short and sweet a walk in the misty clouds with dripping trees. Not a true test of WE's new rain gear. 
Back at the camper we both showered and had lunch. I left my watch on top of the plastic bin of dry towels next to the toilet and I realized it while I was eating my sandwich intending to grab it after. But after lunch we packed up the camper to move it and during the festivities WE accidentally flushed my watch down into the black water tank. Mind you, it's a $35 watch so I wasn't distraught over it but just the same an attempt to retrieve it was valiantly made by WE who had already drained and flushed the tank with gray water. So she and Lee together worked for 20 minutes flushing more water into the tank from inside while WE watched outside for it to appear. All the while I'm pondering the idea of ever being able to wear this thing again. It was amazing how much poop was still in the tank after the initial empty and flush. I was relieved when their efforts produced no watch! May it live forever in the depths of the black water tank! I don't know what I would have done if they had recovered it!We hooked up and drove to our next campsite stopping for groceries along the way since we didn't know yet what would be offered close to our new home. We arrived at a pull thru site in a mostly permanently rented campground on the Watuga River and set up close to the bathhouse and laundry both sparkling clean and modern. I walked the dogs while they set up the camper. WE cooked some chicken breasts outside on the George Forman grill while Lee and I fixed the sides inside. Lee is a vegetarian and no meat is cooked inside the camper but the little grill is quick and efficient. I've been borrowing WE's Crocks to wear around since I didn't bring my camp shoes with me. To my surprise they're actually quite comfortable. We're about 2 miles to Walmart and a host of other stores and conveniences so after dinner Lee drove me to the shoe store and Walmart. I scored a pair of Crocks and a new watch exactly like my old one. Same color and everything, (minus the poop!) and I don't need a lesson on how to work or set it. Score!Tomorrow we've got a long drive to the trail head so it's a 5am wake up and a 13.5 mile hike over 5,000' in elevation. It's rest time.","Hurricane Gap
",Tanyard Gap,"Nov 13, Tue",3.40
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605304,"I heard WE's alarm at 5am but I didn't want to believe it. I layed in denial for a minute before getting up and going through the morning routine of stripping down my bed area and remaking it into the dinette. Inconvenient yes, but complaining? No. I'd much rather have to do that for the convenience of a warm dry place to sleep every night than to sleep outside in the cold wet weather! We left at 5:45 after making some sandwiches to pack for our lunch. Another luxury! We swung through the drive thru at McDonald's for breakfast and I ate a McMuffin, hash browns, orange juice and a decaf coffee. The ride to the trail was 50 minutes with the last 20 being in increasing elevation with dense fog. At the trail head we donned our rain gear and verified the southern direction of the trail before embarking. The first 1,000' climb brought us to High Rocks and we would see thru the bare trees the mountains and valleys below, some covered in a thin layer of white. As we climbed the next 1,000' to Little Bald mountain we passed thru a splendidly enchanted looking forest with feathered ice coating every branch and twig. I could have stayed all day there entranced by the uniquely formed frozen moisture and wondering how it came to be that way. I've never seen anything like that but I've seen plenty of frozen and ice coated trees. It was beautiful to walk thru this.A little further up before the summit of Little Bald the temperature rose slightly above freezing and the trees began to rain ice upon us. Sharp little buggers that laid in a heap on the trail and felt like a bed of marbles. Slippery, it felt like each step was a foot gained forward and a few inches lost sliding backwards. I'd hoped that once we reached the summit and the south side of the mountain the slippery slope would disappear. Thankfully it did and we didn't have to exercise our superb butt sliding skills! A half mile from the summit we stopped at Bald mountain shelter and ate our sandwiches on a quick 10-15 minute stop. Neither of us wanted to cool off much since we still had more climbing and another 7.7 miles to go with the threat of rain after 1pm. It was the first time I had seen bear cables though, so WE gave me a quick lesson on them. The shelter was filthy and there was no broom there unfortunately. 500' more feet of elevation over 1.2 miles brought us to the summit if Big Bald mountain at elevation 5,505'. A large grassy bald had us discussing the drastic difference between the mountains here and in NH. Some signage explained that this bald is used by raptor experts and volunteer groups to trap, band and release raptors during migration to evaluate their population and migratory habits. Being past season no one was there but this grassy bald seemed to meander along for about a mile in the a clouds. It was peaceful. A diverse day in the mountains. Around 12:30 it began to rain and by 1pm we were in full coverage rain gear as the trail meandered around mountain sides in an S-curve pattern that hugged the hills with deep valleys to the immediate left side of the trail. I lagged behind a couple of times making clothing adjustments. I'd caught up with WE but with the noise of sloshing, the rain on her hood and the rubbing of the hood against her head she didn't hear me. I was very close when she abruptly stopped and looked to her left at the trail across the valley for me. Just as I began to say ""I'm right here"" she caught me out of the corner of her eye and startled. I laughed so hard I almost peed myself and all she could say after she stopped laughing is that she now couldn't remember what number bottle of beer she was on in her head, singing 99 bottles of beer on the wall. Her own source of mental entertainment while hiking. The look on her face when she jumped was my entertainment for the rest of the hike down to Sam's Gap. At the Gap Lee was waiting for us and we stripped off our rain gear, grabbed a drink from the back and settled in for a rainy ride back. The winter berries and fencing at the parking area were stunning and I took some photos. Mother nature showed off diversity today and despite the rain it was a wonderful walk in the woods!At the campground I enjoyed showering at the bathhouse. It's set up as 2 very large and private 3/4 bathrooms with step in tile showers and they are the cleanest and nicest I've ever seen at a campground. Because we brought a bit of mud back on us Lee was very happy to let us know we should enjoy our showers over there instead of the camper, which I'd planned on anyway. The camper doesn't have much hot water but in the bathhouse I could linger until my bones were warm, and I did. After a dinner of hot soup and a bagel I walked the dogs. It's harder than I thought to walk 2 little dogs at the same time. I brought a flashlight so I could better locate their poops after but little did I know that they would outstretch my arms in opposite directions and both poop at the same time! I was looking left to right and left again to try to remember where they dropped their little tootsie rolls so I could find them and pick them up. So while I was doing that the little buggers wrapped their leashes around trash cans, posts, my legs and anything else in the area. I finally recovered their nuggets and unwrapped us all and headed back to the camper. Me having passed the test, Romeo curled up in my bed under the blanket and stayed the night. Tomorrow we will take the day off due to the rain, snow and cold moving thru. WE made an appointment for a chiropractor visit to see about some relief from the sciatic pain she's having.","Spivey Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605330,We slept in today getting up after 8am. Lee made hash browns and eggs for breakfast and then I went to the laundry room at the campground and did a load of our hiking clothes. It took 3 cycles in the dryer to get the load dry. A ridiculously long time. It was after lunch when I returned to the camper so I made a sandwich and then we played a card game at which I lost. We then went to the movies in Johnson City and saw the Grinch. It was pretty good and the popcorn was great! On the way home we stopped at Walmart for a few groceries. The refrigerator is small so we shop frequently. We got a cooked rotisserie chicken and had it with a kale salad. It was a nice relaxing yet rainy day off. Tomorrow is a 19.5 mile day and we'll be leaving early so I made my sandwich for lunch and placed it in the fridge. Otherwise my bag is ready and we're expecting snow in the mountains. Brian worked to get his plow on and ready. I feel badly that I won't be there to shovel all the walkways and fire escapes for him. He's been so supportive of my journey. I hope one day I can do for him what he's done for me.,"

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605376,"There was a fresh coating of snow on the ground when we arrived at the trail head at 6:35 just before sunrise. I was fueled with an egg McMuffin, hash browns and orange juice from McDonald's and ready to go. I stepped onto the trail and passed a sign confirming our hike today would be 19.5 miles and the forest was immediately beautiful around me. Crisp white snow was sprinkled on every tree and plant. The trail was defined by it. It was a chilly 24° but I was warm in my layers. We started the day with an ascent and as it progressed I found myself changing layers frequently. Largly it depended on what side of the mountain I was on as to wether or not I was putting layers on or taking them off. 
We stopped at 2 shelters today, both right on trail. At the No Business Knob shelter we made hot chocolate and I had a snack. It was around 10am. WE ate her sandwich but I was holding out. 5 miles later we hiked down a hill and into Erwin TN by the Nolichucky River. On the way we saw 2 hunters out looking for their bear dogs which had run off after a bear in NC towards TN. We stopped at the popular Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel at the bottom of the hill. The day had warmed nicely and the sun was shining so I enjoyed my sandwich on the deck at a sunny picnic table while WE enjoyed her snack and a Pepsi from the machine. Attached to Uncle Johnny's is a small outfitter. I got my passport stamped and purchased a nalgene bottle because I'd dropped my sport top bottle at the shelter and being so cold it broke. I haven't been carrying the smart water bottles I used to because the mouth is small and if I have to refill in the cold I may have to get my hands wet which could be a bad thing. So I was carrying 2 sport top 20oz wider mouth bottles from EMS.  After we lingered a few minutes I filled my water at the sink, used the warm restroom and we headed off across the river and railroad tracks and back into the woods. It was different on this side of the mountain, warmer and with little snow. The mud appeared under the leaves again, or should I say hid under them. It took me by surprise and I went down with a thud whacking my right forearm on a rock and my right thigh on a root. Ouch! I stood and brushed off and when I caught up to WE reported my misfortune. We stopped again for a break at Curly Maple shelter, just long enough to eat a Luna bar and pee. From here the trail conditions became difficult. Being on the dark side of the mountain we encountered snow and ice where this time it was WE who went down. I heard the noise behind me and backtracked to be sure she was okay. She was sitting on the trail head dowsed in snow but with no visible injury and so I burst out laughing. I couldn't stop! Until she told me she'd hit her face on a rock and was afraid her nose was bleeding. Then I looked closely and still not seeing injury I laughed again. It's not really funny to fall. Injury can be severe but aside from bruised bodies we both escaped. I was tired and silly. We were both a bit silly for the rest of the hike making up a story about WE tripping me and in retaliation me punching her in the nose. When we got to the trail head where Lee was waiting we pretended to be mad and acted out or little skit as a gag for Lee. I did surprisingly well but WE couldn't hold back her laughter and when I looked at her I blew it but not before we had Lee in full belief. It was good fun but Lee vows to get us back when we least expect. At the camper Lee ran out for propane while WE and I took turns watching the dogs e taking showers at the bathhouse. WE cooked burgers for dinner and it was lights out soon after. It was a long day and I hope I sleep well because it's a 16 mile day tomorrow over Roan mountain. I spoke with Brian and our cat Billy still isn't well but after another trip to the vet and some more hydration he's improving.","Spivey Gap
",Indian Grave Gap,"Nov 16, Fri",19.50
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605379,"The alarm went off at 5am despite the fact that I hadn't slept well. I was stuffy all night and had a bit of a sore throat to go with it.  Lee made us scrambled eggs with cheese and toast for breakfast and we made our sandwiches for lunch. We headed out to Carver's Gap about 45 minutes away and would be hiking south to Iron mountain Gap for 16 miles. But we arrived late at Carver's Gap compliments of GPS which took us on some back roads so remote that the road itself ended after turning into something you might ride an ATV on. Once we got turned around and out of there safely we were able to use the Google maps on my phone and a paper map to get us out to the Gap. 
It was an icy start and we both put on our microspikes but the forest was beautiful cloaked in ice with the sun's rays slipping thru the cracks and lighting it up like a blaze. Sun glinted off ice encapsulated brush growing in clearings and on the sides of the trail as well as icicles dangling from the conifers. Stone steps were encapsulated. I breathed in the fresh scent of balsam and thought of Brian. It's his favorite and I wish we were sharing this moment together. On the other side of Roan mountain with its elevation over 6,200'  the sun warmed the snow and ice and I was able to remove the microspikes. The first half of the hike was wonderful. There were no shelters in a good spot for us today. We had our lunch and hot chocolate while standing in a turnout at the side of a road we crossed as we watched a hostel vehicle drop off 2 section hikers. There were lots of small ascents of 300-500' and they were abrupt and steep. I was more tired at the end of the day today than I was yesterday when I hiked more miles. I think the lack of sleep, this cold coming on and having not been able to sit down and take a break were all factors. The last few miles were arduous with a lot of leaf covered slippery mud. I was so happy to see Lee parked there at the end of the day. I was unloading my pack into the back of the SUV and retrieving the Naked Juice she'd brought for me when I requested that we have pizza for dinner. It was unanimous and after a hot shower we headed to a small pizza place with great online reviews. The appearance of the establishment was a disappointment. It was a bit unorganized and disheveled because they'd had a water leak they were dealing with but I could tell that there was room for improvement despite that. But we were optimistic about the food and it was pretty good. I had a small ceasar salad and NY thin crust pizza. The salad was excellent with fresh ceasar dressing and homemade croutons. The pizza ingredients were fresh but the crust soggy instead of crisp. I ate most of it and took the remaining 3 slices home for lunch tomorrow. My sinuses continued to disappoint me and after finishing my pint of chocolate therapy ice cream I dosed myself with NyQuil. I'm hoping I can get a solid night of sleep! Today Lee made us reservations for Thanksgiving dinner at a local restaurant. I'll miss my family but it will be nice to share a traditional meal with Lee and WE on that day and I will hopefully Skype with my family.","Carver's Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605392,"It was another 5am wake up and Lee cooked us eggs and toast before driving us to the top of Carver's Gap, this time without the crazy GPS detour thru banjo-land! The sun was just coming up and we headed north over 3 grassy balds at a very slow pace enjoying the sunrise and mountain views. I couldn't stop taking photos. I didn't want to hike I just wanted to stand there in awe as the sun lit up the mountainside. God's paintbrush working right in front of my eyes. Some hikers had camped out last night and were getting up and breaking camp. We saw a group of 5 or so young people wrapped in blankets clearly up there for the sunrise and I noticed 2 dogs near them with radio collars like hunting dogs sometimes have. I assumed the dogs were with them until I heard someone say ""hey guys did you see those dogs"" and realized I was wrong. Then I noticed a couple in matching gray sweaters walk by and the dogs followed them so I thought they were the owners. As we passed the couple they asked if the dogs belonged to us and I instantly thought of the hunters we saw in Erwin and that these may be his lost dogs. We stayed with the couple a few minutes and although the young woman was concerned about her car getting ""doggy"" they agreed to see the dogs to their owners and left voicemail on both of the numbers provided on the dogs collars. WE and I resumed our northward motion and after a few more photos and a mile or so we bumped into 2 weekend hikers with a dog who had just packed up and were heading to the parking lot. And behind us appeared the 2 coon hounds without the young couple who promised to see them to their owners. The female still had a strap attached to her collar that WE had sacrificed off her pack. This couple with their beautiful golden retriever agreed to take the dogs and connect with the owners once they got to the parking lot and charged their phone. All day long I thought about those dogs and how cold, trembling and hungry they were and how disappointed I was with that first couple. I hope the dogs are safe and warm and fed now. I do believe that the couple with the golden retriever would have more compassion for animals than the woman concerned about her car. But why say that you'll care for something in need and then just abandon them? I can't reason with that. 
Today was one of my favorite days on trail. I'm really fond of Tennessee. The scenery went for miles and the weather was perfect for climbing over grassy balds and being exposed. I stripped down to 2 lightweight long sleeve shirts and put away my hat, mittens, neck warmer, fleece, etc. We came upon Stan Murray shelter and a group of section hikers who'd set up their tent inside the shelter. This always ticks me off. I noticed that the picnic table was at least 100' from it and soaked in sunlight so WE and I enjoyed our hot chocolate and snack there. Lee had gotten fresh apples and I ate mine. Do you ever wonder what a hiker thinks about all day in the woods? Random things actually, like why does my nose produce so much snot when I hike in the cold, where do spiders go in the winter, and wouldn't a shot of schnapps be good in this hot cocoa? Well I did look up the first 2 and the answers are informative and thus have added to my knowledge which I think is always good. We climbed up Little Hump mountain which actually isn't so little and the climbing was not very steep but the thawing Tennessee mud was another story. JET BLACK slippery mud that is out to take down any hiker that dares to step in it is what we hiked thru for miles. I have no idea how I managed to stay upright because I slipped and slid off the trail time and again somehow reclaiming my balance from the most unusual positions. I went down just once sacrificing only my left knee to the mud with my right leg outstretched behind me and trekking poles firmly planted in the mud near my hips. I used my upper body strength and brought my right leg forward to get my feet underneath me and to a standing position. WE was less fortunate and sacrificed herself twice to the mud soiling her left side and hands the first time. The second sacrifice came at a fence up on a bald. I didn't see her go down I just saw her at the fence on her knees with her pants covered in mud on the thighs. After we both stopped laughing I did all I could for her which was to offer my snot soaked paper towel so she could wipe off some of the mud. It's a disgusting thought I know but she was grateful and I would have been too. I am not convinced that there is anything slicker than that Tennessee mud! Not even baby powder on a marble floor! We had lunch on a rock near the top of Little Hump mountain and enjoyed the warm sunshine and the amazing view looking back over much of the terrain we'd hiked. It's incredible sometimes to think about how many miles I've hiked, each one having it's differences. We further endured the mud over Hump mountain but at least there were areas of grass on the side we could at times walk on to avoid it, unlike Little Hump which only had thorny growth on the side of the trail that grabbed and snagged my clothes if I got too close. On the backside of Hump mountain the snow and ice mixed with the thawing mud and WE put on her microspikes for a few miles not wanting to take any chances of a fall. Once we got thru those areas the last 5 miles became unremarkable trail of dry brown leaves and steady descent to a small bridge in a Gap near the parking area where Lee was waiting. Our feet were covered in dry mud, mine right up and over my gators and up the inside calf of my leggings from my feet touching them as I walked and slid. We were a sight. At the camper we left our shoes outside and gathered up our shower items as well as the requirements for the laundry and headed to the bathhouse. We showered and I threw our laundry in and rinsed out WE's microspikes that were full of mud. Lee went up and finished the laundry for us while we had dinner of salad with leftover rotisserie chicken and garlic knots. It was delicious. WE told Lee about our schnapps conversation that took place over hot cocoa. We'll see what happens with that. I talked with Brian for a few minutes and was in bed at 7:30 already dosed with NyQuil. We'll be sleeping in until 6am because we have a shorter day planned over Unaka mountain tomorrow. Shorter miles but a 5,000 footer so we'll be climbing and I'm hoping there's none of that Tennessee mud!","Carver's Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605405,"I woke up every 4 hours last night and dosed myself with NyQuil and went back to sleep. We slept in until 6am having a shorter hike today. Lee made us pancakes for breakfast and again I just love the real maple syrup. The weather was clear and it was 39° when we left the campground but it quickly dropped to 31° on the drive to Iron mountain Gap and back up to 38° at the trail head which made me smile. Another gorgeous day with a bit milder start...I'll take it! On the drive up Lee said she was going to find a liquor store. I'm smiling again. 
The trail started off descending out of Iron Mountain Gap but quickly changed direction and climbed up to 4,300'. Although Guthooks claimed a view I didn't see anything that wasn't obscured by trees. I immediately thought the climb must be Unaka mountain already and was disappointed to learn that was still over 5 miles away. 3.1 miles in we stopped at Cherry Gap shelter and enjoyed our hot cocoa and leftover garlic knots at the sunny picnic table. It was remarkable how much graffiti was on the shelter. Really disappointing and I wish it wasn't that way. None of it is necessary. One note about Tennessee shelters is that they don't have a privy. It's like inviting someone to your house for a sleepover and not letting them use your bathroom. I don't know why Tennessee is like that but it doesn't feel right not having a privy. From here it was a 4 mile ascent to the summit of Unaka mountain but at least for the majority of it the trail was gorgeous switchbacking thru rhododendron forest and pines accented with lush green moss which I haven't seen in a long time. The top of Unaka was a mossy pine forest and I thought it was beautiful but WE said it didn't ""feel good"" to her and so we didn't linger. On the descent we found a nice sunny spot with the perfect log for sitting on and enjoyed our lunch there. The temperature must have been 50° and I had already stripped down to one shirt on the climb up Unaka when I also had given myself the gift of music for the climb. We descended and had another ascent up to the appropriately named Beauty Spot which was a wonderful place to be to today. We passed only one person out for a walk from the parking lot there. We encountered no Tennessee mud today thankfully but we did have to endure seeing the guts of a deer discarded on both sides barely off the footpath. It was unfortunate. On the other side of the bald the trail descended 2 miles on wide trail down to Indian Grave Gap where we found a missionary Brother Tom with trail magic. He offered hot and cold beverages, fruit, brownies and other goodies. There were 4 sobo hikers there when we arrived all headed to Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel for the night. They told us about the hiker Thanksgiving feast in Hot Springs NC and they are going to be enjoying that while we're at Shirley's restaurant. I'm glad they will be able to celebrate the holiday with a traditional meal. I said goodbye to Brother Tom and climbed into the car with Lee who was waiting. WE hasn't had much trail magic so I was happy to see her smiling and refreshed by it emotionally and physically. Lee made us salmon cakes and pan fried potatoes with onions for dinner and we indulged after showers. It was really good. WE brought Romeo out to the pavilion near the bathhouse and trimmed his nails for which he put on so such a production that the woman in the office came out to see where the cat was screaming from. Embarrassed by his vocal ability I exited the area so I wouldn't be associated with what sounded like the torturing of a helpless cat. I like the little guy but really?Getting done with our hike early in the day leaves more time for relaxing and journaling. It's nice to have that. I'll turn in early tonight and sleep in until 6am again. Rain is forecast for tomorrow and we'll see what it looks like when we wake up. I've hiked over 1,500 miles now. WOW!","Iron mountain Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605422,"We slept in a bit since we were monitoring the weather and had only a shy 12 miles to hike today. I slept well waking to take another dose of NyQuil a little after midnight. I hope this cold exits my body soon. I packed up the sandwich I made last night and the ""tippy cow"" shot Lee bought me. With my bag ready Lee made us bagels and cream cheese and scrambled eggs. I'm feeling very spoiled but she likes cooking for us, running errands and shuttling us. I gave her some money and a small list of items I'd need soon and she drove us to the trail. The goal was for her to avoid the stores the day before Thanksgiving until after Black Friday. 
Just before the trailhead this morning off a forest service road a barking dog chased the car startling all of us. We then reached a cattle grate and Lee stopped to let us out. The trail was .2 down the road but we weren't sure if she'd be able to turn around down there so we'd walk it. After gathering our packs and trekking poles from the back we said goodbye to Lee and walked in front of the truck to be immediately chased by a pit bull. A back biting one, meaning that when we faced the dog it backed away but as we turned and walked away from it the dog advanced towards us barking and snarling. I would absolutely use my poles to defend myself if needed. But WE is a former dog trainer and quickly assessed this one. I blew my jet scream whistle and the dog turned away and didn't resume his obviously planned attack. A moment later a pickup truck drove past us and dropped 3 hikers off at the trail. We said hello to everyone before we headed north and they headed south. I passed by a nice little falls not far into the hike but the trees obscured the view of it  enough to make it difficult to get a full photo. I did see any other hikers on this section of the trail today. It was about 39° when we started at 8:30 but that was the high for the day. As we climbed up about 1,000' the breeze picked up and the temperature dropped. When we reached Moreland Gap shelter we made hot chocolate and I ate my apple. We had little bottles of ""Tippy Cow"" that Lee bought us to add to the cocoa and it was delicious! I'm still struggling with this cold though and in one of my not so wonderful moments I had to sneeze with my mouth full of apple. At this point we all know I had 2 choices...try to control the sneeze and end up trying to get the apple out of my sinuses for the rest of the day....or turn away and give up the control, which I did. The apple pieces flew from my mouth and to my horror a bunch of snot from my nose! At least I could laugh about it and WE did too. After all I just learned how to do a snot rocket and now I know a new technique. It's not glamorous I know but its real life out here. I was so chilly that I fished my puffy out of my backpack for the first time since I've been back. I wore it the rest of the day unzipped while climbing and zipped when I cooled off on descents. I didn't stop to eat my sandwich but did snack while I walked. Just before I reached the rotting cabin I met a hunter with a dog. The dog had a bell and I stopped and talked to him for a minute and then we walked and talked. It's grouse and woodcock season and his dog wears a bird bell. He was curious about what we eat and if dehydrating my own meals really works so I offered my experience. When he reached a side trail he and his dog headed off and I was less than a half mile to the parking area where Lee was waiting. WE was already in the car so I dropped my pack in the back and selected a root beer from the drinks Lee brought us and enjoyed it with my sandwich on the ride back. WE and I worked on our mileage and schedule at the table and then I went to the bathhouse for my shower. I'm going to miss these showers when we move the camper in a few days. I know we won't have such a nice bathhouse again. I had a salad with chicken and a can of Spaghettios for my dinner and then talked to my sister Catie in GA to let her know my ETA on Springer. I'm looking forward to seeing her and to summiting Springer even though it's not the end of my hike. I talked with Brian and the snow and cold temps are still prevailing in NH. Geez it's so early in the season still but it's already snowed 3 days. Romeo had taken to sleeping with me. He's going to hike a short 6 miles with us on Thanksgiving day. I've never seen a hiking chihuahua so I'm looking forward to it.","Forest service road 293

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605421,"Lee made us pancakes this morning and we filled our empty Tippy Cow bottles with butterscotch schnapps before we left for the trail. I'd made us turkey sandwiches last night and we've started having electrolytes in the car when we get picked up because we realized we're not drinking much water during the hikes so we made sure those were ready for Lee to bring later. 
It was a chilly start as it has been lately with temps in the upper 20's. I put my neck warmer on and pulled it up over my mouth and nose for the first 20 minutes. We hiked up over a hill only to come back down and cross a street that is really close to the trailhead where we were dropped off. It felt ridiculous. On the other side of the street the trail resumed climbing and in seeing the switchbacks before me I stopped after the first couple of them and removed my neck warmer, putting it on my left arm. A while later I removed my fleece. We hiked up into a field with a good area of low growth on each side of it. I noticed a sign on a tree explaining the effort to revitalize the area as a yellow winged warbler habitat because the species is becoming endangered here. I looked around but didn't see any bird activity. The sun however was already working on warming things up. At the top of the climb thru the meadows the view reward was nice. I stood for a few. It's quiet out here today and I'm taking it all in. The frost on the brush, the trees all bare for the winter and the trail as it tunnels thru rhododendron forest up ahead. More pasture climb and more views. About 4 miles in we crossed a road and stopped in the parking lot of a church to have our hot chocolate and snack in the sunshine. Sitting on the cold concrete is when I noticed that I was missing my neck warmer. I must have dropped it when I took off my fleece. I was bummed because I've had that warmer for close to 20 years. It's a simple fleece one but I love it. I pull it up over my mouth and nose and It warms the air nicely when it's really cold so it doesn't hurt when I breathe in. It was 10am and I felt funny drinking my spiked cocoa in a church yard before 10am but it was so yummy! My knees are hurting. These mountains are big 4,000-6,000'+ and it's easy for me to forget about keeping soft knees on descents because the switchbacks are graded. But the descents are miles long and the trauma to the knees is real so today I began the practice of soft knees as I had done up north on much steeper grades and I hope it helps. That and plenty of vitamin I. We took a side trail to Jones Falls. Completely worth every extra step! They are beautiful falls and there was no one around! Just before the side trail however I took a butt slide down a set of log steps that were covered in dry leaves. WE came around the corner to find me sitting there with both legs outstretched and reaching for my stray poles. We both laughed. Yes dry leaves are slippery! A half mile before the side trail to the shelter I came upon WE perched on a log with her sandwich in hand. I was very hungry too so I joined her and shared my chips. We cooled off quickly even though the day had warmed so nicely but I think it was the breeze. We finished the climb after lunch and had one more view reward before reaching the state forest road where Lee was waiting. The rhododendron in this section were so pretty and I can imagine them in spring bloom. I'd love to return to see them and walk through the tunnels of them on trail. We fixed ourselves bagels and cream cheese and I had Spaghettios with it. Lee has caught my cold and is I'm bed early. She bought peppermint schnapps and Rumchata today. The schnapps for our cocoa. But I tried the Rumchata and that is delicious! WE gave Lee a shot or 2 of it and some NyQuil so hopefully she'll get some rest. Tomorrow is Thanksgiving and we're going to hike 6.5 miles and bring Romeo with us. I've not hiked with him before and Chihuahua are not generally dogs you see out hiking. Then it's dinner at Shirley's restaurant and I've been looking forward to it.","Route 19E

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605495,"It's Thanksgiving day today and we were up at our usual 6am but Lee wasn't feeling well so we had breakfast at McDonald's. I met a worker there named Brian who suffered a brain injury. He's open about what happened and his thankfulness to God. It was nice talking to him. It made me think about what I sometimes take for granted, as he said he did. It can change in an instant. 
I wanted to mention that yesterday near Mountaineer shelter I ran into a crew of 4 trail maintainers working hard to keep the trail in good condition. They were having fun and I thanked them and we joked for a minute about me being late in the season and needing to do an hour of trail work to pass. I'm always so appreciative when I see these volunteers because I know they work so hard. Lee dropped us off at Low Gap and we took Romeo with us. The weather was nice with sunny blue skies in the upper 30's and our hike to TN 91 was about 6.5 miles. Romeo ran ahead and back many times just filled with excitement. He flushed 3 grouse and I thought if we were hunters we'd be headed home with our loot! We stopped about half way at Double Spring shelter for a snack and bundled Romeo up to keep him warm while he feasted on jerky at the picnic table. When we resumed our hike Romeo stayed closer being a bit tired but he perked up when we came across 2 day hikers sitting on stumps and snacking on some sausage and cheese...he was all about that! We greeted them and wished them a happy Thanksgiving and continued on leaving Romeo drooling. For the next couple of miles the hike was nothing special but pleasant. When I popped out of the woods into a beautiful pasture I was filled with emotion. It was really beautiful and I was thinking about some of my family that I hadn't seen in over 35 years until just recently. I stopped in that pasture and made a short video of my gratitude and love for them. It was a beautiful moment for me. I walked through the rest of the pasture and the next one which opened to an incredible view. I sat a moment on the bench there just looking at God's creation. I'm so blessed to be out here. When I reached the barn WE was waiting and we took pictures there. This half mile section thru Osborne's Farm is very special. It was an original section of the trail ( thru private land) but in 1970 it was purchased by the Osborne's and the trail rerouted. In 2001 the Osborne's listed the 250 acres with home and cranberry bog for sale and the ATC purchased it. I don't know what they did with the home but the trail is amazing. It actually includes a half mile of wheelchair accessible Appalachian trail. Even the cattle gates are accessible. It's beautiful knowing that less able bodied people can enjoy this farm. It filled my heart with more gratitude. At the edge of the farm Lee was waiting for us in a parking area and we hopped in. Back at the campground we dropped Lee off and WE and I grabbed lunch at McDonald's in town before heading back to shower and get ready for our reservation at Shirley's restaurant. I snuck in a load of hiking laundry too. We arrived at Shirley's a few minutes early but didn't wait long to be seated. The meal was family style and biscuits were brought out first with real butter. Yum! Then the plates and bowls filled with turkey and stuffing and all the sides came out. Most was good and some was just different, like I've never had cornbread salad before. We were stuffed to the gills when we left there! After a stop at CVS we went back to the camper to digest. I crawled into bed early knowing we have 16 miles to hike tomorrow and I suggested we do it northbound so we climb more than descend because my knees need a break.","Low Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605496,"My cold is getting better and I can sleep and breathe through the night without NyQuil. During the day I'm constantly blowing my nose but it's a combination of the cold weather and my cold. This morning Lee cooked us eggs and toast after getting up just after 6am. I made a sandwich for lunch and filled up my water and brought a Body Armor hydration drink to the car for later. 
Lee dropped us off at Wilbur Dam Rd and the drive out there was pretty. Today's hike will be northbound and we'll end across from Osborne's Farm connecting to yesterday's hike. Romeo was being very vocal looking for words to express how much he wanted to hike today but he's a dog and the words came out a whiny jumble. He was distracted by treats while we slipped away and up the hill. We climbed up into the wind steadily for about 2 miles before reaching a ridge that overlooked the Watauga lake. The wind was sustained and cold featuring eye watering gusts. I pulled my buff up over my mouth, nose and face to protect it. Along the ridge we climbed up and down with the lake to our right below but never clearly visible. Between the haze, the angle of the sun and the trees it was almost impossible to get a photo worthy of the beauty I know is there. We came upon Vandevinteer shelter and stopped for hot cocoa and a snack. The view from behind the shelter was very pretty but again the sun and haze obscured it. The shelter is perched on top of the ridge and right on trail and with it's back to the wind. It was an excellent place for a few minutes protection. We drank our cocoa and schnapps and I ate my banana and a protein bar. I had peppermint schnapps today and I'll say I prefer the butterscotch. WE spilled the last of the hot water when she went to grab the pot off my stove and my skirt got wet in the process but my leggings were spared. We stepped back out into the wind continuing up and down along the ridge. There was an incredible amount of tree damage with limbs and branches scattered about the trail. For miles we climbed over piles of brush littering the trail. WE caught her foot on a limb and did a belly flop on the trail coming down hard on her knees. It became tiring wading through, over and around the brush. Along the sides of the trail many multi-flora rose vines with their sharp thorns. They twist around each other and up and around other flora along the trail making it hard to go off trail for a potty break and also hard to get around some of this brush. WE was just in front of me and had barely made it out of site when I found myself frozen in place unable to move. A rose vine had reached out in the wind and combed it's thorny fingers into the hair on the back of my head under my ponytail. I thought for a minute and turned slightly left so I could see it grabbing it with my mittened hand and pulling it. It pulled a chunk of my hair from my ponytail and let go. I stepped forward away from it and fixed my hair putting what was pulled loose back up and putting my buff up around my ears and head like a headband to keep my cold ears warm since my hat was off because it was making me sweat. I caught back up with WE just in time for us to both become assaulted by falling chunks of frozen snow. Like mini snowballs. We couldn't see it was coming from, it certainly wasn't snowing this stuff. And WE noticed the very tips of the trees were coated in it and the sun wind combination was causing it to fall upon us. More and more brush down. So much damage and all of it very recent. We crossed paths with a section hiker and then arrived at Iron Mountain shelter which wasn't as protected from the wind. I ate my lunch and got a call from Kyle with a work question. We talked for a few minutes during which I had to start hiking to keep from getting too cold. It was 36° now and the sun was out but the biting wind would not cease. We ran into southbound thru hikers Jalapeno and her partner who's name I didn't catch. They were going to try for 10 miles to Vandevinteer shelter for the night but that meant they'd have to navigate the trail and brush in the dark. We arrived at TN 91 across from the Osborne's Farm just before 4pm and ahead of schedule. Lee went right to bed when we got to the camper, still feeling miserable. WE and I showered and made burgers and baked beans for dinner and had Tate's chocolate chip cookies for dessert. We'll be off tomorrow. Rain overnight and more wind and chances of rain until 11am. Taking the direction we did today was helpful to my knee. I soft kneed down all the descent I could and I'm feeling less pain. A day of rest is in order and Sunday is our last hike up here. We'll be moving towards Fontana on Monday and hiking straight to Springer Mt from there. Exciting! Brian bought me a new neck warmer and it's being shipped to Bryson City along with some other gear I asked him to send me. I look forward to having my wind jacket, water bladder and other goodies!","Wilbur Dam Rd

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605497,"We took today as a day of rest and slept in a little. A very little. Lee showered and went to the laundromat early and I made breakfast for myself and WE and did some housekeeping. Then WE and I started a video of what it's like to live in a 17' camper with 3 adults and 2 dogs. It's humorous and we posted it on Facebook and YouTube. 
The rest of the day was nothing notable. It's different from being on trail and sleeping in shelters or my tent and a hostel or hotel every few days. When I was living like that I'd have lots of chores on a day off and I would be very busy. But coming back to the camper every day means I get a shower, food and laundry done during the week making a day off filled with ""nothing"". WE did need a new day pack so we took a ride to Johnson City and Dick's. Much to our disappointment they had only 3. Nothing that would be of consideration. So we located Mahoney's an outfitter just a mile away and shopped there instead. I had all I could do not to buy anything for myself. It's really dangerous for a hiker to go into a gear shop. Its so hard to stop myself when I always see things I need or want. Really, I could use a down skirt and down hoodie and don't I need that really pretty Buff? I shoved my hands in my pockets and did a nervous dance by the front door waiting for WE to cash out with her new cool day pack. Ugh, that was so hard walking away with nothing! But WAIT! Could it be? Outside was a ranger with a cool display and educational material and he had a Roan Mountain State Park patch...which he gave me for free, so I walked away feeling better.  We'd planned to go to Lonestar Steakhouse for dinner and I'd been drooling about it all week. But as we arrived at the darkened building there was a note on the door that they were closed. I think permanently. So we scrambled to find another steakhouse in Elizabethton and stumbled into Fatz Cafe. Dinner was good and I had my first beer in months along with a steak, baked potato and broccoli. It was delicious and I texted River who knew exactly what I'd order. She's down below Fontana right now and I'm hoping to see her soon. Tomorrow is our last hike in Tennessee and then we go to Fontana on Monday to hike to Springer. I'll have less than 200 miles left to hike with WE. I'm not sure if I'll be able to fill in some of the miles in the Smokies or VA that I'm missing but we'll see. Romeo will be hiking the 13 miles with us tomorrow so I hope he rests well!","

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605498,"I'm glad we didn't hike yesterday in the wind and rain. Today was a beautiful day! WE had trouble getting motivated but once she was up she made us soft boiled eggs and toast for breakfast. She scooped the eggs out into bowls for each of us and then cut hers all up.....and added a healthy handful of Nestle chocolate morsels. Yes, she did that and I still shudder to think about it. She said her grandmother taught her that when she was young to get her to eat eggs and she just continued into adulthood.Lee drove us to the trail as usual. The temp was 42° and a great blue heron was walking across the road to the river as we headed to Wilbur Dam Rd to be dropped off. My favorite bird! It was a pretty drive. 
We hiked over a smallish climb, none of them feel really small, and eventually across Wilbur Dam. The lake looked pretty this morning and the sunlight seemed just right. I studied the spillway for a few minutes noting the roads within and how it would be fun to explore. We headed away from the dam and around the lake on a smooth trail with almost constant views of the lake. A small boat with fisherman was the only activity I noticed from a beautiful lakeside campsite before the trail turned and headed up. About 4.5 miles into the hike we took a .10 mile detour to Boots Off Hostel and got lucky enough to be picked up by a worker who rode us up the driveway in the bed of his pickup truck. Romeo had his first pickup bed ride since he was hiking with us today. We took a 20-30 minute break and bought soda since it was really too warm for hot cocoa and ate inside in a heated area. The hostel is very clean and nice, even the outdoor restroom. We got our passports stamped, signed the journal and decided we'd better get this 2.5 mile and 2,000' elevation climbing done while we are fueled up. We walked down the driveway we were very grateful to have ridden up and headed immediately up the mountain. I personally didn't find it all that bad because the day was just too beautiful for the hike. I even sweat a bit! We found a spot by a spring just after the summit and took a seat on a perfect log for dining. Romeo's appetite was insatiable and I've never seen a little dog eat so much. He devoured his meal of freeze dried dog food, a half sandwich and 2 rolls left over from the night before and he would have eaten more. While we were working on finishing our lunch Romeo whined and stomped because he wanted to keep hiking. He's a hiking junkie! We headed back out and down to Laurel Fork Falls and ran into 15-20 day hikers in total enjoying the falls. We took our photos from above them and opted not to hike all the way down because to our left was an elevation gain of about 500' accompanied by 300 stone steps. Oh goodie! We left ahead of and stayed ahead of the day hikers meeting several more and some with dogs and of course Romeo showed off his big dog macho attitude but made it through unscathed to the trailhead where Lee was waiting. I had a craving for ice cream on the hike out and Lee graciously agreed to drive us into town to Dairy Queen so we could satiate the craving. I indulged in a brownie sundae. Back at the camper we had chicken, potatoes and veggies for dinner and I watched TV on my phone until 9pm. Tomorrow is a day off and we're relocating to Bryson City NC where we'll be hiking from Fontana dam to Springer Mt.","Wilbur Dam Rd

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605586,"We got to sleep in a little, a very little because the dogs always need to go out to the bathroom first thing in the morning. Lee got up and did dog duty and then made us breakfast. We packed up the camper and around 10 we rolled out of Elizabethton TN and headed toward Fontana Dam and the town of Bryson City North Carolina. The drive was about 3 hours and we stopped for gas and a quick snack on the way. When we arrived in Bryson City at the campground there was no one around and the bath house was locked, but we pulled into the site that was assigned to us and set up camp. With the nights being so cold we can't leave the water line connected to the camper all night so when it's below freezing the freshwater tank gets filled and then we brings the hose in for the night and we run off the stored water with the pump. but actually all works very well it's just inconvenient to have to take the water hose off. WE finally spoke with the campground manager and they explained that the bath houses are winterized and locked for the season and that there is no Wi-Fi. At least our cell phones get a decent signal here. The campground is unique in that all the sites pull directly off the main road there's no campground road and across the street is somewhat of a gravel pit except it's more of a rock pit with large equipment kind of dangling off the side of this big hill and I can imagine how loud it is when they're up there with that ginormous jackhammer! At least I sleep in the back of the camper where a little creek flows by and I'm hiking all day. The weather doesn't look all that wonderful in the near future we're going to experience some below record cold some snow some ice and of course rain.

I'm very excited because I've been sleeping well and so for the last 3 nights I have not had to take melatonin, this is a good sign for me. I'm feeling pretty energetic and my hiker hunger has once again found its way to my belly. I can't seem to eat enough at dinner and I'm snacking after just to fulfill my needs. 
It was a balmy 24 degrees when Lee dropped us off at Stecoah Gap. I'm really missing my neck warmer but my buff is making do. as we increased in elevation the trees became encased in rime ice. It was once again beautiful. the rhododendron leaves were frozen and hanging curled up and limp reminding me of the way hand-dipped candles look when they're hanging to dry.  We stopped for lunch at cable Gap shelter where we were surprised to meet another southbound hiker named Wildlife, she's from Boston. She's hiking solo and was slackpacking as well and also let us know that up ahead of us we would run into two section hikers. Today we're hiking North and Wildlife is hiking South so we left in opposite directions after an extremely brief lunch due to the cold. once again my water bottles were freezing and I had to break through ice at the top of the bottle in order to pour water out to make hot chocolate. I also had to for the first time put my wool leggings on over my tights, and I wore two layers on my hands from the shelter thru the rest of the hike. A pair of gloves with a pair of mittens over them just to keep my fingers warm. I wasn't quite warm enough and I thought when I finished the hike I'll stop at the outfitter at the Nantahala Outdoors Center (NOC) and grab a warmer pair of mittens or perhaps rain mitts. Moisture from my exhaled breath is forming on my eyelashes and freezing! I'm pretty sure these temperatures are stunningly low for this area for this time of year and tomorrow will be colder. I know that my package with my neck warmer is being delivered to the post office today but unfortunately there's no way that I would be able to make it there before they close so tomorrow I'll have to plan accordingly so I can finish hiking in time to get there before they close at 4:30. My buff is thin and I'm using it as a neck warmer so I double it up but the material kind of gets caught in my mouth sometimes when I'm breathing and it doesn't stay put. Toward the end of the hike we did see the two section hikers and then we came down into a parking lot at a trailhead where the bathrooms were still open ( seems they're open all year unlike NH). I saw a hiker standing outside and I waived but  we didn't stop instead we just continued on to the Fontana Hilton which is a shelter that has heated bathrooms with showers, a phone charging station, trash bins, and a beautiful view. it's actually the Fontana Dam shelter but it's nicknamed Fontana Hilton because it has all of these amenities. I was freezing and I stopped in there to get out of the wind use the restroom and soak up the heat for a few minutes before proceeding down the paved drive wildly exposed to the biting wind and to the parking area by the visitor center where Lee was waiting. I was extremely grateful for the heat in the car and a pup on my lap! We stopped at the NOC at 4:35 to discover that they close at 4. So strike 2 on getting warmer tomorrow, I'm just going to have to suck it up buttercup! we went back to the camper and had dinner and retired for the evening toasty warm under my blanket with Romeo.","Stecoah Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605592,"After a hearty breakfast Lee drove us up to Stecoah Gap again and dropped us off at 7:30 with a temperature of 15 degrees. We hiked south today and there's a good chance we'll see Wildlife again if she hikes in this misery.  Aside from snowshoeing in New Hampshire occasionally in these temps this is the longest coldest hike I've had out here.  As Lee left us on the side of the trail all I could think about was how nice it would be to sit in my basement with Brian huddled around the wood stove with a glass of wine. I was thinking how crazy I am to be doing this and wondering why is it I can't just stop. the thinking only lasts a minute before reality kicks in and I realize I must move and move quickly all day in order to stay warm enough. and today I started with my wool leggings on over my tights because I knew I would need them. We had to climb right away and I'll admit it was extremely hard for me. it was cold and I just felt like I was gasping for air and I wondered if I would make it I could just kept thinking about turning around and getting out of there. Wildlife hiked up behind me and I let her pass but kept up with her until we reached the summit. We all enjoyed the view at the top of a small bald that was really mostly wooded. If Wildlife hadn't pointed it out we would have walked right by not realizing we were at the peak. The trail was covered in about an inch of snow. Trekking was quiet and beautiful. We stopped at two shelters one for hot chocolate and a snack very quickly and the second one for lunch again very quickly.
I was extremely happy to be descending toward the NOC. WE must have been happy also because she took off like a bullet and I couldn't catch her until I reached the bridge at NOC. I walked across and took a few pictures of the river and noted the sign for the Trail of tears but I didn't know what that was. Later WE told me that it was terrible tragedy we're Americans marched Indians and many of them died. I'm going to be reading up on that piece of tragic history. Lee was waiting for us outside the NOC and told WE that her sister Ruth had called and that their mom was in the hospital. while she was on the telephone getting the hospital information I found a fuel canister and an ornament but ironically no warmer mittens than what I had. I think my suspicion is true that this weather is pretty harsh for the area. I hope it passes through soon and ushers in some warmth. I got my passport stamped beforewe left the NOC. We were headed towards the post office so that I could pick up my neck warmer when WE received the tragic news that her mom had actually passed away. She passed away on a flight to see her new great grandchild and she was bringing a cat for her granddaughter. A passenger on the plane thoughtfully tucked a note inside the carrier telling that the cat was named Daisy and who it was intended for. Marjorie was 86 and was very vibrant and led a very independent life. WE was in shock. Somberly we stopped at the post office for my neck warmer, did laundry at the laundromat and ate at Bojangles before heading back to the camper. WE decided that we'd hike 17 miles tomorrow and on Friday they'll drop me in Franklin NC and head home. She will finish her hike next year. I'm very sad for her for the loss of her Mom who she was close to. When I heard them on the phone Thanksgiving day I could tell it was a mother daughter relationship filled with love.","Stecoah Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605605,"It was a somber day today. I know that WE had posted on Facebook that she was dedicating today's hike to her mom. It brought tears to my eyes but at the same time I felt honored to accompany her. After Lee made us pancakes she drove us up the long mountain road to the top of Wayah Bald and we saw the most spectacular sunrise I think I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. It was certainly moving and very fitting for today's hike. What a way to start the day! The temperature at the top of the bald was 30 degrees when we got out of the car. There are restrooms in the parking area and thus we took advantage of those before setting off northbound toward a stone monument in memory of John Bernard Byrne. The panoramic mountain views from the bald and even more so from the monument made me want to stay here much longer just looking at God's creation. We took photos of each other and growing cold realized that we needed to get moving. 
I hiked most of the day in front of WE at a comfortable 2 mile per hour pace. WE shared stories about her Mom when I asked questions about her and they were happy, fun memories for WE. The trail was really nice and we stopped at a shelter for hot chocolate and a snack. When we reached Telleco Gap we sat on a wooden retaining wall by the side of the street and I ate my sandwich as quickly as I could so that we wouldn't become chilled and also because it had started raining. While I was eating Wildlife appeared hiking southbound and she was only carrying one trekking Pole. She shared with us that yesterday after we saw her she took a spill injuring her ankle and breaking one of her poles. She ended up staying at NOC instead of hiking the additional 4 miles to a shelter but her foot was feeling better and her hiking pole parts were being shipped to Hiawassee. WE shared the news of her Mom's passing. We hiked out in our own direction, again with me in front and WE trailing behind. I stopped a few times to give her a chance to catch up a bit, wanting to make sure that she was okay and that I didn't get too far in front of her. It was raining heavier now, of course. Cold rain and I had  my full rain gear on now. I saw a woman approaching southbound on the trail with a white dog that looked like a boxer. We stopped and chatted and I noticed that she had a name tag on that read Dr Mary and it had a cross on it. We were still talking when WE arrived and noting the name tag asked Dr Mary if she was a trail chaplain. Indeed she was and she was headed to the next shelter for the night with her dog Daisy. I asked WE if I could share with Dr Mary and she consented and I shared that WE had lost her mother yesterday. We prayed together right there on trail and it was an emotional moment for us all. The rest of the story is that of the cat WE's Mom was carrying yesterday on the plane, sharing the same name as Dr Mary's dog Daisy. I believe this was not a chance meeting or coincidence. I think WE cried the remaining 3+ miles to the car. The hike today was cathartic. It's also our last hike together until WE does NH next summer and hopefully I'll get to hike a section with her. Tomorrow I'll hike the other side of Wayah Bald headed south if the weather permits and if not then they will drop me off in Franklin NC. Down at the NOC I greeted Lee and we waited for WE to arrive, loaded into the car and headed back to the camper. I got extra dog cuddling with both Romeo and Speck. I'll miss them both. After dinner we retired and watched TV on our phones. I watched an episode of the First 48 before dozing off with a warm pup next to me.","Wayah Bald

Hugged and cried with WE when she dropped me off. Kissed the pups goodbye. My sister Catie is excited I'm almost to Springer Mt where she'll meet me. I'm looking forward to seeing her. Talked into hiking in the rain tomorrow. Hotel has laundry so that helps. I can dry my boots on the heater. 
When I woke up at 4 it was pouring rain and I could hear it on the camper roof. It rained off and on for the next couple of hours. At 6 my alarm went off and I checked the weather. It was socked in up at Wayah shelter. I couldn't see WE driving me up that mountain road socked in with fog. Too stressful. We all went back to bed for a bit and then had breakfast and packed up the camper. I packed up my backpack. Around 9:30 we headed out camper in tow for Franklin. River, Galaxy and Songbird were there staying with River's friend Christine. I could stay there but I might have to sleep on my sleeping pad and honestly I'm feeling like I want my own space right now so I called the Budget Inn after learning the Hostel in  town is closed and WE and Lee dropped me off there before 11am. WE and I grabbed my bags from the camper and I checked in. We cried and hugged goodbye then I hugged Lee and each one of the pups. I'll miss everyone. In my room I settled in and thought about what my plans might be but I really needed to see what River, Songbird and Galaxy were doing and they were out hiking a short day in the rain. At lunch time I looked outside thinking I might go for a walk and get lunch but it was pouring again so I ordered delivery from Gazebo Cafe which took almost an hour to arrive. I ate the corn chowder and half the roast beef sandwich along with chips and pickle and stored the rest in the fridge. I watched TV and posted on Instagram. Just a few minutes after my post I received a request for messaging on Instagram. It was Wildlife. I knew she was planning to be in town and was planning to stay at the hostel too. As it turns out she was right next door to me! River texted and the gang was all coming to town to the coffee shop for WiFi and so she picked us up and we all enjoyed a couple of hours together. Christine brought Wildlife to Ingles grocery store and River dropped me off at the motel. We decided to hike in the rain tomorrow so River will drive everyone to Deep Gap where Wildlife and I will hike 21 miles north to Rock Gap and everyone else will hike south. This means that Sunday I'll fill in the section from Wayah Bald to Rock Gap and Christine has agreed to drop me at Wayah Bald Sunday morning. So I'll need to get rest! I watched TV for a while and fell asleep.","

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605640,"Its Hard to believe it's December and I'm still out here. I turned on the TV and while getting ready and learned that George H W  Bush passed away. River picked us up at 7am and dropped us at Deep Gap so we could hike 21.7 North back into town while she, Galaxy and Songbird hike south from the same spot. She brought a pair of trekking poles from Christine for me to borrow because at 9:30 last night I realized I'd left mine in the back of WE's car and they were on their way to PA where they wouldn't be helpful to me. I Had oatmeal and a breakfast shake for breakfast in my room. It been a while since I have had that for breakfast but it fueled me well. It was raining lightly when we set off with Wildlife in the lead at 8 am. We immediately climbed up Indian Mt and I managed to keep up with Wildlife which I was concerned about. I didn't want my middle age to show while hiking with a 25 year old!  After the summit we hiked down for a while and then on a nice flat section of trail where we were in a nice cruising speed. It was raining steady and cold and I tripped on a root and took a swan dive (because it sounds better than belly flop!) into the muddy water on the trail soaking the left side of my leggings and bruising my forearm. We Stopped at 11am for lunch and I ate the other half of my sandwich from yesterday at the shelter. We continued on and after debating on the bad weather trail near the top of Albert mountain decided to go for the gold and went straight up the rocky summit in wind and rain. We didn't linger on the summit but 2.5 miles after at a shelter we stopped to  snack and add another layer and some dry mittens. Wildlifes hands were so cold her fine motor skills were effected and I noticed she was dropping her peanut M&Ms she was snacking on and couldn't seal the bag. She hadn't been wearing gloves all day but instead was using one trekking pole and tucking her free hand inside her coat sleeve to try to keep them warm by alternating. She was cold and shaking and I knew we'd be on a flatter section without the same energy expended to keep warm so I encouraged her to add a layer and I added a wool base layer over my existing shirts. She put mittens on with my help but was saving her fleece. I took the lead hiking as fast as I could so we could be as warm as possible. We  Made it the last 3.7 ahead of schedule and thankfully shuttle driver arrived early with a warm dry car. We hiked that 21+ miles in 7.5 hours, a record speed for me! 
Wildlife and I showered and went to the Outdoor 76 store for new poles for me and a beer. We signed the thru hiker banner and enjoyed our beer which was on the house along with some Outdoor 76 class of 2018 bandanas which was very nice. They didn't have any cork handled poles so I settled for rubber grips. When we finished there we went back and threw in a load of laundry together. I love this little town with its vibrant Main St and Christmas decorations. River, Songbird and Galaxy stopped by the hotel to say goodbye to me after they showered and ate because I was too tired to go back out for a beer. I'd ordered pizza for dinner and walked to convenience store for a pint of ice cream which I was eating when they arrived. Songbird was impressed that I put half back in freezer but I think I had it back out before their tail lights faded away and finished it off. There were Hugs, tears and Galaxy and Songbird shared a song friends wrote for them called Appalachian Blue and Green and it was really wonderful and touching. I'm sad that I wont be summiting Springer Mt with them all but I'm 2 days behind them. I'll be on my own at the summit which is now looking like the 7th.","Deep Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605641,"I ate a pastry from the convenience store for breakfast and was ready to go when Christine arrived at 7am. She drove up the foggy mountain road and dropped me off before taking Wildlife to Deep Gap. I gave her a donation for gas and took pictures with her and Wildlife. It was drizzling so I put on my rain gear and set out. No lingering on the bald today because there was nothing that could be seen thru the fog and clouds. 
For most of the morning it was foggy and damp but before noon the sun burned thru and I was able to peel away my outer layers. It felt great to hike in just my double layer of shirts and feel the warmth of the sun. I saw plenty of my rhododendron tunnels today and passed thru Snowbird Gap and Swinging Lick Gap (the sign has been edited by a hikers pocket knife and I'll just leave that to your imagination). Brian was at brunch with a couple of friends but I couldn't help laughing when I saw the sign and sending him a picture. I'm hiking all alone from here to Springer Mt. I saw only a couple walking puppies toward the end of my hike today, no one else. I've been arranging my shuttles and nightly accommodations a day in advance. Mike the shuttle driver picked me up at Rock Gap and dropped me off at the hotel. I showered and had lunch at the Diner on Main St and it was excellent. I took a brownie to go and walked to Ingles grocery to see about a fresh muffin for breakfast. I was disappointed to learn there was no bakery or deli there so I walked back to the hotel. Later I ventured to the bank nearby to use the ATM and I discovered a breakfast restaurant Country Kitchen. They open at 6am and Mike's picking me up at 7:30 so you bet I'll be there! Now I'm glad that Ingles doesn't have a bakery! And I got to see Santa driving the Habitat for humanity van! It's Sunday and not much is open today so I ordered pasta and chicken wings delivered from Pizza hut. I saved the wings for tomorrow on the trail.","Wayah Bald

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605661,"I woke up at 5:15 so that I could get ready and be at the Country Kitchen just after 6 am for breakfast. It was amazing, eggs with ham, grilled home fries and a mouth watering biscuit with extra butter and jelly. I'm going to miss eating this way! I enjoyed every bite and washed it down with a decaf coffee before heading back to the room to finish packing my bags. Mike arrived at 7:20 and dropped me at Deep Gap before taking my backpack to the budget Inn in Hiawassee. It was a gorgeous day on trail today. The sun was shining and I wore a short sleeve shirt with a thin long sleeve over it. I felt half naked with no gloves, hat, neck warmer or fleece. The leaves were dry and fairly deep causing me to take flight once from a stone step. It always pisses me off because I'm very attentive to my steps. I brushed myself off and remembered that I'm not injured and because thankful for that once again. I saw no one on trail today and I was okay with that. It was such a gorgeous day out here and I had the trail to myself. The spiders were out building their little face traps and I had my fill of their silky weavings but I just brushed them off with my hands. It reminded me of how much more alive the trail is in spring and summer with birds and other critters. Fall can be a solemn time of year out here. Mike picked me up at Dick's Creek gap at 2:30 and stopped at the post office so I could pick up some priority mail boxes before he brought me to the budget Inn in Hiawassee where I was reunited with my pack and checked into room 104. From the exterior the place looked okay with a new metal roof and clean grounds. I stepped into my room and it was vintage complete with red carpet and saggy bed. I can handle vintage for $40 a night but I expect cleanliness and safety. The bathroom faucet had the remnants of another person's stay and the door barely locked. The strike plate was bent and dead bolt arm was busted off. I sat down on the bed to be annoyed by a loose and banging headboard. I won't be spending a second night here.I took everything out of my packs and shipped my tent, quilt and sleeping pad home. I shipped extra clothes and food and other items I'd still need on trail to my sister Catie in Suwanee GA. She'll be picking me up at Springer Mt and we'll get to spend a day together before I head up to VA to meet with River so we can extinguish some of my remaining miles and hopefully complete her thru hike. After packing my boxes I stacked the 3 on top of each other and waddled down the street a half mile to the post office. No one offered me a ride. A kind lady opened the doors for me after the man in front of me apparently didn't hear my pleadings. With that errand complete I turned my attention to a Starbucks sign. Now that is worth some extra steps! I planned to have a decaf a think about dinner but as I got to the building I realized it's inside an Ingles so in I went. A quick survey found the Starbucks right in front of me and a cafe tables over my right shoulder. I strolled for a minute and found a salad bar, soup, hot foods and fresh made to order foods as well as rotisserie chicken and Chinese food. OMG! Too many choices for this hiker hunger! I had to return to the entry for a basket! I picked up watermelon, a bagel with cream cheese, a raspberry Bismarck, a protein shake and orange juice for breakfast. Then I ordered a Chinese food dinner and a banana cream pie pudding and of course a decaf Americana coffee and I ate at the cafe tables before carting my breakfast items back to my room. I plugged in the refrigerator and nothing happened. Damn. I called the manager and he came over and swapped it out for me. Then I took a very hot shower and settled in to journal and talk to Brian. We decided I wouldn't sleep unless I pushed a chair up in front of the door, so I did. Then I called a couple of places in Helen GA to get a room for tomorrow. I'll be at the Super 8. After a few minutes of TV I was sleepy. I hope I can really sleep.","Deep Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605818,"Miraculously I slept and no one tried to enter my room. When I closed the mini blinds last night a piece fell off and one was bent so you could clearly see into my room, but I took some of the packing tape that I purchased at the post office and did a little repair. I had my raspberry filled Bismark my protein shake and my bagel for breakfast along with a cup of decaf that I made in the microwave. Gene picked me up at 7:30 a few minutes early as usual, and I was at the trailhead by 7:50. I had 1.8, 2 and 1.2 miles of climbing with several smaller climbs in between. Sometimes the small 500-700' elevation climbing gets me the most because the grade is steeper. At this point it feels harder mentally and physically. I'm just getting tired of climbing. I was ready for the day to be over as soon as it started.Gene picked me up at Dick's Creek gap at 3:30 and drove me into Helen. It's a Bavarian themed town and all the signs are small and externally lit and we were looking for the Super 8. After 2 trips down Main St and the inability to locate it despite GPS telling us we're there we couldn't find it. We stopped and I grabbed my AWOL guide out of my backpack and called the number that I had used to make the reservation. As soon as I dialed the caller ID on my phone popped up as sure stay by Best Western. Will that answers the question, because my guidebook is from 2017 and the motel was purchased and renamed after the book was printed. So Gene brought me to the Sure Stay and I checked in with a very nice guest relations host named Linda. she's a fan of hikers and felt badly because it took her a while to find my reservation even though she was the woman that I spoke with on the phone yesterday, so she upgraded my room free of charge to a king-size suite with a jacuzzi for which I paid a high crime rate of $55. Absolutely delighted, I went up and took a shower and delightfuly blow dried my hair. I know that sounds like such a simple thing but it's huge because it's cold outside and I need to walk to to dinner and it very cold out. I had a nice steak dinner with a beer at Paul's restaurant which Gene suggested and I took a dessert to go. Back at my room I filled the jacuzzi tub and turned on the Jets and stepped into it with a fresh cup of decaf coffee to enjoy. I soaked for almost half an hour. It was time to enjoy the chocolate cake now and it was decadent! Feeling like I'd sleep well I set my alarm for 5:15 so I could have breakfast in the lobby and be ready for Gene at 6:30. .","Dick's Creek gap
",Unicoi Gap,"Dec 04, Tue",16.70
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605819,"I was up before the 5:15 alarm went off. I got dressed and hauled my gear downstairs to the lobby at 6 leaving it outside. As I entered the lobby I saw the clerk sleeping in a chair. I quietly me and dirt over to the bagels and put one in the toaster. When it popped up it woke her, I didn't say anything I just went about my business of getting my breakfast. I filled myself on a bagel and to yogurt and took a bagel and cinnamon raisin pastry to go. Gene arrived just before 6:45 and we loaded my car into the back of his car and headed to Dick's Creek gap trailhead where he picked me up yesterday. It was still dark out he maneuver the car so his headlights would shine on the trail so I bundled up and put on my headlamp so I'd be able to see. I crossed the road and headed up into my first climb of the day. I turned around about 30 minutes into the hike and saw the beautiful sunrise that was at my back. 
The trail was rocky in spots today requiring a bit more time to hike those areas but there was also a nice flat section that rolled out for a couple of miles. If it weren't for the relentless bitter wind today would have been a nice day. But I forgot to clear my line for my water bladder and thus it froze and I couldn't drink from it for hours. I tucked it between my fleece and 2 under layers and it did eventually thaw. I had a 16 oz bottle of electrolytes I kept in my skirt pocket to prevent freezing. The wind made it impossible to be without gloves for more than a minute. This in turn made it difficult to eat. I managed to get the pastry in me with my gloves on by holding it in the plastic wrapper but when it came to getting the peanut butter on the bagel I could only manage half. The were 2 shelters today but both were off trail and one was 1.2 miles off trail so it wasn't practical to get out of the wind. The last snack I managed was a partially frozen protein bar which I also held by the wrapping. I was hungry and grumpy AKA Hangry because this wasn't enough fuel to sustain my hike. At the bottom of the last climb and 2.2 miles from the hostel I stood and almost cried. I just wanted to be done and fed and watered and warm. I saw 12 people on trail today. 2 were young guys making a YouTube video and looking ridiculous in shorts and a t-shirt hopping around with one sock on and the other off shouting and flailing arms. I didn't know what to think when I came upon them, to me it looked like they needed help.  9 of the others were nobo section hikers and 1 who said he's at the early part of his  thru hike. I think he'll be surprised if he makes it to NH in a few months! Gene had dropped my backpack off at Mountain Crossing hostel for me along with a sleeping bag I'm borrowing. I sent my gear ahead and this hostel doesn't provide linens so Gene offered a bag. Very kind of him! When I finally arrived at the Mountain Crossing at 4pm I picked my pizza and drinks, got my towel for my shower and proceeded to the bunk room. My pack wasn't there so I went back up to the store and the very helpful girl who checked me in called around and learned it has been put in a tote so the mice wouldn't mess with it. So... I guess I really won't be alone tonight was my thought. I returned to the bunk room and located my pack. I devoured the pizza and washed it down with my hot cider and a grape soda before stepping back outside in the wind and cold to make calls for a shuttle and accommodations for tomorrow. Then I sat on my bunk noticing how cool it was in there. No central heat just 2 little electric radiator heaters plugged in. Gene's sleeping bag is looking toasty! I took a shower skipping the hair washing and climbed into the bag with my shorts and wool base layer top. Toasty indeed. I think I'll sleep well here. The weather is supposed to be less windy tommorow and I'm hiking around 16 miles. So far I haven't seen a mouse but I hung my bags just in case!","Unicoi Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605834,"I really did sleep well getting up just once for the bathroom. I got up to start my day at 6:30, planning to hike out at 8. They say the trail provides and sometimes that's absolutely true. There were 4 packages of plain oatmeal in the tote where my backpack was stored for me. The tote is actually a hiker box. I took 2 of them and made hot water in the microwave with my cup from the hot cider last night and I used a package of real maple syrup I had to sweeten it and I made a decaf coffee to go with it. After that I ate the half bagel left from yesterday with a butter packet I had from Paul's restaurant. Because I could see my breath out there in the kitchen/lounge area I took my loot to the bunk room and ate on the side of my bunk. When I finished I cleaned up, packed up and put my backpack in the tote and Gene's sleeping bag back in its bag and on the bunk he'd left it on. At 8am I made my way across the street and began ascending Blood mountain. It was 2.4 miles later that I'd reached the top and met a young man who had hammocked there last night having his breakfast. We said hello and I moved on past the shelter and began the descent down the other side after lingering to enjoy the beautiful views and send a couple of videos out. 
It was a cold but decent day just 15° at the start but clear and sunny so it warmed into the 20's nicely with no wind. I hiked in my fleece all day and never got to take it off. I enjoyed the views on Big Cedar Ledges before descended to Woody Gap where I stopped at the pit toilet in the parking area. Then I begrudgingly climbed Ramrock Mt and and felt myself slowing down on this last 4.5 miles to Gooch Gap. I had arranged for shuttle driver Donald to pick me up and his girlfriend Mary was there to meet me. She'd picked my backpack up at Mountain Crossing on the way and she brought me to Barefoot Hills Hotel in Dahlonega where I had a reservation in the bunk room. The fee was $50 which left me a bit irritated as I felt it was excessive however I hadn't asked how much it would be when I arranged it yesterday. I checked in with Chris and the bunk room was the nicest I'd stayed in....by far. The entire property was gorgeous and I'd highly recommend it. Once I was settled I went to the main building and watched TV in the lobby and ordered a burger. It was around 3pm and I devoured it along with a beer and Coke before showering. Fully satisfied I relaxed on my bunk until almost 6pm when I went back to the lobby and ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup to enjoy there and a 10"" pizza to go. I met Wildlife's Mom in the lobby and we talked for a few minutes before she left to head into town for dinner. I also called some shuttle drivers and arranged my ride back to the trail at 8am tomorrow for $30. I made it back to the bunk room where I sat on the edge of the bed and ate half the pizza. Let me explain, I need more calories when it's cold and I'm already running on a deficit. I wrapped up the other half of the pizza to pack out with me tomorrow so I'd have enough fuel. At 8pm I made my way back to the lobby and used the bathroom to brush my teeth and get ready for bed. There's no bathroom in the bunkhouse but that's not unusual for bunkrooms and hostels, they're often located outside or in another building. I settled into my comfortable bunk and admired the Christmas lights and decor outside on the porch thru the glass doors before closing my eyes. Breakfast is at 8am but I'll be at the lobby at 7:30 as Lauren offered because that's what time she gets in, so I can grab something before Splitter arrives at 8am to drive me back to the trail.","Mountain Crossing hostel

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605839,"It's a big day today. 17.1 miles from Gooch Gap to Springer Mt summit and the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. I'm trying not to be emotional about it because it's not the end of my hike , but I can't help it it's emotional. I turned my alarm off and got up and dressed then packed my backpack which I carried today. I went over to the lobby and said good morning to Wildlife's Mom who was headed out to meet her at the summit. It was raining lightly and I hoped it was just a passing shower. Lauren wasn't there at 7:30 but arrived shortly after and I had some cereal and yogurt before Splitter arrived to bring me back to the trailhead. I put my pack and poles behind the front seat of Splitter's pick up truck and hopped into the passenger seat. Along the 25 minute ride we chatted about the trail which he thru hiked in 2016 at age 54. He seamed surprised to hear that I'd be summiting today and I thought about that for a couple of hours early in my hike. I had no real big challenges today the trail skirts Justus, Sassafras and Hawk mountains and while there were ups and downs there was also plenty of smooth and wide trail with gentle grade. Once I reached the parking area at 3 Forks the trail meandered thru rhododendron forest and along a river and I walked gently up grade for the next 4 miles to the summit. I was tired and emotional a couple of miles before reaching the top. Exchanging a couple of text messages with Brian we both cried. I'm going to summit alone which is not how we planned it but it's just how it has worked out. River, Galaxy and Songbird summited on Wednesday and WE left for her mother's funeral. Brian would have been here if this was the end of my hike but he's my biggest fan, home cheering me on. Someone asked me a few days ago what my husband thinks of me and I answered without pause or question. "" He thinks I'm amazing"". He does and he lets me know. I reached the summit alone, no one was around the markers but there were 2 men who'd set up camp under the no camping sign. I cried when I looked at the plaque and took a few minutes for myself before taking pictures and texting Brian. I wrote in the trail journal ""quiet your mind, soak it all in, it's a game you can win, enjoy the climbs"". My favorite song on trail has been ""enjoy the ride"" by Zach Brown Band and this is how I sometimes sing/change the lyrics in my head. Then I sat down and took out my stove and made a hot cocoa, adding a shot of butterscotch schnapps which I'd saved for this occasion. I made a video for WE toasting to her with my drink and sent it off. I texted with my sister Caitie who was on her way to the parking lot a mile back to pick me up. I packed up and hiked back the mile and waited for her in the parking lot. Just as I settled down to wait 4 men on a day hike came up the trail nobo and we talked for about 15 minutes. They had lots of questions about my hike, commented on the horrifically hungry and brazen mice in the shelter near the summit and I gave them my fuel canister because I can't take it on a plane with me. At 5:30 Caitie arrived just as they were loading up their packs and getting into their trucks to leave. I hugged Catie tight and said goodbye to the men as we drove away. It seemed like a long 2 hours back to Catie's house, mostly because of the bumpy, narrow and winding dirt forest service road. When we arrived at her home the pot roast in the crock pot smelled so comforting and delicious. We ate and I showered and before long I was nestled into the queen size inflatable mattress that was ready for me with sheets, blanket and perfect pillow. No doubt I'll sleep well here.  I'm so happy to be able spend some time with my sister and I'm looking forward to talking her to breakfast tomorrow! Then I have to look at the weather seriously and either get myself to VA or home if there's too much snow in the mountains.","Gooch Gap

She's 38 and she moved to GA 2 years ago and I'm so proud of the woman she's become. She's the GM of a hotel and she's transformed herself in so many ways since moving to GA. She's amazing and I'm so thankful for the time we shared going out to breakfast, grocery shopping, cooking and watching a marathon of Hallmark movies before watching the Patriots lose a game in the final few seconds on Sunday. 
After watching weather cameras and weather reports and seeing my cousin Eileen's Facebook posts I spoke with River and I made the only logical decision I could.  To go home tomorrow and finish my 400 miles in March and April. I'll still be a thru hiker if I finish by April 30 which is my goal. My body is tired and it would be foolish to try to get another 100-200 miles hiked in snow and ice with tons of storm damage this year, if I could even get myself thru the storm and into VA. So I purchased a ticket to fly to Boston and a bus ticket from Logan to NH. I'll be in my husband's arms and our bed tomorrow night. I'm excited to go home and looking forward to Christmas with my family. And I know I will be back on trail as soon as it's safe and practical. I will finish this journey. The trail has really taught me new coping skills. It's a necessity because things happen and on trail there's nothing I can do about it. I have had to learn to think differently, to listen and talk to myself differently. I'm grateful for all the trail had given me and it will help me to finish in the spring. I'm already excited about seeing by rhododendron!!","

It's wonderful to be with my husband, family and friends and to see the joy of Christmas around me. I love to cook and entertain so there's enjoyment there also. But....I miss the trail. I wanted to hike today but life was in the way and that doesn't happen on trail. Two social commitments today left me short on time for what I felt would be a fulfilling hike. But I know those days will come if I'm patient. I've walked the mall to keep exercised and I'm stretching and nursing a tender right knee. Maybe I'm not meant to be hiking at this moment. I ran into my yoga instructor Rebecca out shopping and I'm looking forward to returning to class after Christmas. I find myself researching and looking at web cams in VA and TN when I'm bored so I can see winter's impact in the mountains. I'm planning to return to the trail in early March giving me a large non stressful window to complete my remaining miles by April 30th. And when I'm finished Brian and I will celebrate with a vacation in our new fifth wheel! Now....is it March yet?

When I first got home on December 10th I busied myself with getting ready for the holidays and being with family. I walked the mall several times a week to stay fit. But after the holidays the dark grey of January and February took over and I spent my time in the kitchen instead of the mall baking and eating cupcakes. Needless to say I am bringing some of them back to the trail with me in the form of body fat. I'm not concerned, since I'd lost a total of 54 pounds in the 1700+ miles I've hiked. I'm sure I'll burn through this. 
I've missed the trail. The freedom from distraction it offers, the connection with self and nature. I'm looking forward to finishing the stroll for my soul. I know myself more now than ever and I have an acceptance and comfort with myself like never before. I love myself, finally. I wonder now what else I'll discover in these next few weeks. I have less fear of the unknown, less anxiety and I have a realistic expectation of what it is to hike the Appalachian Trail. I'm in the bus to Logan airport as I write this. Having just hugged and kissed my loving husband and son at the station before boarding. They're so proud of me and it fills my heart with love and confidence. It was a short night of sleep for me last night and at 2 am I was awake. That's common for me. I felt Brian awake next to me when suddenly the realization that I didn't pack my sleeping pad struck me. He got right up and went into the gear room to grab it, not wanting me to fall back asleep and forgot in the morning. But sleep didn't come regardless of how badly I wanted it and despite that fact I still jolted when the alarm sounded at 4:22. After stuffing my sleeping pad into my day bag and grabbing a coffee for the ride to the bus station I wandered into the dark garage and walked around to the driver's side when at the back of the vehicle I was struck in the leg and left crouching and cussing. The dog step which is connected to the hitch was down and I walked right into it. As the pain eased I saw the humor in it. It's simply a reminder of what it feels like to fall on trail. Nothing like being prepared! Today should be smooth and I'm comforted by the fact that I'm familiar with my accommodations tonight. I'm checked into a hostel where I've stayed before and I'll be comfortable there. I can walk to the store and restaurant, take a nap and a shower and hopefully catch the season finale of The Bachelor. Tomorrow morning I'll be dropped of at the James River footbridge for a 13 mile slackpack. And I'll be hiking the first week alone, meeting up with River in Catawba VA for the 135 miles we have left in common. I'm excited about hiking with her again and she's bringing her car so it's 135 miles of slackpacking and showers and clean clothes! What more can a hiker want!","

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607958,"My flight landed early yesterday in Roanoke, shocking but true. I'm glad too because the gentleman who sat next to me on the first leg of my flight had gas, I think we all have experienced that a time or two unfortunately. By the time we landed in Roanoke I was really ready to be here. I texted Gary to let him know that I had my bag and I was curbside 10 minutes before our scheduled pick up and he called me right away to let me know that he was stuck in traffic and would be about 20 minutes late. No big deal I seized the opportunity to gaze at the blue skies and the amazing view that Roanoke airport has from a little bench curbside. The fresh air was absolutely awesome and 20 minutes passed too quickly. Gary was a great shuttle driver and remembered to bring the can of fuel that I had requested, and even had my change ready in anticipation that I'd be giving him $20 bills. He dropped me off promptly at the hostel and chitchated with Donna for a few minutes before departing. Donna introduced herself to me and came into the hostel with me and we spent a few minutes conversing as I was the only one here last night. She lost her husband a year ago in Sept. He was a shuttle driver and they both worked at the hostel. We arranged for my shuttle to the trail and it was decided, with Adam's suggestion that I would hike northbound from Thunder Ridge  to route 501 at the James River footbridge. being my first day back on trail after 3 months this would give me more downhill than climbing, and with the 13 plus mile day in front of me I was very happy that Adam thought to suggest that to me. after Donna left I settled for a $5 frozen pizza from the freezer which was absolutely crispy and delicious, and then walked down to the Dollar general and grabbed myself something for dinner and some frozen breakfast items as well as some colby jack cheese and Fritos. Back at the hostel, I settled in and relaxed, did some meditation and crawled into my bunk to take a nap around 5:30 after answering a message from my cousin who's going to be meeting me in the Smokeys. His engineer brain works so sophisticatedly that he has designed a couple of spreadsheets to follow along my hike and monitor my timing so he'll know when it's the right time for him to head out to meet me. He's also connected to my spot so he can track my progress daily. I got up around 7:20pm, spoke with Brian and threw my dinner in the oven settling in on the sofa to watch television, and with the place all to myself I got to watch what I wanted. Though I was disappointed in this week's episode of The bachelor, it seemed to be dragging out. I got myself ready for bed while the last few minutes of the show was on and I crawled into my bunk just after 10, laying there wide awake with my eyes closed willing myself to go to sleep. When all of a sudden there it was, loud as can be and my eyes flew open with a start.... the darn train! Are you kidding me? I'd forgotten somehow that every trail town from NY south seems to have a hostel right near the tracks. It did make me chuckle once the adrenaline stopped rushing and I closed my eyes again and willed harder to get sleep. I only had about 4 hours of sleep the night before. I really wanted this slumber!
I awoke around 4:10 and refused to get up, going back to sleep until just before 6. I turned off my alarm and practiced yoga to the calm, soothing voice of Rebecca at Prana Strong Yoga. Blissful! I readied for my day, had my breakfast and was good to go when Lee arrived at 7:30 to shuttle me to Thunder Ridge for my hike. He was chatty and interesting and he was also a cautious driver getting me safely to the lookout where the trail intersects. He walked out to the lookout with me, being such a clear and beautiful morning, where I snapped a selfie and headed out nobo towards the James River footbridge. Boy it felt great to be back on the trail! Bright blue sky, a few birds, the inevitable spider webs and brisk weather. I wore a hat, gloves and coat for a while. The ground was frozen solid and I saw a few spots with hoarfrost but no snow or ice. So glad I'm not carrying my microspikes. Thanks to the women in the Appalachian Trail women's group on Facebook who helped me with that dilemma! About an hour down the trail I shed my outer layer. I was climbing a bit and became toasty warm but I did dress and undress that outer layer a few more times until finally I turned a corner and was in the sunshine, protected from the breeze with soft ground beneath my feet. I saw no one, not a soul all day. One squirrel and a few birds were my only brief companions. I was completely fine with that, enjoying nature and the solitude. The closest I came to civilization in my 13 mile trek was an empty pickup truck at Petites Gap and the tap water in my backpack. I snacked but didn't stop to eat lunch until I crossed Matt's Creek and walked right into the shelter. I took a sunny seat at the picnic table and got right down to the business of Advil. Then I enjoyed some of the cheese and Fritos I bought at the dollar store and washed it down with some cherry blast Gatorade. Delicious! I was 2.2 miles to my shuttle location at route 501/James River footbridge and it was 1:15. I took a 40 minute lunch break then enjoyed the rest of the hike on fairly level trail and happier feet. The bridge was amazing. I admired the work of beavers just before walking across it and taking in the view. Before I reached the other side I could see the familiar site of the parking area where Frog had picked us up in October when I first stayed at Stanimals. I reached the parking lot at 2:40 and Donna was there waiting. She was picking up 2 other hikers also and they arrived around 3. Zorro and Feral, nobo class of 2019 who started in January from Springer and met on trail. Nice gentleman. At the hostel I took a hot shower and took the opportunity to wash my clothes. I know I've only been wearing them 2 days but it'll be Saturday before I do laundry again and I like being clean. While the guys devoured frozen pizza and waited for another hiker friend to arrive I walked down to Scottos restaurant and ate a chicken parmesan dinner with salad and garlic bread. Then I waddled back to the hostel meeting the guys along the way and being introduced to Villian with a V. Makes me wonder what he's been called.  I'm glad Puddles is pretty benign. I've only been mistaken for cuddles. Donna came in while I was writing this. I really like this woman. We talked for a few minutes about fate. I shared with her my experience with chaplain Mary the day after WE's mother passed away. When one of the guys came back we ended our chat and got back to business confirming my shuttle for tomorrow morning and cashing me out. I'm hoping that the guys won't mind if I watch the finale of the Bachelor tonight. I'm going to kindly request it. I've waited all season for this night!","Thunder Ridge lookout

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608121,"I went to bed around 9:15 skipping the rest of the Bachelor. As Brian described it, it was oversold and under delivered. The guys retired about the same time. I closed the door to my bunkroom and remembered that there's toilet in the closet. It's not something you'd use if there were other hikers in the room because it's a closet and you can't close the door to it if you're on the toilet because there's no room for your legs. But I was alone and delighted that I could use it in the middle of the night and not disturb anyone. And so I did. I slept much better and awoke just before my 6am alarm feeling refreshed and excited for the day. I dressed and packed up and joined the guys in the kitchen where I had the last breakfast sandwich I'd bought at the store and some decaf coffee. I was fueled and ready when Lee arrived to shuttle us. Yesterday Adam, the hostel owner, dropped off an SUV for the shuttle drivers. Its far better than the BMW sedan that was in use. Much more room for hikers and packs. The guys were dropped off at route 501/James River footbridge to continue north and we took some pictures together and exchanged contact info so we can follow each other and so I can have the opportunity to help them when they get to NH. Lee dropped me off at Thunder Ridge at just after 9am. The parking lot was buzzing with 15-20 trail maintainers gearing up to head north. We spoke briefly about the big tree I climbed over yesterday and that was in fact today's mission. I thanked them for their hard work and continued on my way south. Just before the turnout to the parking lot I saw a gorgeous owl perched on a limb not far from the road. A beautiful healthy looking owl and it reminded me to stop and look up more often on trail. So I did that as I hiked but I saw nothing interesting in the trees. A couple of nobo hikers passed me, one with earbuds in who nodded as he walked past and one who I talked with very briefly. I felt like I was crawling under the weight of my pack and I was also experiencing shoulder fatigue from it. I adjusted it several times in the first 2 miles, finally stopping at a shelter and taking it off to use the privy. I made some adjustments to have it sit more on my hips when I put it back on and it rode much better. I also took some Advil for the discomfort of my shoulders and feet. I had planned to stop at the next shelter for lunch as it was my halfway point but it was a way off trail and I'd already gone off trail to the black rock overlook so I skipped it and decided on another 1.8 miles to a tent site.  When I arrived at the tent site I met Eli and Cassidy out section hiking and I let them know that there was water ahead at the shelter behind me so they didn't have to hike down to the spring they were contemplating. With much relief they hiked on and finding the tent site unappealing I also hiked on until I found a comfortable fallen tree for my lunch break. I crushed my crackers and dumped them into my tuna packet gobbled it up before enjoying some of the leftover Fritos from yesterday. Eli and Cassidy spoke highly of Bryant Ridge shelter and even though I'd hoped to hike 2-3 miles beyond it to a campsite but I was tired and at 3:30 I arrived at the shelter and called it home. I claimed a corner of the first floor and unfolded my tyvek when I saw Brian. Well, the stick figure Brian which he had drawn on the corner of it with a note that says he's right beside me. So I put that corner up by my head and set up my sleeping gear. I was alone at the shelter and had completed all my chores before another hiker wandered in just before 5:30. I had my dinner soaking and had already enjoyed a coffee while observing the sites, sounds and smells of the area when Pack mule made his decision to stay the night and ultimately to sleep in the shelter as well. A nice guy but a bit too chatty for me. I hope he doesn't snore. He's a retired police officer which made me feel a little better until I realized he doesn't hang his food bag. When I mentioned it he said his food is all sealed up and the bears are still hibernating anyway, or so he believes. I'll be asking God for his extra protection tonight.","Thunder Ridge lookout

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608123,"Well, he snores. All night long I was in and out of sleep to the rythmn of Packmules snoring. I can say this, he doesn't have sleep apnea. At least I wasn't eaten by a bear! I got up around 7 and made my oatmeal and coffee before packing up to head out. Packmule carries a katadin filter like I used to and offered to fill my bottle so we went to the creek together and it became clear that his filter needed maintenance. I watched his face turn red with the strain of pumping and then showed him how to take it apart and lubricate the o ring on the handle and clean the strainer that goes into the water source. I'm hoping tonight he's sitting in a shelter doing that. I made my way down the trail after saying goodbye and about a half hour into my day  spotted 2 deer. We were equally curious about each other and watched each other until finally I started hiking again and they bounced off with their tails waving goodbye. Not long after that I stopped to observe 3 woodpeckers for a moment. I climbed a lot today. Several climbs, stopping often to let my heart calm down an octave. I could hear it constantly pounding in my ears. I felt like it was never going to end! And even though my bag's at least a pound lighter because I've been eating it somehow felt heavier. I came upon an older man on one of the few downs of the day, just before bearwallow gap. He was sitting on a rock wearing a pack as big as Packmule's looking depleted. I chatted with him and learned he's 66 and out for 12 days to see how it would be to attempt a thru hike in 2021. His trail name is Major Disaster. It seemed fitting based on my brief observation. I grabbed water at the gap, having just emptied my water bladder and took a 10 minute break before my next and last climb. I was 3 miles from the shelter and when I reached the top I could without a doubt tell the predicted storm was blowing in. It was scary windy and made me anxious to get to the shelter. As I crossed the blue ridge parkway at the peaks of otter lookout the wind caught me and pushed me back a step. On the other side the trail tipped slightly down off the ridge and protected me enough from the wind that I stopped and seeing I had cell service texted Brian a quick update and reminded him he's loved. When I finally reached the shelter it seemed really protected from the wind. 2 hikers were at the picnic table. Twice who is a thru hiker from Germany and a section hiker from Ohio named Sand Bag. I set up in the shelter and we all had dinner and conversation together before hanging our food bags. Twice chose to tent and Sandbag claimed the opposite end of the shelter.  I might actually be able to sleep tonight and not worry about bears!","
",Bobblets Gap Shelter,"Mar 14, Thu",13.50
Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608148,"I slept a little better last night, still getting numb on my side and having to roll over quite a bit then choosing to sleep on my stomach for a while. I feel like I was semi awake most of the night and I could hear sand bag lightly snoring but nothing compared to packmule. I started getting dressed under my quilt a little after 7, and I was the last one to leave camp being the only one who ate breakfast. I departed around 8:15 heading South toward fullhardt shelter. With the climbing yesterday and also today I started to feel like I was getting blisters on my heels even though I had put leukotape on them before leaving stanimals hostel on Tuesday as a precaution. With the ascent my heel rubs on the back inside of my boot and to prevent the friction I wear liner socks with wool socks and the tape was an added layer. I stopped at Wilson Creek shelter for lunch but decided not to take my boots off to look. I think I kind of already knew but didn't want to have to deal with it until I was in for the night. there were several ups and downs in today's hike and many of the shelters are dry because they are at the top of mountains and The Creeks are down below so I refilled my water when the opportunity and necessity arose and I drank 2 liters today and was very thirsty. The forecast I saw in Glasgow was rain last night and all day today 80%. Lucky for me it didn't rain last night and while I did get caught in a quick shower today I stopped right away, covered my pack and myself with rain gear. The pain from my feet made it very difficult to hike today and I took Advil at every opportunity I had. I also listened to music to try to keep my mind off it.  None the less the pain continued and about two and a half miles from fullhardt shelter I called Brian for some moral support. I was contemplating if I saw a tent spot to claim it for the night and not hike as far as I had planned because to get to the shelter I had one more steep climb in front of me. After talking with Brian I decided to rest for a few minutes as often as needed during the last mile of ascent. My last rest was at 4 tenths of a mile or halfway through my final climb. It was made more difficult because I was carrying extra water for tonight and tomorrow morning. These mountain top shelters don't have water and although the one I was heading to uses a sistern to collect rain water from the roof I had no way to know if it had any in it. So I lugged 2 liters up the mountain, an extra 4.5 lbs of water. When I arrived at the shelter it was vacant. It's an older shelter but clean and the privy was a short walk that is void of elevation thank goodness! The wind however blows right into the shelter and thus I went to the privy to contemplate putting up my tent or staying in the shelter. I've heard the bathroom is a good place to think. ? I decided to sleep in a corner of the shelter that had the most protection from the wind and set up shop, located the sistern and confirmed it has water. This means I can use an extra cup of water and have vanilla pudding with chocolate chips! Which I did of course, before my dinner. No regrets. I also chose soup for dinner which uses 2 cups of water. I feel I need the water intake and it just sounded better than black beans and rice tonight. I'm thankful that the shelter has a metal plate in one corner of the floor. I can safely use my stove on it and I would otherwise have to eat cold because the wind would make it impossible to use my stove on the picnic table. I haven't seen anyone all day. I undressed my feet and got my safety pin, sanitizer and bandages out. Sitting at the picnic table dressed in my wool leggings and top I examined the specimens and performed the needed task of popping and bandaging and then taping the bandages with leukotape. I have 5 miles into Daleville tomorrow morning and I will get a room, get some epsom salts and call it a nero so I can take care of me. A shower, first aid and much needed sleep. I'm really looking forward to it! But for tonight I have my pepper blaster by my pillow, thanks to one of my clients whom I also consider a friend. I wish she wasn't moving so far away and I hope now that we have the fifth wheel we will see her again. She gave me the pepper blaster and I love having it with me when I'm alone. You just never know when the bears will wake up hungry.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608237,"I might have gotten a couple of hours of sleep last night but I'm not even sure of that. The wind howled and branches were flying as the temperature plummeted from 61 to the mid 30's. I went to bed around 7 and watched the sun set and the lights come up from Daleville down below. It was quite peaceful despite the wind and I felt almost like I was spying on the city below. Did anyone even know I was on the top of this mountain watching the bustle below? The sound of the distant train whistle mixing with the rush of the wind. Twinkling lights. After 9 I made a trip to the privy. It seems I'm well hydrated now. Sometime after that I noticed a chill on my head and so I got up and feeling the significant change in the temperature I dawned my hat, neck warmer and puffy before crawling back into bed. The wind howled louder as the night progressed and the symphony of dry leaves being blown about in front of the shelter and sticks and branches falling from above onto the metal roof kept me forever alert and a good sleep never came. As the sun rose a little after 7am so did I. How I longed to sleep but I knew it would come better in town. With my mittens on and off while I packed up I squeezed a packet of peanut butter and 2 packets of jelly into my mouth and washed that down with a serving of trail mix. I skipped brushing my teeth because it was just too cold to have my mittens off. Sorry Mom! I headed out of camp at 8:15 after getting a liter from the sistern. It was cold and windy most of the 5 miles into town and though I stopped to take my gloves off I would put them back on just a few minutes later when the trail turned into the face of the wind again. I came upon a sign informing me that the next .6 mile of trail is on private property and at the time in the field to the left 6 deer stopped to study me. I stopped too and when I resumed moving 5 of them dashed away. A small doe stood and watched me for another moment before running off to catch up with the others. It was a fantastic hike into town and the sun warmed me up so I was able to shed my hat, neck warmer and mittens for the last mile or so. I saw 3 hikers within that last mile, all day hikers. I was so happy to see town!I strolled into the Super 8 motel and scored a room for 2 nights. I was too tired to think about how things will work over the next 2 days. River is coming up on the 17th after her last piece of TN and she has 6 miles between route 311 and 4 pines hostel to do. I've got 19.8 miles to get to the same spot and it includes Tinkers Cliffs and McAfee  Knob.  Big climbs. 3 months ago I could hike that in a day but right now I know it would push me too much. After chatting with Brian about it I agreed with his suggestion that I leave in the morning and hike about half of the miles, carry a lighter pack and stay at a shelter. Then complete the remaining miles the following day so that River and I both end up on route 311. In my room I showered, brushed my teeth (finally!) and ordered a pizza. I thought I was calling Pizza Hut but I was calling Domino's. I was so tired I didn't care. I just wanted someone to bring food. Within 30 minutes my pizza was delivered I was clean and my laundry was in the wash. After I ate the pizza and finished my laundry I walked down to the shopping plaza and picked up some water treatment drops at the outfitters and snacks and epsom salts at Kruger. I also bought some zzzquil. No more sleepless shelter nights for me!I napped briefly and got to talk to Kyle for a few minutes and update him on my journey. Then I ate a steak dinner at the Mexican restaurant next door before soaking my feet for a second time. I'm planning on a good solid sleep tonight.","Fullhardt Shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608329,"Wow! I slept very well last night and I really needed it. After filling up with a steak dinner and a huge helping of steamed fresh broccoli and cauliflower, and flan for dessert at Pancho's restaurant I retired to my room and organized my bag with only what I need for the one shelter hop. Then I talked to River about the plan and texted with WE who's back on trail down in the  Franklin NC area today. Go ladies! I called Brian to say goodnight and took a dose of zzzquil at 9pm and it was lights out shortly after. I woke up at 3 and went back to sleep until 6:45. I'd like to do that every night!
I was getting dressed and feeling good looking forward to my 9.4 miles today with a lighter pack and how much more enjoyable it would be. I unpacked and repacked my bag making sure I had everything I need with me and took another look at the AT shelter weather for Lambert's Meadow. 32° tonight with winds 3-6mph. Feeling satisfied with both I went to the lobby to eat breakfast and leave a room key for River. At 8:15 I started walking. In the first half mile I came across a trail runner and his standard poodle who seemed to be playing catch me if you can with his master. He passed me from behind and we said good morning. A little while later and more than a mile into the day I stopped on a log and adjusted my boot laces. I'm guessing here is where I got turned around. Yes, that's right I hiked in the wrong direction. I didn't realize it until I stopped to look at a sign that was facing away from me. It said Dragon's tooth was 9.8 miles behind me and I concluded immediately it must be wrong, until I looked at Guthooks and saw I was .7 miles from the hotel I left an hour and a half ago. I sighed and turned around and dragged myself up the hill I'd just hiked down. Oh well. The rest of the morning was awesome. The sky was blue and the breeze mild. I saw 2 other people with dogs including a man with a golden retriever named Nicco who was very well trained and the man with the poodle who stopped to talk with me. I was embarrassed about my confusion and I'm glad it's the first time and I hope the last. I've met a hiker named wrong way and I totally understand now. The man with Nicco told me he thinks these 20 miles are the best. So far I'd agree. I enjoyed the views from the power lines and the rock outcrops as well as the ridge walk where I could see the water on my left and towns on my right. I took my time, finally. Not caring how many miles I hike an hour or how many times I stop and just stand still and look around. Where the gas line goes through I found a rock to sit on and took my boots off to let my feet get air. I was just 4 miles from the shelter at noon. I'd rather enjoy each spot I feel like along the trail than to sit at a shelter trying to convince myself not to hike to the next one. At 1:30 I stopped at the cliffs to have lunch and enjoy the view. Brian and I had a little Marco Polo video fun and then I sat quietly watching the crows float by on the thermals and looking at the homes and cars below. The pastures and forests. Just peaceful all of it was from up there. I met Pop tart and Pacemaker at an overlook and they warned me about a skunk ahead but I didn't see him. A mile and a half later I arrived at Lambert's Meadow shelter. I was alone and I enjoyed the time soaking my feet in the creek, watching the nuthatch on the nearby tree and the black eyed juncos picking thru the leaves. I enjoyed a hot cup of coffee and was soaking my black beans and rice dinner which I wasn't looking forward to. I saved it for last and now I had no choice. I was lamenting over it when Chief and Wonderhuven arrived for the night. We ate dinner together and talked. Chief lives in Knoxville TN and might be home when I hike through the Smokey's and if so he'd like to provide some trail magic. He and his wife own a bakery call Nothing Bunt Cakes. After dinner Wrong Way arrived. How ironic! So we're 4 deep in the shelter tonight and it's going to be cold. I feel better not being alone after the wind storm I went thru the other night. I took 2 zzzquil and laid down at 7:15 hoping for the best. I'm really looking forward to Tinker Cliffs and McAfee knob tomorrow. The weather is supposed to be gorgeous again. There's trash in the bear box that some other hikers left. I'm hiking 10 tomorrow so I will pack it out with me.","Daleville route 220

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608333,"Well I slept like crap. I'm frustrated by my inability to get a good night's sleep at a shelter. I sleep well in my tent, it's my sanctuary. But in the shelter I'm conscious of my tossing and turning all night and it's colder in the shelter and unprotected from the wind. I think I kept everyone slept poorly based on the conversation in the morning and I think I was the culprit. The moon was bright all night also, and I got up to use the privy twice but didn't need a headlamp. We were all up just after 7am. Chief and Wonderhuven left around 8 having planned a 20 mile day. I had breakfast and finished packing up along with Wrong Way. My heels are so tender to the touch I had to take my sleeping socks off last night. They were causing my heels to throb. I can't stand the thought of wearing my hiking boots and I was mentioning to Wrong Way that I was tempted to hike in my Crocs and he mentioned he's seen several people do that temporarily because of blisters. So I put my boots in my pack and hiked out in Crocs thinking I'd try it the 1.5 miles to Tinker Cliffs. While hiking in Crocs is slower I was pain free and able to 100% enjoy todays hike. I wore them for the entire 10.4 miles. I was alone at Tinker Cliffs and the views were splendid. I felt very emotional as I've been looking forward to this section of the trail for so long. I took my time at the cliffs thoroughly soaking it in before moving forward. Just a few steps up the trail I heard a little rustling in the dry leaves and looked to see 5 deer foraging for acorns among them. They were conscious of me and I took several photos before I proceeded past them. They continued their business. I stopped at the shelter just .7 from McAfee knob and had a snack and used the privy before continuing my climb. At the knob there were a handful of people and a woman was kind enough to take my photo. There were surprisingly many section and day hikers out on this section and I spoke with several. River would be proud of me, she's usually the social one and I generally greet but move on. Even though the climax of today's hike was now behind me I still enjoyed every bit of it pain and stress free. It's been nice hiking shorter days and enjoying more but I'm also looking forward to hiking and sharing time with River over the next week. About a half mile from route 311 I spoke with a couple having a snack on the side of the trail. Just before I departed he noticed I was hiking in Crocs. I explained why and he said he ended a 400 mile section hike because of heel blisters and he had Crocs with him but regrets not thinking about hiking in them. I continued down toward the road where River met me with a whoop and a cold beer that we shared in the parking lot. It's so good to see her and I'm looking forward to the week ahead. We went back to the Super 8 where I showered and then we went to the 3 Little Pigs for dinner and discussed our plans for the week of hiking. With everything carved out I soaked my feet, said goodnight to Brian before journaling and sinking into bed.","Lambert's Meadow shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608596,I slept very well indeed. Finally! River and I got up and ready and had breakfast before departing to drop her car at the end of a 15 mile stretch of trail that would take us up and over dragon's tooth. At the parking lot we were met by Pepper Jack who drove us to the starting point of our hike. It was really great to see him and I bet he never thought he'd see me again. I was so sick when he drove me to acupuncture and finally to Richmond to fly home back in October. We said goodbye at the trailhead and wished him the best and then started our 2.5 mile ascent to the famed tooth. It was sunny but chilly for the climb but as the temps warmed we stopped to adjust our layers. We had the tooth to ourselves when we arrived and took the time to climb around on the rocks and snap some pictures. It was good fun. Just as we were leaving some day hikers with dogs reached the top and River and I headed south over the ridge.  As we walked along the ridge we met flip flop thru hikers Mountain man and Michelle Gypsy mccann and we had a nice conversation with them before moving on and meeting Topo. (Tali Hunt) In women's face book group. As it turns out Topo is a backpacking instructor with a group called Adventures in Good Company which is where River's Appalachian Trail dream was born. After the ridge walk we had a 4 mile climb. It was a long slow burn up the 4 miles to a memorial for a WWII veteran named Audie Murphy. At the top there were 2 random benches spaced about 200' apart. We sat on them and laughed together. So strange to see them and we could have used them to rest along the climb but here they were at the top just at the descent. Finally it was down hill to the car. It was a gorgeous sunny afternoon and when we finished we headed back towards Daleville stopping first at Kroger for a few items and then for dinner at Pancho's before getting to the room. After a shower and  some logistics on the hike and planning when to move and where it was 10pm. A late night for me. It'll be a short sleep and almost 17 miles tomorrow.,"Route 624

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608607,"I didn't sleep as we last night, waking up at 4 to go pee and not really sleeping after  I got out of bed at 5:45 am and started getting ready. Today's a long day and everything had to go in the car because we're checking out of here and into a new place tonight.  We had breakfast again in the lobby before checking out and heading to the trail. I dropped River at 621 where we ended yesterday and she began hiking south towards route 601.  I headed to route 601 where I would start hiking north towards her. When she got to 601 she'd pick up the car and come get me at route 621. That was the plan, except it didn't go as smoothly as we'd hoped. It's very rural here and River's car doesn't have navigation so there are 2 other options being a map or cell phone navigation. And neither one did we have. River left her map book of VA back in Michigan. No help there. It's very rural here and cell service is rare. Route 601 is a state road but it's a gravel mountain road not maintained in winter. Sounds like fun right? So I had directions but that didn't work well because I had to drive around the mountains, sort of north and then southwest in order to go southeast. 2 hours later I found it! At 10am and fully irritated but somewhat relieved I began hiking my butt off! I saw no one all day except River who I met up with between 1-2pm. We gave each other a trail report of what to expect based the miles behind each of us and hiked on. I stopped only for 10 minutes at a road crossing before a big climb for a bite to eat. It was just before I saw River. I wanted to be out of the woods before dusk and I also didn't want to keep River waiting. I'd enjoyed my part of the trail so far, some nice pastures and rhododendron tunnels but it was a lot of climbing. I'd been looking forward to the ridge walk all day but River's description wasn't impressive. And she was less descriptive than what I actually encountered on the ridge. It was crappy with a lot of sloped walking on the side of the ridge not on top and it included walking on sloped rock slabs. The way this twists your feet and ankles is hard on the body. The views were nice but I'd rather have better trail and what I'd looked forward to all day I couldn't wait to end. I hiked as fast as I could over that ridge and down the other side.  I could feel new blisters forming on my feet in the last few miles but I couldn't stop. I made it to the parking lot around 6pm and River was there to pick me up with a cold body armor drink for me. She was outside her car talking with a section hiker she'd met on her hike. Highlander offered us each a PBR and I was a bit dehydrated so I took mine and saved it for later. River drank hers while we talked. We said goodbye to Highlander and his hiking buddy bamboo and were on our way to the MacArthur Inn located in Narrows VA. It was late and we stopped at Hardee's for dinner, gassed up the car and grabbed a hot coffee from McDonald's before arriving at McArthur's. River was already in the lobby when I opened the door with my backpack and full hands and smelled the cigarette smoke. I could almost see the blue haze from it. River was talking with Alan who might be the proprietor and he was not in possession of the reservation which was made for 4 nights. Quickly thinking River advised we'd stay the one night and maybe more but we weren't sure of our plans yet. She requested a non smoking room And Allen informed her that the entire motel is non-smoking and if anyone is caught smoking they will be asked to leave. River and I just looked at each other in quandary. Alan walked us to our room on the second floor and when he open the door we were surprised by a very large room with fairly new furniture and it looks clean and inviting. we settled in and as usual one of the first orders of business is to check for bed bugs. So river lifted up her mattress and everything was spotless between the mattress and the box spring so we unpacked showered and by 10 another late night we were both in bed. It was probably 11 by the time the lights and TV were off and I was asleep.","Route 601 Rocky Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608684,"The alarm sounded before 6 and we got up. When I came out of the bathroom River had found something of concern and thus after examination we determined that would be our only night here. I've never seen River pack up so quickly. It was astonishing! Within minutes everything was in the car and before 6:30 we were at McDonald's. I suggested that we check into Angel's Rest Hostel and I'd heard nothing but positive reviews about the place. I know River prefers the privacy of a hotel room but Angel's Rest has private rooms also. She texted them and by 6:45 we were confirmed in private rooms in the brick ranch. We ate our breakfast and I packed out a McMuffin for a snack later. 
River dropped me at 8:45 and I began hiking north from Peter's Mountain trailhead on Big Stoney Creek Rd towards route 601 where I'd pick up the car and meet her where I started. I enjoyed my first few miles despite the fact that it was about 7 miles of elevation. The first part along the creek in the rhododendron forest was very pleasant and later the mossy rock forest I enjoyed as well. When I got to Wind Rock I was surprised to see River already, I thought it would be another hour. Her hike she said was really fast and nice despite a slow burning climb. I'd been thinking about the Smokey's and wondering if I'd be ready for them. I don't know why I'm doubting myself, I've hiked so far and over more difficult terrain and in extreme weather conditions.  Today once again I'd gotten to hike the direction that produced the most climbing and it was my choice to hike nobo. Ugh! My feet were burning and my blisters were so extremely painful with every step that I really had to consider the physical and mental effect. I called Brian and talked to him as I left tears on the trail. I was feeling defeated but he gave me the support and love and encouragement as he always does and it brought me back around. In the last half mile I wanted to take my boots off and walk in my socks. The climb was steep and my heels pressed into my boots with every single move. I decided then that I couldn't hike tomorrow. I have to take care of me. I have 4 weeks to go after River finishes hiking with me on Monday and I've hiked 10 days without a day off. I changed into my Crocs at the car and headed out to get River. I thought she would be waiting a long time for me but when I arrived at Peter's mountain trailhead she'd only been waiting half an hour and the rain was very light. We both stayed dry today! We went back to the McArthur to pay for last night and express our experience to Alan who was kind and alarmed and genuinely concerned. River's reservation had arrived for the 4 nights but Alan agreed to the one night only. There was a dinner benefit going on and the food smelled great. I asked what it was for and he explained for his ex-wife who was being treated for non Hodgkin's lymphoma. River gave a donation and we left to find a laundromat. We wanted to wash everything before checking into the Angel's Rest. By the time laundry was done I was starving and we opted for Hardee's again which was less than a mile from the hostel. I let River know I was not hiking tomorrow but I'd slack pack her.  When we arrived at Angel's rest we we're so kindly greeted and shown to our private rooms and then walked to the office to check in and pay. The 2 dogs there kept licking at my open blisters making me feel uncomfortable. Poor babies know I'm in sorry shape right now. I showered and talked with Brian before getting into bed at 10. I'll be up at 6 again but with the day off I'll be able to nap and take care of my feet. After I pick River up I'll make us dinner since we have access to the full kitchen.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608682,"I slept very well in my own private room with no TV or lights to distract me. My alarm went off at 6am and I got up and got ready to bring River to the trailhead. The wind was howling outside and I was glad I would be resting today. We headed out to McDonald's but as we were about to turn in River and I decided we deserved a better breakfast and so she pulled a quick turn in the opposite direction and we landed at Friends and Family restaurant. We enjoyed fresh omelets and coffee before I finally left her at the trailhead for Peter's mountain and watched her hike away bundled from head to toe against the piercing wind. I returned to town and stopped at the Food Lion (which I think is a really weird name for a grocery store) where I bought a kale salad, fresh broccoli and asparagus, a pork roast, sweet potato, eggs, bacon, bread and butter along with a few other items. I unpacked them all at the hostel which is conveniently located right behind the store, soaked my feet and I worked on my journal. I had lunch around 1 and then laid down for a nap. At 3pm my phone woke me up so I got up and worked on what the next couple of weeks might look like in my AWOL guide until I just couldn't see anymore. I don't have my glasses with me and sometimes that's really difficult. The house was quiet all day and I left to get River before 5pm. I waited about 10 minutes for her at the trailhead, perfect timing. When we got back to the hostel River showered and relaxed while I made dinner. It was a treat to have a fresh home cooked meal. After dinner I went to Rite Aid and bought a pair of reading glasses and now my life is much better! We shared 2 beers and visited with our house mate Carolyn. She's section hiking with her friend Saffire and they're both from TN. Very nice ladies and Carolyn is 68, such an inspiration. After a little more work in my AWOL I was too tired to think and around 9pm I retreated to my bedroom for a dose of melatonin and my pillow. I'm looking forward to getting back on trail tomorrow and my blisters are looking nice and dry now.","

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608836,"It was really good to have a day off and I felt energized and fresh this morning. We made omelets at the house for breakfast with some leftover veggies from last night and River cooked some of the bacon. Carolyn asked me to help her stretch so I did that after I ate. River dropped me off at Clendennon and Pocahontas and I was off and running. Well not really running, that's just a figure of speech. The hike was really nice in the beginning with lots of rhododendron and just kind of bumping along. It was very cold and windy today and early in I wore my hat and gloves. I stopped at Rice mountain shelter and used the privy. The shelter and campsite in front of it share the nicest view of the day but the cold wind had me snapping a quick picture and moving on. 5 miles later I stopped for lunch at a campsite by a meadow and I saw Carolyn and Saffire walking towards me hiking this section sobo. They called home and then joined me for lunch. Their company was really nice. Before we could all get too cold we finished up and hiked off. The rest of my hike today was up and down, finally down. I passed by a couple of day hikers looking for the Allegheny Trail and I let them know they were almost there. When I made it down to the Peter's mountain trailhead parking area I sat in the sun on a stump and worked on my journal. Within a few minutes I was joined by Hobbit, a nobo thru hiker. He was headed to the next shelter on the trail via the road which he said he finds more scenic.  He said he's a thru hiker. At the end of the day I want to be considered a thru hiker and know that I passed by every white blaze, by the rules. 
A few minutes after Hobbit hit the road the day hikers I'd met earlier came down to the parking area and asked if I needed a ride. They were Lynn and Sammy and we had a great chat which continued when River arrived. My 45 minute wait for her flew by! We decided to have dinner at Friends and Family restaurant and it was just okay. We even had dessert and when my slice of butterscotch pie showed up in a bowl looking like it had been dumped on the floor and then scooped up it made me feel terrible about ordering dessert. I looked at River's perfect slice of lemon meringue pie and wanted to steal it from her. She had just asked me which was more stressful, owning restaurants or being a real estate broker. Looking at this thing called dessert in front of me I realized I would never have allowed that to be served in my restaurants. Yes, I ate it but I didn't enjoy it. Presentation is more than 50% of how something tastes. We returned to the hostel and went to the office to stamp our passports and get our vortex patches before showering. I stretched Carolyn again before retreating to the peaceful sanctuary of my private room around 9. I was really tired after today's cold and wind. Tomorrow we leave here and head to Bland.","Clendennon and Pocahontas Rd

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608854,"I didn't sleep as well last night  I should have taken some more melatonin at 1:30 when I woke for a trip to the bathroom. But I dragged myself up when my alarm went off and got ready for the day. Today we checked out of the hostel. River asked if she could see if we could stay another night and I said no right away because I want to get to Bland. I actually have no clue what is in Bland but I know this....I have a secret. I have been talking to WE and she and Lee are going to be at the Big Walker motel in Bland but River doesn't know. I wanted to surprise her.  On the way to drop River off at the trailhead on Kimberling Creek route 606 I saw a red cardinal on the right side of the road. We also saw an Amish family in their horse drawn buggy headed out to church. After I dropped her and was driving to my trailhead at Sugar Run Rd I saw 3 more all on the same side of the road. I also saw a group of Amish men walking, not far from the location we saw the buggy, presumably walking to church. I've heard there's an Amish owned deli around here somewhere. I hope I get the chance to visit it.Not long into my hike which again was a beautiful path with rhododendron I stopped at Doc's knob shelter. I used the privy first since it was conveniently located next to the trail and I found it nice and clean with a fresh roll of TP in a Ziploc bag. As I sat I studied the 4 posters on the walls and door educating me on snakes, wildflowers, butterflies and aquatic insects. I might not actually be any more intelligent now than before my stop and I spent more time in the privy than required for my business but I did take a picture of the snake poster and I hope I don't have to refer to it. I've seen plenty of snakes and checked off that box!  I had lunch at Pearis ledges and no one was around. I nearly got caught peeing after lunch when day hikers started appearing. It was a close call! I began descending and stopped briefly at Angel's Rest rock for a photo. By now I'd been passed by at least 25 hikers. When I thought the coast was clear I stopped at a rock and stripped off a shirt and my tights  it was really warm today and I needed to get cooler before my upcoming climb. The rest of the hike was kind of brown and boring. Nothing notable just logging miles. Not far from my finish I spooked a groundhog and he waddled off blending in with the brown foliage that covered the area. I passed by a chemical plant and took a road walk before entering the woods again and passing a landfill. Just inside the woods I encountered my favorite kind of day hikers. 3 unleashed dogs with bad manners. One named Rocky jumped on me and when I saw a hiker up the trail by the landfill I let him know they were ahead. He didn't seem to be looking forward to the encounter either. I love dogs but there is something called trail edecit which doesn't seem to be well known. Leash your dogs when you see other people on the trail. These people had no leashes with them and even after Rocky jumped on me he continued to hike with me for several hundred yards before they could get him under verbal control.I arrived at Clendennon and Pocahontas at 5pm and seated myself on a rock beside the road. 2 minutes later a jogger crossed the road and headed up the trail as a farmer was driving by and shouted out his window checking to make sure all was well with me. Very nice of him. When River arrived we set the GPS for Bland and I secretly texted with WE to keep her posted on our ETA. I was really wanting ice cream so we stopped at a Burger King and I ran in for an Oreo shake. Yum! I continued to text WE and when we arrived and were in the lobby they came in and surprised River. It was wonderful to see them and snuggle with Romeo. We ordered pizza delivered and sat around the table in their room enjoying each other's company along with wine, beer and food. Around 9 I wandered off to bed with a full belly a light head. Life is really good and I'm so blessed for these people who have helped me with my hike. I'm looking forward to helping WE when she's in NH and Maine this summer and perhaps hike a few miles with her.","Sugar Run Rd

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608858,"We said goodbye to WE and Lee and Romeo this morning and had breakfast in the room. It's been several days since I've had oatmeal and I feel like I'm at a point where I will need a break from it when I finish the trail. Especially if it's in a quart size freezer Ziploc! River dropped me at route 611 and from the trailhead at the top of the mountain I could see the sunrise over the distant mountains. It was really beautiful and there was noticably more bird chatter this morning. I brought my MP3 player today but the battery is dead. I decided after hearing the birds that I was happy about that. I called Brian to say good morning and hear his voice. It was a memorable moment just the way the day was opening up. I enjoyed starting off with just one shirt and no extra outerwear because today was warmer in the morning. Today was a quick 9.6 miles and we hiked early to be done by noon and avoid the afternoon rain. Today I have mixed emotions. It's my last day of hiking with River. She's almost done and she saved 10.8 miles down by Damascus to hike with her wife and Dad. I'm so happy for her and I know she's ready to be done with the trail. I'll miss her company, the planning together, knowing she's near at night and in the morning and sometimes during the day. There's no one I know now on trail down here. It'll be different and I'll be just fine, but it just won't be the same. It's funny really because we both wanted to hike the entire trail alone. Yet God had a different plan and it was perfect. Even how our hikes got messed up and we had this past week of hiking together covering 103.4 miles. We didn't plan it, but God did and I'm glad. WE and River have been the best of friends and hiking partners and I feel we share a special bond. We cared for each other out here every day and shared pain and glory. They're my family now and I look forward to seeing them both again. So the Virginia blues for this hiker are different. Today I was on trail with River for the last time and it was emotional to think about it as I hiked knowing it would be the last time I see her with her purple leggings and plaid kilt. We met around halfway and hugged as my eyes welled. Then we hiked on to the end of our day so we could be done before the rain. I climbed up to the ridge and saw a brief view where the power lines crossed. The ridge walk went on a while and when I stopped to rest my behind signaled an urgency. I'd passed up a privy at Jenny knob shelter because it was a downhill trail and I thought my body would wait but it was done waiting now. I climbed across the ridge top and over some barbed wire finding a spot by a tree and digging my cat hole. I was actually at a nice little campsite I would never have known was there. Things were over quickly and I covered my business and hiked on feeling much better.  As I hiked down off the ridge toward route 606 I could hear cows in the distance and I listened for them all the way down. I took a quick rest on a log drinking water and eating beef jerky but the water from the motel tasted a little like sulfur. I was struggling and then I realized that a half mile from the trailhead where the car is there's Trent's store. I boogied down and arrived at the car at noon and drove the half mile to Trent's where I scored a Snapple and an ice cream sandwich. Then I was off to pick up River for the last time. I arrived at her location at 12:25 just as the rain was starting to fall and she was waiting for me with her Mary Poppins umbrella. I'll miss that too as strange as it is to see a backpacker with an umbrella! We drove to the post office and picked up my food drop from Brian then showered and I packed my day bag, fleece and a few other things into a box and we shipped it out to Brian on our way to Wytheville to do laundry and have dinner. When the laundry was done we enjoyed steak and beer then stopped at McDonald's for a coffee to bring back to the room. If you don't already know, I wear my wool leggings and top on laundry day if I'm not wearing my rain gear. They look like pajamas and I call them that. Sometimes I forget how silly I must look. As we left the restaurant discussing coffee and relaxing in the room I told River I might even put my pajamas on (which of course I'm already wearing) and we almost peed laughing in the lobby. I'll miss laughing with her too. We did relax in the room with our coffee catching up on journaling until 7:30 when we wandered down to DQ for dessert and watched The Voice.","Route 611

While getting ready I realized that the supplements that came in my box yesterday were wrong. I'm missing my morning pills. I texted Brian to have him overnight them to Lickskillet hostel where I'm planning to stay tonight. We were ready and out the door at 6:45 and at the Circle K across the street getting coffee, something for me to drink on trail and waiting for DQ to open. Yes, DQ for breakfast and not ice cream. I had a biscuit with egg, cheese and bacon and it was pretty good. It was a 50 minute drive to the trailhead at Sugar Run Rd and River and I had good conversation reminiscing about our time together on trail and thinking about what's to come. It was a tearful goodbye as we hugged each other and expressed our feelings. She drove away honking her horn as I hiked away and I went from tears to laughter in an instant. 
It was cold and raining in the mid 30's and I wore my rain jacket. It wasn't a real rain but more the mist of walking thru clouds and the dripping off the trees. I hiked up towards the summit of Sugar Run Mt and kept my pace quick in order to stay warm. For a few minutes I regretted not having my hat and mittens but within 20 minutes I was toasty warm. I declined the added side trail to the actual summit since it was foggy and well honestly I didn't want to hike extra. Just after I began descending I ran into Firefly and Owl who asked me if I was River's hiking partner. We chatted about their intent to hike VT in late April and May and I wondered how mud season will work for them. Two other section hikers passed by after that but I didn't stop to talk. By 11:30 I was at Wapiti shelter having lunch. The weather was better so I traded my rain jacket for my puffy and after a 20 minute break I headed on. 2 tenths of a mile past the shelter I ran into a 4 way intersection with no blazes. I looked around and walked around for a good 10 minutes checking each direction and settled on the wrong one first but with the use of Guthooks map I finally got it right. Just past the small pond I found 3 guys sitting on the side of the trail.  Guilt trip, sauce and young buck asked me if I were River's hiking partner also. We talked a few and as I headed off to stay warm  Kbar passed by me and I told him his friends were waiting. The rest of the 8 miles to route 606 were flat and easy. The hike did have everything River promised though, rhododendron and pine forests, mud and washed out trail. When I finally had cell service 2 miles from the road I texted Mongo from Lickskillet Hostel to let him know that I was 2 hours early. When I got to the road he was there.  He drove me to Walker Valley Market and deli which is Amish run and I got 2 fresh sandwiches, chips and lemonade. When we arrived at the hostel he showed me around, introduced me to his dog Mister and I settled in, ate a sandwich and watched Netflix. I'm the only one here tonight and there's just a couple of small electric heaters but I'll be warm enough. The potty is outside though so I'm hoping I don't have a 2am wake up call from my bladder! Brian sent my supplements out this morning thru USPS but unfortunately they won't guarantee overnight delivery. If they don't come tomorrow I'll have to think about what to do.

I woke up before midnight and finally at 12:30 listened to my bladder and dawned my headlamp for a jaunt to the porta potty. I returned to bed but every noise kept me awake. I comforted myself by remembering God is with me and keeping me safe. I eventually fell back asleep until my 6:30 alarm woke me. I dressed and packed up what I needed for my day. Mongo came in and made eggs and croissant for breakfast. I noticed he didn't eat and I asked him. He's been fasting. I can only imagine how hard it was to cook and watch me eat. He said grace before I indulged. He had me at the trailhead at route 615 at 8:30 and my plan was to hike nobo 15.8 miles and get picked up at 611. It was 25° when I got out of the car and I stopped a few feet into the hike to put on my hat and gloves and turn on my spot. The first 7 miles were pretty easy and by 11:15 I was at Brushy Mountain Outpost ordering a fried pork tenderloin sandwich with fries. I guess it's a true southern thing and it was recommended so I went for it. It took a while to get it and while I was waiting I observed the owners who were caring for 2 grandchildren while running their small business. It's a reminder of how my son Kyle took his first steps at one of my restaurants and how difficult it is sometimes to make a living and care for your family at the same time. I felt like I wanted to jump in a feed the infant but I'm sure they would have thought I was a crazy sweaty hiker. I washed my lunch down with a strawberry crush soda, used the restroom and exited toward the trail with a serious food baby. I looked longingly at the neighboring picnic tables at the wayside. What I would give to nap there while I digest. But it wasn't to be and thus I continued hiking. The duration of the hike was a continuous series of hiking up and down camel humps. Seriously irritating steep ups and downs that were made more difficult initially because of my full belly and later because the nerve in my foot that was quieted back in July by a big needle is once again waking. Oh Joy. I popped 3 Advil and took my time, texting Mongo when I was a couple of miles from the road. I got there 20 minutes early and sat on a stump in the sun. When Mongo arrived he drove me to the hostel without any stops because I didn't need anything. I got a crash course on the gas heater and on the shower in his RV which he left available to me when he headed out for his friends birthday celebration. I watched Netflix for a bit more than an hour before indulging in the shower. Mister barked at me but let me in and proceeded to show me his toys one at a time. Cute! I showered and dressed and headed back to the hostel after giving a little praise to Mister. I watched the rest of my movie, ate the last half of the sandwich from yesterday and journaled. I was tired and planned to brush my teeth and make a potty run before sundown and crawl into bed. Tomorrow I'll take Mongo for breakfast and wait for my package. When I have that he'll drive me to route 615 and I can hike a nero day.

I'm so thankful to be inside and warm for these past 2 nights. It's been in the 20's. It all differs from my plan but I know God's hearing my prayers to keep me safe on trail and he brought me here. Ironically yesterday about 2 miles into my hike I saw where I'd planned to camp at the junction of the Big Boss trail. It was a nice site but fairly exposed. I think I'd have been cold there or likely not slept well. I woke up at 6:07 and stayed warm in my quilt until 6:50 when I got dressed and wandered to the privy. Then I sat by the electric heater waiting for Mongo so we could go to breakfast. He told me yesterday of a place down the street with a $4 breakfast and I told him I'd treat if he drove me. He's been fasting but that ended last night so he claimed an instant deal upon my suggestion. We also realized when he was showing me how to light the gas heater that both stayed at Stanimals in Glasgow on October 3rd. I thought when he first picked me up that he looked familiar but I disregarded it and so did he. He was doing a couple days of hiking then. Small world. My hike was short, just 4.4 miles. I climbed up less than 1,000' and then walked a Ridgeline before coming down to the shelter. Immediately I saw a 60's man sitting on the edge of the shelter and I introduced myself. He's Bird Nut and mentioned that he's glad to be there. He hiked from Chestnut Knob Shelter and he's doing a section but his feet are soft and he's not been on trail for a while. He's thru hiked the AT twice and section hiked it and also completed the pct. And yes, he's a bird watcher. Nice man. I mentioned my nice stay at Lickskillet hostel and texted Mongo to pick him up at route 615 in the morning since his phone didn't have a signal. Fancy pants and her husband arrived and also wanted to take advantage of Lickskillet hostel and Fancy pants needed to get to the Urgent Care for some help with her knee. I set up my tent for the first time this year and as I was doing so another section hiker arrived for dinner. He was a loud talker and he and Bird Nut kept in conversation while the man ate. When I was done getting myself set up I joined at the picnic table and made my dinner. The loud talker left and Fancy pants, her husband and I ate at the picnic table while Bird Nut ate dry food from a bag while sitting at the edge of the shelter. He set up inside but unfortunately the mosquitoes suddenly arrived and I was glad I'd be in my tent tonight! By 7pm I was ready for bed with my food bag hung. Bird Nut sleeps in the shelter with his making me feel even happier about sleeping in my tent.","Jenkins shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609168,"I got up at 11pm to pee and noticed Bird Nut had set up his tent behind the shelter  I bet the mosquitoes drove him to it. I got cold during the night and put my puffy, hat and buff on. It was supposed to be a low of 42° but I don't know what it really was. I slept pretty well otherwise, much better than I do in the shelter. I woke at 6 but stayed snuggled in until just after 7. I packed everything up, got my food bag and sat at the picnic table for breakfast. Fancy pants joined me there while her husband packed up their tent. Bird Nut said goodbye as he left around 8:30 and the rest of us were 10 minutes behind him. I headed south while they headed north. And my 3 miles of climbing began right away. My pack felt like someone had added stones to it! When I finally reached the top it was 5 miles of camel humps that were steep and rocky wearing me down and making me grumpy. I met Billy goat, uncle Gramps and Several section hikers. Later I met Co-op and his hiking friend just before Walker Gap where I planned to stop for lunch. It was just over 9 miles into my hike. I rested for 45 minutes and ate lunch before taking on a 1.4 mile climb up to Chestnut Knob Shelter, elevation 4409'. No wonder I'm tired! From here it was much easier going and I stopped for water at a pond 2 miles down trail. I filled up my water and called Appalachian Dreamer hostel about a room tomorrow. Mack answered and explained that he's closed because his wife is in liver failure. That is terrible news. I will pray for them both tonight. I looked for a suitable campsite near the pond but finding none I continued on 2 more miles to an unofficial campsite listed in Guthooks. I met Mouse and her friends who were not enjoying the climb up the mountain I was enjoying descending. They were heading to Chestnut Knob Shelter and I hope they get a nice sunrise in the morning. I found the campsite listed to be pretty nice and I set up and settled in. I walked down the trail a bit a found a suitable branch and hung my bear line before making my dinner. It was delicious, penne pasta and sauce from Good to Go, compliments of River. I added some bacon jerky on the side and a little stroop waffle for dessert. I washed up, hung my bag and dove into my tent leaving the swarm of mosquitoes and other flying pest outside. For good measure I killed the scary looking spider near my door so I wouldn't have to dream of him getting in. Sorry! But I really wanted to sleep. I'm writing this journal and I can hear lots of leaf rustling outside. I looked out in the direction of my food bag but it's too far away from my tent to see it. It sounds like it's coming from that direction. I hung it well and PCT style. We'll see if I can get some sleep now!","Jenkins shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609171,"Well despite the scuffle in the leaves and the fact that I had my little blaster ready.... nothing happened. I'm greatful! I fell asleep by 8:30 and woke just before 11 to pee.  The night was fairly warm and it was good for sleeping. I love being in my tent. I woke again at 3 to owls calling. All was silent except their banter back and forth. I loved it. It wasn't the barred owl call I'm used to so I couldn't picture what they look like but I loved listening to them as I drifted back to sleep. At 6:30 am the natural light woke me and by 7:15 I was up and packed. My food bag was undisturbed and thus I enjoyed a cinnamon peach oatmeal while perched on a rock. At about 8:15 I set off for the rest of the descent I was on which at the bottom would convert to a 900' climb. I wanted to get to the top for cell service so I could see if I had a place secured for tonight. I passed a few stray nobo hikers and when I reached the top and turned on my phone I had a voicemail from Bob at Bear Garden hostel confirming my stay. We texted back and forth regarding my desire to hike to route 610 and be picked up there rather than walk to the hostel. This would give me 2.7 more miles of hiking today for just under 10. Today and tomorrow are short 10ish mile days but that's okay. I'm trying not to sleep out wet in 25° temps but still keep moving forward. In addition to that there's the nerve in my right foot again and I don't want another shot in it so I'm trying to compromise. From my perch at the top of the climb I called Cynthia at the Long Neck Lair but her voicemail was full so I emailed her about staying there tomorrow night. At 4:22 on Saturday I still haven't heard back. I really don't want to stay at the Relax Inn but if I don't find another option I'll have to. I hiked the rest of my day, up to Knot Maul shelter and I noted the status of the water sources along the way for the nobo hikers. I stopped at the shelter and met 2 nobo thru hikers who were eating and didn't seem to want conversation. I ran out of water on the climb up so it meant a steep climb down a side trail for a liter. It's warm today and I was very thirsty and hungry. I finally reached route 610 at 2:07, early for my ride but I sat beside the road and snacked relaxing. Bob arrived a few minutes early and I hopped in the truck for a ride back to the hostel. I'm the only one here so far. I picked my bunk, popped a frozen pizza in the toaster oven and then washed it down with a root beer. A little frozen pizza can taste like gourmet cuisine out here. Bob came over with the Kubota 4x and drove me to their rental house down the street for a shower. He visited with the 86 year old woman across the street while I showered. Her sister used to own the house and she seems so sweet. We had a brief conversation across the road when I finished my shower and Bob dropped me back off at the bunkhouse. I'll visit the chapel here shortly. They're from Michigan, Bob and Berta and they retired here to build this hostel with a chapel so they could help hikers and serve God. Again, I'm feeling blessed. But for now I'm on the front deck of the bunkhouse drying my hair ( and my pee rag I washed in the shower) and drinking more electrolytes.","Mile 1626.2

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609465,"I slept really well, having the hostel all to myself, a full belly and a clean body. At some points the wind and rain woke me up but being safe, warm and dry I drifted right back to sleep. I had cereal and toast for breakfast which was included in my stay and texted Bob to let him know I need a fuel can if he's got one. He arrived to pick me up at the agreed time and had the fuel can and passport stamp with him. After we took care of business Bob drove me back to the trail. It was gently misting so I wore my rain jacket which also kept me warm. I didn't see a lot of hikers on the trail today and I assumed many might take the day off. It was windy with periods of mist, snow and freezing rain all day. From a mountain top I called Brian to discuss my accommodation for the night. I couldn't make myself stay at the Relax Inn and I'd just tried the Long Neck Lair again with no success. We agreed I'd get a room at the Comfort Inn and a shuttle. We hung up and I looked up the number for the comfort inn and was about to hit ""call"" when I saw an incoming call. I picked up and it was Cynthia at the Long Neck Lair confirming I had the room for the night and she'd pick me up at the Barn Restaurant. It was about 9:30 and I think I floated all the way to town. I ran into Mad Tree, Catmando and Lucky who ate at the Barn and said it was good. Finally at 1pm I arrived there and ordered my feast. A large cheeseburger, fries and hot fresh decaf coffee. I let Cynthia know that I was there. I finished my meal and added a large slice of chocolate I with cream cheese frosting. Nearly in a food coma and sporting a large food baby I waddled outside to meet Cynthia and her husband Ken. Super nice people. They drove me to their farm just up the street and made me very comfortable. They shared their living space with me in addition to providing a fabulous private room with bath. Cynthia even warmed up some homemade corn chowder for me and after dinner I helped feed the Alpaca. Beautiful babies! I loved learning about them and hugging one particularly friendly one. Cynthia then gave me a tour of the home her sister in-law is building next door.I spent the rest of my time in my room carving out a schedule for the next 16 days and booking hostels and hotels and shuttles while Cynthia did my laundry. Exhausted I finally gave in to slumber at 10pm.","Bear Garden hostel

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609466,"I might be April fool's day but no one has played a joke on me yet, nothing but human kindness all around. I had breakfast with Cynthia, a bowl of cereal, and she dropped me at the Exxon station on her way to work. I soon learned it was closed even though the opening hour is 7 a.m. and it's 7:30. I walked over to the Sunoco instead and carefully made a selection of a half dozen snacks and some spare batteries for my spot. I spoke with a lady there who asked me several questions about my journey and when I approached the register  a gentleman came in and asked if I was a thru hiker and when I answered yes he told the man who was cashing me out that he wanted to pay. His name is George and in true trail angel fashion he paid the $23 for my purchase. Very kind act indeed. As I  journied up the hill southbound across from the Sunoco and crossed the footbridge I had a tremendous view of the Long Neck lair and I stopped to take a few photos.They will be building at 10 room bunkhouse starting this May with the completion date of May 2020 so that they can continue to help hikers. I'm excited for them on their new venture. A few minutes after my view of their gorgeous farm I saw wild bunny rabbits in the underbrush off to the right and I stopped to watch them wiggle and nibble for a minute. It was 24° when Cynthia dropped me off this morning but the sky was clear and the sun shining illuminating the frost on the trail which glistened and was so beautiful. As the path wound around of the mountainside I continues to have views of the Long Neck lair off to the left and there's no question why they purchased this beautiful peace of property. At the time they weren't really aware of the trail and had no inclination to run a hostel, but they've develop the love for hikers and desire to help them. I'm looking forward to returning to this area with Brian in our camper and seeing their new endeavor open and operating.The climb warms me up before I reached the top I had already remove my hat and gloves and unzip my puffy. I knew right away with temps expected in the forties today and thesunshine it would be great hiking and I hope to make good time.Near the top of the climb after chatfield shelter I ran into a 2019 nobo named Raven. Raven and some other hikers stayed at partnership shelter last night and they were greeted with two trail angels bringing Burger King and beer. They feasted and were very delighted until later in the evening when a local drunk stopped in and they had to call the police. The police did come right away and address the situation seeming like it wasn't the first time, but it makes me super excited that I've chosen not to stay at that shelter tonight! Raven also told me Pork Chop was behind him and he wanted to scheme a little joke and so I played along. When I saw Pork Chop I pretended that I'd seen him on YouTube and that he was a sensation and asked for his autograph. He was on the phone with Applesauce and I said hi to him too. After a minute I let on that I was kidding and Raven put me up to it. Pork Chop is a nice guy and we had fun with it.  We chatted about my hike and my transportation dilemma and he took my number and said he'd ask Applesauce if he could help me out with the ride. Meanwhile I'll keep looking for someone to help. I met a female thru hiker named Straps, she's somewhere around my age and carrying the same pack I have. She had attempted a through hike and 2017 but is back out here in 2019 for a second try. She stayed at the Thomas knob shelter up in Grayson Highlands and told me that the horses are there at the shelter all night chewing on the dirt and licking rocks for salt and that when she went out to pee in the middle of the night the horses got really up close and personal because they wanted to lick her urine for the salt. Kind of gross, but a once in a lifetime experience just the same. She warned me to be sure and bring my trekking poles inside or they'd eat the cork and not expect much sleep if stay there. Not long after I left Straps I realized my bite valve was frozen and I had to play with it in my mouth a while before I could thaw it for water. I reached the Chatfield shelter just after 10 and I was feeling pretty good. I had stopped earlier at the Early Settlers Museum. Although the museum was closed for the winter they leave the old schoolhouse open for hikers. Inside I found a couple of pieces of trash so I took them. I'm really fond of preservation of this kind of history. It's humbling. And I was glad to visit and use the privy. Just before 2pm I reached 11+ miles and the Mt Roger's Recreation area headquarters. The visitor center was open and had heated restrooms! It might sound silly but it's such a treat. It's cold today. I looked around the book store, signed the logbook and spoke with the volunteer before sitting outside on the stones in the sunshine to have my lunch. I left at 2:30 and the first mile after was delightful! Nice rhododendron tunnels and easy trail. But I knew I had 3 miles uphill to my campsite. Thankfully it was gentle and I didn't mind it so much. With 2.5 miles to go I stopped at the last stream crossing of the day and in seconds added 2.2lbs to the load I was already carrying. I arrived at the campsite just as described in Guthooks and looked around. It's an okay site but there are more sites 2.3 miles ahead, should I press on? I could hike another 2 miles. I took my phone off and turned off the airplane mode to see if I had service. Bingo! I'm here for the night. Being able to text good night and good morning to Brian means a lot to me so I set up my site, hung my bear line, made Mexican quinoa for dinner (thanks River!) And eventually made my way into my tent with a full belly and clean teeth. I bundled up with all my clothes because it'll be around 29° tonight, perhaps colder up here on Brushy Mt.","Atkins VA 683, US 11, I-81

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609467,"While I laid in my tent last night listening to the cows down below and waiting for the sky to go dark I heard voices. A loud male voice and 2 softer voices. I listened for a minute thinking they had passed by but then I realized they were still there and I stuck my head out of my tent and told them there was plenty of room here if they wanted to camp. They needed water though, and that was 3 miles ahead. It was already 7:30 and I offered them a liter of mine but it wouldn't be enough and they hiked on. As soon as the sun disappeared the wind came out to play and that it did, all night. It reminded me of my sleepless night at Fullhardt shelter, whipping around leaves and twigs by my tent and making the trees creek and groan. And it was COLD. I was bundled up with my pajamas over my hiking clothes and my puffy, hat and buff on. My tent does a good job of sheltering me from wind but not cold. I slept in shifts of 2-3 hours at a time. I woke up at 3am shivering. I has to pee and as much as I hated to go outside and bare my ass I had too. The body uses it's energy to keep the pee warm and getting rid of that was key to getting warm again. I soon fell back asleep and woke again around 6 but stayed snuggled in dozing until almost 7:30. I did not want to get up but I had to. It was so difficult to break down camp with mittens on and too cold and windy not to wear them. So I alternated between mittens and no mittens so I could work more effectively. I left camp at 8:15 with no breakfast. I did brush my teeth because the thought of smelling my own breath while breathing thru my buff was too much and the buff was necessary. About 20 minutes into my hike I had to eat so I chose one of the frozen delectibles from my snack bag and slowly worked at it. It was a cliff bar and on the wrapping it says sustained energy. I could feel every granule of sugar between my teeth but it did sustain me for a while. When I reached the first shelter about 5 miles out I made myself a late oatmeal, nice and hot. It was worth the walk down to the shelter which I begrudgingly took. When I came back up to the trail I met Jack Daniels and his wife Moffet. They were super nice and I really hope I see these people and can give them trail magic in NH or VT. I met RD and his dad at a road crossing sharing the last can on trail magic coca cola and a few other hikers today. Flatlander and Magnolia with their very unfriendly dog Peaches. She was a nasty little thing! I met them just outside the trail to hurricane shelter and I was happy they were hiking on. I went up to the shelter and was delighted to see I had phone service but not happy with how cold it was and the fact that the wind was blowing right in. I called my son Kyle who had a work question and then I decided I'd have to move on to the tenting area nearby so I did that. I located a nice spot and just after I set up Buttercup arrived. It's nice to have some company. She set up and we ate dinner and hung our bags. By 7pm I was in my tent getting bundled up and journaling. I hope I'm warmer tonight. Tomorrow I'm sleeping inside. I've already booked a room and a shuttle. I can only take so much cold at a time. Even if I had a heavier quilt I'd feel the same way because so much time is spent setting up and breaking down camp. All the camp chores are done in the cold, even cooking and eating are in the cold.","VA 601 stealth site on Brushy mountain

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609642,"It was nice to know Buttercup was nearby last night. I woke up a few times chilled and in the morning my tent screen had ice on it from the condensation. My quilt was also damp. I packed up everything but my tent and walked up to the shelter where I made breakfast and used the privy. I was hoping my tent would dry out a bit by the time I returned but there was no such luck. I packed up my wet tent said goodbye to Buttercup who was just getting out of hers and began hiking up the hill toward Grayson Highlands Park. I saw several nobo hikers but none that stopped to talk. I stopped at Old Orchard shelter for a snack and water and when I opened the shelter log to write in it I happened to see Wildlife's entry back in November. I took a picture of it to post to Instagram and tag her. There was a lot of climbing today but I feel strong and I wasn't bothered as much by it until I got into the rocks, roots and mud. The elevation didn't bother me as much as that did. The old nerve in my right foot didn't like it at all and I could feel the cramping of my toes. I had told myself that I'd rest at the top of the climb but instead I stopped at the closest rock and climbed up on it to rest and enjoy some crackers with peanut butter. When I finished and hopped down resuming my hike the cramping was gone and didn't return for the rest of the day. I came to an open area with a gate and a hiker on the other side of the gate asked if I was Puddles. Rick has no trail name yet but he'd met River and has a picture of me so he recognized me. We talked for a few minutes before hiking away. Not long after I saw my first ponies! Milling and grazing about in the brush and not close to me but they were there. I hope to see more tomorrow. I arrived at the trail junction that would lead me to Massie Gap and called Dennis from the Grayson Highlands general store and Inn to let him know that I'd be in the Gap shortly for pickup. I hiked down the .6 mile side trail and waited in the parking area for him while observing some commotion with law enforcement pick up trucks. I was early and the weather was warm and sunny. I really need a short sleeve shirt and I don't have one with me.Dennis arrived and drove me to the Inn but along the way he stopped to talk to one of the law enforcement trucks who was approaching from the other direction. The commotion was about a hiker who fell on trail and broke his arm. He was hiking north and was near a shelter 3+ miles from the gap and hiking to the Gap so Dennis could get him to the hospital. The law enforcement officer was inclined to hike in because it was taking a long time to get the hiker out. At the Inn Dennis got me settled in and Phyllis made me an awesome Burger and fries which I washed down with a yuengling lager. Then I retreated to my room, showered and put on my finest laundry attire, my rain gear, before getting my laundry done and spreading my tent out in the sunny back yard to dry. Reality has started to hit me. I've hiked 2,000 miles. WOW! I worked on reserving a bed at Crazy Larry's Hostel in Damascus and he said he'd have a bucket of pig brains waiting on me for dinner. He's a hoot! Can't wait to meet him. I watched an episode of Dateline before turning off the TV.","Hurricane Mt shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609674,"I felt really good this morning. I'm excited about the fact that I have only 12 hiking days left. WOW! To actually be able to say that hasn't really fully connected with me yet but the more I say it the more real it feels. I took a quick warm shower and packed up my bag heading downstairs for breakfast. I talked to a couple with a 9 year old boy while Dennis made me an omelette with spinach from his greenhouse on site and toast. The boy, Mason gave me trail magic. A small bag with bite size candy bars. It was very touching and he hoped to see other thru hikers to give trail magic to on his hike up to Mt Rogers. When Dennis drove me back to Massie Gap he told me the hiker with the broken arm made it down to the Gap at 7pm last night and he got him to the hospital. He fell while hiking and passing a camera to another hiker. Glad he'll be okay. The Grayson Highlands is much rockier than I thought but I rather liked the rocky climbs. In some way I found them easier and I just kept going at a steady pace through miles of the rocky climbing. At one point it popped into my head that I felt like Forrest Gump. Heck, I even had an assortment of chocolate in my skirt pocket!I stopped at a bench where I saw 2 ponies and had a nice conversation with a young white and fawn colored male. He listened well but didn't say anything and the pony with him I believed to be his mother. He posed for photos and I wanted to pet him but I was afraid to so I said goodbye and hiked in thru the gate.I caught up to Mason and his parents and thanked Mason again for the trail magic. We chatted and I learned they're from the same area of Michigan River is from. It was really warm and sunny and Mason was getting an application of sunblock. I'm already sunburned but they offered me some and I gladly accepted it and smeared my face and hands with it, the only parts of me that see the sun right now. Later up the trail I stopped at the Thomas Knob shelter to sign the log and there was a group of youngsters there with 2 chaperones. I signed the log and pressed on without spending any time there. I ran into several nobo hikers but most hiked on by. Cedar did stop to talk and she told me about the Virginia Creeper Trail and how it will get me into Damascus 4 miles sooner. Hmmm. I had planned my lunch at Buzzard Rock and I was ahead of schedule so when I had service I let my shuttle driver Gungho know I'd be earlier if he was available. As I approached buzzard rock I realized it was far too windy to eat there. It would scatter my potato sticks and turn my pepperoni slices into mini frisbees! I had to hike further down off this ridge and away from that rock! I finally found a spot and enjoyed my lunch without the deafening wind. When I got to route 58 I was thirsty and out off water so I grabbed a liter from the stream there, treated it and sat down. I'm a half hour earlier than even my latest calculations thanks to my Forrest Gump legs! But just as I sat down Gungho arrived taking a chance I'd be earlier. I hopped in his 4runner with my bottle of water and still 15 minutes before it was safe to drink. Damn! But as we drove down the winding mountain road a bottle at my feet was slamming around. I reached down to find a bottle of propel. Immediately he said ""oh you can have that if you'd like, sorry it's not cold"" and before he was done speaking I was chugging. Once again the trail providing. I settled up with him and worked out a price for a Sunday shuttle to Sam's Gap and got checked in with Crazy Larry who had made chicken noodle soup instead of the bucket of pig brains he'd promised. Good thing! I was the only one there with a room to myself. I went to Mojo's and had a huge salad, chocolate pie ( because that's what my friend Jeanne chose after I sent her a picture of the dessert case) and a Green Man Porter. Then I went back to the hostel where Larry and some other hostel owners were enjoying a little pot luck dinner. I showered and journaled and talked to Brian before closing my eyes.

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609755,"I didn't have a great night of sleep. It was just me and Crazy Larry at the hostel and I was cold at first and then woke up sweaty. I  took advantage of the lock on my door and stripped off my pajamas and crawled back into bed with just the sheet and my last 15mg of melatonin. I woke up with my alarm at 6am feeling better but hearing the pouring rain outside. Larry made me breakfast that consisted of home fries (made with sweet potato, white potato, onion and seasoning) eggs, sausage, biscuits, cantalope, orange juice and coffee. He was off to take a nap because he didn't sleep well last night either. I would rather take a nap than hike in the cold rain but it wasn't an option for me. I need to keep this schedule. My shuttle driver (also Larry) was a few minutes early but I was ready and off we went. He was a great driver on these winding mountain roads dropping me at route 58 where I left off yesterday. I hiked myself warm and despite being soaked I was never cold. By 10:30 the rain had stopped and by 11am it was sunny. I kept my rain gear on a while until it was mostly dry and then stopped and packed it in my bag. I even took off the long sleeve shirt I had and left my short sleeve shirt on. It felt good to have my arms uncovered. I waited until I was at the bottom of the last climb of the day for my lunch break. I saw a little path thru the rhododendron that I thought must least to a campsite and took it. Sure enough it opened up to a beautiful large campsite with great rocks for sitting and there on the other side of the 50' wide site were 2 more trails leading to the Virginia Creeper Trail which I could clearly see. I've been seeing it off and on all day, running alongside the AT at lower elevation and disappearing when the AT climbs high. I wondered why the trails didn't combine here, it seems silly they don't. I'd hiked myself dry with the exception of my feet which were soggy and most disgruntled. Sitting felt good but I didn't take my shoes off. While I lunched on pepperoni and cheddar ruffles chips I looked longingly at the creeper trail. It's 4 miles shorter, the words of Cedar ringing in my head. My feet hurt so badly. Would it be so bad if I took the creeper? I mean seriously what's 4 miles out of 2190.9? For 20 minutes I considered the option and thought about how I'd feel later if I did that. I pondered other things too, like the bag of artificially flavored fruit slices I was eating, do all the bags have 4 orange, 3 red, 2 green and 1 yellow ""fruit slices""?  I took the climb of 2+ miles on the white blaze trail. I don't feel badly about considering the option of the creeper but I do feel really good about my choice to stay on trail, despite the protesting of my feet. But I did tell myself that someday I WILL do the Virginia Creeper Trail and I'll do it with Brian on bicycles no matter how much he complains that the seat hurts his butt. He'll have to get some tips from our friend Kim F on that. After all this trail hurts my feet and yet I hike it every day! What's 33 miles with a sore ass?Not quite to the top of the climb I scared 2 large birds not far apart. The first was a pilliated woodpecker and the other I believe was a grouse. They scared me too! The trail brought me down across route 58 and for 4/10ths of a mile is joined with the Virginia Creeper Trail as it comes into town. I was back at the hostel and freed my feet from the painful enslavement of wet socks and shoes putting the stinky sheddings outside to dry in the sun. Then I walked to the post office in my Crocs to grab a box while Larry warmed up some of his homemade chicken noodle soup for me. I sat at his table and ate it right out of the pan. Delicious! There were 3 new hikers at the hostel so the shower was busy and as soon as it was my turn I took advantage of it. I met my new roommate from Finland, Finish Line. She's staying 2 nights and taking a zero tomorrow, as is the hiker from Germany. All nice people and certainly quiet. When I was hungry again I wandered over to 7 Trails where I received the worst service ever. The naked wings and beer were good however. At the end of it all the owner comped my dinner and I brought my Cesar salad back to the hostel and gave it to one of the guys who was most appreciative. At 8:30 I crawled into bed exhausted. Finish Line was still out and I barely heard her come in later. My alarm was set for 6:30 and my shuttle comes at 8am again, right after breakfast.","Route 58

We all sat at the table together and enjoyed chocolate chip pancakes, eggs, sausage, fruit, juice, milk and coffee. Finish Line and Ghost we're taking a zero so I was the only one hiking today. Larry the shuttle driver picked me up at 8am and I was hiking north from Low Gap into Damascus by 8:30. It was sunny and cool but not cold and I hiked in my skirt without leggings and a short sleeve shirt. I'm loving this weather! Before I left the hostel Ghost commented on the size of my calves. I feel a little like that bicycle rider in the insurance commercial who customized his calves. In all honesty they're quite large and muscular now and I won't be wearing any knee high boots anytime soon because I'm sure I couldn't zip them. I hadn't used my spot for 2 days but I changed the batteries this morning and turned it on. I get upset with myself when I forget to turn it on at the start of my hike, as I did again today. Much of today was a ridge walk with camel humps and views of Shady Valley. I passed by a rickety old log constructed shelter no longer maintained for use and found it to be a perfect place to pee. It was actually a creepy looking structure listing to one side and I couldn't imagine any emergency in which I'd enter it to stay in but it made a good picture. A way later I crossed the TN/VA border and sent the last Marco Polo of a  state line to Brian. It was emotional for me. About a half mile later I stopped on a log to rest and snack when 2 trail runners stopped to tend to a hit spot. They were hoping to do 30 miles today in preparation for a trail run in May. I looked at them and their condition and totally thought I hope they have a bailout plan. The bird chatter today was the most I've heard so far and it's such a happy sound to me. As I started the descent into town I saw a group camped on the left and guessed they were boyscouts. They in fact were and I shared with them the birth of my hike being when I was getting my own son ready for his first overnight with scouts. It was a feel good day. I walked down between 2 homes and into town. It was emotional coming into town and seeing the arch knowing that I have finished VA. The park was filled with families playing and spending time together picnicing, playing ball, etc and it was good to see. It was 2:30 and I stopped at the diner for a burger and fries and it hit the spot! I stopped at the dollar general for melatonin and Advil before heading to Larry's. I showered and changed and went to the grocery store with Larry and Larry the shuttle driver where I picked up some raspberries and a protein shake and some pastry to share at the hostel. I met Mr Perfect who is deaf and checked in today, happy to have a pastry. When my hunger returned I went to Mojo's for salad and fried green tomatoes which were excellent and then I put my satisfied belly to bed. I have tomorrow off!","Low Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609959,"I was so hot in the night I slipped out of my pajamas and just kept the covers on me. Before Finish Line woke up I had slipped back into them. Again I could smell something brewing in the kitchen and knew Larry was busy cooking for his house guests. I joined the other hikers and Larry's friend Willy at the table for biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, juice, milk and sliced tomatoes. Once again Larry made us all happy. I changed the bed linens and packed myself up, vacated the room and waited outside with Sally the hostel dog for Gungho to arrive. He's the shuttle driver who is delivering me to nature's Inn hostel where I'll be hiking out of for Sam's Gap to Allen Gap. Gungho arrived at 10:45 and by just after noon I was checking in at Nature's Inn. I met Taft and although I originally reserved a cabin I upgraded to a room in a 3 bedroom home on site. The cabins don't have plumbing and for an extra $10 I would avoid having to walk to the bathhouse in the middle of the night in the rain. As it turned out I had the house to myself. I bought food for lunch and dinner from the on-site resupply store and felt at home. It poured off and on all afternoon and evening. The weather forecast for tomorrow is severe weather with thunderstorms, wind and heavy rain at times. I'm concerned about making it over Big Butt and into Jerry Cabin shelter before the weather arrives after 1pm. I talked to Brian's Aunt Patti and then Brian before  watching the ACM awards on TV. I tucked myself in at 10pm. The shuttle leaves at 8am. I hope I can sleep well with this weather weighing on me.","Damascus VA

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610096,"I was super restless last night and after taking melatonin I didn't get to fall asleep until almost midnight. I woke up at 3 and went back to sleep until 5:30. At 6:30 I got up and showered and packed up my bag and by 7:30 I was down at the main building called the barn. Taft and his wife Sarah were there. I was the only one hiking out today and they were very concerned about the weather and couldn't in good conscience drop me off at Sam's Gap without talking about it. Ultimately I decided to change my plan and hike 8.7 miles from Sam's Gap to Devil's fork Gap today slackpacking. When I get back we'll work on the plan to slackpack 21+ miles tomorrow. I went back to the house and emptied my backpack of the things I don't need for a day hike, grabbed a muffin and left in the shuttle, the only lonely hiker. At Sam's Gap a sign on the trail pointed up the hill to a pickup truck and a man named Quiet Paul. He was set up to cook scrambled eggs and hash browns. It was a great way to start my hike and I welcomed the protein. After my meal I walked down the hill and onto the trail. Within a minute I was standing at a granite monument placed by the Moye family when they transferred this particular property to become part of the Appalachian Trail. It was moving. I read it and cried actually because it was based on their faith in God and I needed to be reminded that God is with me and still guiding my journey, keeping me safe. So as dissapointing as it was to decide to hike a short day today and a really long one tomorrow, I felt at the moment assured this was God's plan for me. I took a photo so I could look up the scriptures later at the hostel. The hike was lovely actually with happy birds and a carpet of fragrant white flowers on the forest floor. I made a video and shared it with Brian on Marco Polo because it just needed to be shared. Several nobo hikers passed by me and honestly if I hear one more of them say I'm hiking in the wrong direction I'm going to get snippy. I'm tired of hearing that. I did tell some of them that there was breakfast at the Gap, but I neglected to share it with the sarcastic ones. I took my time to enjoy the birds, observing a little Finch on a branch above my head and some juncos on the ground. I noticed the wind  picking up and the clouds filling in and at 10:45 it started sprinkling. I didn't bother to put on rain gear. At noon I called Taft and told him I'd be at Devil's fork at 12:30 and he asked me to call back when I got there. So at 12:25 I arrived at the Gap and called. My phone pinged and I looked to see a message from my niece in TN. She and my nephew are going to have dinner with me on the 17th in Gatlinburg. I haven't seen them but 2 or 3 times in their lives and not since they were in grade school. In the rain under a pine tree and next to the TN state line sign I let my emotions go. No one would know that my wet cheeks weren't the results of the rain. I can't wait to see them and I feel like I just received all the push I need to get to Fontana Dam on the 16th. The rain stopped suddenly and the sun shown through the clouds. I crossed the street from under my protective tree and waited in the sunshine. I had waited 45 minutes in the intensified rain with thunder in the distance before calling Taft again. His wife was on her way but she'd almost wrecked her car and was shaken. My focus shifted from myself to my shuttle driver. In 20 minutes she arrived and we took a moment for her to relax before heading to the hostel. When I got there I realized she'd been busy all afternoon getting hikers off trail because of the weather. I helped her out by doing some of the laundry at the house. I had a can of soup for lunch and relaxed before making arrangements for tomorrow. The Hemlock Hollow Inn hostel at Allen Gap is where I'll be tomorrow night. Diane's son James is going to drop packs off at Nature's Inn tonight that belong to Alice and Mike who are my new housemates and he'll pick up my gear. Tomorrow I'll get dropped at Devil's fork and James will pick me up at Allen Gap when I'm done. I called the shuttle driver John and laughing heart hostel and let them know my change of plans. John will get me Wed morning and bring me to Garenflo Gap. Just 8 more hiking days! After dinner I tried out the massage chair at the house but I'm not sure I'm a fan. It's a bit intense! I'll stick with my massage therapist Laura at home.","Sam's Gap NC

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610101,"Unfortunately it was raining cats and dogs when I woke up this morning, and I was not thrilled to be second guessing my decision. I did have a good night of rest though. I went down to the main building after getting ready and all packed up and when Sarah and Taft arrived they made fried Chicken with gravy and biscuits so I indulged before hopping into the shuttle with Sarah and three other hikers. Sarah dropped us off at Devil's fork Gap and I headed south while the others headed north after giving Sarah a big hug and thanking her for the hospitality. It was still raining and I was covered in my rain gear and wearing my waterproof socks for the first time. With 21 + miles I know what happens to my feet when they're wet and I couldn't bear the thought of 21 painful miles so I was excited about my socks and the opportunity to retain dry feet. About two hours into the hike the rain stopped and my feet were still perfectly dry and comfortable inside my waterproof socks despite the fact that my boots were soaked. I hiked for a while longer in my rain gear but opened up my jacket to let some of my heat out. When I stopped for a short break on the trail I just wrestled out of my raincoat but left it tucked between me and my pack in case the rain should reappear. I stopped for lunch at a shelter and took a 20-minute break. While I was there two northbound hikers stopped and took off their shoes and socks and were commenting about their painful wet feet hoping to dry out a little bit before proceeding. I saw at least three dozen hikers today, and probably 20 of them I saw first thing this morning in the rain headed down towards the gap. I also noticed a couple of tents set up at different campsites looking like hikers were just taking it a zero or waiting until the rain to subside before going out to hike. I have never taken a zero in my tent or a shelter in the woods, I imagine it would be incredibly boring! I had fully intended to take the bypass for both big butt and firescald mountains today because of the weather but as I approached big butt Mountain I noticed that the bypass Trail was really close to the summit and I couldn't imagine that it would have made much of a difference if any so I stayed on the Appalachian Trail and went over the summit of big butt which was Rocky but fun. later when I came to firescald Mountain I totally stopped and read the sign about the bypass and took a left to their thinking that I was taking the bypass. A little while later, maybe two tenths of a mile in I noticed that it seemed to be pretty well trodden for a bypass and then I happened to notice the white blaze and not a blue. I realized then that although my intention was to take the bypass I was in fact still on the Appalachian Trail. I just can't deviate! It made me nervous because when I looked to my East I saw blue sky and white puffy clouds but up at the summit when I looked to the West I saw a really dark clouds coming my way. Although it did not rain on me as I suspected it might and the rumbling that I heard was actually an airplane and not Thunder I was quite nervous and the cloud did blow over covering my path in fog but also cooling me down with cooler air and condensation. Nonetheless I was happy to get to the other side of that Rocky exposed summit and back below Tree Line. The rest of the day became sunny and warm and I actually enjoyed most of my hike all the way down to Allen Gap. I met radio, out doing a short hike with his dog Phoenix and he offered to slack pack me from Allen Gap into hot springs, but unfortunately I have already hiked those miles and I'm not looking to repeat them. It was really kind of him and I enjoyed our conversation. I also came across to 2018 thru hikers finishing up named hippie and drop bear. once again it was nice to see that I wasn't the only left over.when I arrived at Allen Gap I was about 40 minutes earlier than I had arranged with James but there was no cell service for me to let him know so I sat on the stone platform for the forestry sign took off my extremely muddy boots and put on my Crocs and waited. James arrived about 10 minutes early and drove me the two miles to the hostel where I met his mom Diane, got checked in and enjoyed sitting on the porch overlooking the creek for a few minutes. I popped two frozen sandwiches into the microwave and had a banana and a Gatorade before retiring to my cabin and getting a shower at the bathhouse. It was close to 9 when I laid down but my feet were still twitching from being pounded for 21 miles. I took some Advil and some magnesium as well as melatonin. I was alone in the cabin and with no television or other distraction and no wi-fi. I tried very hard to go to sleep but it was probably 11 before my restless legs and feet would allow my slumber. Tomorrow Diane will meet me at the main building at 7am so I can have breakfast before Mountain John arrives to shuttle me to Garenflo Gap.","Devil's fork Gap

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610391,"I had a difficult time with sleep last night. I woke up at 3 but I had been hot while sleeping so I had taken off my clothes and was just under the sheet. I needed to go pee but I didn't want to get dressed and get all woken up and go out to the bathhouse in order to do that so I just dozed in and out of sleep until a little after 5. I finally got up not able to hold it anymore or be comfortable and I went out to the bathhouse after getting dressed and got myself ready for the day. When I came back to the cabin it was 5 after 6 and I decided to lay back down on my bunk until 6:45 when I would get up pack my bag and wander over to the main building to meet Diane. But I fell asleep and when I awoke it was 5 after 7. I scrambled and threw everything in my bag and as I was walking over to the main building at 10 past 7 Diane was walking toward me to see if I had overslept. I grabbed a sandwich and a banana and an orange juice and settled up with Diane and James and my shuttle driver Mountain John arrived a few minutes early. It took a little over an hour to drive from Allen Gap to Max Patch Road. originally I was going to go to garenflo Gap and hike South to Max Patch Road and have John pick me up there but it was better for his schedule to bring me to Max Patch Road in the morning and he discounted the fair for me. On the drive up we saw a black bear. Oh my. In the end it turned out to be a much better direction to hike because there was less elevation gain hiking North then there would have been hiking South. I hiked over Max Patch and stopped to enjoy the beautiful views and the clouds in the valley below. I saw a man camped on the top and a few people camped inside the woods. In my haste this morning I totally failed to prepare myself for today's hike. While I had a bottle of Gatorade that I purchased last night at the store, I only had three snacks in my pouch, a package of crackers, a small bag of peanut M&Ms, and a bag of swedish fish. I had nothing for lunch.I did not have my food bag with me or my tent or sleeping gear because John had dropped all of that stuff off at laughing heart hostel for me where I'd be staying this evening. I drank the Gatorade and ate the M&M's around 10:30 and stopped at a stream and scooped up a liter of water in my nalgene bottle. I continued on a small Ascent with a nice gentle slope and I could smell a campfire. I thought to myself what kind of crazy person would be taking a zero day in the woods and having a campfire on such a gorgeous day? But as I approached my 7 Mile Mark at lemon Gap I soon realized that the campfire was coming from a group of people who were sitting around a pickup truck and a bunch of tables and chairs. It was Trail magic! A Bible study group was out with a full array of food and drink for the hikers, cooking up hot dogs and offering fresh fruit, cookies, sweet tea potato chips and more. Once again I feel like God is watching over me and today he provided me the lunch that I failed to prepare for myself. Trail magic still makes me emotional, and I was telling this to the lady who cooked my hot dogs and she said that she completely understood. 
It was an amazing hike today. After lunch I had an ascent and descent before climbing Big Bluff Mt and my final descent to Garenflo Gap. I arrived a half hour earlier than I told John despite my relaxing at lemon Gap with the trail magic. But I had texted John at 2 to let him know and we arrived at the Gap at exactly the same time. I met his girlfriend Rose and together they dropped me at the hostel and introduced me to the caretaker Tigger who had been keeping my gear safe in her private quarters until my arrival. She showed me to the bunk room but I immediately realized I wouldn't be able to sleep there, so I upgraded to a private room with a twin bed and it is absolutely perfect. I settled in got a shower and did my laundry before heading into town and having a nice steak dinner at the iron Horse station. the live music the food and the beer were all fantastic and it really made me long to have my husband sharing the experience with me. Hot springs is such a great community and I really have enjoyed both of my visits here. after dinner I wandered over to the dollar store to grab a small container of sunblock because I've noticed that I'm getting sun burns on my arms now as well as my face. Not need the whole 3 oz container so I'll squeeze some into one of my empty pill bags and carry that with me to use over the next few days. it's really sinking in now that I have just six hiking days left but I still have anxiety over the Smokey's. Tomorrow I'll want to make it from Max Patch Road to the Davenport shelter which will be a seventeen-mile day with my full pack. So I called and talked with Brian and updated my journal before getting ready for bed at 9. John will pick me up at 8 tomorrow morning and I'm hoping that I can grab some eggs at the diner beforehand.","Max patch Rd

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610392,"I slept really well last night and I'm happy about that! I set my alarm for 6 but woke up just before and turned it off. I got dressed and packed up and ready to go before walking down the street to the Smokey Mountain Diner for breakfast. The biscuit was amazing and I slathered it in real butter. It came with an omelette. That's sarcasm. I boogied back to laughing heart hostel to meet my shuttle driver for 8 and had almost a half hour to spare. I spent it in my room talking to God and thinking about what the next 6 days may bring. 
John arrived about 15 minutes late and had me at the trailhead at 9am. I had 17 miles to hike and my goal is to get to Davenport Gap shelter. The climb up to snowbird mountain felt intense. Half way up I stopped at a log for lunch and 3 other sobo hikers passed me and stopped ahead for their lunch. I took 20 minutes and after I passed them I never saw them again. I counted hikers today but lost track after 50. When I arrived at the top of snowbird I was disappointed by the lack of view and a funky space age looking communication building. Totally weird! After that summit it was down hill for a long time and it hurt my feet. My right foot is being a bugger and I'm trying to cope with it for the rest of my hike. I finally stopped at a road crossing by a creek (where Standing Bear Hostel is) and took a half hour with my shoes and socks off. Many hikers passed by me and then one girl stopped and told me about trail magic a mile away. I put my shoes and socks back on and boogied down the trail. When I came down the stone steps into the parking lot I wet my bandana in a little stream and threw it around my neck to cool off. It was 75° and sunny today and the canopy isn't leafed out yet and I did slather on 50spf sunblock this morning. But man I'm sweating! It's dang hot! I met Flicker and Gandalf in the parking lot, 2017 hikers with hot dogs, cold soda, Gatorade and little snack bags to go with goodies. Since I'd just eaten a protein cookie at my log perch a mile away I only had room for 1 hot dog and a Coke. Plus I still had a 2.5 mile climb to the shelter. I passed up the goodie bag because I didn't want the extra weight. I crossed Davenport Gap and put my Backcountry permit in the self service box as I entered the Smokey's. WOW! That sounds so cool! I lumbered up the last mile and arrived at an almost full shelter but fortunately there was 1 space left on the main level. I grabbed it and soon realized one of my buddies is a really too chatty older man. I ate a couple of snacks, washed up and hung my pack and food bag in the shelter. This shelter is enclosed by a chain link fence across the front to keep bears out. It's the last one of it's kind in the Smokey's. It also doesn't have a privy, so when you feel the urge you have to walk up the hill to the""field of dreams"" and pick out your spot. A cat hole is leave no trace practice, however some hikers are unfortunately uneducated or just don't care. It's really disgusting. I hope I can hold my business for the first 7 miles tomorrow or find a private and less used space before then!","Max Patch Road

I slept pretty well despite the interruptions of late arriving hikers, up until 9:30 and under headlamp. But there was no room at the Inn. We were side by side with 2 on the dirt floor. I woke up at 6:15 and was hiking out at 7:19 without breakfast. I knew I had a lot of climbing today and it was the day I was most concerned about. I popped 3 Advil and washed them down with a half bottle of electrolytes, almost like a hangover cure for thru hiking. The trail climbed up to the junction of Mt Cammerer trail and it was here I took my break to cook oatmeal. I'd eaten a kind bar about 3 miles ago and I was some kind of hungry! I opted not to take the 0.6 mile trip to the fire tower despite the reports on amazing views. I can't fathom adding 1.2 to my already taxing day. The hikers headed down to Davenport Gap were 50/50 on the side trip. I met Lolli and Pop and several other hikers while I enjoyed my oatmeal. It was sprinkling since I'd left the shelter but not enough to make me put on rain gear. The wind however chilled me and so I wore my rain jacket for warmth while I ate. My next stop was Cosby knob shelter about 3 miles further up the trail and there I ate summer sausage and Pringles and got more water. I met a Forest Ranger here also and he was just arriving for the night. He spoke with everyone there but didn't ask for my permit. I wasn't going to stop here because I was told that in 2000 a woman in her 50's was mauled to death by a bear. But the trail today was tough and I needed to rest and eat. I'm thankful for the overcast cooler weather and even the light rain. After lunch I climbed more and I stopped to eat some sweedish fish on the trail. I can't eat those and hike up hill because I'll choke. So standing there eating for the sugar I was bored and I read the ingredients. To be fair these are a knock off brand, the 2 bags for a buck at the gas station. And fittingly so, because the ingredients included carnuba wax, which by the way adds trace amounts of fat. Really? So should I feel badly about adding fat to my car or car wax to my body because I'm pretty sure I wax my car with carnuba wax! It probably wasn't my best choice in food for the day. These climbs today are almost continuous and of my 15 miles I bet 12 were uphill. In addition there are hundreds of log water bars. Ugh! They're a big step up and so annoying. I'm reminded of my first few days of trail when Brian was hiking with me and how much we hated the darn water bars then, having to boost yourself up them every time. Finally they ended and I gave myself small sections to accomplish being 2-3 miles each and stopped for a short rest at each one. Finally I reached a beautiful mossy pine forest, it was just gorgeous! I lingered and took a video as the trail softened up and the elevation lessened. I was about 1.5 miles away from tri corner knob shelter and I had cell service so I emailed my trail angel Christine with my pick up time for tomorrow at Newfound Gap. Finally I arrived just before 4pm. I had met many hikers today, Jingles, Nav, Puck Carrier, Ninja, Puppet, Pizza Steve, Whitey and many others who's names I forget or didn't get. 
I picked a spot on the lower level of the shelter and there's not enough room to sit up, it's awkward but I can see where the roof leaks and I don't want to get wet if it rains. I got water and made macaroni and cheese for dinner and a nice hot coffee. I cleaned up after and another hiker showed me how to use the bear cables. At 6 I crawled into bed to journal and hopefully get a great night of sleep. Tomorrow is 15+ to newfound gap but the elevation looks much friendlier!","Davenport Gap shelter

After trying to fall back asleep I finally struggled out from my sleeping area without kicking anyone in the face and went around the corner of the shelter to pee. I noticed that the Hiker to my left was closer to me than he was at 6pm and thought he might have been trying to stay away from the cold stone wall he was up against. It didn't matter because I still had plenty of room. I woke up at 6am under full dark and as quietly as possible packed up my bedding and took it outside along with my pack. I was at the picnic table with 2 other hikers treating my fresh liter of water and packing up when 3 trail runners came into camp by headlamp. One was wearing a rain poncho and all were wearing some kind of neoprene vest that carried their water and necessities. They looked like storm troopers to me and the 3 of us just watched as they filtered water and squeezed tubes of goo into their mouths before running off again. It was a strange few minutes. When I left camp at 7:35 after oatmeal and coffee it was under clouds and drizzle. I didn't bother with rain gear. The forest was dark and moss covered, beautiful but creepy at the same time. I hiked until 10 and took a quick snack break standing on trail. The path was up and down but nothing heavy and I put the miles behind me fairly quickly. I needed to go to the bathroom but for miles I was on a ledge with a steep drop off on either side. Finally just before Charlie's bunion I took a side Trail a couple of hundred feet and found a good spot. Apparently it was a popular one as there was lots of toilet paper already there, disappointing. At the next shelter I stopped for lunch and saw Pop Tart there drinking a 1lb beer and talking to another hiker. I'd met him in VA. I ate my lunch and left within 20 minutes. I was only 3 miles from Newfound Gap and I'd be there early but I didn't mind waiting. As I hiked thru hoards of day hikers heading to Charlie's Bunion I saw Christine my trail angel hiking towards me. I was completely surprised to see her on trail but so happy. We hiked out together and enjoyed some conversation. I'm so happy to have her helping me right now and to know she'll be with me at the finish. She stopped McDonald's for me on the way to her house and along the way we saw elk on the side of the road and stopped for pictures. It was very cool! I got settled in at her house, showered and did laundry before she drove me to Ingles for a resupply. My cousin Mike arrived around 8pm and Christine made a fabulous dinner of tilapia, sweet potato and salad. We shared some wine with dinner and then it was off to bed. I called Brian to say goodnight before updating my journal. I'm looking forward to tomorrow and Clingman's Dome.

Michael was sitting at the counter fueling himself with caffeine and talking to Christine while she cooked up bacon, potatoes and eggs for us accompanied by toast and fresh fruit. She's so very kind, thoughtful and generous. We left a little after 7 headed to Newfound Gap and arrived around 8. The weather was chilly and windy with off and on rain. We hugged Christine goodbye and set off across the street and down the trail. Before long the rain became steady and the wind continued blowing as we passed many hikers heading to the nearest shelter. We climbed up to Clingman's Dome and while it was shrouded in clouds we still climbed up on the observation tower for a selfie, the wind blowing us sideways and almost costing Michael his hat on the way. After we left the dome and continued south we were hoping to garner some protection from the wind and rain by the forest itself and our expected orientation with the ridge but we were disapointed. The wind direction from the East and our walk along the ridge never allowed us cover. We were soaked and the trail was full of water and mud, just as our boots now were. My waterproof socks were an epic fail and I felt like my feet were wearing small aquariums. 
We stopped at double spring Gap shelter briefly. It was nearly ful of hikers who'd been there most of the day huddled in their sleeping bags staying warm with the tarp across the entry flapping loudly in the wind.  We pushed on the 1.7 miles to Silers Bald shelter where we planned to stay. We arrived soaked to the bone and chilly to find the only space the hikers would make available to Michael who had a reservation was under the leaking roof. Charming. I put my tyvex down on the dirt floor and made my bed in front of the torn and flapping tarp that Michael tied his shoes to in order to try to hold it a bit by wedging them between a rock and the stone shelter wall. It wouldn't hold up against the powerful determined wind. We cooked and ate in the shelter with the other hikers even though it is not advised but there was no way to cook or eat outside. Late arrivals wandered in and some chose to hike on to Spring Gap shelter while one party tented and another man took the floor space by me. Michael hung my skirt back up outside after it blew off once landing in a puddle and we thought the wind might dry it overnight since the rain was intermittent now. With our dry clothes and puffy jackets on we got warm in our beds and finally with the howling wind and intermittent rain we fell asleep to the flapping tarp and wind. I wondered if Michael had regret already but I didn't ask. He soldiered through the 12.5 miles today never once complaining. I'm happy he's here with me because I'm less miserable with his company.","Newfound Gap

My internal alarm clock woke me at 6 and I went out to pee. I was shocked when I pulled back the corner of the tarp and saw everything frozen. On the way back in I looked at my skirt and socks that were hanging out to dry and found them frozen solid. Absolutely stand on their own solid. There was no was that skirt was going to sit on my hips and it I had to guess at the temperature I'd say 28° with a stiff unrelenting wind now from the East. Fabulous. This should be fun. In all seriousness I whispered to Michael that we'd wait for daylight to get up and I laid back in my bed on the floor to think about our safety and the situation. I don't want to die out here and certainly don't want to risk someone else by making a poor decision. It wasn't raining but it was very windy and below freezing. I remembered Michael said the forecast was for it to clear during the day. With the impression that we'd have no more precipitation I decided I'd hike in my dry sleeping clothes and I discussed this with Michael when we got up. We were in agreement. Hiking in wet clothes, even if I could thaw my skirt out would be a potential death sentence the hypothermia way. I took our food bags off the cables which took extra effort because of the buildup of rime ice on the cables. After breakfast in the shelter and Michael fetching water for us both we were packed and hiking out around 8:30 or so. The wind was blowing but the rime ice was beautiful and we both chose to see the beauty despite the difficulty of being cold. Our boots were frozen and I couldn't lace mine well as a result and my feet were very cold despite the fact that I put on dry socks which were by the way almost instantly wet. We met a nobo hiker who asked us to stop at Derick Knob shelter and ask another nobo to bring the Sawyer filter left behind to the Silers Bald shelter and so we did. For miles we hiked layered. I wore my raincoat under my puffy for a while because it was so cold and windy but as we began climbing I shed my outer layer. We climbed Thunderhead Mt while being tortured by windblown ice coming off the trees and pelting us in the head, face and neck. As the day progressed the sun shone through a bit longer each time it forced it's way through the clouds. By the time we reached the summit of Rocky Top mountain it was steadily shining but had yet to melt the white topped trees and the contrast over the mountains of brown and white was beautiful. We'd met a nobo hiker named Stretch on the climb up and he'd found a tent. The group of women relaxing on the grassy bald between Thunderhead and Rocky Top asked if we'd seen a tent rainfly and thus I put them in touch with Stretch. It's too much of a coincidence to think it's not the item Stretch found. It was glorious in the sunshine there on that little knoll and the best part of the day so far. We went ahead to the summit of Rocky Top for an even more fulfilling view. The sun was out fully now and we had shed some layers. We sat on the side of the trail in some grass and had lunch before tying our wet clothes to our packs so they could dry as we hiked. When we reached Spence Field shelter Michael was in need of the privy and water but the side trail was .2 to the shelter and another .1 to water. He dropped his pack and ran while I sat at the corner and snacked. I didn't stay long before tackling the final 2.9 miles to Russell Field shelter. That section of the trail turned out to be the best section all day with fairly level and smooth trail filled with rhododendron tunnels and pure joy. I arrived at Russell Field to find one space empty and announced that we had 2 reservations as section hikers. I know I fibbed but last night was ridiculous and as soon as I spoke it a hiker around my age jumped right up and was very happy to volunteer to tent, which was his preference. Everyone was happy and I took my spot just as Michael popped in exclaiming how much he had also enjoyed that last section of trail. We made our beds, and made dinner out in the cold but sunny area out front and discussed eating inside the shelter before being scorned by a young male hiker. Ultimately we went around the side of the shelter where the wind was blocked and ate there before Michael hung our bags and we crawled into our beds. He got up twice to retrieve things from his hung bag having forgotten to make sure he had everything he needed. I've done that too, very annoying. We were both concerned about the fires being built in the fireplace inside and the ring outside but everyone was respectful of hiker midnight and as the sun slipped away so did the chatter. I hope tonight is not as cold and I'm happy our plan worked well, our clothes were still dry and now our previously frozen hiking clothes were also dry. But boy do our boots stink!","Silers Bald shelter

Puddles,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610723,"I got up at 3am to pee and the wind was calm.and the moon was so bright I didn't need a headlamp. I went around the corner of the shelter and just as I was tidying up a male hiker headed towards me with the same need for relief. He noticed me when I spoke and quickly deviated away. That was close!  During breakfast this morning Michael told me that he had mice encounters both at Silers Bald shelter and here at Russell Field. To be honest I'd forgotten about the mice but I too used to lay awake on watch as they ran by my face and over my hair. They no longer keep me awake, they just seem normal now. He wasn't complaining but he didn't look impressed either, having thought about where all the poop might be. I ate my oatmeal and he his Mountain House breakfast skillet, the thought and of which made me a bit queasy. Today would be my last day on trail and I'd just spent my last night. I looked at the shelter one more time and the new hikers with less than 200 miles under their boots and thought how their adventure was just beginning and mine is at its end. As I walked away it choked me up. But I still had 14.1 miles to roll over before I reached it and I was going to savor it. Today was going to be beautiful.  The sun was shining and the temps warming nicely as we set out. I hiked in my skirt and long sleeve shirts but on the first climb up to Devil's Taters I changed into my short sleeve shirt as did Michael. The hikers we passed today were more eager to chat and were definitely having a better time at this difficult task with the improved weather. We said hello to the loan hiker at Mollies Ridge shelter as we passed by. As we climbed Doe Knob we saw a white tail flash by. It was a tougher climb than I wanted today but I knew it was one of the last. We climbed up and down camel humps before finally reaching the junction of the trail leading to the summit of Shuckstack Mt and the fire tower. I knew at this junction the trail would then lead me down 4.6 mi to Fontana Dam and the completion of my journey. We parked our bags on the side of the trail and trekked up to the tower climbing it for the ultimate view of Fontana lake and Dam in the surrounding mountains. It was a pretty incredible moment for me as I had already been emotional off and on on the 10 miles thus far. After we had our fill of photography we descended the trail to have lunch where we had left our bags. as I unpacked and began eating Michael ran off to use the restroom and when he returned he brought Christine with him. She had hiked up the 4.6 mile ascent so that she could hike out with us. It was fantastic having both of their company on this final descent. They insisted I lead the steady descent to the dam and I did. A few times I caught myself with tears running down my cheeks. It's bitter sweet. I'm ready to go home and be with my husband and family but I love this trail and what it's done for me. I've definitely grown as an individual. As we reached the end of the Great Smokey Mountain National Park I saw the thru hiker box for deposit of Backcountry permits for nobo hikers and I realized I'm really near the end. The last of my hike would be on pavement. We were all pretty hot with the temps in the high 70s and the sun shining without tree cover and joked about jumping in the lake. I completely would have if the opportunity had presented but as it turns out there's no access to the lake in this area. as I walked across the dam I was torn between wanting to rush and wanting to stall but I kept a steady Pace admiring the beauty and stopping for a few photos before reaching my final destination, a sign for the Appalachian Trail with an N and an S next to the sign for the visitor center. This was it, I've connected all the blazes. 2,190.9 miles between Maine and Georgia and I hiked every single one of them. Incredible. I'm proud of myself. 
I used the restroom and washed my hands, twice. I was really dirty and the soap and water felt amazing. Then we checked in at the visitor center and I got a stamp on my passport and logged onto their WiFi so I could call Brian. After an emotional conversation I watched the Marco Polo video he'd sent me and I cried. I had one more white blaze to hike past. The one he has painted on a tree alongside our driveway. I can't wait to see that in person and jump into his arms. But before then I have unfinished business here. A shower, a celebratory dinner and beer with Michael and Christine and a good night's sleep. It's been incredibly wonderful to have their help and company in these last few days. Tomorrow I'll get some new shoes and some clothes to wear so I can see my niece and nephew in something other than stinky hiker clothes. I haven't seen them since they were very young and they don't remember me. I'm very excited to see them and begin a new relationship with them and their families. A new chapter in the stroll for my soul on the path of my courage to heal. The","Russell Field shelter
