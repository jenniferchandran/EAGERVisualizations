Yodaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603059,"The ranger told me to take the Len Foote section of the approach trail which adds a mile to the route, but passes by the Hike Inn after about 5 miles. According to my phone I walked 10.8 miles although the trail maps say it was 9.8 miles. I tried to make my pack as light as possible but 5 days of food (10lbs) and 3 liters of water (6lbs) got my total weight up to 38 lbs. I drank every bit of the water and probably sweated out the same amount. This was the first time I hiked using poles and I will have to say they were great. They saved me from going down on more than one occasion. They also took stress of my knee which held up quite well. It is not sore and does not appear swollen. On the Len Foote portion of the approach trail I saw 15-20 people. After I got back on the main approach trail, I only passed one person. I got to the shelter at 4:30 and at 5:00 the storms rolled in. It is still thundering now at 7:30. When I got to the shelter, Andre was already here. He is doing a 4 day hike. He graduated from Penn State 3 years ago and is figuring out what to do. In the middle of the downpour a couple carrying their dog showed up soaking wet. We were making room for them for in the shelter when they decided to set up their tent. Hopefully the dog will bark if the bears show up. I helped him with his pack and it must have weighed 65 pounds. My pack fits well and I finished the day without any blisters on my feet so that has to go down as a win. It would be a long 12 days with an uncomfortable pack or shoes that did not fit. I can definitely feel the workout. I am Trying to do 16 miles tomorrow so we will see how that goes. I need to push it so hopefully I can get to Mountain Crossings before the hurricane rains hit. Not sure I can get there but if I can stay there for at least the second 1/2 of the storm I will be happy. The rain today was great since I got to rinse out my hiking clothes which were ripe after the heat and mileage today. I am guessing the trail tomorrow will be a lot sloppier than it was today. I am thinking it will be a long night in the shelter since Andre is already snoring. He told me he will sleep til 10 (15 hours!). I had a lovely meal of freeze dried lasagna. The bears have evidently figured out the cable system so now there is a metal construction box to store food and anything with a scent. Since Max the dog is 10 yards away, I am planning on him being the alert system. Other than pretty woods the only thing I saw of significance was 2 gobblers and a big pile of bear scat (near the first shelter I passed). The first day was a success. We will see how I feel in the morning!","Aimcalola Falls State Park

Yodaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603060,"1st morning on the trail. They say sleep is important. Well that did not happen much last night. My $170 hi-tech fancy sleeping pad Would not stay inflated so I blew it back up at 10:30, 11:45, 2:30, 4, and 5:30. I bought it at Mountain Crossings so hopefully they can show me how to operate it or they will replace it. I also know why people don’t sleep in shelters. It is an interstate highway for mice. And sometimes they take a short cut straight across your body. That will definitely keep you awake. Sleeping in a shelter is much different that sleeping on my porch at Mountaintop.  As instructed, I used the bear box instead on the bear cables.  While the boxes might be bear proof, they are not mouse proof.  My food bag had a hole chewed right through it and the mice had a feast.  Fortunately, they don't seem to care for freeze dried food, only trail mix. I had my trail mix divided into individual 1/2 pound bags.  They ate 2 of them.  There must have been a lot of mice coming through there to eat a pound of trail mix.  They also ate the trail mix from the couple who showed up in the rain.  Andre was still sleeping when I left camp so I don't know what they ate out of his food bag.  At least the mice eliminated 1 pound of weight for me.","

Yodaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603061,"I made it 8.1 miles to Hawk Mountain Shelter. Here I stopped for a lunch of stream water, green belly meals to go bars, a cliff bar, some beef jerky and trail mix. I don’t have much of an appetite but know I need to eat so I can make it the next 7.6 miles. I am probably not too hungry cause this food is no good. I am going to spend the night at Gooch mtn shelter. I also rinsed out my shirt and bandana which are soaked. It is breezier today but I am still sweating like a pig. The couple from last night went the same way as me this morning. They were just in front of me pointing into the woods. I never saw it but they got pics of a momma and baby bear who had crossed the trail just in front of them. I would have liked to have seen it. They got off the trail at 3 forks which was 3.8 miles back. I have not seen anyone since then. Out for now.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Yodaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603062,"Friday evening. They say not to push it and now I know why. I went from Springer Mountain to Gooch Mountain shelter which is 15.7 miles with a lot of elevation change. I started about 9:15am and rolled into camp at 6:15 with only about a 30 minutes lunch break.  The seasoned hikers here at Gooch tonight were shocked. They said I did too much and there is no way I can make Neel’s Gap by Saturday night. I have been trying to get to Neels' Gap to get in the Mountain Crossings Hostel in time to avoid the forecasted 24 hours of rain coming from Hurricane Florence.  The veterans said I should be doing 8-10 miles per day. Based on the case of chafing I created today, I think they are correct. I am going to have to re evaluate tomorrow morning. I have smeared everything with neosporin and body glide. Hopefully a night of fresh air will improve things. Walking for 9 hours in soaking wet clothes (from sweat) was a big mistake. After last nights mouseapalooza, I opted for my tent. It was easy to set up and has plenty of room. I also set up my bear bag (PCT style) so we will see what critters find it tonight. The weather today was still warm but I’ll take that over rain. My pack and shoes are good. No injuries there. My knee also is holding up just fine. I still have no appetite which is good for weight loss but not so good for energy. It did not help that I used too much water in my freeze dried pasta primavera tonight. It was more like nasty soup and I did not eat 1/3 of it. There are at least 15-20 folks here tonight and some are rather rowdy. However, this is the first night in camp for the ones I talked to. Most are heading south and most are doing 2-3 days. I enjoyed the sights and sense of accomplishment, but this day makes me think I am more suited for glamping.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Yodaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603063,"Woke up this morning after another night of minimal sleep. Since the mice could not find my food and were unable to race across my body, they decided to use my tent as a trampoline. My tent does not have a fly, so I enjoyed flicking some of them far off into the woods. When I retrieved my bear bag that morning, nothing had found it, so a PCT style hang is definitely the way to go. My rash created from the previous day has not improved and there is no way I can hike much today. Fortunately, I overheard one of the hikers mentioning that he was getting picked up by a shuttle and driven back to Atlanta. I told him I would split the cost if I could ride back with him and he readily agreed. The 1.2 mile hike to Gooch Gap to meet the shuttle was more than enough to convince me I had made the right decision. I had to walk holding my jewels up out of the way so the sandpaper chafing action was held to a minimum. Shuttle driver Ron showed up right on schedule and just like that we were off the trail and on our way back to Atlanta. Ron earns every cent because I spent the ride back to Atlanta trying to decide if I was smelling myself or the hiker in the front seat who let me tag along. I know I was quite stinky, but I think he was the winner with his case of ""swamp ass"". I guess that is why Ron kept his window down all the way to Atlanta, or up into NC.  Ron is a well known shuttle driver and frequently travels to and from Atlanta and charges reasonable rates  Ron Brown  706-669-0919 Ron's Shuttle Service","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Yodaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603071,"Things definitely happen for a reason.

Within 24 hours of leaving the trail, my sweet mother-in-law passed away.  I think it was divine intervention that enabled me to be home when Laura got the call.

Here are some things I will do differently when I get back on the trail.

Don’t try to do too many miles. 8 -12 per day is plenty depending on elevation change

Don’t attempt too large of a section at one time.  There were many hikers at Gooch Mountain Shelter who have completed many states in 3-4 day chunks.

Don’t carry too much food.  I was never hungry on the trail and had to force myself to eat.  I also carried fancy backpacking food.  The freeze dried nighttime food is fine, but all the bars that were for lunch and breakfast were hard to eat.  The next time I am going to carry Little Debbie oatmeal crème pies, cheez-its, and other junk food that tastes good.

Be mindful of how much water is available on various sections.  There was so much water on the section I did that I could have carried 1 – 1.5 liters instead of the three I was carrying.

Go with a couple of friends.  Everyone I met on the trail was nice and friendly, but going with your own friends will definitely make it more enjoyable.

Take Ambien.  Even though I was very tired, I never slept much.  Mice are everywhere and you hear their pitter patter all night long.  You also hear every other person in camp.  Sleeping in the woods is not the same as passing out on my porch on a sofa after a big meal and several glasses of wine.

Here are some things I did correctly.

My shoes, socks, poles, pack, tent, cook set, stove, water filtration were all great.  I think my sleeping pad is the right choice, but unfortunately, I ended up with a defective one.  If the weather is going to be warm, I will only take a top quilt.  I did not get inside my sleeping bag until 2-3am and never zipped it up.  And my sleeping bag is rated for 30 degrees, so it was not a heavy bag.

I look forward to a return trip either later this year or early next year.  I will try to pick a 3-4 day window with moderate weather that is not in the thru hiker season.  Evidently March, April and October get very crowded on the Ga section due to nice weather and the thru hikers.

My sister and her husband have done this before me and want to go again, so they will be willing partners.","Gooch Gap
