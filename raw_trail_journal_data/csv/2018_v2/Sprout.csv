Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603142,"Day 22 Canopus Lake Beach camping to Morgan Stewart Shelter, NY (14 mi) 
We got a leisurely late start today, but knew it was a short day and the weather was MUCH cooler! We both started off in pants, but realized it wasn’t quite cool enough for that and switched back into shorts eventually.
Jamie’s mysterious foot rash seems to have chilled out some today, so that’s good (we think maybe it’s from the permethrin?).
I started off my day with pretty horrific period cramps.  The first 4.5 miles were slow and sloggy.  We made it to the RPH shelter where I laid on a lawn chair and rested for a while.  The cramps subsided and the next section was MUCH better!
We hiked 5 more miles to a deli where there was well water from a spigot.  It was 0.5 miles off trail on a very sunny and busy road, so we agreed to hitch a ride back to the trail head when we left the deli.  We got some snacks, sat down, and took a nice afternoon break.  We were able to get a ride from someone in the parking lot back to the trail head which was nice!
The next 4.5 miles to the shelter were a little harder motivation-wise.  I turned on some music and put one foot in front of the other until I got to the shelter.  When I got there, Jamie had already set up our tent, and I met a few other hikers at the picnic table.  
Hoping for an early start tomorrow.  My best days or miles are early in the day.  As the afternoon wears on it tends to get harder and harder to keep going.
I lost a bit of motivation today.  Really wondering and checking in with why I am out here.  I desperately need to have one while good day, start to finish.  Or maybe a few.  Being out here and feeling miserable has begun to wear on me.  My heart needs to feel inspired and reconnected to my purpose so I can have some motivation to keep going.  I started to think about being out here for months and it began to feel quite overwhelming and maybe not doable.  I just need a good day.
Day 23: Morgan Stewart Shelter, NY to Ten Mile River Shelter, CT (21 mi)
OMG TODAY ROCKED!  I got a pretty early start, which I know made a big difference.  I was on trail at 5:40 am.  Jamie packed up the tent and was on trail by 6:00 am.  He caught up to me about 5 miles in and we stopped at our first water stop for the day at the Telephone Pioneers Shelter (7.8 mi from our start).  We actually were good on water and Jamie had been in touch with Robin and Gillian who were meeting up with us today to hike and bring us our resupply.  We realized that they were going to be meeting us a lot sooner than we had initially thought, and only had 3 more miles to hike to the train station where they would meet us with water.  The temps were cool enough that we really hadn’t had much water that morning and could make it to meet them before filling up.
We walked into the parking lot of the AT “train station” JUST as our friends all pulled in.  Jess & Alex, who had received about 6 boxes for us in the mail (THANKS!!!) dropped Robin & Gillian off to hike with us. G & R parked their car about 7 miles down the trail.  It was perfect timing and perfectly planned!  
The next 7 miles were beautiful trail and just flew by with good company! They are such a fun couple and we had so many good laughs hanging out together! We got to their car and they had heaven on earth awaiting our arrival: cold kombucha, beer, fresh mango, watermelon, cherries, dark chocolate, vegan baked goods, cookies, and coconut water! Omg it was so amazing and delicious!
After feasting, sorting through all of our mail and resupply boxes, and hanging out for quite a while, Robin pulled out some hair clippers to take to Jamie’s head.  Not too long ago, Jamie gave Robin a surprise clipper haircut at a frisbee tournament and Robin got to have his revenge today and he shaved Jamie’s head!
We entered CT and only had 2.8 miles to Ten Mile River Shelter, but it was up and over a nice hill the whole way.  Robin and Gillian offered to drop off our resupply in Kent, CT so we could delay the pain of heavy packs one more day.  THANKS GUYS!
We washed off in a nice flowing river right by our shelter and had the place practically to ourselves.  We carried a dinner with us out of habit, but we were both so full from feasting with G&R that we decided not to make dinner. We set up our tent and had an easy, early night.  There is a bear box here, so no bear bagging either!  
We got in our tent and called Robbie in Colorado, as he had just finished the Leadville 50 miler in 10 hours! It was so exciting to catch up with him and hear about his race.  Inspiring stuff for sure!
I needed to have a good day and I got one.  A 20+ miler with good weather, lots of fun and laughter, lots of eating and hanging out, and just overall mentally easy miles today. The trail didn’t feel technical today, it was smooth and easy walking.  I am so grateful for today.  
Seeing and being with friends fills my heart and lifts my spirits in a whole new way out here.  We are a species that is meant to interact and I think too much alone time can wear on a person.  In Austin I was feeling like more and more of an introvert and could really see myself being perfectly content spending time alone.  But then when I’m actually faced with what it is to be alone for hours on end each day I find that a conversation with another person fuels me and fills me up.
 And when it is someone I know, Katie & Brad, Robin & Gillian, it fills me up that much more.  It truly impacts my motivation and I didn’t really realize how much human interaction fills my bucket.  Even yesterday, when I got to the shelter, I chatted with 3-4 other hikers, all new to me, and I felt so much happier and alive from those moments of conversation and human interaction.  Being heard, and listening.  It fills me up, makes me smile, and carries me. 
Day 24: Ten Mile River Shelter, CT to Kent, CT (8.7 mi)
We slept in this morning and hit the trail around 8:30 thinking we only had 9 miles into town and it would be ok to just sleep in. It was a little chilly last night without the rainfly on and my ankles and feet were definitely cold with my 3/4 length sleeping pad.  I think I will want a full length pad for the fall for chillier nights.
The morning was absolutely gorgeous.  We walked along a river and it was just a beautiful river full of rapids and fast moving water.  It mesmerized me and had me totally captivated.  It was definitely distracting me from making forward progress, but that’s ok!
This morning was hard.  A lot of slow and challenging miles.  It was much more technical than yesterday and it started to get really hot around 10 am.  We ran out of water at one point, but luckily we were only 0.7 mi from a water source.  
We got to the trail intersection with the road that leads to town.  We had quite a few errands to run.  Luckily, we got a ride into town from someone.  We went to the IGA (grocery store), got some Thai vegan peanut noodles in the prepared food section, an apple, a banana, vegan yogurt, olives, and a pickle.
We found a grassy shady spot in the parking lot with a chair and a picnic table and ate our lunch feast.  The post office was right there so Jamie went to go get his new pack! 
On our zero day he talked to a customer service rep at Osprey and sent them pictures of his old pack which was tearing at multiple seams, and they guaranteed him a new pack and arranged to send it to him to the post office in Kent, CT.  He got the men’s version of my pack, the Exos 58L.  He’s very excited about the new pack and the fact that Osprey replaced it for free made him giddy.
Then he went to ACE hardware (also in the shopping center) and bought some permethrin to treat his new shorts and shirts (he had Erin from home send to us), his new pack and MY NEW SHOES!
Yep! I got a pair of the Brooks Cascadia and I’ve only hiked about 10 miles on them but so far I think good? I have a lot of toe blisters, so nothing feels great, and they might be slightly big, but I think I can work around that with lacing.  Erin also sent me my custom orthotics that I use in my Mizunos for running back at home, so hopefully those help! Although I do have to say that my foot pain has subsided and I’m just battling some toe blisters, a tender heel blister, and the same bottom of foot tightness and knots.
As we were hanging out in the hot parking lot for a few hours while Jamie went to the post office multiple times, I was really starting to feel my energy fade.  Once all the permethrin stuff was dry, we packed up and walked to the outfitter where Robin and Gillian left our resupply box yesterday.  We got our stuff, and it was 4:40 pm and 88 degrees out.  I was so tired I convinced Jamie to just call it a day.
I checked on Guthook and saw a lot of recommendations for a hiker’s cabin at “Karen’s house”, so I called Karen and she came to pick me up.  Omg! It was the most epic cabin ever! Right on the same river that captivated me this morning but on the opposite side of the river.  We ate dinner on the deck overlooking the river and chatted with a few other hikers. We took hot showers in the outdoor shower and slept in sheets on a king sized bed.  This place was truly a gem.
Day 25: Kent, CT to Caesar Brook Campsite (13.7 mi)
Whew! It took us 9.5 hours to walk less than 14 miles!  I really don’t even understand! HEAVY PACKS today.
The first 4.7 miles were quite tough, steep and technical.  We got a later start than I would have liked considering we had very full packs and it was going to get into the 90s again today with immense humidity.
At the end of the 4.7 miles we had a VERY steep and sketchy downhill from St. John’s Ledges into the Housatonic valley.  
Once we arrived in the Housatonic Valley we walked on a very nice and easy flat path that went along a GORGEOUS river, the Housatonic.  It was such a fast flowing river with so many rapid bits here and there.  The sound of the flowing water was like music to my ears; changing pitch with its different speeds.  The path reminded me of being on the hike and bike trail in Austin, but with a faster, more shallow river full of rocks and rapids.  
We found a spot to swim in that seemed private enough.  Swimming is mostly done naked because I don’t like having wet undergarments, so we sometimes have to time it well as there were others along the path this morning.  The swim felt glorious.  It always feels so rejuvenating to submerge my whole body in cold, flowing water.  
After the Housatonic river we had a big climb and then a big decent.  I crushed the climb!  It felt so good!  I was sweating so much, it was the hottest part of the day, I wore my insect net around my head (which added more warmth to the mix), but I still crushed the big climb.  I was a little more cautious on the decent and Jamie passed me going down.  I felt like I was having a good day considering all my foot blisters, super heavy pack, and the heat.
We realized we didn’t have our lighter, so jamie hitched a ride into town to get two more lighters while I chilled and swam at a brook right at the road intersection.  This second swim felt GREAT.  So refreshing.
The last part of the day consisted of a lot of climb-y bits. Nothing too long, but a few steep sections.  The gnats, black flies and mosquitoes were awful and we wore our bug nets around our heads basically all day.
We got to camp, I made Daiya mac’n’chz (our heaviest dinner), Jamie bear bagged, we hung our sweaty clothes up to dry and it will be an early bedtime for us.
We added quite a few things to our packs this last resupply: Cliff chews (thanks Huckabees!), Skratch packets, nuun, gels, and gummy bears.  This weighs quite a bit extra.  I’m also carrying three extra insoles (factory, dr. Scholls, and superfeet) and Jamie has a few extra outfits that “weigh nothing.”  We definitely have added some items to our packs and they are feeling heavier than they’ve felt thus far, so we may need to shake out again and make sure to eat all our food!
Tomorrow the temps are supposed to be much cooler with the high being 80 degrees.  I’m hoping for another good day tomorrow!
Day 26: Caesar Brook Campsite to Mt. Prospect peak, stealth camping (14 mi)
We hit the trail with two back to back climbs this morning. The second one had The Boulder Split, which was a narrow section between boulders.  
Jamie had a tough day today.  He was complaining about his ankle and knee hurting and his pack feeling heavy.  I, however had a good day, so I guess we’ll just take turns with who feels bad and who feels good.
I was right behind Jamie when I saw him jump pretty high in the air! Another Timber Rattle snake! He was a big one! We waited and watched him as he crossed the trail and headed into the woods again. Phew! It certainly startled Jamie!
We took a quick break at an overlook before descending into town-landia.
The descent was quick and easy trail.  The sounds of trains, race cars and civilization were nearby all morning, teasing us about how close they really were.
Once we got to the bottom of the descent, we decided to get lunch and hang out at Mountain Side Cafe, a very cute farm to table cafe only 0.25 mi off trail.  It was SO worth it! Delicious vegan options, and we had a chance to just sit, charge our phones, wash our hands and use the bathroom as often as humanly possible.  
We hung out there for quite a while because we only had 4 more miles to hike after. We finally left, walked along some roads in some residential areas and then along the Housatonic river again. We sort of swam but kind of aborted the mission halfway into it because we decided the water was too dirty.
Then we had our final climb of the day where we decided to stealth camp at the summit.  We had read on Guthook that there was space for one tent at the top of Mt. Prospect, so we were hoping no one else would see it and snag it up first.  We got there and no one was there, so we set up camp and had an early night on a breezy summit.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603141,"Day 34: North Adams, MA to intersection for Bennington, VT (18.4 mi)
We started off today with a nice climb out of town up to the mountains.  I kept feeling like Massachusetts wanted to make sure we remembered that there was tough terrain there. The last climb out of MA was a bit challenging.  I also think we needed to warm up our hiking muscles and feet again after the zero day.  The first few miles of the climb we walked along a beautiful brook and saw a spring bubbling right off the trail.  It was pretty idyllic.
We climbed for 4 miles and at the top we reached the Vermont border! Yes! A new state!! We met a Dad and his son there and the son (20) was starting the Long Trail and his pops was seeing him off.
We walked along the ridge for a bit and walked in plenty of mud.  Vermont is known for its mud, especially in the early season, but today we walked through more mud than we have this whole time, so it is definitely living up to its nickname of Vermud.
We crossed the road that leads into Bennington, Vermont and crossed a small footbridge over a very large creek. There were a few tent sites so we decided to set up our tent and call it a day.  Ate penne for dinner and chatted with a few other hikers.
The weather today couldn’t have been more perfect. The high was 80 and the low was 50. I wore my pants again, which definitely felt better for bug protection, and was super comfortable temperature-wise all day! Yay!
Day 35: Bennington, VT tentsite to Story Spring Shelter (19 mi):
Brrrr! Last night was chilly! It dipped down into the upper 40s.  I slept with earplugs in for the first time because we were so close to a road.  It seemed to really help.
We got kind of a late start because it was too hard to get out of our sleeping bags in such frigid weather.  Hit the trail by about 8 am with a nice steep climb.  
We ended up walking with another hiker, Josh, and his dog for some miles and the chatting helped the miles go by.
We took our first break 10 miles in at a shelter after much climbing.  Made afternoon smoothies, chatted with Earthheart a bit, and then continued on to the next shelter, 4 miles away. 
Got to the next shelter, hung out with Earthheart again, and we pushed on another 4.6 miles to Story Spring shelter.
We had quite a climb leaving that last shelter, and I was moving slowly.  I ate two caffeine cliff chews and about 15 minutes later I started to feel a surge of energy.  I put in a headphone and listened to some music and started running down the descent.  The descent was rolly, not very steep, but sort of technical.  It was filled with rocks, roots, stream crossings, and mud pits.  At certain moments I felt like I was dancing with the rocks, moving rhythmically in between them as I flew.  Running felt so good and so fun. I didn’t feel stiff with my poles, and I wasn’t overthinking the challenging bits.  I almost fell a few times, but my poles caught me.  I was having so much fun I didn’t want it to end.  
I got to the shelter and proposed going another 2.6 miles, but Fresh Feet was done for the day.  Bean was at the shelter! Yay! I have no idea how we caught her, but it was exciting to hang out again! We had dinner, convo, and laughs with Bean and Earthheart and a bunch of other hikers came in for the night. 
Day 36: Story Spring Shelter to Manchester, VT (21.1 mi) JAMIE’S birthday!!!
We reunited with Bean! It was so fun having a hiking buddy again today! 
We started off today climbing Stratton Mountain, and climbed the tower at the top for a BEAUTIFUL view all around.
After the 3 mile descent we ended up at Stratton Pond, where I took a quick dip and we had our pm smoothies.
The next 10.5 miles were relatively flat and easy walking, Bean and I stuck together and chatted about the last three weeks apart as well as other convo.  The miles flew by.  I was so astonished by our pace.  It’s amazing how company can really help with pace!
We got to the parking lot at about 4:30 and waited a little while for Jamie’s friend Derek to pick us up.  Jamie had gotten in touch with him yesterday on a whim to see if he was around and available to hang out and maybe host us.  Derek and Jamie basically share birthdays (1 day apart), so it would be pretty perfect to get to celebrate birthdays together.  We invited Bean along as well.
Derek pulled up and we went to a grocery store and got local veggie burger patties and salad ingredients for dinner.  It turns out that they were having friends over for dessert because one of their friends ALSO has a July 21 birthday.
We made a big vegan feast (Derek’s lovely wife Teri is also vegan), and had dessert and mingled with good people.  We had a fire in the back, kids were jumping on the trampoline, the two dogs were running around chasing each other, and it was just a completely different scene than trail life.  We had been plopped into a community and it felt so good and comforting.  Their home was just so full of love, warmth, and laughter and it filled my heart.
*** WE HIT 500 miles today!!! ***
Day 37: Manchester, VT to Peru Peak Shelter (10 mi)
We went to bed at about 1 am and I really didn’t get much sleep at all.  Bean and I shared bunk beds and she kind of snored and was up at 6, so I didn’t get the rest I needed.
We ate the brunch to beat all brunches at Derek and Teri’s this morning.  Teri whipped up and amazing tofu scramble and we had bagels with hummus, avocado and microgreens on them.  It was SO DELICIOUS!
We were slow to leave the house and didn’t hit the trail until probably close to 1:00.  I was totally worthless today.  When I’m sleep deprived I feel like I’m a zombie walking.  I was just totally zapped of all energy.  I felt like I could fall asleep on the ground.
We had two climbs today, Bromley Mtn and Styles Peak.  It was super misty and foggy the whole time with winds blowing the rain off the leaves onto us.  The forecast said it was supposed to rain pretty badly today, but we didn’t get rained on much.  Everything was really wet.  Descending on slippery rocks made me super nervous and slow. The slick rocks looked metallic in the light today.  The way the light came through the thick cloud coverage reminded me of golden hour light, and it made some of the rocks look shimmery like silver, bronze and gold. 
We stopped at the top of Bromley Mtn and hung out a little in the ski patrol hut.  The last 0.3 mi up Bromley were on the ski path which was kind of cool.  We hear the summit is usually pretty open and there are nice views, but today we were totally in a cloud.
We got some trail magic (banana and chips for me) in between the two peaks from a guy who had just completed the Long Trail.  It is just so nice of people to buy food and bring it out to us.  I thought it was cool that he was a fellow hiker returning to the area to sprinkle some happiness on us.
We didn’t see any hikers after the Bromley summit until the shelter.  The weather made everything feel a little eerie and creepy. There were winds blowing the fog and you couldn’t see too far in any direction.
We shared the shelter with Wanderer, NoBo from Germany, and another SoBo hiker. No tent tonight because rain is in the forecast.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603140,"Day 38: Peru Peak Shelter to Danby, VT (8 mi)It absolutely poured rain all night.  Luckily we opted to stay in the shelter due to the rain forecast, but man, the pelting rain drops on the metal roof of the shelter kept me up and I had a pretty sleepless night. Again.My hiking was labored and sluggish. Just like yesterday.  I was so fatigued and sleepy with every step. Something seemed  off because my lack of energy was kind of incredible. Im not usually that fatigued.It was a rainier hike than yesterday as well.  When we got to the summit of Baker Peak, which was a slippery, steep, and rocky summit, we had cell service and decided to ask Jamies friend Dawn to come and get us a little earlier than previously planned so we could escape the rain and because my fatigue was paramount.As we started to descend it started to really pour on us.  My pants were plastered to my legs and each step was in a giant puddle as the trail turned to small streams.We finally got to a shelter and took a small break.  The rain did not let up.  We decided to press on. 3 more miles.We got to the parking lot and I did a quick outfit change from wet to dry so I didnt get too cold.  Jamie had been hiking with his umbrella and was relatively dry.We met up with Dawn and her daughter Onora and we went to a very cute little cafe to have lunch.  We plan to take the rest of today and tomorrow off to hang out with them, do some laundry, shower and rest.Day 39: zero day in Poultney, VTWe had a leisurely morning at Kyle and Dawns house. We opened our resupply box from Kate and found SO MANY GOODIES inside (including homemade vegan chocolate chip cookies!!!) Thank you Kate! We devoured most of the snacks instantly and Im so excited about adding fruit leather and Skratch bars to our mix (Thank you Kate!! ). We went to Fair Haven for lunch and errands and ate delicious vegan paninis at a local cafe.  When we got home, I passed out again for a nap (took a very long nap yesterday as well and could have kept sleeping if I hadnt been woken up for dinner).  The fatigue was so strong I could barely speak.  The only reason I woke up was because I was sweating, otherwise I think I could have kept sleeping.  I think my body was definitely fighting a virus or bacteria.Shortly after I woke up from my nap, more college friends of Jamies came to visit us! Jordan, Laura, and their adorable 3 year old Eloise came for the afternoon/evening.  They also brought us resupply goodies in the form of dark chocolate which we devoured and relished! THANK YOU!We all went to a local swimming spot in a river for the afternoon as it was pretty warm out (88 degrees and no A/C).  I felt super sleepy and out of it and had a few bouts of diarrhea, so I knew I wasnt doing well and glad to have the zero day.We went out to dinner with everyone and the kids and stopped by a playground on the way home.  This wasnt just any playground, it had a zip line swing that was legit! (Among other features!)We went back home and I continued to have diarrhea and went to bed on the earlier side.Day 40: Danby, VT to Clarendon Shelter (15.7 mi)Woke up and had more diarrhea.  I wasnt too sure how today was going to go if I was still maybe fighting off some type of sickness, so I would just take it chunk by chunk knowing that there were potential bail out spots for Kyle/Dawn to come get us at.We hit the trail around 9:15 ish this morning.  We took a short break 2 mi in at Little Rock Pond which was beautiful.  Climbed for a while up to a rock garden where we took another break.  It started to rain on us, wore the rain jacket for the descent, but it wasnt too bad.  When we got to the bottom of the descent at Bully Brook, we took another break.  I had to take my shoes off to cross the brook to not get my shoes completely drenched.  I rinsed my socks in the brook because they were dripping with brown mud, and switched to dry socks.  I put my rain jacket away because it was drizzling slightly and we had a big climb ahead.The nameless peak we climbed up was a long climb.  I actually enjoyed it.  It was nice trail with switchbacks, but never ending climbing.  Jamie prefers the shorter and steeper climbs so he felt this climb was brutal.  We took a pack off break at the top to give our left shoulders a break.  For some reason we are both having issues with cramping in our left shoulders (especially with heavy fully resupplied packs).We descended to Minerva Hinchey Shelter and there was a group of adolescent boys from a nearby summer camp doing a 3 day hike. They were very sweet and curious.  A few of them said they were from Brooklyn, NY and had never been hiking before or spent more than 1 night away from home.  They were excited to tell us about the next 4 miles because that was what they had hiked that day.  One boy encouraged us by saying if we can do it, and were just little kids, you can do it!  We left the shelter and I felt in better spirits just from having those sweet interactions with middle school kids.  There is something truly special about that age group.We had a nice gradual descent for a while and then we had a 0.7 mi very steep and rocky descent down to a foot bridge and roaring river.  I slipped a few times but didnt really fall but Fresh Feet was going a bit quicker and fell a few times on the slippery rocks.We paused for a minute under Jamies umbrella at the footbridge as the rain picked up again.  After we crossed we only had 1.2 miles left to get to our shelter, but it was steep and rocky and we had to do a bit of scrambling.  I was really grateful to not be going down it.  It took us a while to get to the shelter because of this last challenging climb, but we finally made it.  I washed and changed at the water source and then we set up in the shelter, which had double wide bunks.  It is supposed to rain pretty hard tonight, so the shelter is pretty full.  I dont feel as fatigued as I was, so I think I may be over the hump.Day 41: Clarendon Shelter to Churchill Scott Shelter, VT (15 mi)Hit the trail around 8. It poured rain all night, so we were glad to be in the shelter.  I slept with ear plugs and I really think it helped. It was still a bit rainy most of the day.  We hiked 6.5 miles to the next shelter where we took a break from the rain before hitting the 4 mile climb up Killington Mountain, our first 4k-er.The climb wasnt that bad.  It got a bit steep and rocky towards the top, but it didnt last too long.  Once at the top, there was a lot of flat-ish trail before getting to the shelter at the top where we took a break.  The rocks, greenery and roots were so bright and beautiful at the top.  I really enjoyed the colors and the Christmas in a cloud feeling.At the top we took a break with some other hikers and I was pretty wet (mostly my sports bra from sweating during the climb. My rain jacket kept my shirt pretty dry).  I should have changed right away, but was hungry and not cold yet, so focused on making my soylent drink.  Then I changed into a dry sports bra and put on a long sleeve shirt and my buff as a hat, but it was too late.  I was SUPER cold and my whole body was shivering.  I threw on my rain jacket and started descending because I needed to move my body to warm up.  It took over an hour before I finally started to turn a corner.  Jamie gave me his buff to put around my neck and mouth, and the heat from my breathing helped warm me up some.  It was a bit scary dealing with that wee bit of pre-hypothermia, but all along I knew I had to keep moving to try to get my heart rate up to warm up my core.  I tried to run, but it was so slippery and rocky that I couldnt get much in because I had to be super careful with my footing.  I finally made it to the shelter at the bottom right when the sun started to peak out.  We hung all our wet clothes up and we had the shelter to ourselves. We decided to sleep in the shelter to not get the tent wet (ground and tent pad are wet), although not expecting rain tonight. Its pretty rare to have a shelter to ourselves because we have been running into folks doing the long trail each night, as well as quite a few SoBo-ers, but most people hiked 2 extra miles to get into Rutland to stay at the infamous Yellow Deli.  We felt that we had spent enough time off trail recently and that we would get an earlier start if we stayed on trail, hence the shelter.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603139,"Day 42: Churchill Scott Shelter to The Lookout hiker cabin, VT (19.2 mi) I cant believe weve been living in the woods for 6 weeks!We had a fairly uneventful morning.  Smooth and nice trail.  Took a break at an overlook with a nice view of Killington Mtn. Descended to Kent Pond where there was a nice lodge. Drank some electrolytes, used the bathrooms, and as we were about to leave, dark rain clouds and wind rolled in quickly and it looked like it was about to pour.  We waited about 20 mins, no rain, so decided to hike on.We had a pretty long and steep climb after that. Once we were at the top, the weather started to change and it started to really seem like it was going to rain.  We had a 3 mile descent until the next shelter, so we really tried to haul ass to get there before the storm.  The thunder progressed and got louder and every 10 mins or so the sky got a shade darker.  The booming thunder made me skittish like a little child afraid of storms and forced me to run.  I seriously felt like I was running out of fear of getting soaked.  I have never really felt that way about rain, but after the scary hypothermic incident yesterday I was a bit traumatized.We got to the shelter just in time! It didnt open up and pour like I expected it to (considering the very loud thunder), but it did rain for a little while.  We hung out with some section hikers and then headed out once the shower was over.It was late now and we still had 8.2 miles to go, with a LOT of climbing.  It was tough.  I sweat so much.  We finally made it to The Overlook and it smelled of mouse poop inside the cabin.  Last night a mouse chewed through my dry sack and my odor proof heavy duty food bag and chewed off part of my water bottle holder.  We also noticed while cooking dinner that they had been all over our kitchen stuff because our kitchen bags REEKED of mice, EW! We tucked the bags into our ziplock trash bag.  We shared the cabin with an older couple, Grandma Shorty and Plod Along, who had been through SO much adversity since their start in GA in February.  They were a funny couple, and we were so impressed and inspired by their tenacity at 61 years old.Day 43: The Lookout to Steves backyard, West Hartford, VT (20 mi) Today was an easy day.  The trail was all easy walking and we were actually able to run many parts of it.  We got an early start which was awesome.  On trail by 6:30, and with the nice cool morning and easy terrain we were able to cover ground with minimal effort.Just as we reached a road crossing where we took a break, we took a quick dip in a stream to rinse and cool off.  Then we took a midday break at Firefly and Loons back porch with a pretty big bubble of SoBo-ers.  It was just starting to get quite hot, so the break was much needed.  We had some climbing to kick off the afternoon and the next 4 miles to the shelter were brutally hot.  It was so humid out and we were quite sweaty.We got to the shelter and just as we arrived it started to rain.  There was no warning thunder this time. In fact, it was quite sunny out still.  We were so glad to take our break while waiting out the short rain storm.We started up again and about 10 minutes in it started to lightly rain again.  No problem though, the trail was easy and I decided to run (the rain only lasted like 45 mins or so).  I had so much fun running today.  Pack was light because tomorrow is our resupply day and the trail was a nice easy downhill for most of the afternoon.We arrived in West Hartford, a very tiny town with a few houses strewn along a road, and set up camp in the backyard of former thru hiker (of the PCT) Captain Stash.  He had a gazebo with outlets, picnic table, drinking water and a nice little swimming spot.  It felt like such an oasis after such a long day.Day 44: Steves backyard, West Hartford, VT to Hanover, NH (10 mi)Slept in a bit this morning.  Started the day out with about 4 miles of climbing, mostly easy, with a few steep sections.  After the climb it was mostly downhill with easy piney path.  I was able to jog parts of it and we booked it to Hanover in one full stretch with no breaks.  We hit Norwich, VT and had a lot of road walking in Norwich into Hanover.  We crossed the Connecticut River into NEW HAMPSHIRE! Woohoo!  We also hit the 600 mile mark at this time as well! Yay!We walked into a cute section of town near Dartmouth College with tons of restaurants and cafes and we landed at The Skinny Pancake and got vegan lunches there (Fresh Feet with the savory crepes and me with the Bahn Mi).  We then walked over to the North Face outfitter and picked up our resupply package (THANK YOU SONYA AND ALEX!) and got some odds and ends at CVS (earplugs and Gold Bond for Fresh Feet and lithium batteries for our GPS tracker which had run out the last few days).  Then a very nice shuttle driver (Dave Avery) picked us up and drove us to EMS & L.L. Bean, waited in the parking lot with andnaudio book while we shopped, and drove us to our homestay.  I got a new hat, its neon but lightweight - I accidentally left my visor and pink headband at a shelter.  I also got a new dry sack for my food bag since the rodents had chewed a hole in my old one.  Fresh Feet got a new fanny pack and some permethrin.Dave drove us to our Trail Angels house where we took hot showers, did laundry, and retreated our clothes with permethrin.  Our Trail Angel, Gregg Cook, was at a movie with his sister, so we made ourselves at home until he came home.  I was blown away by his generosity.  He had beds set up for hikers in the back of his house and just let us into his home without even meeting us.  His adult children had made him photo albums of each hiker he had taken in since 2011. He has hosted over 600 strangers in his home over the years!  I thought the albums were so sweet and it reminded me of my family and brought a few tears to my eyes.  I think if my dad lived on the AT he would be a trail angel like Gregg, and it touched my heart to see all the pictures and stories in the albums. Gregg came home and we visited for a bit.  He teaches a class at Dartmouth on the AT! How cool!  He then took us into town where we got Thai Food for dinner (thinking of Fresh Feets hit Thai song at this time...)!  Then a different shuttle driver drove us back to Greggs house (which was about a 10 min drive from Hanover).Hanover is trying to be the most hiker friendly town on the AT and has a list of Trail Angels with their numbers posted at various hiker boards.  Trail Angels are just super generous people who take in smelly, dirty strangers into their homes or give them rides.  Some leave out food and coolers or let you camp in their yard.  It amazes me how many people have such big hearts for us out here.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603138,"Day 45: Hanover, NH to Little Residence in Lyme, NH (17.4 mi)
Gregg (trail angel host) gave us a ride to Hanover where we had gotten off the trail yesterday and we continued walking through the town to the co-op where we used the bathrooms and Fresh Feet got coffee.  We realized that Fresh Feet forgot the toiletries bag at Gregg’s House! Noooooo!  Luckily, Gregg came back and picked him up and drove him back and forth to get it, while I did some catching up on the blog at the co-op.  This put us starting 1.5 hrs later than we wanted, but temps are cool here (60s), so it’s ok.
We hit the trail finally at about 9:30 am. We started off with very gentle terrain. Some climbing, some down, some flat, but all pretty nice for the first 8-9 miles.
After 3 mile road we had our first climb up Moose Mountain.  It was actually a nice climb, not too steep.   The next climb after Goose Pond was steeper and longer than each of us thought it would be.  Our heavy packs made us extra tired.  Cliff energy chews helped us climb.
On the way down (which was much easier), we saw some Chicken of the Woods mushroom (which we’ve seen a lot), but decided to harvest some because we knew we would be able to cook it tonight in a kitchen.  Our friend Chelsea Little, from RMBL (Crested Butte, CO) grew up just outside of Lyme, NH and was able to pick us up at the road crossing to Lyme!  
We got to her parent’s home and took hot showers and prepared the fungi for dinner.  It felt SO GOOD to sit down at a table and eat a family dinner.  We had some good conversation and laughs and our hearts and bellies were once again totally full.  
It was so fun to see Chelsea again! It had probably been close to 10 years!  She lives in Switzerland now and just happened to be in the area today so our timing couldn’t have worked out better!
We set up our sleeping bags on the biggest most beautiful screened in porch on the back of a beautiful farmhouse built in 1830! Stayed up until about 10, so tomorrow won’t be a super early start.
Day 46: Little Residence in Lyme, NH to Beckett Brook stealth camping (14.5 mi)
We slept in! I didn’t get up until 7:15, it was amazing!  We got ready and the Littles dropped us off at the trail head around 8:15. I noticed my reservoir for my Hydrapak was leaking and my pack was totally soaked.  About 0.3 L had leaked out, but there was no obvious puncture in the bladder.  It was seeping through the seam that holds the pack together.  Such a bummer!  I transferred most of my water into my smoothie blender bottle and decided to give Hydrapak a call from the top of the mountain to see about a replacement.  
We began the gentle climbing up Smarts Mountain, then it began to get steeper.  The Littles told us that the last 0.6 of Smarts Mtn was very steep and covered with large slabs of rocks without much foot hold.  We got to a section that was like that, and seemed like maybe a summit, but I knew it wasn’t that difficult compared to what we’ve been climbing.  Fresh Feet thought we were at the summit when we got to a nice overlook, but it turned out to only be about halfway and we still had 2.1 mi left to get to the summit.  
It was pretty steep towards the summit, but it seemed like the people who maintain the trail have done a nice job of putting in rock stairs or rebar holds into the rocks.  They even built wooden steps over some of the rock part.  This helped tremendously because even though we had perfect weather, the rocks were all wet and slippery and totally smooth without any foot holds.
We arrived at the summit, finally, and climbed the fire tower for some spectacular views all around.  Fresh Feet went to get more water and we drank our afternoon smoothies while chit chatting with some day hikers.
We pressed on and descended with another NoBo-er we hadn’t met yet, On Step.  The descent was gentle and smooth with a few mud/swamp sections.  At the bottom of the descent there was a beautiful brook and other hikers were swimming in it.  We got water and decided to summit Mt. Cube and stealth camp at the bottom instead of calling it a day at Hexacuba Shelter.  It felt too early to be done and we had good weather today, so we decided to push on even though we were pretty tired.
Mt. Cube was a great climb and in some ways more challenging than Smarts Mtn.  There were a few small rock scramble parts and another false summit! It had a rocky summit (and false summit) and a lot of views.  We were pretty tired at the summit and were ready to get to camp.
The descent was a little trickier than what we’ve had lately, and reminded me of some of the trickier descents we‘ve had in the past.  We finally got to the brook where we had read there were some tent sites and someone had already set up their tent on the shore and there didn’t really seem to be a good place to set up our tent.  I got on Guthook and read the comments and someone had posted a few years ago that there were good tent spots 200 yds downstream from the trail crossing.  We checked it out and sure enough it was a beautiful spot to tent. 
We splashed off our bodies in the brook, made dinner (Lentils and Rice), hung our clothes up, bear bagged, set up tent, and called it a night.  Tomorrow is supposed
to be rainy starting at about 4:00 pm, so hoping to get our short day (12.4 mi) done before the rain.  We will stay in a shelter at the base of Mt. Moosilauke, which is the first of the White Mountains.  As of today, the forecast looks clear for Thursday, so we will summit Thursday and probably encounter some slippery rocks from the Wednesday rain. We’ve had a nice dry stretch and I’m beyond grateful for it.  
Day 47: Beckett Brook stealth camping to Jeffers Brook Shelter (12.4 mi)
Today was a relatively easy and short day, but my morning was plagued with uterus cramping.  My period never came today and the cramps subsided, which means it will likely come full on tomorrow on our first White Mountain, Mt. Moosilauke (biggest mountain yet at nearly 5k feet).  
The forecast said it was going to rain this afternoon and we got a few small drops on us as we arrived to the shelter, just in time.  There was no service at the shelter, so there was no way of telling if tomorrow is still clear of rain for our summit and steep descent down Moosilauke.
The shelter is pretty crowded tonight because of the rain and the big mountain, and the cigarette smoking right outside the shelter is quite bothersome to me.  I’m the only female.  Feels strange.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603137,"Day 48: Jeffers Brook Shelter to Eliza Brook Shelter (16 mi)
Omg.  Today was my toughest day yet!  There were so many layers that made today hard, tense, and pushed me to my limits.
I woke up at 5:00 am and got ready in the shelter before all the dudes began to stir.  Lucky me, I started my period!  Uggggh! AND it started to rain! Today was supposed to be totally clear.  It was light rain, but enough to make everything slippery.  I waited around until the rain let up, and left around 7:15 am.  
About 10 minutes into my walk my cramps hit me hard.  I took aleve, but I knew it was too late.  This climb was long, but the north side (our descent) was the treacherous part.  
The climb was supposed to be the easy part!  I struggled so much early on in the climb because I was dealing with so much pain from my cramps. I was just barely putting one foot in front of the other, sternum strap cinched and no hip belt.
I took a break while two other hikers were getting water at a stream crossing, just to not be alone in my misery.  I cried a little as I sat there in pain and discomfort knowing there was no bail out.
I pushed on, up the very steep and rocky path.  Eventually, Fresh Feet came back without his pack and offered to carry my pack for a little until we got to where he dropped his pack.  It was a solid 5-10 minutes of easy walking without my pack, and it did help.  At this point the aleve may have been kicking in some because I felt a little bit stronger and was in less pain, but still couldn’t use my hip belt (which pressed on my uterus in the most uncomfortable way imaginable!). 
Fresh Feet took a little bit of my pack weight in his pack until we got near the summit, when I took it back because I was feeling better.  The cramps came and went in waves and I was starting to feel good toward the top.  
Mt. Moosilauke is a GIANT hill.  Very long and steep up and very long and steep down.  By far the biggest climb/descent we have had thus far. The summit sits at nearly 5k feet high (tree line is at about 4,200 ft high) and has grassy fields on top.  Unfortunately, we hit the summit in a total cloud (again), so no view for us, BUT AT LEAST IT WASNT RAINING!  And the clouds added an eerie ambiance that was fun in its own way.  The winds at the summit were so strong they were pushing both of us around and it was very tough to walk with such intense and strong winds.  I had no interest in spending any time at the top because I knew if I stopped even for a little bit I would get cold extremely quickly.  The temps were chilly and the wind was ferocious.
We finally ducked down into the forest again and were shielded from the wind, but the long and tricky descent was still to come. We descended for 2 miles before it supposedly got “hard.”  I thought those first 2 miles were tough! The rocks were very slippery and I was slipping a lot and had to take it slowly and cautiously.  We took a break on trail where there was a sign for Beaver Brook Shelter. We didn’t have extra energy to go 0.3 mi off trail to the shelter to sit on a dry log to eat our snacks, so opted for the wet rock on trail.  
After this spot, the descent got real.  I can barely even describe it because I have subconsciously suppressed the memory of this part of the traumatic descent.  It was terrifying for me.  Absolutely terrifying.  I was so tense the entire time, barely putting one foot in front of the other.  The rocks were so steep, long, slippery and right on the edge of a rushing waterfall the entire way.  I think the sound and proximity of the gushing waterfalls created an extra layer of stress and anxiety that lingered in the background causing my full body to be tense.  It took us so long to get down.  There was a moment where I just didn’t even know if I could go on.  I know I didn’t have a choice, but I sat down for a little bit and just froze.  
Once we were down, we got water for smoothies and ate snacks and took a break, but it was 3:00 pm and we had only covered 8.4 miles! We still had 7.6 to go! Now I understand why most people do 10-14 miles in the Whites.  Everyone’s pace is just dramatically slower out here.
We pressed on, knowing it was going to be a very long afternoon.  The elevation profile didn’t look that tough, but the terrain was anything but easy.  There were not two steps in a row that I could take normally.  Literally every single step was off camber and involved some sort of obstacle.  The flatter sections are sometimes more difficult than the mountains due to the mud pits, root and rock jumbles and miscellaneous other toe traps.  
About 5 minutes into the climbing after we had descended Moosilauke I belly flopped on a boulder.  I think I had relaxed slightly since we were done with the hard part of the day and my toe caught a root and sent me flying forward and I landed on my belly on a boulder with both legs hanging in the air and both arms not able to touch the ground.  Once the momentum had me going forward the weight of the pack made it impossible to stop it from happening.  The fall really shook me up.  I felt like puking and I started to really sob.  I was so shaky. 
I finally started to walk again, trepidatiously, and slowly made forward progress.  I slipped and fell a SECOND time, and was pretty shaken up from it and the tears came out again.  This was going to be such a long day.  My progress was just so slow and emotionally I was rocked.  My cramps were coming back and the aleve was wearing off.  I took more aleve, and grappled with the fact that we still had 5 miles to go and it was 5:00 pm already.  Everything seems to take twice as long in NH.
I finally started to feel some strength and confidence come back and was able to make a good effort and push up Mt. Wolf.  Uphill climbing is my friend out here.  Maybe because I’m much less likely to fall and I can relax and push myself harder with more rhythm and comfort. 
It was starting to get dark and we still had a ways to go.  The terrain started to get a little more gentle and I was able to walk the last 1-2 miles more quickly and confidently.
We got to camp at 8:10 pm. It was dark and the shelter was full.  We were expecting rain beginning at midnight and lasting throughout the day tomorrow.  We did our camp chores in the dark with headlamps as fast as we could. No time to rinse in the brook so I used a wipe to half clean my muddy self.
Once we were laying in the tent I let it all out.  I had a good cry.  I was so tense so much of the day that my body needed an outlet and it all came out in tears. I think the high cortisol levels (stress hormone) from persistent sheer terror highly effected my nervous system today. 
I was finally able to go to sleep but it was 10:30 pm and I needed to get an early start.  The rain forecast for tomorrow looked like light rain possible in the morning, with heavier rains and possible thunder storms in the late morning/afternoon.  The first 4 miles of tomorrow would be the Mt. Kinsman peaks and I had heard they were hard and required some scrambling.  We were much advised not to do these mountains in the rain, but we didn’t really have a choice.  Mt. Kinsman was going to be our first introduction to what the rest of the white mountains would be like at the top; rock scrambles up and down and not to be done in the rain.
Day 49: Eliza Brook Shelter to Lincoln, NH (9 mi)
I woke up and heard the nearby brook and assumed it was raining and asked Jamie for his umbrella to go pee.  He brought to my attention hat it wasn’t raining! We had been expecting rain since midnight and throughout the morning with potential thunderstorms in the afternoon.  I was elated that it wasn’t raining, but we didn’t have service to check the weather to see any updates on when it would rain. 
Still got an early start and I was on trail by 6:30 am.  I knew South Kinsman would be a tough climb and descent, and would be an example of what is to come for the rest of the white mountains.  I was a bit traumatized from yesterday still and felt the need to cover as much easy ground as possible in case it started raining and I needed to take the hard parts extra slow.
I pushed up the early part of the climb quickly.  I felt good.  It began to get pretty technical with about 1.3 miles left to the summit.  It involved a lot of poles in one hand to better scramble.  I didn’t put them away because I was using them quite a bit as well.  I also got pretty accustomed to using the trees and roots to climb on.
Finally, I made it to the summit and we were in a total white out cloud, which was cool in its own sense, although no remarkable views (which is what this mountain is known for).  We then continued to the descent, which was also quite challenging and involved a lot of the same moves as the ascent.  
We made it all the way down with NO RAIN!  Yes!
We stopped at Lonesome Lake hut JUST as we felt a few drops fall on us and went in and asked for some water.  We ended up drinking our afternoon Soylents, Fresh Feet got a coffee, and we chatted with one of the croo members, Eddie.  He explained how the hut systems in NH work a bit more and that we would have vegan fare to look forward to at Lakes of the Cloud Hut in a few days.
As we finished our smoothies, the rain let up completely and we pushed on for the remaining 3 miles.  It was a MUCH gentler descent and easier trail than anything else we’ve had since entering NH.  Some of it was runnable!  The river crossings involved some tricky stone hopping, but I made it across with dry feet and not too much hesitation (improvement!)
We got to the interstate and had to walk 1 mile off trail on a bike path to a visitor’s center parking lot in hopes of hitching a ride into town.  We got a ride without too much waiting from a nice local couple.
We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express which felt like absolute luxury.  After we showered, we walked to The Purple Tomato (the farmer’s market store) and got delicious vegan sandwiches, kombucha and other snacks.  Headed next door to the post office and got our boxes (thank you JODI AND ERIC!  Omg yummy small amounts of dried fruit, vegan cookies, cards for each of us, and gummie bears - SO THOUGHTFUL!!) I also got a new water resovoir and hose systems or free from Hydrapak, as well as some other replacement odds and ends from Amazon.
Later we went to dinner at the Gypsy Cafe, which had an entire vegan dinner menu!  We ran into Grandma Shorty and Plod Along there. They are such a nice couple and it made us so happy to see them!  Fresh Feet and I shared the veggie potstickers, kale salad and a coconut cream linguine with tofu.  We were stuffed!  
Afterwards we went across the street to a brewery, Jamie got a beer and pretzel bites and I caught up a little on the blog (which is so hard to keep up with after such long days and such infrequent cell service these days)!  We listened to a musician play, which was a nice sound treat!","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603136,"Day 50: Lincoln, NH to Garfield Ridge Shelter (10.2 mi)
I didn’t really sleep in like I wanted, But lazed around in bed for a while.  We went downstairs to the continental breakfast and had a bagel with vegan cream cheese (I had bought some at the farmer’s market store yesterday).  Last night while doing laundry we did more of a pack shake down to make sure we weren’t carrying weight we didn’t need through the White Mountains.  We filled a box full of stuff we decided to send back to Cindy’s house to use for the second half of our trip.
It was a rainy morning so we decided to really take our time leaving so we could get on trail after the rain.  Today would be our biggest day of climbing out of Franconia Notch and up onto Franconia Ridge.  The next three days look like they will be great weather, with temps getting into the upper 80s, but the weather changes here quickly.  We lucked out majorly yesterday and avoided all the rain when it was supposed to pour on us.
The rain let up so we packed up our room quickly.  We hitched a ride with two other hikers (Hummingbird and Scrapbook), and got to the trailhead at about 10:30 am.  We still had 1 mile to hike on a blue blaze connector trail to get to the AT.
The first few miles up our ascent were wet because the rain had caused streams in the trail.  Luckily though, it was not raining on us. The climb was long.  Very long.  We messed up our routine by eating the continental breakfast instead of our breakfast smoothies so we were a little dehydrated. I was loving the feel of my brand new Hydrapak hydration system!  
We took a much needed break at the campsite at the top of the main climb and filled up with water.  We met another flip flopper, Recall, and a section hiker, both older-ish men.
We finally got to the ridge and we were in and out of cloud coverage.  The foggy summit was really cool and beautiful in its own sense.  Then the sun came out more and more and we kept getting more views all around us! It was spectacular! We were having so much fun and took a lot of pictures up on the ridge. 
The descent on the north face of Mt. Lafayette (the third and last summit of Franconia Ridge) was steep and difficult.  It lasted quite a long time also.  I slipped and fell at one point, ugh.
Then we climbed Mt. Garfield and I was able to give a strong effort up that climb.  It wasn’t too technical and I could push pretty hard up. The shelter was only about halfway down the descent, which wasn’t too technical either.  Both sides of Mt. Garfield were steep and rocky, but manageable.
When we arrived at the shelter it was a total zoo.  There was a caretaker running around and said there were 70 people tenting and sleeping in the shelter area! There was a camp group, a large group of weekend hikers as well as section and thru hikers.  We set up in the shelter and went to the food area where we made Daiya mac’n’chz (which I will be glad to never have again once off trail!).  Just as we were in the middle of trying to boil water, our fuel ran out!!  I asked if we could borrow any fuel from anyone and a weekender gave us his fuel because he was done with it and getting off trail tomorrow.  He has only boiled water in it once! What a savior!
As we were eating dinner we were sort of observing a camp group from the periphery and I had a very strong feeling that the group was from Camp Glen Brook (the Waldorf affiliated summer camp in NH I worked at from ages 18-20).  I just had a feeling.  The lingo being used was all so familiar but could very easily be any Mew England camp.  Finally, I asked if they were Camp Glen Brook and they said YES! They were the falcon group (15 year olds) and one of the girls (the one making dinner), Jera, remembered me! She was “nurse Katy’s” daughter and was 3-5 years old when I was there! She said she remembered me and that she has seen me in pictures and thought she recognized me while she was cooking beans and rice for the whole group. I couldn’t believe it! It was so fun to talk with them and see Jera as an adolescent.  It warmed my heart and filled my bucket.  
The 2 bear boxes for such a crowd were TOTALLY full, but somehow Fresh Feet fit our food in there.  The shelter was super crowded but ear plugs saved me from the snore fest. We got to bed a bit late, but great day overall! 
I LOVED the Franconia Ridge and think it is my favorite part of the AT!
Day 51: Garfield Ridge Shelter to Stealth camping at US route 302 (17.5 mi)
We got a pretty early start today, up at 5:30 and on trail by 6:30.  The very beginning of our hike was a very steep and technical downhill nicknamed “the waterfall” (for obvious reasons).  So we trudged through the waterfall/trail with soaking wet feet and I even had to sit down and use my hands to get down a section so my butt and bottom of pack got totally soaked. I just kept telling myself it was better to be wet than to slip and fall.
After the descent and some flat-ish parts we arrived at Galehead Hut and took a quick break with some other hikers.  We met another girl flip flopping named Noodle and a NoBo guy named Crockett.  
We began the very steep 1 mile climb up South Twin Mountain, but it wasn’t too technical and I could walk without using my hands most of the way.  The summit was in a cloud and the ridge walk after was pretty cloudy and rocky/swampy.  I would argue that NH has more mud than VT!
We got to Zeacliff overlook and took a quick break and checked the weather as it was our only spot for cell service for a long time.  Fresh Feet also checked his text messages as he is very anxiously/excitedly awaiting to hear from his cousins who are planning on meeting us out here (but have been pretty stealth about their plans or whereabouts). 
We descended off the ridge to Zealand Falls hut where we planned to make afternoon smoothies and take a longer break.  The descent wasn’t too tricky, but it was sort of steep and rocky and my knees were starting to hurt from all the descending.  I chatted with a very curious tourist family about what I was doing and finally got to the hut.
When I got there, Fresh Feet told me that one of his college friends, Val, had tracked us on our GPS tracker and blog and had come to the hut bearing fruit and cheer!  It was such a total surprise to see her at the hut and she had cold watermelon and strawberries which totally hit the spot! I don’t know if I’ve ever had so much watermelon in my life! It was so perfectly juicy and sweet.  It was so fun to chat with her and I couldn’t believe she was able to figure out when and where we would be so easily from tracking us, but she is from Gorham, NH, so she is quite familiar with the area.  She then offered to take out our trash, which is always such a nice treat - especially because we had the empty fuel canister and the presidential ridge tomorrow.
We left Zealand Falls Hut with full hearts and very full bellies.  To our surprise the trail was SO EASY for about 3 miles.  Totally runnable, but we were both too ful from our fruit buffet and smoothies, but we covered ground quickly.  We took a nice break with our shoes off and dried out our wrinkly feet and put on fresh socks.
Then the last two miles to Ethan Pond Shelter (where we had planned on staying) were a total swamp/marsh/wet/mud pit/boardwalk disaster.  I ended up getting both shoes/socks totally soaked. 
We got to Ethan Pond Shelter and decided we wanted to push on.  It was 5:10 pm and the terrain had been relatively easy and the weather was good, so why not make as much forward progress as possible before hitting the presidential range? At the turn off to the shelter, Jamie dropped his pack and went the quarter mile down to the shelter to check and see if his cousins were there.  I waited with the packs on trail and snacked.  He came back shaking his head and exclaiming how extra depleted he was energetically because of all the anticipation he has held all day about maybe getting to see them on trail.  Each time he heard voices or saw other hikers he wondered if it was the cousins.
We descended down 3 miles to the road where there was a stealth site right before the footbridge over a shallow river at the base of a huge mountain we have to climb tomorrow.  Jamie hiked up trail a quarter mile to a spring to fetch drinking water and I bathed and washed a few items in the river.  When he came back I made dinner while he washed up.  We had tofu scramble burritos in the rest of our tortillas on the little footbridge - the ledge was a nice bench (beats soggy log sitting by our tent).  Another hiker we have been leap frogging with, Roadkill, arrived and set up camp with us in the stealth area.  Tomorrow he will try to summit Mt. Washington because it is only 12.4 miles away and the weather looks perfectly clear for tomorrow.  The weather seems iffy the next day, so we may summit tomorrow as well if we are feeling good and making ok time.  The weather is tricky up there and can change extremely quickly, so we will need to capitalize on good weather.  Mt. Washington is famous for having the worst weather in America.  However, we don’t want to rush through the White Mountains because being up on the ridge has been both of our favorite part of the whole AT so far. 
Day 52: Stealth camping at US route 302 to Lakes of the Cloud Hut (10.5 mi)
We started the day with a big climb up Mt. Webster.  It was a bit scrambly at the top and was quite windy.  We skirted around the side of it and got some excellent views and summited Mt. Jackson, which had a large rocky outcrop area on top.  We then walked for a few miles in a very marshy area with a lot of rock hopping over mud pits and boardwalks.  We finally arrived at Mizpah Hut where we relaxed for lunch.  I was very tired and just didn’t have much energy today.
We pushed to Lakes of the Cloud Hut along a ridge and had wonderful views, not much wind at all and a lot of sun.  It was actually pretty hot and I got a little sunburned on my arms.  
Once we arrived at Lakes of the Cloud Hut we saw Sawyer and Elizabeth!!! (Jamie’s cousins, who hiked out here to hike with us for about a week or so). It was so exciting to see them! We hung out at the hut area and Fresh Feet and I were able to sign up for “work for stay.” The AMC has a program with the huts in which thru hikers help the hut croo with miscellaneous chores after they serve dinner to the guests in exchange for a floor spot in the dining room and leftover dinner.  Work-for-stay is pretty coveted and many people don’t get to do it, but I had been chatting with the previous hut croos about their vegan baked goods and they said that a croo member, Amanda, at Lakes of the Clouds Hut is vegan and she came up with some of their vegan recipes.  I made the Amanda-vegan connection upon arriving at the most popular of the huts and Amanda begged the hut master to let us stay for Work-For-Stay even though it wasn’t quite 4:00 (it was 3:54!). They let us because we bonded over being vegan, which was great because the other option was pay $10 to stay in the rat infested “dungeon” (our buddy Roadkill got there a little later and had to do that!).  Sleeping at the summit would have been very cold and windy and the only option was below the railroad tracks, which didn’t really seem like a good option.
The options for camping above tree line are pretty limited considering the weather could turn at any moment.  We are right at the base of Mt. Washington so we will summit first thing in the morning and walk along the presidential ridge, which is known to be quite technical and a lot of scrambling, but spectacular if there is good weather. Tomorrow’s forecast is calling for light rain in the morning and risk of thunder storms around 2:00 pm. Not ideal.
Leftover dinner was a lot later than we had anticipated (8:30 pm ish?) but it was absolutely delicious!  So many vegan options - thanks Amanda!
The only issue was the “work” part started at 9:00 instead of 8:00, so we weren’t finished until close to 10:00 pm.  Fresh Feet and I washed dishes.  There were 4 jobs (clean the stove, two people to wash dishes, and clean the freezer in the basement by “the dungeon.”  Work-For-Stay isn’t finished until all the jobs are done so we had to go down and help Tar with the freezer job at the end.
We set up our sleeping pads and bags on the floor of the dining room and got decent sleep considering how late we went to bed.
Day 53: Lakes of the Cloud Hut to Osgood Tentsite (10.7 mi)
We woke up in the dining room of the hut at about 5:10 am and packed up our belongings.  We left and were on trail by 6:40 am with the two cousins!  Sawyer’s trail name became “Squeeze” (like the water filter) and Elizabeth’s trail name was “El” or “Eleven” (Stranger Things reference).
The 1.4 mile rocky climb to the Mt. Washington summit was relatively easy and quick.  We had great visibility the whole way up and when we got to the summit we had the entire summit to ourselves, which is a complete rarity.  Usually the summit is full of tourists who drive up from the auto road or take the train up.  I have heard stories of long lines just to take your picture with the summit sign at the top.  We also not only had the summit to ourselves, but we had total visibility and clear skies! It was pretty remarkable because the summit of Mt. Washington is famous for being in a cloud about 362 of the 365 days of the year.  We kept saying it looked like Mordor in LOTR because the top was always in a dark cloud when we looked back at it the rest of the day, and it was a total lifeless boulder field.  We got so incredibly lucky to get up there before any clouds came in.
Mt. Washington has extremely unique weather patterns and it can be extremely dangerous.  To have good weather on the summit is almost unheard of.  We were pretty happy to start our day out this way! It was rather windy though, with the wind speed being 34 mph, so we didn’t hang out too long up there.  We needed to walk across the entire ridge, summit Mt. Madison and get down from that mountain before the thunderstorms rolled through (which was predicted to be 2:00 pm.)
The beginning of our ridge walk was so incredibly windy.  It was blowing my poles over and causing me to fall.  we endured such strong winds for an hour or two.  We looked back and the summit of Mt. Washington was already back in its cloud for the day.
We took a short break on a big rock out of the wind to eat some snacks mid morning.
We arrived at Madison hut (7 mi from Lakes of the Clouds) and we got to eat the leftover oatmeal from breakfast.  It hit the spot!  We did a little shake out of El’s backpack and redistributed some of her weight primarily to Fresh Feet.
Mt. Madison summit was only 0.5 mi from the hut, but it was PA rock jumbles all over again.  We had a total boulder field for the next 2.5 miles down Mt. Madison and along the ridge as well, so we weren’t moving too quickly.
We finally got below treelike before any weather had come in, and had a long steep descent to a campground.  We ate snacks and had smoothies and decided to push on another two miles now that the terrain was easy.  Just as we were tightening the straps of our packs we heard thunder and decided the safest and more fun thing would probably be to set up at the campsite instead of push on and get totally wet. We set up our tent on a platform for the first time and Squeeze and El set up their hammocks.  The storm blew in after we set up, so nothing got wet!!  The rain was light and didn’t last long either.
We made dinner and hung out for the evening.
Day 54: Osgood Tentsite to Pinkham Notch (4.8 mi) Near-o day
We slept in a little, it didn’t rain overnight so rain fly was totally dry by morning.  The walk to Pinkham Notch Visitor Center was SO gentle and easy compared with what we have been dealing with.  It flew by and we did it in pretty much one stretch.
We got to Squeeze’s car and had no cell service so we couldn’t load a map for directions to get to Alex Ziko’s house (friend of Jamie’s from college).  We picked a direction and headed to Gorham.  When we got there (about 35 min drive), we realized Alex’s house was the other direction!  We turned around and headed towards the tiny mountain town of Jackson, NH. 
We got to his house mid morning and he was at work, so we did all our “town chores.”  We planned out the next section (which we changed from 4 days to 5 days), showered, charged devices, hung out our tent to dry, washed camp dishes, and did laundry.  Then we went to North Conway for lunch at the Local Grocery which was DELICIOUS! It was a natural foods grocery store with a yoga studio and cafe attached.  The cafe had so many delicious vegan options! We ate a bunch and then headed to IME and EMS to look for new shoes for Fresh Feet.  Yesterday, 0.6 mi from Osgood Tentsite, he stepped on one of many jagged rocks and the bottom of his shoe broke in a way I’ve never seen before.  He called Hoka and they will replace the shoes, but he needs something in the meantime.  He finally settled on getting the Brooks Cascadia 12 trail runners (same exact shoes I am wearing).  The options were a bit limited, so this was the best he could do.
We then met up with Ziko for dinner in town at a pizza spot that had a vegan pie! Fresh Feet and I polished off a large vegan pizza and it hit the spot.  We had a good time catching up with Alex for dinner as well.
Then we headed back to Ziko’s house and did a thorough pack shake out with Elizabeth & Sawyer.  Then we got the maps out and made a plan for them so they could still hike with us, but skip the Wildcat climb and Carter Notch section.  
We visited with Alex, and went to sleep in a bed with sheets and a pillow! Yay!","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603135,"Day 55: Pinkham Notch to Stealth site N of South Carter Mountain (9.7+2 extra mi)
Woke up at Ziko’s house and ate a delicious vegan muffin and banana for breakfast. We got a bit of a later start than I wanted.  We had decided we would leave the house at 6:45 and Squeeze, El and I were totally ready to walk out the door at 6:45, but Fresh Feet needed his full morning hour plus to get ready.  I was a bit disgruntled about waiting on him for 30 mins because I’m a much slower hiker in the super technical terrain and this morning was supposed to be one of the most technical climbs.
Squeeze dropped me off at Pinkham Notch at about 7:45 am, and then Fresh Feet drooped Squeeze and El off at a nearby trailhead (so they could skip the Wildcat gnar and have a more gentle/normal hike to meet us at camp), then came back to Pinkham, parked their car there, and caught up to me on the climb up Wildcat.  
The plan was to meet up with the cousins at Imp Campsite, 13.1 mi from Pinkham Notch but a shorter hike from their trailhead (not the AT).
The climbs up Wildcat D and Wildcat Mountain were absolutely BRUTAL.  The rocks were totally wet from the rain last night, and it was a misty morning, and we were both slipping and sliding all over the place.  Fresh Feet instantly said he felt that these shoes (Brooks Cascadia) have much worse grip than the Hokas and now he can finally understand why I’m so afraid when stepping on wet rocks.  I slip almost every single time.  He took quite a few hard falls, as did I.  My falls were maybe a bit worse and more frequent. It was draining falling all the time and my body was hurting from it.  
We got to the summit of Wildcat D where there is a gondola running (from the ski resort).  It was super windy and I was getting pretty cold, so I kept moving forward. Fresh Feet caught me and we walked together for a bit. 
We got to a place that had a view and seemed like an overlook.  We weren’t convinced it was the Wildcat Mountain summit because there were no signs and it was a very small viewpoint, but we knew the summit had to be near.  We kept going, and it felt like we were descending quite a bit, so we checked Guthook to see how far we were.  It said 0.7 mi from the summit.  I kept saying, “no way! That HAS to be wrong” based on where we should have been.  It just seemed way too far away.  We kept going, Fresh Feet sped up a bit and I felt like we were going down and not up toward a summit.  I checked Guthook again and it now said 1 mi away from the summit.  We were going Southbound on the AT!!! NOOOOOO!!!! I shouted down to Jamie who didn’t believe me, but finally agreed that yes, we were somehow going the wrong way!  The overlook had been the summit and the path was pretty confusing at that spot and so after looking at the view we took the same trail we came on down 1 mile.
We were both so frustrated! Wildcat had been our toughest climb yet in terms of technicality.  It involved a lot of scrambling and was pretty scary for both of us.  This was such a big mess up.  We were averaging 1 MPH out here, barely, and to add an extra 2 hours to the day (2 miles on Wildcat), really put a dent in our plans to get to Imp campsite. It was so frustrating to have to repeat 1 mile of the same scary stuff we already had done earlier.  We were both surprised at how we didn’t recognize the trail going the other direction - it was a whole new trail when we were headed down/south/wrong way!
Once we summited the second time, we knew we only had 0.9 mi to go until the hut.  Having hoped on arriving around lunch/midday, we got there at about 2:30ish and totally demoralized.  We ate some vegan potato dill soup, vegan chocolate cake, and some leftover oatmeal from the hut and I drank a Skratch while Jamie prepared his smoothie.  I was walking outside the hut carrying both of our water bottles (which Jamie’s was open) and my crocs caught a rock and I launched forward and fell hard dropping both bottles and skidding my legs and arms (again).  All morning I had been falling, and now to fall, hard, at the hut really sent me over the edge and I burst into tears and had a good cry. 
Then we packed it up, knowing there was no way we were going to make it to Imp to see the cousins.  We had a long and steep climb out of the notch, which wasn’t too bad for me because the rocks were mostly dry and it was pretty much all walkable.  
We found a spot on Guthook that supposedly had a stealth site, so we decided to aim for that.  We arrived and found a stealth spot for our tent and made dinner and went to bed early.  We were both so incredibly beat from today.  Our stealth site was also pretty cold compared to where we normally tent (we were at higher elevation).  It is also extremely windy.  We are glad the forecast seemed clear for a few days and we had good weather again today!
Day 56: Stealth site N of South Carter Mountain to Rattle River Hostel (11.5 mi)
Today marks 8 WEEKS ON THE AT!
We got on trail a bit late but I slept a lot.  I had gone to bed with almost all of my warm clothes on, and shed my puffy jacket and buff at some point in the night.  The earplugs helped with the very loud wind.  We had a few more summits to go and then a gnarly descent down to Imp Campsite from North Carter Mountain.  It was maybe one of the tougher descents.  The rocks were slippery and it was pretty vertical most of the way down.  It involved a lot of scrambling and I even slid on my butt a few times.  
We ran into the cousins just before getting to Imp and took a break to get water and eat a bar.  
We then climbed Mt. Moriah with a lot of false summits and beautiful views. After Mt. Moriah (the last of the White Mountains), we had a verrrrry long descent.  It was steep at first and slowly became more gradual, but was killer on the knees.  Squeeze was dealing with some IT band pain and the relentless descent was no help.
We ended the day at Rattle River Hostel, I think one of the nicest hostels I’ve been to in terms of cleanliness, and we decided to call it an early day and get a much needed shower and some long rest. 
Day 57: Rattle River Hostel to Stealth tenting on NH-ME border (16.4 mi)
I woke up super early this morning and got on trail by 6:40 am.  Climbed for a few hours up to Mt. Hayes.  The view through the trees was spectacular this morning as you could see the clouds hanging over the valleys and well below the mountains.  The rocky outcrop summit and false summit were pretty and had nice views.
Mid day today Fresh Feet stopped to get some water and I pressed on.  I ended up walking with a group of 3 NoBo-ers and we got to a pond and it was incredibly confusing as to where the trail went.  There was a trail around the pond and we started to take it since it was the most obvious, but then the trail seemed to get worse.  My entire foot sunk in a mud pit - UGH.  By the time we got out the Guthook app and looked at the map and got back on trail I got super worried that Fresh Feet had passed us during that time and would still think I was ahead of him.  I pushed the pace a bit to see if I could catch him (if he happened to be in front of me).
It turns out he was still behind me (phew!) and had to run for a while to catch me.  We took a break at the Gentian shelter spur trail to have pm smoothies.  
We then had some difficult climbing to get to the next water source and we met up with a bunch of hikers there.  It was the last source for a while since the Carlo Col shelter was way off trail and a very difficult path to get there.  We then climbed Mt. Success, which was steep and slow going, but very walkable.  I didn’t mind the climb so much.  The descent looked less steep but pretty jagged on the elevation profile, but it was much more technical than the climb.  It was pretty hard for me and took us a while! We got to the NH-ME border where we set up our tent in a stealth spot with Blue Bear and Pidge.  
After eating dinner, we noticed our tent was under a dead tree that was partially fallen and was barely being held up by a very small and shaky branch.  We decided to move our tent to the trail just to be safe (and ensure an early start!)
Jamie spent a few moments memorializing his friend who took his life earlier this summer by writing a message on birch bark and looked up and saw an incredible rainbow.  It was a special moment for him.
Day 58: Stealth tenting at NH-ME border to Speck Pond Campsite (10 mi)
Woke up early-ish but later than I wanted to.  I slept pretty well because Fresh Feet and I switched sleeping pads and his air mattress pad is such a game changer! Warmer and much more comfortable (can’t feel the roots and rocks underneath like you can with my z-rest).  Now that he had a taste of what it is like to sleep on my pad he has a bit more compassion for my low quality sleep. 
We started the day right at the beginning of Maine and I got an early start (6:40 am). Maine is gnarly.  Super rugged and wild.  The trail is difficult in a whole new way out here.  There is so much boulder scrambling and the miles are slow and tough.  I think they are slower than the Whites in some cases.
We climbed multiple goose mountains which were tough because the rocks were wet and slippery from being in a cloud.  The summits were big rocky outcrops with no view because we were in a cloud.  There were lots of marshes on the tops as well.  The weather was misty and gloomy.  The clouds were dripping, but not raining, but it was enough to make the rocks slick and the mood grim.
At about 11:30 am we got to Full Goose Shelter (6 mi from the border) where we took a break and got water for smoothies before facing the Mahoosuc Notch (famous for being the hardest mile on the AT)!  We bid farewell to Blue Bear and Pidge who would surely move through the Notch faster than me.
We descended down into the Notch, which took a super long time as well because it was gnarly and steep! We took a short break before the Notch and I drank my smoothie.  We had been warned not to do the Notch in wet weather, so luckily it wasn’t exactly raining and it was now just overcast (we weren’t in a drizzly cloud because we were now at lower elevation), but it was still dark and quite overcast. Before going into the Notch we made sure to put everything inside our packs so nothing was dangling free on the outside to fall into a crevasse.  We put our poles away too.
The rocks in the Notch were mostly dry.  You could see where others had gone before because certain boulders and edges were worn away from it being the most common route.  Luckily, the Notch had arrows and blazes to help some with way finding of a good route.  Fresh Feet was having the time of his life.  I wasn’t as scared as I thought I would be, but it was just slow going.  A LOT of bouldering. 
It took us just over 2 hours to complete the Notch and now we had the Mahoosuc arm (a VERY steep climb of 1500 Feet/Mile) for 1.6 miles.  It was mostly sheer vertical slick rock slabs for the last 0.7 mi, which going down would act like a slip’n’slide today.  I was behind grateful the whole time to be going up it not down!
We were pretty exhausted when we got to the top, but had 1 mile left to the shelter.
We set up our tent on a platform, washed in the pond, had DELICIOUS ramen w tomato sauce and powdered coconut milk.  We even had dessert! (Chocolate chia and dehydrated blueberries in warm water - yum! Jamie had three tortillas full of the dessert mixture.
I was just so relieved to have the Notch behind me. Phew.  
Day 59: Speck Pond Campsite to Andover, ME hostel (15 mi)
I woke up early and hit the trail at 6:20 am.  I summited Old Speck Mountain, Which was tough, but doable and short.  Luckily it was first thing in the morning when I was feeling my freshest so it didn’t feel like a big deal.
The descent was super long but gradual and not too technical, so I finally felt like I was moving again!  It seems like it had been days since I had actually hiked on a trail with rhythm and aerobic movement. Another hiker, trail name Jesus, met up with me and we chatted during the descent making the miles fly by.  The weather today was clear and sunny, which made for better spirits and views.
At the bottom, in Grafton Notch, Fresh Feet caught up and we began our climb up Baldpate Mountain.  The first half of the mountain was my type of climbing.  Enough of a grade to work me, but not too steep.  I enjoyed the sweat and momentum.  The second half of the climb was much steeper and involved a few rock staircases.  All in all, a pretty nice climb for Maine!  The descent between the two Baldpates slowed me down a bit as it was boggy and slippery.  The second Baldpate peak was super exposed and rocky making for lots of views, cairns, and an epic summit.  It would probably be nearly impossible to summit this in the rain or if the rock slabs were wet at all.  Grateful to have good weather today! We took a break and ate some bars and fresh blueberries on the north face of Baldpate East Peak.  Then we descended to the next shelter (only 1.5 mi) to get water to make our afternoon smoothies.  The descent was a little steeper and more technical and we slowed a bit.  Filled up with water and calories and continued on our way.  Just after the Frye Notch Shelter, we climbed a small hill, Surplus Peak where I called our hostel for our shuttle, the closest place to the trail head with cell service.  
The last 4 miles down to the road were super easy and gradual.  We even did some running (which our legs are feeling now!).  There were some gorgeous waterfalls 1 mile before the road.  
We got to our hostel and opened our resupply box (THANK YOU ALLANN!) and walked to the general store/cafe for an early dinner.  They actually had veggie burgers and avocado! We also got vegan breaded mushrooms and marinara sauce.
The hostel is ok, but it isn’t really a place we want to hang out, so we will post pone our zero day a bit more (we had planned on taking a zero day here).  We are sore and tired, but forced to sleep in tomorrow as the shuttle doesn’t leave until 7:00 am to the trail head. 
Am I having a good time? I am asked this sometimes and the answer is complicated.  This isn’t a vacation.  It is a struggle. It is grueling work each and every day.  We have had three zero days this entire time, which means I am waking up at 5 am, usually sticky, muddy and gross, and then walk/climb/hop/scramble for 12-13 hours each day.  Just like with any event (marathon or bike race) it isn’t exactly “fun” when you are pushing yourself to the absolute edge, but the sense of accomplishment after such hard work leaves me with a feeling of pride. 
I am glad I am doing this trek (I think), because it is very challenging and I think there is growth in challenge, making me stronger and mentally more resilient, but I wouldn’t classify it as “fun.”  Like any practice, it is a lot of grueling work that may not be instantly gratifying.  I am living in the woods without a shower or rest, pushing myself to the edge physically, mentally, and emotionally each day, so I don’t expect to be whooping with excitement each day.  There is plenty of testosterone out here and dudes in their early 20s that are “having the time of their lives! Bagging peaks and crushing mountains man!” for which this is “easy”, but that is not my experience. I have met some women and we share the same sentiment, but they are few and far between.  
I know Maine and New Hampshire are the toughest parts of the trail, and southern Maine is particularly gnarly and wild, so it is just one day at a time out here, crushing the gnar as best we can without any major falls.","

Day 60: Andover, ME Hostel to Human Nature Hostel (10 mi)
We had originally planned for today to be a zero day, but the hostel we stayed at in Andover wasn’t the kind of place we wanted to hang out at for a day of
rest.  So we planned on hiking 15ish miles to camp, but we were moving slowly and our bodies were struggling this morning.  Our packs were heavy with our full resupply and what started out as a drizzly morning turned into a rainy blagh day.  
At some point Fresh Feet must’ve read my mind and asked if I wanted to call it at 10 mi and stop at the road and go to the Human Nature hostel we had been hearing so many wonderful things about.  I instantly nodded, yes please!
The rocks were slick and we just weren’t really feeling it.  We ran into a group of 4 NoBo hikers near a shelter and hung out for a bit with them at the shelter.  They were all slack-packing from the Human Nature hostel, a brand new hostel in the area built as a geodesic dome on 42 acres. 
The half day to the hostel turned out to be a little longer than we had hoped and we finished hiking at about 2:30 pm.  A surprise steep and long climb snuck up on us and was longer and harder than we were expecting!
We got to the road a bit before the scheduled shuttle, so we hitched into town so we could sit at the general store out of the rain.  When the hostel shuttle (a pick up truck with 8 hikers and packs in the bed) arrived we loaded up and I realized I had left my hiking poles in the previous van we had hitch-hiked in to get into town!!  Nooooo!!  I honestly didn’t know how I could continue without poles! Southern Maine was so technical and rocky and with any bit of moisture, absolutely treacherous.  I used my poles each and every step and they saved me from a lot of falls!
Upon arrival to the hostel (which was in the middle of nowhere - about a 30 Mom drive from Andover), I had service and was able to contact my dad and explained my pole sorrows.  He just so happened to have a pair of poles that were the right size and even nicer and lighter than my original ones and put them in the mail for my next mail drop.  THANK YOU DAD!!!  I still needed something for the next 4-5 days, and Fresh Feet was thinking about lending me one of his poles or I could use a good stick.  Then, we found one cheap pink hiking pole outside the hostel that needed a little TLC.  The owner said it had been there for weeks and it was mine to take.  We fixed it up with some gorilla glue and gorilla tape and now I will at least have one stand-in pole until our next resupply point. Phew!
The hostel workers cooked us all a big taco dinner with plenty of vegan options, and delicious watermelon for dessert.  Throughout the evening more hikers showed up and the hostel was totally full.  We recognized many hikers because people came from the first Andover road stop as well (so they were 10 miles behind us on trail).  Among them was a hiker we had been seeing for a while, Biscuits, but we hadn’t seen him since he got off at Rutland, VT.  He said most of his hiking buddies were a day or so behind him and he was trying to catch us because he wanted good people to summit Mt. Katahdin with.  We were honored that he was trying to catch us and excited to have a hiking buddy.  He was 10 miles behind us so it would probably take a week for him to be on schedule, so I told him we planned to be at Hostel of Maine in Stratton on Saturday and to try to make it.
We slept in the loft on a double futon with two other couples.  The bunk room was in the basement where tons of the other hikers stayed.  The building was absolutely gorgeous and I was tempted to stay here and take a zero the next day, but since we only hiked 10 miles today I felt rested enough to continue on tomorrow.  Also, knowing that the morning shuttle didn’t leave until 8:30 meant hours of sleeping in, which is my biggest treat on a zero day.
Day 61: Human Nature Hostel to Bemis Stream (12.4 mi)
I tried to sleep in as much as possible since I knew we wouldn’t be leaving the hostel until 8:30 am, but since we were in the loft space, breakfast and music and people stirring woke me up around 6.  I lazed around all morning, fully taking advantage of the late start.  Fresh Feet made vegan pancakes for us and we chatted more with other hostel guests.  One girl mentioned to someone that she was a Waldorf teacher in NH! It only took us a few minutes to discover that we had multiple mutual friends! What a small world!
Our hostel shuttle dropped a pretty sizable group of us off at the trailhead and we started to realize that we are in a hiker bubble of sorts.
The long climb up our first mountain wasn’t terrible.  But during the descent a thunder storm rolled in and it poured on us for a little while.
The next 4 mi section to the shelter was treacherous and I took it quite cautiously, letting the bubble of hikers go ahead.  I slipped and fell pretty hard and since I was using Jamie’s poles I didn’t have hands free to catch myself. It was pretty bad and I cried.  
I’m super grateful that Fresh Feet is letting me use his poles until I get my new ones because two good poles makes a big difference in this gnarly terrain.  He is using the pink one sometimes, and sometimes going no poles.
Once I got to the shelter (full of hikers) I realized everyone else had taken a pretty bad fall during that stretch as well.  Fresh Feet fell a few times pretty badly. It was a tough section. I ate two bars and drank some electrolytes and pressed on.  4 more miles to the stream with a lot of unofficial camping spots.
A pretty big group of us camped at the stream.  We had our first legitimate run in with mosquitoes and we lit some incense while making dinner and that seemed to help significantly.
Day 62: Bemis Stream stealth camp to Eddy Pond stealth camp  (17.7 mi)
We had pretty loud and hard thunderstorms last night and it soaked one of my shoes and the bottom of Fresh Feet’s pack, but otherwise we fared pretty well! Fresh Feet was pretty concerned about our food bags because he didn’t roll his up very much (and we are still hanging them albeit for rodents more than bears in this region), but everything inside our bags was dry.  A wet tent and rainfly usually sends Fresh Feet into meltdown mode, but he knew we would have opportunities to hang it and dry it in the sun during the day, so we packed up and left.
We started our day by fording Bemis Stream and we both wished we had forded last night and camped on the north side so we didn’t have to start out with cold, wet feet.  Oh well. 
The hiking today was muddy.  Boggy, marshy, wet and muddy.  The mud pits really slow me down because I really refuse to dunk my feet into the stink pit (which can sometimes be knee or even waist deep!).  The big stench left in our socks from a bad big sink is like no other and impossible to get out.  That smell is in a class of its own and I can’t take it anymore, so I just go much slower than most other hikers around the mud fest.  We didn’t have much scrambling today, but the slippery roots and slippery mud provided it’s own obstacle course.  
Many of the other hikers headed into Rangeley, ME for a resupply but since we didn’t need it we pressed on another 4 mi past the road and stealth camped by a beautiful pond at the base of the Saddleback Mountains.  Tomorrow’s forecast has rain and the summits and ridge is above tree line so we would like to get up and over them as early as possible tomorrow.
We ate couscous and a cheesy nutritional yeast mixture for dinner and it was WAY too much couscous.  Fresh Feet bagged the leftovers into a ziplock for tomorrow because we just couldn’t finish it.
We were both pretty tired today because the storm kept us up last night and our bodies haven’t had a day of rest in 23 days and we felt it.  Especially with all the falling in the last few weeks.
Day 63: Eddy Pond Stealth camp to  Spaulding Mountain Shelter (15 mi)
We got an early start today because we were both pretty cold this morning. Waking up to see the beautiful mist on the pond was stunning.  I hung out for a bit to see if I could spot a moose, but no luck.
I was on trail by 6:30 am and started the climb up Saddleback mountain.  It wasn’t a bad climb, but it was slow.  Toward the top we got above tree line and there were a lot of false summits and absolutely gorgeous views!  The clouds hung low over the valleys and having the entire peak to myself was special.  Fresh Feet caught me on the descent, which was also exposed so you could see where you were going and everything behind us.  We really enjoyed being up there! The descent from the horn (second peak of the day) was long and hard and we took a break before beginning the next summit, Saddleback Junior.  Of the three above tree line summits today, I found this one to be the trickiest/most challenging.  
After Saddleback Jr we took a lunch break at a shelter and pressed on.  We had a very long descent and climb still ahead of us, but we were glad to have the exposed mountains behind us before any rain came.  The forecast now said 6:00 pm rain continuing throughout the night and all day tomorrow.  Just after leaving the shelter we saw two couples heading SoBo (Smiley & Honey badger and Baba Ganoush and Red Stripe).  We knew them all as NoBo-ers but they all decided to “slack-pack” this section in the SoBo direction.  Slack-packing is when you take a day pack and a hostel or friend drives all the rest of your gear to your end point for the day.  They are all pretty worn out and ready to be done (as is the case with most of the NoBos that started in Georgia at this point), so they are using the slack-packing services more frequently.
We descended and then took another break at the creek at the bottom. We washed our feet and dried out our bog socks.  Then we began to climb.  We had about 3 miles of climbing and then 2.2 more mellow seeming terrain to the shelter.  The first half of the climb wasn’t bad at all. The trail was easy going and smooth!  It wasn’t even very steep! It was nice to get some aerobic work while pushing the climb.  The last bit was much steeper and more technical, but still didn’t involve rock climbing or scrambling, so yay!
We took a much needed break at the top and only had 2.2 more miles until the shelter.  Fresh Feet informed me that the forecast predicted rain would begin in 45 minutes.  At the pace we’ve been going I knew it would be difficult to beat the rain.  I looked at the elevation profile and saw that it looked flat and jagged, which we both thought would be super boggy, which is slow going.  Just as we got started the slightest drizzle of rain began.  It wasn’t enough to get me wet, but I noticed it and could tell it could pick up and turn into real rain at any moment.  Luckily, the trail was easy going and smooth! Hallelujah! We did some running and I made it to the shelter JUST in time before the rain picked up.
We had basil walnut penne for dinner (one of our favorites!) and laid down for an early night.  Our plan was to head into town tomorrow, but if it rains all day we may post pone and wait it out in the shelter as there are some steep rock scrambles on the map for tomorrow that would be pretty awful to do in the rain.
Day 64: Spaulding Mountain Shelter to Hostel of Maine in Stratton (13.5 mi)
It absolutely POURED early this morning.  A few huge thunderstorms rolled through while we were waking up in the shelter.  We were glad we slept in the shelter last night and not our tent, because the rain was coming down HARD.  We waited it out for a while, debating if maybe we should just take the day off in the shelter, just as it began to clear up.  The forecast still said 45% change of T-storms in the afternoon (when we would be summiting the rocky Crocker mountains), but they aren’t exposed like the saddlebacks are so we decided to go for it.
We hit the trail at about 8:00 am and stayed together most of the day.  The conditions were pretty terrible all day because of the rain.  The trail was a swamp and the boggy parts turned into swimming holes.  We kept trying to go around the wettest and muddiest parts, but there was no avoiding it completely.  We had very wet feet and were VERY muddy all over.
We had a big descent down to a rushing stream that involved a little bit of scrambling and the wet rocks made for an extra slippery situation. The stream was totally flooded but there was still a rock hopping option with a pretty sketchy plank and looked pretty scary considering how flooded and fast the water was moving! I crossed without my pack and let the Fresh Feet carry it across.
We then started the 3.1 mi climb up the first Crocker Mountain.  It was ok grade, very rocky, but no scrambling involved.  There was a 0.5 mi section in the middle that was incredibly steep, but other than that it was just a long and slow climb.
We then had a short descent in between peaks, summited North Crocker and then had an “easy 5 miles” down to the road.  This 5 mile section should have been faster and easier, but the boggy, swampy, wet rock conditions made it slow going today.
The shuttle for Hostel of Maine picked us up and we arrived at the most beautiful enormous log cabin style hostel.  Our room was like a deluxe hotel room, but the services were laid back and hiker friendly like a hostel.  The place was SO NICE! Breakfast was included (with plenty of vegan options), they had a store with tons of hiker resupply items (which we got a few things and even traded some of our Probars for some other types of bars), and they did our laundry for us.  We seriously considered staying here an extra day and taking a zero day because the hostel was so nice but the weather looked great for the next day so we decided to keep hiking.  In order to maximize rest, we agreed to take the later shuttle at 9:30 to the trailhead instead of the 7:30 shuttle.
We showered, put on loaner clothes from the hostel, and walked just next door to a good Italian restaurant, Hugs.  Jamie had been here many times before when he would come up to Maine to ski Sugarloaf Mountain, so he was excited to get to eat here again and shared many memories of the area.
When we got back to the hostel, more hikers showed up.  The two couples (Smiles & Honey Badger and Baba Ganoush & Red Stripe) and our buddy Biscuits caught us!  He was tired but eager to hike with us and very glad about the late shuttle plan for the morning.
Day 65: Hostel of Maine in Stratton to Stealth camping on Little Bigelow (12.8 mi)
We had a leisurely morning in our beautiful hostel and ate a very substantial breakfast.  I had freshly baked vegan bread with Earth Balance butter and raspberry preserves with homemade muesli with banana and almond milk - what a feast!!!
The shuttle was supposed to take us to the trailhead at 9:30, but ended up leaving at 10:00.  I got on the first carload and Fresh Feet and Biscuits made it on the 3rd/last carload (so probably more like 10:30 am).  We had three big summits today, the Bigelows, which would mark the end of the rugged southern Maine gnar.  
On the way up, I met Pappy, who is hiking the trail as an 87 yer old! He is doing it with his granddaughter and another hiker who just wants to help him out.  It was pretty inspiring! 
I hiked up for a while solo and then the rest of the way to Horns Pond lean-to with Red Stripe who is a 31 year old woman! She started in Georgia and is NoBo and said I’m one of two women in her 30s she has met on the trail.  She is my first and only 30-something female companion.  It was so nice to be around someone in my demographic because I feel like we are having similar experiences in many ways and can relate to each other.
Fresh Feet finally caught up while we were waiting for him at the lean-to and we pressed on.  Not long after, Biscuits arrived and we summited the Bigelows, one at a time.  In between the last two, Fresh Feet fell a few times and scraped up his arm and leg.  Now we have matching battle wounds.
In between the main Bigelows and the Little Bigelow there was a deep col and there were house-sized boulders and caves that were SO NEAT!
We finished out the day stealth camping with Biscuits on the top of Little Bigelow.  Red stripe and the other 3 were all slack packing and did 16 miles today.  We had a nice time hanging out with Biscuits and enjoyed the sunset from the top of Little Bigelow mountain.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603133,"Day 66: Stealth camping on Little Bigelow to Pierce Pond Lean-To (20.2 mi)
Today was a great day, but it was long.  We walked along so many ponds (which are more like lakes) and leap frogged with two other couples (Smiles & Honey Badger and Red Stripe & Baba Ganoush) and Biscuits.  We had lunch on a dock with Biscuits at about 12:40 and then 4 mi later there was a tiny sandy beach where we all 7 hung out and swam (the two couples, us, and Biscuits).  
The stretch of trail from lunch to the beach was especially boggy for about 2.5 miles and I started to feel so sleepy and tired.  Taking a dip at that sandy beach and drinking some Nuun gave me a second wind for the final 6.3 mi to the shelter.
I left the beach before everyone else and started hiking.  The trail was fantastic! It was piney and smooth (what we call “Hollywood trail”) with only a few patches of bog/mud/swamp.  This allowed for a little bit of running in small bursts during the slightly downhill sections of the smooth trail.  
Today was mostly FLAT! We are finished with the hard stuff of southern Maine now that we have the Bigelow mountains behind us.  I’m sure we will still have our challenges, but we had great weather, flat terrain for the most part and a lot of smooth trail and pretty ponds.  Good company helps as well!
 
Got to the lean-to and set up our tent with a beautiful view of the lake.  We ate dinner with Biscuits and watched the sunset over the lake while listening to the loons.  Our quinoa meal wasn’t quite filling enough so I ate a tortilla with some peanut butter from Biscuits which hit the spot.  He also let me borrow his extra z-rest sleeping pad again which helps tremendously with warmth and comfort. He sleeps in a hammock so he only uses the pad for shelters or sitting on at camp.  Double sleeping pad has been a nice game changer in quality of life!
Day 67: Pierce Pond Lean-To to Stealth camp by Moxie Pond Road (16.1 mi)
We slept in! It was Kennebec river day, which means you have to take a ferry across a large river.  The ferry only runs from 9 am - 2 pm.  Since we only had a 4 mile hike from our camp to the ferry, we took our time leaving camp this morning to get there in the neighborhood of 9 am.
Upon arrival to the river, the ferryman asked us if anything unusual happened to us last night.  We said “no, why?” He said there was a man at large who swam across the river and asked a guy stealth camping on the bank of the river if he had an extra pair of shoes or a shirt. They think he probably used the trail and headed south.  He asked if we heard the helicopters looking for him all night.  We did not.
We took the “ferry” (a canoe) across and I even got a ferrymen’s blessing for tipping the ferryman.  He drew us a map in the dirt with a stick for how to get to the Caratunk House and we walked the 5 minutes to the B&B.  They had a very nice hiker resupply and we all three got snacks and something to eat then.  I ate double oatmeal and Fresh Feet had double veggie burger.  As we were sitting outside on the picnic table eating I got absolutely DEVOURED by no-see-ums.  They left itchy welts all over my thighs and I had to leave and start hiking.
Then we hiked another 6ish miles to a shelter and I felt as though I was sleep waking.  Fresh Feet suggested I take a dip in a nice stream and I did.  It helped some, but I felt so sleepy tired this afternoon. It might have been the heat?
We then climbed a small mountain which was a nice change in pace from all of the more flat sections we have been walking recently.  I enjoyed climbing and then getting the views after. I felt like there was a sense of accomplishment.
The descent was long and seemed to drag on forever, however.
Finally we made it to a stream where Biscuits and Fresh Feet filled up with water and I pushed on to find a stealth spot.  On the way we passed by Moxie Pond on a short road walk section and there was a small dock and I washed off at the dock.  Then we had a river ford and it was slightly scary, but I made it after some backtracking.  I found a stealth spot and we set up camp and ate dinner when Smiles and Honey badger also showed up to stealth camp with us.  I turned in early because of how tired I was today, hoping to get more sleep tonight before our supposedly very rainy day tomorrow.  
Day 68: Stealth camp by Moxie Pond Road to Stealth camp by E Branch Piscataquis River (18 mi)
I had a pretty hard time sleeping because my no-see-um bites began to itch uncontrollably all at once.  It was awful and I couldn’t help but scratch them because I was partly asleep.
We expected today to be pouring rain on us all day, but we got lucky! We had some drizzle, to sprinkle, to light rain, to only “tree rain” throughout the day, which kept the trail nicer.  We were wet, our feet were very wet, but at least we didn’t have a giant puddle to walk in the entire day.
We started out the morning with a big climb up Moxie Bald Mountain.  If we hadn’t been in a rain cloud, being on top of this bald summit provides some of the best views of the region.  We had a misty and very windy and cold summit so we didn’t hang out on top at all.
We descended and arrived to a lean-to, but it was only 11:00 am and felt too early for our pm smoothies, so we took a quick break with Smiles, Honey Badger and Biscuits and then pressed on.  About 4 miles later we decided to use up the water in our reservoirs to make our smoothies because there weren’t any good water sources around.  The spring we were counting on did not look good.
We continued on another 5 miles to the next lean-to where we initially planned on ending our day.  The first 2 miles were easy breezy and I ran most of it.  Then we got to the biggest mud pit of the day and my foot went in above the ankle. Ugh.  About 5 minutes later there was a river ford with a big rope across and I decided to just go with socks and shoes on, in hopes it would clean out some of the bog mud stink from my socks and shoes.
The next 3 miles were pretty easy regarding elevation, but the trail was rooty, rocky and slippy.  I got to the lean-to and it was 3:45.  Too early to call it a day.  While taking a break and changing socks I got absolutely attacked by no-see-ums AGAIN!  It felt like sharp shards of glass piercing/stinging me invisibly and and I felt like there was nothing I could do about it!
We pushed on two more miles, forded another river and decided to set up camp just on the other side of the river.  The mosquitos and no-see-ums were really bad, so Fresh Feet put all of his energy into building a fire.  We had some time since we got to camp around 5:00, which felt early.  I set up the tent, filtered water and made dinner.  Just as I was making dinner, Biscuits showed up and joined us while we ate a LOT of beans, rice, pumpkin seeds wrapped in tortillas.  I felt really full after dinner which is getting more rare these days.  The smoke from the wet fire did help deter the bugs and made being outside bearable.  
However, once I got into the tent, the bites from the previous days and today were itching so badly and combined with the wool leggings I was wearing (which I think I sometimes have a skin sensitivity to), I started to break out into hives on my legs. I took a Benadryl and it helped until about 3:00 am.  I didn’t get too much sleep and was pretty itchy and miserable! 
Day 69: Stealth camp by E Branch Piscataquis River to Monson, ME (6.7 mi)
The terrain was smooth sailing this morning and we made great time getting into Monson.  I knew we would be meeting up with friends (James and Rachel Madsen), but didn’t have cell service to contact them for a lot of the walk into town.  I basically didn’t stop the whole way except to pee.  The no-see-ums devoured me if I stopped or slowed and it was becoming intolerable.  
When we got to hwy 15, we met James and Rachel in the parking lot and they drove us and Biscuits into the small town of Monson, ME.  They immediately greeted us with vegan baked goods which absolutely hit the spot! What a treat! We then checked in to our hostel, got laundry started, took showers, washed our dishes, set out our wet tent to dry and opened our resupply box (THANK YOU JOSH AND PRISCILLA!!).  Josh put some delicious homemade granola in the box for us and the Madsen’s brought us vegan yogurt, so we feasted on granola and yogurt while we waited for our laundry.  Josh ALSO put in enough tortillas to get half the hostel through the hundred mile wilderness - clearly he has twins at home! Our resupply was a big one.  We planned to carry 8 days for the next 120 miles, which is pretty heavy and adds up quickly.
The Madsen’s treated us to a delicious lunch where we ate so much and filled our bellies with real food and our hearts with real conversation.  It was such a treat to get to be spoiled by the Madsen trail angel duo in one of the most remote sections of the trail (and country!).  
We then stopped by the AT info center and got all the info we needed about Baxter State Park and our summit date.  Baxter is extremely strict about a lot of things and our mount Katahdin summit will fall on Labor Day weekend, so it may be crowded and difficult to make everything work as it should in the next 8 days.
When we got back to Shaw’s (our AT hostel), I rested for quite a while.  Caught up with my family some (although cell coverage was so spotty!) and caught up on the blog a little.  
My headband never made it back from the laundry (grumble grumble), but we got coordinating southwestern bandanas at the gear shop at Shaw’s for Biscuits, Fresh Feet and myself.  One of the hostel workers, Levar (“Fish”) went to the Austin Waldorf School and his sister and my sister know each other! Such a small world!  He hiked the trail last year and is working up here at the hostel for the season with plans to do the John Muir trail next.  What a fun connection.
We ate loaded vegan bagel sandwiches at the deli in the general store and went to bed.  I covered myself in tiger balm hoping for some itch relief, and got some, but didn’t have a great night’s sleep due to the systemic histamine surge my body is fighting from all the bites from the last few days. My Sjögren’s disease can make my body have intense flare ups and skin reactions with regards to histamine seems to be one of my symptoms. Ugh.
The 100 mile wilderness awaits us in the morning.  We will have the heaviest packs yet (the most we’ve carried has been 6 days) because we plan to go at a comfortable pace (some people just crush 25 mi days to not have to carry as much food).  Since we still haven’t had a zero since VT, we are tired and will try to average 16-17 mi/day.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603132,"Day 70: Shaw’s Hiker Hostel, Monson ME to stealth camp at Long Pond Stream (14.4 mi)
We woke up leisurely (in the neighborhood of 5:30 am), but I didn’t sleep too well due to the insane itch all over my legs from the no-see-um bites.  
Breakfast was at 7:00 and was a total feast! I had some more yogurt that the Madsens brought us yesterday with the granola Josh made us and put in our resupply box (so yummy!). The hostel staff made us vegan home fries and all-you-can-eat vegan blueberry pancakes and we were both so full after breakfast it was hard to think about hiking.  Any weight lost (which at this point we both felt that perhaps we had lost a few pounds) was definitely gained back from this incredible breakfast.
The first shuttle left at 8:00 and Fresh Feet and I got on it (Biscuits got on the 2nd shuttle).  
Poet, the owner of the hostel and former thru hiker, left us with some encouraging words, thoughts and terrain tips as we entered the 100 mile wilderness.  This 100 mile stretch is barren of any amenities or towns on trail and is the last stretch before arriving at Baxter State Park (where we would summit Mt. Katahdin, the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail).  There is one very bleak convenient store and restaurant at Abol Bridge, which marks the northern end of the 100 mile wilderness and the border of Baxter where hikers look forward to a taste of civilization and some food options at the attached restaurant.
We entered the 100 mile wilderness with a 6 day plan, then two days in Baxter state Park.  This meant leaving Monson with 8 days of food (with some security of knowing we could get something at Abol Bridge if needed).  Our heaviest resupplies had only been 5-6 days prior, and we definitely could feel the additional weight of carrying 8 days of food.  Most hikers resupply at gas stations and hop into towns more frequently because they don’t rely so heavily on their resupply boxes, so they are accustomed to only carrying about 2-3 days worth of food.  Needless to say, the heavy pack weight of the 100 mile wilderness was something we all had to grapple with.  Some thru hikers are so ready to be done at this point that they do the 100 mile wilderness in 4-5 days so they don’t have to carry as much food, but we were tired and ok with keeping a reasonable pace to feel a little more relaxed and comfortable.  Not to mention, the 10 day forecast looked great for an August 31 summit up Katahdin so we began to zero in on the idea of an 8/31 summit date, which left us a bit of wiggle room for enjoyment or “just-in-cases.”
We stepped out of the shuttle, and began putting one foot in front of the other, as we have done for so many days prior. The terrain was more difficult than yesterday in terms of technicality and slippery obstacles, but not as difficult as Southern Maine.
We moved slowly because our pack weight for the next 8 days/120 miles to the end was an adjustment and loaded us down. 
After about 6.6 miles we got to some epic water falls in a slate canyon.  The slate made so many rectangular shapes that the rock formations of the waterfall looked almost man-made! It was beautiful! I enjoyed my smoothie with a group of hikers hanging out on the rocks in the middle of the river at the top of the falls.  There were no bugs in the middle of the fast moving water, so it was a nice spot to take a break.
We had two river fords where it was necessary to take off shoes and the water was about shin to knee deep and the rocks were quite slippery!  Fresh Feet tried to rock hop the second river ford but ended up soaking his shoes instead.
After fording the second river we looked for stealth spots and found some great ones right along the river.  The boys were ready to call it a day before getting to the shelter (1 more mile), so we made dinner and set up camp for the evening at a picturesque open piney camping area on the banks of a strongly flowing river.  
The mosquitoes were pretty bad all day long, but I wore pants which helped and we lit incense at camp which made a big difference as well.
Day 71: Stealth camp at Long Pond Stream to Stealth camp at Pleasant River (16 mi)
Phew.  Today was long and tough. It was an 11 hour day with a LOT of elevation and very heavy packs. 
I took a Benadryl last night because the leg itch was out of control.  I was super sound asleep and groggy when I woke up at 6:45 am.  I tried to get ready quickly and get on trail because I knew we would have a LOT of mountain peaks today, which naturally slows my pace, but makes for a more interesting hike.
We had to climb up Barren Mountain, which consisted of two sustained climbs.  Then we had four Chairback peaks and a half peak in between the fourth and third Chairback.  It was hot, buggy, humid, and tough climbing.  Our views were pretty bad because there was so much humidity that the horizon was quite hazy.
It was a rough trail.  Very rocky, rooty, some serious rock scrambling down Chairback (the last peak in the NoBo direction).  It was just rugged and gnarly. Fresh Feet had a few bad falls and one where he fell and his mouth was an inch from a rock. Scary!
Just as I was finishing the descent off the mountain range, Baba Ganoush caught me and we walked the last mile together.  Biscuits was right behind.  Fresh Feet had already set up our tent when we all three arrived to the stealth spot on the river.  Red Stripe and Baba Ganoush had hiked 20 miles today, Wow!  They are wanting to summit a day earlier than us, so will have to have longer days than us through the 100 mile wilderness.
I made tofu scramble and we ate it in our tortillas.  We waited for Red Stripe and she finally arrived at 8:30 in the dark! Yay!  What a tough and very long day for her, ooof!
Day 72: Stealth at Pleasant River to East Branch Lean-to (16.4 mi)
Last night I felt something rubbing on my body from outside the tent.  I was having such a deep sleep that for a split second I thought it was my orange kitty.  Then I woke up and realized, nope! Not in my bed at home, still in the woods and I leapt onto Jamie freaking out and shrieking “GET IT OUT OF HERE!”  I still had no idea what was going on, but knew an animal was in the vestibule of my tent and had been RUBBING ON MY BODY THROUGH THE TENT! Ewwwwwww!!!!
He turned on his headlamp and shone it on the mystery animal and realized it was a skunk checking out my backpack and then casually hobbled out of the vestibule when the light shone on him.  
I was so thoroughly awake and freaked out so I got out of the tent to pee and instantly found Mr. Skunk.  I shone my headlamp on him pacing beneath our food bags which were hung, hardly, from a small line only inches from the ground. He had already destroyed an empty soylent ziplock baggie that Fresh Feet accidentally left out.
I asked Jamie to rehang the bags and include our backpacks in the hang.  We realized that I had accidentally left my Soylent water bottle (empty) in the side of my pack instead of hanging it with the rest of our food, which is probably what he smelled on my pack.
How we didn’t get sprayed is a total mystery! We were SO lucky! We weren’t exactly being quiet, as we were both so tired and freaked out.  I consider our skunk encounter such a close call! It would have been a miserable 7 more days if all our gear had been sprayed by Mr. Skunky!  Wow.
Morning rolled around and our food and packs were fine, phew.  Red Stripe was explaining that she had to leave behind all of her shorts and pants in Monson because they had torn so many holes in the butt from sliding on rocks in rock scrambles. This is something other women have had issues with as well, and I try to avoid sliding when I can because of this risk, but sometimes a butt slide is the only way.  There was absolutely no place to buy any sort of apparel in Monson, so Hippy Chic, Poet’s wife and owner of Shaw’s hostel in Monson, sold Red Stripe a pair of her own shorts.  They had a draw string, and were made of a sturdy enough material to withstand rock sliding, but were falling off of Red Stripe’s slender frame.  They were just WAY too big!  I had a second pair of shorts that I stopped using when I switched to my spandex shorts (because I didn’t feel like I had good range of motion for more technical moves in them) so I gave my Nike baggie shorts to Red Stripe and they worked out perfectly for her. 
Our morning started off with a river ford.  We then had 5.6 miles of very gradual climbing.  Then we shot up and had four mountain summits.  The first one, Gulf Hagas, was the most difficult for me.  We took our lunch break at a beautiful campsite in between two of the peaks and got fresh mountain spring water for our smoothies and resovoirs.
Then we knocked out peaks 2-4 in one swoop.  Biscuits, Fresh Feet and I summited the final peak together, White Cap Mountain, which was our first mountain with a view today and we also got our first glimpse of mount Katahdin. The humidity was so intense that it was quite hazy and the view wasn’t great, but it was exciting nonetheless.
The climbing today was relentless, but much tamer trails and not so technical, which was nice.  We took a break on our way down from White Cap at Logan Shelter where I got some cell service for the first time in days (didn’t even really have service in Monson!).  I worked with my dad on flights and a hostel room for the night after our Katahdin summit in Millinocket now hat we had picked a summit date. Thank you Dad for helping us get those logistics figured out!
Then smooth sailing downhill to our campsite at the shelter.  We camped with Red Stripe, Baba Ganoush and Biscuits and enjoyed good company and dinner together.
Day 73: East Branch Lean-to to Stealth Camp on Sandy Beach on Mary-Jo Lake (17.8 mi)
Ooof - we had such a humid morning today.  We started out with a double climb up a little mountain, and I was dripping in sweat.  I was looking forward to a swim so badly.  The water sources the previous two days were scarce because we were on mountain ridges, so I haven’t really been able to swim or wash my body since Monson.  I felt so dirty and grimy from the sticky humid air, the grease from putting tiger balm on my bites, combined with sweat and dirt.  You know it’s bad when your elbow creases are brown with dirt.  Ugh.
The pond in between the two climbs looked pretty boggy and not like a good place to swim, so I looked on Guthook (app) and saw a sandy beach at the bottom of the descent from the mountain.  I told the boys I wanted to swim there so we met up there for a morning swim and snack.
Then we pushed on, flat nice trail 3.5 mi to a shelter with beautiful swimming pools and a cascading waterfall for lunch.  I soaked my feet and legs, Fresh Feet got all the way in and we had our soylent smoothies.
We had another 8 miles of flat Hollywood trail to get to Antler’s Campsite.  I didn’t stop the whole way as it was quite buggy.  When I got to Antler’s Campsite (one of the favorite campsites of the AT), Fresh Feet had picked out a wonderful tent spot on a little peninsula for us.  It seemed dreamy.  We hung out with Red Stripe and Baba Ganoush probably for the last time because they were going to hike 11 more miles to try and make their 8/30 summit.  We bid them farewell and congratulated them.  Then we decided that since it was only 3:00 pm to push an extra 2 miles to a sandy beach on the same lake.  It was not an easy decision because the camping at Antlers was pretty nice looking!
We got to our beach early, before 4:00, so plenty of daylight still. The sun, no shade, and humidity was brutally hot.  We swam multiple times in the lake/pond to cool off while we set up camp.  The sunset and view was spectacular, but the flies & later mosquitoes and beating sun made it kind of difficult camping conditions.  I had to take a Benadryl this evening because the histamine surges were out of control from all the bites.
We retired to our tent early and Fresh Feet told me how proud he is of me.  Then we heard some pretty magical loon sounds.  
Day 74: Sandy Beach on Mary-Jo Lake to Rainbow Stream Lean-to (20 mi)
Woke up early this morning and started hiking at about 6:45 am. Fresh Feet caught me at about 6 miles and we took a break and ate a morning bar. Just after we left, I slipped on a rock in a mud pit and fell and smashed my knee into another rock.  I couldn’t lift myself up because of my pack weight, but luckily Fresh Feet was right there and he pulled me out so I could take my pack off.  I burst into tears and felt nauseous.  
I am so sick of falling.  It really changes my mood and makes it difficult to bounce back into a rhythm.  I put on music to try and get me going again and it helped some, but my knee was aching, I had a weird shooting pain every now and again up the side of my leg, and mostly, I was just shaken up from the mud pit slip/fall.  Ugh.  I really feel like I’m over it.  I’m just 100% done with the falling.  My body can’t take the shock from it anymore.  It feels traumatic and extra difficult to catch yourself with poles in hand and a heavy pack on your back pushing you into the ground once you begin to slip.  
About 1 mile later we reached our 1,000th mile hiked! We stopped and made a stick mile marker for ourselves (something that is done usually for the standard mile markers for the NoBos, but since we didn’t start in GA, we had to make our own).
I was still in a bit of a slump from my fall so I continued to listen to some music.
After that we hiked for another hour and a half before stopping at the last stream for a while.  We made our afternoon smoothies there and then continued.  The day was getting pretty hot.  I stopped briefly at the next shelter where Fresh Feet was writing in the trail log and looked at the thermometer and it said 85 degrees.  With the insane humidity and the fact that I’m wearing thick wool socks and pants (as bug and itch prevention), I was starting to really feel the effects of the heat and humidity.
We had a small mountain to climb (about 1.5 miles of pretty steep climbing).  Should have been no big deal, but I started to really drag on the climb.  The terrain waffled between stone staircase, to rocky, rooty, muddy mess.  No scrambling, but it was a tough climb.  My body really heated up during the climb and it slowed me down and made me extra tired.  When I got to the top I had to take a break to cool off and bring my heart rate down.  I ate a bar and drank some water.  
I finally felt like hiking again, but about 0.5 mi down I was just feeling way too hot again.  I stopped and took off my pack and fished around for my shorts (which took me a WHILE to find.  I gave my feet a break from the wool suffocation and changed into my shorts.  The bugs weren’t that bad, but I stashed my pants in my side picked for easy access in case the itching became unbearable again.  Sometimes just the grass blades and underbrush touching my bare legs activates the itch cascade which is why the pants seemed to really help with the itching.
I felt MUCH better in shorts.  I ate some cliff chews and knew there was a pond in 1.5 mi of mostly gentle downhill.  When I got to the pond I stopped to really think about if I wanted to get in.  It seemed a little grassy and dirty.  But I was so hot.  Then I saw Fresh Feet sitting in the shade waiting for me. He encouraged me to get in if I was feeling so hot.  I took a quick dip and it revived me.
We had about 2.5 miles left until a cascading waterfall and stream where there would be better swimming and we could refill with water.  
When I got to the waterfall pools I stopped at one of the first ones. No one was there, which was perfect! I had it all to myself for a nice cold swim.  It really cooled me down.  I could also tell that the caffeine from my previous bar was starting to kick in and I was feeling a lot better.
We then only had 1.8 miles to the shelter where there was a nice open pine area with tons of tent sites.  I pushed hard the last bit.  It seemed to drag on longer than I wanted.  Right as I was arriving to the shelter I heard thunder.  I looked up and the clouds were quite dark.  I changed and waited for Fresh Feet and Biscuits to arrive.  Fresh Feet still wanted to set up the tent even if it rained because of the bugs. I agreed.  
We set up quickly and got all of our stuff in the tent/vestibule and made dinner under Biscuit’s hammock tarp. It rained ever so slightly, and then let up.  Kind of a bummer because the humid air was still hanging around.
Day 75: Rainbow Stream Lean-to to Abol Campground (15 mi)
We slept in a little today and I hit the trail by 7:15 am.  It was a super warm and humid night.  We had the rain fly half off because it did rain a tiny bit when we got to the shelter yesterday, but it was too hot to have it on.  It was the first night all trip I didn’t even take my sleeping bag out of its sack.  I used it under my knees and that felt nice. Stone and I shared his light 45 degree bag here and there throughout the night.
I had a hard time finding my rhythm this morning.  The first 3 miles or so were super rocky, rooty, and muddy in an annoying way.  It was flat, but just tricky footing that slowed me down.
Fresh Feet and I took a short break at a lake and happened to see a seaplane land in the water! Cool!  
Then we had our short and gradual climb for the day up Rainbow Mountain.  
We stopped at the stream 2.5 mi down from the mountain at a brook right outside of a shelter where we drank our afternoon smoothies and I soaked my feet - it has been SO HOT AND HUMID!
Then we crushed the last 4 miles to the end of the 100 mile wilderness on mostly smooth Hollywood trail.
The boys were in front of me and had set up camp at Abol’s Campground and I went and took a half shower (hot water but no soap or shampoo/conditioner).
At about 3:00 we went to the restaurant where Fresh Feet got a Veggie burger and I ate some fries and some nuts and dried fruit from the attached convenient store.  I wasn’t that hungry (it was 3:00).
I stayed in the restaurant and paid for crappy WiFi (which only allowed for texting) and charged up my phone.
The craziest weather blew in.  Suddenly hurricane-like winds and a torrential downpour completely washed over the entire campground.  I was in the middle of making dinner at our campsite and we ran to the restaurant to take cover but I got completely soaked in doing so.  The waitress was really nice and let us eat our vegan camp dinner in there and we ordered a salad.
We came back to assess the damage and for the most part our stuff was dry.  Fresh Feet’s pack got a little wet, the clothing I was wearing was soaked, but the tent held up well in the storm.
I got in the tent for the night and the rain picked back up and there seemed to be some seeping at the seams of the rainfly because there was some dripping from the rainfly to the tent screen down into the inside of the tent.  The dripping is minimal and it can hopefully all dry out tomorrow because it is scorching in the sun!
Tomorrow we have to be up VERY early to make sure our names are on the list of 12 spots to stay at the northernmost shelter on the AT, The Birches. The shelter is in Baxter State Park, which is a very rigid and rule heavy park, creating some obstacles for thru hikers (like the early morning race to the kiosk 1 mile into the park the day you want to stay at the Birches).  Our campground fee included breakfast, so we will plan to wake up extremely early, go to the kiosk, and come back for breakfast (which starts at 7:00 am).","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603131,"Day 76: Abol Campground to The Birches Shelters (10 mi)
I had a pretty rough sleep last night because Fresh Feet tossed and turned the entire night. #marriedlife #tentlife
I set an alarm for 4:45 am (first alarm in what seems like forever!) so we could get to the Baxter State Park kiosk to sign up for The Birches shelter first thing in the morning.  The Birches is limited to only 12 hikers at the site, and is first come first serve on the day of.  Basically, it’s a race to the kiosk to secure your spot the day you want to stay at The Birches (the base camp for summiting Mt. Katahdin).
Biscuits was REALLY looking forward to the all-you-can-eat continental breakfast buffet that was included with our campsite, so we planned to go back to Abol Campground after signing up for the shelter at the kiosk.  The kiosk was only 1 very easy and flat mile from the campground and we had an easy day ahead of us with only 10 flat miles to our base camp.
Last night, the Campground manager advised us to be at the kiosk very early, and told us about a shortcut back to the campground/restaurant for breakfast (which was at 7 am).  He told us that tons of people go to sign up before 6 am to make sure their name is on the list.  If we didn’t get our name on the list we would have to hitchhike into Millinocket (a town 1 hour away) and then hitch again in the morning and have to wait in the car line, for which the car gate doesn’t open until 7 am.  Anyway, the obvious preference was to stay at The Birches.
My alarm went off and it was still very dark and quite windy.  To my surprise, the tent rainfly was totally dry from all the wind despite the complete downpour last night.  I went to the bath house and brushed my teeth in a sink and did my business in a flush toilet!  Woohoo!  I came back to our tent and packed up quickly.  Biscuits and Fresh Feet packed up in record time as well! We started walking the 1 mile to the kiosk.  It was the flattest easiest 1 mile EVER!  As I crossed the small footbridge into Baxter State Park I watched a very large turtle waddle into the water from a beaver dam right next to me.
I got to the kiosk and found a pencil and jotted down my name - first name on the list!  Not long after a hiker named Walmart Special rolled up and then Fresh Feet and Biscuits just behind.  We then took the shortcut back to the restaurant and waited about 30 mins for breakfast with a bunch of other hikers.  I ate oatmeal and fruit for breakfast along with my soylent and was quite full.
We then started our day.  It was an extremely flat, easy and BEAUTIFUL 10 mile day.  The path hugged various rivers and river branches almost the entire time.  The water was so fast and gushing and the waterfalls powerful and loud.  It was a majestic feeling and felt so different from the AT path we had been hiking!  95% of the trail was Hollywood trail with a soft pine needle surface.  And despite all the rain from the night before, the path wasn’t wet at all! No mud! Woohoo!!
We had two river fords and the first one was where Fresh Feet caught up to me.  I watched him rock hop and then I attempted.  The water was SO strong and it was hard to use my poles to help me balance.  My shoes were slippery on the slick and smooth rocks and at one point my left foot slipped off the rock and went all the way in the water.  Ugh! I told myself that next time I would just take my shoes off and ford instead of trying to rock hop.  However, the next river ford seemed more tame and the rock hop easier, so I rock hopped and made it across with dry feet. Hooray!
When we arrived at the ranger station at the base of the Hunt Trail (bottom of Mt. Katahdin), no one was there. We needed to pay our fee and get permits to summit the next day. We signed in our names and headed to The Birches (shelter site) and figured the Ranger would surely hunt us down in search of our $10 camp fee and to cross check The Birches sign up sheet from this morning.
We set up our tent on the one double tent platform and I went to fetch water (down by the ranger station, 0.3 mi back).  We saw various hiker friends coming down the path as they had just finished their summit and hike! It was so exciting to greet and congratulate them all!
The crew of us that stayed at The Birches (only 9 of us!) all gathered around some benches and we built a fire.  The rain/wind from yesterday brought cooler weather and today was actually perfect temperatures and even a bit chilly! The warmth from the fire was nice and we were able to connect with new faces that we would summit with tomorrow.
I decided to walk back to the Ranger station and pay our fee and get the permits.  I asked her all my questions (How much water to carry? Poles or no poles? How hard is it really? Best place to catch a hitch to town after?) and she was super friendly and sweet.  She really changed my perspective on the rangers in Baxter as I had previously had the idea they weren’t super friendly or supportive of the AT thru hikers.  Not the case for us on this day!
We ate dinner around the fire, and all went to bed early with the idea of getting an early start to beat the day hiker traffic and have a more intimate summit experience.  
The excitement and emotions of us all sitting at The Birches the night before our summit was a special feeling, and something that brought us all closer and connected us in a unique way as each person (with the exception of Fresh Feet and I) was culminating their thru hike and taking turns feeling all the feels that comes with that.  It still felt like a finale of sorts for us as we wrapped up the northern chapter of our experience.  
Day 77: The Birches to Millinocket, ME (10.4 mi) Katahdin Summit Day!
Omg today was 100% epic!
I woke up quite cold at 4:24 am and got up to pee (it was 42 degrees)!! Once I was up and moving, the decision to get going up Katahdin had been made.  Biscuits and Fresh Feet got up and packed up with a mission this morning.  Baxter SP encourages hikers to only take essentials up Mt. Katahdin (no cowboy camping allowed), so most thru hikers leave sleeping gear and cook wear at the ranger station and take up a light pack since it is an out and back to the summit and back to base camp.  Biscuits was an exception to this rule and brought up his full pack!
Fresh Feet and I had all of our non essentials in trash bags and left them behind at the ranger station.  Our packs felt super light! I still brought most of my clothes with me because the temperatures can be quite bitter at the summit with high winds.  I also carried 1.25 L of water (because lately it has been so hot/humid), as well as 4 bars.  We drank our morning smoothies and left the bottles behind as well.  Wow.  Light packs felt so different!
We hit the trail at 5:30 am and Biscuits took off.  The first mile was a total cake walk.  It was so groomed and easy, I was still wearing my hat, long sleeve and puffy jacket.
The second mile I started to warm up with the climbing, but the terrain wasn’t technical.  It had a lot of stone staircases and a little bit of bouldering.
After the second mile it got a little more tough.  I had to use my hands for some climbing moves, but it felt fun! Having such a light pack made a HUGE difference for me in my ability to climb and scramble with ease and even enjoy it!  
The middle section, just above tree line was the toughest part, but because we had just come up above tree line we had our first views of the day.  At this point we were hiking with Walmart Special, who hadn’t had ANY views in the entire northern section of the trail (horrible weather for all the white mountains and southern Maine) and was absolutely blown away! The views were spectacular and we were just getting started! It slowed us down a bit as we continuously stopped to take in the surrounding beauty, savoring each moment.
We got SO lucky that there wasn’t a cloud in the sky! So many people have inclement weather on their Katahdin summits and we seriously lucked out and took the time to bask in the glory of the endless views.  It was a crisp morning, no humid haze, not too cold, not hot at all, and we took the climb slow enough to enjoy it and the views that we didn’t even work up a sweat.
The technical section involved some rebar hooks and a bar which marked the “monkey bar” section.  It was tough but SO much easier without the weight of my pack throwing my balance off.  It didn’t even feel scary.
We had some more scrambling to do up a rocky ridge but the views were so breathtaking it didn’t even matter.  At this point we became a posse of four as we were joined by Handyman.  The four of us had such a nice climb and were grateful to have each other to share the experience with and be in awe of the epic climb we were having together.
After the steep ridge rock scramble, we got up to the tabletop, a nice plateau, and we only had 1.5 miles left to the summit! The tabletop was at least 1 mi and it was smooth sailing ridge walking with some rocks in the trail.
The last part was a bit more steep and scrambly, but not bad! We could see other thru hikers at the top as well as the infamous Katahdin sign, marking the summit of the mountain (where every NoBo has a photo shoot and some emo moments).
Walmart Special and Handyman weren’t quite ready for the climb to be over so they slowed a little and Fresh Feet and I summited and took a few pictures with the sign.  Then they came up and I took pictures for them as they had their moments of glory for being DONE with their thru hikes!  One by one, more thru hikers came through, and it was pretty special to be a part of their summit experience knowing that they were done with the entire Appalachian Trail.  I felt excited and like a huge sense of accomplishment just having finished the northern half, but all of the hikers at the top have hiked twice as long! Incredible.
We began our descent, although there was no wind at the top so we really didn’t feel cold and hung out for quite some time.  I was aware that descending some of that very difficult terrain in the middle would probably be harder and sketchier than climbing it.
The descent went as well as it could have! I was surprised with how the tough parts with the rebar came somewhat naturally to me.  Climbing moves were just SO much easier with a light pack and I felt more in control of my body and weight.
We cruised through the last few miles and about 1.5 mi from the bottom we encountered a couple (day hikers) and the man’s shoe sole had completely come off his hiking boot! Something similar had happened to Fresh Feet with his Hokas in the Whites, so he offered to duct tape the man’s boot and sole back together to get him the 1.5 miles down.  They kindly offered us a ride into Millinocket in return for the duct tape help, which is a 1 hour drive!  Their kind offer saved us from having to hitch hike our way out of the park with people who were leaving to Millinocket.  It was beyond generous and kind for them to take us to our hostel in Millinocket.
After we finished the descent we went back to the ranger station to get our belongings when we saw a huge group hanging outside the station.  It was a college orientation trip! They had leftover spaghetti and red sauce and NUTRITIONAL YEAST and we were quite hungry so Fresh Feet and I helped them finish off their leftover pasta. Watching the incoming college freshmen on their wilderness orientation trip reminded me of my own college orientation trip, LandSea, where we spent 3 weeks in Canada backpacking and canoeing/portaging.  What a very special experience for young adults, and I watched and smiled from a short distance and chatted a little with a sophomore, who was a trip leader.
Then we waited for our Trail Angels to return to their lean-to and got a ride in their nice rental car into town.
We checked in, did laundry, went to find food, found Walmart Special at the restaurant and he ate with us, and we had a nice evening.  
Just as we returned to the hostel to turn in for the night, Biscuits texted Fresh Feet that he wanted to go out and celebrate, so Fresh Feet went out with Biscuits and other hikers for a late and celebratory night (I was totally wiped out and crashed).  Our ride to the Bangor airport in the morning with Biscuits fell through but we were able to book a shuttle last minute with two other hikers.
Day 78: Millinocket, ME to Philadelphia, PA. Zero day - THE FLIP
We woke up and packed up for our 7:30 am shuttle ride to Bangor airport.  As we were packing up to leave, Fresh Feet dropped his smoothie bottle in the driveway and the bottle completely broke!  Good thing we have time to get a new one before hitting the trail again.  
Gizmo and Mr. Maps joined us for the shuttle ride and we chatted and shared stories the whole way.
Once we arrived at the Bangor airport, we got in touch with aunt Debbie in Philly and she helped us figure out all of our Philly logistics. We are SO grateful for her mastermind to think for us and help us put our needs into action.  We were pretty tired and cashed mentally.
We got to the Philly airport and found cousin Jenn’s car in the parking garage for us (she dropped it off a few hours earlier as she had a flight out that morning).  We were SO grateful to have a car to drive around to do all of our city errands and are filled with gratitude for Jenn’s generous offering.  THANK YOU JENN for letting us borrow your car!
We went to two different shoe stores in the suburbs of Philadelphia (thanks to Debbie’s recommendations) and finally each bought a pair of new shoes for the SoBo half.  Fresh Feet got another pair of Hokas (Stinsons) and I tried on the Hoka Torrents, loved them, but ended up at the second store and got a pair of Salomons.  I was getting to a place of no return with my hunger level towards the end of shoe shopping, so we left to go get lunch just around the corner at a very cute place, Terrain (thank you for the suggestion Debbie!).  
After a delicious lunch at a beautiful cafe we returned to the shopping plaza where I got a new pair of shorts (to have a second pair for camp - I had given my spare pair to Red Stripe in the 100 mile wilderness). 
Aunt Debbie (superstar magician) also scheduled us 90 minute massages nearby! Getting our bodies worked on was MUCH needed and absolutely fantastic!
Debbie also found a very cool vegan Chinese Buffet event for us to have dinner at! Sarah, Ethan, Gray, and Debbie all joined for dinner and it was casual, very packed, and TONS of options at the buffet, and ALL VEGAN! It was a very unique dinner experience! We also enjoyed sharing stories with the cousins and Deb and stayed at the restaurant for 2.5 hours!
We finally landed at Debbie’s house on a farm (Mill Hollow) in the burbs of Philly and being there just felt like absolute paradise.  We watched a tiny part of the 10+ hour Aretha Franklin funeral and visited and shared pictures/stories with Debbie.  We stayed up past midnight, were exhausted, but hearts full from so much love and connection with family.
It was so odd to watch the Aretha Franklin funeral and find out about McCain’s death as well, because on the trail we are completely unaware of what is going on in the world.  Then we enter the world of cell service and we get bombarded with news.  It can be overwhelming to take the phone out of airplane mode.  Texts, emails, news, logistics, and just the general access to information feels like an insane amount of stimulation compared to our general state of isolation.  It makes me rethink how much “being on the grid” and “being connected” really does take its toll with its chronic undercurrent of stimulation. It can so easily be ignored or overlooked when existing in the “real world”, but once deprived from internet access for months at a time it is jarring when suddenly you are reconnected to the world. 
As we went to bed, the orchestra of crickets was alarming.  We had just come from Maine, where it was pretty quite at night with the occasional loon call, and the cricket concert was SO loud here in PA.  It’s interesting to think of how much more in tune we are with the sounds of the ecosystem now.  There were also owl calls, which is something we hadn’t heard in a while.
I laid down in THE MOST COMFORTABLE BED EVERRR and just sighed a proud, fully relaxed sigh of relief.  The North was over and I felt like I could breathe again without dreading the soul-crushing and often fear-inducing rock climbing terrain of New England. Phew!
Day 79: Philadelphia, PA to Elizabethtown, PA. Zero day - Flip day 2.
We slept in the most comfortable bed at Debbie’s farm house!!!  The mattress, pillows and bedding just swallowed me up and I felt like I was in absolute heaven!  Sleeping in that bed was complete luxury and comfort.  I had such a heightened sense of appreciation for the sweet feeling of the clean cotton sheets on my skin and the plushness of the pillows and heavy comforter on my body.  The environment at Debbie’s house helped me enter a new level of relaxation.
I took a long salt bath and a shower.  Using conditioner for the first time in at least a month felt so nice in my hair.  The wonderful soak and shower helped many of my bites begin to heal and my legs started to look like normal-ish summer legs (instead of diseased legs!)
We ate fresh berries and a banana with granola, seeds, nuts and raisins with delicious coconut yogurt for breakfast, while drinking tea and sitting and visiting on the front porch watching the occasional rain shower.  
Jamie went to visit his uncle who was in the hospital while I caught up with my parents on the phone.  
Our time frame was super tight to make it to the train station when Jamie came back from the hospital and we ended up missing the train by about 45 seconds.  Without hesitation, Debbie spontaneously offered to drive us the 1.5 hours (one way) to Elizabethtown, PA, which was beyond generous and kind and gave us more quality time with her to visit and catch up. THANK YOU DEBBIE FOR YOUR OPEN HEART AND GENEROUS SPIRIT!  
We arrived at Cindy and Jim’s house in Elizabethtown, PA and had about an hour to settle in.  Cindy threw us with a picnic welcome home party with a crew of her friends from Elizabethtown who have all been following along virtually on our journey via the blog and GPS tracker.
All the friends began to show up and each one made their signature dish with a vegan twist!  Nancy made her baked beans vegan (without bacon), Kathy made her infamous 7 layer dip totally vegan, and Cindy made us grilled portobellos (marinated in balsamic) with a sweet corn, tomato, basil salad.  We feasted and shared stories from the trail and after some technical difficulties were able to show a slide show of pictures while Jamie told corresponding stories.  We also had mango and raspberry sorbet with fresh cantaloupe for dessert!
We felt so loved and supported from the Elizabethtown community and once again, our hearts full from the loving encouragement of friends and family.
I then spent some time organizing some of our stuff, threw some items in the laundry as well as the dishwasher, and got a resupply ready for the next few days as we embark on our SoBo portion of our hike.","

Sprout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603130,"Day 80: Duncannon, PA. to Darlington Shelter (11.4 mi)
We had a leisurely morning of getting a few things together and ate avocado toast with pink Himalaya sea salt and truffle olive oil at Cindy’s house.  It was so delicious!  We also ate leftover portobello mushrooms, sweet corn salad and Kathy’s vegan 7 layer dip.  We were pretty full by the time we hit the road.
We drove to Duncannon, PA, a small trail town where we had started our journey 2.5 months ago. Cindy and Jim hiked with us for the first bit, but it was 2:00 in the afternoon and with the heat index it was “feels like 102 degrees.” It was beyond hot and humid and we had a big, steep climb right out of Duncannon.
Fresh Feet and I were pretty sweaty when we got to the top, but also relieved that the climb wasn’t nearly as bad as we thought it would be! 
We took a break at the cut off trail for the shelter at our 4 mile point and ate a bar.  
We then hiked the next 7.2 miles without stopping because the mosquitoes were so bad.  We wore our bug nets and cruised.  We had some annoying rocky Pennsylvania trail for about 4 miles, but then afterwards the trail mellowed out quite a bit.
I’m wearing new shoes, Salomons, and I can feel every rock under my feet.  My feet hurt a lot on the bottom like they did at the beginning.  I might order a new pair of Hokas instead. The Salomon fit just doesn’t seem to be right for my foot.
We got to our shelter and met a few SoBos and had dinner.  The mosquitoes had been terrible all day, but actually weren’t too bad while we were setting up our tent and making dinner luckily.  It was hot today, but I think hiking from 5-7 pm while the sun was getting lower was much better!
There were a lot of gunshot noises (shooting practice?) and the crickets were SO loud!  
Jamie offered about 6 times to not hike and take these three days off too, but I was glad we got out here and put in some miles.  We will be getting off trail in two more days for double funerals. :(
Day 81: Darlington Shelter to Alec Kennedy Shelter (18.2 mi)
We woke up at 4:40 am to get a super early start today.  The heat was predicted to be as bad as yesterday (mid 90s with a “feels like” in the 100s) and we had a mandatory 18.2 mile day between shelters with a 10 mile stretch of no water and a lot of exposed field walking.  Needless to say, we wanted to beat the heat as much as possible.  
We hit the trail at 5:30 am with headlamps for the first hour.  We crushed and knocked out 14 miles (including the flat, exposed 10 mi stretch) before 10:30 am.  We walked into Boiling Springs, PA which is a small town right on trail with a gushing very cold spring in the center of town.  We decided we would hang out there for the day and wait out the heat since we only had 4 more miles until the shelter. The blistering humid heat made it impossible to even exist outside.  
The walk this morning was EASY! Omg! It was incredible how the terrain can be so different and feel SO much easier. Wow.  It puts the tough north terrain even more in perspective!
We went to a cute cafe just 1 block off trail called Cafe 101 and got vegan wraps and sandwiches and beverages.
I ordered new shoes (Hoka Torrent) to Cindy’s house since the new pair of Salomons were killing my feet. 
We then went to the ATC and hung out in A/C and waited out the heat with three other hikers (Colorado, Rocky, and Rebound).  We then decided to eat dinner at the tavern together because it was still super hot at 5:00, and we finally hit the trail at about 7:00 pm. Sunset was at 7:35 pm and was gorgeous.  The first two miles was field walking with a beautiful sunset with Rebound and then we had two small and gradual climbs with headlamps.  I hiked with Rebound in the dark (a 26 yo woman from NYC) and worked up quite a sweat in the crazy humidity.  When we got to the shelter, Fresh Feet’s backpack was there but he was nowhere to be found. He had gone to the spring (which was kinda far!) and brought back tons of water for everyone.  He had endless energy due to his excess town coffee intake all day and had a hard time settling down for bed.
We set up the tent in the shelter with Rebound as we had the shelter to ourselves (Colorado and Rocky and a few other people rented closer to the AT).
Day 82: Alec Kennedy Shelter to Pine Grove Furnace State Park (15.3 mi)
We woke up before sunrise, but later than I would have liked due to the heat wave.  We were on trail by about 6:45 am.  Sunrise is now at about 6:30, which is a little bit of an adjustment because it was about 40 minutes earlier in Maine, just a few days ago!
I have noticed the past few days that my internal compass can feel the change from going NoBo to SoBo.  In the mornings, the sun is on my left side, which feels odd, feels almost like evening sun or like I’m going the wrong way.  I kept wanting to turn my body around and walk the other direction. I had become so accustomed to the sun patterns headed north that my sense of direction felt off now headed south.  I didn’t even realize I was in tune with the sun’s position in the sky until we switched directions.  
I literally did not stop once today.  I just plowed on from 6:45 am to 12:45 pm without stopping at all.  My pee breaks were pack on and quick, I ate while walking, I made a skratch drink in my water bottle while walking, and I even took off my shirt (pack on) while walking.  It was absolutely scorching hot and the bugs (biting flies and mosquitoes were bad).  Stopping meant prolonging the misery, so I tried to maintain forward progress at all times.  
The last 6 miles were just so brutal on such easy terrain.  The heat was absolutely killer.  I felt myself starting to slow down and fade.  I dug deep and maintained nutrition even though the heat made me lose my appetite.  I ate my cliff chews, that helped, and with 2.7 mi left I drank some skratch, which gave me a tiny boost as well.  Fresh Feet was struggling today too.  It was just so hard when it is “feels like 100+ degrees” outside with insane humidity.  With about 0.5 mi left until the parking lot where we would end our day, I got into the very cold river and splashed off.  It was SO refreshing and completely necessary.  
We finally got to Pine Grove Furnace State Park where we met Jim and got in the van with A/C! Hallelujah! It felt so good to be done for the day and get off trail in that nasty heat. Ugh.
We will now be off trail for 5 full days for double funerals in PA.
Days 83 - 87: 5 day zero for double funerals in PA.
We took 5 full days off trail for double funerals and a transition day to wait out some rain.  We resealed our rainfly with silicone sealer, retreated our gear with permethrin, and washed our gear and packs with special gear wash.  
We started to see a lot of news about hurricane Florence gaining strength and upgrading to a category 4 storm and worried some about the creek and river fords ahead.  We will likely have to do some road walk arounds, which will add mileage and might even have to get off trail for the hurricane as well.  We will play it by ear, day by day.  I added an umbrella to my gear for this next portion (thank you Cindy for the pink umbrella!) :)","Pine Grove Furnace State Park
