Yesterday and today my focus has been on dehydrating and preparing 299 snacks, 139 breakfasts, 129 dinners and 149 lunches.  I made some good progress.  I have about 230 snacks packaged, vacuum sealed, and hanging out in the freezer when necessary.  I have most of 80 breakfasts done, one dinner, and absolutely no lunches.  
My gear needs list is growing in some ways . . . all the little things that make the hike easier, but may not be on the forefront of our minds keep popping onto my list.  Items like toothpaste, sunscreen, petroleum jelly, pens/pencils, scissors, razor . . . etc. And while sending photos to my son's coach I saw a photo of me in a USAFA rain jacket and realized I don't need a raincoat because I have one somewhere around here!
I am enjoying the process of getting ready to pack up.  
Hope to see you all out there,",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Sun",0
Shed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584097,"I woke up around 3am and lay there awake.  Memories of how I had prepared for past hikes in the Smokies kept me awake.  I trained for months before a week trip.  Walking miles.  Climbing stairs.  Running stairs.  Walking with a full pack.  And no matter what I did the start was always . . . well it was hell.  Everything hurt.  And when the tip of my nose hurt I knew I had a tough day of keeping up.  
I had big training plans for this trip. Every week, up until sometime in February, I had my dream journal filled with daily goals.  I even took a full pack to the gym and endured all the sideways looks!  When I walked I got in a minimum of 10 miles . . . so that is good.  But as always I let life get in the way.  
Let me rephrase.  I let others' lives get in the way of my life.  
Visions of my friend Paul out there in the hills of Ohio with his full pack training seeped in as I remembered . . .  Hike your own hike.  
That is the basis of my trip.  
I don't need to keep up.  I will walk at my own pace.
I don't need to lay the activities of my life down for someone else. I will only have myself on which to focus. 
I just need to hike my own hike.
Some say it takes two weeks to get your hiking legs (and this is no matter what you do beforehand);  Others say it takes 200 miles. My truth is that I will have many pairs of hiking legs.  And even though I did not lose the weight before hand that I was planning, or carry a full pack as often as I wanted, I will take on the A.T., entirely, at my own pace, eagerly embracing every step, every change, every shed.
On another note, I feel as thought I should be worried or scared of this adventure, but I am not.  Huh.  I mentioned this to Bridget yesterday. (hiking buddy)  And she said she knows I am just stubborn enough to make it through anything.  And walking at my own speed will make it all the better. . . . or something along those lines. (Hi Bridget!)
Well, I am off to box up the UPS mail drops and take them over to my friend Jill.  Her and her husband Bart will ship them off to me.
Hope to see you out there,

Waking up at 3:30am this morning was a breeze, having a great night of sleep.  Another sign that everything is as it should be in the world.
Derek, Peanut and I will (and I am thinking Butter too), will head south to Georgia any moment.
See you out on the trail!

Shed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584801,"Today was a good day . . . a successful day.
It was symbolic to begin the hike with Derek; to move on to complete the trail alone at my own pace . . . just as we began a life together and I was left to navigate the ups and downs of life alone.  It is cleansing to do this . . . the moment the car drove away I began to cry.  I felt an immense release . . . a calm. . . a thankfulness that all I have to do is get to the next stop and take care of myself.
I really like hiking at my own pace.  No one behind ""encouraging"" me to continue on; no one ahead ""encouraging"" me to move quicker.  I have a set goal to meet everyday and I can take my time doing it. No offense meant to anyone I have hiked with prior to this trip.
I met a number of people today - Andy, his father - Old Man, Stridder, Pathfinder, Ranger, Cody and a host of others I will never see again.
They all seem very nice.  
I hope to see them again. ~SHED","Base of Springer to hike up to the start of the A.T. and then hike down and onward!

Shed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584823,"9:10amAt shelter getting ready to head out (actual leave time was 10:10).  It is going to be a rainy day.  It's bound to happen. Wondering if I should forge quickly ahead to get to Hawk or loose a day.  I think I will stick to the plan.The hike started with a log shuffle to ford the first of 4, or 5, streams.  It rained over night so the log was slippery.  I decided to shuffle across moving my left foot slightly then bringing my right foot to it and repeating to avoid any miss-step or slippage.The climbs were decent. I found them strenuous as well as gratifying.2.4 miles into the hike as I approached the side trail to the Long Creek Falls Stridder and Pathfinder emerged having just seen the falls. They encouraged me to see the falls myself.  So I headed down the side trail as they forged north on the A.T.  I did an abrupt about-face when I heard thunder.  The weather forecast called for a thunderstorm around 2pm.  It was now just after 11am.  I am not sure exactly how I did it, but every time thunder filled my surroundings my stride quickened and I raced upward in search of shelter.  It all happened so fast!  Rain drops began, beaded up, and rolled off my raincoat.  And then the torrential downpour came with hail mixed in and I leaped into a run.  All I knew was tat I did not want to be where I was with this weather.And then it happened. My raincoat gave and I was soaked.  And the higher I climbed the colder it got.About a mile later I turned slightly and there, under a tree, were Stridder and Pathfinder! They decided to wait for me!Stridder is a young lady from France, who is currently living in Canada. She recently turned twenty and started the hike with her mom. They did the approach trail together and her mom headed home as planned.Pathfinder is twenty-eight and on leave from the Navy.  He is just hiking to North Carolina.Just after I found them the road to the cemetery shed appeared and off we went to find shelter. It was here I found my pack cover gave way as well. Thank God I sealed everything in a garbage bag!!! Pulling out my dry clothes I quickly changed and layed out my wet things to get a start on drying. We had 2 miles left in our hike to Hawk Mountain Shelter. So now we needed to decide if we set up camp here for the night or get back into our wet clothes and continue north.The rain slowed and the sun came out. It was hard not to focus on completing the planned hike as more blue sky filled in the tree tops. And so, we changed into our wet clothes, packed up and continued the climb to Hawk Mountain Shelter. Shelter spots are for A.T. thru-hikers and designated on a first come first served basis. Even so, Pathfinder, Stridder and I were hopeful that Cody and Ranger were able to snag us a spot.Nah-banna-nah . . . the shelter was full.And so I started a quick walk about to find a level, high ground spot to set-up my tent.  Once set-up I braved the cold light rain to cook dinner and sat at the picnic table enjoying my chili and ramon. Now I started devising a plan to lay out my wet clothes in my tent in hopes they would be drier in the morning.I had my thermals on, down coat, gloves and hat. I lay, light still outside, shivering in my sleeping bag.  I never did warm up from the raincoat failure earlier in the day.  And it felt as if I never would.  So I climbed out of my sleeping bag and put on my mid-layer wool tights as well.  This took are of the shiver.  I looked at my phone . . . no service. I shout my eyes and tried to sleep in the storm.  it was only 5:26 pm. Just minutes later I opened my eyes and saw my phone lit up. I had one bar. So I sent Derek a text: ""I love you. Rough day.""After some encouragement, both ways, my husband was handed a severance package just a few days before, we said our good-byes. I then checked the weather forecast for Hawk and Gooch Mountains, my current location and goal location for Tuesday night.  It was not good.  Decent morning . . . I might get dry before I headed out for the 7.8 mile hike up. But then rain followed by snow and freezing temps. Followed by at least one day of snow.  And the dreaded ""Nor-easter"" word had been spoken by Ranger (who had a satellite connection) prior to turn-in.By 7:23pm Derek and I had a plan for him to get me.  Folks I had little confidence that, due to my day's gear failures, I would weather the next two days well. So, I was headed home to regroup.Hope to see you out there . . . but maybe wait a week or two!","Stover Creek Shelter

Shed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584825,"It was 2:34 am the first time I felt the tent roof on my hip.  I turned on my light to check the seams of my MSR Flylite. They were holding well except the seam under the vent of the door.  So I tied the arms of my emergency rain poncho to my hiking poles (holding up the front of the tent) outside to give the door another layer of protection. The sagging of the roof was due to fabric saturation. I knew it would not be long until my tent gave way. 
It was not long before I noticed the growing puddle in my tent. The bottom of my sleeping bag had been breached. I quickly removed my socks and held them - they were my only dry socks!  I turned my light on again to access the condition of all my wet things laid out to dry. The sight was not spirit lifting.  i found my rope and fashioned a clothes line. Unzipping the door slightly I took each item and wrung it out quickly getting as much water out of it as I could and then draped it over the rope.
Settling down again, curled up in my sleeping bag i slept the next few hours with my arm extended upward keeping the roof of the tent off of me.
Just after six I awoke and lay there waiting for first light, as drops of water were added to the substantial puddle my sleeping mat barely kept at bay.
I took off for the privy at first light and was amazed as the sun took over the clouds and the rain seized.  I made coffee and breakfast.  An then started pulling all of my things out to lay them about the nearby log and rope fences.
I visited with Cody, Ranger, Stridder, and Pathfinder as my things slowly dried.
I needed to be ready to hike down by 11am. Cody headed out unsure of his wants to avoid the snow ahead. I let him know Derek would be at Hightower Gap to get me at noon if he wanted a ride into town.
The outside of my tent was dry, so I lifted the back end to get the water out . . . SWOOOOSH . . . ""what was that?"" someone asked.
""The water in my tent""
""Wow! We had water issues too, but not like that!""
Ranger helped me hang my tent and I began the rounds checking the dryness of my gear. Slowly things dried. I changed into my hiking clothes and started to pack up.
Pathfinder and Stridder moved into the shelter. They would take a zero day with Ranger in hopes of Stridder's ankle feeling better. (They would leave the trail the next day due to snow . . . here is where I lose track of them)
Just before 11am Andy hiked toward the shelter announcing he and his father were leaving the trail for a zero day, hoping to get a shuttle.  I offered to give them a ride to town and Andy hiked back to collect his father.  Just after 11am I headed up the side trail to rejoin the A.T. and at the top Oldman waited for me.  Andy would follow soon. And so we started the half mile descent of Hawk Mountain into Hightower Gap. By 11:44 all three of us settled in to wait for Derek.  I gave Andy the trail name of Do-over.  Why? you ask . . . well see Andy would hike 4-5 miles drop his backpack and then hike back to get his father's backpack and hike it to the same location as his pack, and then hike back to help his father.  ""Do-Over"" seemed appropriate since Andy hiked the trail over and over in very small increments.
Derek arrived at 11:57 am and we delivered Do-Over and Oldman to the Black Hills Cabins. Oldman said he was heading home from there.
The ride home was full of emotions for me. Many scenarios of how and when I would return to the trail were discussed. Derek received a severance package the Friday before I left.  No one would blame me for returning to work and putting off my thru-hike. I could return to the trail after school let out and whatever I did not finish this summer I could the next.
But Folks, as the miles from the trail increased so did my desire to be there.
I am thankful my real trail trial of my old and faulty gear occurred early and under favorable circumstances.
I am thankful to be home to regroup, re-gear and see my son, who is home on Spring Break.
I am thankful to be home to offer more consistent support to my husband during this time of uncertainty.
And I am ready to set out on my thru-hike April 3rd picking up right where I left off at Hightower Gap.
Happy Easter Everyone!
Hope to see you out there!","Hawk Mountain Shelter

I am curled up with my pups. I, for the first time, am filled with doubt. My husband lost his job just a few days before I headed out the first time. Is it irresponsible of me to head out for five months when I should be working?  What if I get hurt? 
And yet, I know now is the time. Perhaps the only time for me to shed everything as I bath in the trees. It was miraculous what happened the first two days. I can only imagine what God will do with with the next 148 days. 
And so, I will start my day.  Walk the pups. Eat breakfast. Load up my pack. And begin the journey back to the trail

Shed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585651,"Defeat is a state of mind. My mind won today. I summitted one of the steepest mountains I will face in Georgia. And the whole way up I fought negativity. “You can’t do this. You don’t want to do this. Derek just returned to you. What are you doing out here? Go home! He lost his job. You should be working. This is too hard. This is for the young and able bodied. Get off the trail and go home.” I quickly lost sight of the monumental accomplishment I was making with every step. 
Duffy, provided me my first trail magic today. A Gatorade. He also picked me up at the bottom of Sassafras Mountain. I lost many tears and a bit of blood on that mountain (took a rocky tumble). And I could not fathom hiking up a third mountain today. So here I am at a local hostel licking my wounds and crying my heart out.
Am I giving up? Oh boy, I really want to, but I’m not ready yet. Tomorrow I’ll finish today’s goal. And then we’ll see. I know for sure that I am not ready to disappoint myself. And I keep thinking of Bryton, all the things she goes through daily that any one of us would quit at the first sign of discomfort, and this isn’t so bad. Blue skies, great company and the ability to find a comfy place for the night.

Shed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587143,"Derek took me back to Hightower Gap and I headed upward. It was a challenging up and down. Along the 2.1 miles to Horse Gap I ran into Miss Janet.  Her van ran out of gas up on the road just about 200 feet from where I was hiking.  Miss Janet is a well known trail angel and runs on of the area hostels.  Her demeanor is love and I enjoyed our conversation.  She told me a bit of her hiking experiences. Warned me to let go of all my preconceived ideas of the trail as it would be nothing like I expected.  And if I was doing it to lose wight to head home and do the work there. ""Escaping to the woods will get the wight off but everything that put it on is waiting for you when you get back. Better to deal with it while you focus on getting in shape.THIS WAS THE FIRST SIGN TO GO HOME.When I arrived in Horse Gap (2 miles) Duffy was there with the first trail magic I would experience. A Gatorade. It was nice. He told us the next 2 miles would be the toughest in GA.  And then I headed up Sassafras Mountain (all I can say is she is a BITCH!!!); one of the steepest mountains in Georgia.Some where high was the perfect rock looking out across the perfect view of the valleys and mountains around me.  I sat on that rock and took in all the beauty. And I began to cry. Pain, disappointments and anger flowed from me.""Hey! It's not that bad. What's wrong?"" I heard.I turned to see this mountain of a man with a red beard to match and spilled everything.  And by spilled I mean blubbering speech, sobbing breaths and snot to cap off what must have been the most terrifying moment of this man's life! Every moment of the past decade, and then some, blurted out.In response Big Red asked, ""Why do women like to be treated badly?""In an instant my tears dried up as the word ""perspective"" echoed about my mind, and I turned to him and said, ""Women don't like to be treated badly. It may seem my husband was treating me badly but he wasn't. He was going through something tragic and he got lost. And thinking he was treating me badly made things worse. Sometimes you just need to step back and wait for your partner to return.""THIS WAS THE SECOND SIGN TO GO HOME (my husband just came back - what was I doing leaving him to cope alone)Making it to the top of Sassafras Mountain was AMAZING!  I DID IT! And now the down!  It was rock! My feet took a beating and then my left foot laid down just shy of where I intended, upon a loose rock and before I knew what was happening my ankle rolled and the rest of me followed.I was able to easily get on my hands and knees.  And then, with the help of a tree I pulled myself to a standing position.  I hiked a bit further to a fallen tree and sat down.  I removed my pack and started accessing the damage.Blood was streaming down just before my left ear - head wound.  Left side of my body was sore, sharp rib pain, ankle was just fine. POSSIBLY THE THIRD SIGN TO GO HOME.""Holy cow man! We saw you fall. Are you okay?""Bubbles and Shaggy approached from above. They saw my tumble and reported I never stopped moving. (This was good news given the head wound) They hung out with me while they took a few hits and continued on when they were convinced I was alright.I continued my descent and Cooper Gap could not have come too soon. I took off my pack and plopped down leaning against it. I had a single bar on my phone and proceeded to text my children. I had come 3.6 miles and had 3.5 to go. I left at 9:46 and it was now 1:25. I was not confident I could make camp - Good Mountain Shelter in time.Jack sent a text which said, ""I just want you to be happy.""HAPPYAM I HAPPY?I mean I sure ACT happy, but AM I HAPPY?WHAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY?This is when I met Queen Bee and Bumble Bee.","Hightower Gap

The mother and daughter duo brought with them hope and will for me to continue on. Home schooled, the daughter had completed the year and applied to college. And they were both enjoying having no responsibility.
The work RESPONSIBILITY hung in the air.
And there, like more trail magic, was Duffy in his truck . . . my hand went up to flag him down and the words came out as if compelled by some other force besides my own . . . ""Can you take me to the Black Hills Hostel?""
""Darl'n I'll take you any where you want. I'm headed to the falls I can be back in 40 minutes""
""If I'm gone I headed up Justus, but I'm 99 percent sure I'll be here.""
RESPONSIBILITY flooded all my senses . . . so many perceptions . . . I got lost in them all . . . and what seemed like a blink of the eye ended up to be around 40 minutes.
Duffy arrived just as I stood up to start up Justus Mountain. I was relieved to see him as I had trouble getting my pack on . . . sharp pains shot thru my ribs.

I still felt torn between the trail and home.  I prayed that today God would make it clear . . . the direction I should go . . . further into the woods or home.Reaching the top of Justus Mountain was hard but yet much easier than the climb yesterday. Descending Justus was uneventful and easier than Sassafras, but equal in rocky landscape. I stopped for a quick snack and to get water at Justus Creek.Here I joined paths with Bubbles and Shaggy as they packed up their camp to hike on. Gooch and Blackwell were full so they hiked back to Justus Creek to camp.Blackwell Camp joined me with Queen Bee, Bumble Bee and Big Red, but only for a jaunt as I stopped at Gooch Mountain Shelter.Shaggy and Bubbles were only section hiking and leaving the trail the next day, Thursday. Shaggy asked if I wanted a ride home the next day. I was in A LOT of pain and he and Bubbles were concerned. ""At least let us take you to the hospital,"" Bubbles pleaded.  It is moving to me how quickly we care for each other out here.""I'll be fine,"" I dismissed them and began to set up camp.  It was a cooler day. I explored the area, made my dinner around 4, took some pain meds, a few swigs from my flask and drifted to sleep by the sounds of other arriving, muted by the wind.My only regret for the day is that I did not take pictures.  I was preoccupied with my thoughts and body.","Cooper Gap

I began to think I broke a few ribs.  I tended to my feet as my breakfast cooked and checked for bruising while using the privy.I reviewed the days hike.7.9 to 10.4 miles, most easy ups and downs with one major climb up Big Cedar Mountain. My plan was to camp at Lance Creek or someplace between Lance and Jarrard, with high hopes to make it all the way to Jarrard.I was on my way and had a peaceful, solitary hike. I stopped for a short break and water at Gooch Gap, just shy of 2 miles.  Ramrock Mountain was easy with an immediate steep, but short, climb. I reached Woody Gap (about 5 miles), emptied my garbage, used the restroom and as I readied to continue there was Shaggy and Bubbles.""Want a ride?""
