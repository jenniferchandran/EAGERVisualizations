Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588806,"Here's the plan: leave from Boiling Springs, PA the morning of Saturday May 12th and head north. Assuming I make it to Mt. Katahdin in Maine, I will travel south to Georgia (by means yet to be determined). Then I will demand that my friend Josh pick me up, let me borrow his shower, and drop me off at the southern trail head. Once again I would hike north back towards Boiling Springs. First snag today: the tent I ordered will definitely not arrive in time since they are all on back-order. Need to find something else in the next week and a half.","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589240,So I arrived home tonight and discovered that my tent had been delivered today! So happy to have this discovery. Monday is my first day of no-work so I will set it up then and take a picture. I'm relieved to actually have it in my possession.,"

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589664,"stress is a weird thing in that it automatically assumes the worst possible outcome of a situation. As I am wrapping up the planning portion of this adventure, one of the most challenging pieces is the question of food and resupply. The basic plan is for friends to ship me food boxes periodically to places like post offices and hostels. It’s the specifics of exactly where and when and how much to send that seem utterly impossible to know. The stress part of my mind immediately alerts me to the fear that I could starve to death out there. If I let it, this fear will take over. What will help me keep it at bay? A few quiet deep breaths, closed eyes, and the reminder that others have done this with far less experience than I have. Thank goodness for the learned ability to notice when I feel stressed. Besides, I’m not even leaving my own country! How hard could it be?!","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589944,"I decided to change my overnight location Saturday from Darlington shelter to Cove Mountain shelter because this will line me up better with the next several shelters along the trail, which may be a welcome sight considering all the rain that is in the forecast in the next week. However, this means that I will be doing a 21.6 mile day on my first day. I was concerned that this distance would be too much for a first day out with a heavy pack. (I've done close to that before but was pretty tired the next day.) Fortunately, a friend offered to slack-pack me from Boiling Springs to Scott Farm which will make that distance/ weight combination much more doable. Otherwise I would likely have needed to change my starting location to Trindle Road, when I really had my heart set on Boiling Springs. Glad for helpful friends and all they do to support me.","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590138,first day on the trail was a good one. Grateful to be able to slack the first ten miles to allow me to total 21.6 today which puts me in a better place for the next several shelters in light of continuous rain in the forecast. I made it to the shelter today about 20 minutes before it started pouring. Currently laying in a warm sleeping bag inside the shelter listening to the massive thunder storm.,"Boiling springs

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590343,not easy to pull myself out of a dry shelter this morning but I did. Hiked into duncannon hoping for breakfast but sadly nothing but the convenient store was open. Got a snack and kept hiking though it was raining. Mostly it was just drizzling the rest of the day. Have a blister forming on the ball of my left foot which has me a little concerned. Lanced it and will cover it tomorrow in hopes that it won’t be too troublesome on an 18 mile day. Looking forward to warmer temperatures tomorrow.,"Cove mountain shelter

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590529,"stayed last night at the Rausch Gap shelter but I put up my tent for the first time. It was so much more comfy (and warm on a cool night) than the shelter. Around 5:45am I heard thunder so I jumped up and packed everything up which was a slight bummer since I had thought I’d be able to sleep a little later today. Oh well. In the end it didn’t rain, which I’m glad for. Checked my blister thinking I’d have to lance it again after all the walking yesterday, but surprisingly it didn’t need it. I think it may heal over into a callous. Anyway, it really isn’t bothering me today. Currently awaiting a quick visit from a friend, then about 7 more miles to the shelter. Calling for more rain this afternoon and tonight so will likely sleep inside the shelter again. In the meantime it’s clear and sunny and pleasant.","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590531,"regarding all mountains or climbs that make you sweat and/or breathe heavy: I have decided to treat them with the complete lack of respect that they actually deserve. They think they can beat me? That’s adorable. I may break them up into a hundred little pieces, but in the end, it is me that will win.","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590667,"today was one of the hardest hiking days I’ve ever had. It rained again, but honestly, as long as it isn’t a torrential downpour, that really hasn’t bothered me so much. What was difficult was the last 1.5 miles where the trail had turned to a literal river in the woods. It seriously had its own current. Obviously it had been this bad for awhile because there were routes all around it that people had been forced to create by walking, but those were flooded also. Also, there were not a lot of blazes which made it difficult to even follow the trail. The rivers would spread apart and I honestly didn’t even know which one was the AT. I am normally a whole-hearted supporter of volunteer trail maintainers, but this was pathetic. Hey SATC people: need a new project? The 2 miles south of route 183 are in desperate need of your tender loving care. I’m grateful for a warm and dry hostel to stay in tonight, and grateful I didn’t get lost. Every single blaze was a relief. Hopefully tomorrow’s trail is in better condition. Tomorrow I’m thinking I will head to the town of Port Clinton where they allow hikers to set up tents under their town pavilion. (About 15 miles) This would be a great way for me to have a roof and give my tent a chance to air out a bit.","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590930,"so Wednesday night at the hostel was great. Then had a decent day hiking Thursday to Port Clinton and stayed overnight at a large pavilion owned by a local church. Hiked 14.8 to what I’d hoped to be a nice enclosed shelter (lots of rain predicted overnight) but sadly it was pretty dirty and mouse infested. I’d met a few hikers from the hostel and pavilion nights so I waited for them to arrive. No one wanted to stay there. Myself and 1 girl (kidsga) were able to get a free shuttle ride from a trail angel back to the pavilion. We both plan to take a zero day tomorrow because unfortunately it is expected to rain fairly heavy all day tomorrow also. My good friend Baxter is meeting up with me on Sunday anyway, so I will have him bring the two of us back to trailhead then. What I wouldn’t give for a sunny day right now!","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591317,"so it’s been a couple days: Saturday enjoyed a great zero day while it rained most of the day. Spent time at a great old barber shop with free donuts and coffee for hikers, out to lunch and then a visit from dad for dinner. Also met Fresh Ground, a Trail angel that loves to show up and surprise hikers. I ate his banana pancakes Sunday morning. After that my friend Baxter showed up and shuttled me back to Eckville shelter along with 2 other hikers. He hiked with me a few miles and then slack packed me for about 17 miles which was wonderful. I did the Knife’s Edge, a tricky rocky section and then stopped at Bake Oven Knob shelter. Today I started my hike knowing that there would be little to no water sources available. That meant I had to push for a longer day to Leroy Smith shelter, a distance of 23.5 miles. I also did the rocky climb up the climb by Palmerton. Super rocky! Tomorrow will be a pretty short day in comparison, then plan to arrive Wednesday morning in Delaware Water Gap, spend the day and probably get a hotel that night. Thanks to all of you that send me messages on here and text messages. Unfortunately I can’t seem to write back to your messages on here but I read them all and love them. Thanks for the love!","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591449,"another 20.1 miles today and my feet are done! Booked a room at the Pocono Inn, partially because it seemed to be the only place in town that had laundry, but sadly, it is out of order. Either that, or they just don’t care enough to fix it. (It is not a nice place.) however, at least it is indoors and dry and I got a hot shower. Initially I thought I wouldn’t get here until Wednesday morning, but with today’s rain all day I figured I’d keep going and at least be able to look forward to somewhere warm and dry to sleep. I plan to take a “zero” day here tomorrow, though I will likely move to the hostel at one of the local churches for the second night which would be a lot cheaper. I think my feet, and apparently left Achilles’ tendon, could use a break. I was really looking  forward to some fresh clothes, oh well.","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591799,"so yesterday I hiked out of Delaware water gap about 11 miles to the Mohican Outdoor Center. It was a very nice hike, especially considering that I saw no bear evidence, a major change from the last time I was here. Last time I remember seeing tons of bear scat, over turned large rocks, and tracks everywhere. This time I saw none of that. Perhaps it is partially because the blueberry plants (which are absolutely everywhere) have no fruit on them yet. They are barely even flowering yet. We did see a bear from a distance at the outdoor center, but it was far enough away not to be a concern. Today I decided to go for another 20 mine day. It was long, but it allowed me to push past the shelter where I had seen multiple bears last time I was in New Jersey. Again, I saw no bear evidence today. At mile 17 I can to Culver’s Gap Rd and stopped at a restaurant that is right by the Trail. It was a warmer day, with again very few water sources so I was thrilled for the chance to get a meal, have a big glass of water and fill my water bottles. Ended the day 3 miles later at Gren Anderson Shelter. Tomorrow will be a shorter day. I’ve learned that 2 long days in a row are not yet what I enjoy. Ps- I invented a word today: slightlier. It means that when two things are just slightly different, the one that is less different is slightlier.","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592005,"yesterday I hiked into High Point State Park in NJ. Imagine my pure joy when the woman at the office asked me if I was a thru-hiker, and when I affirmed, she gave me an ice cold can of Pepsi. It was fantastic. Then I stopped at the lake (taking the not-the-Best-way-to-get-there-Trail, but oh well.) The lake, a free shower and some lunch were all wonderful. Fortunately I was able to get directions for a much better way back to the AT. A short distance later and I was at the shelter for the night. Four other women that were hiking together joined me there, and I really enjoyed talking with them. A sixth woman showed up late and put up her tent. That’s right, 6 women and 0 men at a shelter site. Unheard of. Kind of neat. Today I said goodbye to the ladies and hiked to Unionville, NY where I stopped at a general store for something to eat and some resupply groceries. It rained a bit this afternoon but it wasn’t heavy. The next few miles were refreshingly flat and rock-free, followed by a short climb up to Pochuck Mountain Shelter. Here for the night. Have a great day everyone!","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592276,"yesterday was another shorter hike, ending at Wawayanda shelter, near the state park. Unfortunately I had a hard fall yesterday that hurt a bit, but left no damage. Darn those wet rocks. Today I hiked north again, stopping at 2 places on route 17A for a hot dog and the Bellvale Creamery for homemade ice cream and a waffle cone. So good. Intended to stop at Wildcat shelter, but it was so early in the day, that Furnace (older guy I’ve been matching days with for a couple days now) and I decided to go just a bit further to Fitzgerald Falls for a camp site. I remember walking by here once previously and it is really nice. This will also make our hike tomorrow more around 17 miles instead of 19, a welcome idea given that the terrain is supposed to be tough. A quick wash in the falls on a hot day is just perfect.","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592483,"yesterday was a long day with some very tough hiking. In distance it was just over 17 miles, but it felt much longer. It also turned out to be a very slow hiking day. It took me about 10 hours. (Usually I average about 2.25-2.5 mph) Total there was about 2433 feet of elevation gain, plus all the decent that came in between it all, and all of it was rocky. I did get to make a short stop at Island Pond and rinse off a bit which felt great on a hot day. There was also the “lemon squeezer”, a very tight squeeze between enormous boulders and another spot where it really takes two people to take turns climbing up it, and then hoisting packs up to each other. There’s no way I could have done it alone. Fortunately I’ve been hiking lately with Furnace, and we worked it out together. Otherwise, I would have had to take the sign marked “easy way” and go around it. As it was, my feet were throbbing at the end of the day.Today I was grateful for a shorter 10 mile day, up and over Black Mountain and Bear Mountain. The hike ended with a walk through the Bear Mountain zoo, complete with a couple bears on display. (I still haven’t seen a Bear while hiking on my own thank goodness, but it seems like everyone else has.) from there we had a shuttle ride to the Stony Point Retreat Center for a nice place to spend a night. It was definitely time for a hot shower, laundry, WiFi, and a few big meals. For lunch I ate two big plates worth and didn’t even feel “full.” (I just remembered I forgot to ask what time dinner starts!) hiker hunger is definitely setting in, I just wish I could carry this many calories into the woods with me!","

Grizz,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592727,"so yesterday I woke up surprisingly discouraged considering I had just spent a night in a warm bed. (Maybe that’s why) of course it was raining. Again in the morning. After a late breakfast at the retreat center, we were driven back to the trail where the first thing we did was walk across the Hudson River. It was only a 6.5 mile day which included a resupply at a convenient store (what the wouldn’t give for a grocery store), and ended at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center (a Franciscan monastery) where they allow hikers to use their ball field and pavilion. Woke up early today and managed to push out 19.2 to the next shelter which is very nice (RPH shelter). It’s built of concrete blocks and has bunks and a covered table which is great considering the forecast for thunderstorms overnight.","
