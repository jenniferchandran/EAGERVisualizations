little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/33705,"Hi I'm a soon to be 50 year old wife(28 yrs),mom( 3children 26,25,21), registered nurse, and mortgage broker(family business). I am in the research stage of doing a thru hike of the AT. I am busy with reading everthing I can get on hiking(never done much before), the AT, and other's experiences of thru hiking.It's amazing how much info is available on the internet. This journal site is very helpful and also the AT sites.Reading of other's experiences is very helpful since in their accounts they sometimes mention good stop over places and comments on the terrain and how well their gear/equipment is holding up. I plan to start if possible in March/April 2004, South to North. As of now I am going solo but would really like a hiking partner( camping is not my husband's forte)I have also recently started getting into better physical condition w/ strength training.(carrying a 35-50 lb pack is no easy feat especially when doing so uphill). Doing the Trail will be for me a physical, emotional and spiritual challenge. That's all for now will keep you posted on my progress.DOLLY",,the journey begins,"May 14, Wed",0
little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/33899,"Reading the journals on this site and books written by other thru hikers have been very helpful.But I must tell you alot of my fears are surfacing as I read them. I have not ever done any major or even minor hiking. And never any mountains. The only mountain I tried to climb was Stone Mt in GA . I made it about 1/2 way up. And that was 8 years ago. Now i'm 50 years old & overweight. The AT will be a physical, mental & spiritual challenge to me. I realize it is not easy but I'm not going to let any negative thought take root in me. As I shared my desire to take this journey even my husband and daughters looked at me like I was crazy and they all had quite a CHUCKLE .This has not deterred me but all the more has given me the determination to prove to them and to myself that they are wrong. Commitment and determination have never failed me when I have put my mind to something. As stated in my first entry my start date is in March 2004 northbound. Basically now I am reading everything I can get my hands on about the AT and Thru Hikers experiences. Researching gear and physical preparation with strength training are also on the agenda. Even though I haven't done any hiking I am an outdoors lover. I enjoy solitude in nature, I love the ocean and the woods.The sounds of nature soothe and comfort me. inwardly. I am a Christian and enjoy all the wonders my God has created and given to us for our pleasure.
Well anyway I'm going to enjoy the preparation and research challenge of my future journey now. I'm open to any suggestions or helps and hints.
To all who are on the trail or are hoping to be on the trail soon peace and good weather and not too many critters in the shelters.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/33990,"Hi y'all. I don't think I really told you about my self too much. Ilive in Boca Raton, FL. Have been here in Florida since 1973. Originally from Paoli, PENNA, near Phila. Not many mountains here in FLA. I think it's the flattest state in the union outside of Kansas and Nebraska. I'll be in TN this summer for a WEEK I should be able to get a couple good mountain hikes in then. I'm 50 years old, or I will be in two months. My age doesn't bother me really when planning my hike. I'm in good health except having to lose weight. Right now I'm concentrating on strength training and endurance. Believe me not much endurance right now. I read that the best thing to do to get physically ready for the Trail is to run steps til you vomit(that's a direct quote!) I got on a stairmaster the other day and lasted about five minutes. Lots of work ahead.There are a few things that I 've read that give me the chills(but does not deter me) One are the rodents in the shelters.Just thinking about a mouse running over my face or getting into my sleeping bag...you'll probably hear me over the next mountain range. But not to worry i can always sleep outside if its not raining in my trusty tent if I can remember how to put it up. You're probably thinking what a wimp. How does she expect to hike 2000 miles. One day at a time my friend. And probably at the beginning one mile at a time. And I'm sure I'll have days where it will be one step at a time but a long journey begins with the first step. ANd we never grow unless we step out of our comfort zone. I guess that's what this Hike is all about for me. Stepping out of my calm, comfortable and predictable life that I love and pushing myself to limits unknown. I'm sure the Trail is up to the challenge and with God's help I hope to be too.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/34385,"Holiday weekend coming up YEHHHHHHHHH. Hope to get to some gear shops and start trying on packs. The trail is always on my mind. I'm a list person. Lists of gear and food and interesting tidbits i've read from other's journals. I ordered the Thru-Hiker's Handbook by Dan""Wingfoot"" Bruce and the Appalachian Trail Workbook for Planning Thru Hikes By Christopher Whalen. From reading the Journals it seemed these were the two books that most people recommended and that helped them the most. I also ordered Walking Home: A Woman's Pilgrimage On the Appalachian Trail by Kelly Winters. I think this book has alot to do with why I am doing this hike.As the title infers the author's hike was a journey, a pilgrimage. I like this word pilgrimage.To me it implies more than just a common journey but one with spiritual significance to the individual. I have to explore this more and look forward to reading the book. I don't really know how you get a trail name whether you get it after you start, if you can pick it yourself or others on the trail give it to you. I have read both. Until I start I'll think of myself as PILGRIM. If it sticks ok if not I'll see how others perceive me on the trail. That will be a clear window to how others see me and how I see myself. TO BRING THE TWO INTO ONE WILL BE MY PILGRIMAGE and I hope the Trail will help.",,View Entry,"May 20, Tue",0

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/83039,"Hi Y'all
I had an interesting talk with my oldest daughter about my thru hiking plans. She tries to be encouraging but I got the impression she thinks I'm just going out there and hiking. I tried to reassure her that I'm making many plans and have been doing research and reading about this for almost two years. Her friend/roommate in San Diego is formerly of Outward Bound.And they're both freaking out because ""I don't know anything about hiking and why do I have to do this now and alone!!!"" I tried to reassure them that you're really not alone on the AT unless you really want to be.That I'm learning as much as I can and reading about other thru hikers experiences and communicating thru chats and web sites with other AT thru hikers and those planning to leave same time I am.I'm reviewing gear lists and researching gear on the web and going to outfitters and looking at what's available. I've also started training physically for the ""Long walk in the woods"". I may be 51 years old, never did any long distance hiking, never even had a pack on my back before...but I'm not stupid or irresponsible. Crazy!!! YES.I'm not expecting it to be easy. But I'm going into this with my eyes open and heart bursting for the experience...the experience of breaking free and dancing on my terms I hope she understands that even if just a little.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/83042,"Hi y'all
I just bought from the ATC store the first of the maps I'm going to need for my hike. I'm sure my eyes will be opened to the many ""ups and downs"" I'll be experiencing on the AT.I got the Southern and New England maps. 
My goal these days has gone from the general research into gear to seeing what is available for light packing. I really like the frameless pack that i've read about. If anyone has any experience with them let me know. I want to keep my pack weight to around 25lbs excluding water.From looking at gear lists of other hikers I think this is doable if I choose what I take carefully and not take too many special ""extras"". I was planning on taking a pump for purifying my water along the way but I found these drops called ""Aqua Mira"" and from the scientific and trail testing that has been done with them, I think I could probably use them instead of taking a pump. Again.. If anyone has any comments on this please let me know.
Anyway I'm enjoying the research and finding new things and ideas. Five months sounds like a long time but time flies when you're having fun.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/84472,"Hi all, 
Well I've finally started the huge task of getting the gear needed for my hike. My new start date is April 2nd,2005. I pushed it back a couple weeks hoping most of the snowy weather will be past. But not so sure. I didn't want to start any later because getting to Baxter by Oct 7th or a little before is my goal. Anyway I'm planning for at least very cold, wet weather in the beginning. So far I have a Kelty Trail dome 2, a Slumberjack Ultimate 20F Thermolite sleeping bag and a Gregory G-pack internal frame. My goal this weekend is to breakout the tent and learn to set it up. Too bad I didn't have it when we had all those hurricanes a few weeks back. Trying to set up a tent in 80 mile winds and driving rains would have been good practice. 
I've been reading up on water purification and decided to go with the Aqua Mira drops. I'll carry a bladder since using these drops is a little process and I'll try to purify a couple quarts at a time.From what I've read these drops take care of all the ""bugs"" you can P/U along the trail from the water. I sure hope so. I'm also about 90% decided to use a stove that burns the tabs. I've read a few jounals that had them and I'll have the tabs shipped as needed or keep them in a bounce box. I don't think I have enough skill to use the soda can ones.. I have checked out antigravitygear.com. He has a lot of interesting gear, most very weight conscious and even ultra. Next step after mastering the tent is to get shoes/boots and start filling the pack up and breaking the shoes in by hiking with the pack, starting with 5-10 lbs and working up. Hopefully I can keep it around 20 lbs not incl water or food. I'd rather do without a few comforts and take it easy on the back and knees.
   My daughter is graduating San Diego State University in June so I'll be taking 3-4 days off the trail then. But she's planning to come and hike a few weeks with me afterwards. I don't want to take too many days off since I might get too soft and have to rev up again when I return.
Anyways enough rambling on. I just wanted to check in with the gear update. All comments and suggestions are always welcomed.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/85341,"Hi Yall
Just a little check in. Was in Calif and Oregon over Thanksgiving with an extended week vacation. Visited family in Eugene, Oregon and had Church Conference in Bay area...but still had some time for a little trekkin. Up and down San Fran streets was just a small fortaste of the up and down of the AT. Was a good warm up though. Planning to go to the Ruck gathering of the Florida Trail Assoc at end of month. Looking forward to seeing other hikers and learning a thing or two from some of the more experienced. When the plan are finalized I'll make plans to attend the Southern Ruck of AT and other long distance hikers.
Gear is coming along. I got my esbit Stove and fuel tabs. Will try them out this weekend.
Anyway, April'is just around the corner. Everytime I think about this whole thing it's almost a dream.and my stomach gets a knot of excitement...and a little fear. A journey of a million steps begins with the first one . When I take the first real step onto Springer the dream journey will become a reality. I look at the growing pile of gear and I ask myself are you crazy, you can't just walk away for 6 months. Who's going to take care of everything you do. and of course most importantly Will my dog still love me when I return? Mapped out tentative stopovers for hubby visits along the way but don't want to be too constrained with time tables except Katahdin by Oct 15.
Anyway.. this little check in has become a big check in.
Keep you posted.

96 days and counting
Well I'm still in the gear gathering mode these days. I've ordered alot and also sent alot back. Like I stated before I'm not much for going the stinky, grimey route and have decided to take a little more clothes in my pack and lighter options for food.It will probably be the least of my worries when I actually get out there. I tried out my ESBIT stove and works great. I guess I'm fine tuning the gear right now. I'm going to a hiker gathering in North Carolina in Jan,2005 and hope to get the fine tuning down to a T.
   Everytime I start thinking about this whole thing I immediately start to argue myself out of it. But that's been my MO for years. The gear piles continue to grow and I ask ""My God what have I gotten myself into."" I really am crazy, I need my head examined... and really who do I think I am that I think I can do this thing. Still not much support at home. I see the smoke comin out of my Hubby's ears whenever I even mention it. He did some of these things when he was a teenager and doesn't want to get involved Oh well this is for me. I have come to the conclusion, even now as I'm writing this, that I must look at this as an adventure, a once in a lifetime experience. I have decided to apply that old adage ""One day at a time..."". My dream is to do a one time thru hike. But I must see it as a sum total of steps and days to be taken individually. And this somehow releases me from some of the fear. I don't want fear to be a part of this journey. Awareness & knowledge of my own boundaries and capabilities yes but never to shrink back from fear of my ability to succeed. I look forward to meeting new friends and stretching my own boundaries a little or maybe even alot. Climbing Big K is at the end of this journey and turning around and going back down begins another. From here to there will be a forgetting those things which are behind and stretching forth towards goals that are new everyday. These days are not for those that shrink back but for those that eagerly await the dawning of a new day and the chance to walk a few more steps... a few more miles.
Thanks for listening

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/86081,"88 days and counting!!! Well I've just about got all my main gear in house as of last night.You wouldn't believe the amount of stuff I bought and eventually returned. Most of my stuff I bought from Campmoor so some weren't what I thought they were or size wasn't right. Now what's left is to gather the little items and pack and repack everything to an acceptable weight and position. I also must break in the hiking shoes(2 prs) I've just recently bought. Everything I've done up to now has really been all the fun stuff. Reading about everything, gathering info and buying all the gear. Now, like the title to this post states, it's time to get down to business. Getting in better shape business that is. With ONLY 88 days to go most of my preparing activities will entail hauling my full pack around the neighborhood and up and down stairs...since there are no mountains or even large hills around me(I live in Florida). I'm going to a hiker gathering in a couple weeks in N Carolina though and hope to put a few miles on in mountain terrain.I guess we'll see just how ""ready"" I am for this ""walk in the woods"".
There are a lot of things still to be done and worked out though. Like food & mail drops. I want to minimize the need for maildrops as much as I can since there really isn't much support for that kind of thing at home. I've been going over in the ATC Data Book the mileages between towns and what's available in each in the way of supplies. I don't want to go anymore that 2 miles off trail to get to a town since the miles there and back do not get me any closer to Mount K and hitchhiking in and out really is not an option. If I find I really need something I could always call and ask for someone to mail something specific. Anyway these are ""little"" details that need to be worked out.
Til next time

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/87057,"Jna 15,2005 Took my first hike on the AT. A real eyeopener.
Things I learned on my first hike on the AT
1.I'll take an up over a down anytime
2.There's noone to depend on but yourself
3.If you dont have what it takes to get home you better find it real quick 
cause there's no way out but one step at a time.
4.Weight is your enemy. And too much can be a real danger in difficult 
situations
5.One slight misstep can be a disaster and possibly the ""end"" of the trail 
or me
6.The views are incredible and very few get to see them cause the journey 
towards them       is long and hard at least for me.
7. I would like to see that section again when the Rhododendrum and mountain 
laurel are in bloom
8. Seeing another face or hearing far away voices while in the midst of 
discouragement can really lift your spirits.
9.What it feels like to be really alone.
10.There's no place like home
11. The hike was long and hard but having the weather clear, dry and 
reasonably warm was a plus and the opposite would have made it much much longer and 
harder
12. This is dangerous and I found myself a few times in very precarious 
situations. 
13. The hiking community I met is warm and willling to share the knowledge I 
so desperately need.
14.The thought of food can really boost your motivation near the end.
15 A real respect for anyone who has done any part of the trail and 
downright awe for those who have done it thru.
16. THE TRAIL DEMANDS RESPECT FROM ALL THOSE WHO STEP FOOT ON IT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------",,THINGS I LEARNED,"Jan 25, Tue",0
little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/87062,"Well I had my first taste of the trail a couple weeks ago. Met some really great people who had a lot of trail wisdom to impart and even helped with a little tuckering of my pack. Tuckering is when someone more experienced in lightweight hiking goes through your pack and eliminates extra weight by getting rid of extraneous and useless gear. They got rid of around 7 lbs from mine just by packing things differntly and taking out the extra weight in unnecesary items. They also suggested I get another lighter tent since the one I have adds 6.5 lbs to my pack. I could elimiinate about 3 lbs by getting another smaller 1 person tent. That's a total of around 10 lbs weight shaved off. That way I could add food and water and still only have a full pack weigh in at around 25lbs. winter weight. When I switch to warmer weather gear that would go down significantly.This is the range I was shooting for. 
As of today with my original plan there is only 66 days left. If you caught the title to this entry you can pretty much tell where I am at this point. Do I or Don't I? You notice that I don't say could I or couldn't I? It's not a matter really of whether I can or not thru hike the AT. Most people who are even remotely healthy and have a strong will and determination and the time could do this thing either all at once or in sections. For some it might take 4-5 months others 6-7 months and longer. I've realized it's not a race or a fixed time activity but one that should be done in such a way as to glean the most from the time spent...whether 1week, 1month, or 5-6 months. Now my thoughts are not so much to do a one time thru hike but maybe a many sectioned hike from GA-ME.
My original thought is to do a straight 6 month thru hike. As I was hiking recently on that small 7.5 mile section of the AT in GA my thoughts progressed like this...
1. Maybe I should do this thing as many sections and doing each one when that particular section is at its most beautiful.I was walking at the time thru a section that would be filled with flowering rhododendrums and mountain laurels if hiked in late spring and summer. Then of course there is the changing of the leaves in New England in early fall late summer. I could also pick the times when the weather would be best to..not too hot or cold.And then there's the bug and fly thing to. I'm not a martyr for this thing I just want to enjoy the wilderness experience. At this point I still was really planning a long distance hike but probably slower, starting later and maybe doing the whole trail in 2-3 sections.
2. As I continued on the hike the experience was more difficult and dangerous in places than I would like but I met the challenge and pressed on.This of course is one of my main objectives for attempting the hike...to really stretch my boundaries. I think I did this even if just in small ways. There was noone out there but me and the trail and the only one that got me home was myself. At this point I started considering my husband and how hard it would be to be away from each other for such an extended period of time.My thoughts now were to do several small section hikes of a couple weeks at a time. This would take several years to finish the whole trail. But like I said before the main objective is to enjoy the trail and have the best possible experience. This of course would eliminate a lot of the stress with fighting for a specific completion time.
3.As a progressed on and the terrain grew more difficult to go over and every step on the downs was met with great pain in my left knee my whole mind set began to break down. Now the conversation in my head was that I didn't want to ever see a bit of wilderness again for the rest of my life. My whole prayer at this time was just to get me home before dark because I was so so not prepared for any kind of overnight stay in the woods. Whoever called this fun or even necessary in life was a damn fool. I was never so relieved to see the final bridge to get to camp.I was determined never never to set foot on this trail or any trail for the rest of my life.And these feelings and thoughts were perfectly normal and expected considering the experience I just had.
The main reason for this long dialogue was to show one thing. When I returned to camp I just got a bite to eat and went to bed avoiding all the others( I had it in my mind I was never going to see any of these people or anybody like them ever again!) Next morning I got up and packed and was ready to go hoping my ride wanted to go back really early. But nooo... we ate breakfast and then he insisted on my getting my pack tuckered.I mean he really insisted loudly. Anyway while I was doing all that and getting into the conversations again with these really great hiker people the excitement started growing again for doing a hike.On the ride back to the airport I realized my biggest mistake was to bite off so much trail in one sitting especially for the first course. If I was doing it from the beginning and on my own I surely would take a much smaller bite. I probably would have stopped at the first opportunity when my knee started giving me problems.Instead of 7.5 miles to do 3-4 til I was used to it. This was not possible at the time and I really had to do the whole 7.5 since no other alternative was open to me at the time.I even had the realization that even if somebody came out to find me (since I was taking such a loooooong time to get back)I still would have had to walk out on my own steam and strength. Never was there at any time the possibility of getting lost since the trail is blazed very clearly and easily followed. But I had no flashlight(stupid me, who would think I might need it starting out at 8:30in the AM)and there would be no way to find my way in the dark.This was the real danger at the end.SOme of the places I walked that day a slight misstep in the wrong direction and you would be walking on air with several thousand feet drop under you. Good preparation and knowing your limits and not stretching them too much are two good rules to go by on the AT or any trail.
4. Well right now I really don't know where I am. Everytime I think of going out there I get a sinking feeling in my innereds. Fear really. Fear of what you say? Fear of being alone out there. Fear of the difficulty in every step. And what fun is there in something if whenever you think of it a ball of fear 
rises up and your heart starts to palpitate. And to make the decision not to go would really lift the oppressed cloud of burden off my heart.What a relief. .......and how easy & safe that would be to do. 
5. This is where the rubber will start to hit the road. Staying where it's easy and safe has been my way of life my MO for 25 years. The more I consider the more I realize I must get back on the trail. Starting at Springer .... maybe early MAY and go for as long as I can til my daughter's grad around May 20th. After that we'll see. To do a total thru hike is really not an issue for me anymore. GA-ME at one time is not something I must prove to myself and especially not to anyone else either. I really don't think it's even feasible for me at this time.To hike the whole trail even in small portions at a time to finish in small and medium steps not in one giant step will still be the completion of a dream for me.
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF DO I OR DON'T I BUT OF WHEN? The answer? It may be as soon as 67 days.

I'm still on track for April..60 days and counting. I had an experience recently that was scary and made me think this was impossible for me.I actually hiked a few miles on the AT and had a discouraging time. But I've been making a chart of the distances between shelters, campsites and other lodgings along the Trail and most distances are under 10 miles and even some 5miles or less.This may seem a silly thing to do but it brought the whole thing back into perspective for me. This is not a race or any kind of competition. I just have a desire to do the AT GA-ME. If this takes me 5mos, 6 mos or 20 months that's OK.If I do it all at once or in several smaller sections that's OK too. I am starting my own hike and will finish my hike in my own way. When I was discouraged I was looking for any excuse to throw in the towel.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/89934,"Hey Hey Hey readers
Two weeks from tomorrow I leave for ATL. Start date 4/3/05 from Springer. Be still my heart. I am fearfully excited. Times a ticking, I'm reading the journals of those already on the trail and I say to myself..."" OMG that will be you in a couple weeks."" My ""to do"" list has narrowed considerably and is down to a few last minute details. Those things include getting a pair of convertable pants, some parachute line, and seal my tent seams. I'm also debating whether I should get a different cooking kit since the one I have is tall & narrow. The short and wider type might boil the water faster. I also need to gather my beginning food and also pack my bounce box with the extra food, town clothes and extra supplies that I replenish as I go along.The more I tweak my pack weight the bigger my bounce box gets.
   Just in case some don't know what a bounce box is: it's a box of supplies, etc that you ""bounce"" from town to town. This can lighten your pack and save $. Of course you have to mail the box so that might decrease the amount of $ saved. I'm keeping my ""town clothes"" in there and some specialty foods I like to use and other replenishable supplies like TP, baby wipes, blister supplies and other personal items. I'm not going to use food drops and will buy as needed(and available). If I want something specific I will let someone at home know and they can send it to me at the next town. Besides I'm hoping to drop a few lbs.
    I just spent 6 days in Phila area(death in family) and took some time for a couple day hikes...small just 6 miles and 4 miles but at least I got in some ups and down and even had a go at the PA rocks. But Brrrr was it cold especially when the wind kicked up. I was prepred though...clothingwise and even had a day pack with about 15 lbs. A couple members of my family up there are pretty excited about my trek. They are pretty much into hiking ...the AT(sections), Alaska, Kenya,and various sized hikes in other parts of N America. This was news to me so we had a great time talking about their experiences.
I recently got a new tent...Eureka Spitfire... great , easy set up and very roomy. AND BEST OF ALL took 3 lbs off my pack weight. It is now down to about 15 w/o food and water. I'm pretty happy about that since I wanted to keep my pack aroud 25lbs. As the weather warms up that will even get lighter.
My initial trek out is planning to be for six weeks. O lord get me thru the first 6 minutes, 6 hours, 6 days and hopefully 6 weeks. One step at a time, one day at a time. No expectations just wonderful anticipation. From Apr 3rd to around May 18. Then my daughter is graduating from University in San Diego and I'll head out there for a few days then back to the trail. I shouldn't be gone for more than a week. I don't want to get too soft and have to ""reaquaint"" my legs and rest of my body to the ""trail life""
Well that's about it for now. A special thank you to all who have signed my journal or written E mail.Your words of encouragement and advice are most appreciated. And a special, special thank you to Chilly Willy for all her special encouragment and much needed Two cents about gear, hostels etc. Hope her trek this year goes as planned. Til next time...

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/91300,"48 hours from now I will be in Blue Ridge, GA at a friend's cabin. Approx 72 hours from then I will be steppin on the Appalachian Trail alone with ne're a family or friend for comfort.I'm counting on getting a new family and making many new friends even if just for a short while. I begin the culmination of 2 years research and gear buying and gleaning all I could from other hikers on the web and elsewhere. Trying on clothes, breaking in shoes, packing it all in and then taking it all out to rearrange weight loads.Going thru each item and asking do I really need to haul that up and down the mountain tops? Discarding some and keeping others.Trying to convince my family that they will do just fine w/o me. Trying to convince myself that being w/o them won't be as bad as it seems. Hoping my dog still loves me, or remembers me, when I return. Anticipating the journey but fearful as the time draws near to begin. A butterfly stampede is in me right now and I'm doing my best to quiet the beast. 
I've arranged for a shuttle to the trailhead and my hair is so short right now I saw divorce in my husband's eyes for the first time in 30 years. He said it makes me look 10 years older and at my age that's not a good thing. Oh well...good thing about hair is that it grows back in time.I've mailed out my bounce box to the first destination and have prepared a list of mail drops written here up thru Erwin, TN. I'll be going off for a week then for my daughter's graduation from San Diego State Univ. But will return and move northward again from Erwin.
I want to thank all of you who have taken the time to read my journal and write me a little note of encouragement or advice thru the past months. They were all received with a grateful heart. I am planning to keep my journal updated as the opportunity arrives thru public libraries and other internet access available.
My next entry will be from the trail and thank you again for all your care and encouragement.
We are never too old to dream the dreams of our heart.No matter where you are or what you are doing may you never shrink back from acheiving what is important to your heart but always be moving forward towards your dreams. For where your treasure is there will your heart be also.
I also thank my family, especially my husband, Steve, for allowing me this opportunity to grow and pursue the dream. For 30 years we have grown together in faith and in love. We have danced to the same tune and sung the same songs Thank you for this opportunity to dance to the music in my heart.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/91914,It's 9:00PM and I made it to the hostel this afternoon around 5:30pm. Several other hikers around with various levels of experience. Talked about gear and other plans around dinner at a Mexican Restaurant they drive us to. Mexican or Italian were the choices. I'm a little lonely but really mostly nervous about what tomorrow will bring. Thought I'd get a few lines in since I don't know when the next time i'll have the opportunity to write. To tell you the truth I'm a little tearful and wish I was home with my husband right now. Too much time to think I guess. My biggest fear right now is getting to a place on the trail that is really difficult and not being able to go on physically. What have I gotten myself into???? Dancin free,"Atlanta

Saved the knees for sure. The plaques are there at Springer. Signed the registry took a few pictures and off up the trail we went. I say ""we"" because I met a nice couple from Michigan who started same day as me. In fact they also were picked up at the Marta same time with me. The airlines had lost their packs but finally found them the next day. I would have been freaken if that had happened to me. They were the same age as me maybe a little older, married a few years less than me...but they were real troopers. We stayed together for a while but afterwards I couldn't even see their dust. I trudged into Hawks Shelter about 5:15PM. Has a privy and a great little stream for water source. Ice cold soaked my feet for a few minutes... haaaaaaa. Got water and purified it right away. Pitched the tent at a nice site...it was beautiful weather. A few minutes later Mike and Ruth(couple from Michigan) came and were so happy to see me and I them.Too tired to cook so went over to to their campsite and just finished off the trail mix and beef jerky I had been snackin on all day. Signed the registry and hung my food bag on the cables provided at the shelter. Real easy set up. Did a little ""toilette"" in the tent and settled in for the night. Woke up several times during the night kept hearing a sound like a scratching outside the tent. Thought it was some animal but finally realized it was just the wind blowing thru the tent fly.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/92662,"You're probably confused about the start and destination but what a day I had!!!Woke up early after a restless night, (getting used to the tent and trying to keep warm) greeted by a beautiful sunrise right ourside my tent, ate a little breakfast(Esbit stove works great) met a few of the other hikers finishing breakfast also. In particular was a grandpa with his four grandsons(ages 16-12). We started talking and he said he had talked it over with their school teachers and the teachers agreed to let him withdraw them to go on a thru hike of the AT. I made a comment that they seemed to be enjoying themselves. His reply was ""it was only the 2nd day"". I was enjoying my self also but then it was only my first day...what an eye-opening 2nd day I had.
I packed up camp and traveled on down the trail with a final destination planned at Justus Creek. I was told this was a beautiful place to camp and with a total of only around 6 miles it seemed a logical resting place for the day. I had done around 8.5 the day before and it was a little too much so I thought this would be a better mileage for today. Boy was I wrong. First thing I have learned is that the number of miles does not make a hike easy or hard. The AT is all about the TERRAIN. Six miles in FLORIDA is not the same as 6 miles on the AT especially between Hawk's Mt and Justus Creek. Between these two points is a ""little"" matter called SASSAFRASS MOUNTAIN. 
I left camp at 8:30AM and came down off of Sassafrass Mt into Cooper Gap at around 3:00. Just in case you don't know, that is a total of 5 miles. That's 6.5 hours to go 5 miles!! I wasn't sore or hurting in any way but I was just very, very beat. I realized I was either very naive or just plain ignorant of the type of terrain that makes up the AT in GA. I don't know if this is how the whole thing is( some are even worse I'm sure)but coming down off that mountain was a real piece of work. 
On a more positive note(haha) I must say a special thank you at this point to a hiker named BUZZSAW. He showed me the rest step and I must say that this enabled me to go up at a reasonable rate and without the gasping breaths of the day before.( Ask another Hiker to explain it to you, it will surely be your lifesaver to). 
Now back to the ordeal... coming down off of Sassafrass I had my plan all figured out. I'M OUTTA HERE...BACK TO FLORIDA TOMORROW!!! 2nd day and ready to say goodbye to the whole lot of things. I called Josh from the Hostel and he said it would be around 2 1/2 hours before he could pick me up...my reply was I didn't care if it was 10:00 at night I would be sitting here.
While I was waiting the grandpa and his grandkids came down and I took a picture of them all. Also another young hiker came down and I gave him the rest of my water and my beef jerky since I would not need them ever again. If the opportunity had arisen I would have given my whole pack and gear away at just that moment. Because I wouldn't need them ever again...I wanted no part of hiking ever again. Most people reading this are probably thinking ""OK Marietta let's not go overboard it can't have been that bad"". You would be thing this for two reasons. One, you are as naive and ignorant about the trail as I was or two you are already familar with the Trail and it is old hat to you. I am a Florida flatland woman and this terrain is absolutely ridiculous to me. It is also unfathomable to me that some people enjoy what I went thru today and will do it again and again and still enjoy it.
On the ride back to the hostel I got the usual speech and encouraging words,""takes a couple weeks to get your trail legs...you'll regret getting off too soon etc etc yada yada yada. I didn't want to hear it.
Got back there took a shower, cleaned up got on the Internet and started looking for a flight. Very expensive, Spoke to my daughter she was sympathetic but she really said about the same things I heard on the way back to the hostel.
There was a big crowd at the hostel that night(24) we all ordered pizza and there was alot of ruckus and laughter and talk about the trail and everything that everyone had done and I started feeling a little better. Of course I heard the same things over and over take a day off and decide then about the trail. So I started asking a few of the more experienced hikers about the next leg over Justus Mt and over to Hawk's Mt Shelter. Being around all the hikers, old and young...experienced and newbies. There was also a few that were just arriving and hearing their excitement about beginning the next day. It was all becoming quite palatable and catching and I began to consider going on. I finally decided to take a zero day tomorrow and get back on again and try the next leg.
One more thought for today is I realized a VERY big part about this AT hike thing is the PEOPLE. Hostel owners , shuttle runners, all the other hikers all combine into a little community. A little community to keep the community moving along. But one thing is still true...there is a large band of support here but it's still you that carries your pack and must put one foot in front of the other to move your small part of the community forward. The key for me right now is deciding if the effort is worth all the hardship.
PS: My husband was not very happy that after all the $$$ spent and effort put into all this that I was contemplating coming home after 2 days. The original plan was for a 6 week leg.","Hawk's Mountain Shelter

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/92723,"Took a zero today. Actually the morning weather is beautiful( watching the weather is a big part of everything) Sunny, cool. Rain expected for tomorrow. A few minutes before the AM shuttle came I decided I might ""slack pack"" today for the next leg but was too late to get ready. See how my attitude has changed since yesterday.I stayed around the hostel today, did laundry, cleaned up my gear, took a Walmart run with a couple others. I had Paul tucker my pack a bit and took a little weight off. 29 lbs with 4 days food and 2L water. He also fitted my pack better and showed me how to pull the straps to tighten the pack around me. It was a more comfortable fit and took the weight off my back. He also explained how to pack it to distribute the weight. This also helped stabilize the pack to my body. All in all by the end of the day I was feeling pretty positive about taking the next leg to Hawk Mt shelter. Today was a help but had not moved me forward in the journey. Actually right now writing this I realize that coming to the decision to continue on was a moving foward for me.    Thunderstorms predicted for tonight and tomorrow.","AT Hostel

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/92725,Thunderstorms were predicted for last night and today. Still clear and dry when we got up. Great sunrise right outside the front door. Great home cooked breakfast then off to the trail. Dropped off at Cooper Gap around 8:30Am...Still dry as I head up Justus Mountain accompanied by my usual morning stomach nervousness and slight nausea. As mentioned in an earlier entry doing the rest step has greatly increased my uphill with little to no gasping. Started raining not too long afterwards... pulled up my hood and was dry and warm. Around 11:00 Met a young hiker from CT coming down into Justus Creek( Justus Mt not too bad even in the rain) He said not much sleep last night since Army Rangers were out on maneuvers and camped practically right outside his tent. Continued on in the rain. I wasn't bothered by the rain... there was no wind or thunder or lightning so not too bad. Kept dry and warm. Also I had gators on so even though I was trudging thru muck my socks and bottoms of my pants kept clean. Got into Gooch Shelter around 2:30. Figured I'd just eat a little something and move on. Feeling pretty good but thought a hot meal would be warming and strengthening. A few people were already there incl the young man from CT. and another couple. The rain started coming down in earnest as we were fixing our meals and we all kinda decided to stick around here for the night. Nice shelter with the all important PRIVY(haha) and a wonderful stream for water. With all the rain it was flowing pretty good and ice cold.Tasted great...after treating of course. In the next couple hours more hikers kept coming in. We had a total of 15 in the shelter and there was still some tenting and even one UNDER the shelter. I didn't get to meet thase who tented but most in the shelter were young people. Me and 2 others were the only ones over thirty...way over thirty. Around 6:00pm the storms started rolling in. The winds picked up and the rain came pouring down with the thunder and lightning . Gusts seemed around 40-50 miles an hour. Everyone started to scramble for the things they had hung up to dry earlier. I was already snug in my sleeping bag warm and dry. None of my gear had gotten wet really except my pack cover. Even my socks were dry and my pants had already dried. After dinner and a break in the rain everyone hung their food bags and sat around talking. Around 8 I made my final privy run and settled down for the night. Rain with thunder & lightning continued off and on thru the night Once again I must say it was the people around that made the experience special. I didn't enter into the banter too much but just being there was a comfortable situation in spite of the weather.  A note on gear: most of the hikers there had the inflatable Thermarest mattress and sure did look more comfortable then my Z Rest. I'll eventually get one because this Z is not cutting it for comfort on these middle aged bones(haha). Baby wipes have also been great for quick freshen ups and privy trips.,"AT Hiker Hostel

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/92726,"Didn't sleep well, packed in and afraid I'd roll over on someone but finally got up around 7AM. Ran to the privy and came back and started packing up . Had a little oatmeal for breakfast. Wrapped my food bag in a garbage bag since it was now soaking wet from the rain...food was dry though thanks to the infamous Ziploc bags. 8:15am - Set out for the day to a clear sky but still had my trusty gators on cause the trail was very mucky and wet. Hike was good today lots of ridge walking and beautiful views in spite of the lingering fog. Small ups and downs and finally got to Woody Gap around 12:15. Made the decision earlier if I made it in time I would take Pittsburg's shuttle(he comes around 12:40pm) back to the Hostel for the night. Seems I can't stand more that 2 days of stink on me. Made it on time and was back at the Hostel by 1PM. After a shower and clean clothes I felt like a new woman. Big crowd tonight. went to town for dinner...Italian... all you can eat spaghetti. When everyone was ordering seconds I said I was fine I'm just a ""little hiker"". A couple of them said that sounded like a trail name for sure. I'll keep the name Dancin Free for the journal but after today I'll always see myself as Little Hiker. Compared to some of these guys I'm really a baby in the hiking community. I had the opportunity to meet and talk to Mickey One Sock. Thanks One Sock for all the encouraging words. Looking forward to a good nights sleep and onward tomorrow.Note: I'm was surprised the first night at Hawk's Mt. that there was cell phone reception. This allowed me to talk to my family and hear a familiar voice. Each time also back at the Hostel I've also been able to reconnect to the familiar voices of my family. But writing this right now I don't know if this has really been profitable to me. By keeping in touch so frequently has not allowed me to fully detach myself from the support system and yet may be keeping the feelings of detachment from the familiar from decreasing. I know that sounds strange but it's like the boat has put out to sea but still attached to the shore by a very very long anchor line. Away from the shore but still attached to the shore.","Gooch Gap Shelter

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/92729,"CLear weather greeted us as I was dropped off at Woody Gap and started on the day's journey. I had one mountain today and then the climb to Blood Mountain. The original plan was just to go to Wood's Hole SHelter but when I got there it was so far off the trail I just got water and continued on...pushing for the Blood Mountain SHelter. I had heard this was a very old shelter one of the originals and not very hospitable to stay in. I also had heard that the trek down off of Blood Mountain was very difficult and decided it would be better to try and do that on fresh legs and a rested and fully fuelled body. Trek up was LONG!! But once again the rest step came to my rescue. When I finally arrived at the shelter at around 5pm I discovered it was everything I heard it was. OLD, MOLDY, DRAFTY. The views were beautiful and there was a new privy. Trouble was the privy was about a fifteen minute trek back down south and there was NO WATER on top. Water source almost a mile south and must remember to get it on the way up. There were a few tenters and only one other hiker in the shelter. I didn't know there were any tent sites since the whole place looked like one big ROCK. Not a rock pile but one solid ROCK. So it was after I had settled into the shelter that I discovered there were tenters and tent sites.Aftera while a few young people came rock climbed around and finally were called back to their camp south of the shelter. Another man arrived with photo equip. He trekked all the way up from the north side just to get pictures of the sunset. The fog started rolling in and the opportunity for sunset shots was rapidly decreasing. The big fiery ball finally descended into the horizon with quite a show of red flame sky. Quite spectacular.As I settled in for the night my only worries were for mice antics and the infamous skunk that habitates this shelter quite frequently. Huddled in my bag I had the usual night's sleep of frequent awakenings to change positions and around 5am or so I did feel the small pitterpatter of feet on my bag and made an immediate swipe at them and had no further problem May have been my imagination or may have been critters but I was not taking any chances.Around 6:30 a group of young people began to arrive , the same from the night before. Found out they were a scout troop with their leaders out for training hikes for a backcountry experience they had planned out West. They had come to have breakfast on the summit and to watch the sunrise. Again the sun gave quite a show with another fiery display. All the kids scrambled to the top of the rocks to take pictures. I got a few on the way down to the privy.
Ate breakfast..packed up and headed down the trail around 8:45am.
I knew the way down was going to be difficult but this was absolutely ridiculous. This was not hiking but rock scrambling and climbing. 99% of the first 45 min was on shear rock. The blazes were even on the rock since there were no trees. Several places I felt my life was actually in danger with just one small misstep. That was the reason I crept down that mountain step by step. Eventually the rocks turned into more dirt and the trail became just rocky steps and mud. There was a water source and a campsite about half way down and I planned to take a break there and replenish my water supply.
I had made a reservation at Walasi Yi Center for a cabin tonight and looking forward to a leisurely afternoon & evening there after picking up my first maildrop. Well I walked on and on and finally started to hear signs of civilization...cars and trucks and motorcycles roaring up and down the highway. Seems I had missed the campsite and had made the entire way down by 11:40am. Made it over to the Center and realized Pittsburg was due in to shuttle back to the Hostel in about 25 min. I made a quick decision to go back to the Hostel. Found the hiker that was at the shelter last night, BP, and he had decided also to go to the Hostel. Picked up my maildrop and bought a few drinks and icecream and made it outside just in time to catch Pittsburg going thru the parking lot. So here I am back at the Hostel...again. And have made the following decisions:
1. I am not mentally prepared for the Trail at this time. Physically I know I am getting stronger but do not want to waste time by getting off the trail every other day just to get back to civilization and a bath. I do not feel as if I am moving forward but taking a break out of the race every other day just to relax and recoup. Of course everyone says this is normal but I feel as if I'm in some kind of vacation mode with all the restaurant meals etc of the Hostel atmosphere. I am nauseaus in the AM when contemplating the Trail and have had few and far between times of joy. This is not what I came out here for. 
2. I am ready to go home but I also realize I will return and I will finish the Trail albeit in sections.
3. I do not feel like a failure and I would hope noone would see me as such.I have completed the trail from Springer Mountain to Neels Gap and have conquered Sassafrass Mountain & Blood Mountain, the tallest mountain on the trail in Ga at close to 4500 feet of elevation. I came out here and have overcome many physical and mental challenges by myself. The terrain of the trail is unbelievably rugged and cannot be explained or understood except by those who have actually experienced it. I have finished the first part of my journey and am ready to go home.
4. Besides the physical conditioning the most time consuming thing involved with preparing for a hike of this caliber is the gear. I will make gear reviews on the gear part of my journal. I will not take the space to do that here. I have the gear now and even have learned better types of gear and will make some changes before I return. And I will return... and I will finish the journey!","Woody Gap

I needed that name to get me to the Trail. Now that I have met the Trail face to face I have realized that name is an arrogant assumption on my part of who I am ON the Trail.It's not a matter of dancin free up and down the Trail but of being molded to what is needed to get up and walk on it each day. The Trail made me feel small but at the end of each ""good"" day I felt stronger for having met the days challenge.  I leave the Trail today not as a defeated hiker but as a ""little hiker"" During the past week or so I have had the privelege of meeting some ""grandfather"" hikers. Those who have not only Thru hiked the whole trail but some have done it several times. Others I have met have done the Trail year after year in small sections and have finished the course. My appetite for the Trail is small but it's there. My ability to meet the challenge is small at this time but it is there.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/96232,"I've been off the trail now for about 3 weeks and inwardly there are lots of conflicting thoughts. And they all come to one conclusion...I need to get back on the trail. There's such a large sense of unfinished business that it's hard to explain. Not that I had the expectation of doing the whole trail that first time out but I did think I would make it more than a single week. I'm pretty disappointed with myself and they're not saying too much but I feel my family is a little let down also. I don't actually feel like I failed but I really am a wimpy wus. On the one hand I feel that I stretched a little bit my boundaries but on the other hand I feel like my boat never even left the harbor 
    I have to make a couple of gear adjustments. I want to get a better sleeping pad, leave out some of the winter clothes and maybe get a larger sleeping bag since the one I have was a little constricting(but that is not really a definite .I could manage with the one I have). 
But... I must get back on the trail. I have looked over the maps and have planned to at least get through the Smokies(Davenport Gap) from Neel's Gap( that's where I got off) It's about 130 miles and I feel I need to just go back on and just stay til I do those 130 miles.
Anyways... It's between me and myself now...actually me and the trail. It's waiting and I'm coming. Coming to be enveloped and to rest in the day to day walk thru the timelessness that is THE TRAIL.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/131777,"This time next year... that's my plan. April 2,2007 from Neels Gap to ? I made this decision about a month ago and am in the ongoing process of preparation. Ever since I came off the Trail in April of '05 always, always in the back of my mind there is the still small voice of the trail calling me back. From what I read in journals it is the same way with most people who have been on the trail and even for those who have completed a Thru. To me that voice speaks of unfinished business and to finish that business I must prepare myself more efficiently to meet the challenge. Even though I was only on for a little over a week I have a clearer picture as to what the trail demands day to day. Before I was not in adequate physical conditioning and was overweight. Of course if I had persevered with the journey those two things would have been greatly adjusted but ALAS the wimp in me won out. But I do not dwell on the past but look forward to future days of ups and downs.       As of now I have placed myself on a weight loss and exercise routine as a beginning. As I get more in shape I will continue will strength training and conditioning. I have no doubt that I will acheive my goals since the call to return is in my heart and this I cannot ignore. For the past year whenever that voice would raise itself above the usual whisper I would always tell myself that it really doen't matter if I ever go back or I can wait a few years to try again. But I can't, that voice won't let me. I must prepare and go on.       We were in TN in March in the Smokies and did a couple of day hikes. It really felt good to be back in the woods again. The weather was great and many hikers out. We also took a ride up to Newfound Gap and what a thrill it was to see that trail post for the AT. While we were in TN I did discover something that really surprised me...my husband liked the hiking we did. One was to rainbow Falls very spectacular and worth all the effort .We are going again in May back to The Smokies and we are planning 2-3 more day hikes since he's not really ready for the tent and shelter routine yet.        I'll be taking my gear out this weekend just to check it all out and see if I can make any adjustments. Besides...handling the gear will feed that litle voice in me and keep my eyes and heart on the journey. I'll start getting on the gear sites and see if any major lightweight marvels have come out. I ordered a daypack and hiking poles for my husband for our hikes in May and I'm sure the poles will help since he has knee problems.    Well...I just wanted to make a ""little"" entry to get the ball rolling. I'll continue to add news as I need to. I've kept up with hikers this season and pleasant trails to all with great views and companions.

It was a long ride but it's great to be back in the mountains. Got up this AM and got on the trails around 1:30PM. Went hiking to the Chimney Tops. WOW, what a work out. 1700 ft elevation change in about 2 miles. The last section was basically a hand over hand rock climb. But the view was so worth the effort.Several nice waterfalls beautiful vistas with the foggy cover on the mountains. Silly me alot of the time as I was going up up up I was comforting myself that coming down would be a breeze. NOT.But it was slightly less strenuous. Was I glad I had my hiking poles though. Got back to the car around 5:30.I was never so happy to see that blue Toyota. O yes I forgot to mention it also rained and hailed while we were coming down I had rain gear though so I was at least warm. Took a day pack with a few essentials (rain gear,snacks,water,hat,first aid and long sleeve fleece shirt) but still weighed in at around 12 lbs. Anyways no blisters but a few sore muscles.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537452,"The saying goes ""Life's a Journey"" Never compare yourself to others because we all have our own journey to travel. But sometimes well most of the time I feel I am traveling rudderless down a river, across the ocean,or sometimes a trickling creek. I really am a master planner. I research everything to the nth degree. Quilting: but never actually sew two pieces of material together; container gardening: but never plant a single plant or seed; home decor/projects but never do any of it. I cut out and print literally thousands of recipes and only actually cook about 1 out of 100. The AT is no different. Researched, planned, bought gear and in 2 attempts I have only spent an actual 6 days on the trail. First time I was in GA for a week made it to Walasi but 4 of the nights I stayed at the Hostel. I can't even remember now why I left...Woosed out I guess. Second time(started again at Springer)... are you ready for this...one day. I got violently sick the first night out. Left most of my gear on the mountain. SO VERY SORRY LNT was not even in my vocabulary as I puked my way down the mountain for a ride to a motel. It lasted about three days. I bought a ticket home when it felt like it was letting up and the world stopped spinning.My friend drove from TN to pick me up and took me to the ATLANTA airport. BAM that was it. I cant even remember how many years ago that was. 3-5 I think. Then I was planning on getting on in April of this year but all of a sudden I got this big epiphany about my bucket list(I'm 63 this year). Let's knock several things off and THEN I'll get to the AT. It's all in the journal here. It's like I put off really preparing translate that exercise and losing weight til its too late than I find all these great reasons why I should just go NEXT year. PATHETIC! But I can't let it go. Always in the back of my mind, deep in my heart the feeling of unfinished business haunts me.
I've been reading some journals the past couple weeks and the stirring is happening again. I realize more and more each day that my window is shrinking to renew the AT dream and gettin' to it.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539838,"As the title suggests I am now pondering the way to record this momentous journey I am undertaking. Of course at the very least I will record my daily/weekly wanderings here on Trail Journals along with pictures. But in spending time on You Tube watching so many videos I have become quite intrigued with the process of all that. I would really like to make videos daily or maybe a couple times a week of my meanderings, people I meet, and just to record for family and friends the environment I find myself in day to day and my thoughts on it.TO do all this I realize much research is needed on my part since I would like the quality to be good in the videos and/or the pictures also. I don't want this once in my lifetime experience to go by without a permanent record of the ups and downs, smiles and tears that make up a thru hikers daily routine and the people I meet if even for just an evening at a shelter or town time.In choosing which equipment will accomplish all this several criteria will be considered: Weight, cost, ease of use, and quality of end result will all be weighed in when making the final decision. I am not an Einstein when it comes to electronics but there are all levels of technical equipment out there and I am sure I can find one that even I can use with some expertise to produce quality pictures and/or videos.I want the easiest, least technical, weight-conscious, reasonably priced set up I can find. Not asking for much am I? Give me a SHOUT OUT with any and all suggestions and positive and negative experiences you have had with your equipment. I am willing to make a small sacrifice of weight if quality,ease of use, and the end results are reasonable.

little hiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540902,"Well I went to register my thru hike on the ATC website. According to them there are no openings starting at Springer from Jan 2017 til Nov 2017 except a flip flop from somewhere other than Harper's Ferry. That's a bunch of bullcrap. I don't believe that. I don't believe that every single one of those dates has multiple thru hikers starting ...every single day for every single month from Jan to Nov. SO what's the deal ATC? I guess I can start Dec 2016 or Nov 2017. Yeah right. I could also start 2018. Yeah right. I could slack pack the entire state of GA...a possibility. OR I could just start at Springer whenever,March or April and just tread lightly, leave no trace, get in to the shelters early and go with the flow. Those last 2 possibilities are my best bets.

We all need encouragement even if we haven't started yet..Hope everyone's prep is going as scheduled. We all need to keep our eyes on the goal.So much of my life I have been on the sidelines, standing against the wall, waiting for tomorrow to come,for that to be done, for this one to grow up, to get thin, to get stronger. All the laziness and fear and excuses have kept me from so many wonderful experiences.Which now are coming back to haunt me in the form of regret. At 63 the realization that time is not limitless is beginning to knock at my door. Ever so lightly but I still hear it. There will not always be tomorrow. I've had the dream of a thru for many years. Now I want the memories a thru hike will give me. From Springer to that most hallowed of Mountains, Katahdin.

If you happen to recognize them please comment on the author and I will edit to give credit.
