Packed up and hiked in light rain off and on this morning. Mountains are definitely my opportunity for improvement. Hiking up and down bleachers at OBU in Shawnee, Oklahoma is not quite the same as hiking up,up, and up!  I love hiking down but as soon as I get down, yep, I go up again!  Now I am in an eco cabin at Barefoot Hotels near Dahlonega, eating pizza and having my laundry done.

The day started out like the weather was going to be ideal but that changed quickly to extreme winds and cold. Met many happy hikers today. Hop A Long was an inspiration with his happy, positive attitude. Shared my shuttle with an amazing lady who is taking some time to evaluate whether she has accomplished her goal of being on the AT. Wishing her all the best. I saw a few hikers who were really struggling with heavy packs and trail expectations. What I took from today is that everyone out here has a goal and Katahdin is not the goal for everyone. Losing weight seems to be a goal for many but; just saying, I think there might be easier ways to lose that weight!!!!  I am loving this journey. Thanks for following me folks.

Weather was cool and windy. I heard and saw birds today but nothing else moving. My pack was a little uncomfortable but I think I packed it that way. Will get better the longer I try.  Saw a nice young man when I arrived at tent site. He was packing to go to the Gap. He has been on the trail a month and hikes 4 days a week and rests on Wednesday’s and weekends. He carries his bible and guitar!  I have not seen the bubble of hikers yet. I think I am in between.

Once we got to the Gap, we were treated to trail magic by a couple!  What a treat. Then it was pickup by shuttle and off to MM Inn where I am getting my laundry done. Last night was the warmest night on the trail, which made packing up quite enjoyable. There is always something to be thankful for on this journey.

Jane, I thought of your dad; Albert when climbing that hard, Rocky Mountain. When I got to the top it was too foggy to see and I did not climb the fire tower either.

He was so mighty and rocky that it made me forget everything else. Today I completed the short journey to Winding Stair Gap and Ron Haven from Baltimore Jacks Hostel was right there to pick me up. The hike was beautiful today. It is so awesome to see all these young people out here so happy and friendly. No one complains and as a former teacher, coach and trainer, we seldom see such joy from our youth. Maybe we should send all our students to the trail!  Here is what I know; each of us has a choice to be out here or not and there are many reasons to quit if that is what one is looking for. It is not easy, however nothing in life worthwhile is easy. I am where I am supposed to be and it never gets easier, so far?  Thanks for commenting on my journal.

You know the one who moves up the mountain with his little back pack and yodels until the contestant says stop?  That was what I felt like except put more weight in his little back pack and stop that darn yodeling!  The hike was winding stairs most of the day. I also saw and heard many waterfalls along the way. Just when everything seemed perfect, we needed a little sleet,snow and mostly rain and we got it!  Then the sun would come out for a while and then it would start a light rain. My hike ended today at the rock tower at Wayah Bald and the view was well worth every step. After my hike, I needed to find an outfitter and try a different shoe because my toes couldn’t breathe in the ones I had.

Perfect for hiking if one didn’t mind walking through mud and water on the path.  Hikers are so respectful of the “leave no trace” philosophy. While it would be easy to walk outside the path, no one does. We all follow the rules of staying on the path and not trying to make an easier or dryer one. We all just walk right thru the mud and water. The hike today was beautiful and I am sure the views would have been had it not been too foggy to see. I saw many hikers that I have been seeing almost daily. It is interesting to leapfrog with so many hikers. All are kind and wish me “happy hiking” as I do them.  I am glad to be sleeping at the hostel tonight so that I am dry and warm. Had a meal with a couple I met a week or so ago. I hope to go through the Smokies with them but will need to take off a few days as they are behind me. That also amazes me about the trail; we may all be staying in a town but we are days apart on the trail. I am taking my time and trying to remain injury free.

I worked at slowing down so that my breathing was better regulated. It did feel better but I kept trying to go faster!  Downhills were a scramble today. Many big rocks and boulders to pick my way through. I also saw where that devestating fire had scarred the earth. Vegetation was just starting to come back on each side of the trail. Had a nice view of the NOC about .4 of a mile before I got there. This is really a recreation paradise. It is amazing to me all the beauty that we never know about unless we get up and get moving. There is something so peaceful about being on the trail all alone. I see other hikers in passing ( usually they are passing me). The only ones I pass are taking a rest. LOL. I have yet to feel lonely nor afraid since I have been on this journey. I don’t want to give the impression that this is “a walk in the woods”. This is a difficult journey my friends.

The hick was pretty high elevation and had quite a few rock scrambles but then it would be smooth and soothing. There is something so fulfilling to be all alone in these mountains. It is a peaceful time.  Cheoah Bald was very impressive and soothing. Met a thru hiker whose trailname is Forgiven. He is like me in that he is leaving it all in God’s hands. Amazing young man.

I don’t know whether they can be called boulders yet but in Bromide where I grew up, they would have been giant boulders. Getting closer to the Smokies, only seven plus miles to the entrance.

Along the way, I acquired a hiking buddy!  A young pup who did not seem to have an owner. He hiked with me for about two miles and then abandoned me for a faster hiker. When I got to the shelter, I saw him again. We had no cell service to call the number on his collar. Then at dinner I met a lady who had tried to call the number but it was disconnected. She fed him and was going to try to get him placed somewhere. It may forever be a mystery. He did seem to love hiking.  Made it to the Fontana Lodge and had a nice dinner.

No ATT service so haven’t been able to post until today. Left Fontana Lodge and entered the Smokies. Tough climb and snow covered the mountains. Near Shuckstack Tower, the wind was really blowing and the trees had icicles on them. When the wind gusted the icicles rained down on me. Pretty intense. No injuries just cold. Slept in the shelter because I was there early and shelter was not full. The rule is that you can’t pitch a tent until the shelter is full. About 30 to 40 hikers got to set up their tents.

Some of the hikers started a fire in the fireplace and that allowed us all to get warm before getting in our sleeping bags. Coldest night yet!  I was asked by some section hikers how many times I had thought about quitting. They were amazed when I told them I had not even thought about quitting.

Here is what I have learned so far; you get up every day and hike until you need to resupply your food. My legs are definitely getting stronger and sometimes I can even breathe easier on climbs. I still like downhills much better.  Shelters are a blessing when there is inclement weather but tenting on nice days is still the best. I am still doing good without hot food.

I was asked about how I “cold pack” food. First of all I am one of those people who only eat vegetarian plus seafood. I have protein bars or oatmeal for breakfast. I use a ziplock bag and add water to oats at night and have overnight oats for breakfast. For lunch I eat trail mix and cheese and a tortilla. For dinner I eat tuna, tortillas and cheddar cheese ramen noodles. I add water to ramen of a morning and when I get to camp, it is ready to eat or sometimes I just eat it like chips in my tuna. I get into a town every 3 to 4 days and eat salads and hot food. So far I do not feel deprived of anything on trail. Normally I drink coffee but not on the trail because I want to hike immediately after I wake up. For me, this is better than packing a jet boil, fuel and packaged meals. I am staying at an air b&b in Hot Springs to rest my knee. My town stays are a wonderful part of my journey too.

There was about a four mile climb from Lemon Gap up to Bluff Mountain and then it was all downhill to Garenflo Gap. Garenflo to Hot Springs is closed because of a fire near the shelter. It is still not contained so we have to use the road to get our miles. The trail was pretty easy hiking with lots of greenery. I have not seen any bears nor have I met hikers who have. I feel extremely safe on the trail. I have no fears of tenting alone but there are usually other hikers nearby. If you want company, it is there; however, if you prefer to be alone, it is quite easy.

Matriarch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594549,I finally had to admit I need to get off trail and see a specialist. Too much pain to hike right now so I am back home with an appointment on Wednesday. Everything happens for a reason.,"Roanoke,Va

Matriarch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594815,"Well I think I have hope to return to trail. ortho Doc says she can patch me up so I can return to the trail in a few weeks!  If insurance approves, I will receive gel injections for three weeks. After that I should be able to carry my pack if I cut back on miles. I may not be a thru hiker but I can come back and hike if weather and knee work out. I hope to return in early July and will start in the Shenandoahs.","Okla
