     I'm finalizing everything for the at thru hike with my son Steven.  got the gear altogether and now it's just planning menus and small misc stuff. 
     My friend Al and I did 10 miles on the buckeye trail in cuyahoga valley today. It was absolutely awesome! It got my juices flowing, lol.
      I must say I'm excited to start off next spring but at the same time a bit apprehensive, I know it will be tough. Plenty of friends supporting us though.
      I'll do another entry sometime on the Tioga State Forest hike earlier this year.","

Duo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582452,"Hi everyone, 
      Well another 2 months  to go, WOOHOO! Just got a setback, my knees started swelling up and hurting OUCH! I had to back off on my workouts, especially on my knees as I had targeted my knees for strength and conditioning. Taking some Advil and putting ice on knees once-twice a day, feeling better again. Not sure what the answer is yet. Maybe just do my strengthening on the trail with light exercise prior.
     On a more fun note, I stopped at Appalachian Outfitters in Peninsula, Ohio to look around and met one of their salespeople there  who informed me she had done AT thruhike in 2017 (trailname Chip). She is doing a series of seminars on hiking the trail, so of course I had to sign up.
     Only thing left to do now is wait n organize my 4-5 drop boxes, rest will come from Walmart n grocery stores on the way.
      Hey y'all happy training and for you who hit the trail in January and February, stay safe out there as we got some snowy weather to deal with in the next 6 weeks. Happy trails","

Just had to stop strength n conditioning on my knees due to perhaps over doing it for my age . Guess I'll concentrate more on core training n let the knees be for awhile. Ended up going to Chiropracter for adjustment that really helped, must of been in a severe twist. I can walk again without using Advil for pain. Woohoo, had me worried for a bit.We are counting down weeks now.  Just need to organize some resupply boxes, approx 4-5 is all I'm gonna do.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Thu",0

It's been a crazy last cupla weeks trying to get work schedules caught up n organized so my nephew can run the show while we are gone. One week before we leave, the plan is to leave Sunday afternoon and drive partways and be at the trailhead by noon on Monday.       Am I ready? I don't know yet, I will find out I guess. I've planned, researched, packed the backpacks, exercised and analyzed, on the analyzing part I had to quit so I don't over analyze. Am I capable of doing this? I would like to think so. JUST DO IT!        Danny, a friend of mine will be starting with us for the first cupla days, my guess he's gonna be doing his own hike (HYOH) at some point. Lol!        I'm getting some responses from friends. Here are a few of the responses: are you nuts......yep probably am! Are you taking a gun along for the bears........gun? Nope! To heavy. How about bear spray?.........hmmmm bear spray? No! All I have to do is outrun the person I'm with. Lol. Where are you going to sleep? Hmmmm, let's see I'm backpacking in a wilderness area , oh a tent that's it. The responses I like best are: oh I'm so jealous, I want to go with you, or I want to do that! I think that's awesome! And to do this with your son will be an unforgettable experience!        I had breakfast with Paul Stutzman (Apostle) trail name and Hiking Through author, to pick his brain a bit about the trail, etc. he's from the same area I'm from.          Anyway that's all for right now and probably won't post anymore till I'm on the trail.

It’s interesting to talk these hikers. I’ve met hikers from Alaska, Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Australia, New Zealand and there is somebody on the trail from South Africa and Switzerland. Approximately half of the hikers I’ve met are either 60 yrs n older or mid to low 30’s. They are a very sharing community, if you run out of food or water, they will give some. If you’re sitting somewhere taking a break they ask if everything’s ok. They share information about trail conditions, which hikers are where. If you have your shoe off checking for hotspots or taking care of blisters they will stop and offer their tape or whatever they have to help.         When you go into town lot of places have hiker boxes. When hikers come into town and have extra stuff they don’t need, they put it in the hiker box. You can look through the boxes for things you need and if you have something you don’t need put it in the box for the next guy. Feels kinda weird rummaging thru the boxes. lol         Good night all","Rest

We still pumped out 11.5 miles to low gap shelter. Happy with that even with my sore feet.         Our friend Danny who is currently hiking with us had to get a new pair of shoes as he got 4 big blisters OUCH! I found a all Primus stove and a couple of canisters of fuel in a hiker box. So I donated mine to the hiker box but I’m 2-3 # lighter now. We are now at 31# apiece with water bottles full and enough food to last 7-8 days on the trail.         Met another father/ son team out here, fathers name is Tensteps and is 66 yrs old.

      As I started up my first mountain this morning I met 2 older gentleman on the way down and they informed me they left something at the summit and to enjoy it. I will post the picture.
        Well after 2 days each of 13.6 miles up and down the mountains we are staying at the Top of Georgia Hostel tnite. Pretty neat place $30 for a bunk which are on top of each other plus you get a shower for that and all you can eat cereal breakfast with whole milk. For an additional $5 they will do your laundry. The owner is a triple crowner, he’s thru hiked the Appalachian Trail, Continental Divide Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail.
        After a hot shower and eating a whole pizza and 3 bottles of cola I’m feeling pretty good. Coming down off the mountains is always rough on my heels and Achilles’ tendons. 
         Steven said his foot hurts to much to go on at Unicoi Gap yesterday so his friends were only a couple of hrs away picked him up, gonna miss the companionship. Sent the 2 man tent home with him and slept under the stars last nite was hoping no snake shows up looking for a warm spot. Not sure what I’ll do till I get my one man tent at home, guess I’ll look for a lightweight tarp for now.
       The plan for tomorrow is to hike only 8 miles or so to put less stress on my ankles. Oh, yesterday at Unicoi Gap we left the parking lot and went up a 1000’ and went down a 1000’ and climbed another 750 before we hit camp in approx 2.3 miles. Lol it was a roller coaster.

I pulled my shoes off and did an evaluation of my feet. To many days of wet feet. Well it so happens that duct tape is the best thing for blisters and hot spots on your foot. Got it all taped up and did 2 more miles and set up a stealth camp. 
      A stealth camp is when you set up camp somewhere there is no camp site. You spread leaves and twigs back across to make it look like no one was there.

        It was hard to crawl out of sleeping bag this morning as it was the warmest night yet. Finally made it out and yes blisters still hurt. Oh well the journey must proceed and pain must be endured.
       I decided to do more mileage and see how my body responds. I aimed for a shelter at 17 miles see how everything feels. You learn to listen to your body a lot out here. If you get hungry you stop and eat, if it gets tired stop for a lil break. By the time I got to the shelter I was tired but decided  to press on. It took a bit longer for the last 3 miles but I got my first 20 miler in. Aiyiyi was I tired and feet were so sore. This morning I felt like hitting the trail again, so I’m happy the way it went.

        Was planning on hiking 15 miles to shelter but that didn’t happen as my feet took a turn for the worst. The pointy rock I stepped on must have hit my nerves as they are swelling on the on the bottom of my toe pads. So I tried compensating more on my other foot and that fired up the ankle that I was trying to be careful with. Advil not helping. Took 9 hrs to hike 10 miles. GEEZ!
        Ben and Jerry caught up with us around 2 in the afternoon and informed us that they are taking a shuttle into Erwin from Spivey Gap. I decided to go in with them and ice down my feet. As I walked into motel, Will walks into the lobby as well. He asks me if I want split a room. Yes of course I do. $25 bucks a night. 
     Will is a guy I met a few weeks ago at a hostel and he does BBQ competitions. Lol, so we did a lot of talking about BBQ. I just call him BBQ.
      Well I iced my feet down for several hours and took some pain meds so I could sleep, feels better this morning but still swollen on right foot, so more ice today. Well that’s it for The swollen feet, it goes with the territory. Taking care of feet is probably the top priority out here. 
       Well that’s it for today, just meeting a lot of new hikers and other hikers I’ve met in the past several weeks.
        An update on the forest fire in hot springs. Talked with a couple of hikers I knew said they woke up with the fire burning just on the other side of the trail they were camped on.

       Well after yesterday’s miserable day I’m still icing down feet and just trying to trying to power thru the pain.
        Ok enough of the feet story, as I have another story to tell haha. I’ve been hiking with Mary (kudzu), Joe (guiness), Rick (Ragnar), mission dan who lost his wife in January, and Ben & Jerry. Now this story concerns the  one named guiness. To start the story guiness has been struggling with the heat all week, so he’s been rolling into camp pretty late. Well that one evening he decided to hang his food bag in a y of a tree instead of limb. I still think a bear  could have climbed the tree with consequences as we found out the next morning. It was early morning still kinda dark and I was sitting in my tent thinking about where we were going to camp next. All of sudden I hear this thrashing and crashing sound thru the brush, my first thought was it’s a BEAR! Then it got quiet then some more thrashing n crashing and all of a sudden I hear this big crack and stuff breaking and thud then it got quiet. I asked if everyone ok? No one answered. Later as we found out his rope got stuck in the y when he tried to let his food bag down, to no avail. So he used another tactic by pushing the tree over, LOL! He got his food bag. Guiness my foot, more like Paul Bunyan. Y’all are awesome guys n gals. Hope to meet you on the trail again someday.

Kinda felt bad not putting on more miles.      I'm 22 miles from crossing over interstate 77 west of Wytheville, VA. I'll be crossing over VA 612. Not sure if I'll make it across tomorrow or not . We will see. the goal is Pearisburg, Va by Saturday eve or Sunday forenoon.         Saw my first Copperhead today on the trail, I took my hiking stick and nudged its tail a bit till I had its attention and then flicked  it off the trail.

I'll be posting evening before and morning pics. I had to share pics with some of the group that had camped a mile past the shelter.
         Well I hiked 21.7 miles today and my feet are sore. Had some good ups and downs. I wanted to be near Brushy Mountain Outpost to get a few resupply to get me in Pearisburg, Va. I was hoping to get there before 6 but didn't happen as I took an hr break to refuel and dry my tent from last night, as we had a heavy dew. I hiked within a 3/4 mile of the outpost and found a stealth campsite off to the side in the woods as the AT follows the road for mile and half and crosses interstate 77. I can hear the traffic from where I'm at and could see vehicles if it weren't for the trees. 
      I'm excited for breakfast in the morning, as oatmeal is usually my meager fare. They won't open till 8 so I can sleep in for a bit, WOOHOO! 
      Oh, on my way over I saw this black  snake on the trail, I'd say it was 51/2-6' it was a big one. I had to coax  it on over. It wasn't so excited to move, so I had to use the 2 hiking sticks to move it off the trail. Snakes are actually good to keep the tick populations in control, as they eat the mice that are carriers of lymes disease and the ticks on the mice. Only the deer ticks have lymes disease and are about the size of a pinhead, very hard to see. There are other diseases that can be spread by ticks also. 
         Well I must massage my feet and that has become my evening ritual. I had my towelette bath tonite in hopes I don't smell so bad that they won't let me in for resupply and breakfast, mmmmm! My knee finally quit hurting, it had a bad habit of waking me up 3-4 times a night. Just needed more training I guess :/ I'm actually getting some great sleep for a change and I can tell my daily outlook is better too.  Cyall ltr.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

It was a long uphill around 5 miles not really steep but kept going. My backpack was a bit heavy as I have 5 days worth of food to take me to Daleville for next resupply.

No coffee this week:(Lunch: 6 burritos, 5 tuna packets, I add cheezit crackers or combos for additional flavoring. Dinner: 1 Mountain house chicken noodle soup, 1 Campbell's ready to eat chicken and dumplings, 2 knorr sides of rice, 1 knorr side of Alfredo noodle thinga, 1 idohoan potatoes.Snacks: 1 box cheesit crackers, 2 bags of combos medium size, 1 bag fun size snickers, 1 box granola bars, 1 box lucky charm treat bars, 1 jack link beef jerky, 1 bag trail mix.        When I put in long miles I have to eat 4 times a day, with snacks in between. Depends how hard the climbs are too.         A little side note, I saw my first bear today. After we hiked to the top and sat down to look at the view and eat some snacks.

I’m trying to push beyond my limits of before and build up endurance and every time I have to feel the pain. To all my friends who have heard me say this: I love pain! Lol, not really though.          The hike was mostly on top of a ridge, up and down, up and down. It looks semi flat from below but I assure you it’s not. They have an occasional rock scramble thrown in the mix too. Mcafee Knob was the highlight of the hike. I’ve wanted to see this place as I’ve seen lots of pics of it and finally got there, so awesome! Next up was Tinkers Cliffs and while there a thunderstorm went through 2 mountain ranges over was pretty awesome to watch. Finally got into town around 8 pm and got a room and it’s a zero mileage day for me. Let the body heal a bit.       The hiker I took food along for made it into town, it was a big mileage day for them. I talked  to them later, they had a bit of m&ms and some other snack after their last meal at lunch. Makes it pretty rough going 6-8 hrs with no food to keep you going. I bought pizza and we had pizza last night, yep late last night.        They’re having trail days next town over and are shuttling hikers back and forth today, so I might swing over and get my pants fixed and shoes fixed up too.         Now I have to figure out how far to next resupply and get my food ready to head out tomorrow. I also need to find more food to eat as I just had breakfast and am hungry once again. It’s amazing how much food you can shovel in and in 2 hrs you’re looking for more. Reminds me when I was in my teens with a bottomless pit.        Oh hey wanted to fill you in on my stay at Niday Shelter the other night. 4 of us stayed there in the shelter due to potential rain and everybody hates packing up a wet tent and carrying the extra weight and also means you have to stop for an hr to dry it out. Anyway back to the shelter story, I woke up around 1:30 and I thought to myself something isn’t right and was laying there and trying to figure it out, then it hit me, geez I didn’t hear a single mouse so far. Usually if there’s mice there’s no snakes or vice versa. Now I got a bit concerned but not a thing I can do. A lil bit later I hear this soft thud like a small rope falling to the floor. Now I just freeze and listen and can’t hear anything, finally I fall asleep again. Well 2 days laterone of the guys was reading comments on that shelter and apparently there is a rattlesnake living under the floor of the shelter, oops! Gots to be more careful. Every time you sit on a rock or log you check the surroundings just to be safe.        Well that’s the news from the AT today. Just a lil side note: it’s amazing how keen your smell gets out here.

At least Commander and Ozzie didn't see me. :/          The little gnats flying around your eyes are very irritating, especially when one dives into your eyes.          Some ppl are seeing bears on the trail, so far I haven't seen one. Po was telling me that last eve he came on a bear on the trail. He yelled and tried to chase it off and the bear decided nope and did a face off, so he had no choice but to retreat and the bear followed him for a bit. He went back a ways to a camp site, hung his food bag and didn't eat anything for supper as he was concerned about smells. Going to bed hungry would be tough. That's all for today. Let's see what tomorrow brings.","

Just sprawled out on the sofa while posting the journal. Feels good but also a bit guilty being off the trail and all my hiker friends doing the hike.       I hiked 17 miles to South River picnic area and waited there for them to pick me up.        Along the way I almost stepped on a little rattlesnake which was laying partially on the trail. My foot was within 8 inches of it when I saw it and did a hasty step back, scared the crap out of me geez! I instantly took my trekking pole and flipped it off the trail, before I got a picture. Shucks! I’ll probaly see more especially with the hot weather moving in. A little bit more down the trail I saw a northern ringneck snake, they’re small snakes, black with a yellow band just behind its head. I wanted a picture of it and decided it wasn’t holding still and pose for one. Maybe next time.        I arrived at the picnic area and laid down for a rest till they arrived and when they did, Robby came in from behind and scared me as Stephanie did a video, lol. It was a good one.         What makes a good hiker? Well a good hiker is when they get in the vicinity of food is to strike up a conversation with the people and have them offer you food without you asking for it directly. Usually starts out with general conversation and then you steer it in the direction of food with comments like, it’s amazing how the hiker hunger works or wow, that looks or smells great or say something guess I’ll go and have my daily ration of rice and Idahoan potatoes. There are some who are really good at that. I just feel a bit to guilty to take to the next level after General conversation.        Well it’s time to do laundry and wash my backpack and sleeping bag. I’ll be hanging out here till Sunday afternoon eating real food and sleeping in a real bed, which by the way was a bit tough on the first night as I’m used to sleeping in a cooler environment, I kept waking up soaked in sweat. Finally at 2:00 am I just got up and took a lil walk to keep my sore muscles from stiffening up. Ok time to do my chores. Cya ltr.","Stealth site

Still trying to adjust to a real bed, wake up a lot during the night.         Last night Robby’s mom came over for dinner and we had big 2” steaks. Oh my we’re they delish. Also she gave me a haircut which felt pretty awesome when she was done. That was the first one since first of April sometime.         The plan today is to go to church with them for the first service and come home then they are heading back to help with the second service. They will be dropping me off this evening on the trail again and I will be meeting 3 other hikers to hike with them for 2-3 days. Then I’ll start doing bigger miles again to Harpers Ferry, WV which is halfway. I’m planning on pushing north thru Harpers Ferry for a 2-3 days, then coming back in to get the Amtrak to come home for several days. It will be good to see everyone again and get caught up with everything.          It’s really going to be a mental game now with hiking next 500 miles as it’s a pretty boring hike from what I hear. After that there is approximately 500 miles in Maine and 100 miles thru the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Thinking about flip flopping and doing Maine and New Hampshire then filling in rest this fall when leaves are changing, maybe a week at a time. It should be easier access to the trail by Amtrak. My trail legs are important to maintain and am hoping by taking a week or 2 off n then back on for a week will give me greater endurance with resting muscles in between. We will see how it’ll work out.","

Two of the other hikers brought her pack in.

You get tears at just the weirdest things. I’m starting to think it’s about being so focused and trying to survive with all the wet weeather. I was walking down the trail and a hiker was just sitting there you could see he was having a hard time. So you just stop and talk try to encourage them. It’s weirdest thing I’ve ever experienced.

It does get old.  Next state is Maryland then into Pennsylvania. Next 500 miles is really flat till we get to Vermont. I’m excited to get to the White Mountains in New  Hampshire. To walk 1000 miles just seems really amazing, but it was the mode of travel in yrs past.

It seems like a long time.         Harpers Ferry is an interesting town with a lot of history. The town played an important part in the civil war as they used to make guns for the United States.

And the heat was unreal even at 5:30, 95 degrees and the heat index was 105. My legs were doing great but the rest of the body was yelling at me, don't do it. Took 3 hrs to do 5 miles and get up on top. It should be better tomorrow.         Talked to a couple of hikers about jumping ahead  to Rutland, Vermont and do the northern qtr to get out of the heat. I would probably come home after that and finish remainder during fall and early winter months, doing a week to 10 days at a time, as it would be nice to hike some of it with changing of the leaves, especially lower Vermont. It would be relatively easy to access the trail via Amtrak anywhere along the northeast corridor.           My strategy to beat the heat is to do 10-12 miles till lunchtime, take a break do 4-5 more then hole up somewhere for 2-3 hrs sleeping and eating till 5:30-6 and then go another 5-6 miles.

         I passed thru Gathland state park today and stopped to read some of the signs which told the story about some of the battles during the civil war in the area, very interesting. I would love to do a trip through the south to visit some of the battlefields. It's only been 150 yrs ago. It's really hard to imagine how they moved troops through the mountains with artillery and how they positioned troops as I walk along the ridges and valleys. 
         Hikers talk about a lot of things in the evenings. They talk about life and almost any subject you can imagine. An interesting subject came up the other evening during at the pizza place. They encourage no trace out on the trail. What you carry in you also carry out. Also going to the bathroom you have to dig a hole 6-8"" deep to do your business and then cover it up. One of the hikers said it's in the Bible and there was a scramble for the phones to look it up. Dueteronomy 23:13 so there's part of your reading devotions for you.","Stealth Site

I yelled and then got my headlamp and got out of tent to scan the woods, sure enough there was a pair of yellow eyes watching me 25-30 yards in the brush. So I scanned some more to see if there were more and then boom my headlamp died, now I'm really scrambling for new batteries and the flashlight on my phone, first I scan the wood line with it and nothing but I noticed the wind had shifted more to the left. Finally got batteries changed and checked the wood line brush and there they were directly down wind of me and now I get really nervous as he is definitely closer than the first time. So I yell and do hand waving and the eyes never left me. Now I have to make a decision. I'm trumping to remember what they said on AT orientation, green eyes are deer, blue are bear cubs, red is mature bears and yellow is more likely a cat of some kind. Geez, ok I now grab my trekking pole and put it within reach and it's now about 40-45 mins since I've heard the sneeze and I realize this thing is not going to leave but I'm gonna leave. It didn't take long to tear down and pack up and when I left those eyes were still there. I turned my back and walked down the trail not very excited to hike 4.5 miles in the dark considering the terrain and yes it's worse at night and one of the steepest downhills so far. I got into town to the AT pavilion in Port Clinton at 1:30 am. The hikers were amazed this morning to see me especially hiking in the dark with the terrain. It takes me an hr or 2 to slow my adrenaline down so I got an hr or 2 of sleep. So I did hike 23 plus miles yest unintentionally. So that's the story and prefer not having to many of those. Cyall!Ps: I mentioned this to Watchman this morning and he knew I was planning on tenting there and he thought about tenting as well but when he came through he said it just didn't feel right, so kept on going. Usually your intuition is right.","501 shelter

After just 2-3 hrs of sleeping in fits and starts and waking up after last nights rendevouz I called Cabelas in Hamburg as they provide a free shuttle from the AT pavilion to their store. From Cabelas I walked into Hamburg post office about a mile and half to pick up a package from home. Nobody picked me up when I tried thumbing a ride in and out but that was part of the greater picture as I see it now. I ate lunch at a cafe that the lady at the post office recommended, it was great. Then I walked almost a half a mile to do laundry and resupply at a store next door. Finally it's all done and I walk back to Cabelas to browse around and up to Walmart for a few items and by that time it's supper time, and right next door is a Chinese buffet yup I stuffed myself. Now back to Cabelas I go and am ready for a ride back to the pavilion and hike out later. The guy at the desk suggested I wait as there's another hiker who will need a ride. Ok then I'll sit outside and watch the people. There were a lot of Mennonites going in Cabelas this evening so I just relaxed. Finally decided to organize my pack with resupply, as I started a couple stopped to chat with me and asking questions. Then this Mennonite walked out with 5 children and said hi and I nodded, as they walked on I got this urge to talk to him and excused myself and walked outside and asked if they're from around here. They were, after a few minutes of chatting I asked if they would pick me up in the morning to go to church. It got better, I went home with them, had a real shower and set up my tent a ways from their house in a nice picnic area.  A pavilion, volley ball net and a stream running thru. Had a good chat before I went to sleep. I'm excited to go to church with them in the morning.       Looking back over the days events.... a lot of ifs.....if someone had picked me up on the way to postoffice....if someone would have picked me up on way back....if the lady wouldn't have suggested the restaurant......if the guy would had said the shuttle will be right there......if the bear encounter or whatever it was would not of happened......then this would not have been possible. Makes one wonder how much control we actually have over our life? Do we really? How many of you out there have had similar experiences if you would take time to think about chain reactions? Why? Bigger plans ahead? Does someone need to be touched in a special way? Do you yourself need to be touched in a special way? Think about it!","

When the lady came back with 2 of the hikers, she shuttled me to the trail head and I hiked 13 miles to the top of Baldy Mountain. Upper Goose Pond Shelter is another 5 miles and they serve pancakes there for the hikers. I decided to go to Baldy and see how I feel about hiking on in, I decided against doing that as I hiked the last hour in the dark, it would've been around 11-11:30 when I got there and not knowing what the trail is like nah not really interested. At least I got a light breeze and very little mosquitos here which is nice.        The other day at Great Barrington I talked to Pheriel who also does a journal on trail journals and he informed me he's going home, to many injuries. Another hiker got hurt pretty bad as he descended from Mount Everett. He slipped and fell and got cut up pretty bad and he said no more. After he fell another hiker came through and happened to be a paramedic so he checked him out and told him to go to hospital. He hiked to the road, not sure what happened after that. A lot of hikers are taking a zero in Great Barrington this weekend. Well I'm off to bed, erm, sleeping bag good night.","Sheffield Hiker House

I was hungry and thought I'd eat while doing the journal, I must say it's quite tasty even at this hour.        It rains almost every day now. Very miserable hiking. Vermont is probably worse hiking than Pennsylvania. You climb up the mountain then it's just a swamp up there and unbelievable mud. I stopped at a stream and took my shoes and socks off and washed them, which I then drip dried for 30 mins before putting back on. The southbounders all say it's another 70 miles of mud like that.

Thumper is from New Brunswick, just a great guy.          I'm dreading hiking again as a hiker said we haven't seen mud yet as some of the mud holes are deep. When you come to a mud hole you probe it with your trekking pole to see how deep it is, some of which I probed were approximately 16"" deep. I guess some are waist deep from what I've been told, so we will have to work our way around them. It's definitely going to slow my mileage down.

Their turkey on Irish soda bread topped with sliced apple and Vermont mild cheddar melted on it was simply delicious. The Appalachian Trail ran right into their parking lot in years past but they moved the trail about a mile down road.        There's a bus that runs back and forth from Rutland to the next town, makes it easy to get in for resupply.          The climb up to Mount Killington was a long one. The evening before I climbed 1 mile to the shelter and the next morning I left at 6 and started climbing. A total of 10.5 miles up, it took until 11:30 to get to the shelter at the base of the peak. They have a restaurant on the top for the ski resort and in order to get there you have to climb up and over the peak which was a 1000' very steep climb. I left my pack at the shelter and up I went, the last couple of 100' your grabbing onto rocks and trees above you to help pull yourself up. I love those rock scrambles like that.           My ankle was aching really bad last evening and is stiff this morning so I'll probably zero here to let it rest and with all the rain it's probably a good time to do it.

These Vermonters are really outdoorsy people, from hiking to skiing to just going for a pleasure hike to look for an amazing assortment of mushrooms or gems. The prep chef this morning was showing me the assorted amount of different gems he found the previous days. I guess you have to grow up in the area to know where to find them.           Ok ok, I know your brimming with curiosity about the 12 Tribes or so called the Yellow Deli. I stopped in for a sandwich while in town and chatted with the guys for a bit. One of the leaders of the group came out and chatted with me. The women were dressed very modestly with no makeup or jewelry. They wore blouses or shirts with skirts or some kind of flowing pantaloons with their hair in braids or put in buns. The men either wore pants or a type of long knee length shorts. I've been hearing about this group for awhile and finally one person said they are Christians. So I asked what they believed in and they believe in Jesus but they do practice communal living and if you join them you sign over all of your belongings and acts. They have a prayer, dancing and singing twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. They asked me to join for their evening worship service. They do seem very sincere. They are in 12 different regions of the United States, also in different parts of the world. They own farms where you work if you join. They are similar in structure as the hutterites but did say they're not as structured as they are. In a way it would have been interesting to join them for their evening worship, but decided against it as I'm hiking out in the morning and getting back and forth where I'm staying would of been an issue. It was rather an interesting afternoon. I can see where if someone came in from a family that had no love or a broken home it would be ideal as their worship service also is open to voice your opinion or are struggling with something to share what you're struggling with and talk about it. They have no leader per se except that 3 are over every thing. Definitely an interesting concept. I guess we do kind of same things when we step in to help someone, appoint 3 people to oversee the situation.          It's been a very interesting afternoon and now I'm signing off and get ready to hike in the morning less than 500 miles to go and I'm excited to get done, come home see the family again and the youth groups for singing, I've missed you all.","

The trail was a decent steep climb in the beginning then flattened out and that means just flatter it's still up and down in flat spots with 100' climbs up and down over boulders and flat rocks with those wooden steps in them as they are to steep to walk up or down. Some places I just throw my hiking poles up or down and climb up using trees and rocks to pull myself up. At lunchtime I started climbing up to the summit and it took forever it was very steep with part of the trail going up a stream. It was the longest steep climb I've done so far.

One of the hikers walked up and looked and tears just started flowing. It would be worthwhile just to hike 3 miles for the view.        They have a hut system thru the White Mountains where people pay to stay as they hike over the mountains. Very pricey but they have a crew at each hut that prepares food for them 3 times a day. They pack in the groceries for them. Hikers do have an opportunity to eat there too, but you have to wait till after the guests are done and then you ask for leftovers or if you arrive around 4 you can ask if you can do work for stay and eat. They have limited slots available at each hut. You work approximately 1-2 hrs doing dishes and etc. I would like  to do that at one of the huts just to have the experience.       I'm looking forward to a zero day as my left foot needs a break and of course I get to eat real food.

It was just a great day for a rest and I needed that for my legs and feet. My left ankle was pretty painful and the right knee was very miserable.        I'm still trying to figure out why I wanted to do this hike since I first read about about the Pacific Crest trail and the Appalachian Trail in the National Geographic. I can tell you this that the adventure part of it left a long time ago but it was still fun, now I do love challenges and dad always said I'm a klutz for punishment, lol, I took that as a compliment. Yep I'm homesick, I call or text my wife everyday that I have service. I try not to think about it to much as I do want to finish. I've never had so much continuous pain in my life. But you do kinda work through it. I've learned a few things, we live a life of luxury, a person can basically live with 30# of gear on his back and anything above and beyond is a blessing and a luxury. Makes you so much more thankful for what you have.        Things that I've lost and gained out here. First and foremost 47# weight wise, 4 toenails which I ripped one out accidentally at Thomas Knob Shelter in The Grayson Highlands when I tried stepping up on a rock and underestimated how stiff and sore I was, I slipped and fell backwards with my foot in a crack so as I went backwards my foot came out and my toenail, I sat there for an hour suffering in silence, so much pain and I was glad it was in mid40's and raining. It helped with the pain. I'm very humbled by all the people who supported me on this hike, from family to friends and all the trail angels who fed and cared for us. So now with a bit over 300 miles left and it being the toughest part, I have to reset my thinking on lower miles. I've gained a new respect for any thru hiker for all the extras in my life, I miss my family, friends, church and my youth groups for singing and can't wait to get done. Thru hiking is nothing to be proud of, it just teaches you what's important in life. I'm getting a bit philosophical here and I've had lotsa time to think out here, meeting new people  from all walks of life with different ideas and makes you reflect on what core values really are.

Duo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601453,"Friday August 24th journal: hiked 18 miles slept stealth camp Hello everyone,        Started the day with my breakfast of champions, oatmeal that's so amazing that I don't get tired of it. I keep switching back and forth with the following flavors Apple and cinnamon, brown sugar and maple. Bananas and cream, strawberries and cream, peaches and cream and blueberries and cream. Just a good wholesome breakfast quick and easy. Then my Bella vita cookies dunked in my instant Folgers. Now let's see what happened today.         As usual I have a habit of stopping and chatting with different people from day hikers, sobos and section hikers, I just get to meet people from everywhere. So I kept on hiking up and down over little peaks till I got to Zeacliffs where I sat down to eat dinner with cliffs towering up behind and the valley below, hoping no boulder comes crashing down. So I decided to check my map and mileage, whoa I can actually hike down to the road before it's totally dark and I took off because that would put me within a days hike of Lake of the Cloud hut where you can work for stay and eat. But you do have to show up at the right time. Anyway I got to the parking lot and found a stealth spot with a hiker already there from Wisconsin. He's been on the trail since February 2nd. I'm thinking like that's a long time, Wow! We chatted for awhile and then hit The bags. So that's it and I'm sure more exciting things will happen tomorrow. Let's see what happens!","Ethan Pond

       Wow, what a day from hiking up the mountain to sleeping and eating at the Lake of the Clouds Hut. First I started hiking and up I went and up from 1256' to 5030' in 11.5 miles, there were a few downs in between but what a climb. Amazing views above treeline. Over the past week I could see mount Washington in the distance every time I got on a peak with a view. Now I'm a mile down hill from the summit.        Now for the amazing story of the day. As I hike along I say hi and stop and chat with them and today I saw an elderly woman sitting on a stone looking out across the valley. I was close to the hut where I had planned to ask for work to stay and eat, but it was a bit early so I had planned getting close and stopping till about 5 before asking. Well there's somebody I can chat with and so we chatted as we walked towards the hut and she asks where I'm sleeping tonight and I replied at the hut for work. She said she has an extra bunk that she paid for and her husband said he's not gonna hike up there and it's mine if want it with dinner and breakfast included. Of course I'll take it. Just an amazing lot of people out here. Now I'm just one of the guests. For dinner tonight we had a thanksgiving dinner consisting of lentil soup with cornbread, salad, mashed potatoes, vegetables, turkey, buns, and chocolate cake. It was family style all you can eat. Yup hiker hunger kicked in and now I just want to fall asleep. There were approximately 90 hikers here just for the day or weekend with only 2 others and me as thru hikers. 4 hikers worked stay and probably 8 more showed up and paid to sleep on the dining room floor. Well that was the excitement for today.","Stealth Site

After the oatmeal we had scrambled eggs and sausage. All served family style.        Now it's time to climb to the summit of Mount Washington with the clouds disappearing as we started up, seems like a long mile up or maybe it's because you can see the top and it's steep. From 5030' to 6280'. I got a sandwich to carry out and down the other side and over to Madison Springs Hut for soup for lunch. Then up and over we went and down towards Pinkham Notch visitors center and stopped 2.5 miles out and they have a cafeteria there with hopes for breakfast in morning. It was a brutal down with rock hopping for over a mile, actually we did several miles of it today and by the time we got to camp I was absolutely wore out. Sparky hiked with me today, I had met him in the Shenandoahs he's about my age and from Pennsylvania.         Thanks again Cathy for the wonderful trail magic by providing me with a stay at the Hut and also the 2 girls I sat across from for breakfast who gave me some snacks, please do sign my guest book.

It was awesome! Then we showered grabbed a few resupplies and headed up wildcat mountain.      Wow what a climb that was. Started at 10 and finally reached the summit at 1. Took 3 hours to hike 3.6 to summit. Then it was another few miles to Carter Notch Hut which is the last one and I'm going to miss my soup stops for lunch. Carter notch is nestled in a notch by 2 lakes and cliffs high above the Hut. It's very isolated but does have trails that make it easier to access than via the AT.          The only funny thing that happened today was while I was eating dinner after setting up camp was the dive bombing of an owl. I was sitting getting my water ready and whoosh he just flies over my head and I duck. I look around quickly to see what it was and there he is watching me and there he comes again, geez now I'm ducking again and I don't want his talons grabbing my hair or digging in my face, now I'm really watching where he goes and I see him and this time he does a sideways swipe just past in front of my face and I see talons 12-16 inches from my face now I'm getting a bit nervous because they could hurt. He lands on a branch about 10' away, I'm watching and there he comes again now I'm up and getting my headlamp as I want to see what kind of owl it is, as soon as I turn the light on he takes off and that's the last I see of my owl divebomber. It was actually funny after it was over. Maybe I need a haircut. He probably thought it was a big hairy mouse or something. Well that's all for today, hope tomorrow brings some more.","Stealth Site

Rattle River Hostel is right along the trail and is a wonderful place to stay, they provide free breakfast and shuttle into Walmart for resupply.         First thing they do when you show up is tell you no shoes or trekking poles inside, then as you enter they have 2 rows of hooks for your backpacks and around the corner are 2 racks of loaner clothes to wear while they do your laundry. Also they have the 2 showers in that main entry room so you don't go stinking up the whole place. Stinky trashy hikers as some call us, it's not bad if you do maintain some cleanliness by using wipes after hiking. I just don't think some care or maybe they love smelling bad. I've been downwind of a few nasty ones and it's bad, real bad. I think maintaining a sense of cleanliness also helps with maintaining your morale.         We are approximately 16 miles from Maine I'm hoping we can hike into Maine to sleep there.

I had plans to make it up there but am glad I didn't as it started raining around 7 and I don't like carrying a wet tent ( trail pet peeve) my other pet peeve as of late is the clicking of my trekking poles on stone.       Tomorrow the plan is to hike to the start of the Mahoosuc Notch, which is the toughest mile on the AT. Usually takes hour and half to 2 hours. A couple of sobos are at the shelter and they said just a lot of rock climbing also rebar in the rock faces and ladders.

Duo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601900,"Howdy from Maine,       Finally in my last state, the great state of Maine. As we decided today Maine is insane. We did get a late start as it was raining this morning and quit around 9. So we started hiking and what a difference in 10 miles of terrain, up and down and climbing down hand over foot and back up again. It absolutely wore me out , with wooden ladders in some place and rebar in others or steps chiseled in stone. Everybody is just doing 10-11 miles a day. In the whites of New Hampsher you at least were going in one direction for a couple of hours, not so in Maine you will climb 50'-100' up stone walls and a quarter to half mile your climbing down again. It really slows you down considerably. We hiked to Full Goose Shelter (hmmm not sure why it's named like that) and are within a mile and a half of Mahoosuc Notch, hopefully I'll give a better description in tomorrow's journal.       Maine's mountain summits are just different and the weather was over cast with 35-40 mph winds on summits. You climb up on the summit and follow the trail on solid rock and all of sudden it drops off into a bog with wooden planks through the bogs. As I was walking along with the mists rolling by and  the wooden boards appearing out of the mist and disappearing into the bogs, it was a very wild feeling and reminded me of a story I read in my childhood, a book called The Hounds of Baskerville. Now the bogs on top can be very deceiving on depth as I learned the hard way, I have developed a habit of poking the board with my trekking poles to see if it disappears before stepping on it. The one I stepped on today was deeper than my shoes so I jumped off to the side which looked solid but wasn't in fact, now I was standing in the bog with both feet deeper than my shoes, and was yelling at the guy behind me take the boards, take the boards! We had a little laugh about it all. It wouldn't of been so bad but the temps were in upper 40'- low 50' with wind, not much sweating today, but does feel like fall coming. It is quite chilly tonite in my tent and reminds me of Georgia when I started.         There are approximately a dozen hikers at this shelter waiting to go through the notch tomorrow as some didn't want to do it today due to wet rocks. Also you don't want to start late in the day due to length of time it takes to climb through plus your muscles are already fatigued from the days hike. Well that's it, hope to pick up mileage again after this 40-50 insanely wild introduction to Maine. G'night","Gentian Shelter

Duo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601915,"Hi from wild Maine,         Maine is really a vast wilderness, as we experienced today again in the Mahoosuc Notch. It's a narrow valley with cliffs on each side and that's where all the boulders come from. Through these boulders you crawl through or over or jump across. I did go through 2 tunnels with the first one being to narrow for me and the pack, so I had to drag it behind me. There is a stream running through the bottom of it as you can hear it most of the time and only see it occasionally. I draped my trekking poles to my pack  and used mostly arms and shoulders and am getting quite sore tonight. You can usually find ice in the deepest crevices every month of the year and is cool as you go through by several degrees. I was almost done when a couple came from the other direction and we chatted a bit and ended up being Huckleberry and Buttercup or Butterfly who also have a journal.        I'm currently hiking with Vegas during the day or end up at the same camp every evening.

I see an occasional Moose track but no moose yet. Also haven't seen a porcupine either.       Ok now for the 'It Happened Again', as I was crossing a wide stream today by doing the rock hopping and one of the rocks had just a bit of water flowing over it and yeppers I lost my footing and ended up in the stream halfway to my knees.....now my feet are wet once again so I just waded the last 10'. I've had dry feet for sometime and it always makes me feel better if they are dry.

My intentions are if I wake up at 1-2 am as I normally do I'm going to start hiking.        Today's mileage was 19 and went over 5 summits, it's tiring but usually doesn't take long to hike up. Today as I came around the summit I saw Katahdin in the distance and became very emotional, to think that the journey is almost over, to have traveled this far and finally to be within 2-3 days of it being over. Ive got one little mountain left otherwise for the next 45 miles it's rather flat but am expecting the usual rocks and roots.       Actually I'm ready to come home see family and friends again. The longer I've been out here I've come to realize my wife is the hero in letting me do this, to let go and take care of things at home.","Stealth Site

Duo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603115,"Hello everybody,        Talk about tired that's what I was after my 28.5 mile hike. I started around 4 as I couldn't sleep. The trail was nice and flat with an occasional rock and root stretch till at least lunchtime. The last 11 miles were a little tougher as we had more of the former and a good climb thrown in at the end. When I saw the climb I was you got to be kidding and it was because I was tired, it was a 1000' climb and normally not a big deal but at the end of 28 miles it looked big. So to motivate me, I would take time to call my Son-in-law and wish Hadassah happy birthday when I got up to the top. Marion was getting ready to eat ice cream and cake, oh my word I got so hungry for cake and ice cream right there.         After lunch today I took a 30 minute nap and off I went again. I'm pushing to summit on Monday due to rain from hurricane moving in on Tuesday. I had planned on 30 miles but came to Crescent Pond and was just enough light to eat and off to bed I went, tired and sore. More tomorrow.","Crawford Pond Beach

Duo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603116,"Good evening,       I got out of the wilderness at 1:30 today. I'm excited to finish. I stopped at the restaurant on the trail and they said a big bubble went in and they allow only 20 hikers a day, so now I'm bummed out as what to do. Finally I decide to go to Millinocket which is 19 miles and get in touch with Commander. One of the people at the restaurant gave me a number of guy who shuttles people back and forth. Finally in town with phone service Commander texted me and they summited today, ok now I call the shuttle driver and he informs me he can get me in on a day pass in the morning without me going to get a reservation to climb. Seems so complicated. So now I leave at 5:30 in morning. Now only thing is to figure out how to get to Portland on Tuesday. We had a grand finale pizza party with some of the people I hiked with tonight, said our goodbyes and exchanged phone numbers. Well tomorrow is the big day 5 miles up and 5 miles down basically 8 hr round trip. Good night all.","Crescent Pond

Duo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603193,"A big howdy from Maine,      The journey of 2100 plus miles is over. I got picked up at 5:30 this morning and started my climb to the summit at 6:45. When I signed in at the trailhead register I saw Vegas and Voyager were ahead of me. I did catch up with Vegas after a mile and shortly after that we started in the rocks, now I wouldn't recommend doing this rock climb when it's wet as it would get pretty gnarly. Some of the rocks were slippery anyway but wet. WOW!! It would have been really challenging. In the toughest part we climbed for 30 minutes and had only done 2/10ths of a mile. The summit was enveloped in a fog which occasionally opened enough to where you could see a couple of hundred yards then it would close up again. There were about a dozen thru hikers summitting and lots of day hikers. I went up the Hunt Trail and descended on the Abol Trail which is less brutal which really was easier on my knee it was hurting pretty bad and I took my time coming down. It was  a 5 mile journey up and 4 miles down and takes approximately 8 hrs.        It's bittersweet in a way. I'll miss the friends I've made but not the trail food , Knorr sides, Idohoan potatoes and tuna packets. Also carrying my backpack and all the sweat and pain.      I've bought a bus ticket to Bangor, Maine for in the morning, from there I'll get another one to Portland where I'll meet up with my wife to travel down the coast on Amtrak for a couple of days on the way home. Find some fresh seafood to eat and now talking about food, everybody tells me I have to be really careful on my calories for the next month till my metabolism slows down or I'll gain weight really quick. I do hope to keep it in check.       Well that's it for now but will post a summary of my journey with some thoughts as I make a list of things that I find important about life in general as I've had a lot of time to think out here. It will take some time to organize my thoughts so keep checking back. It's been quite a journey!       A special thanks to my wife and my immediate family for their support without that it would not have been possible. Also my parents, brother and nephews and so many friends who called or texted me with encouraging words. A special thank you to my son-in-law Marion and Robert who hiked for several days in the beginning, also Ed (fence Ed) and son for joining me, hope Ed got over being sore :) that was a special treat to have you hike with me.","Crescent Pond
