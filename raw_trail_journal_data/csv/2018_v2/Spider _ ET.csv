Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593044,"Well, it is time to start our journal for our upcoming 5th section of the AT. The previous sections have been in ~500 mile chunks, but we are only planning to hike ~250 mile this time. The shorter distance is for two reasons: 1) We will spend most of our time on this hike in the White Mountains where miles do not come easy and 2) Spider had knee replacement last year (That's why we didn't section hike the AT last year) and not sure how the knee will handle the miles.
We have our plane tickets to fly to Boston, then a commuter flight to Lebanon, NH (town just south of Hanover, NH or starting point this year). With about 7 weeks to go, it's time to start organizing the food and gear. More on that later",,Home,"Jun 04, Mon",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593608,"Went shopping for our trail food today. We prefer to package up our food and send it to various P.O.s or Hostels along the way, rather than take ""potluck"" in the towns we pass through. We find we can balance our diet better that way and usually keep the amount of weight and space the food takes to a minimum. We will collect boxes from the Post Office on Monday and begin to fill them with food and other ""stuff"" over the next month.
We've been communicating with friends that we will connect with as we hike the northeast. We met one couple as we hiked through Virginia 3 years ago. They were thru-hiking the AT as we were hiking our 500-mile section. We hiked with them for about a week and had a great time. They own a place in Maine and invited us to stay with them when we hiked through their area...that will be this year!!
Also connected with a couple we met through our work in Chevron. Sherrie worked for Chevron for a while but later quit and moved to Virginia when her husband got a job with the Library of Congress. They met us and went to lunch when we hiked the AT through Virginia 3 years ago. Now they are retired in Cape Cod and have invited us to visit. So our plan is to see them at the end of our hike, before we head home.",,Home,"Jun 10, Sun",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595603,"Today we got all of our backpacking gear down from the attic and started going through it to make sure we have everything. We keep lots of stuff for camping, short distance backpacking, long distance backpacking etc., so it's not a trivial process to sort out everything we will need for the AT. But being overly organized, we have a list for everything, so started to go through our ""AT Gear List"".
To add to the chaos, we will be headed out on a week camping trip with friends in 2 weeks, so we are trying to set aside the gear for that too. It's a very different kind of camping with a 10-man tent, zero gravity chairs, queen-size air mattress etc....definitely prep for a ""Tale"" of two camping styles.
Both ET and I are creating a to-do list of what needs to get done before we head out on a 6 week trip. Both lists started out with only a couple of dozen items but seem to grow each day as we think of things, even though we are trying to complete things as fast as possible.
Only 30 days before we hit the trail!!",,Home,"Jun 28, Thu",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595970,"We visited ET's 89 year old mother to deliver her birthday present this weekend. She lives in Carmel, CA so took advantage of our time there to hike 5 miles around Pt. Lobos State Park. The trail is either rocky, rooty or gravely. It climbs up and down along the coastline. Great test for my new knee, my knee brace on my other knee and my cardio. Everything worked well...we averaged 2.5 mph.
Next we head to our second home, up on Lake Tahoe, for the 4th of July week. That should give us some time to hike at elevation and build up the red blood cells!!
We have made a first pass through all our gear and have made a trip to REI to fill in some gaps. Still have purchases of items from some other stores before we have everything but we are getting things organized",,Home,"Jul 01, Sun",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596214,"Happy Fourth of July!! We are spending it at our house at Lake Tahoe...only about the 4th time we have done that in the 15+ years we have owned it. We brought some projects for our AT hike up with us, plus the to-do list for this house, mowing the lawns, raking pine needles, trimming bushes etc. Will have my oldest son check on the place a couple of times while we are hiking the AT. Just one of the many things we have to arrange for being away 6 weeks.
Spider is the planner for all our hikes and he is pretty ""anal"" about it!! He has read many of the 2017 TrailJournals of those who hiked the area we will be hiking this year. From those journals, AWOLs book and the Thru-Hikers Companion he has planned our hike, noting particularly difficult sections, good hostels to stay at etc. He continues to tweak the hike, but realizes the trail, weather and our bodies will be final determiner of our hike. One recent tweak was to plan a slackpack of Mt. Moosilauke...southbound, based on recommendations of many who did it, or wished they had.
One of the projects we brought to Tahoe was reinforcing our hiking pants. From reading the journals, many had issues with wearing out their pants from sliding up and down on the many rocks that needed to be negotiated...The butt and crotch areas were particularly vulnerable. So Spider is using fabric glue to put patches of canvas on the butt of our hiking pants and on the knees. We don't know if it will work or not, but thought it might be worth a try. Also since Spiders ""new"" knee is painful to kneel on, he is adding some padding under his knee patches to make it more comfortable climbing on his hands and knees.
3 of our 5 food boxes are packed, we will finish the last 2 when we get back home. Wrapping up the last few loose ends about someone watching our house and picking up our mail.
We are 3 weeks away before we crawl on a plane to Boston...Getting excited!!",,Home,"Jul 04, Wed",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596901,"We are getting down to the wire with our preparation. Unfortunately daily life is continuing to pull us away from our preparation for the AT.  We both have to-do lists that range from 40-50 items. A lot of things to do when you plan to leave for 6 weeks!!
Attached is a photo of ET wearing her “augmented” hiking pants. We have put a layer of canvas on the seat and knees of our hiking pants in anticipation of doing a lot of climbing on hands and knees and sliding down on our butts in the Whites…and in Southern Maine. We wonder if these pants will be a best practice on the AT...or a folly…only time will tell.

We just spent a week at our house near Lake Tahoe. The plan was to acclimate to the 6000+ foot elevation and do some hiking. Unfortunately,  we spent most of you time doing things around our house getting it ready to be abandoned for 2 months and preparing things for our AT hike. So we got acclimatized but not much exercise (unless raking pine needles counts!!)

Spider spent a lot of time reviewing our hiking itinerary and ultimately made several changes that changed how much food we would carry each week and, in some cases, where the food resupply box would be sent. It’s important because the first resupply box goes out this week!! 
Spider completely packed his pack today (water, food etc.) and it weighed 38 lbs. A little more than previous years because of more cold weather clothing. He will be working over the next couple of weeks to try to get it down closer to 30lbs.

We have been watching the weather on Mt Washington with about a month to go before we get there. Looks like it will be a crap shoot…some days are magnificent and some are unhikable!!",,Home,"Jul 11, Wed",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597285,"We have a busy week next week so we are trying to finish up most of the detailed preparation for our AT hike this weekend. Spider finished all the documentation and reduced it on the copier to minimize the weight. We then finished packing all our resupply boxes and sent out the first box...makes our hike seem more ""real""! 
We have been going through all our gear to make sure it has survived it's storage for the last year, in usable shape. Our picture of today is our tent set up to ensure all parts were there and no surprise holes that might let the rain in...because we certainly expect rain!! We are watching the long-range forecast and it predicts we will arrive in Hanover, NH on a day of thunderstorms...which will turn to a day of showers by our third day on the trail. Oh Well...Welcome to summer in the Northeast!",,Home,"Jul 15, Sun",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598221,"4 more days and we will be hiking the AT. We just got home from a week in the mountains above San Diego. ET has an annual get-together with friends that she rode horses with when she was a young girl. Every year they have a reunion and those who still have horses, bring them. It is a week of socializing, eating and horseback riding in the Cuyamaca Mountains. However, since we don't have horses, we hiked. 
The elevation was similar to where we will be hiking in New Hampshire, 4-6000 feet so we decided to take advantage of it. We hiked all 6 days we were there and hiked about 50 miles, up every mountain around. The attached picture is from the top of the tallest mountain, Mt. Cuyamaca at 6512 feet. The temperatures were in the mid-80's so once again similar to what we are seeing in New Hampshire...the difference was we only carried daypacks and the humidity was only 30-40 percent. However, our bodies stood up to the onslaught of day after day hiking and Spider had a good test of his new knee.
After getting home yesterday, we have been racing around completing all the tasks we waited until the last minute to tackle like paying bills ahead through August, haircuts, last minute clothes washing etc. We each have about a dozen tasks still to do, but by tomorrow afternoon, if they aren't done, they won't get done!!
We are getting excited about finally getting back to the AT!!",,View Entry,"Jul 24, Tue",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598386,"We finished all of our to-dos today and actually had some time to relax. Our neighbor Carl volunteered to take us down to the BART station, eliminating the need to call a taxi or schlep our backpacks on the local bus...Thanks Carl!
We arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before our red-eye was scheduled to depart. However when we tried to check in our bags/packs, we found our flight had been CANCELLED within the last hour. After spending 45 minutes with a United ticket agent it became obvious that we were not getting to Boston tomorrow morning as planned...which means we would also miss our connecting flight to Lebanon/Hanover, NH. Hmmm..we know we have to be flexible on our itinerary on the trail due to weather and terrain challenges, but didn't expect to have the need for flexibility to start at the airport!
We are scheduled now to fly out tomorrow morning and now have a reservation on a bus to get us to Hanover (we arrive too late to reschedule our connecting flight). If all goes as planned we will arrive in Hanover about 14 hours later than originally planned. Which means we may need to modify our hiking plan..that is yet to be determined.
So where I expected to have a picture of ET lounging in the airport waiting for our plane to take off..instead we have ET lounging in the hotel room we were comped by United. Hopefully things will work out better tomorrow!",,View Entry,"Jul 25, Wed",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598482,"Last night we ate dinner in the hotel's dining room..mostly on United's dime... and got to bed at 10pm. During this time, Spider was busily canceling our connecting flight from Boston to Lebanon/Hanover. The Cape Air lines flight was something we had been looking forward to... unfortunately they had no flights scheduled we could connect with on our altered itinerary... Darn! Based on his earlier research he knew of a bus line that ran from Boston to Hanover... and the ran into the night. So he made a reservation for this evening. Lastly, Spider called the motel in Hanover to let them know we were changing from an early arrival to a late arrival!
Up at 6am to catch the 6:30am shuttle. To the airport by 7am for our 9:30 flight... wanted to make sure we had plenty of time to deal with any ""surprises"" that might come up... of course there were none! Sooo, we had plenty of time for breakfast at the airport.
Uneventful flight and landed in Boston a little early... in the rain... Uh oh! Got to the bus stop at the terminal and caught our Dartmouth Coach bus. Arrived in Hanover at 10:15. Pulled up the Uber app and... nothing... Uh oh! Walked to the nearby Hanover Inn and asked for taxi recommendations... got 3. After several no answers finally got the Big Yellow Taxi to pick us up. Arrived at our motel at 11pm. 
Arriving this late means all the town ""stuff"" we planned on doing today by arriving early, will have to be done tomorrow morning...stuff like buying fuel for our stove. This means a later start on the trail than planned, so it is yet to be determined if we will make the miles we planned for Day 1.
Time for bed!",,View Entry,"Jul 26, Thu",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598692,"We awoke to our alarm at 7am...lots of things to do! We first repacked our backpacks to be packs for the trail and not suitcases for the airplane by taking out our trekking poles, moving food and raingear to be accessible,  etc. We took showers, our last for awhile, then went to the lobby for our free continental breakfast at 8am. Unfortunately you get what you pay for: watered down orange juice, watered down coffee, watered down waffle mix and stale Cheerios. But we found enough to fill us up. The best part of the breakfast was the other guest there having breakfast. It was a guy who had just finished hiking the section of the AT that we were about to hike. So we picked his brain!  Really special, the guy just finished section-hiking the AT, over 25 years.
Spider had voluntered to go get the fuel for our stove (airlines prohibit the transportation of stove fuel so we always have to find a source at our destination). His plan was to use the local free bus system to a nearby hiker supply store. So while ET continued her conversation with the other hiker, Spider headed to the bus stop. Given he would have to change buses both directions, the speed at which he was able to do this would determine what time we could get on the trail. Fortunately, all connections worked well and Spider returned by 9:30am. We got dressed for the trail, finished packing our packs, checked out of the motel and caught the 10:30am bus to downtown Hanover.
We officially stepped back on the AT at 10:40am. Hooray! It started with a walk through the streets of downtown Hanover. Once at the edge of town, the trail entered the woods and we began to climb, steeply in some places. Our packs were full of 6 days of food and our bodies were city-soft, so the miles came very slowly. We maintained our usual pattern of hiking for an hour, then taking a 20 minute break to rest and eat a little food. We calculated that we were moving at about 1.5 mph. That made it a long day. As we hiked, we were passed by all the twenty-somethings who are thru-hiking the AT. We also met Otto, an older man hiking the AT from New Jersey to Maine. He too passed us by!
Things were going well until about 3pm when the predicted thunderstorms hit. We started hearing thunder at around noon, but it was far away so we hoped it would pass us by. No such luck. We stopped to put the rain covers on our packs but decided to not put on our raingear. We were already soaked from sweat with the 80 degree weather, and putting on raingear only makes us hotter. So on we hiked in the light rain..then heavier rain...then buckets of rain! The rain lasted for about 2 hours. The trail had been wet from rain on previous days, but now it was a river! We waked cautiously because of wet, slippery roots and rocks, and then we had to walk on the edges of the trail to avoid the deep water.
We finally made it to Mink Brook at 5:30pm, about 2 miles from our destination shelter. Unfortunately, all reports Spider had read was that the water source at the shelter had dried up, so we needed to get our water at Mink Brook. We filtered a 2 gallons of water then headed out..uphill! It was a slow trudge up South Moose Mtn to the shelter (no we didn't see any moose!)...arriving at 8pm just as it was getting dark. 
We quickly set up our tent and ate our dinner by using our headlamps. Ironically, we found out that the water source at the shelter was once again flowing due to the recent rains..oh well! To bed by 9pm...we are finally back on schedule.","Hanover, NH

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598695,"We had a little excitement during the night. At about 3:30am we were awaked by a clap of thunder. As we lay there, a parade of lightning and thunder continued. Soon it began to rain..very hard at times. Kind of hard to sleep when you feel like you are inside a drum! The storm lasted about 2 hours. After that we fell back to sleep until about 7:30am.The sun was shining with a few clouds when we crawled out of the tent. We decide to have breakfast in camp rather than on the trail like we usually prefer. We finally hit the trail at 9:40am..much later than usual for us.
The first thing we did was crawl up North Moose Mountain (still haven't seen a moose.) Then we had a long run down the north side of North Moose Mountain.  Along the way we took a break at a rare viewpoint, which is today's picture. In the distance is Smarts Mountain, a mountain we will climb tomorrow. We continued down about 1300 ft only to climb back 1000 feet to Holt's Ledges. These ledges are a Peregrine Falcon nesting area and we could hear them screeching as we looked at the vista.
Next was a steep descent to a road, then the last several miles were a series of small ups and downs. At one place, after crossing a small creek, we had to climb an 8 ft vertical rock wall. This is where we had to let the treking poles dangle from there straps and use our fingers and toes to grip the rocks and roots and climb the wall. We understand we will have many more opportunities to do this, for a further distance, in the upcoming days...Oh Boy!
We made it to the area we were going to stealth camp by 6:40pm. We found a big, soft, leaf-covered area where someone else had obviously camped. It was nice to be able to set up our tent and eat dinner before it got dark. We are now positioned to tackle the tough climb up Smarts Mountain tomorrow.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598777,"No rain last night so a full 24 hours with no rain,.  Wahoo! We knew we had a long day with a big climb, so we set the alarm for 6am. We hit the trail at 7:10am. Within 0.1 miles we began our climb of Smarts Mountain. Its advertised as the first test of climbing that will be repeated multiple times in the White Mountain Range. It started  with a steep 1200 ft climb to Lambert's Ledges. These were solid slabs of granite with some distant view. We sat on one of these slabs and had our breakfast.  Next the trail undulated for a mile as it worked its way on a side ridge of Smarts Mountain. Then we started a climb almost straight up over granite for a 900 ft ascent. Todays picture is what some of the trail was like, all in one - log steps, stone steps, rebar steps, stone steps again, and mixed rock and roots.  We finally reached the top after 5 hrs of climbing...to go 3.8 miles. It was a long climb and half the day long.
At the top of Smarts Mountain was a fire tower. Like so many we have seen on our AT hikes, this one was abandoned since fire detection is now done by satellite.  The good thing was we were able to get cell signal from the tower so sent off yesterday's journal. After a quick break, we headed down the backside of Smarts Mountain.  Unlike the frontside this was a reasonably gentle descent of 3.9 miles. We expected to make good speed on this descent. What we didn't count on was the MUD! Every 20 yards was a 10 ft stretch of black, gooey mud anywhere from 4 inches deep to a foot deep. We slowed to skirt these muddy areas, which slowed our overall speed..Oh Well!
We crossed a brook a the end of our descent then started our second climb of the day to Eastman Ledges, a 450ft climb but pretty steep. Another descent followed to another brook...and finally a 200ft climb to our shelter at 6:15pm. Over 11 hrs of hiking. Whew!
This shelter is fairly unique in that it is hexagonal.  It also only has 2 tentsites so wondered if we would have a spot. BUT when we arrived only 3 hikers were there, all using the shelter. So we had our choice and picked the higher, more private one and then colled iles of leaves to cover the rooty surface. We set up our tent, then went to the shelter to eat dinner. While there a southbound hiker came in and set up in the other tentsite. She had a very unique setup. It was a hammock that looked like a tent with poles and a rainfly. She said that when there were no trees, she could set on the ground like a tent. Multipurpose! We went to bed at 8:15pm.","Stealth camp near Grant Brook
",Hexacuba Shelter,"Jul 29, Sun",9.20
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598900,"Today is our 3rd day without rain. It's been great. Still humid at the lower elevations, but nicely cooler higher up.
Once again we set the alarm for 6am. We hit the trail at 7:15am. The first order of business was to climb 900 ft of the sourh peak of Mt. Cube. When is a cube rocky? When it's a mountain in New Hampshire... and boy was this mountain rocky. We started our climb by working our way up a rockfall with most rocks the size of an easy chair. Then we transitioned to going up granite slabs, like the one shown in today's picture. 
After reaching the summit we had a long descent of 3.3 miles to highway NH 25A. During our descent we met several people who were doing a day-hike to Mt. Cube's summit. All the young folks just said ""Hi"" and kept hiking. But all the old folks had to stop and ask Spider about the brace he wears on his left knee. Then the conversation quickly turns to knee replacements when they learn that Spider's right knee had been replaced. Guess there are a lot of people out there our age who are considering knee replacements.
After crossing the highway, we started our climb to Ore Hill. The climb was moderately steep, but no rockfalls or granite slabs. However there were plenty of mud patches to skirt that slowed us down. One section was an endless string of big stepping stones alternating with split logs and boards which we sailed across. 
We made it to our campsite by 4pm. It was a large tent camping area with a great spring with clear, cold water and a very clean privy.  Not surprising since the shelter burned down 8 years ago. Few hikers carry a tent.  They stay in the shelters, so bypassed this site. 
We finally arrived at camp early enough to leisurely set up our tent and have time to relax before dinner.  We tented by the trail to the spring, thus meeting the 3 people around for the night. We were to bed by 8pm.","Hexacuba Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598959,"No rain again, but the hikers are talking about rain tomorrow. That's the day we had planned to hike the first mountain in the White Mountains range. Hmmm
We set the alarm for 6am. Hopefully we will soon be on East Coast time and won't need an alarm. We hit the trail at 7:20am. We're getting slower, not faster in breaking camp. We'll have to work on that.
The first part of the day was several ups and downs to the top Ore Mountain. Fortunately we were able to get cell service there and could send off yesterday's journal. Cell reception is getting pretty sketchy.
After that we descended to NH 25A. Then our big climb of the day, 650 ft to the top of Mt. Mist. We both felt much stronger today. Some of that is due to a slightly easier trail; some of it is 4 days on the trail to rid ourselves of the city ""softness"" and some of it is the lighter packs (we've eaten most of our food). Or maybe its because we knew there was a hostel to stay in at the end of the day that has a bed and SHOWERS (just the way horses speed up when you point them back to the barn!). Whatever the reason, we moved faster today. 
Once at the top of Mt Mist we had a descent to NH 25. We passed 8 south-bound hikers today. We have been seeing south-bounders ever since we started hiking, but today was the most. Most of them started in Maine in May or June.
We made it to highway NH 25 at 1:40pm. Wahoo!! We hiked the quarter mile to the Hikers Welcome Hostel and checked in. They had our resupply box that we had mailed from home. Next we took showers in an outside shower. It was plenty warm enough. I can't describe how good a shower feels after hiking for 5 days. Today's picture is of ET in front of our hostel, all cleaned up!
After showers, was laundry, so now we look and smell reasonably clean. Given our presentable appearance, we were allowed on the shuttle to town for food. It's nice not to worry about what we eat. After sub sandwiches, potato salad and potato chips, with a bottle of wine, we topped it off with Ben & Jerry's ice cream.
Tomorrow, we enter the White Mountains by hiking over Mt. Moosiauke. It is over 4800 ft. and part of it is above treeline. (Treelinee is around 4000 ft here in contrast to the Sierras, at about 10,000 ft.) Thunder showers are forecast for the next 2 days, then 2 days of rain, so we're carefully weighing our options regarding hiking and taking planned zero days (days where we hike zero miles of the AT). 
To bed by 9pm.

",Kinsman Notch/ Hikers Welcome Hostel,"Jul 31, Tue",7.50
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599361,"We awoke around 6:30am as other hikers began to stir. (That's a problem when we sleep in a bunkhouse.) This time however, it was an advantage. When we went to bed, the 7:30am shuttle to Kinsman Notch was full, so we had signed up for the 8:30am shuttle. But when we looked at the sign-up board this morning, several people had erased their name from the 7:30am shuttle. We grabbed the spots. Wahoo!
We planned to slackpack Mt Moosilauke. (Slackpacking is where we only carry what we need for a dayhike..lunch, water, raingear etc., no tent, sleeping bags, stove, etc.) Today we hiked SOUTH on the AT instead of NORTH. The shuttle dropped us off at what would have been our next destination, Kinsman Notch. We hiked back to the hiker hostel. The section of the AT coming off Mt. Moosilauke to Kinsman Notch is very steep as in a 2200 ft drop in 1.9 miles. It utilizes several near-vertical rockfalls that have been augmented with rebar and wooden steps. Descending this vertical ""staircase"" is very hard on the knees...going up it, not so much. Furthermore, going down this vertical ""staircase"" is significantly more dangerous in the rain because all footholds become slippery..and is forecast for today! By slackpacking a southbound route, we would instead be ascending the vertical staircase... and without heavy packs.
We arrived at Kinsman Notch and hit the trail at 8:10am under partly cloudy skies. After crossing a few streams, the climb began in earnest...and boy what a climb! Following the trail up the vertical rockfalls was a challenge, sometimes requiring a grab of a nearby tree or rock to pull youself up a high steep. Traversing the near-vertical granite slabs was by blocks of wood held into the rock by metal pins.  All the while, a cascading series of waterfalls roared not more than 10ft away.
We had about 3000 ft. to climb to reach the summit, which we did at 12:30pm..3.8 miles in about 4.5 hours! Hmmm...welcome to the ""Whites""!
Unfortunately, the partly cloudy day had turned into a cloudy day and we were in the clouds at the summit. Today's picture is from the summit with ET next to the sign...but that's it. No magnificent views of the rest of the White Mountain, only white fog/clouds. 
As we left the summit, the mist was so thick, we could barely see the trail. We followed the cairns, or ducks (5 ft. piles of rocks). The wind was blowing the fog across the mountain at 20-30 mph and the temperature had dropped to the low 50s. What a difference elevation makes...and me in a sweat-soaked shirt..Brrr! No wonder the guidebooks tell you to pack your cold weather gear before entering the Whte Mountains.
The trail remained a gentle descent for about a mile before it headed steeply down the mountain...not as steeply as the trail on the otherside, but still steep and still down a rockfall. We had a 3800 ft. descent ahead of us.  Fortunately,  after 2.7 miles and a 2300 ft drop, the steepness eased a little and the trail became less rocks and more soil.
The skies continued to darken and we had felt a few raindrops around 3pm. But at 4pm it decided to really rain..big fat drops. By this time we were hustling along a fairly flat part of the trail knowing the end was near. The last gauntlet was a stream crossing about 20 ft across, with no bridge and no big rocks to hop across on. So we worked our way across using the larger rocks that were submerged about an inch below the surface...thank goodness for waterproof boots. Not sure what crossings will be like tomorrow after the rain!
Next was NH 25 and our quarter mile trudge in the rain back to the hostel. In the forest the trees catch a lot of the rain..not so next to the highway. We probably got wetter in the 5 minute road walk than in the previous 40 minutes of forest walk! We finally arrived back at the hostel at 4:45pm..a long but rewarding day.
As we arrived, other hikers were phoning in their dinner orders to a local burger joint, so we jumped on that! We showered and caught the 2nd shuttle for a delicious meal. Back at the hostel we headed to our bunks for a good night's sleep, happy to have completed the first of the White's.Milestone: We passed the 50 mile mark today on this year's hike","NH 25 / Hikers Welcome Hostel

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599362,"We both woke up about 6:30am and snuck downstairs (because others were still asleep) and got our morning coffee. It had rained most of the night and was still dripping when we got up. Today is a ""Zero Day"" for us meaning we have no plans to hike any miles of the AT. We try to work in a day of rest each week so the muscles and joints get a day off, equipment gets repaired and we connect with family and friends.
The last of the people we have met at the hostel over the last couple of days left this morning and a new set has started coming in. All of a sudden we are the experts in explaining how things work around here when the caretakers are not available.
As mentioned earlier, this hostel format is as a bunkhouse. There is a second floor bunk area in the main building and a separate building called the ""Barn"" that has a first and second floor of bunks. There is a common area in the main building with a refrigerator containing food and drinks for purchase, a TV with a huge DVD collection and a computer to access the internet. There are also outside picnic tables under a cover to sit at. Lastly there is an outdoor shower, sink, washer, dryer and toilet all under a cover...and that is today's picture. Everything is on the honor system. If you get a soda from the fridge, you mark it on your individual sign-up sheet. When you head back to the trail, you use the data on your sign-up sheet to establish your bill. The system seems to work!
One of the services the hostel offers is to mail USPS boxes for hikers. Some mail food and equipment ahead to their next stop, while others mail stuff home. We are doing the latter. We have established that we each brought things we haven't used and are likely not to use or have duplicated something that only one of us needs to carry. So a box of ""stuff"" is going home, satisfying our quest to get our packs ever lighter.
Our Zero Day is also a time to assess how are bodies are doing so far. Everyone is asking about Spider's ""new"" artificial knee and his other ""good"" knee with the mega-brace. The answer is ""Great...so far"". He got periodic pain in the ""good"" knee when he stepped wrong, but has learned to avoid that now for the most part. His ""new"" knee has not given him any pain. The biggest issue for both knees is range of motion. Big steps up or down are more limited with the brace and with the artificial knee. So Spider is always looking for routes down the trail with steps no more than 1 ft high. Sometimes that means zig-zagging down the trail.So far Spider's toe sleeves have prevented any blisters from forming.
ET is doing great. She has had one knee complain especially after long downhills.  But she's always good-to-go the next day. Her left hamstring is bothering her today after yesterday's workout.  But it's nothing Ibuprofen won't fix. She also has had no foot blisters. So we can say we are in pretty good shape to head out on week 2 of our AT adventure.
We have been watching the weather and it looks like another storm is coming in tonight and will last for a couple of days. That's unfortunate timing since today will be a mostly dry day and would have been a good hiking day. That is why we carry raingear!
The hostel has no cell service, but does have WiFi. So we used ET's iPhone to FaceTime with Carol and BJ, JT and family, and Zak and family. 
We had burgers again at the Roadside Grill and made it to bed by 10:00pm.","Kinsman Notch/ Hikers Welcome Hostel

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599363,"We woke at 6am and went downstairs for breakfast. Then back upstairs to pack up. We paid our bill then caught the 7:30am shuttle Kinsman Notch to continue our hike north
Hit the trail at 8:10 with an immediate climb of 800ft in 0.7 miles. After that it was a series of ups and downs but ever increasing in elevation. 
The character of the trail has changed - many more rocks and roots. Where the trail finally flattens out, it forms bogs of deep mud that need to be negotiated. Even when the profile shows the terrain as flat, there are 8-10 ft walls of granite to climb or slide down...thus our mph continues to drop.
We finally made it to our high-point of the day, Wolf Mountain and headed down toward our destination shelter. The skies had been overcast all day, but the predicted rain held off until 3pm. It started off as light rain but steadily increased in intensity. The picture of the day is ET relaxing at our last break, totaly soaked, in the rain next to her covered pack.
We finally arrived at the shelter at 4:45pm. With heavy rains predicted we opted to stay in the shelter. There were eventually 5 of us sheltering overnight. As expected. The rains intensified to a heavy downpour. We were glad to be inside and dry!

",Eliza Brook Shelter,"Aug 03, Fri",7.50
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599424,"We woke at 6:30am to rain. It had rained all night, very heavy at times. Based on the weather report we had seen before leaving the hostel yesterday, the rain was supposed to taper off mid to late morning. So we thought we would wait to see if the forecast was right. Hiking in the rain is no fun. Several others in the shelter braved the rain.
At about 10am the rain began to subside, but not before several rounds of torrential downpours. We packed up and were ready to go when one of the other hikers from the shelter came from getting water at the nearby ""brook"" and said it was a raging river. Uh oh. We had to cross the brook to continue on the AT. We went down to look at the brook and there is no way we could safely cross it. We were trapped! The picture of the day is of the brook we needed to cross - thigh deep and running fast with eddies.
It turned out 2 other couples were in the same boat. We all evaluated the crossing and determined it would not be safe to do so. Our only option was to wait it out until the level of the brook dropped to a safe crossing level...but how long would that be? Hours or days? The problem was that the other 2 couples had just finished the last if their food! However as luck would have it, there were 2 guys at the shelter that were calling quits. They had hiked the same trail we had the previous day and decided it was just too tough. So since they ha 6 days of food, they gave the needy hikers their food.
Sitting around waiting was boring, so Spider hunted for an alternate crossing while ET got to know the other hikers. An hour after the rains stopped we didn't see much change in the river. However 2 hours after, we could see the water level had dropped a little.  Spider actually stuck a stick vertically in the sandy bottom of an eddy to measure the drop. 
Just after 1pm the level had dropped almost a foot and 2 southbound hikers braved the crossing and made it. That was all we needed. We hit the trail at 1:30pm (That is to say we all crossed the brook with Spider leading the way.) We made sure all 6 people were across, plus the dog Nellie.
We decided to modify our hiking plan to make it to a shelter 4 miles away instead of a steath camp 5.9 miles away. Unfortunately that made tomorrow's hike a little longer.
The trail followed the brook upstream and there were plenty of indications the the trail had been flooded earlier. Then the trail really began to climb. We were back to the vertical granite slabs that required us to grab trees to pull us up or using our hands in the cracks in the granite. The only break in the climb was when we reached Harrington Pond after 1.4 miles. The trail worked its way around the pond, but the plank walkway through the boggy fringe was under 2-3 inches of water. If we thought we were keeping our feet dry on this day, this took care of that!
Over 4 hours, 2.5 miles and 1900 ft climb later we reached the top of South Kinsman Mtn., one of the toughest climbs we've done so far. Then down to a saddle and back up to North Kinsman Mtn., with some more tough climbing. Finally we headed down. Unfortunately the down was designed like the up and it was tougher finding our way down vertical slabs then going up. ET made good use of the ""augmented "" seat of her hiking pants!
We finally made it to Kinsman Pond Shelter at 7:30pm. Another late arrival. The Whites have an policy from Kinsman Pond on, of charging for shelters/campsites. So we checked in with the caretaker and found that all the campsites were full. So on to the shelter we went. Turns out we were the only section/thru hikers there. Everyone else was there for the weekend to hike. A late dinner and to bed by 9pm.","Eliza Brook Shelter
",Kinsman Pond Shelter,"Aug 04, Sat",4
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599944,"We awoke at 6:45am... can't set an alarm in a shelter with 12 other people! As mentioned, none were thru/section hikers, so the desire to get up and out is not there.  So at 6:45am only 2 other people were awake. The other problem is the noise we make packing up. So our technique is to pull everything quietly outside the shelter and pack up outside. We finally hit the trail at 7:45am. We had a longer day than originally planned because of our short day yesterday. 
For the first mile it was more of the vertical granite faces, only many of them had the wooden blocks affixed to them or re-bar steps like we saw on the climb of Mt. Moosilauke. The hikers get treated better on this side of the mountain!  After the quick descent, the trail eased a little, but still plenty of rock descents. Our first mishap: Spider slipped and fell on a rock. Unfortunately his trekking pole was between him and the rock and it broke. Fortunately he was able to telescope it back into itself past the break and it was again a functioning trekking pole, albeit shorter. And guess who hikes with a shorter trekking pole? ET! So we have swapped trekking poles.
In 1.9 miles we reach our first Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) hut. These are accommodations in the forest similar to the High Sierra Camps in the Sierras, except these are permanent buildings. The AMC also run the campsites like the one we just left. When we paid our fee at Kinsman Pond Shelter, we were given orange cards to signify we were thru-hikers or long section hikers. That card gets us a discount at future AMC campsites and free ""goodies"" at AMC huts. So we stopped at the Lonesome Lake Hut.
Each hut it staffed by a ""Croo"" that prepares the meals for people staying in the bunkhouses and provides housekeeping, maintenance and the evening's entertainment...all this for about $100 a night/person. When we went in, the cook pointed us to free pastries and the water faucet...ahhh uniodized water! Inside the hut is our picture of the day.
When we finally made it back the trail it was significantly easier and flatter. Had to be a little easier for all the folks that have to hike to the hut. In 1.5 miles we came to Cascade Brook. It was still running high from the previous day's rains. The caretaker at Kinsman Ponder Shelter said it had been impassible yesterday, like Eliza Brook. Fortunately for people heading to the hut, a side trail followed the brook down to a parking lot. Unfortunately for us, we needed to cross Cascade Brook. We found some good rocks to cross on, but they required some big jumps. ET gave up on one and just waded across.
1.1 miles later we had lunch next to a stream under the I-93 freeway underpass. Then we began our climb of the day, 2000 ft up in 2 miles. The last 1000ft was up a steep rockfall. We finally arrived at 6pm to find the campsite full. There were lots of groups of teens who were getting their outdoor ""experience"". All that was left were some marginal sites. We took one. Dinner and to bed by 8:30pm.","Kinsman Pond Shelter
",Liberty Springs Campsite,"Aug 05, Sun",7.40
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599945,"We awoke at 6:15am. Our marginal tentsite was... marginal. We both awakened several times during the night to find we had slid into one corner of the tent or another. We hit the trail at 7:45am.
We immediately continued up the rockfall we had been walking up yesterday. We eventually reached the ridge 0.3 miles later. We then followed the ridge for about 1.5 miles to Little Haystack Mtn. It was a fairly difficult climb but only about 500 ft. up. Near the top we broke out of treeline and could see in all directions. Staying above treeline, we hiked up about 300 feet to the top of Mt. Lincoln. The Whites are also known as the Presidential Range because the mountains are named after presidents.
We were hiking Franconia Ridge. On a clear day, many of the locals hike the ridge because of its views...and most of them were out today. The trail was packed! After Mt. Lincoln came Mt. Lafayette....not sure how he got a mountain named for him in the Presidential Range, but there it is. We had spectacular views from everywhere along the ridge, as you can see from today's photo.
Finally we dropped off the ridge and back into the trees. It was a steep descent and we had to take it slowly.  We both ran out of water in our hydration systems, so had to find a spring to filter some water to keep us going. 
The last challenge was to climb Mt. Garfield - 600 ft up in less than a half mile. It was a tough climb at the end of the day! After reaching the summit, we descended to our shelter, arriving at 6:45pm. It took us 11 hours to go 7.7 miles. I think we are getting slower not faster! Dinner and to bed by 8:45pm.","Liberty Springs Campsite
",Garfield Ridge Shelter,"Aug 06, Mon",7.70
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599946,"One thing about sleeping in a campsite with others tenting nearby, when the first person gets up, everyone else is awake. In today's case the first person got up at 5:45am. There was a threat of thundershowers later today and the AT follows the ridgeline for about 6 miles. Lightning and hikers on ridgelines is not a good combination, so some hikers were heading out early. We were okay with an earlier start since we are trying to hike 9.5 miles today to position us to get off the trail tomorrow for a couple zero days..Hooray!  We packed and hit the trail at 6:45am.
We were warned by another hiker that the first 0.3 miles from the shelter were one of the steepest descents on the AT, and boy was it. Almost a vertical drop! After that the trail began a series of steep, short ups and downs. Finally we started to climb to Galehead Hut, another of the AMC huts. We spotted it yesterday from a viewpoint, sitting on a ridge majestically overlooking the valley.
We finally made it to the hut by 10:30am, and once again partook of the left over pastries, and ET got her morning coffee. It was a congregating place for all the hikers that had been at the shelter we had been at last night. We also watered up for the rest of the day's hike. It was tough leaving, but we finally pried ourselves away to start our major climb of the day up South Twin Peak...1200 ft in 0.8 miles!
We finally made it to the top of South Twin Peak at 12:30pm. We had great views of the surrounding countryside..and of the building thunderclouds. The picture of the day is looking back at the ridge we hiked yesterday. We could see Little Haystack Mtn to the left, Franconia Ridge, Mt. Lincoln and Mt. Lafayette in the center and Mt. Garfield to the right. It's amazing to the we were there just yesterday!
Next we began our descent off South Twin Peak along the ridge - the start of the 6 miles of ridgeline hiking. At about 2 pm we heard our first rumble of thunder. We had decided if it looked like it was really going to rain, we would find a stealth site and quickly set up the tent, instead of getting drenched like we did on our first day of hiking. It began to rain at 4:40pm.we immediately starting looking for a steath site. We had been seeing them all day, but do you think we could find one? Nope! We hiked in the light rain until 5:30pm when we finally found a spot to set up the tent, 1.5 miles short of our planned camping spot. That makes a longer day for tomorrow, and thundershowers are forecast for tomorrow afternoon too!
We quickly set up our tent and got inside, expecting the deluge we had experienced on our first day of hiking. But today the rain stopped soon after we crawled into the tent...as of 8pm, no more thunder and no more rain. We'll see how the night goes.","Garfield Ridge Shelter

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599947,"We set the alarm for 6am. We had many miles to travel and, depending on the trail conditions, it could take us many hours. No rain last night, so our rush to set up the tent before the deluge was just Mother Nature messing with us. Oh Well! We hit the trail at 7:10am.
The trail continued to follow the ridge for 0.5 miles before starting downhill. The ridge trail was reasonably flat so we made good time but the trail down was rocky and slow. Wild blueberries slowed us as well.  We made it to Zealand Falls Hut by 8:20am. We wondered what would happen if we showed up before breakfast was officially over at 8:30am to get our free pastries. But all the guests were already done, so they gave us some of the left over oatmeal and pancakes. What a deal!
All fueled up, we headed back to the trail. It continued to descend on a fairly rocky trail for about 0.2 miles, then it turned into the most magnificent trail we have hiked on this trip. You see it in today's picture. We have complained about the trail so much, we thought it would be good to show that there are some good parts too! And the best part is the good trail went on and on. We have shifted from taking a break every hour to taking a break every 1.5 hours. So you can imagine our surprise when we took our first break after Zealand Falls Hut, that we had traveled 3 miles from it and already 4.7 miles for the day...and it was only 10:30am. Unfortunately the trail soon started to cross boggy areas and it became a rock-hopping, plank-walking experience. Even so we only had 1.9 miles to go after our last break, all downhill.
One of the things we talked about on our last break was the lack of trail magic in New Hampshire.  Trail magic can take many forms, but the kind we were talking about is someone leaving food or drinks for hikers where the trail crosses a road. Its amazing what a cold soda, crisp apple or a cookie will do to the spirit of a hiker. In every other state we had found trail magic at many road crossings. But so far in New Hampshire absolutely nothing! Ironically when we reached the bottom of our descent, there sat a cooler with cold beer. Oops, spoke to soon!
Since our plan was to get to town to have real food, we passed up the trail magic and continued to US 302 at Crawford Notch. Now we faced a situation that had been building for the last couple of days.  Spider had arranged, before leaving home, for a shuttle service to pick us up at Crawford Notch and take us to the town of Gorham, N.H, per our schedule on Thursday Aug 9. But since we didn't take our planned 2nd Zero Day a week ago at the Hikers Welcome Hostel, we were day ahead of schedule. Unfortunately when Spider contacted the shuttle service from a mountaintop a couple of days ago, they could not accommodate the new date.
So Plan B was to make our way 3 miles down US 302 to AMC's Highland Lodge and catch their shuttle to Gorham. Hitchhiking would be an option, although ET is reluctant to do so. Walking the 3 miles is very doable, but on top of the already 9.5 miles hiked, we were not looking forward to it either.
We reached US 302 at 2:20pm, one of our fastest days so far. A lady was sitting in a van with a bunch of hikers sitting around the van. As we walked up the lady asked if we wanted a cold soda. After a hot hike downhill and a prospect of a 3 mile hike ahead of us, you bet we each had one! The van was covered with stickers and doodads about hiking and the AT. It was obvious that the lady was a Trail Angel...a person who helps hikers out of the goodness of their heart. On our hikes we have seen Trail Angels transport hikers to town, open up their homes, feed hikers, etc.
As Spider stood next to the van drinking his cold Dr. Pepper, he heard another hiker ask if the lady would transport him to a nearby town. She said ""Sure, hop in"". So Spider asked if she was going anywhere near the Highlands Lodge...""Sure, Hop in""....Wahoo!
At 2:40pm we were dropped in front of the Highlands Lodge...Thanks Janet, we take back all the bad things we said about trail magic in New Hampshire! We found that we were too late for the shuttle. So we asked if the Lodge had a room available. They had one left. It was meant to be! 
Our first order of business was a SHOWER! ET and I carry 1 top and 1 pair of pants that are clean. That is what we will wear day and night until we can do laundry. Next we found the bar and ordered some adult beverages. Happy Hour was on, so we started munching away. We met a very interesting guy who is also section-hiking the AT, trail name ""Bumpy"", who was almost 70 years old..a kindred spirit! Dinner and breakfast were included with our room, so our next stop was the dining room to munch some more.
After dinner Spider phoned the Inn where we planned to stay for 3 nights. ""Sorry, all full""..so was the next place he called...Uh Oh! He finally pieced together a stay in Gorham at a motel for tomorrow and Friday, then moving to a hiker hostel on Saturday. Not optimum but workable.
So why 3 zero days? Several months ago Spider made reservations in the Huts on the approach and exit of Mt. Washington.  To hike over Mt. Washington requires 3+ days and most of it is above treeline and exposed to the weather extremes. Staying in a hut guarentees a protected, dry place at the end of each day. However to get the 3 huts on consecutive days, Spider had to extend our plan by a couple of days. So instead of 1 day of rest we get 3. We'll suffer through it!!
Once the Gorham arrangements were made, it was back our room. To bed at 9pm.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600119,"It rained last night, heavily for about 30 minutes. But we didn't care because we were snug in our lodge room. ET was up at 6am and was soon out hunting for coffee. She found it in the lobby where she settled in to enjoy her morning. Spider was up at 6:30am and met ET in the lobby where he had his first cup of coffee. So this is how civilized people live!
After planning our morning, we grabbed another cup of coffee and headed to the dining room for breakfast. No Tang or oatmeal, instead bacon, eggs, pancakes, milk and more. This is how a Zero Day should start. After breakfast we went back to our room and packed up for shutte travel. We checked out and waited outside for our 9am shuttle. 
The AMC shuttle arrived on time and off we went. The shuttle had 2 stops before heading to Gorham. Both stops were at trailheads that gave access to one of the AMC huts. We have noticed that all the huts have an access trail that is the quickest, easiest way to get to the hut and is the way most the overnight guest get there. By the way, the AT is never the easiest way to get to a hut! As an example, on our next planned day of hiking we will need to hike 6.8 miles and gain 3800 feet to get to Mitzpah Springs Hut. From the trailhead at the Highland Center it is 2.6 miles and 2500 foot gain to Mitzpah Springs Hut.
We finally made it to Gorham at 10:30am and the driver dropped us off in front of our hotel. Not unexpectedly, our room was not ready this early,  so we left our packs in the corner of their lobby area and headed out to do our town chores. Today's picture is of our motel.
We checked the local bus schedule and found we had 1.5 hours before the next bus came to take us to Walmart. Since it was lightly raining, we walked a couple blocks to the public library. We read the local newspaper to see what has been happening while we have been in the woods...18 fires burning in California, 600,000 acres burned so far and 1/3 of the state in smoke. Hmm, not sure we are missing much.
A few minutes before the bus was scheduled to arrive, we went to the area of the bus stop and boarded the bus when it arrived. 10 minutes later we were at Walmart. 
We did our shopping, including buying lunch. As we waited for the bus to return, we sat on the grass and ate lunch. At 1:55pm the bus returned and droped us off at the Post Office. We went in and our resupply box was there..Whew!
We got back to the motel a 2:30pm and our room was still not ready. So we hung out in the lobby. When it was ready at 3pm we headed to the room to kick back and relax.
Our Zero Day physical assessment has us still in pretty good shape. A few scraps and scratches, but no blisters on our feet, no strained muscles and we continue to feel stronger. We keep track of our falls and Spider is ""winning"" with 4 to ET's 2. No permanent damage due to falls except to our egos and to one of Spider's trekking poles!
While watching golf, Spider began reviewing the plan for next week's hike and found a significant error. All plans for returning to the trail were based on a series of reservations at the next 3 huts starting on Sunday.  But in reviewing the reservations, the reservations started on SATURDAY not Sunday. Spider contacted the shuttle service asking if we could move our pickup from Sunday to Saturday morning...Nope! Spider called several other shuttle services but they were already committed.
So we came up with a new plan. We will use the same AMC shuttle service tomorrow, Friday, to take us back to Crawford Notch. It will get us back to within 0.5 miles of the AT at 1pm. Then we will hike in several miles and find a place to steath camp. That positions us for a reasonably short day on Saturday to get to the first hut, Mitzpah Springs Hut, the day for which we have our reservation. Unfortunately that shortens our rest time, and means we will need to add a couple extra meals to our packs and our hiking ""week"" goes from 7 to 8 days. Ugh!
We had a great dinner at a nearby restaurant, then ET hit the laundromat to wash our clothes (boy did they need it!) while Spider made all the phone calls including cancelling our reservations in Gorham for Friday and Saturday nights. After that we inventoried our food to see what extra we needed and then sprayed our clothes with Permithrin to discourage ticks from hanging around. It was all the things we had planned to leisurely do over the next couple of days, before the change of plans!

It's going to be a while, so need to enjoy it while we can. Next on the list was to pack our packs and in the process we repaired a couple things. Then it was off to breakfast. The Inn had recommended a cafe just down the road, Welsh's. It was a great place, good selection of food, large portions and 50's music blaring from the speakers! Back to our room by 9am. Spider called AMC to confirm the shuttle stop location and time and to see if we could make a reservation. No same day reservations so we were ""walk-ons"". The lady confirmed the shuttle was not full..Whew!
We killed time in our room until 10:30am, then headed to the AMC shuttle stop. The shuttle arrived about 11am and we were headed back to Crawford Notch..albiet a little sooner than we were planning when we left there yesterday!
Ironically, two of the hikers on the bus live in Del Mar, CA, close to where ET grew up. We shared all sorts of stories of hiking in Cuyamaca and the High Sierra. 
There was a 30 minute stop at the Highland Center Lodge so the shuttle driver could get lunch. We took advantage of the stop to pick up some snacks for lunch and the trail and Spider called his Mom. Our plans to Facetime with our sons and their families while on a 3-day rest in Gorgan were foiled by our change of plans. At 12:50pm the shuttle continued to the Webster Cliffs trailhead and the AT. We bailed out of the shuttle and hit the trail at 1:05pm.
The trail crossed a stream over a bridge then immediately began to climb and climb. Over the course of the next 2.5 hours we climbed 1650 ft in 1.9 miles, parts of it very steep. We took it slowly because we were carrying 8 days of food and extra water since we would be ""dry"" camping (i.e. not camping next to a water source). With most of the landscape being vertical, there we no places to stealth camp until we reached the top of the cliffs at 3:30pm. There things flattened out and there was a great viewpoint. Today's picture is of ET checking out the views. 
We decided that this would be a good place to stop for the day. We are now well positioned to make it to Mitzpah Springs Hut tomorrow at a reasonable time. We relaxed for a while then set up the tent. Spider took a snooze while ET read...now this is the way to hike! We got out of the tent at 6pm to fix dinner.  Another couple had set up their tent nearby. I guess we were not the only ones with the great idea of staying at this pretty location. Interestingly the temperature has dropped significantly. It's now in the low 50's with wind blowing. Wouldn't you know it just as we are approaching the challenging Mt. Washington. We are carrying several cold weather layers and this is the first time we've had to use them. Good thing the next 3 nights are in huts.

The trail immediately started to climb and soon turned into a hand-over-hand climb up vertical rocks. All the way up the ridge of Webster Cliffs to the top of Mt. Webster the trail alternated between rocky trail and rocky climb, with a few rocky descents thrown in. A periodic reward was rock outcropping views to the valley below, similar to yesterday's picture. 
We finally made it to the top of Mt. Webster by 9:30am for our breakfast break. For the first time we had a good view of Mt. Washington, which is today's picture. If all goes as planned we will cross over it the day after tomorrow. 
After breakfast,  we headed down the mountain. Once again it was near vertical in many places. With several more ups and downs to negotiate, we eventually made our way to Mt. Jackson. On top were a croud of dayhikers who had come up a side trail from the valley below. We passed people eating pizza and others eating Subway sandwiches. Hmm... Our nuts and jerky don't look so good anymore! 
From the top of Mt. Jackson we had an even better view of Mt. Washington with its array of antennas.  We could also see our destination, Mizpah Spring Hut, 1.7 miles away...Wahoo!
Another steep descent off the mountain and then several ups and downs in a boggy area. We saw a lot of dayhikers in this area. We could tell we were getting close to the hut. We finally arrived a little before 1pm.
We checked in and were assigned to bunkroom 5. It has 8 bunks, two high in the room. We grabbed a couple, then went down to the dining room. Our orange card allowed us a free soup, so we took it! Drinks are free for guests, so we enjoyed some lemonade. So now what? Go on a hike?...I don't think so! We walked around the outside looking for chairs or hammocks...nothing. I guess people come here to hike not relax! So we headed back to our bunks and ""moved in"". 
We read most the afternoon until the other hikers came back from their dayhikes. Then we got into conversations with them. A big thing in the Northeast is to hike to the top of all 48 mountains over 4,000 ft in New Hampshire. We have met others along the way whom were there doing just that, and this hut was certainly no exception (because several ""4,000ers"" are nearby).
At 5pm we went to the dining room to be more sociable, but were tossed out by the Croo at 5:30pm so they could set the tables for dinner. Dinner was served at 6pm. It consisted of black bean soup, salad, roast turkey with mash potatoes and gravy, green peas and chocolate cake for desert. That was sure better than a freeze-dried dinner. What is amazing is that all of this had to be carried up the mountain on the backs of the staff. They said they go down twice a week, carrying out trash and bringing back food for the next several days. 
The Croo introduced themselves between the main course and dessert. All are twenty-something and this is their summer job. Most are in college or have just graduated. They rotate cooking, cleaning and set-up chores and seem to really enjoy it since most have been doing this for several seasons.
The meal is served family style on long tables set for 14 people. Through the course of the meal you get to know the people around you. Most are here doing 4,000ers. One was a family of 4 getting their kids away from computers and into nature.
After dinner we hung around talking for a while then headed to bed at 8pm.
The day had started out partly cloudy but had turned to competely cloudy with a chance of rain. We will hope for a change for the better since we will be hiking exposed ridges above treeline most of tomorrow!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600368,"We were already awake when the Croo started singing to us that it was time to get up. We got up and did a little organizing/prepacking. It was a grey, foggy morning and it had rained during the night.
Breakfast was served at 7am. All the thru-hikers were hanging around the entry area because anything we don't eat, they get! Breakfast started with oatmeal with lots of different goodies to put on top. Next was eggs, bacon and pancakes...a much heartier breakfast than we usually eat! After breakfast we finished packing and hit the trail at 8:30am.
The trail immediately began to climb steeply. The interesting difference from leaving a hut vs leaving a shelter is that since everyone in the hut eats at the same time,  everyone leaves about the same time. Not so with a shelter. So as we headed out, the trail was pretty busy until it sorted itself out, based on hiking speed. Many of the hut guests were heading our way because they wanted to ""bag"" a 4000er, Mt. Pierce, about a mile away. 
After a 300 foot climb the trail became more level. Of course once at the top Mt. Pierce we could not see a thing because of the fog. Soon after the top, a side trail took off heading for the valley below and most of the mass of people left us as we continued on the AT.
The temperature was 54 degrees and the wind was blowing the damp fog at about 20 mph... not bad hiking weather.  Spider was hiking in shorts and a long-sleeved shirt and ET was hiking in long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. We were confortable, as long as we kept moving!!
After Mt. Pierce came Mt. Eisenhower,  then Mt. Clinton and finally Mt. Monroe.  In some cases the trail went over the top, in other cases it went around the side with a side trail to the top. With the cool temperatures, we didn't need our normal break every 1 to 1.5 hours, so we hiked for 2 hrs before our first break. At our break we determined we were halfway to the Lake of the Clouds Hut...Wahoo!
1 hour 45 minutes later the Lake of the Clouds Hut appeared out of the clouds. How appropriate! That is our picture of the day. The timing was good because the mist was turning to rain. We checked in and were assigned a bunkroom. We were the first to arrive in our bunkroom so we had our pick. After moving in we cleaned up a little, then sat down to a bowl of potato-dill soup and a hot drink. We were glad to be inside since it appeared the rain had intensified outside. Things were not looking good for getting any views from Mt. Washington tomorrow. At least the forecast is for mild winds. After lunch, we went to our bunks to relax, read and warm up. 
Dinner was at 6pm. Turkey soup (I bet they had roast turkey for yesterday's dinner too!), salad, stuffed pasta shells, peas, homemade bread and chocolate carrot cake for dessert. It's going to be tough to go back to regular backpacking meals!
The windows of the dining room have grand views overlooking the valley 4000 feet below, on a clear day. What we had when we sat down was a view that looked like someone had pasted white paper over the windows. However, halfway through dinner several people jumped up and went outside to take pictures because the fog briefly lifted and we could see down into the valley. Just as quickly as it cleared, the fog came back, but maybe there is hope for tomorrow!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600506,"We awoke to a beautiful, clear day. Spider went outside and took a picture of Mt. Washington...not a cloud around it. The 7am weather report by the Croo said it was 52 degrees, 9 mph winds and visibility was 40 miles. We couldn't ask for a better day to visit the top of Mt. Washington! 
We ate breakfast, then packed up and hit the trail at 8am, and what did we find? The top of Mt. Washington was shrouded in clouds. Darn! We started our 1200 ft climb immediately. The last 600 ft of the climb was in a dense cloud where we hiked from one cairn to the next. We hardly knew we were at the top until we almost ran into a building.
A building? So it's time for a little bit about Mt. Washington and why getting over the top has been a focus of our hike since Day 1. Mt. Washington is the highest mountain in New Hampshire. More importantly it is known to have the worst weather in the US. It lies in an area of convergence of cold air dropping from Canada and moist air coming up from the Atlantic Ocean. The effects are dramatic. Winds have reached over 200 mph. It can and has snowed every month of the year. Standing out as much as it does, it can create it's own weather. And, like we saw today, the weather can change quickly. Earlier this year, thru-hikers had to wait in town for 6 days as a storm raged on Mt. Washington making it impassable. So our concern from Day 1 was whether Mother Nature was going to let us get over the top of Mt. Washington on schedule.
We arrived at the top at 9:30am. It was completely socked in, but the winds were calm. That is our picture of the day. We had to share the top with about 200 other people because it is also a tourist attraction and has been since the mid-1800s. There is a road up to the top from the north and a cog train to the top from the south. 
We left the top at 10am and continued our cairn-by-cairn hike down the other side of Mt. Washington. The trail was mostly rocks varying from the size of a breadbox to the size of a coffee table and continued that way the rest of the day.  So we had to concentrate on every step, making progress slow.
We soon crossed over the cog train tracks, then paralleled them for a distance. It was wierd hearing the train chugging very nearby, but not able to see it for all the fog. In the middle of the day we actually saw the sun and had some views, but that gave way to a light rain by 1:30pm. That made the rocky trail even more treacherous and slowed us down even more. We were beginning to wonder if we would reach the next hut in time for the 6pm dinner. Fortunately the rain only lasted for about 30 minutes and the rocks dried fairly quickly, with a 20mph wind blowing. The rain returned again at 4:30pm with a little more intensity but, once again only lasted for about 30 minutes.
We finally arrived at the Madison Spring Hut at 5:30pm. We had just enough time to clean up before dinner was served. We met some great thru-hikers and had a good time talking about hiking all over the world.
Today we passed over or around Mt. Clay, Mt. Jefferson, Mt. Adam's and best of all Mt. Washington. Wahoo!
To bed at 8pm. The forecast is for rain tomorrow. Yuk!","Lake of the Clouds Hut
",Madison Spring Hut,"Aug 13, Mon",7.10
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600507,"The forecast was rain by late morning, but when we woke up, it was raining. Mother Nature was saying ""You don't get out of the Whites without paying the Piper!"". We did a little prepacking in anticipation of our morning wakeup serenade by the Croo at 6:30am. But 6:30am came and went with no serenade. ET checked and there was no Croo activity in the kitchen...and worst of all, no coffee available! It appeared the Croo had overslept. ET and I decided we would just pull something out of our food for breakfast, eat it in the dining room then hit the trail. One of the other guests was less accommodating.  He opened the door to the crew living area and yelled ""Hey, We're hungry out here! Immediately members of the Croo came pouring out of their living area. Amazingly, at 7:05, just as we finished packing up, the Croo announced that breakfast was ready. So we had a regular Hut breakfast..Wahoo! We put on our rain jackets, put the rain covers on our packs and hit the trail at 8am.
The wind was blowing at about 15mph, the temperature was 54 degrees and it was raining steadily...a wonderful day for a hike. The trail immediately started steeply up a cascade of boulders on Mt. Madison.  Because it was steep and the boulders were wet, we took it very slowly. As described in an earlier journal posting, everyone tends to leave the Hut nearly at the same time, after breakfast. So soon we were passed by many of the hikers we had met. Then we were alone on the mountain. Today's picture is of our cairn-by-cairn hike up the mountain.
The problem was that the higher up we got, the stronger the wind and rain became. At one point the wind was blowing 30-40mph and the rain was going horizontal. We went over the top of Mt. Madison and began the rock scramble down the other side. We continued to plug along, but not taking breaks. Stopping and taking a break means chilling down and risking hyperthermia.  After 5 hours we were finally below treeline and out of the wind, so we took our first break. We had traveled a paltry 2.5 miles! We were concerned about making dinner at Joe Dodge Lodge at Pinkham Notch. They only serve it between 5:30pm and 7:30pm. It was 1pm and we still had 5.3 miles to go.
After our break, we traveled 0.5 more miles on a steep, rocky trail before it eased a little. During this time the rain stopped and we actually saw the sun. Mother Nature had given us a great sendoff from the Mt. Washington mountain complex.
Even with a slightly better trail, we were still having trouble maintaining much more than 1.0 mph. So dinner was still questionable since we needed to take a few more breaks, given our strenuous morning. 
Towards the end of the day, we crossed the access road to Mt. Washington...yesterday the cog train tracks and today the road! Soon after that, the trail headed down Old Jackson Rd. It was an abandoned dirt road that was washed out in several places but where it wasn't,  the grade was gentle and the surface fairly smooth. This allowed us to stride out and increase our mph. Old Jackson Rd saved our ""bacon"" because we made it to Joe Dodge Lodge at 5:45pm.
We took showers (Mmmm), put on some dry clothes and headed to the dining room at 6:30pm. We clinked our water glasses and toasted that we had finally finished the 500 mile section of the AT that we started 2 years ago but couldn't finish because of Spider's knee issues. After eating everything in sight, we went back to our room and were finally able to get horizontal...Ahhh!
This was probably our hardest day of hiking. Climbing South Kinsman was the hardest climbing we have ever done, but today's putting one foot in front of the other was the hardest, so far...10 hours of hiking, 2900 foot descent and only 2 breaks. We will sleep well tonight!
Tomorrow we have a 2500 ascent...and, of course, there is a chance of rain again!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600654,"We awoke at 6am and began organizing our gear. At 6:30am we went to the dining room for breakfast, then back to our room to finish packing. We hit the trail at 8am. 
First we had to cross busy Highway 16, then the trail paralleled the highway for a mile passing by Lost Lake. Finally we met the Wild Cat Trail and started to climb...almost straight up for 1000 ft. Our trekking poles became a liability because we needed our hands to grab on to rocks and trees to pull ourselves up. We let the poles dangle from their wrist straps,  but sometimes they got in the way of our feet or got caught in the rocks or trees. Other times they were handy to have, so we kept them on our wrists. Today's picture is one of the more gnarly parts of the climb...not sure how they can call this a ""trail""!
Along the way, we had a viewpoint where we looked across the valley to the top of Mt. Washington.  At a later viewpoint we could not see the top anymore because of thunder clouds, but could see the road going up to it.
After 6 hours we had gone 3 miles, a slow day. We arrived at a gondola that services skiers in the winter and sightseers in the summer. We had a similar experience to arriving at the top of Mt. Washington.  We had worked our tails off to get to this point and were all sweaty and tired...and then we find people getting off the gondola with a spring in their step and smelling all fresh and clean. What's wrong with this picture?
We only had about 6 miles to go for the day, but at the rate we were going we wouldn't arrive at our destination until almost dark!  Fortunately, the trail leveled out some, with shorter bursts of vertical climbs and some vertical descents. By our 4:30pm break we had 1.3 miles to go, but a lot of it was a steep descent.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600655,"Just as we were about to drop off to sleep last night, there was a flash of light in the sky then a rumble..Uh Oh! When the sun set, the sky was clear. We left off the tent rain cover, so we could watch the stars. Needless to say, after this warning we jumped out of the tent and put the rain cover on. After getting back in, we watched the tent periodically light up followed by deep rumbles. Within 30 minutes it began to rain, on and off all night. When we woke at 6am there was a brief shower, but none after that. The wind was blowing. We packed up and hit the trail at 7:10 am.
We descended into Carter Notch and soon passed a big pond. We haven't seen many lakes or ponds this year, so decided to make it the picture of the day. After the pond, we started our major climb of the day 1500 ft up to Carter Dome. We were worried it might be a repeat of yesterday's climb up Wild Cat, but it was a little tamer. There were still several places where we had to climb using hands and feet, but not as much. Even so, after 2 hours we had only gone 1.3 miles. We were wondering if we were going to be able to make it to our destination of Imp Shelter, another 6 miles away.
Fortunately once we reached the top of Carter Dome, the trail became much easier. Our only problem was that we had planned to fill our water bottles from a spring on the side of Carter Dome...but we never saw itWe still had some water left so figured we would wait until the next water indicated on our map, 1.7 miles away. 
The clouds finally left and we ended with a clear, sunny day. The winds continued to blow,  with 20-30 mph gusts and the temperatures stayed cool..in the 50s. We really noticed this when we climbed to the exposed Mt. Hight around midday...great views, but chilly!
After finding the next water source to be unacceptable, we decided to try to make it on what we had. The trail turned very tame as we climbed South Carter Mtn., then Middle Cater Mtn. and finally North Carter Mtn. Spider ran out of water on North Carter Mtn with 1.6 miles to go! 
We were making very good time and looking forward to getting into camp early. Then we began our 700 ft descent of North Carter Mtn. It was like descending the Wild Cat we had climbed the previous day. It was a nearly vertical descent. In one place there was a vertical wall 30 ft high with cracks in it for toe holds and finger holds. Never assume anything about the trail when hiking in the Whites! ET ran out of water on the descent with 0.8 miles to go.
Needless to say this really slowed us down. Even so we made it to Imp Shelter by 5:30pm. We set out our wet tent to dry a little before setting it up and moving in. Then we filtered some water and had a long, slow drink..Ahhh!
Tomorrow we head out of the Whites. We wonder what surprises are in store for us. On top of that, it is supposed to rain..Ugh! The good thing is we are getting off the trail to resupply and give our bodies some rest.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600895,"The threat of rain had us a little nervous given that we had a 700 ft ascent then a 3300 ft descent for the day. The first thing we did, when we woke at a little before 6am, was check the weather forecast. It had changed from ""a chance of rain beginning at 2pm"" to ""a chance of rain beginning at 7am"". We hate to pack our packs in the rain or to carry a wet tent, so we quickly jumped out of the tent and packed up. We hit the trail at 6:50 am under clear skies.
First was the climb of 700 ft. up Mt. Moriah. The trail was at a fairly good angle so we made good time until we reached the rock slabs, which is today's picture. We probably had 1/2 mile of easy slab walking. The nice thing was we had great views (still no sign of rain..Wahoo!). We finally reached the top and began our 3300ft descent. The ascent had only a couple of short areas where we had to use our hands instead of our poles and the descent was the same way. The descent was a steep trail, but it was a trail! 
Given the threat of rain in the forecast we were only taking breaks every 2 hours; and given that the trail was actually a TRAIL, we were making some good distance between breaks. With about 3.5 miles to go, the trail crossed the Rattle River and began to follow an old road. With a more gentle slope and a generally smoother surface we were able to pick up our speed. That was good because the sky was now overcast and a freshening wind said that rain was on the way.
We made it to US 2, our destination, by 2:45pm. We hiked up the highway a 1/4 mile to the Rattle River Hostel and Lodge. It had been our intent to stay there, so we had our resupply box sent there. Fortunately, when Spider had called yesterday to confirm the box was there and to reserve a room, he found out the box was there (Thanks, Ginny for mailing the box!), but unfortunately, no bunks or rooms were available. Spider phoned a couple other hostels only to find they were also full. With the impending rain, hikers bail off the trail like rats abandoning a sinking ship! So in desperation Spider phoned the same motel we had stayed at a week ago, the Royalty Inn. Being about the most expensive motel in town means its rooms are the last to go. Sure enough, they had a room available. Wahoo!
We stopped by the Rattle River Hostel to pick up our resupply box and to ask about transportation for the 3+ miles to Gorham. The hostel provided a shuttle service to Gorham but only at 2pm and 6pm. We didn't want to we sit around for 3 hrs waiting for their shuttle. The proprietress said most hikers hitchhike to town, that locals are pretty good about giving rides. So with darkening skies, we grabbed our box and headed back to US 2. We decided to walk toward Gorham and have ET stick her thumb out any time a vehicle approached. After a 1/4 mile of walking down the road and about 40 vehicles passing us by, we were beginning to think we might be walking all the way to Gorham. Fortunately, just as we were thinking this, a pickup pulled over and offered us a ride...Whew! We put our packs in back and just as we crawled into the cab, it began to rain. How is that for timing?
The driver was a local who split his time between New Hampshire and Montana. He said he often picked up hikers and took them to Gorham. Through conversation it turned out he knew of our hometown, Orinda, because he had friends who live there..small world! Thanks to this Trail Angel for saving our feet from having an added 3 mile walk and for letting us stay dry.
We arrived at our motel at 3:30pm. After checking in, the first order of business was a SHOWER! Next was the first load of laundry.  Then we got horizontal. At 6pm we headed to a local pizza place for food and libations. We were back in our room by 7:30pm. We watched TV and killed time until 9pm, when we had arranged a phone call with our oldest son. Once the called was over, it was bedtime. It was way past hiker's midnight!
Animal sighting:  We saw our first grouse as we were going over Mt. Moriah. We had heard other hikers talk about them but we had yet to see one. They are noted for jumping onto the trail in front of you with a flutter of wings (scaring you half to death!) then running down the trail. What they are doing is protecting their chicks through distraction. The chicks were somewhere near where the grouse jumped on the trail. By running down the trail the grouse is expecting the threat (us!) to follow her...away from the chicks!

In fact today's picture is of our motel room strewn with packs etc. When we move in, we move in! We got dressed, putting on our raincoats, and walked to a nearby cafe, Welsh's, that we had found last time we were in Gorham (the one with the 50's music).
After breakfast, ET got to work on our second load of laundry and we both started going through our packs, getting rid of trash, incorporating the contents of the resupply box and collecting things to send home. Now that we are through the Whites, there is no need for cold weather gear.
ET started calling family while Spider took the stuff to send home to the post office. Upon his return, Spider began to work the issue of getting back to the AT tomorrow. We didn't want to depend on hitchhiking early on a Sunday morning. Spider lucked out on his call. It was to the guy who was scheduled to pick us up at Crawford Notch a week ago,  but couldn't reschedule when we were arriving a day early. This time he was free, so we are scheduled to be picked up tomorrow morning at 7am.
The rain was on and off in the morning and intense at times, but by the afternoon it was just overcast. We have been watching all the weather forecasts and everyone seems to agree that the next several days will be nice weather. We sure hope so.
Our report on our physical condition is still good. No blisters on our feet, no damaged body parts. We continue to get stronger so that we can go longer between breaks. Spider's new knee is performing great. It's now his ""strong"" leg. His other knee is okay as long as he wears his brace. We are both losing weight as indicated by having to continue to tighten our belts more to keep our pants up! Also Spider has had to adjust his knee brace twice, as the leg becomes more muscle and less fat! ET is now leading the count in falls 6 to 5. Last week was not a good week for her!
We have been disappointed in animal sightings. You will note from previous journal entries that all we have only seen a couple of deer and a grouse in three weeks...not counting lots of chipmunks.  We had hoped to see lots more wildlife, specially a moose. So far all we have seen are moose droppings!
Bugs have not been a problem. Some of it is because of wind and rain. But mostly it is because we have been at higher elevations. Anytime we drop below about 1500 feet elevation, the pesky gnats or black flies become a problem. They want to fly into our eyes and ears. The worst we have had it was hitching on US 2. We felt like we were walking in a cloud of gnats/black flies!

After that we walked back to the motel and finished packing. At 6:45am we walked out of our room only to find the shuttle service guy waiting out front. So we checked out and hit the road. We were dropped off at the Rattle River Hostel, where we had started our hitchhiking adventure the day before. We hit the trail at 7am.
The ""trail"" started out as a road-walk first. We walked down North Rd. then Hogan Rd. for 1/2 mile, then began our 1700 ft climb. The trail was a normal trail that worked it's way up the mountain. We were rewarded once we got to the top with views in all directions. We had climbed above the fog from the valley below. Today's picture is of ET at one of our first viewpoints. I say ""first viewpoint""  because the day was full of ups and downs, but after almost every climb we were rewarded with a viewpoint on a rock outcropping.  This has not been the case with most days. Normally we have been stuck in the ""green tunnel"" or the white cloud. 
The trail, for the most part was easy, with only a few places where we needed our hands to climb down. One thing we are seeing more is bogs since leaving the crest of the Whites. These are areas that have deep mud or standing water. Many have plank walkways constructed by trail maintenance crews to keep you above the muck. Unfortunately some areas don't have planks, so we spend our time trying to find our way around or through the mines. These bogs can appear anywhere, in the valleys or at the top of the mountains. All that is needed is a flat area that has collected water, forest duff and many footsteps.
Something else we saw more of today was ponds. We passed by 4 . That may be more in one day than in the whole of our trip so far! We wonder if bogs and ponds are harbingers of what Maine is going to be like.
We finally arrived at the shelter at 6:15pm..a long day and higher mileage than usual. The water source is a beaver pond - Gentian Pond. We had been warned in New York to treat beaver pond water well to prevent ""beaver fever"" so we filtered this water AND Iodized it. To bed at 9pm.

Success. 1300 ft pretty steeply up, but nothing requiring our hands. That happened when we started down the other side of Mt. Success.  There were several areas that were very steep with big rocks.
One area was a rockfall with rocks the size of refrigerators.  It took all our ingenuity to navigate down. Spider took advantage of his long reach while ET used her canvas-augmented hiking pants to slide down some of the bigger ones.
This rockfall was New Hampshire saying ""goodbye"" since soon after that we came to the New Hampshire/ Maine border. Wahoo! That is today's picture. We have completed 13 of 14 of the states traversed by the AT.
It didn't take Maine very long to welcome us. Within 1/2 mile of the border we came to a rockfall with even BIGGER rocks. This one included a slot between two huge boulders which Spider and his pack barely made it through.
Next we worked our way up to a ridge the gave us great views for several miles along its crest. We also came across some impressive bogs. Fortunately trail crews had put plank bridges across them because the mud was 2-3 ft deep!
Then we came to East Goose Eye Mtn. To get to the top was only a 200ft climb but it was vertical using re-bar steps in the wall and wooden ladders. Definitely not a Sunday stroll!
After another ridge walk, we finally arrived at the shelter at 7:10pm...12 hours of hiking..Whew!
The reason we have been forcing some big miles the last couple days is to position ourselves close to Mahoosuc Notch. It is now about 1.5 miles away. Mahoosuc Notch is known as the ""hardest mile"" on the AT. Oh Boy.  More on that tomorrow!

We started with a climb that involved some steep parts requiring our hands, and then a steep descent into Mahoosuc Notch.
When we started this year's hike Spider was worried about completing 2 things 1) hiking over Mt. Washington, and 2) getting through Mahoosuc Notch. Imagine a gap between 2 mountains with vertical rock walls. Over time, rocks break off and fall into the gap. The size of the rocks vary from refrigerator to motorhome. Now imagine a trail through this gap, aka notch...that's Mahoosuc Notch. I mentioned it is titled ""The Hardest Mile on the AT"". To negotiate these boulders we had to climb over, crawl under or work our way around them. There was a lot of arm work pulling ourselves up big rocks and a lot of sliding down the other side. It took us 3 hours to navigate the 1 mile of the notch. We felt like we used every muscle in our bodies!
What we didn't anticipate was the climb up Mahoosuc Arm mountain. It's a 1600 ft climb that has large portions that are straight up. The Whites came back! Our poles were useless as we grabbed boulders and trees to help pull us up. Several of the southbound hikers had warned us that southern Maine was as tough or tougher than the Whites. Today proved them right. It took us 2.5 hours to hike the 1.6 miles up Mahoosuc Arm.
We finally arrived at the shelter at 5:45pm. We are staying in the shelter tonight because rain is predicted for tonight and tomorrow.  We usually prefer tenting because it's quieter and more private. But when it's raining, its easier to dress and pack up in a shelter and we're not carrying a wet tent! To bed at 8pm.","Full Goose Shelter
",Speck Pond Shelter,"Aug 21, Tue",5.10
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601347,"Unfortunately the forecast was right and we woke up to rain. We were happy we stayed in the shelter. We packed up and then went to the cooking area to fix breakfast. No hiking for an hour then eating breakfast in the rain! After breakfast we hit the trail at 8am.
We immediately began to climb. We needed to climb 500 ft to get over Old Speck Mtn. There were some fairly steep sections made more difficult by the rain. The water was a river running down the trail. Where it leveled out the mud bogs became lakes. There was no hope of keeping our feet dry. Near the top the trail became granite slab walls. Unfortunately many of these were out in the open allowing the full fury of the wind and rain to hit us...and that is today's picture! We were happy to get over the top and back into the protection of the trees. Next we had a 3500 ft descent to Grafton Notch.
Going down in the rain carries a whole new set of hazards...roots are slick, rocks can be slick and the water is flooding the trail. However, just like our hike over Mt. Madison in the rain, we had to keep moving to keep hypothermia from setting in. Fortunately as we worked our way lower, the temperature warmed up from the low 50's to the high 50's. So after hiking for 4 hours we finally stopped for 5 minutes to eat a little lunch to keep the energy up, then back to the trail.
We've been surprised by the cold rain. We expected hot and humid weather, with warm rains. Except for our first day on the trail, we have only experienced cold rains much like we get in the winter in California.
By 1:30pm we finally reached the Grafton Notch parking lot. Who should greet us but a Trail Angel, Miss Moose, saying she had been waiting for ET and Spider! Turns out one of the hikers who had stayed in the shelter with us last night and who had preceded us down the mountain, had alerted her that we were coming down soon. So Miss Moose offered us hot chocolate (Wow did that hit the spot!), a ham sandwich, chips, banana and chocolate covered almonds.  Sure better than the lunch we had planned. She said she had already taken several hikers to town, one who was hypothermic.  Best yet, she pointed out a garbage can where we got rid of all the garbage we had been accumulating the last 3+ days.
The rain had stopped by the time we went back on the trail and began our 1200 ft climb. In fact, the sun actually peeked out a couple times. So the storm was over...not! At 4pm a squall surprised us, getting our raingear all wet again. The trail still was wet and had all the rain related slipping hazards but no rivers of water. 
We made it to our destination by 4:40pm. Amazing how much a good trail and only taking a few breaks can make a difference in mph. You will note the change in terminology. We are now staying in a ""leanto"" instead of a ""shelter"". The term ""shelter"" is used throughout the AT except from here on... to Katahdin Mtn...the end of the AT.
We hung our wet gear in the shelter to begin drip-drying out and got into dry clothes.  After getting water and a few housekeeping chores were done, we crawled into our sleeping bags to warm up. We got back out long enough to eat dinner then to bed at 8pm. Forecast is for a nice day tomorrow...works for us!","Speck Pond Shelter
",Baldpate Leanto,"Aug 22, Wed",6.80
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601348,"Well it was a good thing we opted for the shelter because it poured rain around midnight! We awoke to a cloudy, cold, windy day. One of the thrills the next morning after a rainy day is putting on your wet hiking clothes, especially this morning with the wind blowing and the temps in the mid 40's. We carry 2 sets of clothes, one for hiking and one for inside the tent or shelter. This keeps our pack weight down, but sometimes means we wear wet hiking clothes. We put off putting them on until as late in the packing process as possible,  but eventually we bite the bullet and put them on... Burrrrr!
We hit the trail at 7:30am and, fortunately, we immediately started our 1000 ft climb up West Baldpate Mtn. It was a steep climb but most of it had rock steps constructed by trail maintenance crews. It was like taking the stairs to the top of the Empire State Building.  All the while, the cold wind blew hard and dried out our clothes. 
When we got to the top, the sun was just starting to break through the clouds. We found a rock in the sun and out of the wind and had breakfast. By the time we finished breakfast,  the clouds were gone and all we had was sun and wind. We descended steeply down the other side of West Baldplate Mtn and then across a fairly open slab area to East Baldpate Mtn. We were exposed to the brunt of the wind and it was pushing us around. Then we started climbing East Baldpate Mtn., which was a 600 ft climb on open slab rock. That is our picture of the day. The higher we got, the harder the wind blew. At the top the gusts were so hard we had to use our trekking poles to stay standing.  We were happy to finally get back into the protection of the trees.
We descended 1500 ft that was so steep in some places, we had to use ladders. One ladder even had a rope assist. Fortunately as we descended it got warmer. Near the bottom we could actually take off our windbreakers/rain jackets. Another 1000 ft climb and we finally had cell service for the first time in 2 days, so we sent off our journals. Then another 1500 ft decent, but this trail was much more reasonably graded. 
Finally a 600ft ascent to Surplus Pond. We arrived at 6:45pm. A little later than we like, but we positioned ourselves to finish our section tomorrow with 8.2 miles over 2 peaks. Unfortunately one of them is said to require a ""technical"" climb..Oh Boy! However once we are over them we, are headed into Andover, Maine for a Zero Day...Wahoo.

",Stealth camp near Surplus Pond,"Aug 23, Thu",9.90
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601685,"Yesterday when we arrived at  Surplus Pond, we met a couple people with a car (there was a gravel road to the pond) who asked if we'd seen a runner in a yellow shirt? Odd question, but said we had not. We moved on down the road a little way and set up camp near a spring. Today we found out that someone is running the AT trying to break the record of 46 days and we had met his support crew. We have been working on completing the AT for 6 years and we are still not done while this guy is on pace to do it in 43 days...Amazing! However the impact on us was that we were still close enough to hear lots of noise when he arrived around 9pm (running in the dark on uneven ground with a headlamp!!?) and at 4am when the car started up and the support team left
Knowing we had a tough climb coming up and wanting to make sure to get off the trail at a reasonable time, we set the alarm for 5am. It was still fairly dark, so we had to start our packing with headlamps. However by 6:15am when we hit the trail, it was light enough to see just fine. The day was clear and no wind...Wahoo!
We immediately began to climb, but gradually. We had planned to go for 2 hours before our breakfast break, but after 1 hour agreed that we both were dragging and needed some energy boost. After breakfast we had a lot more pep and quickly finished the 900 ft climb of Wyman Mtn.
After a gentle descent of Wyman Mtn., we had a rollercoaster climb to Hall Lean-to which was empty. After the lean-to, the fun began. We had a steep descent into Sawyer Notch via switchbacks and rock steps. During this time we were passed by 4 people going the other way slackpacking...3 of which we had seen yesterday going north. Apparently the thing to do is leave the trail via East B Rd which we crossed yesterday,  go to an Andover hostel for the night, then slackpack SOUTH (to avoid the tough climb coming up) from the road we were now going to, South Arm Rd, back to East B Rd...why didn't we think of that?
By 11:15am we reached the bottom of Sawyer Notch and took our first lunch break. We are fairly consistently hiking 3 hours now between breaks. Here a southbounder came by and stopped to talk. He was 60 years old and had just finished circumnavigating the US by bike (Seattle, WA to Portland, ME to Key West, FL to San Diego, CA to Seattle, WA) and that was after canoeing the whole length of the Mississippi River...now he was hiking the AT. You meet a lot of interesting people out here.
After our lunch break the 1300 ft ""technical"" climb up Moody Mtn. began...and it was a bust! Although very steep, it had all been engineered by trial crews with rock steps. In a few particularly steep areas, wooden ladders or rebar steps were used. The point is that it was engineered, not like our hike/climb up South Kinsman Mtn. or Wild Cat Mtn. in the Whites where they put an AT blaze up high on a 30 ft high rock wall and, in essence, say ""you figure out how to get up this""!
We reached the top of Moody Mtn. by 2pm. Based on Spider's earlier research, this was where he was asked to call the hostel for a shuttle ride. So Spider called and confirmed that there was room for us at the hostel and that a shuttle would be sent. We actually lucked out, in that there only private room was available and we grabbed it!
The descent was a fairly easy one and we arrived at South Arm Rd. by 3:30pm..our 4th week of hiking completed with only one more to go.
Hopper, our shuttle driver, first took us to a general store in Andover to pick up cold drinks and a bottle of wine for dinner...then off to The Cabin hostel, 3 miles outside of town, which is our picture of today.
This is a very different kind of histel than the last one we stayed in. Here you get a sense you are just one of the family. We are 2 of 5 hikers staying here...2 of which we passed going southbound today. Whenever we ask the cost of shower, clothes washing, meals, they just say ""included""!
So needless to say, the first thing we did was take a shower. We checked on our resupply box and it was here...Whew. Now we have the food to complete our hike. Thanks Ginny, for mailing our resupply box. After ET got the laundry started, we popped the cork on the bottle of wine and sat out back talking with the owners, who have been running the hostel since 1994.. Life doesn't get much better!
Honey and Bear (trail names) are the owners and in their 80's. They have dedicated themselves to the hiker community.  They provide trash cans at road crossings because the accumulation of trash (hike it in, hike it out!) is one of the hassles in long-distance backpacking. They provide toilet paper to the nearby shelter privys which are normally BYO-TP. If they see hikers, they shuttle them where they want to go...and much, much more. Amazing people.
Dinner was served at 6pm family style and all cooked by Honey...spaghetti w/ meatballs,  corn on the cob, green beans, salad, garlic toast and best of all, brownies smothered in ice cream. Hiker hunger (that hunger that never seems to go away) has kicked in so we both had seconds!
We sat around and talked for awhile then headed to our bedroom at 8:30pm. To bed at 9pm...in a real bed.

Today some people whom we met on the AT in 2014 and hiked with for a week in the Shenandoahs of Virginia, were to pick us up and take us to their cabin. So we packed up to move to a new place.
While we waited, ET used duct tape to repair the seat of her pants. The canvas patches worked great, but the seam between not so well.
At 9:30am Runaway and Grasshopper showed up and hauled us to their cabin on Worthly Pond in Peru, ME. We had a great day reminiscing about parts of the AT we all had hiked, about other hikes we had done and about family and friends. To top it off, they prepared a lobster feed, knowing we loved lobster. Amazingly they get lobster for about the same price we get steak in California! 
Physically we are still doing well...no blisters or bruises, only a few scratches. But we both are feeling the cumulative effects of day after day of hiking. The energy level doesn't seem to bounce back to the same level each morning. Hopefully this zero day will help.
The number of falls still has ET leading..now 9 to 7. Fortunately none have caused any damage.

We hit the road a little after 7am. We arrived at the trailhead at 8am. Hugs all around, then we headed up the trail.
We had a 2000 ft climb to the top of Old Blue Mtn.  Unfortunately, the first 750 ft were very steep. Welcome back to the trail! We caught a nice view back down to South Arm Rd., the road we came out to and then back to, for our resupply. It's today's photo. 
After completing the steep part, the climb became a stair step...flat, climb, flat, climb. However, as luck would have it, Spider pulled a muscle in his Gluteus Maximus (butt!) during the initial climb, so what was already a slow pace with full packs for the week, became even slower...Uh Oh! Hopefully he is a quick healer since this is our longest mileage week.
Once over Old Blue Mtn, we entered a boggy area with lots of mud holes to step around and made our way to Elephant Mtn. Lots of short ups and downs meant we never could get a good pace.
As we climbed Bemis Mtn. the clouds that had been building began to spit light rain. What happened to the forecast of nice weather for 5 days? Fortunately the light rain stopped soon and the skies began to clear.
After a break on top of Bemis Mtn., we headed down the mountain toward the shelter. The short ups and downs continued and we finally stumbled into the shelter area at 7pm.
Unfortunately all the tentsites were already occupied so we opted to sleep in the shelter. We quickly set up, got water and started to prepare dinner as dusk set in. That's when we came to the realization that Spider had miscounted this week's days on the trail, so we were one day short of food. Fortunately the other person in the shelter, Red, overheard our conversation and offered us an extra Top Ramen she had...Thanks Red. That takes care of dinner. Guess we will have to conserve food along the way for the other 2 meals, or hope for Trail Magic!
Finished dinner and to bed by 8:30pm...it had been a long day.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601688,"We awoke at 6:15am. The wind blew hard most the night, but calmed by the time we got up. We packed up and hit the trail at 7:30am.
Initially we did a lot of slab walking, following cairns and white blazes. Spider could still feel his pulled muscle but it was not as debilitating as yesterday. Eventually we began a 1000 ft drop. At the bottom we found some Trail Magic, but not enough to supplement our missing food. 
Next we began our big climb of the day, 1200 ft. Our lunch break was sitting on a bench next to Highway 17 looking out over a panorama of lakes (or ""ponds"" as they call them here). From there we made our way through a series of ups and downs to the Sabbath Pond Lean-to where we planned to get water. However we discovered the water source was the pond, so we went another 0.3 miles further to a stream. We hiked another 1.5 miles, for a grand total of 10, the second most of our whole hike so far. 
Every now and then we walk through electric right of ways. They're not very attractive. But when we saw a perfect size, flat, soft tent site (the first since the last lean-to), we stopped. We'd promised ourselves to start looking for a site at 7pm and that's what time it was. That is our picture for the day. 
We hiked the extra miles to try to set us up for buying some additional food in Rangely, ME tomorrow.  We have looked at the profile and mileage coming up and don't believe the current hiking plan is doable. We have 3 mountains to climb in succession, 2000 ft, 2500 ft and 1500 ft and need to average 10 miles per day. Since we are finding our energy waning by late afternoon (probably the cumulative effect of all the previous weeks of hiking)  we need to add an extra day for hiking. That means one more day of food we don't have. A re-supply run to town is the only answer.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601869,"We woke at 5:30am by alarm. We had a plan to get more food when we got to highway ME 4 and knew it would take some time, so getting out early was important. The plan had changed from hitchhiking into  the town of Rangeley, 8 miles away, to walking up the highway for 0.2 miles to a hostel.
The application Spider has on his phone (Guthook) uses GPS to pinpoint where we are on the AT, but it also points out things of interest like water sources, road crossings and hostels. Most hostels have food that they sell to guests but will also sell it to walk-ins. We would be walk-ins and hoped they had food to sell.
As we began to pack, Spider commented on the black skies. 5 minutes later it began to rain...huge drops, fast. We scurried around trying to get all important gear protected from getting wet. We finally hit the trail at 6:45am with a wet tent and wet raingear.
Within 20 feet of where we camped was a perfect moose footprint in the mud in the trail. There's a good chance a moose walked by our tent last night and we didn't know it. Still haven't seen one.
Within 10 minutes, the rain stopped and the sun eventually came out...tough weather to figure out. The day was full of short ups and downs and lots of mud and bogs. The mud can be 6-12 inches in depth and the bogs can be up to 2 feet deep. We spend lots of time figuring out how to skirt these if trail crews have not built plank walkways over them. Most don't have planks or the old planks and logs need to be replaced. One of the many bogs is the picture of the day.
When the sun came out, the heat went up and so did the humidity. Temps were almost to 90 degrees and the humidity was probably close to the same. I take back my complaining about the cold weather in previous journal entries.
One of the things we saw today that we hadn't seen since New York was sweating rocks.  The trail is covered in rock but a few are wet. It looks like they are sweating. Why? It turns out that they are large rocks with only a tip showing. Deep in the earth the rock cools. The cooled tip of the rock cools the air around it and on humid days the water condenses on the rock like it does on the outside of a glass of ice water...sweating rocks...slippery rocks.
We made it to highway ME 4 by 2:40pm and walked the 0.2 miles to the hostel, The Hiker's Hut. They welcomed us with open arms and showed us their box of food for sale. $6.50 later we had all the food we needed to extend our hike an extra day...Whew! They also offered us some watermelon to snack on. Wow, was that good. Fresh fruit and vegetables are something we miss while on the trail.
We hiked back down the road to the AT, then hiked the 1.8 miles to our destination lean-to arriving at 5:10pm. We are now in position to assault the 2000ft climb of Saddleback Mtn. tomorrow. Spider's muscle strain bothered him a little at the beginning of the day but by the end he didn't even feel it. Maybe there is something to the coach saying ""Walk it off"" when a player injures himself!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601871,"Once again we set the alarm to get up at 5:30 am. We hit the trail at 6:15am. The trail quickly began to climb. We passed by 3 ponds as we stair-stepped out way up to the base of Saddleback Mountain. It's called that because of its profile. It looks like a western saddle.
Once we passed the last pond, the climb got very steep with rock steps first then slab walking. Near the top we went above treeline. I believe was the last time for this trip. Thankfully, the howling winds from the previous night had subsided... We had light winds with overcast skies. The last part of the climb eased in steepness. We had a slab walk from one false summit to the next, for about a mile. We finally completed our 2000 ft climb and reached the top around noon.
Our info said we might see Mt. Washington  and Mt. Katahdin on a clear day. We thought we could see the distinctive outline of Mt. Washington, but it was too overcast to the north to pick out Mt. Katahdin. Best yet we had cell service. It's getting harder the further north we go. So we sent off our journal and photo for the previous day. (ET has discovered that she can amplify cell reception and get the larger photo file sent, by putting her phone in a fir tree, leaning against the trunk.) Spider also called the shuttle service to reserve a ride from Stratton to Boston on Sunday...the first step in heading home!
With cell service, Spider also checked his weather app and saw that the weather would be good for the rest of the hike except for a chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon/evening today...Hmm. As a front moves through temperatures will be dropping too, back to normal.
It was a slab walk, interspersed with mud bogs, then a 500 ft descent, followed 500 ft. ascent of Horn Mtn. (The saddle horn!). The descent off of Horn Mtn. was shades of the Whites for about 1/2 mile with vertical rocks to climb down. Then the trail turned more normal, to rocks, roots and mud. We then had a long, muddy traverse to our third peak of the day, Saddleback Junior Mtn. It was a steep climb, where we passed a trail crew working on the trail. Thanks guys! Upon reaching the top, we took today's picture with the mountains we had climbed today in the background. (We were standing on the 3rd and had climbed the 2 to the left.) It's always amazing to look back and see how far we've come in a day.
We had another Whites-like descent off of Saddleback Junior Mtn. for about 1/4 of a mile, then back to normal. During this time we heard our first rumble of thunder. Guess the forecast was right! We hustled down the trail as fast as our tired legs could carry us, arriving at the lean-to at 5:45pm. Obviously others had heard the forecast too, because the lean-to was full, so we looked around for a tent spot. Most of the good ones were already taken so we picked the next best with some roots to lie on..Oh Boy! As the rumblings got closer, we quickly set up our tent, moved our stuff inside and crawled in. 5 minutes later it started to rain...Whew! The rain lasted several hours so we cooked dinner in the vestibule of the tent and ate in the tent...a first for this hike.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602103,"The rain had stopped before we went to sleep last night and the wind came up so we thought ""Great, the wind will dry out the tent"" as we went to sleep. We were awakened at 5:15 am by rain. Darn, we got to carry a wet tent. We started getting stuff ready in the tent with intent of bringing our backpacks into the tent vestibule where we could pack them out of the rain. Fortunately the rain squall was short and by the time we were ready to pack our backpacks it had stopped,  so we packed up the regular way. We hit the the trail at 7:45am.
What the rain did was make everything slick...rocks, roots and dirt. So, ""Slow as we go"" was our motto for the day. We had a short climb, then a 1500 ft descent. The trail wasn't too steep but with everything wet we didn't push it. 
During our descent ET put her glasses in her pants pocket to protect them from the light mist/heavy fog that was falling. What she didn't know that with all the sliding down rocks she had been doing, she had worn a hole in that pocket.  When she arrived for our breakfast break, she was devastated by not only the loss of expensive glasses but now she couldn't read her phone, the maps,  her watch etc. As we ate breakfast a hiker came down the trail and said, ""Did either of you lose a pair of glasses? "" and they were ET's glasses. Thanks Shivers, you saved the day!
After the 1500 ft descent, we came to the Oberton Stream. It was flowing full from last night's rain and was 30 feet across. Spider, with his long stride, was able hop across using the rocks in the stream. You can see him waiting across the stream in today's photo. ET did not fair so well. She tried to duplicate Spider's route, but hesitated at one large step between rocks, slipped, and fell. Fortunately her butt and pack stayed on the rock, but her legs went into the water. Wet from the thighs down, she decided, ""What the heck"" and waded the rest of the way across the stream. Unfortunately she got to hike the rest of the day in wet socks and boots.
Next came a 1700 ft climb that started gradually, but steepened toward the end to the top of Lonesome Mtn. Then a rollercoaster to the Lean-to. We arrived at 3:40pm..our earliest yet! This worked out for us because this lean-to has ONE official tentsite and we got it.
After setting up the tent and getting water, we crawled into the tent to warm up. The front that moved through the previous night brought cold weather. Temperatures were in the mid-50s with a cold wind. What a difference a day makes!

It had been cold overnight.  We were both wearing extra layers over the long johns we normally wear to bed and we still got chilled. The temperature when we got up was 45 degrees with clear skies. We packed up and hit the trail at 6:50am wearing long pants and jackets. 
Our 1000 ft climb of Spaulding Mountain began immediately. It wasn't super steep but it was continuous.  Soon we began to warm up. The problem was that as soon as we stopped we would quickly get cold. As fortune would have it, our climb was up the west side of the mountain, so no sunshine for us. Usually we stop for breakfast in an hour, but that time came and went because we were still in the shadows. Finally about 8:15am we started down the other side of the mountain and found a patch of sun. We plopped down on the end of the trail and soaked up the sun Ray's as we prepared breakfast. We had to move our feet off the trail as a couple of other hikers came by...but that was okay because we had our sun!
After breakfast we made a long traverse passing by Sugarloaf Mountain with its ski gondola on top. We tried once again to get cell service, thinking it might be more available for the skiers..but no luck. It's been over 24 hours since we have had service.
We finally began our 1500 ft descent into the Caribou Valley. It started out boggy, then gently down, then steeply down, then shaded of the Whites with vertical walls that we descended backwards. The AT obviously wanted to remind us that it still had ""teeth"". Finally we reached the South Fork of the Carabassett River. All the info we had said to plan to ford it. With ET's recent experience crossing streams she was definitely putting on sandals and wading across! But when we got to the river, there was a plank crossing the river...How anti-climactic! Our picture of the day is Spider going over the river on the plank.
Across the river we began our second climb of the day...2000 ft climb of South Crocker Mth. It started out as a gentle climb but soon turned very steep and a rock scramble...the AT reminding us again?
Our plan was to look for a camping spot on top of South Crocker, but when we got there, all the twenty-somethings that had passed us in the late afternoon as we struggled up the mountain,  had taken all the tentsites. So we continued down into the saddle between North and South Crocker Mtns. and found a tentsite there...arriving at 5:30pm..
Like yesterday,  we set up the tent, then crawled inside to relax, but also to stay warm because it was starting to quickly cool down.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602108,"No alarm this morning because a short mileage day is planned. The wind came up during the night and woke us up but we were in a protected spot. However the wind made it feel colder in the tent. We finally got moving at 6:30am. Since the temperature was 51 degrees, the drill was the same as yesterday, keep on the warm clothes as long as possible before putting on the still damp hiking clothes...long pants and rain/wind jacket. We hit the trail at 7:45am.
The first order of business was to climb 500 ft. to the top of North Crocker Mtn. Then a moderate descent to a viewpoint that promised views of the Carrabassett Valley below...and, hopefully, cell service. When we got to the viewpoint, we could see Stratton, ME far below, our final destination of the day and we had 2 bars of cell service. That was enough for Spider to send the journal entries for the last 2 days, but not enough for ET to send the pictures. She gave up trying to do it via email and sent them via text messages instead. Spider also took the opportunity to call the Sratton Motel and Hostel to try to reserve a private room. Unfortunately none were available, so our last night on the trail would be in a bunk house.
From the viewpoint our descent continued, sometimes moderately steep, sometimes fairly flat, but always with rocks, roots and mud. We finally arrived at ME 27 at 2:05pm. Our hike of the AT for this year was over! 
Just before reaching the highway, we smelled something being grilled. As we got to the road there stood a guy at a portable grill motioning us to come over...Trail Magic!
So we walked over and the man's wife and daughter vacated two lawn chairs. He handed us 2 freshly grilled hot dogs. Let the celebration begin! 2 other hikers who had passed us earlier, were already there.  So the conversation immediately turned to hiking the AT. As we ate hot dogs, pastries and apples and drank soft drinks and beer, we exchanged stories. Turns out, the daughter had wanted to hike the AT with her dad, so they had tried a stretch in New York and found out it was harder than expected. They still may hike it but now they are having fun being Trail Angels.
Spider called the Stratton Motel for their shuttle and a private room had opened up...Wahoo! The shuttle arrived in about 15 minutes (after the second or third hot dog) and whisked us the 5 miles to the Stratton Motel, pictured in our photo for the day. This is where we'll return next year, for our final section of the AT.
We checked in and picked up our ""resupply"" box. Thanks for sending it Ginny! The box was full of clothes that were a little more acceptable for bussing and flying on our trip home.  First things first..a shower! Next laundry, then we relaxed awhile. Finally at 5:30pm it was time to go eat real food.
We headed across the street to a sports bar for prime rib and a stuffed burrito. Washed down with wine and beer. The celebration continued! Back to our room for reading and TV watching. Lights out at 8:30pm.
Milestones: We passed the mile marker for having hiked 2000 miles of the AT and we passed the mile marker of having hiked 250 miles on this year's hike.","Stealth camp in saddle between North and South Crocker Mtns.
","Highway ME 27/Stratton, ME","Sep 01, Sat",5.70
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602111,"We awoke at 5:45am...15 minutes before our 6am alarm went off. We organized some of our stuff then headed down the street to the Citgo gas station that also had a cafe inside. Spider had researched the best place for breakfast the day before on his way back from the laundromat. The Citgo station was the only place within walking distance.
We had a great breakfast and best of all, ET got coffee! With our change of hiking plans, she has had to do without coffee the last two days. This was not good! But this morning the ""beast"" was calmed and all was good with the world.
After breakfast we walked back to the motel and repacked our backpacks for vehicle travel from trail travel. On the trail certain items are stored outside the pack for easy access and storage, like tent parts, water filter and raingear. In vehicle travel everything is inside the pack so nothing can get caught, broken or lost...i.e. the backpack becomes a suitcase. Unfortunately that usually also means not everything will fit. So along with travel clothes in our ""resupply"" box we picked up yesterday, we also had cloth bags with handles to separately carry the overflow.
By 7:45am we were packed and waiting outside when the shuttle arrived. Seth, the motel owners son, was our shuttle driver. We had a nice 2-hour drive to Augusta, ME to the Concord Coach Lines station. It's always amazing to watch the countryside go by, looking at the trees and rocks and think ""I've been hiking through that for the last 5 weeks"".
We bought tickets to boarded the 10:15am bus headed to Boston's South Station. Easy ride on mostly freeways to Boston's South Station. There we bought tickets on the Plymouth & Brockton bus line to Cape Cod. Once on the bus, Spider gave our friends, Robert and Sherrie, a call to give them our ETA.
At 2:15 we headed to Cape Cod. Spider was disappointed when kept looking out of the window hoping to see grand views of Cape Cod, only to see the same kind of trees lining the highway that we have been walking through the last 5 weeks! We exited the bus at Barnstable, MA to find our friends standing there. It's been several years since we last saw each other so it was great to reconnect.
We piled our packs in the back of their car and headed out. In earlier communications we had agreed to do a little sightseeing that would let us stretch out our legs after almost 7 hours on the road. First we went to a boardwalk out over some marshes in Cape Cod bay. It is still the middle of Labor Day weekend so the nearby beaches had lots of people as did the boardwalk.  The water looked clear. Our hosts said it was too cold for their tastes.
Next we went to a stone tower on a high point overlooking a pond and beyond the bay. Apparently there are hundreds of these freshwater pond on the arm that forms Cape Cod bay...in fact our friends house is on a pond. Lastly we went to a ""camp"" that has been in Sherrie's family for generations. In an earlier post I talked about the term ""camp"" referred to a small summer house on a pond as it relates to our friends in Maine. The same term is used in Massachusetts.  This camp was built by Sherrie's great-grandfather as a hunting shack in the 1920s. 
Around 6pm we headed to Robert and Sherrie's house on Mill Pond. It's a great house with lots of windows and a deck overlooking the pond. Sherrie brought out the hors d'oeuvres and Robert introduced us to a local mixed drink called a ""Dark and Stormy"". We did a lot of catching up as Sherrie and Robert prepared us a wonderful meal of grilled fresh tuna, potato salad, green salad, rice, bread and zucchini soup...all washed down with a California Chardonnay. A chocolate-amaretto cheesecake finished off the meal. Our friends marveled how much food we consumed. We've got to get this Hiker Hunger under control!  
Finally, well after Hiker's Midnight, we headed off to bed...a real bed, 2 nights in a row!",,"Cape Cod, MA","Sep 02, Sun",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602348,"We awoke at 5:30am but the house seemed quite, so we hung out until 6:30am. When we ventured out we found that Sherrie and Robert had been up and in the kitchen for some time...a well insulated house! We grabbed some coffee, sat at the counter and talked as Sherrie and Robert prepared a wonderful breakfast.
After breakfast we toured the Chatham/southeastern area of the Cape Cod peninsula, the so called ""elbow"". We stopped at a museum and walked on 2 beaches, which is the picture of the day. Then a quick stop at the house for a clam chowder lunch before heading up the arm to several viewpoints and another museum.  
The last museum had a movie detailing the geologic formation of Cape Cod peninsula and bays, a result of glaciers dumping rock debris as they receded. I always assumed the peninsula was a solid rock remnant of a mountain...not so. The ocean and winds are slowly eroding the peninsula, constantly shifting beaches and waterways.  Big winter storms also have a major impact. Interesting living in a place that is very changeable even in a single generation. 
After the last museum, we headed back to Chatham to do a little shopping, then out for dinner at the Del Mar restaurant.  Good food and good conversation. 
We headed back to the house by 7:30pm. Spider and Robert did a little Whiskey/Bourbon sampling (Robert is a connoisseur of fine whiskeys) while ET and Sherrie sampled some of the cherry liqueur from their recent trip to Croatia. We finally rolled into bed at 9pm. Tomorrow we finally head home.",,View Entry,"Sep 03, Mon",0

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602347,"We awoke at 6:00am. We talked for a while then got up and took showers. We packed our packs back as ""suitcases"" to go on the plane. Finally we emerged from the bedroom just as the coffee was finishing.
We had a light breakfast then finished our packing. Robert had to take his elderly mother to the doctors, so we said good bye to him first. Then headed out with Sherrie. We drove to the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port (Some buildings with a fence around them!). Next we drove to Veterans Memorial Park. We got out of the car and walked over to the Kennedy Memorial erected by the town. Finally we headed to the Hyannis Transit Center to catch our bus to Boston's Logan Airport. We arrived at the Center at about 10am. We said our good bye to Sherrie, headed into the Center, bought our tickets and waited for our 10:30am bus. On Sherrie's recommendation we had come to the transit center rather than the place they had picked us up, Barnstable, since this is where the airport bus started its run to the airport. This way we were guaranteed a seat. Being the day after the Labor Day weekend meant people would still be on the move.
We loaded onto the bus and soon it was 2/3 full. We left a little late for the next stop, Barnstable. There the bus basically filled up...there were 2 spots left...which were filled at the next stop. Good thing we went to Hyannis. At each subsequent stop (there were 2 more) the bus driver had to tell the group waiting that the bus was full...Not a very popular announcement!
We arrived at Logan at 12:55...3 hours before our flight was scheduled to leave. We checked our packs, worked our way through security and made our way to the United Club. Since we had used points to book first/business class tickets, we had access to United's Club. We took advantage of their snacks to make a lunch and enjoyed some adult beverages. With a 1/2 hour to go we headed to our gate and boarded our plane. We love babying ourselves after a hike by flying first-class...we can stretch out tired muscles, we get good food and plenty of space to spread out.
The flight was uneventful and we landed on time in San Francisco at 7:15pm. Since we were still on East Coast time, we were pretty tired but still had to make our way home. We got our packs in baggage claim and walked to the airport BART station. We arrived at the Orinda station only to find there were no taxis available. So Spider used his Uber app and 5 minutes later we were on our way. We arrived home at 9pm...the circle was now complete!",,View Entry,"Sep 04, Tue",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602354,"As we get back into our more normal lives, we have reflected on our 250-mile experience on the AT. We both agree it was the hardest 250 miles we have experienced so far on the AT....and from what we hear from the southbounders (SOBOs), once we conquer the 15 miles of the Bigelow Mtns. there is not many challenges until we end at Mt. Katahdin. The toughness of those miles manifest itself by ET losing 10 lbs and Spider losing 19 lbs during the course of 5 weeks of hiking. That is the most we have lost on any of our section hikes of the AT...and most of them have been 6 weeks and 500 miles!
Physically, besides the weight loss, we have returned home with no major injuries. Spider finally got a blister 4 days from the end of the hike...Not sure what changed, but now he has a ""reminder"" of the hike. We were fortunate that none of our falls resulted in any injuries...except to our pride. ET won the booby prize with 12 falls to Spider's 7. Her last fall was the ""spectacular"" fall crossing Orbeton Stream 3 days from the end of our hike. We heard of others whose falls resulted in broken legs, smashed faces, etc. We hiked with, Caveman, for a while who had just got back on the trail after a month's rehab from a fall resulting in ankle damage. Our slow and careful approach seemed to have worked.
We were disappointed in the lack of animal sightings...especially not seeing a Moose! Likewise we were surprised by the lack of songbird sounds. In earlier hikes we were often awakened by the cacophony of birds singing in the morning. There was mostly silence this year. Based on discussions with others two things may be at work here: 1) we were later in the season and all mating has taken place and the fledglings have left the nest 2) the hurricane that hit last fall may have destroyed many of the bird nests and nesting areas.Spider's experiment with augmenting our pants with canvas on the butt and on the knees was fairly successful...especially for ET. She slid down rocks and climbed using her knee significantly more than Spider. Some of this had to do with ET's greater flexibility of getting up and down off the ground, some of it had to do with Spider's greater wing-span and length of step allowing him reach things ET couldn't and some of it had to do with Spider having new boots with a better grip on slanted rocks. So ET tested the pants almost daily...some days almost hourly. Today's picture is of ET's pants after 250 miles. The seams in the middle and the edges eventually gave way and had to be repaired with the universal fix-it material...Duct Tape!...but the canvass stood up well. Lots of people on the trail praised our ingenuity...So now Spider is claiming he is going to Patent it!! 
Next a few comments on this year's ""hike"". I put hike in quotes because a lot of this year's hike, much, much more than any other section, was not what I would call hiking...It was climbing. Any time I have to let go of my trekking poles and use my hands to grab onto rocks or trees to pull myself up or let myself down, I transition from hiking to climbing. Well over half of the hike included some kind of climbing...most of the section of the trail managed by the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) from Mt. Moosilauke to Grafton Notch. It feels to me that somewhere the purpose of the Appalachian Trail being a hiking trail has been lost in this section. As detailed in my various journal entries, many of the places north of Grafton Notch, i.e. not managed by the AMC, where the trail got vertical, trail maintainers put in stone steps, created switchbacks or, as a last resort, put in wooden or metal steps. Somehow the AMC section of the AT has focused on running (and charging money for) Huts, Shelters and Campsites, instead of creating a hiking trail...and apparently the the Appalachian Trail Conservancy supports this. Most thru-hikers have very little money, so are not particularly pleased about the AMC section of the AT. We heard many angry words from them and concerns about why the toughest section was also the place you had to pay to sleep....conspiracy theory!!
Okay, I'm getting down off my soapbox....Finishing this section was satisfying. We were praised by many that two ""elderly"" people could tackle this section and survive...especially ET. We hiked on and off with 2 other women in their 60's and ET was the only one to make it through.
Next year the plan is finish the last 188 miles to Mt. Katahdin. After that it will be B&B to B&B hiking!",,View Entry,"Sep 06, Thu",0
