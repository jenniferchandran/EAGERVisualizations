Sandy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582627,"As my March 4th start date approaches I am getting more and more excited. I had my pack shakedown at REI last weekend and feel like I am all set for gear. Changed out my sleeping bag. I had only used my mummy bag in warmer conditions and tend to be pretty warm when I sleep so had never actually had everything all zipped up. Tested in the 20's and realized I was going to have issues with feeling too confined. New bag is roomier and has a sleeve for the sleeping pad which cuts down on the noise which is great. Started training my replacement at work this week. I am fortunate to have been granted a 6 month leave so I can pursue this adventure. Starting to lock down the last few details, this journal being one of them.","

Sandy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583075,Slept in the tent on the deck again last night. Wanted to test the new sleeping bag. Much better as far as size - can move around more than I could in the mummy bag. Was not as warm but put more clothes on and was fine. Practiced hanging a bear bag yesterday. I was not horrible at it but can see why people have trouble. I've been watching videos hikers have posted who have already started for this year. Seems like it's been pretty wet. Great to see everyone so excited in spite of the weather. Still tweaking some items in my pack. I imagine that will be going on for a while. Counting down the days.,,View Entry,"Feb 19, Mon",0
Sandy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583412,"I am 3 days away from my departure date and things are just about set. I'm sure I will pack and unpack a few more times but my gear is pretty much set. Tomorrow is my last day at work and most of my goodbyes have been said. I am so thankful for all the the kind words, concern, prayers and good wishes that I have received. I feel so fortunate to have this opportunity and for the many people that have supported me even if they thought I was crazy. A special thanks to my husband who never batted an eye when I brought this up to him a little over a year ago.I've had numerous people ask me what inspired this attempt. A couple of years ago I read the book Wild by Cheryl Strayed and was amazed at her journey and the physical and mental strength it required. I sought out more books about the PCT and then the AT and devoured as much information as I could find. I spent hours on YouTube following Dixie and Happy Feet and anyone else I could find. I wanted to be a part of that thru hiker experience, to face the mental and physical challenge and come though transformed on the other side. Why not me? And so I started making plans, accumulating gear, slowly telling people, applied for a leave from work and it all fell into place. And here I am just days from beginning my journey and I am so excited it's hard to sleep.Thank you to my friends and family. I will do my best to keep you posted on this adventure. I can't express how much I appreciate all of your support.Sandy",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Tue",0
Sandy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583630,"I have survived my first day on the Appalachian Trail! I journal about 5 pages of notes when I got to camp but will try to condense.  I woke up nervous and cranky after a decent nights sleep at a hotel about an hour and a half away. I kept thinking Reuben probably can't wait to get rid of me. Started to feel better once we wet son the road. We parked in the Springer Mountain parking area which is about a mile from the start of the trail which means you have to walk a mile back to the start and then come back trough the parking area. Reuben walked the first 2 miles out and back and we were both so glad he did. It calmed both of us. We said our goodbyes in the parking area and I was off. It could not have been a more perfect day weather wise. It was sunny and cool. The first 3 miles or so were so beautiful. Rhododen tunnels, babbling streams with footbridges, the terrain was soft with pine needles and dirt that felt good and smelled great. The last couple of miles were a steady climb - some sections more taxing than others. I caught myself breathing hard and realized I had all day to get to my destination. I slowed down, took smaller steps and adopted a more comfortable pace. I was at Hawk mountain campsite in about 3 hours from when I left the parking lot arriving at around 1:45 which gave me plenty of time to  set up camp, relax, write, eat and talk to people. Everyone has been very nice. I feel great although I'm sure I'll be a little sore. Can't seem to get a text out but was able to wander away from the campsite with my phone in the air till I found  2 bars so I could check in with Reuben and let him know I was ok. It's 7:15 and I am all tucked in for the night. It was a perfect first day. I hiked alone and caught myself smiling to myself multiple times. Feeling her fortunate to be out here. I'm sure I won't always be this wordy, but feeling pretty overwhelmed with my first day and wanted to share. Sandy","Springer Mountain

Let's start with how my first night went. I slept OK. had a little trouble regulating my my body heat. Inside the bag was too warm. Outside my bag was freezing.  Was not scared bit did wake up to some crazy sounds a couple of times. It started off with an owl which was followed by something like a pack of wild dogs or coyotes. I don't even know if there are coyotes in Georgia. Someone said it was owls either hunting or it's mating season. Mrs. Contable's class look that up for me. My knees, hips and ankles were talking to me till about 2 a.m. I couldn't find the ibuprofen and thought I must have put it in the bear box with my food. It was in my backpack - I'm better organized today. Everything felt good today with the exception of one little blister on my pinky toe which is now wrapped. Another great hiking day. Everyone made me worry about Mount Sassafrass but it was my as bad as I expected. Hard but doable. Had 4g service at the top so could push out my blog post and a few texts. Made my first stream crossing where I had to take off my shoes. Trying to keep the feet dry. Still not a much of an appetite but I'm snacking and drinking plenty of fluids. Lots of people at the shelter tonight since its supposed to rain. (Raining as I write this) not sure how you pack up without everything getting soaked. So far have met people from Massachusetts, Georgia, Hawaii, Ohio, Florida, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and either Denmark or Germany (conflicting info) and I'm sure others I'm forgetting. Everyone has been great. Thank you to those who are commenting.","Hawk Mountai Campsite

Great nights sleep. I slept from about 7:30 till 5:00 am. Only woke up when the automatic machine gun fire started which was a little freaky. Luckily I was warned earlier in the day that we are in a military training area and we might hear some exercises. Someone said they can be lying by the trail in camouflage and we're not suppose to talk to them if we see them. It rained off and on all night and I had to pack up in the rain. That was a new experience. Didn't get out of camp till about 9 and hiked in the rain until about 1:30 when it cleared up. It wasn't awful but I did get wet and I'm sure my shoes are going to be squishy tomorrow. Had plenty of time to let my feet dry out at camp. Got to the Lance Creek campsites around 3. Set up on the last available pad with 4 other people. Sun came out so we could dry all of our stuff. Had my first trail magic today. Troy was waiting in the pouring rain in his pick-up with fried chicken,  pizza, Sprite, beer, and Twix candy bars. He's from above Atlanta and works construction so was off. Thought it would be a good day to feed some soggy hikers and he was right. I haven't eaten much but enjoyed some warm pepperoni pizza, Sprite and a Twix. Appetite might be picking up since I ate an entire Knorr rice pilaf side at camp tonight. The cozy I made works well. Thank you to Dixie who hiked in 2015 for that tip. There is no privy at these campsites so I had my first experience in the woods. Honestly - it was the least gross place I've gone up to this point and the view was spectacular. Did a little doctoring on my pinky toe and wrapped up for the night. 7:30 seems to be th magic hour. Heading to Neel gap tomorrow and avoiding the small section of the trail where you need a bear canister. Another successful day on the trail. Right hip was,a little touchy if I needed to take a high step but otherwise body feels good. Need to stretch more I think. Next couple of days look good weather wise.","Goo h Mountain Sheltet

Slept well again. Up between 6 or 7 and out of camp around 8:25. Stopped about 1/2 Mile in and ate breakfast sitting on a rock with the most amazing view. Not a bad hiking day. Hiked over Blood Mountain which I didn't realize was happening today. The view from the top was spectacular and the privy was the least gross I've seen yet. I don't think many people stay in that shelter since you need a bear canister in that area. The shelter was cool looking - stone with 2 rooms. The way down was a little taxing. Lots of rock scrambling. Made it to Neels Gap 2ish.The store was so warm and had decent food choices and all kinds of hiking gear. They will also cook pizza for you. Opted to stay in the bunkhouse. For $20 you get a bunk, shower and clean towel. There is a common room where everyone hangs out and talks. Several of the guys I've been hiking around for days are staying here. I've eaten pizza, Cheetos, cheese. A trail angel showed up with sandwiches, fruit and sodas so I felt like i should eat again and now I feel like I could pass out. Brian said he saw bear tracks today but of course I missed them. You spend the day looking at your feet. There are rocks and roots everywhere and it's the last way you want to end your hike. I can easily see how people could get off track, but most of the time there is only one path. The next couple of days are supposed to be cold like today. I had to wear my coat, hat and gloves. Plan on pushing the next 3 days so that I can make it into Hiawassi on Sunday. Calling for rain/ thunderstorms. Feel like a new woman with food and a shower. I'll be in bed early. ","Lance Creek campsites

So surprisingly I slept worse in the bunkhouse than in my tent. Not because people were snoring or otherwise disturbing me, just couldn't seem to get comfortable. You had to wait until the majority of the people were ready to get up to start moving since there was one light for the room. I was the lone woman and everyone was great. We sat around talking in the common area for awhile it was nice, but almost made me a little homesick. Was up and out around 8 and headed for Low Gap Shelter which was my longest day so far 11.5 miles. Now for those of you who are going to call me out for going more than 10 miles in the first week it was the shower. I stopped 1.1 miles short for a shower and it was worth it. Hiked in my coat, hat and gloves all day, it was a little chilly and only got worse. Hiked over Levelland, Cowrock, Wildcat and Poor Mountains today. None were too bad but there were a couple of good climbs. It's like interval training for hours. Trail magic in one of the gaps - cookie and a muffin. A man topped off my water there as well. People are so kind. The cookie fell on the ground and i totally picked it up and ate it. Got to the shelter and all of the sites were practically under the bear cables which seems odd so I opted to sleep in the shelter for the first time. There were only four of us in there and it was freezing. Cooked something hot to eat and was layered up and in my sleeping bag by 5:30. I was shivering so hard my jaw hurt but once i was tucked in I was able to take off some layers and slept well. Did not write at all since if I took my gloves off I couldn't feel my fingers.","Neels Gap

Surprisingly enough I was probably asleep by 10:00 and slept till 6 even with the cold and wind last night. Did not want to get out of the sleeping bag. My water froze in my water bottles. My biggest fear of mice running over my head did not happen although I did warn the guys if it did they were going to hear me. Probably not a scream but definitely a reaction. I was up and out quickly since it was so cold. Didn't feel warm until I actually got moving. Headed to Blue Mountain Shelter 7.3 miles away. Short day but was exhausted even though there weren't many significant climbs. Think the long day yesterday took more out of me than I thought.  Made plans to shuttle out of Unicoi Gap tomorrow to avoid the incoming rain. Supposed to start tomorrow by noon and rain into Sunday. I will be at the Hampton Inn in Helen for 2 nights and eating like a queen. Fellow hiker Salty Dog took care of my reservation and the shuttle - so grateful! Time to let my body have a little recovery time. This has been a big change from sitting behind a desk. I'm sure I'm not eating enough but I'm definitely eating more than the first few days. Spent time this afternoon warm in my tent typing out my blogs and catching up with people. Salty Dog, Duck, Wheezy and I have just been yelling between our tents to socialize. Looking forward to a little time off!","Low Gap Shelter

Today was a nero for me. Pretty much everyone staying at Blue Mountain Shelter had plans to hike the 2.4 miles to Unicoi Gap in the morning and head to town to get out of the rain that was coming our way. Everyone congregated in the parking lot waiting for their shuttles and there was lot of conversation about what everyone was going to eat. Salty Dog and I headed to the Hampton Inn in Helen for some R&R. Helen is a little tourist town meant to look like a German village. When i got into my room the fire alarm was chirping and I was afraid to unload anything in case I had to change rooms. Maintenance was here within minutes and took care of the problem. Service here has been great. After I showered and then soaked for about 45 min. I headed into town looking for some cheap clothes so I didn't need to wear my hiking clothes the whole time I was here. I may keep everything but the pants. They are way too heavy. Headed across town to pick up a $1 rain poncho and a few other supplies. Toe was looking a little sketchy but was better after a soak. The rest will hopefully give it a chance to heal. Met Salty Dog later for dinner and had my first real food in a week. Tasted great but my stomach was not so sure. Spent the evening relaxing in my room and making a few phone calls. ","Blue Mountain Shelter

Sandy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583961,"Today was a zero day in Helen and was pretty uneventful. I took a walk  back to the Dollar General for the final things I needed to resupply. My toe is healing. Put my shoe on for the first time in days without it hurting. Glad I took the day to rest and recover because I'm not sure it would have had I stayed out there in the rain. It's hard to keep things clean. Stopped on the way back and had some pork barbeque, fries, cole slaw and a soda and stopped when I was full unlike I did for my first real dinner which made me miserable. Learned my lesson. Had the place to myself, sitting in front of a nice warm fireplace with a little rock music wafting in from the kitchen. It was perfect. Febreezed everything I couldn't wash and organized all my gear. Mapped out the week ahead and reserved a bunk at Top of Georgia Hostel for Tuesday night. It's supposed to be cold the first couple of nights. Should be in Franklin on Saturday. Watching a movie now and then hoping for a good night's sleep. I find these down times almost harder than hiking days. If I'm going to feel homesick it's during these times. You're too busy or exhausted on the trail to think much about home. I have been assured this is perfectly normal. The rain and cold don't help. All is good and looking forward to being out there and for some warmer temps and sun by the end of the week.","Helen, Georgia

Sandy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584322,Short day out of Helen. Our shuttle driver was late so we didn't leave until after 10:00. Although it was a short day it was difficult. Thought that after the rest my legs would be fresh and I would fly over those miles. I neglected to factor in that there were two major climbs of about 1000 feet that seemed to go on forever. Knew that it was supposed to be cold the next couple of nights so made reservations at Top of Georgia Hostel for tomorrow. Got into camp close to 4:00 and immediate set up so I could get out of the cold and wind. The campsite sat at the top of the ridge with and the wind roared all night. I used my gossamer gear pad to help create an extra block on the windward side of the tent and awoke to frost everywhere - inside and outside the tent.,"Helen, Georgia

Sandy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584325,"Packed up quickly in the morning and moved out knowing it was going to be a longer day and looking forward to sleeping at the hostel. I had read good things about it in a lot of the hiker journals. One solid climb towards the end of the day. It was cold and everything was frosty. Forgot to mention in yesterday's entry that I noticed when I was hiking that the top of the mountains were frosted over. Eventually when I reached that elevation it was beautiful - everything was white, covered with a thin layer of frost. Then the wind picked up and with each gust the frost broke from the trees and pelted you with pieces of ice - some big, some small. Thought it was interesting how quickly my perception of that frost changed. Leap frogged with the same couple of guys on the trail all day. Although when you looked in the guide it didn't appear to be too difficult of a day it was deceiving. There was one solid climb towards the end that sucked the life out of you. On the way down into Dick's Creek Gap I passed a woman with a dog going the other directions. The dog seemed very excited to see me - was not on a leash but was OK. As I got to the end I hear a dog barking and here it was the same dog running after me, but this time I wasn't sure how it felt. She kept calling him back but he would turn around as soon as I started to move. Eventually she got him on a leash and I continued on my way a little annoyed. When I came out to the road crossing I need to turn left and head down the road 1/2 mile to get to the hostel. Just as I started down the road I heard someone yelling asking me if I needed a ride - it was the girl with the dog and another friend she must have been walking to meet on the trail. Once again, how quickly perceptions change. We loaded my pack in the back and she had a bag of snacks in the car that she shared - Veggie Straws never tasted so good. Drove the half mile to the hostel where I was greeted by a full staff of people offering hot and cold drinks, food, a towel, scrubs to wear while they did my laundry. They have quite an efficient operation there. You sign an agreement to not use drugs or drink alcohol on the premises. There was a common room with a TV, computer, tables where you could eat multiple guitars to play. On the other side of the building were the bunk rooms. The one I was in had 3 rooms with multiple bunks, a bathroom and a small kitchen area. Felt good after a shower and some food.This is going to come as a surprise, but I was well aware that it would be my last day on the trail. See my conclusion for the details. ","Tray Mountain Shelter

Sandy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584329,"I headed home the day after my stay at Top of Georgia Hostel. I am fine - no major injuries. On Day 4 I had my first inkling that I was not feeling OK. I started to feel overwhelmingly sad and with each day it got worse. For those of you that know me - that is not who I am. I consider myself to be pretty positive. I may get angry, irritated or upset on occasion but I am not one to wallow in negative feelings. I wouldn't have said I was homesick or that it was because I missed Reuben or my family and friends. I didn't feel like it was because things were hard or uncomfortable. I really couldn't put my finger on the cause but it was like a weight that with each day got heavier and heavier. I consider myself to be pretty self-aware and knew that I did not want to continue on feeling this way. I made the decision that rather than push on and use up all my vacation and resources on something that was not bringing me joy I would call it a day. I spoke at length with several people about my decision. The night at the hostel I spoke with a section hiker named HOBO (Hiking One's Boots Off). In the morning as we were all packing up to go he said he had spent a lot of time thinking about me after our conversation and asked if I had a trail name. He had thought of two, but it was the second one that hit home. Endeavor. He said you are not afraid to step out and try new things. You will endeavor to try, to continue to learn. I thought it was perfect. I tend to do things in a big way - in this case it happened to be very public which carries a little more risk. Please do not be afraid to ask me about my 10 day adventure on the Appalachian Trail. It was an incredible experience - I met some really interesting people and challenged myself physically and mentally. It just wasn't for me long term and I am totally OK with that. I would have much more regret if I hadn't tried at all. Thank you to everyone who has supported me in this journey. Please don't be disappointed - I'm not. I'm looking forward to providing a little trail magic for my trail friends when they hit Pennsylvania. ",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Sat",0
