Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584521,"I wanted to test my ability to hike a long distance with a 40 pound pack. My nephew agreed to come with me on a test hike. We decided to do the good water loop near Austin Texas. It Is a 26 mile loop, and our intentions were to do 13 miles on Saturday, and 13 miles on Sunday completing  the loop that afternoon. 
 The hike was uneventful for the first eight or 9 miles, and then I developed a huge blister on the ball of my left foot. We camped out after hiking 14 1/2 miles on Saturday. The next day, it was very painful to walk for me. We hiked 4.5 miles to a road, and got a ride from Lyft! I didn’t complete the 26 miles,  but I learned a great lesson. Don’t push myself too far too fast. I plan on only going six or 7 miles for the first several days if not weeks of the Appalachian Trail!",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Mon",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584486,"when I was younger, I always wanted to hike. The first time I ever went on a hike of any distance with my father and older sister. We went to the top of chimney tops in the smoky mountains. I thought it was the hardest hike I had ever done in my life! It seemed like it took all day, later when I went when I was older, it really only took about 2 1/2 hours to go to the top and come back down to the bottom.  I don’t know what it was, but I loved that challenge of getting to the top.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Sat",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584487,"when I was around 11 years old, we went to the Grand Canyon for family vacation. We were in a camper. My father took me to an outfitter, and we were looking at backpacks, sleeping bags, and stoves and cooking utensils. I was pretty excited! I thought we were going to hike down into the canyon, spend the night and come back out the next day! Well, I guess he looked at all the equipment and thought it cost too much, because we left the store  empty-handed . We went back to the camper, he barbecued and we had a great time anyway, but I  always wanted to hike somewhere big!",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sun",0

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584555,"well, I am finally on the way. I left about 9 AM this morning after buying some community coffee for my buddy in Roanoke Virginia.  He will be hiking with me for a few days when I begin. I made it to Nashville, and went to the REI store there to get my pack fitted. The sales people there are so friendly, especially Bill who help me with my pack. He recommended an extra large shoulder harness, but they didn’t have one in stock. I spent the night in Lebanon Tennessee, with plans to stop at the REI store in Knoxville to see if they have a harness for me.",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Mon",0

The extra large harness was much more comfortable than the large. Thanks to Sarah at REI for all of her help. She was great! I headed into Virginia,  and noticed that the trail crossed interstate 81, the interstate that I was on. I stopped and found it, and took a picture. I will include it here. I’m spending the night in Christiansburg, and there is snow predicted overnight. Pictures to follow.",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Tue",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584647,"There are anywhere from 8 to 10 inches of snow in the area today, I thought it would not be a good day for me to start my new hike. I did travel to the trail and took a few pictures of what it’s like. Snow is pretty deep, but some people are still going to Mcafee’s knob. We will start tomorrow!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Wed",0
Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584819,"we got a somewhat late start, and didn’t get on the trail until about 1:15 PM. The trail was moderat to easy for the first 2 miles or so. We crossed our first hiker, trail name Crockett. He started in Pennsylvania and is going down to Springer Mountain. Good luck Crockett! The temperature was in the mid 40s with the sun shining. There was about 6 to 8 inches of snow on the ground, but the trail was pretty  clear. We stopped at one of the shelters along the way just to take a break. There we met Kyle, who was a section hiker, and three other hikers from Michigan. Also section hikers. We rested for a while and filled up our water bottles. Thanks to the crew from Michigan for filtering our water for us! We ate a snack and got back on the trail. So far I was surprised at how easy it was. I was about to change my mind. 
 For the next two hours or so, I don’t think we took a step on level ground  or downhill. It was all uphill. I’m not sure how many feet it was, but it was very difficult. We finally got to the top of McAfee‘s knob, and the views were fantastic. Everything was covered with snow, huge icicles hanging off of the knob! We took a few pictures, and the wind started to pick up. We started to make our way down to Campbell’s shelter.  Here, it was all downhill, but the trail was covered with snow.  Sometimes over a foot deep. One other person had broken the trail for us, but it had iced back over. It was very difficult walking, and sometimes difficult to tell where the trail was. Looking for white blazes in a white, winter wonderland can be very difficult. There was snow on the ground, the snow was stuck to the trees, it was stuck to every branch. It took us another hour to get to Campbell shelter. By the time we got there, there was very little sunshine left, and we were on the eastern side of the ridge  so starting to get dark. Unexpectedly, the wind started to pick up, and blew exceedingly hard. The temperature began to drop. We started a fire, but soon realized it was too cold and too windy to sit around.  We figured we were the only two crazy enough to be out in this weather, and we were the only two at the shelter, so we decided to pitch our tent inside the shelter. We thought it would be wise to try to block some of the wind so that we could sleep in some sort of comfort. My friend’s tent was not free standing, so we had some bungee cords and  tied it to the center post of shelter and the wall. The only problem was, the face of it could not be zipped shut. Mine was free standing so I could close it off. We made a quick hot supper, he had miso soup, I had mashed potatoes. And we crawled in bed for the night. We had as much clothes as we could comfortably put on, as well as hats scarves and had our coats covering  our feet. It was a little chilly at first, but it seemed like it was going to be fairly comfortable. I woke up at 5 AM or so, with my feet cold, and the rest of my body getting a little chilled. It’s a bad feeling when you’re cold, and there are no more clothes to put on, no blanket to cover with, and you can’t turn up the heat! I knew with our tents facing east, that when the sun came up, it would heat up our tents. But that was going to be another hour and a half to two hours.  I fell asleep somewhere around 7 AM I think. I woke up at 9 o’clock and I was very warm and very comfortable. The sun was out, and it heated up my tent. It felt great! We had made it through the night!","Va 311 intersection with Appalachian Trail

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584837,"Today, it was going to be sunshine, but the temperature would dip down into the low 20s overnight down in the valley. I’m pretty sure it was going to be colder than that up in the mountains where we were. I estimated, that we slept through about 25° weather last night, and it was gonna be about 7° colder tonight. If we made it through that, we had a 10 mile trudge through unbroken snow down to Daleville. I thought we might be in trouble if we went and attempted that, I didn’t want to be caught in a winter storm. Because there’s another one coming  Saturday. 
 When I went to get water for morning coffee, I crossed a fire Road. I looked it up in my Guthook app, and realized this fire Road could take us back to the parking lot where our car was. We both calculated the amount of cold weather that was coming, plus the extra snow on the way on Saturday, and realized our best bet was to backtrack to our car. 
 We packed up our gear and by 10 AM were on the fire Road headed back to the car. The hike was very easy, and it was still a three hour hike out.  I hated to leave, but I think it’s the best thing for us. We will try again later, after the weather starts to cooperate.

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585014,"today I did a day hike, starting at a creek on Virginia route 620. The highlight of the day was to be the summit of the Dragon’s tooth. The day started off chilly, with the temperature right around freezing. The first 2 to 3 miles were relatively easy, with moderate to difficult ascents, and very little downhill. 
 I thought going to be a very easy day. As has happened before, the trail showed me otherwise. 
 The higher I got, the more snow was on the trail. At times, I was crunching through 4 to 6 inches of snow on the trail, and 12 to 14 inches of snow on the side, where my trekking poles were being stabbed, to try to keep my balance. 
 I got to the top in about 3 1/2 to 4 hours, which really wasn’t bad. It had been extended due to the snow, and the trail not being marked very well. I sat down and had lunch, and looked at my Guthook app. It showed that everything was downhill from here! I was very excited because it would be an easy descent down to my car. Boy was I in for a surprise! 
 The downhill immediately turned into a mountaineering adventure versus a hike. Downhill was extremely steep, and full of huge boulders. I slid down on my butt, went down on all fours, anything to get down from the Dragon’s tooth. This went on for probably an hour and a half until the trail got somewhat easier. 
 For the next two hours or so, I went downhill, and, got lost. I ended up going backwards  on the trail for a short while then turned around when I recognized boulders. I also fell, and when I did, my pole hit me in the forehead knocking my cap off into the weeds. It was a very event full day! I was glad to finally get down the mountain. It took me eight hours to go the 8 miles that I went.  As a sidenote, my Apple phone was with me. In the health app, it states I climbed 114 flights of stairs! Unbelievable!","VA 620

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585390,"today, I restarted my thru hike. Since my friends and I had to leave Campbell shelter a week ago due to poor weather conditions, I hiked back on the fire Road, and stayed in the shelter there. I got no mileage credit for this 4.5 miles. While waiting there, I met a young hiker named Sour patch from Florida.  She’s a really tough young woman. She has already hiked over 700 miles from Springer Mountain and through 4 or 5 snowstorms. She was hiking in shoes that were so worn out, her feet were coming out of them. She said she was going to get new shoes in Roanoke the next day. Good luck to her!  Tomorrow, I’m hiking 6 miles.","VA 311

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585395,"I left Campbell shelter at about 8:15 AM. It rained overnight, it was rather chilly. Probably in the upper 40s. There was rain coming out of the west, and I hoped it would miss me.  It didn’t miss me completely, but it was very light for a very short period time. No problem at all. It started downhill for quite some ways, and then it was all uphill for at least a couple of hours. Very steep! I labored quite a bit to get up there, but I think I was at Tinker Cliffs somewhere around 1:00 PM. The Cliffs are beautiful! They go on for about a quarter-mile, and it’s just one stunning view after another. It was pretty windy and pretty chilly up there. I think a front was coming through. A cold front. I went downhill for about a mile and a half to the Lambert meadow shelter. When I first got there, it was very quiet.  Pretty soon, lots of people started showing up. There were lots of day hikers, section hikers, as well as kids that were off for Easter break from school. I met one extraordinary man that says he is a section hiker, but he’s going from Damascus Virginia to Maine! That’s one hell of a section! He’s putting in about 17 miles a day! His trail name is gentleman. Good luck! I know you’ll make it!  I went to bed really early, as it was getting pretty cold. I think I was in bed by 730 or so.","Campbell shelter

The wind blew off and on all night long, and I think it was somewhere in the mid to upper 20s. I don’t think my sleeping bag is built for that even though he claims to be a 20° sleeping bag! I was very cold, especially my feet. No matter what I did, I couldn’t warm-up! Finally when daylight came, me and Gentlemen got up, and started packing our things. I put a couple of those chemical warmers in my boots.   Got my feet warm fairly quickly. I was glad to have them! I also lit my hand warmer and it helped considerably! My fingers get so cold packing everything up, and you can’t do it with gloves or mittens on.  I was on the trail about 8:15 AM. I was hiking 9.3 miles into Daleville ! My longest day yet! It started off fine, with moderate to strenuous uphills and downhills. This went on for most of the day. By the time I got to around mile six or seven, my feet were in tremendous pain! No blisters, just pain!    When I got to Daleville, I called my wife, and she said I would feel better in the morning! We’ll see! Somewhere in the middle of my hike, I got passed by a very nice young man named Walkie-Talkie. He puts in about 26 miles a day! I don’t know how they do it but they do! I also got passed by the famous Opa. He’s older than I am, but puts in somewhere around that same mileage. Anywhere between 20 to 30 miles in a day! Unbelievable!  Good luck to you two guys! Seems like you are both a sure bet to make it to Maine!  I got a room at the Howard Johnson. It’s about what I expected. For the price, it’s a great room. I don’t have any problem with it and the guy that checked me in was very nice. I’m washing my clothes and I just got through eating a big pizza! I’ll probably be asleep by 9 o’clock.

I stopped and bought a few energy bars at the local convenience store. Snickers and Reese’s Fastbreak. The trail was moderately difficult, as most of it was uphill. We crossed several streams, streets, and a set of railroad tracks. The trail also meandered over and through several meadows. It was a  4 1/2 hour hike for me to get to the shelter. It was a very nice clean shelter with a cistern system in the back. When I arrived, there was already a through hiker there. Her name is Buckey. She just started her hike in Daleville, and is doing a flip flop , As am I.  Within an hour or so, several other through hikers arrive. Ghost, Sour patch, Mainer , T5000, and Captain Blackbeard. All of these  tough individuals have already hiked over 700 miles through several snowstorms. An unbelievable bunch!  After cooking supper, I set up my tent and settled in for the night.

My bag is rated to 20°, but I think 40 is about as low as I can sleep comfortably. I got up, made breakfast, packed up everything and got on the trail relatively early. 830 or so.  It was a fairly uneventful day  except for the fact that I unknowingly lost my coat. I got hot, and so shoved it under one of the straps on the side of my pack. Apparently it got snagged in a branch and got pulled out. A through hiker, Time Zone, let me know as he passed me, that Buckey picked up my coat and will be bringing it to the shelter tonight. I’m thankful she saw it!  I’m unable to upload any pictures, because they are all over 5 MB, which is the limit. I arrived at the shelter, , And there were two section hikers as well as time zone already at the shelter. Buckey showed up about an hour later. I pitched my tent, because I snore so badly!

I got up, cooked breakfast, packed up my tent and was on the way. The day warmed up nicely, and proved to be a moderately difficult day. Lots of up-and-down‘s. About midway through the day I  started crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway. A fog rolled in, with tremendous wind gusts. It got very cold! I stopped and put on my overcoat, as well as my mittens and wool hat. This lasted for about an hour or two, and then the fog lifted, the sun came out it was a great afternoon! The trail  was moderately challenging, and the distance was plenty far enough for this old man. When I got to the shelter, there were two through hikers already there. Both of them going southbound. Turtle, and Control Z. We were later joined by Bullfrog,  and Buckey.  Bullfrog is  another of those amazing hikers that have already gone over 700 miles, through multiple snowstorms, and keep going! Tough beyond my comprehension! The shelter is carved into the side of the mountain, and doesn’t have much level space around it. I found a tent space about 50 feet below the shelyet, and set up there. I cooked supper, and went to bed. The forecast called for overnight rain, and gusty wind the next day.","Wilson Creek Shelter

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585801,"The temperature remained in the mid 40s or so. I had my best night of sleep yet. It rained off and on overnight, and when daylight came, it was still raining. I stayed in my tent and dozed off and on until around 830 or nine. I got up, made some coffee, and Buckey joined me for breakfast. All the other hikers were already gone. We weren’t concerned with leaving early, as we only had a 3.1 mile hike to Highway 43. There, my friend would pick us both up at five in the afternoon. Buckey was going to be staying in Daleville at the Howard Johnson‘s again, and I was going to stay at his home in Roanoke. Both of us will be taking a 0 mile day on Thursday, hitting the trail again on Friday.  While I was preparing breakfast, Buckey was taking all of her gear out of her tent and putting it in the shelter.  I was kind of walking around and eating my oatmeal. I noticed a dry spot in the leaves where her tent was. I thought, wow, she’s really packing her stuff up fast she’s already got her tent packed . I asked her, “you’ve already packed up your tent”? She said “no, it’s still there”.  I went around the corner, and saw the dry spot but no tent! “No it’s not I said”!  She came running around the corner and we both looked at an empty spot  where her tent used to be. The wind was so hard, it had picked up her tent like a Walmart plastic bag and tossed it out into the woods. We went and retrieved it and dumped all the leaves out of it so she could pack it away.  I left the trail at about noon, with Buckey just a few minutes ahead of me. The day was cool to start, And change very quickly. The winds started roaring through add an estimated 40 mph. The sun came out, and the temperature dropped throughout the day. We crisscrossed the Blue Ridge Parkway again today, and when we got out onto the highway, to the overlooks, the wind was blowing at Gail force. It was so hard, it would actually blow me off the trail, and push my  poles sideways so that I could not stick them in the ground. Once I started heading down hill toward the highway, I was protected from the wind, and it warmed up nicely and was a beautiful afternoon. 
 I arrived at the Highway at 2 o’clock, with three hours to kill. I took out my miniature iPad, and watched some Olympics videos. Buckey showed up about an hour and a half later, she had gotten lost for a short while. We sat on the side of the trail, about 50 yards from the highway. I didn’t want to sit on the side of the highway, as I thought people would stop and want to give me a ride. Roanoke is about 25 to 30 miles away, and I didn’t think anyone would want to bring me all the way into the city. I texted my friend, and he told me he would text me when he left work to pick us up. 
 At about 5 o’clock, I saw of car which looked just like mine, even had the trailer hitch and the wiring harness hanging below it! It’s sped right by us. I mentioned to Buckey,”hey I think that’s my car”! I texted  my friend, and sure enough, he had just passed by us. About five minutes later he was coming back in the other direction and stopped and picked us up. We dropped Buckey off at the Howard Johnson’s, and I came to his house, for a good nights sleep and some good food!","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586182,"our shuttle driver/Trail guide, Homer Witcher, picked us up at 7:30 AM.  Homer, his wife, and two children, through hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2002. There were a couple of inches of snow overnight in the higher elevations. The blue ridge parkway was shut down, so Homer found a back way to get us to our starting point. At his suggestion, we went South, because that would be much less uphill and it would be faster. Thanks Homer! You saved us a lot of uphill effort! 
 When we arrived, the temperature was 26°, and a couple of inches of snow was on the trail. It was quite cold for the first two or three hours. Today I decided to try my tennis shoes instead of my hiking boots. I thought my boots may be hurting my feet. It didn’t take long to realize that the  tennis shoes are no match for snow. My feet started to get a little wet, and a lot cold. 
 Somewhere in the first hour or two, I came to Black Rock overlook. It is probably the most beautiful site I have seen yet on the trail. It has expansive views, and everything was covered in snow. Absolutely gorgeous. This picture does not do it justice. 
 The snow began to fade around mid day, with the hiking being fairly easy. One of the highlights of the day was a beautiful two-story shelter. It had a loft, that would support sleeping for several hikers, as well as the main floor. It also had an expansive porch, as well as bench, and shelf. Things you don’t find very often. Also, the creek ran within about 10 feet  of the front, which made water very easy to get, something hikers always need.  The last 3 miles or so of my hike were pretty painful. I’ve got some foot pain, as well as left knee pain. Looks like for now, about 8 miles is the best I can do before it gets too painful. I’m afraid the last mile or so of downhill, I looked like someone with polio and arm brace crutches hobbling down the mountain. I’m glad that  there was no one there to see me!","Fire road 812

I had all my warm weather gear on and began hiking up Apple Orchard mountain . At the top, there are beautiful views. There is a weather station, or radar installation on top of the mountain. Also, I got to go through the guillotine. This is a rock formation that has a boulder on each side, holding up  a boulder that could possibly fall on your head! Not really though. The day went very well, and this is one of the longer mileage days that I have had with a full pack on. I passed one shelter, and the next  shelter was too far, so I camped at marble spring.  There was good flowing water nearby and I camped with Powerhouse, Pheriel, Weatherman, French fry, and Buckey.  I didn’t pick a very level spot to pitch my tent, and all night long, I was sliding down my sleeping pad to the foot of the tent. I would wake up, and then swim myself back up to the top of my sleeping pad. Made for a somewhat restless night."," Forest service Road 812

When I could stand it no more, and needed to get moving, I got up and started packing all my things. Everything was frigid. Everything I touch made my hands colder, and made my fingers hurt from the cold. It took me about 20 minutes or so to get everything rounded up and stuffed back in my pack. Once I started hiking, and had all my heavy clothing on as well as my mittens, I warmed up.  It was uphill for quite some time, but not too steep or strenuous. There were several nice areas to look out at the James river to the north. I ate a couple of candy bars for breakfast and lunch, and the trail started downhill. It was a long, long, downhill stretch for a couple of hours at least. Once I got down to the valley, there was a shelter called Mack’s Creek shelter. There is a very pretty creek that runs right next to the shelter.  After I had been there a few minutes, five day hikers came and sat at the picnic table with me. They asked a few questions about thru hiking, and then I left. The trail was fairly flat for the next 2 miles and ran alongside the creek. Very nice walk. I got to the foot bridge, and realized that it was a bridge that was just for the Appalachian Trail. There is no motorized  traffic allowed on it. I walked across the river, and then started an uphill climb. This stretch of the trail was along another creek, with beautiful footbridges crisscrossing it, and a nice swimming area at one point.   In a half mile or so, I walked down hill to the shelter. I was the only one there when I arrived. A few minutes later, Captain Black showed up, and then about a half an hour later, Buckey arrived. There’s a nice Creek right on the side of the shelter where we got water, and cooked supper. Captain Black has covered almost 800 miles since starting in Georgia earlier this year. Buckey and I slept in the shelter, he preferred to sleep in his  tent.  I am looking to go 8.8 miles tomorrow to the punch bowl shelter.","Marble Spring

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586764,"it was cold overnight again, but I slept pretty well. I got up, cooked a little breakfast of oatmeal, then cleaned my stove, packed my things and got on the trail. I noticed a strange pain that I had not felt  before today. It was in the area where my Achilles tendon meets my left calf muscle. The more I hiked, the more it hurt. I intended  to get to the next shelter, but with the big uphill that I was climbing, and this nagging injury, it was looking like I was not going to get there.  The day was getting quite warm, and the uphill  was the most strenuous I have had so far on my hike. I don’t know if the elevation is really that extreme, or if I was just having a bad day, but I was exhausted. 
 I changed my plans, and started looking for a flat place to pitch a couple of tents, as Buckey was behind me. It was quite a steep downhill, once I reached the peak, and there was no place to pitch a tent. I looked for a couple of hours, and finally the terrain flattened out at Salt Log gap. They were room for several tents, and I took off my pack and began to set up for the night. Buckey arrived 30 or so minutes later. 
 She reminded me, that there was no water at this spot, and there would be none for 3 1/2 miles or so tomorrow. We checked our packs, and we each had about 20 ounces of water. Not nearly enough! We were already thirsty from the hot day, and we had all night, plus a decent portion of the next day. 
 A couple of hikers came by, two ladies, and we asked them if they had any spare water. They said no they didn’t and then told us that the water at the Next shelter was rather sketchy and might be kind of dirty. Not good news.

It was a pretty big uphill to start the day, took about an hour and a half to two hours to get to the top of Bluff mountain. That was where I ran out of water completely. Buckey showed up, and she was out also. I took off my pack and laid in the green grass on the top of the mountain and rested for about 20 minutes. I did a face time with my wife, and showed her the beautiful views and explained the water situation.  She was very sympathetic, but nothing she could do. It would be another couple of hours of downhill hiking before I could even get to that dirty water source. 
 The downhill was not too bad, and passed fairly quickly. It got up probably around 80°, and I was sweating pretty good and getting pretty thirsty. I got ahead of Buckey, but when I got to the shelter trail, I stopped. When she caught up with me, I took her water bottles and mine, and went down and got us some water. The water source was a stagnant pond. The water was fairly clear, but just looked like water I wouldn’t want to drink.  I scooped some up in my bottle, and it was pretty clear. I filtered it, and drank a half a liter of it. It sure tasted good. I filled up her bottles, drank another half liter, and walked back up hill for a quarter of a mile to where Buckey was waiting. We sat there and together each drank another liter or two. We were certainly dehydrated. We walked the quarter mile or so to the Blue Ridge parkway and waited for our shuttle driver to arrive. He picked us up at about 2 o’clock, and brought us to Stanimals hostel.

The shuttle drivers had to make three trips to get us all back on the trail. I was in the third shuttle, due to the longer distance that I had to be driven. I got out on the trail about 10:15 AM. It was chilly, and windy, but very sunny and a great day to hike. The terrain was  easy to moderate, with most of it being surprisingly level. It went on around a beautiful lake, as well as many beautiful creeks and streams. All of them overflowing due to the recent rains. One Creek Crossing, was about ankle deep, and I had to hop from rock to rock to get across. A second creek Crossing was much deeper. I was lucky enough to see  A tree that had fallen across the creek a few yards upstream. I was able to crouch down, using my poles, and walk across it in a bent over fashion. I almost fell over three times, but was lucky enough to stay upright. The trail goes by an old farming community, that is now gone. It was a community of freed black slaves that were sharecroppers. They grew corn, and there was a grist mill in the area. All that is left are stone fences. When I got to the shelter, I cooked a quick supper, and got into my sleeping bag. Once the sun went down, it didn’t take long for it to get very cold.

When I woke up, it was so cold, I didn’t want to get out of my sleeping bag. The wind was blowing pretty good too. It’s very difficult to make yourself get out of the sleeping bag, put on your cold boots, and start packing up all of your cold items to put into your backpack. By the time that’s done, the fingers are burning from the cold. My toes were burning from cold also. About the time I finished with my backpack, I noticed it had begun to snow. This cold is demoralizing. I strapped on my pack, and headed on a steady uphill climb. Just before I left the shelter, Buckey told me that there was a highway 2 miles ahead. That’s in the back of my mind. As I was trudging up the trail,  I remembered the weather report stated that it would be a little bit colder tonight. I could manage to hike the 2500 feet up hill, as long as I can sleep somewhere comfortably. That was not going to happen tonight. These were the things that were going through my mind at the time. I wanted to get somewhere warm so I could sleep. It took me about an hopur and a half to two hours to get to the highway. Once I got there, there was a  rest area, and a few picnic tables. I took a seat at one. There was a shuttle driver who had just dropped off two hikers. She asked me if I would like a ride into town. I told her no and she sped away. I hadn’t decided yet. About five minutes later, another shuttle driver arrived, and two hikers came out of the woods and got into her van. I asked her where she was going, and she said Buena Vista. It would cost me five dollars to tagalong. I jumped in, and she dropped me at the Budget Inn in Buena Vista. I was finally warm! I thought about taking a couple of days off to let this cold air mass get out of this area. Then I started thinking about slack packing. I arranged for the shuttle driver to pick me up and deposit me all along the trail for the next several days so that I can keep getting somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 to 10 miles a day.

I still had several miles to go to the shelter, and didn’t know how much water I had. About an hour before I got to the shelter , I drank the last of my water out of my bladder. When I got to the shelter, my old hiking buddy, Buckey, was there. She filtered water for me, and I drank about 2 L. I think I was quite dehydrated by this time.

I hiked to my pick up spot, and left the mountains in the afternoon about 130. I got a shuttle ride to my hotel. I showered, walked back into town, and went to the local outfitter. Appalachian Outdoors Adventures in Luray Virginia is a great outfitter to go to. I bought a pair of hiking shoes, as well as some gaiters. I asked if someone could bring me across town to Walmart, which was 2 miles away. Not only did they bring me to Walmart, they also brought me to my hotel first to drop off my old boots, then to Walmart, waited while I shopped, then brought me back to my hotel.

Today’s objective was 12.2 miles away. I felt pretty strong, and didn’t have much difficulty. Things were going very well.  The second large elevation of the day, really sucked  all the energy out of me. It took much longer than I thought, and it was pretty hot. I could only go 100 yards or so and then have to stop and rest.  For me, the second half of every hiking day, my feet, ankles, and knees begin to hurt. If it is the third or fourth day in a row, my back likes to join in.  One of the really aggravating things on the trail, is that there is no place to sit that is comfortable. Forget about laying down to rest your back. It doesn’t exist. It was probably around  3 o’clock or so in the afternoon, and I was coming down one of the mountains. I crossed a road, and saw a parking lot. I noticed there was a car parked in the back, with a lift gate open. There were two people standing near the car. There were a couple of chairs, and what looked to be the cooler. I crossed my fingers, and hoped it was someone wanting to help out poor stinky,  hikers.  I was so lucky! It was two people who had through hiked a few years earlier. Their trail names were Splinter, and PJ.  They provided fruit, and water, and Gatorade to the thru hikers!   They even provided a chair for me to sit in. I drank a 20 ounce bottle of Gatorade, and it was so cold and so good!  I told him, that I thought the chair might be a better treat than the Gatorade!  I sat, and drank my Gatorade leisurely. Toward the end of my drink, an Englishmen, who was a through hiker, walked up. They began to engage with him, and I got up to leave. When I stood up, splinter told me she thought I would kill it! I thought, I have already killed my will to live! Done!! I had about 3 miles to go, and it was all downhill. The hiking was easy, and I got to the shelter feeling pretty good about myself.

This was a strange situation in that there were two shelters. An older one, that had a Geodesic  shape, and was called Dick’s dome.  The new shelter was about 100 yards away, and was called whiskey hollow shelter.

All of that changed as soon as I started packing up. I could not find the top to my pack! I knew It  had been in the shelter with me  yesterday, but it was nowhere to be found. My first thought was it had fallen out. I looked all around the shelter, went up to the privy, I even went to the other shelter looking for it. I asked the last two hikers who were at the other shelter if they had seen anything like that and they replied negatively. I went back to my shelter, and turned it upside down once again. Still nothing. I could not imagine a hiker having stolen it,  and so I started to think about animals. If it were a bear, I’m sure I would’ve heard it. So it must’ve been something smaller. So that’s when I started thinking maybe it were a smaller animal, and it was too big and heavy to drag  very far. I thought maybe it would be some where close in the woods. The first place I thought to look, was under the shelter. I turned the flashlight on my iPhone, and there it was. Under the middle of the shelter. I took one of my trekking poles, and pulled it back out. Whatever little animal had it, had broken open one of the zippered compartments.  It didn’t take long to look at the paw prints, and realize it was probably a raccoon. They apparently came into the shelter, grabbed what was closest to the entrance, and dragged it under the shelter looking for something to eat. There was no food in it, and so they abandoned it. Crisis averted! I packed my crap, and left the shelter. I had an 8.5 mile day, which is  not too bad for me. The hiking was actually nice today. I got to the next shelter early, but the rain was on the way. I got a prime position in the corner, and then just watched it fill up with hikers. There must’ve been 15 to 20 people either in the shelter or in tents  around the shelter. There was a group of young girls, and young guys. It was like  watching high school kids. Everything the guys did, made the girls giggle, and the two guys were acting like fools most the time.  I cooked my favorite supper, which is dirty rice with pepperoni and bacon bits. Very good!

I ended up spending a night at chimney rock campground. As soon as I got set up, a group of teenagers and their leader from Outward Bound showed up to set up for the night. They didn’t bother me, until it was time to go to sleep, and they kept shining their light at my tent. They gave it up pretty quickly, and I went to sleep. It was pretty cold overnight, and got down to around 52 in town. I’m not sure what that was up on the mountain, but it was colder than I wanted it to be."," Cobblestone hotel Wainsborough Pennsylvania

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593178,"The morning started rather cold  for June. It was around 52°. I got up around 730, and was on the trail for about 830. I planned on stopping at Caledonia state park, to eat at their snack bar. The hiking was easy, and I got there about 1 o’clock. I asked some of the people there and they said the snack bar was closed. It doesn’t open until this weekend. I was looking for a restroom, and I ran across a guy name Matt. He told me where the restroom was, and I asked him about the snack bar just to make sure . He said there was a great restaurant about a half mile north of here called the Timbers. I guess he saw the look on my face, because there was no way I was going to walk a half-mile to a restaurant. He offered to take me there, and then he ate lunch with me, and brought me back to the trail! The best trail magic yet! I had a nice bacon cheeseburger with fries! What a great guy! I bought his lunch. He’s a college kid, working on his masters degree  in clinical mental health. I got back on the trail, and went to the next shelter. It’s a beautiful shelter, well-maintained. I’ll take pictures and post them. It’s currently pouring down rain as I type this."," Chimney rock tent campground

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593432,"today, was going to be my longest hike so far with a full pack. I am attempting 13.6 miles. There are only a couple of Moderat elevations during the day, so I should be able to handle it. I walked through burned forest for a while today, and also stopped to rest at a shelter that has some very creepy history. I was leaving a shelter, and a hiker  that was southbound, informed me that the shelter I just left was the scene of a double murder many years ago. It was very creepy knowing that two women had been killed there. The hike was uneventful, and I got to my shelter at about 4 PM. Not a bad day!","Quarry Gap Shelter

Purple Haze,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593495,"I ended today at the half gallon challenge. I did not take up this challenge. I don’t think it would’ve ended well for me! I did eat a bacon cheeseburger and fries though. Pretty good. Today is my final date on the trail for this year. My knees ankles and feet are hurting too much at the end of each day to continue. I  May continue this adventure at a later date, but I want to rest, get home, and see my wife. So, that’s all for now, we’ll see what the future holds. This trail is tougher than I ever thought it would be. I have a newfound respect for those that actually finish. So, until the next chapter, so long.","Tom’ run shelter
