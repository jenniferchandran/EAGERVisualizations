TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586924,"My thru-hike is a long way off.  Career, kids, life are keeping me right where I need to be for now.  I don't remember when or how I got the AT bug.  I remember about 13-14 years ago finding the Trailjournals and I would read through them for an hour or more each night.  It was an escape from what I felt was a pretty dismal existence at the time.  That seems like a long time ago and I've changed a lot.  I'm a much, much happier person now and I seek out things that enhance my life and happiness.  
I usually plan vacations with my partner, but she's busy with starting a new business, so I figured I might as well hit the trail for a week.  I've done car camping with the kids and a few overnights in the back country here and there, but I haven't put any serious miles in over multiple days.  We all got to start somewhere right?  The plan is to start in Port Clinton, PA and hike to the Delaware Water Gap or (if I'm cruising) make it to the Mohican Outdoor Center in five days.  I picked this section out of sheer pragmatism.  It's about an hour and a half drive from my home and I can get dropped off and picked up without causing too much hassle.  
Long time readers of trailjournals and seasoned hikers might be thinking, ""Slow down, son!!!  You can't just jump on the AT on a whim!!""  I hear you.  And maybe I am being naive, but I'm willing to make a mistake.  Here's a little bit about me just so you can make an informed wager on whether or not I'm gonna die out there.  I'm 44 years old.  I try to keep in decent shape.  I run 3 times a week and weight train 2 days.  I don't consider myself a fitness freak and, to be honest, a good number of days I don't like working out, but in the big picture it makes me feel good so I just do it.  I've been fortunate in my job to do a lot of travel to developing countries so I've acquired some adapting skills.  Again, I'm not bragging and I made a lot of mistakes but most of the time it was sink or swim kinda stuff.  Another asset which is comical but not to be discounted, is that when i was going through that rough patch, I fantasized daily about thru-hiking.  Meticulous day-dreaming about gear, food, clothes.  Full-on screenplays about all the cool people I would meet and  how my crazy adventures would become the stuff of AT legend and how I would be crowned Trail King!!!  
Anywho, even if I could have gone way back when, it would have been for all the wrong reasons.  And even when it was for the right reasons, I foolishly kept telling myself that I couldn't do any of it until I was ready to do all of it.  That's the kind of silly self talk that qualifies us out of a lot of great experiences.  So the planets aligned where I had some extra money to buy some gear, and the time to take off work.  So I'm doing it.

TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587031,"I updated my gear list. In case your wondering why I'm journaling about my tiny section hike, it's just an outlet until I get out there.  I don't expect this to be read with so many other entries out there, but I seem to be thinking about the hike an awful lot, so for me, its better just to put some energy into this journal instead of have my thoughts rattle around in my head all day.  I don't know if anybody can relate, but after the bulk of the planning and the gear purchases were complete, there doesn't seem like much to do except for wait.  I guess I'm getting antsy, and nervous.  
I got most of my guidance for gear from https://www.theadventurejunkie... It might be a little over commercialized, but I'm a little lazy when it comes to in-depth researching and this site seems to have a lot of ""one-stop shopping"" info.  All in all, I probably laid out $1,200 for all the stuff.  Included in that cost was some Mountain House meals i bought for my dinners and 3 wicking T shirts and a pair of Columbia hiking pants (the kind with the zip-off legs).  I bought 2 dry sacks, one for food and the other for clothes.  It was a lot of money but I figured I'm going to have the stuff for a long time and my next section hike's cost will just be food and transportation.  I already have a decent pair of Vasque hiking boots and a sleeping bag that I've had for a while.  The bag is probably more than I need for the weather, but I couldn't bring myself to shell out the money for a new one.  
Having acquired all the stuff, I loaded my pack, filled up the camelbak, and added 2 five lbs. dumbells just because.  I was up in Ithica at the time, so I went to Robert Treman State park and hiked up the Rim Trail and then back down the Finger Lakes Trail.  Within the first 20 minutes my hips were screaming!!  and I immediately started thinking that something was majorly wrong and that the whole thing was a huge mistake and that I wasn't cut out for hiking.  BUT...  I pushed through and even though it was slightly uncomfortable for a while, everything settled in and I was just fine.  I think I did about 6 miles in approx 3 hours which I was pretty happy with.  The hike was beautiful.  It had snowed the night before and there was a about an inch covering of pristine white.  I didn't feel cold with the exertion of the hike, but when i went to snack on my clifbar I realized it was frozen.  I'm glad I had my trekking poles because the trail was a bit icy in spots.
I know it wasn't a true test of the AT conditions, but I felt pretty good about it.  The pack felt good and my shoulders weren't sore at all, so I guess I had it positioned correctly.  I figured I would be sore the next day, but surprisingly I wasn't.  I probably won't replicate that experience on the AT but that's ok.

TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587141,"I've been reading the journals of the thru-hikers that started this year.  I imagine this late winter is making things a bit more challenging for everybody.  I equally admire those who are sticking with it and those who re-assessed and delayed their start.  Both decisions take humility and courage.
Food on the trail has been on my mind.  Journals, youtubes, and articles have giving me a rough idea.  I'm gonna stick with the mountain house entrees for dinner.  Lunch will probably be tuna packets w/ olive oil and mustard on tortillas.  Breakfast is a toss up.  I have already purchased Justin's Almond Butter packets so they will be in the mix.  I don't eat a hot breakfast at home (yogurt, berries, and granola) so I don't think I'll heat anything up on the trail.  Can't decide or granola, pop-tarts, or breakfast bars.  As I'm typing this out I realize it doesn't have to be either-or and I can do all three and just switch it up every couple of days.  I don't want to make the mistake of bringing too much, b/c i'm watching the weight but I don't want to be super hungry all the time either.  Oh well.  I have time to figure it out.  Gorp, clifbars, and snickers sound like good snacks.

TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587718,"I still have things to do before the hike but, true to my usual form, I keep putting it off.  20 days to go.  I still have to get my food list written and then purchase the food.  Come to think of it, I don't have a pack check-off list, which I need to have or else I'll forget something.  There's other stuff too, like making sure I have enough cordage and various other knick-knacks like a carabiner, etc. I'm kinda bummed that I can't find my Black Diamond head lamp.  I've had it for years and no matter where I look, it hasn't turned up yet.  I think the procrastination is a product of fear and doubt.  ""What if I can't do it."" ""What if I get out there and I hate it.""  Insane thoughts really, because my history proves otherwise.  One of the themes I've seen in a lot of journals is:  don't worry, just put one foot in front of the other and the miles will come.  That's good advise.  So I'll keep doing what I can to prepare and it will get done.Which reminds me.  I am extremely grateful to all who have honestly shared about their trail experiences.  The wisdom I have gleaned from the journals has been invaluable.  You certainly have inspired many to go out there and give it a try, including this guy.  Thank you very much.Sarah, thanks for signing the guest book.  It reminded me that I don't hike the trail.  We do.Again, thanks for indulging me as I give some air to my thoughts",,View Entry,"Apr 23, Mon",0
TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589396,"Just a quick entry to update my current status.  I finally sat down and typed out a checklist of all the gear/food/clothes I need to bring.  Now that it on paper it seems a lot more manageable.  I have all the gear & clothes, I just need to make sure it gets packed.  I picked a rough outline of a daily menu and calculated the calories.  It comes out to around 2000 per day and most of my food averages around 100 cal/per oz so I guess i'm doing ok there.  I have the speciality items like the mountain house meals and larry & lenny's nutritional cookies.  Now I just have to go to the store and buy the other items.  Work is going to be a little busy this week which is good and bad.  Good because it will keep me from unnecessarily obsessing about the hike but bad because it leaves little time for last minute planning or adjustments(that could be a good thing too).One week to go!  Gotta put down my fears here so they won't rattle around in my head.  Ridiculous fears this week:  pooping in the woods, socializing on the trail (i'm awkward around new people), and the most ridiculous fear of all- fear of looking like i don't now what i'm doing.  Ludicrous because a) I don't know what i'm doing (yet) and b) there is no logical reason why I should care.",,View Entry,"May 07, Mon",0

TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591393,"Got a room at the Port Clinton Hotel last night.  Went to the bar to get the key and the lady asked me if I was a hiker.  I never identified myself that way, but it was cool to think, ""Well, I guess I am.""  I got on the trail around 6:20am.  It was a long ascent to get to cruising altitude.  I was sweating in no time but then settled into the trail quickly.  I heard about the rocks in PA and was not disappointed, but I felt like the trail punished me just to the point of my limit and then she let off a bit and gave me a nice soft path for a while.  After I stopped for lunch, the rocks weren't so bad.  I few day-hikers passed me throughout the day.  One of them saw me eating lunch later and asked if I caught the view at the Pinnacle.  It's a little off the trail so I must have walked right by it.  It was close so I went back (w/o my pack) and the view was worth it.  If you don't want to miss it, just walk off the trail straight past the huge pile of rocks and you'll see it.I got to Eckville Shelter around 4:30.  I needed the practice, so I set up my tent in the tent area across the street.  This shelter area is like the ritz-carlton of the AT.  I'm pretty sore for my first day but overall I feel pretty good about everything.","Port Clinton Hotel (1218.9)

TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591395,"Climbed out of the Eckville Shelter to Dan's Pulpit.  Ahhh, Dan.  I love your views but I hate your rocks!!  Shortly after the pulpit I heard then saw a rattlesnake just two feet off the trail.  I have some experience running into rattlers and I don't worry too much b/c my theory is that they are going to let you know they are there, and this guy certainly did.  The trail today was mostly level but it was pretty slow going for me b/c of all the rocks.  The big rocks aren't so bad b/c a little rock-hopping can break the monotony of the trail, but the fields of ground-level foot sized rocks do make progress challenging.  But just like yesterday, there seemed to be a smoother trail after I breaked for lunch.  I knew there was a T-storm predicted so I tried to boogie in the afternoon to get to camp.  With two miles left, the wind started blowing, and the the thunder and lightening started.  It wasn't right on top of me so I decided to push through.  I even started running for a few 5 minute stretches at a time.  The temp dropped and the rain came down.  It hailed for about a minute for crying out loud!  I was cold and soaked but I made it to the camp site and set up my tent in the rain.The rain stopped right after I set up camp.  Kudos to me for starting a fire with wet wood using toilet paper and olive oil.  No one was more surprised it worked than me!  Ultimately, it proved to be a waste of time b/c it didn't dry out one stitch of my wet clothes or my boots.  Oh well, it gave me something to do for a few hours so not all was lost.Forecast calls for rain tomorrow so i'm setting my alarm so i can pack up while it's still dry.","Eckville Shelter (1233.7)

TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591448,"I don't even want to talk about it.  I met some nice hikers though.
****Edit:  The above is what I wrote in my journal the night of the 16th.  I can elaborate now that I am back on dry land.  It was a hard day.  It rained hard most of the day, the temp dropped, and the trail was challenging with a lot of rocks.  I had my first experience with, ""How do they expect me to do that!?!?"" when I got to the Knife's Edge.  Looking back it wasn't that bad but it just took me off guard.  Before I got there I ran into Just Bob, he was happy to chat a bit and he told me about the challenges coming up.  He was encouraging and said if I was careful about my foot placement everything would be just fine.  He was right.  While on the knife's edge two guys said their hellos and then flew by me.  All day it was just a lot of rock climbs up, down, and across.  The rain was continuous and I spent all day in soggy boots.  I don't know if it was just my boots or everybody has this problem, but they were like ice skates on top of the wet rocks.  So in addition to paying attention to my footing, I had to make sure that any rock on an angle and a ""bracing rock"" next to it so my foot wouldn't slide off.  
Met a younger hiker named Little Spoon, he was a thru hiker that started at Springer March 5.  He was cruising and seemed to glide over the rocky trail. Nice kid.
I stopped for a break to give my feet a rest at the Bake Oven Knob shelter and met Mighty Mouse who was a section hiker that started in Harper's Ferry.  She was nice, pleasant conversationalist, and a good distraction, but the longer I sat, the more I started to shiver from lack of exertion so I headed out to get the blood pumping.
Anyway, after a long, challenging, cold and wet day (at least one section took me an hour to go 1 mile)I decided to cut my mileage short and stop at the Outerbridge shelter for the night.  Well the universe had other plans.  I was relieved to get to the shelter but I was immediately met by a 20 something couple that instantly got under my skin.  Disclaimer:  they were just kids having a good time and not doing anything wrong, I was just exhausted and in a pissy mood.  But when I saw the pack full of coors light tall boys, and the girl telling her beau that he had to take it easy tonight after throwing up three times that day, I knew I couldn't stay there.  Little spoon was there eating his dinner and gave me a sympathetic look.  So I moved on.  I felt a little defeated and just wanted to get to a place to set up camp but I knew that was a ways off because I was entering the Lehigh Gap.  I had my head down and bolted right past the spring where two guys were filling up.  It was the guys who passed me at the knife's edge.  One of the guys said, ""Oh hey, we passed you earlier!  Don't you want to get water?  There's nothing drinkable for ten miles.""  Now I knew this, but i was still irritated about the shelter so wasn't thinking about it.  I loaded up on water and thank goodness i did, i wouldn't have made it if i didn't.  I never got to thank that guy for pulling my head out of my butt, but he definitely saved my bacon.
I'm rambling so I'll end with this- The ascent out of the Lehigh Gap is a vertical 900 feet rock climb, and not something I wanted to do in the rain and after a long day.  I'm scared of heights so that didn't help.  But I did it, and looking back it was a big accomplishment for me and I'm grateful for the experience.  
I set up camp in the rain right at the intersection of the superfund detour and crashed.","New Tripoli Campsite (1247.0)

TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591460,"I woke up around 5:30 and assessed my situation.  My boots are were still wet and it was supposed to rain at least the first part of the day.  No way my boots will dry out on the trail and my feet won't take much more of being wet all the time.  My plan is to hike the 20 miles to Wind Gap so I can get a room to dry out my boots in order to make the final push into my destination at Delaware Water Gap.  
I was on the trail by 7:30 and i knew it was going to have to be go go go if i was going to make it in decent time.  So that's what i did, just hiked, one foot in front of the other.  I took short breaks and ate on the go.  I took a longer break at Delps Trail and changed my socks since the rain had stopped.  I hiked down to get water to last me the rest of the day.  The trail was still very wet, but the rocks didn't seem too bad.  Overall, a nice hike through misty fern-covered woods.  
I made it to Rt 33 around 7:45pm but had to walk another 3 miles to the travel inn.  I got a room and went right back out to Wendy's for a chicken sandwich and fries.  Finally got in and was able to check out my feet.  Man, were they in rough shape.  Bruised toenails, big bloody blisters, and overall white and prune-like.  I took a shower and then tended to my feet.  All patched up, I situated all my gear and went to bed.","Stealth Site (1259.9)

TBDName,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591669,"I am so grateful that I was able to finally get out there and do some hiking. Some observations:  I'm a runner, and my experience running is that it seems to take forever but the miles fly by.  5 minutes running at a decent clip seems like 30 minutes.  The trail was the opposite.  The time flew by!!!  3 hours of hiking went by in the blink of an eye.  The miles, however did not come so quickly.  In my head I was calculating that I must have covered x number of miles in an amount of time, and the reality was always that my estimate was way off.  The lesson is not to worry about the miles so much.  Even though the miles didn't seem to be going fast enough, I always made it to my planned destination, so its just a matter of outlook.Preparing for the hike I had read several times that the number one mistake rookies make is that they bring too much food and I swore I wasn't going to be that guy.  Guess what?  I was that guy.  The first 2 days I was choking down my planned meals even when I wasn't hungry because ""I had to keep up my calories.""  By day 3 my stomach was upset from my diet switch from the stuff I ate at home to the processed foods on the trail.  After that I still ate, but I mostly snacked just because I didn't really feel hungry.  I quickly got a resentment for carrying around an extra 7 lbs of food that I knew I wouldn't eat.  The lesson here is that next time I need to listen to my body more and eat when I'm hungry and not force it when i'm not.  Had I been on the trail for weeks/months I'm sure my body's demands would have changed and I could adjust accordingly.Overall, I think I disadvantaged myself with too strict of a timeline.  I think i've learned that hiking from a to z in x number of days is ok as a rough guideline but it can't be the rule.  I had to cut my hike short because I didn't have enough time to let my feet heal.  Next time I need to concentrate on the hike itself and not get so caught up in the times and distances.  Or at least make decisions about that stuff on a day to day basis based on the current situation.Thanks again to all who hike and share their experiences, I really would not have been successful without the wisdom that you have passed on.  Even though I did have a moment or two of ""I don't think I'm cut out for this"" while I was out there, they were just fleeting thoughts and I am sure I'll be strapping on the pack again and hitting the trail again soon.  I found it very peaceful the way the trail guides you into living in the present moment.Safe travels and happy hiking!PS.  I still didn't get a trail name, maybe next hike!",,View Entry,"May 24, Thu",0
