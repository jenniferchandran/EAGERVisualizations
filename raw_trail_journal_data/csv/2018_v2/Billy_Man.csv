Billy_Man,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585881,last day with Jaepaer on the trail for a while. I will probably hike with him again when he gets to north of Pearisburg VA which is where I stopped my last section hike. I have completed the trail from springer to North of Pearisburg. And now I have completed the approach trail from Amicalola Falls State Park.  Jaepaer was ready for a short day and stayed at Woody Gap at the hostel in the top of the grocery store in Suches GA.   It was a short but tough hike today. Very windy and cold. Wind chill in 20’s. Was glad to get to the store and have a pizza and warm place to relax. Met nice young couple who were thru hiking. DB and I gave them some food and a near full fuel canister.   Good finish and now Jaepaer will be off and running at full speed in the morning.,"Gooch Gap Shelter
