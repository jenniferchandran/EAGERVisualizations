Swift,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493577,I have decided to set my date to hike the AT. So I guess I'm making it official 2018 I'll set out to hike the AT.I have been wanting to do this for a long time. Reading all the journals is very encouraging to say the least but almost a tease wanting to be out there my self.,,can't wait,"May 09, Sat",0
Swift,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497553,Started out at sexton hollow rd. On section m13 of the finger lakes trail going west to birds eye hollow. It was my dad and I for the next 4 days. Started late today. 1pm start time to be exact. And my dad was a little tired to start. And had to much in his pack. So we turned around and went back to the truck. I help him start taking items out of his bag that he didn't need. I think we removed about 7 pounds. After we restarted it went well. But my dad was still tired. Being he is 72 he was doing great! We stopped at moss shelter. It's really nice with two streams merging into one. I set my hammock up at the point of the two streams. Had a nice fire pit that we used. It was early but I didn't mind. We only hiked 3 miles in. My dad I think was discouraged about the up hill sections and I know he wanted to set camp.       Critter today- 4 snakes and a frog. I'm hoping that's all we will see for the remainder of the night .,,moss shelter,"May 26, Tue",0
Swift,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497555,"Last night in the middle of the night my dad needed to relieve himself. Well when he went to get back into his hammock. I heard thud. Right on the ground he went. Then this morning he told me he did that twice. Lol. Well today we did 9 miles. Left moss shelter at 9am. Cold last night. After performing our morning rituals the hike was really nice. But the road walking. Ugh! Sore feet. need I say more. Made it to birdseye hollow park. We were both very tired. There were several foundation's from old days and 2 very old cemeteries . Some stone back to the late 1700. Beautiful day and a nice breeze. I brought way to much food and I'm not happy with my cooking. I need to revisit that after this trip is over.        Critters-3 snakes,2 frogs,1 deer,4 chipmunk and 2 Turkey buzzards keeping a very dead raccoon company.",,Birdseye hollow day park,"May 27, Wed",0
Swift,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497556,"Last night we got some rain. No real heavy but enough to make things slippery this morning. Took some time and checked out the day park. It is really nice. Big pond and a pavilion with several cooking spots. My dad got pissed on by a turtle by the pond. Funniest thing. Lol. I'll come back here at some point and have a party. Passed some really nice spots today. No big views but some interesting ones. Had lunch sitting on a nice bridge over a creek. It was a very nice afternoon. We hiked to Irene's campsite to set up camp. Take water if you stop not much up here. Other than that it's nice. got the fire going and at the moment no bugs to speak of. Planned a short day today only 5 miles so we can finish tomorrow in Hammondsport so tomorrow will be an 8 mile day. but mostly down hill.   Critters-a very small baby deer,squirrels to many to count, several turtles at birds eye pond. That was    cool. And 2 frogs.Today was good",,Irene's camp site,"May 28, Thu",0
Swift,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497557,"woke up early this morning. got really cold in the night. my dad couldn't put on enough clothes, ended up wrapping himself up in the space blanket and crawling back into his hammock. to start our hike it was a 3 mile road trek. which wasn't too bad until the last half a mile. the road was really steep and I could feel the hot spot forming on my foot. for the most part the woods walk was kind of nice. until we got to the part where we had to go straight up to 1800ft for about a half a mile. I was really hoping to see some great views. but the trees have grown up so much that you can't see anything through the leaves. so I might go back after the fall just so I can get a view without the leaves. a lot of the sections on the top of the ridge has been logged. so some sections were hard to find the trail. for the most part the whole trail that we have hiked has been pretty well marked. making our way down from an elevation of 1800 feet to 800 feet was really hard on my knee. Also my dad had blisters on his toes. so I guess the downhills can be just as hard as the up hills. my sister in law was nice enough to come pick us up. she waited for at the gas station across from the vinehurst inn. she treated us to a nice cold Gatorade. Being that we did 3 miles on the road I'm afraid I missed out on a lot of critters.I didn't have much of an appetite. I think next time I'll take a lot less food. I pretty much force myself to eat just to lighten my load.          First craving-a nice cold beer. after 4 days of sweating on this trail I think I really want one.  Critters- 1 deer, lot of chipmunks and a big snake. I've seen just as many snakes as I have Chipmunks on this trail.",,Vinehurst Inn,"May 29, Fri",0
