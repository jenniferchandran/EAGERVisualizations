Elizabeth Reitman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580525,"Dear Enzo-
In 6 months time, you will be wandering the house wondering where the hell I am. You will be missing your snuggle buddy and forever best friend. Seth will be singing your dinner time songs and cheering you on as you pee. Hopefully he will be playing “find me!” and spraying your hotspots with anti-itch medicine. Do not dispair! I will return, stronger and braver and better than ever! So many kisses and butt rubs will be coming your way!
 It wasn’t an easy decision to leave for all these months and I promise to give you and the rest of our family and friends the blow by blow of my adventures that I’m sure they are so eager to devour. By now you have overheard us talking about my thru hike. Or shall I say, so as not to get ahead of myself, my attempted thru hike. You certainly have sat by patiently while I create a ridiculous amount of spread sheets and preoccupiedly watch YouTube videos on how to make my own pot coozies. You layed under my feet as I researched the best and lightest water filtration system hacks and scrutinized my gear weight to the 0.01 ounce. You’ve sacrificed walks around the block and instead watched me sweat like a pig on the treadmill with 30 lbs of kitty litter strapped to my back. You have been the most loyal preparation companion and I can’t thank you enough. While I’m gone, take care of Seth and your siblings because they too have made this dream a possibility. Without Seth, this would not be happening. 
On April 8, 2018 I set out on a walk that will take me from Georgia to Maine in hopefully 4 months time. That’s right. I will walk. The whole way. The Appalachian Trail will be my home, my workspace, my joy, and my burden. It will be the most challenging endeavor I have ever attempted. It will be, I hope, the most rewarding endeavor I’ve ever completed. I will breath fresh air, share a sleeping space with strangers, test my physical abilities to their limits, and probably ( definitely) get poison ivy a few times. I can only hope to stink so horribly I will scare away the mosquitos. It’s going to be epic.
While I’m gone, I ask you to please behave. Be good to the kids, don’t get hurt, and maybe come and visit me once or twice while I’m gone. You may even be able to hike a little with me if you promise not to pull at squirrels and growl at my weird trail family. I’m sure they will be as gross and strange looking as me. Every now and then I will howl at the sky and hope you and Tazia and Remi are howling in the bedroom ( I’m still not sure why you guys do that!) 
Until we see each other again, the most love to you and everyone!!

Elizabeth Reitman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580616,"Dear Dad,This entry goes to you for one reason alone... spreadsheets. You are the king of spreadsheets and I am starting to understand why. It sounds sick to even admit the calming satisfaction that comes from creating a detailed spreadsheet: being able to look proudly at your intense organizational skills. It’s gotta be a form of OCD and I suggest that when I’m done with this hike we both get the psychological help we desperately need:). The planning has taken on a quest of its own! I found a delicious web page that allowed me to organize a tentative plan to average 15 miles a day and resupply within a mile of the trail while only carrying on average 3-5 day’s worth of food. I stumbled on this and have been using it to create a spreadsheet that will allow Seth to know where I plan to resupply and where he may send me care packages. My biggest concern is running out of food and coming to a town that either a: has only gas station food choices or b: requires a long walk or a hitch many miles from the trail to get to a store. I know that hitching or using a shuttle into town is an inevitability, but if I’m feeling good and on a roll I would love to have a mile or less walk to adequate options and the ability to push on if I want. So thanks Dad in advance- I may not know all the bells and whistles of my excel program but I will admit I may be a future spreadsheeter from here on out. Another exciting event yesterday was getting my Sawyer Mini and playing around with the water bottle options! What a dorky thing to be excited about but my second biggest concern is the water situation out on the trail. I wanted to have something that is first and foremost ultralight and secondly can be used as both an emergency tool to drink from puddles and as a tool to collect water from large sources like a river or lake. I saw tons of Sawyer Minis on the trail in the last two years and it seems to be a popular and practical option. I also found that the Figi 1.5 L water bottle will fit the Smartwater sport cap so I was thrilled about this. Now I can carry 3 L of drinkable water if I so choose without having to bring along my hydration bladder. I’ve read horror stories of the bladders leaking and soaking all the contents of your pack. This could be both dangerous and uncomfortable, especially in cold weather. So I feel like I’m solidly committed to the Sawyer Mini and 2 1.5 L water bottles instead. Another exciting event occurred last night during my 45 minute treadmill punishment. I call it a punishment because who the hell really wants to walk on max incline with 30 lbs of kitty litter in their backpack? When I announced this to my husband and stepkids, that I was due to excericse that evening, my step daughters enthusiatically volunteered to keep me company. Their actual response to my announcement was “ Seriously!? I’ve gotta see this!” They both played on their IPads next to the treadmill while I huffed and puffed and sweated my butt off for 45 mins. For any of you that know me well, the fact that they sat with me without my asking or prompting was a huge moment and made me feel really good. I hope that while I’m gone they have fun following my progress rather than being happy I’m not around ( like I fear they will). One less exciting aspect of this planning phase has been trouble falling asleep and waking in the middle of the night. It’s like my brain just won’t shut off! I know it’s excitement for doing the hike but it’s also nerves. There’s just so many things that could happen between now and my starting. I’m terrified that something will happen that will prevent me from even beginning. The overwhelming disappointment of not even being able to start is almost paralyzing. That’s one of the reasons why I haven’t openly shared this journal yet and why I haven’t told anyone other than my husband and my friend Sarah that this is my plan for next year. I fear the responses from people, most especially you Dad, and Mom. But to be honest, I’ve found this type of adventure mesmerizing from the moment you told me about your hike across Michigan in your younger days. It’s something that you have talked about a lot and when I get older I would love to have this epic story to share with the kids and grandkids one day. What’s even more fun for me to think about is that in my story, the kids will have lived it along with me. I wish I could have followed you on your adventures and hope that you can be proud of me for going on my own!Libby",,View Entry,"Nov 18, Sat",0
Elizabeth Reitman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580826,"Dear Seth-This entry goes to my husband who has been so awesome during these early planning stages. It still is amazing to me to think back to when we first really talked about me doing this hike. How nervous I was to bring it up seriously and how I hoped that your response would be what it was. I’m not sure what I truly expected, but full-hearted 100% complete support was NOT It and was shocked with how easily you said “ you should do it”. I don’t know if you realize how long I’ve been thinking about this hike but I feel like it really has been years. We talked about it in the Smokies, in Arkansas, and of course in Maine. We’ve talked about it at home, out to dinner, walking the dogs, just about everywhere and I’m sure you will be happy when it doesn’t dominate our conversation anymore. I wish you could share the full experience with me but understand this is “not your thing”. I can’t even say enough how much it means that you are supporting me through “ my thing”. I really hope that I can return the favor one day in such epic proportions!!Love you!!Libby",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Mon",0
Elizabeth Reitman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580886,"Dear Pretty,
To be honest, I wouldn’t have thought a letter to you would work itself into this journal so early on but I see you chilling so comfortably on the couch and couldn’t help myself. I came across a video yesterday of a cat camping with its family and effectively chasing away a black bear! It actually charged the bear roaming around their campsite and made it tree itself like three times before chasing it away. It was absolutely hilarious and that cat didn’t look scared at all. I thought of you, surrounded by three big dogs, brave and stubborn, staking your claim on the couch arm. You go girl! I don’t say it enough and I’m sorry. 
I don’t know why I’m feeling sentimental about you right now, but if I can have half of your stubbornness on the trail I think it will be a huge benefit. That “ I’m sitting here and you can’t scare me away” attitude is somewhat inspiring. In a huge stretch of application, I hope I think of you in the morning when it’s pouring rain with no indication of letting up. I hope I can say “I’m going out there and you (Nature) can’t scare me away from completing this goal”. 
I’m sure you haven’t noticed (because you’ve been sleeping all day) that I have added to my growing gear collection. Again. During my trip to REI yesterday I purchased some new rain pants and exchanged those big Solomon hiking shoes for some light and fluffy Altras. The most recent internal debate has centered around boots vs trail runners. I know you could give two cat turds about this but I’m sure I’m not the only planner contemplating this decision. I love my boots, broken in and warm. But I’m not gonna love them for 4 months straight so trying out an alternative is high on my list of priorities. I think what I’m gonna do is start out with the Solomon hiking boots for “winter” and then switch over to the trail runners once I’m out of the Smokies. I thought trying the Solomon hiking shoes would be a good boot alternative but after trying them on at home I quickly decided my boots were far superior for stability and far more comfortable. So that’s my decision, as of today. 
It’s a rainy, crappy day out today so what I plan to do is gather all my gear and take a look at what I’ve got. I had to exert some major self control yesterday at REI to not buy tons of stuff just to save a few ounces. It was gear porn at its finest and I succeeded in resisting. I need to take a close look at what I have and ask myself is it really worth $80 just to save 2 ounces? I’ve gotta have a limit somewhere. Plus, spreading out all my gear on the floor and weighing it is one of my favorite pastimes. Sick, I know. Welcome to the life of a hiker! Vacuuming the floor first is probably in order so that I don’t inadvertently take the fur of you and your siblings along with me on this hike. I’m kinda looking forward to not being itchy, no offense. 
Cheers!

Elizabeth Reitman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582212,"Dear Laura,When I first told you I was going to be attempting this hike, I was pleasantly surprised by your response. I thought for sure I was going to get the expected youre quitting your job!? To....hike?!. Instead the first comments out of your mouth were you cant do that, someone will kill you. And it was said with such plain fact. Like , how could I have not determined that on my own? Lol. It was great, so great in fact that Ive started writing down everyones reaction and words when I first tell them this is what I will be doing this summer. Its been a source of many chuckles over the last few weeks and I cant wait to look back on them post hike and remind everyone what their first thoughts were. Here are a few of my favorites I thought everyone might enjoy:1. Omg, thats like everyones dream!2. * hands covering mouth in awe/ horror* wait, does that mean you will wear the same clothes for 6 months?!3. Silence and stares4. Thats cool. Tone almost equivalent to whatever5. The 100 questions such as what shoes will you wear? What will you eat? How many miles will you do each day? Will you meet up with friends or family? What do you do for a shower?6. Just make sure you dont come back with a million cavities. - the dentist7. So youre gonna quit your job and what? Just figure it out later? * said with haughty disaproval* 8. I wish I could do that.These are some of my favorites so far. The big ones will be from my parents and grandparents Im sure. I also cant wait to hear what my brother says. Probably something along the lines of cant believe it took you this long to do it .  I havent shared my plans yet with the rest of the family, and frankly am just pain scared to do so. I cant stand the thought of the next few months being filled with the stressor of everyone else stressing out about my decision and upcoming hardships. In a way, im also sparing them. Youre welcome.  I had a few exciting gear changes since the last update and with some trepidation am proud to announce my switch from my osprey bag to ULA circuit which is about half the weight. I loaded all my shit in it last week and there was room enough for food so I was very pleased. It also felt like I was wearing a fluffy cloud. I couldnt beleive at how light it felt ( minus food and water) and I hurried to the scale to check my base weight. 20 lbs. I almost crapped my pants. Ive been scrutinizing over items, changing things up to be lighter, sacrificing non essentials. And its apparently paid off. I was more than pleased!I would like to end my letter today by encouraging you and the rest of the family and even friends with interests in the AT or backpacking in general, to listen to Mighty Blue on the AT podcast. I am LOvInG this pre hike Immersion into everything AT and Steve does some very insightful and reassuring interviews regarding safety and the challenges I will be facing. I think everyone supporting a hiker (me) should listen to it so that they can know what Im going through and how to help be supportive and encouraging. Not over- protective and nervous (mom). Theres nothing to worry about other than me not being able to complete and my mental psyche if that occurs. Everything else is relative and manageable. In the end, I am going out to do something I love and want to do SO bad. If I get eaten by a bear, then thats ok. Just kidding mom!Laura, I expect you to be my spokesperson since you do such a good job of it. You play referee to all the naysayers or worrywarts please so I can keep some sanity!:) thanks ahead of time! Well until next time, Ill leave it with a very cliche nature quote, since I havent done that yet!Keep close to Natures heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean.",,View Entry,"Jan 19, Fri",0
