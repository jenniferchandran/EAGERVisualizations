Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586377,"Hello,
This is my trail journal. I will be using this to keep track of and share with you my experiences as I hike the Appalachian Trail.  
In this initial entry I’d like to answer some common questions that I’ve been asked recently. 
What is the Appalachian Trail?
The Appalachian Trail (AT) is a connection of hiking trails that link Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine. It is 2,190 miles long, passes through 14 states and has approximately 465,000 feet of elevation gain/loss. The trail-blazing began in 1925 and finished in 1937 but took several decades to gain popularity. Currently, 2-3 million people visit sections of the AT every year with about 3000 attempting a thru-hike and a quarter of those thru-hikers finishing. 
What am I doing?
I will be attempting a northbound thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. On April 13th I will be taking a train from New Jersey down to Georgia where I will begin the following day at the southern terminus, Springer Mountain. 
How long will it take?
I am aiming to finish between 5 and 6 months which is a typical pace.  The window for northbound hikers is March to October. It is certainly possible to hike the AT outside that window but you will be dealing with harsher conditions. For Southbound hikers beginning in Maine the window is later, about June to December. 
Where do I sleep?
A combination of tent, lean-to shelters, hiker hostels, and occasionally hotels. Camping can be done along the trail or in designated campsites. Campsites can have lean-to shelters which is usually a three-sided building which will protect you from the elements. 
What about food/water?
The AT passes through towns every 3-5 days most of the hike so resupply on food or gear is fairly simple. You usually just need to find a way in and out of town. Resupply boxes from friends/family are also common too if there are specific types of food  or gear you want. 
Water comes from natural resources. River, stream, lake, puddle. But it must be treated by chemicals or filter. I will be carrying a filter which I will cover later in an entry on my gear. 
How do I navigate?
From beginning to end the AT is marked every couple hundred feet by a white blaze. That’s a painted white vertical rectangle. Even though the trail is marked it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t bring tools to navigate though. I will be bringing with me ‘The AT Guide’ by David Miller. This is a compact summary of notable locations along the trail. Everything from water sources, campsites and shelters, scenic views and towns with their accompanying resources such as stores and taxi/shuttle services. I will also be carrying a GPS to keep in contact with my parents as they will be my main points of contact throughout my journey.
Won’t I be lonely?
Nope. There where be all kinds of hikers on the trails and especially at campsites and shelters. AT hikers group up frequently too since they are hiking the same trail and are experiencing similar circumstances. 
 
Isn’t it dangerous? What about storms, bears and other wildlife?
No, hiking the AT and hiking in general is not dangerous as long as you plan ahead, have the right gear, and make smart decisions along the way. Yes, there are bears in the wilderness. They hate humans. Encounters are far and few between and rarely ever result in an altercation. But planning and respect for bears’ territory is very important. Keeping campsites clean of food and trash and hanging your food bag/toiletries at night not only keeps you safe but the bears too. When a bear becomes too accustomed to humans it will approach them more frequently and could have to be relocated or in some cases euthanized. I have been asked if I am going to bring a gun for protection. No. That’s ridiculous. How would you feel if you took a leisurely day hike and passed someone strapped at the hip. Plus let me remind you I’m hiking 2190 miles and a gun is relatively heavy. 
In my opinion the greatest threat I will face is Lyme Disease from deer ticks. My gear will be treated with permethrin every 4-6 weeks and I’ll use bug spray. And check myself every morning and night. That’s about all you can do. 
Why am I doing this?
Over the next half year I will spend my time in the most scenic locations the east cost has to offer. From my experience hiking the sense of accomplishment and views atop mountains are breathtaking and life changing. Hiking is challenging and I think it’s fun. If you haven’t been out hiking recently go do it. If you feel up to it, research a 4000 footer in New Hampshire or New York and climb it. You won’t be disappointed. 
Lastly, my dad told me I should define what success means to me before I leave and I thought that was a really good idea. 
So what does success mean to me? Success to me means more about what happens during the hike than the completion of the AT. Certainly finishing the AT is the goal and will ultimately mean success but being successful is something that will happen during the trip, not only at the end. Success to me is pushing myself to new limits. To taking on challenges I have not faced before and dealing with them in a calm and logical manner. Success to me is keeping a smile on my face even on the days when all it does is rain and I’m cold and sore. Success to me is meeting all kinds of people and sharing the outdoors with them. Success to me is waking up on the side of a mountain and having coffee while I watch the sunrise. Success to me is learning something new everyday and adding to my outdoors skills. But above all, success to me simply means HAVE FUN! 
I look forward to sharing my experience with all of you. Please feel free to share the link to this journal or to reach out with questions or

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586490,"Below is a list of the gear I will be starting out with on my hike. There are hiking outfitters in a lot of the towns the AT passes through so it is relatively easy to replace gear if I have to. I was going to weigh my final pack weight but the scale at home is broken. Too bad. When I weighed my gear a couple weeks ago I was around 15 lbs. I’ve added a few things since then. Food and water will add another 10-15 lbs depending on how much I carry but I’m hoping not to go over 30 lbs.  There might be a scale at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy building at Springer Mountain so if I can I’ll weigh it there.  Also, I think I weigh around 170 lbs.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586575,"Well I’m on my first train from NJ to Washington DC. Then switching trains to Gainesville, Georgia. Should get there by 7:00am Saturday morning. I plan on getting breakfast at Big Bear Cafe around the corner from the train station. Then a 45 min car ride to Amicalola State Park where I will register my thru-hike. The famous archway is supposed to be behind the Appalachian Trail Conservancy building which is where I’ll begin the 8.5 mile approach trail up Springer Mountain. It is not until I make that summit that the AT officially begins. Getting so close now",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Fri",0
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587096,"Day 1 Complete! Went really well. Got to the Amicalola Visitor center around 9, just in time for the orientation by Master Splinter. So one thing I have not mentioned in my journal yet is the concept of trail names.  For those who don’t know, thru-hikers don’t go by their real names. They go by trail names instead. Made-up names that have something to do with the hiker. They are normally given to thru-hikers by other thru-hikers sometime in the beginning of their hike. 
I completed the 8.5 mile approach trail in a little over 4 hours, good pace considering the 2000 foot gain. The AT officially starts atop Springer so I then took the 2.8 mile descent to Stover Creek Shelter. 
The shelter is great. Two levels. Picnic table and bear box. It’s supposed to pour rain tomorrow so hopefully I can hang here and wait some of it out. Dan (no trail name yet) and Steph/Sarah (no trail names yet) who I met at the orientation made it here with me. There is a middle school scout troop here too. Rowdy little boys but fun to be part of the community. I met ELK’s Dad on the approach trail. He made it to the shelter too. His trail name came from his three daughters having the initials E, L, and K. 
Cheddar broccoli pasta side and spam for dinner. I’m starving. 
Today I learned to make my lunch while I eat my breakfast. Much easier than making on the trail.","Amicalola Visitor Center

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587098,"Day 2 is complete. Rained all last night, and most of today. Left the shelter around 11am and hiked 13 miles to Gooch Mountain shelter by 4:30.  Pretty crowded here but nice people. One guy put in a lot of time to build a fire which was great because my boots are soaked. 
Tomorrow is an easier day, only 8 miles to Lance Creek. Going to try and wake up early to get it done before lunch, have the rest of the day to relax. Neels Gap on Tuesday for a resupply, gear shakedown, shower, and bunk. 
Overall I’m feeling good. Some brief aches but nothing serious. It will be colder tomorrow but the sun will be out the rest of the week. 
Today I learned Leuko Tape is a bad idea for blister prevention when your feet are soaking wet from rain. The Leuko Tape was too sticky and the skin on my feet too soft from soaking all day, pulled skin right off.","Stover Creek Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587099,"Cold night last night, 20’s or 30’s but stayed warm and got a good sleep. Up early at 6:00, left camp by 7:30 and hiked a mile before making breakfast at Gooch Gap. 
Easy hike, 8 miles, snow flurries all morning but I enjoyed it. Made it to Lance Creek by 12:30, setup camp with Sarah, Steph, and Dan. Made a fire to stay warm and dry out some of our clothes. The three of them burned holes in their socks. Luckily we’ll be at an outfitter tomorrow. 
Bliss joined us for awhile at our fire. She is tented down the creek a bit. She’s from Arkansas and is section hiking. Really nice woman, her voice truly gives meaning to her trail name. One of those people where you feel calm when they’re talking. 
Today I learned when you are offered a breakfast burrito you accept the breakfast burrito.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Lance Creek,"Apr 16, Mon",8.20
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587100,"So happy to have a nice clear day but was really windy. About 7 mile day, climbed Blood Mountain, the highest elevation in Georgia and got some great views since it was finally a clear day. 
Neels Gap was the end destination and it was great to get here. An oasis on the trail. Mountain Crossing is a full service outfitter. Every piece of gear you could imagine plus a full pantry of hiking food supply. Also a fridge/freezer filled with Gatorade, soda, sandwiches, burritos and pizzas. And a bunkhouse with a shower. It’s Tuesday, last time I showered was last Friday. 
I dropped some gear I didn’t need, sent some home. I sent home my Sawyer Water filter and got AquaTabs instead. Drop one in a liter of water and 30 min later you’re good to go. That saves about half a pound of weight. 
Sara, Steph and Dan (who has now been trail named ‘Nacho’) made it here too but the trail is definitely taking a toll. I’m not sure how much longer we’ll be staying at campsites together which is already bumming me out. But they’re tough, motivated. I can see them getting strong quick. You bond quickly with people on the trail. I’ve known them for four days and I already know I’ll miss them if we split up. The trail can be bitter sweet. But really loving the hiking community. 
I met some hardcore ultralight hikers today. People who are thru-hiking and their packs with food and water weigh around 10-15lbs. One guy was covering 40 miles a day and planned on finishing in 67 days. Got a lot of good info from them. Could chat about hiking gear and strategies all day.
I’m still doing good. My right knee is nipping a bit on the descents but stretching fixes it. Didn’t get much sleep last night because of the cold temperature but I’ll make up for it tonight. 8pm and I’m ready to pass out. ","Lance Creek
",Neel’s Gap,"Apr 17, Tue",7.20
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587180,"Well today has definitely been my favorite day so far. 5th day in I’m sure I’ll say that again. 
Picked up 3 days of food from the outfitter at Neels Gap. Breakfast was amazing. Another burrito, banana, and an avocado. Also a cup of coffee which was amazing. I’ve been getting headaches from caffeine withdrawal so having a cup felt great. 
The weather was amazing. Sunny and warm with some wind. The trail was great, well groomed and climbed a few smaller mountains. But the best part today was the trail magic. Trail magic is any time a hiker is helped in some way, typically other people giving us food and water unexpectedly. When I got to the bottom of Cowrock Mt. to Tesnatee Gap a trail angel (those who provide trail magic) named Roy who is a local of 35 years was hanging out in his pickup truck with cases of bottled water, apples, bananas, and clementines  Amazing! Filled up on water, had some fruit and was on my way to climb Wildcat Mt. Then after coming down Wildcat Mt. just a mile later were Kathy and Mary Hellen with cooked hotdogs and soda! Just amazing. But the really cool part...we get to talking where we’re all from and Mary Hellen grew up in Cranford, New Jersey! The same town I grew up in! Truly a small world we live in. I made sure to get a picture with them. 
It was another 4.5 easy miles to Low Gap Shelter. A lot of people here but so much tent room. With the warm weather I won’t be sleeping with the rain fly so I’ll fall asleep looking at the stars. 
The trail will provide.","Neel’s Gap

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587242,"Nice day, colder and windier than yesterday but the sun stayed out. Views were great. Not a big day, just 7.3 miles of pretty easy hiking. 
Nacho, Sarah, and Steph have decided to head to Hiawassee by shuttle a day early to get some rest and deal with their ailments. They’ll be staying at the Budget Inn through Saturday night. I will be staying on the trail. My friend Melanie is making the trip down to Fontana Dam on May 3rd to hike the smokies with me for three days. I’d like to have a zero day on the 3rd so I need to keep an average of 8-10 miles over the next 13 days which is right where I planned my first two weeks to be. 
I did have a curveball thrown my way with some gear failure last night. There is a leak in my sleeping pad and I can’t find it. Slept on the cold hard ground. You’d be surprised how quickly the ground saps heat from your body. 
Tomorrow will be bigger hike for me, I’ll be getting picked up by shuttle Saturday morning to head to Hiawassee so will need to cover some miles to get to the next shuttle pickup spot. Will meet up with Nacho, Sarah, and Steph then. 
I met someone who has the same birthday and the same age as me today! I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone with an April 29th birthday before. 
Keep staying positive.","Low Gap Shelter
",Blue Mountain Shelter,"Apr 19, Thu",7.30
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587442,"Last night was tough. Second night in a row dealing with a deflated sleeping pad. Tried finding the leak again but couldn’t. Slept in blue mountain shelter. Figured getting off the ground would help save some heat but it was still cold, in the 30’s. Fell asleep around 8pm while the sun was still setting because I was tired from the night before. Woke up at midnight really cold and my only cushion was my foam sitting pad which I wedged under my hip but helped for only a little while. On top of that my left heel has been getting tight over the past few days. The thought of plantar fasciitis got in my head and did some damage to my confidence. Plus knowing today would be a long day I got worried. Tried calming myself back to sleep but was too cold and I was in my own head. 
It got to 3:30, still awake, and I thought about having coffee with the sunrise. I wondered what direction is the open face of the three-walled shelter facing. I reached into my pack’s hip-belt for my compass, turned on the red night lights of my headlamp and positioned the compass. The open side faced east. Score. I kept the thought of coffee during a sunrise in my head. I fell back asleep soon after that. 
Woke back up around 5:30 and began waiting. Around 6:00 I poked my head out of my cocoon and began to see the deep glow of orange creep over the horizon. A silhouette of rolling hills and mountains in the background. Still cold and uncomfortable I’d poke my head out every few minutes to watch the orange slowly turn yellow, and the sky grow blue. By 7:00am I was up and about. Prepping my gear, making breakfast, and that cup of coffee. Success is how I started my day. 
Today was my longest day on the AT. 15.5 miles with about 3500ft of elevation gain and loss. That’s a lot more like my day hikes in The White Mountains of NH. The tightness in my heel didn’t go away but it didn’t get worse. I hiked slow and steady over about 10 hours. I stopped and took some breaks for the sights, ate lunch with Chase and Super Classy. Super Classy is a Samoan woman from California who swore in almost every sentence. But I put in my miles today, I love covering a lot of ground, and I stayed positive. 
I’d like to take an opportunity for some shoutouts because everyone needs help on the AT. First to Steph and Sara. Both offered me their sleeping pads since they were going into Hiawassee with Nacho tonight. I’m sleeping warm and comfy tonight because of them. The second is to the staff at Mountain Crossings outfitter at Neels Gap where I was three nights ago. I tried calling REI to tell them about my pad and order a new one to the motel I’ll be at tomorrow. Waited on customer service for half an hour, never got through. I called Mountain Crossings and told them my situation and they told me they had a clothing only sister store next to my motel. They’ve sent a sleeping pad over there for me which I’ll pick up tomorrow. They get hikers. Lastly is two shoutouts to my dad. First because yesterday at a moments notice I called and asked if he could mail my trail running shoes. I suspect hiking in my bulky boots everyday could be adding to my heel pain. And second for me to write down my definition of success. That will not be the last time I use that tool on this trip.
If you happen to be reading this far down I’d like to point something important out. When I describe my previous night at no point was I in any danger. While I say I am cold, I am fully clothed, cocooned in my sleeping bag (which isn’t rated for very cold weather but I make due) and I am also dry. But most importantly I am surrounded by over a dozen other hikers who even though are strangers would help me in any way had I been in danger of hypothermia. What I am describing is a really really shitty situation. 
I finished my first week. 65 miles in plus the approach Trail. Welcome to the AT.","Blue Mountain Shelter
",Deep Gap Shelter,"Apr 20, Fri",15.50
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587567,"Planned a resupply and rest day in Hiawassee, GA for today. Got picked up by shuttle at 11:00am just had to hike about three and a half miles. It was only me and an older guy getting in the shuttle. I couldn’t believe it but as we were getting into the shuttle a woman came up to us and asked if we were heading into town. We said yes and she handed us each a $15 gift card to Dairy Queen. I was so surprised I didn’t even get her name she just walked away. Trail magic at it’s finest. 1/2 pound burger, fries and large blizzard for lunch. 
Did some chores in town. Picked up the shoes my dad sent, mailed my boots home and mailed my leaking sleeping pad to REI. My new sleeping pad was waiting at the outfitter to pickup. Showered, did laundry, and resupplied on food for a five day trip to Franklin, NC. Everything went smoothly. Kicked back and had a couple beers. Good day. 
Also, slept great last night which was much needed. Should sleep well tonight too since I’m on a bed. 
Rain is on the forecast for the next three days. Should be interesting But tomorrow is special. It’s my last day in Georgia and the completion of my first state! Let’s go! ","Deep Gap Shelter
",Dicks Creek Gap,"Apr 21, Sat",3.60
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587770,"Not too shabby a day of hiking. Weather was crappy. Pretty much hiked in a cloud all day, cold and windy with some rain, but didn’t bother me. Started raining steady around 2:00. Ran into Chase and Super Classy again. Saw them at Deep Gap Shelter a couple days ago too. Hiked with them for awhile until Muskrat Creek Shelter where I stayed and they went on a ways. My pack was on the heavier side because I have 5 days of food in it. After a resupply my food is easily the heaviest item in my pack. 
Another interesting aspect of today’s hike was the artillery training at the Army Ranger training base nearby. Boooom!!!
Overall I felt pretty good today in mind and body. Having a near zero day yesterday plus switching to my trail running sneakers has improved my left heel. Not perfect yet but since my shoes are low cut it’s letting my ankle flex more and naturally stretch the muscles and tendons in my foot. I’m glad my knees are holding up. I’ve seen way too many people wearing knee braces on the trail. 
Weather is supposed to be bad tonight, rain and really high winds. I’ve luckily got a spot in the shelter and we’re packed in here tight. One guy is tenting on the ground within the shelter and another on the dirt floor which isn’t typical and there’s also a tarp being tied to one opening of the common area. Let’s see if holds overnight. Bliss is also here in the shelter with me. She took two days off in Hiawassee because she is ahead on her section hike. Always nice to see a familiar face. 
Accomplishment of the day: I crossed into North Carolina!!! One state down, 13 to go. Weather looks terrible next couple days, pouring rain and high winds.","Dicks Creek Gap
",Muskrat Creek Shelter,"Apr 22, Sun",11.80
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587780,"Well today turned out to be a big day. Unintended though. The weather has been miserable. Rain was on and off yesterday but it was just pouring today. All day. 
The plan was to move from shelter to shelter in bad weather instead of tenting. Every person I’ve passed in the last 12 hours who has tented has flooded. Some people had to shuttle out because their gear was soaked which made it too dangerous to be out here. Planned on a 12.5 mile day but the shelters have been full because a lot of people taking zero days inside the shelters to wait out the 3-day rain storm which I don’t think is the best trail etiquette. I understand trying to wait out rain for a little but if you’re on the trail then hike it, otherwise shelters get clogged which force hikers into tough decisions. Hiked the 12.5 miles but the shelter was full so I could either tent and risk flooding or hike another 9 miles to the next shelter which is a 16 person shelter so higher chance of getting a spot. Decided to put in the miles and it paid off, plenty of room in the shelter. Luckily the trail has been less strenuous in NC. Rocky in some parts but less steep inclines and declines. That will change soon with the Smoky’s approaching. Today was also interesting because I hiked the 21 miles with 3 guys I met back in Hiawassee. Tree Hugger, Short Mile, and Mousetrap. They are a former Army Ranger, Marine, and a Brit in that order.  None of us mind the rain, it just became one of those hilarious days where we ask ourselves “what the hell are we doing out here?” and jokes are cracked all day long.
I’m two days ahead of schedule now in terms of making it to fontana dam on May 2nd. I’m not sure what my plan is for tomorrow. Either hike 7 miles and catch a ride into Franklin, NC and spend the night there. Or push on 3 days about 35 miles to Nantahala Visitor Center where I can also resupply, laundry, etc. Supposed to rain all day tomorrow so I think I’ll decide in the morning. Too tired to make a decision now. I think I’ll just listen to the rain and fall asleep. Oh! Almost forgot. I passed 100 miles today! That’s about 5% done with the AT. Also, Nacho, Sarah, and Steph are back in Hiawassee. I don’t think the rain treated them well. I know Sarah’s rain jacket has not kept up with was needed. Seemed like they made the right choice. Wishing them the best!","Muskrat Creek Shelter
",Long Branch Shelter,"Apr 23, Mon",21.20
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587929,"Day 11! Decided to make my way into Franklin, NC. Being ahead of schedule I wanted to take advantage of drying my clothes and especially my shoes. Tree Hugger and Mousetrap are heading on to Nantahala while Short Mile and I went into town. We knew of a local transportation that was supposed to come by the road crossing we came out to but we didn’t see any type of bus stop. Luckily right as we got down there the shuttle for a local hiker hostel was passing by and picked us up. Not many people would pick up soaking wet hikers covered in mud. 
The driver of the shuttle (which is actually just a Ford Explorer) is the owner of the hostel, Gooder Grove. His name is Zen. He likes to do Tai Chi. I’d like to learn Tai Chi some day just like my grandfather did. Gooder Grove Hostel is really just a house converted into a hostel but has everything we need for the right price. $25 got me and Short Mile our own room and laundry would be done for us with a complimentary closet of loaner clothes to wear while laundry is being done.
We headed into town for a late lunch to the Motor Company Grill which is one of those 60’s diners with the memorabilia and it hit the spot. The best part...hikers get a free ice cream sundae! Are you kidding me?! The locals in towns I’ve talked to down here are generally very nice, but the way people treat hikers is just too good. These are hiker towns with all the amenities. Even when you walk into grocery stores you’ll see a sign for the hiker food section. Easy cook pastas, energy bars, etc. 
We stopped by the Ingles grocery store for some resupply. I already had food for the next couple days so I picked up a box of donuts to share with everyone at the hostel. Short Mile went back to the hostel while I stopped at The Lazy Hiker Brewery for a beer. Everything tastes better when you’re tired and sore from hiking almost 40 miles in the rain the past 3 days. Chatted with Barry and Graham at the brewery. Graham is the head brewer. Just nice people. Happy to have me in town and I’m happy for them being so welcoming. 
Was out at dinner and saw the Celtics game on. It was halftime and they’re playing in Boston so live footage of the traffic on the Zakim Bridge was on. Really made me miss home. But still happy to be where I am and have the opportunity to be hiking this historic trail and see the beauty of the outdoors. More motivation to keep making it up the trail!
Lastly, thank you to everyone writing in the guestbook and giving encouraging wishes!  I sincerely appreciate it! If you ever have any questions please feel free to post them! 
Ok one more thing. North Carolinians sure know how to sing! I won’t forget Karaoke night at Mulligans.","Long Branch Shelter
",Winding Stair Gap,"Apr 24, Tue",7.20
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587999,"Made my way out of Franklin with a local town shuttle that only cost $3 to get back to Winding Stair Gap where I got picked up yesterday. But I made sure to stop at the local breakfast diner and get myself a big breakfast first. Pancakes, eggs, sausage, biscuits n’gravy and a couple cups of coffee. 
Planned an 11 mile day to get back up into the mountains. But my legs and body sure are tired. I haven’t recovered fully after putting in that 20 mile day so early in my trek. Yesterday I only hiked about 7 miles to get to my destination but I think I walked another 3 getting around town to the restaurants, etc. I need to rest which is the plan for tomorrow. 
Rain on the forecast tomorrow and I’ve had my fair share of being soaked so the plan is to wake up early and make it to the next shelter 4.8 miles away. Ideally I can get a spot in the shelter and spend the day laying in my sleeping bag listening to music and chatting with other hikers. But it’s only a 6 person shelter and it’s really crowded where I am now. If I don’t get a spot then I’ll tent. I don’t think the rain will be as bad as a couple days ago. But since I’m ahead of schedule for Fontana Dam my priority is rest and letting my body catch up to miles I’ve been putting in. 
Cool part of the day: When I’m walking around town, and this happened in Hiawassee too, you can see the mountains off in the distance. These looming forests and rolling hills, clouds pillowing over them. That’s where I live now. It took Short Mile and me about 2 hours to hike 4 miles back up to an elevation of 5000 feet and then we get the reverse perspective. Hidden in the forest behind hundreds of trees, looking down at a miniature world.  Id also like to thank Zen and Aubrey on running a great hiker hostel, Gooder Grove.  Such a comfy and welcoming environment.  I wish I got to be there for the bonfires they were talking about!
I try to post pictures with each day but the service I have at campsites is terrible. I usually use half my battery just trying to get one entry to post.","Winding Stair Gap

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588235,"This morning was really beautiful. Some clouds were out but so was the sun and I finally got a few good views now that I’m in North Carolina. But the nice weather was short-lived. 
Got out of camp around 8:30am and hiked the 4.8 miles to the next shelter and got a spot. Started raining lightly around 11:00am and has continued all day and night. Glad to get a few miles in while also staying dry and relaxing for the day. 
For the rest of the day I just listened to music and podcasts and watched the rain come down. 
Tomorrow I’ll hike the approximately 11 miles to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. Seems like a cool place. Will be able to resupply and spend the night in a bunkhouse or cabin. Then I’ll move on about 30 miles to get to Fontana Dam which is where the Smoky’s begin.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588238,"Happy Two Weeks! 
I can’t begin to explain how much of a mood lifter today was. It’s rained every day since Sunday. Most of the time I’ve been in some form of cold and wet. Which is fine. But it wears you down. Woke up to rain this morning too. Packed in a shelter which I’m getting tired of doing. Started hiking a little after 9:00am after the rain stopped and an hour later the skies had cleared and it had finally become a SUNNY DAY!
Not only did it become a nice day but the hiking was a lot of fun. A good chunk of today’s 12 miles was along the spine of several mountains. Steep cliffs to your left and right but constant amazing views. It’s like you’re walking on the edges of two bowls that are side-by-side, deep gaps to your left and right filled with trees only to rise up again on another mountain range off in the distance. The hiking was technical too, rocky, steep at some points. You really need to concentrate while you hike so you have good foot placement, I like that hiking. Reminds me of New Hampshire. 
On top of the nice weather I really took my time. When you’re hiking in the rain all day your thought process is go go go, keep moving, stay warm. But the day can’t last long enough when the weather was as good as it was today. I took some good breaks and took everything in. The picture for this post was one of those breaks. I sat there for 20 minutes, relaxing, eating fig newtons and sipping water. It’s tough to get better than that for a hiker.  
This great day of hiking led up to making it to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. The AT runs straight through it. The NOC is an outdoor hub but mainly for hiking and white water rafting/kayaking. Restaurants, outfitter, cabins, and a beautiful river to watch all day.  Short Mile and I met back up with Tree Hugger and Mousetrap at the NOC. When we split up a few days ago they pushed on but did too many miles too quickly. Both had swollen feet, Mousetrap’s Achilles was swollen too so they took a few zeros here.  We were able to get a 4-person cabin, only $16/person which is a steal.
Tomorrow I’ll be taking my first zero day here at the NOC. I’ve officially finished 2 weeks on the AT. Time flies. If I stick to 8-10 miles days I still have sufficient time to get to Fontana Dam in time for when my friend Melanie is coming down. On top of that the base joint on the second toe of my right foot has swollen up the past couple days from overuse. Not worried about it, it’s a familiar strain from running sports. I’m sure dipping it in the cold river a few times throughout the day tomorrow will help. And maybe a few beers! It will be a Saturday after all. But a zero day will do me good in body and mind.","Cold Spring Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588348,"Really loving this weather! Took a zero today and it was a great day to make that choice. I am still at the NOC and today they are having a big kayaking event. Lots of people, music, and a big river for me to soak my feet in all day. 
Took care of my chores first. Resupplied on food for my hike to Fontana Dam. Not much of a selection but that’s okay. I’ve eaten well the past two days.
Also got my Smoky’s permit printed from the outfitter here. There’s some additional rules for hiking the Great Smoky Mountains but I’ll go over that later. 
There weren’t any bunks left when I tried to book one in the cabins but it wasn’t a problem. I’ve run into so many hikers that I met on the trail and we all found out there were camp spots down the river just a hundred yards so we all set up our tents and made campfires. Good relaxing day. 
I’ll make my way to Fontana Dam over the next few days. It’s about 30 miles from where I am now. No need to rush, will take my time and make sure I’m healthy. I’ve seen a lot of hiking injures so far. It’s actually difficult to find someone who doesn’t have some type of injury or something bothering them.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588421,"Started the final leg to Fontana Dam. Began with a hike of 3,300 feet of elevation gain over 8 miles out of the NOC back into the mountains and with the good weather streak it all went really well. I never mind climbing mountains. Descending is just annoying especially on the knees. But I love the climb. 
And couldn’t ask for a better hike on my birthday! Was able to get a real breakfast from the restaurant at the NOC before I started too. Gotta cherish those meals it’s much better than what I’ll eat tonight. 
My plan was for 8 miles. A mile past Sassafras Gap Shelter. In my time at the NOC I spoke with a hiker going southbound on the AT. He recommend staying on top of Cheoah Bald Mountain. Good camping and great views. I took his recommendation and have gotten the best camp spot so far on my journey. The picture for this post is my tent and its view. 
Soon after setting up camp a middle aged couple set up camp nearby.  They are doing a 3 day hike from the NOC to Fontana Dam. Pretty much exactly what I’m doing but then they’ll go home. Their names are Drew and Hika. New to backpacking and really nice people. I told them about the thru-hike I’m doing and in their questions they asked how old I am. So I told them I had actually just turned 27 today. Shortly after that Drew comes back from his tent with scotch and wine and says we have to celebrate. In the most unpredictable fashion trail magic strikes again. Scotch on my birthday on top of a mountain. How does this stuff happen??
Was able to talk to my family too these past couple days which is always fun. Definitely have to give this a five star birthday.

Even got some trail magic at Stecoah Gap. Apples and bananas. Put that together with some ritz crackers and peanut butter and you have yourself a great hiking lunch! 
Put in 14 miles today so I have an easier hike to Fontana tomorrow. I purposely did not bring much food to cut down on the weight since I planned on eating at Fontana village. Should be able to hike the five miles or so to Fontana and grab a shuttle into the village by lunch.

The Fontana Village shuttle was out for maintenance today so myself and a few other hikers had to walk the 2 miles uphill into the village. Worth it to get lunch though. Chicken Quesadilla and a burger. Gotta get those calories in when I have the chance. 
Spent the rest of the day hanging at the shelter which is called the ‘Fontana Hilton.’  It’s one of the best kept shelters on the AT. I decided to put up my tent but it was still really busy. Probably 20 hikers tented or in the shelter. Good times.","Cable Gap Shelter

Relaxed in the morning after my leisurely hike and then went into the village for lunch and to do laundry. I wanted to get that out of the way so I didn’t have to do it tomorrow when I will have to get to my hotel in Robbinsville. 
It got really crowded around the shelter tonight. It was busy last night but a bubble of hikers came in this evening and there’s probably around 40 people split between the tents and shelter. Everyone will be heading into the Smokys over the next few days. 
I ran into a hiker buddy who I met while ascending Blood Mountain just before Neels Gap on day 4. I had actually heard he was a day behind me thanks to the thru hikers trusty trail name system. There’s only one hiker out here whose name is Strawberry so if you hear that come up in conversation you know exactly who they’re talking about. That stuff happens a lot on the trail. It’s like running into an old friend unexpectedly because whenever you split up with a hiker or a group you never know when or if you’ll see them.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589382,"Got shuttled into Robbinsville today. And by shuttled I mean picked up by a guy in his big pickup truck. Not surprising that’s usually how things work in the hiking community from what I’ve learned on this trip. Shuttle services are usually just people who make a buck helping out hikers. $20 for a 30 minute drive isn’t too bad as long as you don’t do it often. The driver’s name was Steve. Older man maybe 60’s and he has be shuttling AT hikers for 25 years now. He completed his thru-hike two years ago and when the hiking season slows down he leads fly-fishing expeditions. He said he’ll camp about 200 nights of the year. I thought that was awesome. Always get to know somebody when they’re helping you out. You’ll never know what cool thing you’ll learn about them. 
Got into Robbinsville by 1:30 and checked in. Chores to do and Melanie will be coming in late. Probably past 12am because of flights and driving. 
Had lunch and stopped by the post office to create a bounce box. A bounce box is simply a package I’ve sent myself to a post office in a town up the trail. It’s a way to have gear but not carry it. To start I put in my guidebook except the pages I need to get to Hot Springs. Then extra batteries, Aquatabs, nail clippers and the bags to my tent and sleeping pad. Came out to 1.5 lbs I saved. Nifty way to take off weight. 
So about the Smokys. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park. And being a National Park there are a couple more rules. Mainly is everyone is supposed to stay at shelters. No campsites and no stealth spots. If shelters get full there are space for tents near the shelter. If that’s full..well you’re on to the next shelter. Furthermore, thru-hikers and section hikers are treated differently. Section hikers must get a permit stating which shelter they will stay at and which night. This guarantees them a spot in the shelter. The thru-hiker permit grants the hiker 8 days to get through the approximately 70 miles. They do not need to state which shelters but they must still stay at a shelter or camp in the shelter grounds. Ridgerunners walk the trails of the Smokys and to check your permits  
This is all due to the amount of bear activity in the Smoky Mountains. All food and toiletries are strictly hung on bear cables or put in bear boxes. Bears have attacked people, yes, but keeping food away from the sleeping area is the best deterrent. 
The Smoky Mountains also have the highest point of elevation on the Appalachian Trail. Clingman’s Dome at 6,658 ft. 
Overall I am excited for the Smokys. I’ve heard they’re challenging. I’ve also decided not to resupply halfway through. Not in the mood to deal with going into Gatlinburg. Instead I’ll carry 7 days of food. At least I think it’s 7 days. It’s heavy. But I plan on going through in 6 days. There is a hostel a few miles outside the northern border of the park. That’s the destination. This will be my longest leg of the trip so far.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589383,"Well then, started the Smokys and got my butt kicked. Today was just a whirlwind of things in my way. But Melanie and I made it to our destination, Russel Field Shelter, and had a fun time doing it. 
To start, the hiking was strenuous getting out of Fontana Dam and into these mountains. Plus, we planned going to the second shelter on the AT from the southern boundary. Partly because we need to stick to a schedule for Melanie to get to Newfound Gap by Monday but there has also been frequent bear activity at the first shelter and it was not recommended to stay there. 
So the day was about 15 miles and between 4,000 and 5,000 feet of elevation gain. Tough to calculate the exactly amount. On top of that I have what I think would be 6 or 7 days of food to get me through the Smokys but I wouldn’t be surprised if I overpacked on food. It’s at least another 12-15lbs on my pack. The most I’ve carried so far. And then there is my stomach. Haven’t been feeling too great the past couple days. That’s led me to not have an appetite today. All this food and I’m not hungry...And it’s been getting hotter too so I may be dehydrated. I am definitely the most fatigued I’ve been so far on this trip after this hike. A bummer since I had two days off before today. 
So, yeah I got my butt kicked. These days happen. Gotta readjust a few things and keep going that’s the only way to do it. Tomorrow is a 14.9 mile day but less elevation gain. Maybe half of today if I had to guess.  Forecast looks like 50% chance rain. Ideally the rain isn’t bad and it keeps the day cool. 
Oh there were also the flies. The damn flies. If you stopped moving they started swarming. Nothing like it’s been on the rest of the trail. Maybe warmer weather? Maybe the area? Not sure why but gosh those were bothersome. 
Highlight of the day was getting to the top of the fire tower 4 miles in. Just fantastic views. The picture with this post is from there. Off in the distance is Fontana Dam which Mel and I walked over to start our hike today. Really cool walking over a dam! It’s also a very rewarding experience being able to see your progress throughout the day. To see where you started and where you are now. 

Special highlight of the day. I got to see Sara and Steph! They made it to Fontana Shelter yesterday afternoon.  They’re doing awesome.  Didn’t get to see Nacho because he lost his phone and was looking for it. Poor Nacho.  Both Sara and Steph have trail names now.  Sara is Goon Bag because it’s a slang term for a bag of wine which she always carries in her pack and Steph is Forrest as in Forrest Gump because of the knees braces she wears.

Another tough day of hiking but felt better than yesterday. Still a lot of elevation gain and loss. Steep sections. Started off in tough shape too. Stomach really wasn’t feeling well again but I picked up as the day went on. Listened to a lot of music and thankfully it was cooler today than yesterday. And no rain which was on the forecast. I’ll take it!  We do need it to rain soon though because the water sources are becoming meager. 
I still dont feel at 100% with my stomach and digestion all messed. But seems to be getting better. Ate a big dinner and some candy. Staying hydrated. That’s about all I can do while I’m out here. 
Tomorrow Melanie and I will be climbing Clingmans Dome and will reach the highest point of elevation on the AT. A great milestone in addition to crossing mile 200!
Interesting occurrence of the day. We stopped at Derrick Knob Shelter for break and a snack when we saw four horses march into the shelter grounds. We had heard there could be horses on trail because we’ve seen the posts to tie them too. In this case it was because someone had called the park service because they had injured their foot and couldn’t walk. So two park officers and what looked like a guide came up to get him. But he was nowhere to be found. I got the number for their dispatch in case we found out any info. 
Made it to the shelter all battered up. Tough hiking for both of us. But a big plus side to our shelter is a slanted roof with a horizontal cross beam which makes a great way to put your legs up and relax. Oh did I mention the temperature dropped? Yeah it’s pretty cold but not bothering me a bit. 
I haven’t had service at the shelters so I’m adding this part after I fell asleep. Got to experience a pretty intense thunderstorm last night at 5,000 feet of elevation. Started around 1:00AM. It definitely passed right over us. Kept seeing the flashes of lightning which was just cool. Listened to it for awhile but eventually put my headphones and fell back asleep.","Russel Field Shelter

How is it on the days of milestones and good views do I get the bad weather?! No problem. The hiking was much easier today and my stomach is feeling much better. 
Summited Clingmans Dome and crossed Mile 200 today! Mel and I were feeling good and getting our miles in so we decided to change up our plans and head into Gatlinburg, TN for the evening. Mel needed to get into Gatlinburg anyway so she could get a ride to Asheville airport. 
Soon after we made that decision the sun started coming out! And by the time we made it to Newfound Gap it had become a beautiful day. Love how the weather can change like that. We made our way to the parking lot and immediately saw a group a thru-hikers huddled around some Dunkin’ Donuts trail magic. The trail angel was a guy named Sweet Monkey who hiked the AT southbound in 2017 and was down here to hike a section that was closed due to a forest fire during his thru-hike. Sweet Monkey even gave us and some other hikers a ride into town! Perfect. 
Gatlinburg is a lively place. I described it to my sister as Main Street in Magic Kingdom of DisneyWorld. Restaurants and attractions everywhere. Definitely happy I came to see this place. I really enjoy getting to visit all these towns that I haven’t been to before. 
Went to a Texas Roadhouse for a steak and a margarita for our late celebration of cinco de mayo and then stopped by the Smoky Mountain Brewery to try their flight of beers. 
I am really happy Melanie was able to make it down to do this section of the Smokys with me. In usually fashion we had a great time. Great time hiking, faced some challenges and overcame them, saw some great views and not so great ones, met fun people and got to visit a cool town with good food and drinks.

Before I start I need to give Melanie a shoutout that I forgot to give in yesterday’s post. Melanie was my trail angel for buying me dinner in Gatlinburg and it was a steak dinner. Thank you!!!
Got a taxi for the short ride back to Newfound Gap. My driver was Kathy. We talked a lot about the wildlife in the area and how humans have been affecting it. We also talked about the wild hog population in the Smokys which I didn’t know about until yesterday when Mel and I saw a fence along the trail and a sign explaining it was to protect a section of the forest from wild hogs. Apparently in the 1950’s wild hogs were introduced to the forest for be hunted. Wild hogs dig up a lot of plants with their tusks and as their population grew so did the damage. Their are plants in this that do not grow in other areas so the fence along with hunts and used to protect the plants. 
So I am feeling a lot better. Still not sure what made me sick. Bad food, bad water, norovirus, still not sure. But I’m doing better. And weather was great today so it turned out to be a really enjoyable day of hiking. I caught up to the bubble of hikers who left Thursday morning from Fontana Dam. The two nights Melanie and I were at shelters it wasn’t too crowded. The first night we almost filled the shelter and the second night we may have had five. But tonight there must be 30 people at the shelter grounds. Shelter is packed and tents are everywhere. It’s fun being with other people but not sure if I’m a fan of being with such a big bubble. On top of that the next shelter is closed to increased bear activity. So everyone here is either doing 15 miles to the second shelter or 19 to Standing Bear hostel. 
There is a 6 mile section of the AT closed due to a forest fire coming up before Hot Springs, NC. I will need to check once I am out of the Smokys where it is exactly. I’m really hoping it somehow opens up in the next couple days. I don’t think I’ll be too upset but I’m here to hike the AT. I don’t want to leave out 6 miles left behind. We’ll see.","Newfound Gap

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589917,"Got up early today to beat the rush of hikers that would be leaving the shelter this morning. Was probably the 5th or 6th out which was nice, less chance of playing leap frog with varying hiking speeds. 
I decided short into the hike that I wanted to make it to Standing Bear hostel for the night. That put me getting through the Smokys in 5 days which I’m happy with and am generally happy to be finished with them. Increased bear/human activity is clearly a downside but the shelter restrictions and priority to section hikers seemed to cause some disruptions in people’s hike through the park. It’s interesting when you catch up with a big group of hikers. Lots of stories. 
Overall not too difficult for an 18 Mile day. But the knees and feet take a real beating with so much vertical loss. Somewhere around 7,000  feet of loss and only 2,000 feet of gain. Plus the terrain is important. A gradual path isn’t that bad but this is a lot stepping down big rocks or man-made steps to help support the trail. Gravity always works against you. 
Standing Bear Hostel was a really nice place. Just off the trail up a gravel road. There is a house when the owners and I believe the staff would stay. Then a bunkhouse, cabin, and big lawn for tenting with prices ranging $15-$25. I chose to tent. Not a money thing but that bunkhouse has a lot o people in it and I like the cooler temperature outside anyway. The hostel has a resupply room of food with all the main backpacking foods and also a fridge with cold drinks and a freezer with pizzas. Everything on the honor system. When you check-in you’re given a piece of paper. You want some food just write what you take. Also, every half hour or so a staff member would go on a “beer run” which meant they were going to the beer fridge so if you wanted a beer you’d just bring your piece of paper over. Before you leave you’d bring your paper to the front porch and tally up your paper to be checkout out. 
There was also laundry and a shower included in your stay. The showers were unlimited and the laundry was free. You’d have to hand wash your own clothes but there was a working dryer.
Most of the people in yesterday’s bubble made it down which was fun. Hostels are always great places to socialize. 
It’s 33 miles to Hot Springs, NC. The first trail town going northbound and I’m really excited. Not sure if I’ll get there Thursday or Friday. I’ve been putting in some good miles lately and my body is feeling good. Aches and pains and small blisters but that’s not unusual with the constant hiking.

Put in a pretty solid day today to cut down on the miles tomorrow to get more time in town. Hot Spring North Carolina is the first trail town heading North Bound. That means the AT actually goes through the town. I don’t know much about Hot Springs other than it is famous for the naturally heated hot sorry mineral water underneath the town. 
So pretty long day but it went well. Hiked for the day with Strawberry because we hike around the same pace and have similar endurance. It started out with a big climb, 2500 foot gain over 4 miles but it’s always worth it when you get to the top and have great views. The next 9 miles got us to Max Patch which was the summit of a mountain but the summit was flat about about the size of half a football field. Just a big field of grass. 13 miles into the day and we rest here for about an hour. Sun was out with a breeze so we just laid there and refueled. Did some stretching too to keep myself loose. 
As we were leaving, in typical AT magic fashion, we walked into Poet and Hippie Chick. The two are former AT alumni who hiked the trail about 10 years ago. They are now the owners and operators of Shaw’s Hostel in Maine. It is the hostel just before the entrance to the 100 Mile Wilderness. The 100 Mile Wilderness is a section of the AT in northern Maine. It is the most remote section of the AT and considered the most difficult. Strenuous terrain, think rock boulders and roots are the trail, and being 100 miles you need to carry enough food to make the whole trip. 
But it was really nice meeting Poet and Hippie Chick along with their two children. I am really looking forward to Poet’s blueberry pancake breakfast!!!

So made it into town around 12:30, not bad. My legs definitely feeling fatigued from the past week’s trek. 107 miles over the past 7 days.  That’s just above a 15 mile per day average which is what I’d like my overall average to be. I think it’s a good goal but I’m not on a specific time schedule to finish.  
Got into my cabin and settled in. Where I’m staying doesn’t have laundry and I heard the laundromat in town wasn’t any good so I just showered in my hiking clothes. Rubbed them down with soap, rinsed, then hung them on a clothesline made from my cord that I use to hang my food. It’s not a bad option to take. It gets all the sweat out and some of the dirt and some of the smell. They’ll be dirty tomorrow anyway. 
Took a quick nap before my soak in the jacuzzi. My legs were so tired they kept having that spasm you get when you’re falling asleep but not quite there. 
The soak in the hot springs jacuzzi was fantastic. Exactly what a tired hiker needs. I even surprise myself with some of the hiking I’ve been doing but you always need to find time to relax and let your body heal itself from all the wear and tear. 
Made my way down to one of the restaurants and ran into a bunch of people I knew. Good times. I made sure I had a salad with my dinner. Gotta eat those veggies!

I didn’t do any chores yesterday because I wanted to rest and relax. After breakfast I went back to my cabin and packed up my gear. I stopped by the Bluff Mountain Outfitters to pick up new socks. 275 miles on my Injinji’s and they were starting to get thin. Unfortunately the outfitter didn’t have Injinji socks in my size so I went with Smartwool. Always reliable. Now that I’m wearing shorter socks the tan line on my leg is very noticeable where my higher socks were before. 
I resupplied on food next. Dollar General had a lot of cheap options. I still have food left from my resupply for the Smokys which I’ll get through over the next couple days before Erwin, TN. 
Lastly was the post office. I sent cold weather clothes home. My long john thermals pants, gloves, and long buff.

I made it past Spring Mountain Shelter at about 11 miles and heard some people I’ve been hiking with were up ahead so I made my way to Deep Gap. That last 2 miles were the best of the day. Temperature getting cool and the sun setting. The sky grew redder and made the forest look so peaceful. 
Made it to camp at about 8:30. Strawberry, Nameless, Silverback, Pongo, and Mademoiselle were there already hanging out. Good crew. 
Oh that reminds me I do have a trail name now. BlueChip. Multiple groups I’ve hiked with have described me as a well planned and steady hiker so with working in financial services I was compared to a blue chip stock. Not too bad of a name I’ll take it. Sometimes people just call me Ol’ Blue in addition to Just Connor or JC.  ","Hot Springs

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590838,"Ok so I’m writing this post on 5/14 because I’m trying to catch up on posts.
Been putting in some big mile days to help get me closer to Damascus, VA for Trail Days. With the hot weather, 80’s during the day, I’ve been hiking early and taking a long break in the middle of the day. Typically 10 miles by 12:00. Then another 10 miles after 3:00. The hot weather is brutal and can dehydrate you very quickly. Planning when to fill up on water and hydrating yourself between stops is so crucial. I’m going to have my parents send my water filter back to me. I’ll gladly take the weight if it means I can drink water the instant I find a water source. 
To be honest not much comes to mind about this day other than whats above. Again, I’m writing this on 5/14. But I can tell you I hiked. And it was hot. And I crossed mile 300!","Deep Gap

Today was an interesting day in regards to my energy levels. Woke up and just did not want to go hiking. Didn’t sleep well and just couldn’t get motivated. 
But, I got to talk to my Mom! Happy Mother’s Day! Was really happy I was able to get phone service, that’s been tough to get for awhile now. 
Got hungry by 11:45 so sat and ate lunch with a few people. 3 miles later was low on water and still hungry so Pongo, Silverback, and I hung out at Hogback Shelter for an hour or so. Just trying to get out of the heat. Pongo plays the ukulele which always brightens the mood. 
By 3:00pm my energy levels had changed though. The second half of the day I had all my energy back. Love that feeling. 
Got one of the best views of the trip so far too atop Big Bald Mountain. No trees, just grass and rolling hills. A lot like Max Patch a few days ago. The picture with this post is from Big Bald.","Flint Mountain Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590841,"17 miles by 1:00pm. Started a quarter past six so we could all make it to Uncle Johnny’s Hostel at a  reasonable time. A lot of downhill but it wasn’t too steep and the terrain was groomed fairly well. My feet were definitely swollen by the time I made it though.
Luckily the hostel I’m staying at is next to the Nolichucky River! After hiking in the heat this past week a dip in the river was exactly what I needed. Probably 30 hikers down there already by the time the group I’ve been with made it. Hikers will sometimes hang at these spots for a couple days. Pretty easy when you’re carrying a backpack with everything you need to live. But give some hikers a river and you’ll see them all sprawled out in the sun or submerged in the water. 
Strawberry, Nameless, Mademoiselle, and myself split a cabin for the night. Really close quarters but it’s a soft bunk and it has linens! This will be the first time I’ve slept on linens since Franklin. 
Called a shuttle, can’t remember the guys name, but for $7 we would drive up to 4 people 3 miles down the road to Erwin, TN  or over to the Walmart which was a little further. We got a group together and had the shuttle make multiple trips. Dinner at Los Jalapeño, a Mexican restaurant. Strawberry, Silverback, Cheddar, Slacker, Nameless, Charlie,  Mademoiselle, Rockslide, Stretch, and myself. 
Next stop was over to Walmart for resupply and what a sight that is. A bunch of dirty smelly hikers, more than just the group I’m with, walking up and down the aisles seeing what kind of food they’ll bring on the next leg of the trip which we expect to take 3.5 days.  I’ve gotten better at buying the right amount of food. Well, sort of. After a month on the trail and I’m starting to feel the hiker hunger. The never ending craving for food. If I buy too much food...then I just eat it and cut down the weight in my pack. Eat eat eat. I haven’t weighed myself since I began but there’s no way I’ve sustained my weight. 
Back to the hostel to do laundry and shower. Sort out my food from all the boxed packaging. And finally put my feet up to relax by 8:00pm. 17 miles of hiking with a trip into town for a meal and resupply. A productive day. 
There is a lot of rain in the forecast. The coming days should be interesting.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590843,"Wasn’t in a rush to get out of a bed with sheets and a pillow in the morning. Gosh that’s nice. I do feel comfortable when I’m snuggled up in my sleeping bag but darn it sheets are nice. 
The hostel ran a shuttle bus to the Bojangles for breakfast. I stayed back because I had a big donut I got at Walmart the day before. Plus a protein bar, banana, and cup of coffee from the hostel shop made a complete breakfast. 
We’d heard of the storms coming so began preparing ourselves mentally for some rain. We were hoping for space in the shelter 17 miles out but wasn’t sure what we’d get. 
Beginning of the hike started nice maybe just a bit warm and humid. But only took about an hour for the clouds to build up rain start falling. At first wasn’t bad but it quickly turned into a strong thunderstorm. Not a lot of wind but big rain droplets and loud thunder. Not much you can do but put on your rain gear and keep moving. Rockslide put the overheard tarp for his hammock up when it got really bad but you can only stay under there for so long. Gotta hike sometime. 
 I was relieved when we finally made it and with luck there was room in the shelter. No having to put up a tent. And there was a picnic bench under the shelter overhang so that gave us a place to cook. A package of Uncle Ben’s Spanish rice, two packets of tuna, wheat thins and peanut m&ms for dinner. 
Wer’e packed like sardines into the shelter but we are comfortable. Great way to stay warm too with all the body heat. Hoping for better weather tomorrow!","Uncle Johnny’s Hostel

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590847,"Happy Birthday Walter!!!
Second day of rain. No thunderstorms though which was good. Everyone in the shelter packed up around 7:00, preparing for a hike and not sure how long or badly it would rain. If you think getting out of bed in the morning is hard you should try getting out of a warm and dry sleeping bag and into already wet clothes and shoes to make yourself breakfast before you go walk in the rain for a few hours. 
The next shelter was about ten miles away so plan was to make it there for lunch. It went by fairly quickly. Well groomed trail and not much gain/loss we made it in a little over 3 hours. 
After eating we discussed next plans and most of the group decided they were staying there at the shelter but Strawberry and I decided to keep going. We’d like to get to Roan Mountain, TN by Thursday so we could do laundry in a hostel before finding a car ride to Damascus for the Trail Days Festival. 
The second half of the day had a lot more elevation gain than the first half but really didn’t seem like much. Took us 2 more hours than the first half but I still felt good. Sore, a bit tired, and cold/wet, but good. The rain even let up halfway through and we could see the sun lighting up the clouds. I took the opportunity to check if my phone had service and I luckily did. Got to FaceTime with Scott, Arlene, and the boys and was really happy I got through to them. I can’t believe Walter is 2 years old already. 
Strawberry and I planned to make it to Carvers Gap. He has the GutHook App which is another type of AT Guide but can have user added info and is connected through gps. For Carvers Gap it listed a good stealthing campsite for a couple tents. When we got to the site there were already two tents there but no people and it seemed odd. We determined the campsite had been abandoned by whoever was there during yesterday’s torrential thunderstorm. Tent doors on the tent were open, inflated air mattresses inside.  Food laying around the campsite. An opened package of hot dogs and peeled potatoes laying about. Also a table that had a pan on it with a lot of grease built up on it. Sunny D bottles strewn about.  I’d also like to clarify these were not backpackers that did this. The tents were luxury tents, not backpacking tents. There’s a huge difference.  It was just really weird and also dangerous with the food so we kept on the trail up Round Bald. Just a half mile up we found a flat spot around a dozen or so trees so we setup camp. 
Tomorrow we have around 15 miles to the hostel near Roan Mountain. Hopefully it doesn’t rain too much but should be able to do laundry and wear dry clothes again. 
The photo for the day is a little orange lizard. I saw three of these on the trail today. Haven’t seen them one day before.","Cherry Gap Shelter
",Carver’s Gap,"May 16, Wed",21
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590850,"It rained most of the night. I could’ve setup my rain fly a little bit better, the wind kept pushing it into the mesh of my tent. But wasn’t bad only a little water on the inside. 
Strawberry and I got up around 7:00, hiking by 8:00. Both tired. We’ve been on a pretty good push these past couple weeks. My first three weeks I averaged 10 miles a day. The last two, 16 miles a day. A good jump, I’m proud of it. But the wear and tear has caught up. My feet are swollen and blistered.  I am looking forward to two days off for Trail Days. Hopefully I’m not on my feet too much!
In regards to scenery the hiking was pretty great. Since getting out of the Smokys I’ve gone over these large ‘balds.’  Mountains with no trees, only grass. Rolling hills in every direction. Just the most beautiful scenery. 
We stopped at Overmountain Shelter for a rest and a snack. It’s a 20 person shelter which is huge. Most are 6-10 person shelters. This shelter is a converted barn, painted the cliche barn red. I had actually seen this shelter in the documentary ‘Walking Home’ about the Appalachian Trail. It was really cool seeing something in a documentary and then seeing it in real life. 
Finished our hike by 2:30. Not bad for 13 miles but my feet have had it. Swollen and blistered. Strawberry and I hitched the 3 miles into the town Roan Mountain for some food at Highlander BBQ. 
After eating we got picked up by the bar tender at The Station at 19E which is the hostel we’re staying at tonight. And yes, I did  say bartender. This hostel has a craft brew bar in the basement. Yes!!!! A bed with sheets to sleep in and great beer to drink before bed. Shower and laundry included in the price. Love it. 
I also caught up with Short Mile at this hostel. Great to see him again and catch up. So many great stories. 
Oh also an important update. My trail name has morphed. It is now ‘Who.’  A bit unorthodox of a trail name but I am enjoying it. Naming me on the trail has proved a difficulty for my group. It was BlueChip but it just didn’t stick. Didn’t like having to make a comparison to my past career at the bank. As a full progression people have called me Connor, Just Connor, JC, Gutter, BlueChip, Blue, Old Blue, and now Who. The name Who came about because of all these names my group was joking about they didn’t know what to call me. Pongo began singing ‘Who are you’ by The Who. And then Who became my name. So that’s what it is. There are names similar to mine. A young lady in my group is called Nameless. I’ve met a Not Yet earlier on the trail because people would ask him “Do you have a trail name yet?” And he’d say Not Yet. I’ve also met a No Name. But I’ve never heard of a Who before. On top of that I’m a huge Doctor Who fan so the coincidence is a nice.
So, I got to the hostel. Laid out my gear to dry. The vent from the laundry dryer went onto the porch so I laid my tent, rain fly, groundsheet, rain jacket, rain skirt, and pack cover in a heap and let the warm air blow on them. They were soaked. Showered, did laundry, and drank a few beers while talking with the owner of the hostel and its patrons. I am friendly with and have gotten to know Strawberry and Short Mile but for the most part I don’t know any of the people I’m around. One of the best parts of this adventure are the long conversations you have with what are basically strangers. That’s not something that happens in your day to day life and what makes this so much fun. 
Tomorrow I will be finding a car ride to Damascus, VA for the Trail Days Festival. A celebration of hiking by hikers and their families. I’ll make my way back here Sunday and continue on the trail. A much earned two-days off after hiking 230 miles in 14 days.","Carver’s Gap
",The Station at 19E Hostel,"May 17, Thu",12.90
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591468,"Day started a little after 7:00. The plan was to walk down the road a mile to Mountain Harbor Hostel for their famous breakfast. The rest of the group pulled a 24 mile day to catch up to Strawberry and me so they could make it to Trail Days. 
The breakfast did live up to its reputation. Blueberry pancakes, sausage, eggs, home fries, and biscuits n’ gravy. And lots of coffee. Had some time to hang around the hostel too. I’m glad we weren’t having to rush around especially on a day off. 
The shuttle to take the seven of us (I convinced Short Mile to come) left around 10:30. Only an hour drive to Damascus from Roan Mountain. Unfortunately, my stomach full from breakfast and the winding roads plus fast driving led to pretty bad motion sickness. No fun. I usually don’t get motion sickness and that was really uncomfortable. It’s just one thing after the other out here hiking the trail. 
We were dropped off at Tent City. The large field and woods designated as campsite for all the visiting hikers. It reminded me a lot of the the Mysteryland music festival I’ve been to held at the historic Woodstock grounds in New York. Lots and lots of tents. Not everyone here is currently thru-hiking though. People from all years and corners of the hiking community come to stay in the Tent City for Trail Days. 
During the daytime Trail Days is a typical celebration of hiking. Outdoor and hiking vendors everywhere handing out swag and prizes. A lot of the popular gear outfitters are here too and they offer free gear repair. Got a hole in your tent? They’ll patch it up. Tear your shoulder strap? They’ll sew on a new pair. Really great stuff all free of charge. Also a lot of free hiker amenities. Laundry, showers, haircuts. All your typical foods too. Burritos, pizza, pulled pork sandwiches, funnel cakes, etc. Live music to bring it all together. 
The trail brings a special aspect to this celebration. All of the camaraderie that is on the trail comes here too. It helps that Damascus is also a trail town so the AT literally passes through the middle of the town. But it’s easy to hang out and strike up conversations when you’re most likely talking to someone who is currently hiking the AT or has already attempted or completed it. Plus, I saw so many people I know! People I haven’t seen for weeks. Like Nacho! Goon Bag and Forrest unfortunately couldn’t make it up but I still saw a lot of people I’ve seen on the trail which is just cool. 
Around 6:00 in the evening I headed over to the hiker feed being hosted by Poet and Hippie Chick. They’re the owners and operators of Shaw’s Hostel up in Maine who Strawberry and I met when we were hiking down Max Patch. A hiker feed is exactly what it sounds like. Someone cooks a ton of food and feeds the hikers. Tonight’s menu: Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo with Caesar Salad and breadsticks. Amazing. Even a couple coolers of beer on the front porch. I ate with the big group I hiked out of the Smokys with and hung out with at Fontana Dam. Good seeing them all again. Most of them are back in Erwin, TN so about 3 or 4 days back. 
After the feed some of us went to the book tour of Jennifer Pharr Davis’ new book ‘The Pursuit of Endurance.’ Jennifer was once the record holder for the fastest thru-hike of the AT. Really inspiring to hear her talk about her thru hikes and how she ended up setting a record. It really made me want to go hiking...
The rest of the evening is what you can, or maybe you can’t imagine, what a hiker festival turns into at night with a bunch of muddy hikers in the rain. Big bonfires. Dancing around those fires while banging on drums. Just the usual. 
The picture for today’s post is of the hiker feed a little before it started. If you’re reading this and there isn’t a picture it’s because I had trouble loading it. Will add the picture when I get better cell service. 
It’s been raining since Tuesday. Now it’s Friday. Rain in the forecast too. 
P.S. I’m writing this bit a couple days after 5/18 as I proofread before I post. (Yes, I do proofread these. They’re still riddled with grammatical errors but I like to smooth it out so there’s some flow) But I wanted to make a special note to the section when I mentioned how I saw a lot of people I knew from the trail. Since us hikers are on the trail you really do run into each other a lot. The people you’re with do change but you will see people a couple times. I’ve made a habit of learning a person’s trail name if I see them more than once. Because then on that third time it really is so much more enjoyable saying ‘Hey Kiwi!’ Or How’s it going Bugaboo?’  The reason I wanted to make note of this is because it made me think how many people I’ve seen more than once in my life, like on my commute to work, or just in the office, or in a coffee shop, but I never learned their name. I think it’s a good life lesson that if you see someone a few times and there’s even the slightest chance you’ll see them again then just say hi, my name is, what’s yours? I don’t think that type of interaction happens enough nowadays and life is so much better knowing peoples’ names.","The Station at 19E Hostel

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591496,"Day 2 of Trail Days. Started off right with a $5 all you can eat pancake breakfast. Ended up eating 6 of them loaded with butter and syrup plus a few cups of coffee. Great way to start the day. 
There were a lot of events planned for the day so I left the Tent City after breakfast to check out the shoes from all the visiting gear companies and also at the two outfitters in town. My feet have been swelling so I was wondering if it was time to buy a new pair but didn’t get anything yet. I was actually disappointed in the selection from the outfitters. One carried all Altras which are a type of trail running shoe and the other carried only Oboz, more of a hiking shoe. I liked the Oboz because they’re most like my North Face Ultras. But there are a lot more shoes out there that I wish I got to try. My plan is to try the Oboz on again when I pass through town next week to see how they feel again. Shoes are so important I need to make the right decision if I get new ones. 
Next on my list was picking up a bit of resupply food for my trip from Roan Mountain to Hampton from Sunday to Monday. I already had some left over food so only needed a few things. 
After resupplying I relaxed by having my feet washed and massaged by the members of the Baptist Church in town. Really amazing that they do that. The Baptist Church is very active in the hiking community up and down the trail. They’ll even be giving rides back to the trail for hikers on Sunday and Monday. 
Soon after my massage it was time for the parade!  It’s a short parade consisting of different alumni of the trail. Starting from the oldest and ending with the current class of 2018 hikers who are currently on the thru hiking. Everyone walks down Laurel Ave, the main street going through the center of downtown. There aren’t any floats for this parade, just hikers. The fun part though... all the locals of the town line up on the sidewalks with super soakers, buckets of water, and their yard hoses and spray down all the hikers. Just lots fun, everyone having a good time. It’s easy to see where this tradition starting considering how smelly and dirty us hikers are. 
In addition to the parade are a lot more raffles, live music, and talent show! Oh yeah..and hiker prom. It wasn’t much of an actual prom but actually a bunch of guys buying and wearing dresses from the local thrift store. A strange tradition but it makes for a good laugh.
Trail Days keeps us hikers well fed too. One Way Ministries just outside of the Tent City has snack food all day long. They even put out a tub of vanilla ice cream at one point. In addition to the snack food, One Way was giving out free hair cuts. I declined. I think I’m going to go for a really wild look for my Katahdin victory photo. Unkempt hair and a long beard sounds good. Inside the Tent City there were burgers being cooked in the late afternoon. I ate 4. I also had a pulled pork sandwich. The hunger doesn’t go away. 
The rest of the evening was much like the night before with muddy hikers and bonfires. But my mind was elsewhere. Hiking. I’m on day 36 and two days off is great especially to bring down the swelling in my feet but gosh I really want to go hiking tomorrow. The shuttle bus that brought us up from Mountain Harbor Hostel will be coming back to pick us up.
The picture for this day (which I will post when I have better service) is of the beginning of the parade. I jumped in once it got to the 2018 crowd.","Damascus, VA

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591505,"Diner in the morning for breakfast.  Eggs, thick bacon, and biscuits n’ gravy. The shuttle picked us up around 11:00am. On the ride up I had a seat facing sideways which I think gave me the motion sickness. On the way back I got a forward facing seat and didn’t get sick so that was great. 
Back at the hostel a little after 12:00. Moseyed around before hitting the trail by 1:00. Most of the group stayed back for lunch but Short Mile and I wanted to get back on the trail. Plan was second shelter out which was 18.4 miles but we knew there wasn’t going to be a lot of elevation gain/loss. We got to the shelter by 8:30. 7.5 hours for a little over 18 miles is pretty darn good. Ate quickly and settled into the shelter. I’d still rather tent but with it still raining I’m tired of packing up a wet tent. I’ll deal with the mice tonight instead. Even as I start climbing into my sleeping bag I can see them running around the ground and up the picnic table where I was eating only minutes ago. 
Tomorrow we’ll make our way to Boots Off Hostel. It’s on the trail so easy place to get a shower and laundry. Tenting is only $10. And guess what...more rain on the forecast!!!  Thunderstorms should roll in sometime in the afternoon.","The Station at 19E Hostel

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591691,"Didn’t sleep well because of the loud snorer in the Shelter last night. Another downside to the shelters. Camping away from shelters really is the way to go. Hoping for good weather soon so that will be a more comfortable option. 
Today’s hike was almost 15 miles. The first 9 miles were like yesterday. Relatively flat to what I’m normally used to. Short inclines going over hills. Pretty forests.  The final 6 miles were up and over Pond Flats Mountain. 1,500ft up 1,500ft down. And what better than a thunderstorm to throw into the mix? It rolled in just as we started the mountain. Soaking wet by the time we got to the hostel. 
But, if I am going to get caught in the thunderstorm it’s always nice to be able to get to do laundry and have a hot shower afterwards. Short Mile and I split a pizza too before we and the rest of the group got shuttled over to Subway and Dollar General for dinner and resupply. The outdoor shower here was especially cool.  Big metal bucket with a cold water pipe and a hot water pipe. Turn both on and holes in the bucket allow the water through.  Really fun. If I’m lucky to have a house with an outdoor shower I’d love to make it like this. 
Strawberry has hiked on to stick to a schedule he set to make it to Harpers Ferry by the end of June I believe. He’ll then be taking a week off the trail to go to his girlfriend’s brother’s wedding. I hope to see him down the trail sometime in the future!

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591692,"Slept pretty well last night. Short Mile, Nameless, Silverback, Rockslide and myself shared an outdoor shelter at the hostel. Rockslide and Silverback setup their hammocks while the rest of us put up tents to protect from the bugs. 
Breakfast this morning was two frozen chimichangas that I got from the dollar general yesterday. Pretty good actually. The hostel bought two dozen donuts too. Yum yum! Also some coffee!
My first objective for the day was getting to the post office. I didn’t have time to get their yesterday before it closed. The hostel would do a shuttle for $5 but I knew I would take 30 minutes at the post office so I decided to hitch. And just my luck as I’m walking out of the hostel to the main road there was a shuttle from another hostel dropping someone off to slackpack. The shuttle picked me up and dropped me off at the post office a few miles up the road. 
At the post office I had to get my bounce box so I could grab a few more aqua tabs and also clip my nails. What a sight I must have been sitting in the parking lot clipping my finger and toenails. I also had to pick up a package from my parents that had a replacement hip belt that will fit my changing waistline. My Sawyer water filter was also there which I had sent back so I could hydrate more at water sources. 
Then to my luck again as I put on my pack a local drove into the parking lot and asked if I needed a ride. His name was Hippie. Not an avid hiker but has done some sections. His name came from the fact he’s had four hip replacements. My trip to and from the post office took much less time than expected. 
Hippie dropped me off at the trail head. I had heard from Strawberry yesterday when he hiked on that I should take the blue blazed trail down the road instead of the actual AT because of flooding from the lake. It was great advice because there was no way to get through without hiking in knee deep water. 
The rest of the day went smoothly. The hiking was relatively easy, no big climbs or descents. I also made it to the shelter just in time because another thunderstorm rolled in late in the afternoon. ","Boots off Hostel
",Iron Mountain Shelter,"May 22, Tue",15.90
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591753,"Big rainstorm rolled in around 5am waking everyone up. The water droplets making loud pangs against the metal roof of the shelter. I picked my head up to see the headlamps illuminating the tents of those camping in the shelter grounds. The hikers inside their tents making sure no water was getting through. 
The day began wet but stayed mostly dry. Only a brief rainstorm came by. It lasted maybe 10 minutes. I’ve lost count but I think this is 10 days straight with some kind of rain. But I’m staying dry. 
Another day of easy hiking. Not much elevation gain or loss. The group I’ve been hiking with is mostly split up now. A natural progression of the trail. As I mentioned earlier, Strawberry went ahead to stick to a schedule to make it to Harpers Ferry. Rockslide is having a dental issue so he stayed back in Hampton to get it checked out. Silverback, Nameless, and Short Mile have also hiked ahead putting two 20 mile days in because the easier terrain. Short Mile also goes to church every Saturday or Sunday so his hiking schedule usually revolves around that. Mademoiselle and I have stayed on the same hiking schedule. She had been pushing herself to stay with the group leading up to Trail Days but had to cut back because she wasn’t enjoying herself. 
I forget if I have mentioned this concept before, but in the hiking community and especially on thru hikes you’ll hear the phrase “hike your own hike.”  This is hiking concept of paramount importance. Hiking your own hike means making the decisions that are best for you and your enjoyment of whatever hike you are on instead of basing your decisions on what others are doing. Mademoiselle made a decision that left her with less familiar people, but she had a smile on her face these past two evenings when we were done hiking by 5:00pm and had time to relax around camp. I’ll talk more about this concept but I’m happy of the decision Mademoiselle made. 
I was happy to also teach a few of my fellow hikers the PCT method of hanging a food bag in a tree. I’m talking about Pippie, Albie, and Buckles. I won’t explain it here, you can look that up if you want, but it is the recommended method of hanging food so bears cannot get your food. There has been some heightened bear activity around this area the past few days so properly hanging your food is crucial to keeping yourself and the bears safe. In one of my initial posts I mentioned how the precautions used to keep food away from bears is for their safety as well. If they become accustomed to human food they may have to be relocated or euthanized.  On top of that, bears that eat human food have 50% of the lifespan of bears who do not come in contact with our food. Maybe that says something about the food we eat...

Still easy hiking. 10 miles in 3 hours. Straight to the Damascus Bar & Grill to eat a Hawaiian calzone. Next stop was Food City for food resupply and I bought way too much food...again. I guess I’ll just have to eat it to cut down weight. 
The next part of my plan was to stop by the brewery for a beer but unfortunately it didn’t open until 6:00pm and I only wanted to hike through town, not stay here. Having spent two nights in Damascus last weekend for Trail Days I didn’t want to stay a third. However, the brewery was also going to be where I charged my electronics so I had to make another plan. 
I ended up sitting on the porch of the Appalachian Trail Town Inn to charge my electronics and eat some of the food that I had too much of. Yes, I ate an entire calzone and then kept eating food. Oh, I almost forgot to mention. I bought 4 of those baby food squeeze packs. Yes you read that right, baby food. They make them with fruits and veggies so I bought 4 and ate them while I sat in a rocking chair on the porch. Zucchini, Spinach, and banana blend was my favorite. They’re packed with nutrients and are cheap so why not. 
Nearing 6:00pm, Tern and Kelly Still Kelly walked by, seeing me on the porch they yelled “Who, come to the brewery! There’s cornhole!” How could I turn down that offer? I walked over to The Place, a hostel run by the Methodist Church. It’s free but there’s a recommended donation. Got setup there, had a shower, and then Mademoiselle and I headed to the brewery. 
A couple beers, a few games of cornhole, good people, and fantastic weather. I’m not sure what else you can ask for during a Spring evening in Virginia. 
Shoutout to Damascus Brewery for making some darn good beer! Gosh that cherry gose was good!","Abingdon Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592637,"Made my way out of Damascus this morning. But not before stopping at Mojo’s for an iced coffee! It was very warm this morning, sun shining. Mademoiselle, Tern, and Kelly Still Kelly had gone there for breakfast and I already had a hearty meal of pitted dates, cold oatmeal and peanut butter but I wanted iced coffee. I’m pretty sure that’s the first one I’ve had since being on this trip. 
The climb out of Damascus wasn’t bad. Legs felt strong after all this easy terrain since leaving Roan Mountain on Sunday. 15 mile day planned with a shelter around mile 9. Made it there smoothly and rested while I ate lunch. Along the way I ran into a older man maybe in his 60’s named. Nick. No trail name even though he has already triple crowned. A triple crown is if you have hiked the AT, PCT and the CDT. Now he’s hiking the AT again. I chatted with Nick for awhile and he also reaffirmed the heightened bear bear encounters. Nothing violent, some sightings on the trail but mostly bears getting to food bags and backpacks. In talking with other hikers we are surprised with the lack of bear cables at shelters. If I haven’t mentioned it before, bear cables are a simple levy system using a few trees to hang food bags with steel cables. Basically bear proof method of hanging food at shelters. In Georgia and early NC and also in the Smokys there were always cables but there haven’t been any since the Smokys. 
So I’m glad to get the heads up from someone on the trail.  I always hang my food and seem to be pretty good at it. The tough part is being able to find a good tree and then get your cord over the right limb. Unfortunately, I have seen dozens or cords left in trees from people who have gotten theirs stuck by accident. 
On another note, I continue to be surprised and impressed by how quickly weather changes when you’re in the mountains. As I had mentioned earlier in this post that is was sunny out this morning, so hot that I really wanted an ice coffee. But by 2:00pm I was stuck in another rainstorm. Pack cover, rain jacket and rain skirt all on and big rain droplets coming down. Rainstorms are loud too. So many droplets hitting so many leaves. This went on for about an hour before the skies cleared and the sun began peaking through but an hour in that kind of rain drenches everything you wear. 
Made it to the shelter at 4:30. Found a good spot to put up my tent and then made dinner. Ramen with salmon. A protein bar. And some sweet and salty cheezit’s mix with M&M almonds. 
There’s about 4 big flys buzzing around the underside of my rain fly of my tent as I write this post. I’m lucky to say that’s unusual because I haven’t dealt with many bug around my tent. I’m hoping that’s because o treated it with permethrin before I left but it wears off after 6 weeks. Seems like it’s time to reapply.","Damascus, VA
",Lost Mountain Shelter,"May 25, Fri",15.20
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592638,"No rain overnight and nothing in the morning when breaking down camp and having breakfast. Shelter was full last night and a lot tenting, maybe 15-20 people in total.  
Made it an hour into my hike before the rain began to pick up. Nothing serious just a shower but it kept on for awhile. That was until around 11:00am when it let loose. Completely drenched again. Bummer because I put on dry socks this morning too. The rain has been relentless but you slog on regardless. Trudging through puddles and mud. Hiking in clouds makes for bad views too when you make it up high enough to get a look. Good views are a hikers reward for the work they put in climbing the mountain. 
The rain seemed to get worse when I made it to Elk Garden Gap 8 miles into the hike for lunch. It’s a trail head with a parking lot and a bathroom. As is typical with a trail head there was one of those large wooden informational signs and map of the area. This one was about 6 feet wide and 10 feet tall with a little ‘A’ shaped roof. By the time I got there it was almost packed with hikers trying to find any kind of protection from the rain while they ate. There were other thru hikers I recognized and then day hikers and weekend hikers. Lunch for today was a pepperoni and cheddar cheese wrap. Too big to be able to make beforehand so it makes for quite a sight prepping this meal under a tiny haven from the rain. But I’m not the only one. 
The rain today was especially a bummer because I would be hiking through Grayson Highland State Park. It’s supposed to be beautiful. In addition to the park’s beauty it is also famous for the wild ponies that live in the park. Ponies!!!  I’ve seen quite a lot of animals so far on the trail (no bears yet) and I hoped to add ponies to the list. 
And in the usual AT fashion after battering rain for three hours the rain began to let up by 2:00 in the afternoon. The clouds began to part just a I started to enter the southern boundary of Grayson Highlands. The three miles of the park was certainly one of the most unique and beautiful that I’ve experienced on this trip. Rolling green hills but with the large rock formations jutting out of them like miniature mountains. And yes, there were ponies. Grazing in the field that the trail passes directly through. Amazing. 
I made my way to Wise Shelter which was technically still inside the park. A group of hikers had already filled the shelter, others tenting down the trail another 50 yards so I setup my tent in the shelter grounds. Mademoiselle was there too and a few other hikers I recently met. The hikers in the shelter had started a fire so I used that opportunity to dry both pairs of my socks. 
Oh yes, since we were still in the park there were ponies that walked through our camp after we had eaten dinner. Just grazing and walking along. Some of us even pet them! There was one young pony that was especially friendly. 
Overall I’d say this is a well rounded day of what it’s like to be on the Appalachian Trail. Breakfast at a shelter surrounded by other thru hikers. Chatting and joking, getting ready for the day. Then it rains and you get soaking wet. You eat a lot of food all day. And are then left in awe by the beauty of both Mother Earth and Mother Nature. A fire and warm meal to finish out the evening only to then fall asleep in the same tent you were in the night before but now in a different place.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592639,"Another day of rain. Another day of rain! This weather is quite impressive. Mostly light showers during the day but it picked up around 2:00 in the afternoon. 
I’ve gotten into another bubble of hikers for this leg of the trip so Mademoiselle and I planned on staying at a campsite a quarter mile off the trail that was only 2 miles behind a shelter. Most people will go to the shelter. Plus, this campsite had an old picnic table and a disused privy which is not typical. 
There was only one other person with us at the campsite. His name is Jack and he’s from Sweden. He works at an outfitter in the mountains of Sweden giving tours and came out here to the AT so he could get time in the mountains but not for work. 
Since us thru hikers are constantly hungry, food becomes a popular topic. Food we imagine we could be eating. As Mademoiselle, Jack and I sat at the picnic table I asked them if they could have one meal from their home country what would it be. Mademoiselle said bread and cheese. GOOD bread and cheese. I was amused by her French answer. Jack said he wanted pickled herring. Wow, what an answer and at first I was taken back but I have heard of pickled herring being popular in Sweden so I was amused by his answer also . We chatted about that a bit. But then Jack went on about how he’d like to have the pickled herring with roast potatoes, red onions, and sour cream. And then I got hungry. I suppose I’m going to have to try that meal sometime after I’m done with the trail. 
Luckily we were able to setup camp, eat our dinners and hang out food when it wasn’t raining. After we climbed into our tents it poured and poured rain. Tents held up though and stayed dry. ","Wise Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592641,"Easier day today to get to Partnership Shelter. The plan is to head into Marion tomorrow so no rush to get to the shelter. I slept in till 8:00am
Showers on and off most of the day. No pouring rain but still wet. The good thing about today...triple trail magic!
It started with Jerry from a local Baptist Church. I’ve mentioned before they’re very active in giving to the hiking community. I chatted with him for awhile while drinking a root beer and eating crackers. The second trail magic came when I hiked by a man named Sockeye. He hiked from Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry back in 2009. He got sidetracked by pink blazing (chasing a girl on the trail). He actually married her but they’re not married any more. He gave me a beer and some hostess snacks. Nothing like a surprise beer on the trail, it’s wonderful. I was also his first customer of the day. 
I made it to Partnership Shelter around 3:00 and setup my sleeping gear and started to relax. Only a few people here. Cartman, CatDad and Wolfman. Fun people, good conversations. It still amazes me how much fun you can have with people you literally have just met. The third trail magic came when Sockeye left his original trail magic spot and came to the Partnership Shelter which is only a quarter mile from a visitor center of the area. More beer and hostess snacks!!! The trail always provides. 
The shelter was only half full and with a capacity of 16 people we all had plenty of space. We chatted and hung out, I planned out my next few days for getting into Marion and going to the Quarter Inn Hostel. ","A campsite 
",Partnership Shelter,"May 28, Mon",12.30
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592642,"Most of us from the shelter were taking the 8:30am Marion Transit into town. A lot of them planned on getting hotel rooms so they could zero for the day. I however decided I would keep hiking. Too soon for a zero having spent two of them on the 19th and 20th for Trail Days. 
First was breakfast at McDonalds which I was really hungry for. I got their big breakfast which on the menu said it was 800 calories. I probably should have, and could have, gotten two of them. Walmart was next for resupply on food. It was across the street from the McDonalds. As I was leaving Walmart the Marion Transit shuttle was making its rounds so I hopped on and headed to the post office to pick up a poncho my dad sent me. The poncho is big enough to go over me and my pack so it’s more of a complete cover compared to a rain jacket and pack cover. I sent both of those home to exchange the weight. 
A kind lady in the post office recommend Macodo’s (pronounced Mack-uh-dues)for lunch so I went there. Nice sit down restaurant with some fun bar foods. I got chicken Mac n’ cheese with a salad and a Yuengleung. 
After lunch I waited for the shuttle to make its round so I could get back over to the Partnership Shelter 6 miles away. Only a 7 mile hike to Chatfield Shelter. It wasn’t too demanding except the trail was a bunch of fist sized jagged rocks. Some loose and some fixed and pointed out of the ground so you couldn’t help but roll an ankle or step on a pointed rock every now and then. 
Mostly people I haven’t met before at the shelter except a guy named Cottonwood who I met back at the Nantahala Outdoor Center around mile 135. I was getting tired so I just ate my dinner and got ready for bed. 
Tomorrow I’ll hike around 15 miles to the Quarter Way Inn Hostel, a farmhouse from 1910 which Strawberry recommended. Laundry and hot shower.

",Chatfield Shelter,"May 29, Tue",7
Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593687,"Today started out miserable. A real test for my patience. 
Woke up to heavy rain at 6:00am. Too heavy to breakdown my tent without drenching the inside. There was a constant pitter patter of rain drops berating my tent’s rain tarp. I fell back asleep until 8:00, later than I wanted to start, but the rain had eased to just a light shower. I untied my food bag hanging from a tree nearby and hurried back to my tent to eat. 
Soon after I started hiking was when I noticed the trail was much different than yesterday. I mentioned in the previous post how much a nuisance the jagged rocks were jabbing at my feet. But today the trail was all mud. Nothing but 3-4 inch squishy sloppy slippery mud. I couldn’t care less about getting dirty. I’m filthy out here, trust me, and no one cares. The problem with this mud is I couldn’t get any traction to walk. Hiking became an arduous task trying to propel yourself forward but if you gained too much momentum your back foot would give out and you’d slip. This went on for 5 miles.  I did stumble upon a turtle at one point. As I trudged through the mud I noticed a bright yellow and brown shell on the ground planted into the mud. I almost through it was a huge egg before I figured out it was a turtle. It wasn’t moving. I picked up the shell and peaked inside and saw the two slitted nostrils of the shell’s resident. I put it in the grass off to the side of the trail.  
In addition to the mud there were several sections where the trail crossed into large fields of tall grass. 2-3 feet tall and soaked in fresh rain. As I walked down the trail the grass drenched my shorts. 
Lastly was my left eye. I must’ve gotten pollen on my hand when walked through the grass. I rubbed my eye at one point and that’s all it took to have an allergic reaction and my eye swell up and start itching. I took some Claritan but that did little to help. 
I finally made it to route VA 683 and US 11 where there were a couple gas stations. I bought a Vanilla Coke from the Sunoco and sat on the beach outside while I made a salami and cheese sandwich. It was just one of those days. 
The trail after that 5 miles wasn’t as bad. Still some muddy parts but rare enough that it became tolerable. The day began to pick up when I turned the corner of the trail and came face to face to a doe. The doe popped up its head and then turned and bounded into the trees and brush off of the trail. As I was bidding the doe ‘have a good day’ I noticed the fawn on the trail only 10 feet away from me. It was frightened, crouching low to the ground. The poor thing so scared. I talked calmly to it, ushering it to go to its mother and after a minute it slowly got up and walked into the tall grass and brush off to the side of the trail. Happy that it was out of immediate harms way I went along on my hike, the doe intensely watching me from 20 yards away. 
After a long day I was happy to finally make it to the Quarter Way Inn Hostel. Aptly named because shortly before getting to the hostel I passed the 25% mileage marker for the AT. Yes that’s right. I’m a quarter done! 
The hostel is an updated farmhouse. Big lawn with a huge sycamore tree with hammock swings tied to it. It’s run by a woman named Tina and she was the absolute nicest woman. The home was comfy and it felt great to be in a comfy home for a changed. I showered and had my clothes washed. I ate dinner and chatted with the other hikers at the hostel. Lost and Found, V-Dub, Crypto, Jynx, Peter Pan Sasquatch, and Reflex. There is even an extensive VHS collection so we sat down on the couches and chairs and watched The Fugitive with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones while eating pizza and ice cream. 
Overall interesting day. Glad to be sleeping indoors tonight with clean clothes on. Tomorrow I’m going to hike a lot.","Chatfield Shelter

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593689,"At the hostel, Tina has the food system setup like Standing Bear. Honor system. If you take something like pizza, ice cream, snacks, etc you mark it down and she tallies it to add to you bill. However, when you arrive she asks if you’d like to have the breakfast she cooks which costs $12. And hands down that’s the best $12 I’ve spent on the trail. In the guidebook it describes the breakfast as ‘gourmet’ which makes you wonder what it actually is. Queche, bacon, cheese grits, freshly baked biscuits with gravy and nut & spice bread with homemade apple sauce and apple butter and honey from the bee hives that she keeps on property.  There was even enough food for a second helping. 
To be honest, not much happened the rest of the day. Yeah I hiked my biggest day yet. Pretty sure it was, I’d have to go back and check. I plan on meeting back up with Madamoiselle on Sunday at another hostel and this hike to the Jenkins Shelter worked best. I made it into the shelter grounds by 7:00pm and setup my tent and made my dinner. I’m in a whole different grouping of hikers now. I’m ahead of the larger bubble of people I had been seeing the past few weeks. The only people I know ahead of me are Strawberry, Silverback, and Nameless.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593690,"Relatively easy hike to begin the day. The plan for the day was to hike about 11 miles to US Scenic Highway 52 to make my way to Bland, VA. I ordered a new backpack not too long ago that I wanted to try and I think would work well. Same company, ULA, but smaller and lighter. Also very inexpensive compared to other backpacks. I also got a sleeping bag liner, basically a fleece blanket, which I’m going to start using instead of a sleeping bag with synthetic down. Too warm, sweating while I sleep. I could buy an actual warm weather sleeping bag but it would take too much research and too expensive. Easy $50 solution. 
I made it to highway 52 and was able to catch a hitch pretty easily. Two locals and their pickup truck. I hopped in the back which was a lot of fun. Only a 3 mile drive and it was beautiful outside. 
Picked up my backpack and sleeping bag from the post office and then went over to a grill down the road. I ate a cheeseburger, fries, and chili dog with a scoop of strawberry ice cream in a cone. Started walking back to the trail and caught a ride from an older woman named Mary who is also a local. Quick trip in and out of town and only 2 more miles to the shelter where I’ll be staying tonight. 
When I made it to the shelter I was the only one there. Took the opportunity to call my parents because I had cell service. Great chatting with them. More people began to show up at the shelter. 
A lot of new people I’ve met at the shelter tonight. I’m enjoying the new bubble I’ve gotten into. Sun Dog, Spicy Jones, Curls, Cool Papa, Strider, Baby Bird, Brother Bird, and Nick. Nick is the same Nick I mentioned the day I hiked out of Damascus. He is a damn good hiker. Must be in his 60’s but kept up with a lot of younger hikers since I met him leaving Damascus. He has a lot of experience and I’ve seen him every few days so I’ve gotten the opportunity to chat with him. Good sense of humor too. Cool Papa worked at Johnson and Wales University in Providence which is near where I went to school at Bryant University in Smithfield, RI. We reminisced on our favorite local places to go. I love that feeling. Meeting a stranger but able to relate to a similar place.  Gosh I miss Providence. ","Jenkins Shelter

I ate breakfast in my tent and so I could pack my backpack without getting wet. My tent goes in last to the main compartment so I can pack everything else while in my tent. 
The rain stopped shortly after I started hiking and it began to look like a nice day. There was a shelter 10 miles in and I planned to head there for a snack and to dry my gear. 10 miles seems far for a snack but the trail was flat, I was done in 3 hours. When I got to the shelter I met The Engineer and Oatmeal Socks. Father and son who started back on March 15th. 
After the shelter I made my way another 7 miles to a road crossing where a place called Trent’s Grocery was only 0.5 mile down the road. I went down and got a chicken burger and fries with an iced tea. So amazing. Picked up a few food items to hold me ever the next day and then headed back on the trail up 2 miles to Dismall Falls. Dismal Falls is a popular swimming area with a lot of open space and cold river water to swim in. I relaxed with my feet in the water while I rehydrated as well. 
After I had enjoyed myself I got ready to go and started heading back up the 0.3 mile side trail up to the AT when I ran into Madamoiselle. I knew we were somewhere close on the trail but not sure where. I planned on hiking on but I said in my head if I ran into anyone I knew I’d just call it a day.

I had a tough time throwing a successful line to hang mine and Madamoiselle’s food. Got it over one branch but the branch couldn’t hold the weight. I tried another and with the worst luck my rock back hit the branch and wrapped around. Stuck. No way to get it down tugging on it. We found another tree and used Madamoiselle’s cord. 
I didn’t want to lose my cord so I did what what was necessary. I climbed the tree to get it down. Sorry Mom!  It’s was a thin tree, maybe 6 inches in diameter and 20 feet tall. Easy to grip and since it was thin it bent with my weight. It was actually a lot like the boulder style rock climbing I do back home. And I got my cord down! Success in the beginning of the day. 
Short home to get to Woods Hole Hostel. A quaint cabin only half a mile off the trail. And my parents got me a real room! So thankful. I’ll actually be sleeping in a real bed tonight which is just amazing. 
The property for the hostel is beautiful. It’s also a farm so there are vegetables and even some livestock. Madamoiselle and I shared some home baked bread and cheese for dinner.

I left the windows open and could hear the birds chirping and some wind outside but the sun was shining and I could tell it was going to be a nice day. 
Woods Hole B&B is another hostel that does a gourmet breakfast like Quarter Way Inn. Eggs with veggies from the garden, cheese grits, fresh bread with apple butter and a strawberry sauce and freshly squeezed orange juice. 
I left the hostel a quarter past 9:00 and walked the half mile or so up the road back to the trail only to realize I forgot the leftover bread and cheese from dinner last night. I didn’t want it to go to waste so I walked back to get it. 
Ok so probably got back on the trail more like 9:45 but that’s okay. There was a good viewpoint only a couple miles into the hike and since I’ve been deprived on good weather and good views I decided to sit for awhile. According to my guidebook there would be a few more good scenic spots latter on the day’s hike too. I had cell service so I called to my sister to say hi. 
The hike into Pearisburg was very peaceful. Slight breeze but quiet, birds chirping. When I got into town I first headed to the Post Office to pick up my bounce box. I then got rid of my bounce box. The only item I actually needed from there were my nail clippers. I got ride of my quarter torn up guidebook because I just use the one on my phone all the time. And I mailed a lot of my extra AquaTabs home because I’ve mostly been using my filter for water. No reason to keep paying postage on gear I don’t use. 
The next stops were food. First food resupply at Food Lion then meet Madamoiselle at Dairy Queen. I planned on getting only 2 days worth of food but I left with somewhere close to 5. Not the biggest problem. I was going to get more food halfway to Daleville but now I may not. 
After grabbing a burger from DQ I continued to hike another 7 miles to Rice Field Shelter. The shelter is on the edge of the woods with the open hillside in front it stretching out about 50 yards before coming to a cliff. Great spot for a sunset. I setup my tent on the field in front of the shelter then headed toward the front of the field to watch the sunset and chat with other hikers while I ate some of the leftover cheese and bread for dinner. 
It’s getting dark now while I write this. I’m in the big mesh of my tent but the door to the fly is open so I can see out the front of my tent. Only the slightest tint of orange on the horizon.

Overall it was a pretty typical day. I met a guy named Golden Girl or GG who I’ve heard about on the trail. It’s funny hearing other thru hikers talk about people they know when using trail names. You always wonder what the person is like. Same thing when checking the hiker logs at shelters. I got word from Short Mile he’s about 40 miles ahead of me and he met up with Tree Hugger! That’s great news. 
Little bit a trail magic from a fellow thru hiker who is waiting for a friend and in the meantime got some pizza, fruit, and beers. I passed on the pizza, shocking I know, but I had just eaten lunch and was about to make an 1,100 foot climb over 2 miles. I chose a banana and a beer. But the beer I packed out and saved for when I made it to the top. 
I made camp at Wind Rock which is a great viewpoint with a lot of camp spots in the area. My beer was still cold so I was able to enjoy an amazing view with a cold beer. I don’t normally pack out alcohol but when you know there is a good view coming it’s always handy to have at least one beer.

Tonight will actually be my first night camping by myself. Since I go to shelters or popular campsites most of the time there are always other hikers there but tonight I’m in a stealth spot on the side of the trail.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593697,"Late start to the day, got started hiking around 10:00am. Another sunny but cool morning which I’m really enjoying. I ate a quick breakfast and made my way to the next shelter which was only 5 miles away. 
Two good sized climbs planned for the day. The first was a 1,600 foot climb over 3 miles which went smoothly. Shortly after coming to the top of Brush Mountain I came to a side trail which leads to the monument to Audie Murphy, the most decorated World War II soldier. 
Coming down from Brush Mountain was frustrating. Instead of a steady descent it was steep hills where you’d go down 100 feet only to go back up 80 feet over and over again. 
After making it down the mountain I took a long break at a creek to rest, soak my feet, and hydrate. Water has been scarce during this leg of the trip and this would be my last water source for the night. I still had another 6 miles to hike tonight with another 2 in the morning. So I relaxed with my feet in the water and drank two liters of water to hydrate back up. 
The last 6 miles started of really smoothly. Steady incline but I was still able to keep a fast pace. But mile 4 was when it got difficult. I started to lose energy and the terrain became more complex and technical. Jagged rock formations that you had to climb, loose stones all over the trail.  But it was well worth it in the end to come to Dragons Tooth, a stone monolith. Enormous rock formation coming out of the top of the mountain with 360 degree views when you climb to the top. The sun was setting and it was absolutely beautiful. I spent 20 minutes up there, the breeze cooling me down, relaxing. 
It was another 0.8 miles to my camping destination, Lost Spectacles Gap. Getting down from Dragons Tooth was even more technical than going up. There was a lot of rock scrambling but that’s also a lot of fun. Combination hiking and rock climbing. 
I made it to Lost Spectacles Gap without much sunlight so I quickly hung my bear cord and setup my tent and ate a quick dinner. Hung my food in a nearby tree and climbed into my tent just after it had gotten dark. Overall great day. Challenging hiking with great views and beautiful weather. Can’t ask for much more. 
Lastly, I passed mile 700!!!","Viewpoint mile 683.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593698,"Woke up pretty tired. The big climb at the end of the day yesterday seemed to drain my legs of energy. Did some warmups and stretched then hit the trail. 
I ate a small breakfast because my plan was to stop by Catawba Grocery for a breakfast sandwich and a few supplies. Soon after leaving I ran into a guy named Ben who I met a few nights ago camping at Wind Rock. We hiked together till getting road VA 311. 
Until that point my plan was to continue hiking another 10 miles to a shelter leaving only a 10 mile hike into Daleville tomorrow morning but I changed my plans. A mile and a half down the road is a restaurant called The Homeplace. All you can eat restaurant, family style. It doesn’t open until 4:00pm and it was 2:00 so myself and the other hikers were debating how we’d get down there, walk or hitch. That’s when the guy with the motorcycle and sidecar pulled into the parking lot. I seized the opportunity and politely asked the man if he’d mind driving me down the road the one and a half miles. He happily obliged. 
So yes, I climbed into the sidecar and put my backpack between my legs and we drove down the road. I must say it was pretty darn cool riding in the sidecar of a motorcycle . It was nice to get all the wind in my face. The guy’s name was Bill. Really happy I ran in to him. 
The restaurant certainly lived up to its reputation. Fried chicken, roast beef, potatoes, green beans, peas, gravy and apple butter. So so so good. I felt like I was going to explode afterwards. We laid on the lawn for half an hour after eating because we couldn’t move. 
After eating I hiked 4 miles up to McAfee’s Knob. One of the most famous viewpoints on the Appalachian Trail. Truly amazing to get some of these views. 
I found a tick on me for the first time today. Will not be the last. It hadn’t latched on yet, just crawling up my leg but it was a deer tick which are the kind that carry disease. Always need to take extra precautions with ticks.","Lost Spectacles Gap

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594950,"Well today was interesting. Woke up early to get a head start on my hike into Daleville, weather was cool in the morning but started getting hot. 
My day got interesting when I got to a fork in the trail with a sign on a tree that said ‘Shelter’ pointing to the right. This is normal. Sometimes a shelter will be a little bit off the trail so instead of going down the side trail I turned the other way and kept hiking. I saw the vertical rectangular blaze on a tree that marks the AT so I was all set. A little further down the trail I noticed the blaze looked odd, instead of being white it looked off-white, even like faded yellow. I kept hiking. Then I saw a definite yellow blaze instead of the white. I saw a day Hiker and asked him if I was still on the AT and he reassured me I was and that the blaze was yellow because this section of the AT was on private land which was true for a few miles and I knew that. I kept hiking. I hiked 3 miles down the mountain before making it to a parking lot where there were more day hikers. I grew more suspicious of my whereabouts so I asked them and sadly I found out I was not on the AT anymore. 
So...I had hiked 3 miles off trail, down the mountain. I had to hike the 3 miles back up the mountain to get on trail so I added an extra 6 miles to a 15 mile hike. Gosh. What a bummer! But that happens. Luckily as I got back to the fork where I originally lost my way there was another thru hiker who made the same mistake I did and I saved them from making the wrong choice. 
The rest of the day went smoothly. I made it into Daleville and split a hotel room with Madamoiselle. We went to the Kroger’s nearby for food resupply and then went back to the hotel to swim in the pool and order pizza for dinner. 
Tomorrow, Sunday, I’ve decided to take a proper zero. Figured it would be a good time to rest my body.","Campbell Shelter

I hiked a marathon today. 0.7 miles over a marathon actually. I’d like to tell you a crazy story about the day but not much happened other than hiking. I made it to Harrison Ground Spring which is a big tentsite and I ran into a few people I knew including the Australian father and son, YeeYee and Goober.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594957,"Got started hiking around 9:00. No storms over night but there was some light rainfall. I could tell early that it was going to be a hot and humid day. 
My legs felt pretty good after yesterday’s hike which is a good sign. Only the usual tightness and soreness when you first get out of your tent but you loosen up once you get moving. 
The plan was to head to US501 and hitch a ride 6 miles into Glasgow, VA for a food resupply. I hiked relatively slowly, my legs not able to fully recover but that was expected. I made it to the road by 2:00pm and tried to hitch but didn’t get anything for an hour which isn’t typical. A young lady named Megan picked me up in her van which she converted into a room and was living out of. That may seem very strange out of context but she seemed to have her life together but was just the free spirited type. Her cousin and golden retriever were there too. And thanks to them I got a ride into town. 
First to the express grocery store for 3 or so days of food to get me to Waynesboro. Then over to Scotto’s Pizza and Sub shop for a late lunch. It was there I decided to shorten my hike for the day down by 8 miles. I didn’t have the energy and it was too late in the day. So I relaxed and ate and made a new schedule for the next few days. 
Getting back to the trail was simple. Got a hitch from man named Mike who was part of a church group in town that does hiker feeds every Monday. 
It had been nice for the whole day. In typical AT fashion, as I hiked past a sign that said 0.6 miles to the shelter, it poured rain. Thankfully I was quick and threw my poncho over myself and my pack just as it started to pour. I was even listening to an audio book at the time but I could hear the rainstorm rushing in from the sound of the leaves. It’s almost comical. Hiker hikes all day, blue sky and clouds. Makes it within half mile of destination and it’s pours rain. 
Lucky for me the cool part of my day was at that shelter. I met Summer and Mike, Team #11 of LL Bean’s relay hike. Over 40 teams from LL Bean are section hiking the AT and will be completing it relay style. Super cool! The photo for this post is the bridge going over James River, just before I hitched into Glasgow.","Harrison Ground Spring

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594958,"The destination for today was the meadow at the summit of Cole Mountain per the recommendation from Summer, half of the LL Bean AT Relay Team who I met last night. It was only a mile past where I originally planned on camping. 
The hike getting there though was quite challenging but having only hiked 13 miles the day before I felt rested. From what I can calculate there was about 8,500 feet of elevation gain and 6,000 feet of loss. Pretty gnarly actually. I am quite impressed by how much of a stronger hiker I am now. 
Cool part of day. When atop Cole Mountain, I was laying in the meadow taking in the view. Looking out I could see miles and miles ahead of me. Some rolling hills and mountains. As I looked into the distance I saw what I thought was a plane. But it was level with me, same elevation which was 4,000 feet. Which was very strange because planes don’t fly that low. Not even close. The plane was black and was making no sounds as it darted across the landscape. I sat there puzzled with what I was looking at when the sound caught up with the plane which I now figured was a military jet. A second followed. Really really cool. 
Lastly, Happy 2 Months!! It’s hard to believe I’ve been living outdoors for two months now but it’s true.

Today’s hike was mostly along a ridge of mountains. Having climbed to high elevation yesterday there weren’t any big climbs today. Only a very big descent of around 3,000 feet near the end of the day. 
I ran into Madamoiselle having finally caught up with her since leaving Daleville on Sunday. One of her shins is swollen so she is slowing down and will be taking a few days off after making it to Waynesboro on Sunday. 
My day ended by making it to Harpers Creek. Big creek with a watering hole. I wish I had more time because I would’ve taken a dip but still had to feed myself and do my other nightly chores. There are a lot of people here. Not at thru hikers, some weekend hikers. There are a lot of tent sites. 
I am looking forward to Waynesboro on Sunday. I should be able to get into town early and do my chores; laundry and resupply. I then plan on going to the Chinese food buffet. There have been a few of these buffets in towns along the trail and us thru hikers talk about them a lot. I haven’t been to one yet so I’m thoroughly excited.

I was awake around 5:30, got my food bag from the nearby tree and ate some food then laid back down for awhile and caught up on some journal entries I had fallen behind on. 
Was hiking by 7:30 with 22 miles planned for the day. Another beautiful weather day. Blue skies and not too hot. Only downside is my body is definitely tired. Had a lot of big days this week which takes some getting used to. It was difficult to stay concentrated and took more breaks than usual. 
Summer is right around the corner and it’s definitely hiking season. It’s usually hard for me to remember the day of the week which doesn’t surprise me but it was easy to tell today was Saturday. So many day and weekend hikers out on the morning mountains. The tenting grounds at the shelter are packed.

Just a 5 mile hike to US 511 to get a hitch into Waynesboro. The road wasn’t very hitchable so I tried calling a list of trail angels who give rides but no one picked up. I don’t blame them since it was Sunday morning and Father’s Day. 
Luckily a nice lady name Anne saw me and pulled over and drove me to Stanimals Hostel. A past thru hiker who converted a house into a hostel. Very comfy. 
I was starving by the time I made it to the hostel so I showered quickly and put on some loaner clothes so I could head down to the Chinese buffet. My first buffet since being on trail. I ate 5 full plates of food, including lots of veggies and then two full plates of dessert. Wow. And ouch. I think it’s safe to say it was the most food I had ever eaten. 
I called my Dad and brother while I walked to the hostel from the buffet. My brothers family and my sister drove down to my parents for the weekend. Glad I got to talk to them. 
I did laundry when I got back and relaxed with my feet up.

Hiking through Virginia has gotten tough. Time has seemed to drag on and keeping motivated has been difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘Virginia Blues’ since the state is 500 miles long of hiking which is about 25% of the AT. 
I got started hiking around 10:30. Silverback and Nameless were still staying at their friends house so my plan was to meet up with them tonight. I started hiking with some new thru hikers I met at the hostel last night; AZ, Finger Lickin, and Tracks. 
The hiking was not very strenuous which was great. Big change to how it’s been lately. I made it to the shelter around 6:30 and it sure was packed. So many section hikers in addition to thru hikers who I’ve ever met.

7 miles to the Loft Mountain Campground Store to pickup a few things I forgot while I was in Waynesboro. And also a soda. I wished it was a slushee but it was still good. 
I hiked another three miles to a viewpoint for lunch. Still breezy which felt great compared to yesterday. 
The second half of the day went relatively smoothly. Still easy hiking but started to get hot and humid. I did however see a buck for the first time on the trail. It was young only a few small antlers about 6 inches long. Really cool. 
I got to within 2 miles of the shelter before a quick thunderstorm rolled through with pouring rain. But luckily it ended quickly. 
Made it to the shelter by 6:30. A good amount of thru hikers here and some new ones, Doc and Hummingbird, who I haven’t met before. 
I’ll be staying in the shelter tonight. Second day in a row.  I don’t think I’ve stayed two night in a row in a shelter since it was required in the Great Smoky Mountain. There aren’t any rules like that here in the Shenandoah. It’s actually encouraged to stealth camp here in the Shenandoah to spread out the impact of camping instead of putting a lot of stress in certain areas.

I hiked with Nameless and Silverback to Lewis Mountain Campground which was about 11 miles away. Nice day and easy hiking. I’m certainly enjoying the terrain and the trail isn’t very steep. 
When we got to the campground for lunch we ran into Doc and Hummingbird who recommended the Area 51 Wild Wolf Blackberry Sour Ale from the camp store up the road. That sounded way too good and we were ahead of schedule so we got a 6 pack and had a long lunch. 
We also saw Jingles at the store too. I’m not sure if I’ve ever mentioned Jingles. But he rented a cabin for the night at the Big Meadows Lodge and invited the three of us to stay there and we were eager to take up his offer. We knew rain was on the forecast. 
And just in time we made it to Big Meadows and to the lodge just as it started to rain. Small cabin, one bed, but perfect for four hikers to spread out on the floor and stay out of the rain. 
One of the nice things about the Shenandoah are all these lodges and waysides that have restaurants and stores. At Big Meadows, Namesless, Silverback and I were able to go the the restaurant and get a good meal before heading to the taproom that is also there. AZ, Tracks, and Finger Lickin were already down there. Good night of hanging out, drinking beer, and most importantly...staying out of the rain.","Hightop Hut

We got an early start on the day so we could make it to Thornton Gap 17 miles away to be picked up by Alison who owns the Open Arms Hostel in Luray, VA. 
Pretty smooth hiking still in the Shenandoah. Clouds roll in and out but no rain by lunch. The first stop was Skyland Resort and Restaurant, another set of lodges and cabins for tourists and hikers. 
But there was something special about hiking here. When about a 1/3 of a mile away from the resort I heard and crack of a branch and a rustling of leaves up to my left. I looked up to see a bear cub bustling about 30 feet away, quickly followed by another two cubs and their mother. Bears!! Finally!! I had been hoping to see bears. Silverback, Nameless and I stopped hiking to check out the situation. The bears were near the trail so I clacked my poles together to let them know we were there. We took some pictures and kept hiking. Mama bear kept an eye on us while we hiked the trail which bent around them. Totally awesome. 
We had lunch sitting on some rocks outside Skyland Resort. I had a coffee too. More clouds rolling in and we knew the forecast was going to get bad so we kept hiking soon after eating. 
We made it to the Gap just at 3:30 and were picked up by Alison. The rain began to pick up. We stopped by the gear outfitter first because Silverback is having trouble with her shoes. Then onto the hostel which is Alison’s House. Very comfy. Familiar faces there too! AZ, Tracks, Finger Lickin, and Short Legs. 
A few of us ordered delivery from the Italian restaurant which was delicious. Big plate of pasta and a gyro. So good!

I was shuttled back to the trail with Nameless, Silverback, Short Legs, and Stephan. Pouring rain as we got out of the van on the side of the road and hurried onto the trail under the canopy of trees for cover. 
We hiked around 9 miles to Eklwallow Wayside to rest and eat lunch. There was a small grill inside so I got a grilled ham and cheese. A grilled ham and cheese is a great idea when you’ve been hiking hours in the rain. That was followed up by two cups of hot black coffee. 
Gravel Spring Hut was only 5 miles away from the wayside and made it there by 4:30 which was nice. So much rain though. There was a small lull which I took advantage of to setup my tent because the shelter was packed. There were enough tent sites nearby for Silverback, E Street, Nameless, and Short Legs to setup too so we could hangout. 
While we were eating dinner, E Street spotted a bear walking into camp. Only a few yards from a guy and his hammock/tarp who was about 30 yards from us. In that situation you want to scare the bear off. Yell, clap, throw rocks, which is what we did. We alerted the guy in the hammock who helped scare the bear off too. It came back a few times and we had to repeat the process. It was a mama bear and we could see some cubs climbing up a tree on the distance. 
I saw another bear earlier today too. A cub which was halfway up a tree only about 10 feet off the trail. I heard some movement and turned my head and there it was. No mama bear which was slightly concerning but I just kept moving and clacking my trekking poles. Bear density is probably highest in the Shenandoah. I’m glad to have gotten some experience dealing with them. 
It has been raining for about 24 hours now. Hopefully tomorrow it will let up but I will be heading into Fort Royal, VA with Nameless and Silverback regardless. Nameless did half the AT last year going southbound. This year she did the other half northbound.

So that means celebration! The successful finish of a thru hike is quite the accomplishment so Nameless, Silverback, E Street, Short Legs and myself will be heading into town for some fun. 
We got into town around midday and split s hotel room together. Cramped but we don’t care. We laid out all of our completely soaked gear on the railings of the hotel. That rain last night completely drenched each one of us. 
After we dried our gear and took showers we headed downtown for a quick stop at the gear outfitter. I needed blister treatment stuff. The rain has done a lot of damage to my feet. 
Then we did a wine tasting! $5 for 6 different wines. That was great. 
As we were leaving the tasting we ran into AZ, Finger Lickin, Tracks, and Doc who had zeroed in town and were coming out of the movie theater. We all headed over to The PaveMint a absolutely fantastic bar and grill. Such good beer! We got a big table and continued the celebration.

Afterwards, I headed over to the Dollar General for food resupply and then chatted with my mom on the phone. 
Packed up all of my gear nearing lunchtime and then went to Taco Bell with Silverback, Nameless, Short Legs, and E Street. Quick lunch before Nameless had to leave for her bus and the rest of us got a Lyft back to the trail head. 
The trail is practically a muddy river now from all the rain. My dry socks were soon wet again. And the thunderstorm that quickly moved in didn’t help either. This went on for 8 miles. 
Shortly after the rain stopped there was some trail magic which was so amazing. A big thank you to Summer Camp who thru hiked last year and drove to the trail from DC to set up the trail magic. All kinds of drinks, hot dogs, veggies, chips, and candy. A great pick-me-up after getting drenched in the rain. 
Another 8 miles to finish up the day. My feet not enjoying being soaking wet all day. The four of us found a good tenting site just off the trail with plenty of space for all of us to setup camp.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596002,"Today started with a new challenge: slugs. It’s always something new on the AT and this time slugs had crawled all over our tents and shoes overnight. Short Legs, E Street, Silverback and I had to pull dozens off of our gear. They left an orange slime wherever they crawled. 
Very pretty and calm morning. Finally no rain on the horizon. I got started hiking around 8:30 but felt myself moving slow. I hiked 8 miles by almost 12:00 and stopped for lunch at a shelter. Tortillas and tuna for lunch. I’ve gotten more used to eating tuna which I guess is a positive. Short Legs and I ate lunch with IBTAT. He’s another thru hiker and has a popular YouTube channel and Instagram account. You can easily find him online. We chatted for awhile before I kept hiking and entered The Roller Coaster. 
The Roller Coaster is a 13.5 mile section of the trail and it is named that for the ‘tightly packed ascents and descents’ as described in the guidebook. It’s typically described as a difficult section but I didn’t find it that challenging. Getting energy in the morning was tougher. A big lunch helped. 
What also helped was trail magic!!! In the middle of The Roller Coaster was a big trail magic setup. Cheeseburgers, snacks, sodas and beers. Perfect place to take a break. Big thanks to Walkman and his family  
2 miles after the trail magic I passed mile 1,000. What an amazing feeling that was. 1,000 miles of hiking, what an accomplishment. 
Short Legs and I hiked another 10 miles or so to a campsite by a stream where we met back up with Silverback and E Street. We didn’t plan on meeting here it just happened like that. Not a big surprise, hikers like to camp near a water source but it’s fun how we don’t even plan with each other where our destination is we just end up meeting at the same place by coincidence.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596003,"Harpers Ferry! What an exciting day today! Harpers Ferry is the unofficial halfway point for the AT. Sometimes referred to as the emotional or psychological halfway point because it’s so close to the actual halfway point by mileage and is where the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters is located. 
I made it into town around 2:00 and headed to the headquarters. Thru hikers stop here to have their photo taken in front of the building so their progress can be logged by the ATC. There are binders upon binders here logging all the hikers who have made it to this point on the trail. So cool! 
Today was also special because guess who I ran into? Strawberry! He’s back from his week off for a wedding he had to go to. I though he was coming back tomorrow but there he was at the ATC! So happy to see him. He was excited to see me and gave me a hug without thinking of the consequences of hugging a drenched hiker who hasn’t showered lately. Funny stuff. 
We went out for food shortly after. I got a huge pizza and ate most of it. My last two slices I got in a to-go box. We walked around Harpers Ferry which is a beautiful town on the Potomac River. I wish we had more time to go to more of the restaurants. 
As it was getting late, my current crew plus Strawberry started walking down the tow path that was parallel to the Potomac in search of a campsite which we found.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596026,"If you’re wondering if that mileage for the day is correct then let me clarify. Yes, it is correct. 
After I starting hitting consistent 20 mile days I knew I wanted to hit 40 miles in one day. Today was that day. Silverback and I set out at 4:00am, still in the dark, for a 40 mile day to hike through the entire Maryland section of the AT. 
I woke up at 3:00am and ate the remaining two slices of pizza to yesterday’s dinner and 4 packets of cold soaked oatmeal. Had to load up on calories for a big day. 
Overall the day went smoothly. Not the most difficult of hiking which played into our decision to hike this particular 40 miles. By 11:45am we had hiked 20 miles and were halfway done. It had started to rain pretty hard and we just made it to a shelter when it poured. 
We took an hour break for lunch. Loading up on a lot of food so we’d have the energy to hike what would be normally another day of hiking on top of the mileage we’d already hiked. 
The rain held off for the afternoon which was really lucky and we stayed focused on putting in the miles. It’s strange how each day you setup your mind for how difficult the day is going to be. The more difficult you expect it to be the less you’ll feel like you’re suffering because it’s what you expected. I’ve had days where I’ll be hiking around fifteen miles or less and my feet and muscles will be killing me because I’d expected it to be an easy day when it turned out it wasn’t. 
By 7:30pm Silverback and I crossed the Mason-Dixon Line which is the border  between Maryland and Pennsylvania. I had been in Virginia for weeks and here I am passed West Virginia and Maryland entering Pennsylvania. The rejuvenating effect this has is staggering. Virginia, although beautiful and rewarding, dragged on and felt like it was impeding progress even though I was putting in miles. But now I’m in a northern state. It’s almost difficult to comprehend the distance I’ve traveled north but here I am. 
Another 3/4 of a mile or so and we made it to the Falls Creek Campsite at 8:00pm. Just over 40 miles of hiking from where we started and 16 hours later. My feet were throbbing by the time we finished but we had succeeded.

Connor Koellner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600170,"Hello readers! I apologize for dropping off for awhile and not updating my trail journal. My willpower To write diminished after that 40 mile day along with the many miles a day I was hiking after that. But you may be happy to know that all is well and I am still hiking!I unfortunately do not have daily entries for the time I’ve missed so what I plan on doing is updating the daily mileage which I have saved and then giving an entry to summarize my experience in each state to catch up. In the future I will do my best to write a post every few days. Even though I did enjoy my previous writing style it did become cumbersome to describe each day in the manner I was doing while also hiking 20+ mile days and getting into camp late at night. Regardless, thank you for taking the time to read. I will be writing and posting updates soon so go back to June 28th to begin checking my daily miles and periodic posts to catch up to where I am now. ","Greenwall Shelter
