Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582972,About 30 years ago I read a 2 volume set of books called “Hiking the Appalatian trail” . It was basically a collection of thru hiker journals from Earl Shaffer and Grandma Gatewood to thru hikes done in the 70’s. The idea really appealed to me ever since. I retired from UPS 2 years ago and have gradually come around to the idea of actually doing this thing.The past few months I’ve been gathering gear and watching a slew of advice videos. My sister generously volunteered to drop me off at Springer on her way to Florida. My tentative start date is Feb 27th. Yikes 13 days away!,"

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583093,Last night we had a family dinner to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. Also sort of a farewell to me before I hit the trail. I’ve dreamed about this trip for so long it’s funny now I think about how much I’ll miss everybody. My son gave me a short haircut I’ll definitely need a warm hat.     Tonight I’ve set my tent up in the back yard and will test out how I sleep. I know l should have done a shakedown backpack but never could get that done. I have done a lot of walking and hiking but very little camping practice. I think in Georgia I’ll still have a lot to learn.,,View Entry,"Feb 19, Mon",0
Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583283,"Tonight we are camping at Kings Mountain State Park in North Carolina. Tomorrow, hopefully we'll arrive at Amicalola Falls. My sister and I are driving her brand new camper and this is it's first night of use. My wife also came to see me off. The weather right now is perfect I hope for some like this on the trail.
      Monday I start, so excited!  Many thanks to family and friends for their support.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Sat",0
Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583336,We arrived at Amicalola Falls at around 4:30 and drove straight up to the Campground. Whew that road was steep pulling a camper up. Asked at the lodge about checking in for my thru hike. They said to do that at the visitors center  at the bottom of the hill that closed at 5. Oh well I'll have to do that tomorrow. Right now we're having dinner and listening to a light rain pattering down. Tomorrow I'm out in it.,,View Entry,"Feb 25, Sun",0
Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584611,"Day one on the trail. We drove down to the visitors center and I registered as thru hiker 369. We  then drove up the Springer mountain fire road picking up 3 girls from Florida on the way. They were glad not to have to walk that 6 miles. After parking Jennifer, Toni, and I walked the mile to the top. Took pictures at the plaque. Then back to parking lot. The hugs goodbye and I set off.","Springer Mtn

  Got up around 7 but didn't get going until 9:45. Got to get better at packing.

  Today went pretty well. I climbed 2 mountains Blue and Tray and am now at Tray mtn shelter. I think I will push on. It's still early and I want to get some more miles in before the rain sets in tonight.","Blue mtn shelter

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583696,"Hiking well yesterday. Continued 2 miles past Tray shelter. Stealth camped for the first time. Quite an experience all alone in the woods. Owls hooting occasionally.
  Rain started during the night but was light enough to get the tent down without getting to much soaked. The rain picked up while walking and soon I was soaked and cold. Kept walking to stay warm. Finally made it to Top of Georgia hostel. Now I'm in scrubs while they do my laundry. Finally warm and dry. Might catch the shuttle into Hiawasse at 4pm.
  A funny thing happened on the last part of the hike today, as my feet got soaking wet, foam started coming out of my left shoe. I would occasionally wipe it off with leaves but it would keep coming back and grew to the size of a baseball. When i slogged up to Top of Georgia Hostel, other hikers saw this foam, and wanted to give me the trail name of ‘Foam Foot’. Quite a few people know me as Stacker so I think I’ll stick with that.","Stealth 2 miles past Tray shelter

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583872,"Here’s a summary of the last few days: I caught the 9:00 shuttle from Top of Georgia back to the trail. The weather had turned much colder overnight. Cold weather made for nice hiking. I made 11.9 miles to Muskrat creek shelter. As soon as it got dark everyone turned in. The temps. dropped to the low teens and it was a long night in the sleeping bag.
  The next day was a climb up Standing Indian mountain. Snow on the ground made the climb slippery but I made it Ok. Ice balls collected on the tips of my trecking poles that I had to hammer off with a rock. I stealth camped in Beech gap a hike of 9 miles.
  After another cold night I went to find my bear bag and spent 10 minutes looking in vain. Turns out I had walked the wrong way.
  That day I climbed Albert mtn. The path was dramatic clinging to the tops of cliffs then a challenging scramble to the fire tower at the top. The view was fabulous. Mountains rolling off seemingly forever. Spent the night at Long Branch shelter. The night was not as cold no frozen water bottles.
  Today I got up early and did 7 quick miles over 2 smaller mountains to catch the 11:00 shuttle into the town of Franklin. I'm staying at Goody hostel. Rain is predicted so I'll take a zero day tomorrow. These constant mountains are wiping me out. I just weighed myself. I've lost 15 pounds. When I put my shorts on I have to hold them up.","

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583963,"I spent a zero day in Franklin. It was supposed to be raining but didn't. Well at least I'm well rested. I walked into town around midday but it being Sunday most everything was closed. But the Currahee brewery was open and I spent a pleasant hour or so sampling beer and talking to a few locals.
  The last week of hiking I've run into a young guy named Josh from New Jersey. He strides along in a serene way passing me not needing hiking poles. Then he lingers in camp late or sometimes hikes at night seemingly enjoying that. He's staying here also and I watched him make a breakfast of a bag of Broccoli, 6 eggs, and a can of black beans. It made quite a heap.
  Tomorrow I get going. Looks like it will be light rain turning into snow. 
   By the way my total miles so far are 109.","Gooder Grove hostel

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584003,"Today Zin took me back to the AT. When we got to the trailhead he showed me and 2 other hikers some Tai chi. Maybe I can use it on this hike.
  Got going around 9 climbing with a heavy pack. I regretted buying that 16 oz. summer sausage, ate about 1/4 for lunch as a light snow started. Climbed Siler Bald then descended into sun.
  Next came Wayah Bald and into heavyer snow. It was sticking to all the trees and was quite beautiful. At the top was a stone tower and as I walked up to it the clouds racing along started to lift. I was treated to a dazzling view. White trees descending away and all the mountains stretching out to the distance. I whooped for the shear joy of it.
  Tonight I'm camped at Licking Gap. AT.  mile 121.5. It's gonna be another cold night. Hey 12.5 miles today. My best.","Winding stair gap

The 3rd one was Wesser Bald with a fire tower on top. Again the views were fantastic, you could see part of Fontana reservoir and far beyond the snowcapped Smokies.
  Most of the day I've been hiking with 4 old guys like me. We got to the shelter first and now there's 6 of us crowded in.","Licking gap

  Once I got going after a while the trail dropped into Nantahala valley 5 miles of decent. For a while the trail clung to a ridge with drop offs on both sides.
  Finally down with aching knees I had lunch in the restaurant right on the river. 2 beers a burger and salad and a extra chicken burger to take up the mountain. Now I'm stealth camping about 2 miles below Swim Bald.","Wesser Bald shelter

   Got to the shelter with less than an hour before dark. Pitched the tent, had the chicken salad mix, too tired to cook. 
  12.7 miles today.","Stealth camp below Swim Bald

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584264,"Tenting during the night was interesting. The wind really picked up and buffeted the tent. I could hear each gust coming. Tent did fine thankfully. I always have to get up to pee. Quite a hassle but the stars have been amazing.
  Had some pop tarts and got going about 8:50. For many miles the trail was easy. Winding along the sides of hills instead of over them. I had lunch at the Cable Gap shelter. Said to be the oldest on the AT. Then easy was over. Tough climb, at the top Fontana lake came into view. But instead of going right down, the trail climbed a succession of false summits before finally descending. Steep descent but lower I started to see the first wildflowers of the hike.
   Finally down to the parking lot I saw Spirit Man who I'd hiked with part of the day. He was waiting for a ride to the Hike Inn. I quickly called and got a room too. They shuttled 4 of us hikers to town for dinner, spaghetti with all you can eat salad. Then re supply for first leg of the Smokies.","Brown fork gap shelter

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584662,"Enjoyed my stay at the Hiker Inn.  Jeff and Nancy are wonderful hosts.  Very much worth it to stay there.  The Inn also has an interesting Indian arrowhead collection. Jeff took hikers, K2 and Do and me back to our starts.  I was dropped off at Fontana Marina to restart my hike. As I hiked into the woods, the rain began.  But stopped as I passed by the Fontana ‘Hilton’ Shelter.  Then on over the Dam, which has an amazing view.  The mountains just started to peek out of the clouds and the sky brighten. The trail followed the road another mile, then I reached the trailhead with a box for thru hiker registration for the 8-day pass. The tough climb up Shuck-stack Mtn.  The sun came fully out, the birds were singing and soon I was down to shorts and a T-shirt.  My shorts stayed up as long as my pack was clipped on, otherwise I’ve lost enough weight that they would fall right down. On the way up the mountain I met up with 3 hikers and they told me that they were doing a celebratory hike, because last year when they were attempting to thru hike, one of them fell ill and was later diagnosed with cancer.  After chemo, he has recovered enough to return to the trail.  Good luck to him and his full recovery.Made it to the top of ShuckStack and it’s fire tower had fabulous views all around!  Easy trails to the Shelter, arrived around 4.  Glad to be sleeping in the shelter as storms rolled in.  You could see them below us, lightning flashing as it got dark.  Interesting experience that night, I was in the top platform of the Shelter, the tin roof two feet above me when the hailstorm hit.  The noise from the hail hitting the tin right above my head was terrific.","Hiker Inn

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584663,"Leaving the Shelter, started climbing in the mist, then the sun came out.  The trail steadily climbed, then open area appeared. They looked like old orchards.  Spotted a bald area near the top of Rocky Top, where I was determined to eat my lunch.  Reached it around two, beautiful view, took my shirt and shoes off to relax and enjoy the sun. A ridge runner came by and checked my pass and we chatted a while. Then on to the top, where I sang Rocky Top Tennessee in celebration.  Next, Thunderhead Mtn, where the trail got torturous.  Mainly a trench filled with loose rocks on steep grades.  My hiking speed dropped to just over a mile an hour. Reached the Shelter around 6.  With the longer days, more hiking time is great.  Met an female hiker from Australia, ‘Mel’.  She was fun to listen to with here stories and impressions of America.  Good luck to Mel on her journey.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584664,"This was a short day, due to the spacing of the shelters.  Not enough energy to make the trek over Klingmans Dome to the further Shelter.  Trail continued to be rugged. I would sometimes hear a thumping, it was so low I thought it was my heartbeat, but finally figured it was a ruffled grouse or some similar bird. As I got closer to the Shelter the landscape changed dramatically to dark pine trees with mossy groundcover predominating.  Reached the empty Shelter at 2, just as it started to rain.  With the empty space I was able to spread my gear and tent out to dry.  But by nightfall, there were about 30 people in and around the shelter.  Late arrivals were disappointed to see the shelter was completely full and had to set up their tents outside.  Of course, that night it poured.  Glad I was in the Shelter, but the noise of the rain dripping off the trees onto the tin roof kept me awake for a good while.Thanks to the father and son hikers that were experts at coaxing a fire out of wet wood on this cold evening we had a warm fire inside the shelter.","Silers Bald Shelter

  I climbed on thru rainforest like woods. Thick mossy dark and mysterious. The shoulders of Clingmans appeared with clouds wafting across the top. Climbed the observation walk. There was 1 opening in the clouds thru which you could se Gatlinburg way below. Took a quick picture and got going.
   Forgot to mention today was the day I would meet my son and sister. About a mile down the mountain here came my son. Man o man was it good to see him. We switched packs and I became a slack packer the remainder of the way to the road.
  A the road my sister drove up in the truck and did some trail angeling. Beer, sodas, and chips.  Ahh very good. Trouble is the weather didn't cooperate. Rain intensified mixed with sleet.

Stacker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584813,"During the night the snow started in town. Started gathering information on storm ‘Toby’ mainly raging up north but also in the mountains around here. Reading Trail journal accounts showed bad conditions up in the Smokies with the road still closed and hikers ether stranded or making heroic treks to the road with occasional rescues. I judged to skip a head north where it seemed the snow was a little less. So up north we drove to near Virginia and the Damascus area. After setting up the camper my sister drove us up the mountain on rt. 421 to the AT. at Low Gap, mile 455.  My son would join me for 2 days. We doned our packs and got going around 3:45 with 5 miles till the next Shelter. The snow here was about 3” deep with some drifts. The going was fairly the climbs mild and the path somewhat trodden down already. We reached the shelter around 6:00 cooked, got a feeble fire going, and tried to go to sleep on a very cold night.","Pidgin Forge
