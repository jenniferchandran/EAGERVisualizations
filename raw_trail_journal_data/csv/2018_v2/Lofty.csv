Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584194,"I have been preparing a lot of logistics as well the last few weeks, mostly about bills, my houses, my dog, and other things that need to be taken care of while I am gone for 6 months (like all of my wonderful plants).  It has been quite the experience going through all of my expenses and other usually mundane day-to-day adulating things to coordinate a successful handoff to other people for the next several months.  My wonderful mother, Paula, has graciously offered to take care of my dog, Daisy, and to take care of all of my bills and expenses relating to my houses.  My very outdoorsy brother, Chris, has agreed to take care of my house in NH for the summer and coordinate with all of my friends and family who would like to visit.  The beautiful Kimberly has undertaken the daunting task of keeping track of me and my mileage to basically save me with food mail-drops and other re-supply items.  She will be tracking my progress and ETAs in my excel sheet as I go.  My roommate, Whitney, and Uncle Jimbo will take care of Malden and make sure the house does not burn down while I am away.
I am so grateful to everyone who is willing to step-up and take care of my stuff while I go MIA for 6 months.
Today is also my last day at Kirkland & Ellis.  I want to thank all of my colleagues for their words or encouragement and support the last few weeks.  I am so grateful my firm allowed me to take a 6-month sabbatical for this journey.  
I also want to thank all of my former colleagues at Ropes & Gray for their wonderful and ongoing support.  
To those of you reading the first few entries, good for you.  I have to do 3 of them in order to get my journal published online for the rest of my hike.  I promise it will get more entertaining as we go. . .
My next entry should probably be about my gear.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Thu",0
Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584196,"A few weeks ago I went to REI in Reading and sat with a gentleman, Peter, for a few hours.  He hiked the AT a few years ago and agreed to go through my pack (via a ""pack-explosion"") to discard everything I would not need (main goal is ultralight hiking).  He took out several things, mostly first-aid stuff (I am a DeVits and have the ""worry about everything syndrome"" so my first-aid kit was admittedly overboard).  One thing he took out was my toothpaste.  He said I can just get salt packets from towns as I hike through... I said I would add the 3 ounces to keep my mouth tasting like mint at least for some portions of this hike.I upgraded my pack to the Osprey 58 EJA and upgraded my tent to the Big Agnes platinum 2 person tent.  I have my Marmot sleeping bag and Therm-a-rest neoair sleeping pad.  I have the Katadyn 3L water filter/source.  I have my jet fuel and cook stove, along with several pouches of dry food.  My pot and spork.  I have a small bag of first-aid stuff with a headlight and extra batteries.  I only have one pair of hiking clothes and one pair of camp clothes (along with my crocs for camp).  I am bringing 2 pairs of socks.  I have my rain pants and rain jacket, as well as my Canada Goose down outer layer (got to love client gifts) and my Smart Wool 250s for the first part of my hike where I may encounter 15-20 degree weather.  I have hiking poles and sun hat - even bought transition glasses (so I don't have to carry sunglasses, too).  The transition sunglasses really solidified the fact that I am turning into my mother. . .Overall, with a full 5 day supply of food and 4 Liters of water, my pack will weigh around 29-30 pounds.  As I hike through from town to town and my food weight goes up and down, I will probably stick around 25-30 pounds.  Once I get through the colder weather from the Smoky Mountains and Blue Ridge Mountains, I will ship my cold weather clothes home and that should lighten my bag a bit.Getting ready!Jenelle",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Thu",0

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585323,"Today, I hiked from Amicalola Lodge to Springer Mountain (7.5 miles, also known as ‘the Approach Trail’). It only took 4 hours (8:45 am to 12:45 pm). At the summit of Springer Mountain is the southern terminus of the AT. This is where I saw my first white blaze!There’s a registration notebook in the container in the rock (see pics!) I signed in and moved on to the AT.
I hiked another 2.8 miles to Stover Creek shelter where John was packing up from the night before. He was a slow moving man from Kentucky. I set up my sleeping stuff in the loft and started dinner. By that point, Brett had arrived, followed by another couple. I couldn’t help but notice the large fire pit, and offered to start one while the others were still setting up. Everyone agreed it would be nice to get the chill out! It was cold and damp all day. Once the fire got going, everyone started circling around. By the end of the night, a dozen or so others joined us, including; Chris (Roamer - the guy I took the shuttle with), Mauricio, Ken (from Indiana - he was the first guy I saw on the Approach Trail), John stayed (slow moving to not moving - it took him 7 days to get where I was in 2), Lucas and his friend from CT, Glen (the forager), Kelly and her dog Morrison (I saw them earlier on the trail) and JC.","

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585324,"Today, I hiked 13 miles from Stover Creek shelter to Gooch Mountain shelter. I hiked with Glen from upstate New York (he has a daughter (a public defender) and a son (a tax attorney)). Chris (Roamer) also hiked with us. We met another thru-hiker Cody who kept moving after Gooch. I am feeling good except for the 6 blisters I have on my feet (3 on each foot). I ate 4 packets of Mac and cheese for dinner! It was delicious. Sleeping last night was on and off - probably got a total of 5 hours of sleep. Lots of snoring - Chewbacca like snoring. I woke up at 7:30 and left the shelter around 8:30am. Stopped and tried to ping my family (I guess it didn’t work). I took off my jacket and rearranged a few times. Probably didn’t start hiking until 8:45am. Got to Gooch Mountain around 3:45pm. Heading to sleep early as tomorrow a few of us are trying to hit Neel Gap (15.6 miles).","

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585524,"Today we hiked 15.6 miles from Stover Creek Gap Shelter to Neel Gap. I started my day with my first bit of trail magic- some gentleman had breakfast pizza (hot and fresh) waiting for us in Stover Creek Gap. It was delicious and really started our day off right!
We knew it was going to be a hard push and that we could check in at Jarrod Gap (10.6 miles into the hike) to see how we felt about pushing to Neel Gap. In order to stay between Jarrod Gap and Neel Gap you need a bear canister because the bears are so bad on Blood Mountain. I am hiking with Roamer, Pacer (Glen) and Tumbleweed (Brett). We gave Glen the trail name Pacer because he sets our pace (we are averaging 2 miles per hour). Roamer and Tumbleweed already had their trail names from many years of hiking all over the world. They are much more experienced than me or Pacer, but the 4 of us make a great team. Roamer and Pacer are both over 60 I think and Tumbleweed is 44.
At Jarrod Gap we decided to make a push and go the extra 5 miles to Neel Gap as it was still early in the day and we had plenty of daylight (thinking we could just bunk up at Mountain Crossings). However, about a mile in, we realized it was probably packed from the previous day’s wave of hikers. I only had enough service to text Kimberly and ask her to call to see what they had available. With only 6 bunks available and first come first serve, we knew we wouldn’t get a spot (there were at least 5 people ahead of us making their way there). Thankfully, Kimberly was able to call Blood Mountain cabins and reserve us a cabin! It saved us. Just as we were getting to the cabin it started down pouring and thundering and lightening. We were dry and warm. I also earned my trail name “Lofty”. The guys gave it to me because I always sleep in the loft (2 shelters had lofts and the cabin had a loft). We stopped at Mountain Crossings and got two frozen pizzas and I got a diet coke to finish the rest of my bourbon.
My feet are killing me and my blisters look terrible. I jokingly say I might lose my little toes, but now I am starting to believe it. I soaked them in hot salt water and treated them but they are torn up. I also got duct tape and moleskin from Mountain Crossings so hopefully that saves me tomorrow. I have several blisters now on each foot and it is sore every step I take. Hopefully they calm down a bit.","

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585525,"I woke up and my feet were feeling slightly better and the blisters were pretty dried up. I had to pop a couple of places but all in all seemed OK. After eating breakfast and wrapping up my toes we headed out for a “short” 10 mile day to a tent site right after Low Gap Shelter. We had a great pace going but then my moleskin on my two little toes came off and we stopped to fix them. I remembered I had two little cotton balls my Auntie Joyce gave me right before I left, so I used those with duct tape. To my surprise, those were the only things that worked! Auntie Joyce for the win! I ended up stopping 6-7 times to change my socks so that my feet stayed dry. Every time I changed my socks I would safety pin the other 2 pairs to the outside of my bag to dry so I could keep rotating them. It seemed to really help. My feet are the only thing killing my morale right now and I hope I can solve the problem sooner rather than later. I think I put way too much weatherproofing stuff on my boots such that the shoe is suffocating my feet and I sweat immediately. I am going to try and wash my boots in Hiawassee tomorrow to see if that helps get rid of some of the heat trap. I experienced some more trail magic today (twice) with oranges and water and Mountain Dew. Everyone is so nice here. 
Our 10 miles turned into 14.9 miles today because the tent site we were looking for did not have water, so we had to hike on. I am currently in my tent with all of my clothes on trying to stay warm. It is 34 degrees outside. My feet are out to dry but I have a hand warmer in the bottom of the sleeping bag to help keep them warm. It is very cold tonight and my morale is low with bad feet. Everything feels great except my feet... I miss home. Around mile 14 I almost started crying just because I was in so much pain and really missing home. Every step hurts like crazy and my two pinkie toes have blisters going over my nails and are inflamed and red. Hoping the short 6.5 miles into town tomorrow and a night out eating with a warm shower and hotel bed helps my feet and my mind. Heading to bed.","

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585559,"Today we woke up at 2am when Pacer got up to go to the bathroom.  We broke down our tents and started hiking at 3am to get into Hiawassee and take a “Nero Day” (near zero day). None of us were sleeping well as it was cold and we were in tents. Unfortunately though, we didn’t stop hiking the night before until around 7pm, so my feet didn’t have much time to heal. They are looking really bad - I didn’t even take the duct tape and cotton balls off of my pinkie toes because I figured I’d just leave them as is until we got into town and I could clean them, etc. We had to hike 6.3 miles to get to Unicoi Gap. Most of the hike was downhill (the most painful part of my hikes for my blisters and knees). The uphill parts were rocks and lots of roots which also kills the toes. I stopped several times with tears in my eyes, swearing at how painful every step was for my feet. It took us 5 hours to go the 6.3 miles mostly because I was going so dang slow. Luckily for me once we got to Unicoi Gap, Survivor Dave showed up dropping off hikers and it was a morale boost to see a familiar face. He drove us into town and dropped us off at the Budget Inn. Our rooms weren’t ready and Pacer and I decided to walk to Huddle House in town for a huge breakfast. On the way, we saw a Holiday Inn (which looked much nicer and cleaner than the budget inn) so we decided to reserve a room there instead. Tumbleweed and Roamer stayed at Budget Inn. 
We went to the dollar store after breakfast to get some resupply stuff and I also picked up Epsom Salt so I could soak my feet/body. I took a bath and relaxed the rest of the day until dinner. We went to the local steakhouse and I got a great burger. Afterwards, everyone agreed my feet were too bad to head out in the morning with the guys and I had to say my goodbyes to Roamer and Tumbleweed. Pacer and I headed back to the hotel and watched the NCAA tournament until we fell asleep. In the AM he woke up early to head out with the group and I said my goodbye to him as well. We all exchanged numbers in case we can run into each other later down the trail. I decided to stay at Holiday Inn another night and rest for Easter. Hopefully my feet feel better soon.","

I had to climb from 1800 feet to 4300 feet.  When I finally made it to the summit I rested for a bit and then made it to the next shelter around 4:15pm.  At that point I had hiked 10.5 miles but was feeling pretty good and knew that Max Patch (with some of the most beautiful views on the trail) was only 6.6 miles ahead.  It would make for a superb sunset.  I met Triple Zero earlier in the day and he said he was shooting for Max Patch so I decided to join him.  We had to go from 2800 feet to 4600 feet but boy was it worth it.  I quickly set up my tent and changed my clothes and then enjoyed a wonderful sunset overlooking the mountains we just conquered!  I uploaded a few pictures from the day!,"Davenport Gap Shelter

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589042,"Hi everyone,Today I woke up on Max Patch to a beautiful Sunrise and a warm tent.  The sun beaming on my tent actually provided heat and made my morning routine a lot better - it’s easier to put on damp clothes (from sweat) when it is warm!  Anyways, I packed up and ate breakfast. Some other hikers were trying to call the ATC to get updates on the fire near Hot Springs.  We heard there was a section of the trail closed and that they were making hikers get off at Garenflo Gap and shuttling them into Hot Springs - about 7 miles of trail closed.  Most of the hikers decided just to shuttle into Hot Springs from Max Patch because they didn’t want to chance hiking near the fire but I felt safe enough to get to the gap and then find a way into town.  Triple Zero and I left around 9:00 am.  It was an easy hike down and we made it 5.5 miles in 2 hours and 15 minutes.  We took a break for a half hour and ate some food.  A US National Forrest ranger was at the road and said the fire was small (40 acres with 200 acre containment - I guess that out into perspective for me the fact that they have 2000+ acres of fire).  So Triple Zero and I moved on to Garenflo Gap and we started our ascent over the last two peaks before Garenflo Gap.  They were tough.  All in all we did about 14.5 miles to get to Garenflo.  Unfortunately for us, there was no shuttle.  The US National Forest ranger at Garenflo said that we could walk 2 miles to the highway and someone would pick us up.  So we headed out down the road and luckily about 1.5 miles down, Linda, a nice woman, picked us up and dropped us off at the diner in town.  After we ate a lot of food, we each got a room in town and showered.  We went out for a beer with other hikers and then hung out at Laughing Heart hostel with Jeff and Caitlin (the managers) and several other hikers until around midnight by their fire.  We walked back to our rooms and called it a night!","Max Patch

We stopped half way to rest and eat lunch but it was still very inflamed and swollen.  We still pushed onto the shelter as we really didn't have an alternative for the evening.  When we got to the shelter it was already full so we found a flat spot right behind the shelter between the shelter and huge rocks - hoping this would block some of the wind and the weather coming in.  We set up our tent and got our sleeping bags and pads and what not out, changed out of our stinky, sweaty clothes and made dinner.  We had macaroni and cheese with mashed potatoes and hot sauce.  It was a great combination.  Everyone crawled into the tents and sleeping bags before 7pm in light of the rain, so we did too.  In the tent, we realized Kim's heel was pretty bad so we made the decision to hike off the mountain the next day (11.4 miles) and get a rental car so she could slack pack me for the next 10 days she is supposed to be here.  We thought this was the perfect plan so she could still hike her own hike on the AT and I can make up all the miles I missed between Hot Springs and FS 293 in TN near Black Bear.  We spent the rest of the evening planning our next 10 days together, reserving a rental car and watching the season finale of Homeland on my phone! It started pouring around midnight and the thunder and lightning was intense - especially since we were literally at the top of a mountain.  I woke up again around 3am to severe rain and thunder/lightning and enjoyed the storm for a bit.  We stayed dry in our tent but I don't think either of us slept well at all.","US 321

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590716,"Today I slacked packed 10.5 miles as fast as I could so that I could get back to Hot Springs and hang out with Kim.  Kim met me at the end of the hike for a few miles.  She had her brother ship her sneakers down so she didn’t have to wear her boots that were aggravating her heel.  Also, Kim somehow continues to find these remote roads to pick me up without service and it is very impressive. Today was a pretty easy hike. We went to the library afterwards to look up directions for the next day’s hike as it is going to be around 20 miles. We slept in our tent again at Laughing Heart hostel and Kim gave both Jeff and Kate a haircut with just buzzers - of course they came out great.  Because I am hiking for about 8-9 hours tomorrow, Kim made plans with Kate to go work her farm and visit a few locals in the area.  We sat by the fire with Flavortown and Gingerballs and a few other hikers staying at the hostel and had a great time!","Tanyard Gap

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590720,"Today we woke up at Laughing Heart early and made our way out to Devil Fork Gap - right on the NC/TN line.  I decided to hike those section southbound so that we could end the day closer to Hot Springs and spend our last night there in the rooms at the Tavern (we knew after a 20 mile day I would need a bed and a bath to soak).  On our way to the gap, we stopped and got a coffee at the best little country store (the woman made a mean mocha espresso) and then got lost a bit.  We finally found our way and I headed out on my longest day yet.  Kim then met Kate and had the best day on her vacation - she visited Kate’s house and saw her 25 chickens and garden, etc. and then went to a couples farm/work place.  She helped work the farm and got a tour of their wood working space and basket weaving area. Needless to say, her day was way cooler than mine...I hiked up from Devil Fork Gap southbound to Big Firescald Knob.  The AT guide book describes this section as “rocky and strenuous” and boy they were not kidding.  Unfortunately for me, I hit this section as miles 11-14 of my 20 mile day and the rock scramble and ankle eaters just killed my knees and ankles.  I was in a lot of pain after this but still had 5-6 miles to go.  By the end, I had to descend back down to Log Cabin Drive for 5 miles totaling an almost 2500 foot drop.  I was wincing in so much pain by the time Kim hiked up a bit to get me and I literally laid in the back of the car while she drove me back to our room in Hot Springs.  I took an epsom salt bath and ate a big dinner.  We decided I needed a smaller day so I will only do 8.7 miles tomorrow.  Great day nonetheless just being on the trail with Kim and hiking with and by the same folks for a few days in a row.  I think the other thru-hikers are wondering how I’ve been slack packing so much but they’ve been nice about it!  I saw gingerballs, Great Dane and the other guys today towards the end of my hike and they were booking it!","Log Cabin Drive

Again,  next day woke up early and went to Fontana Dam visitor center (about 15 miles).  My parents picked me up there to drive me back to Northern TN to finish off TN and move on to VA!","Dicks Creek Gap

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592514,"So....  my parents picked me up at Fontana Dam.  The plan was to spend a day in Gatlinburg and go to Clingmans Dome for a day and then drive back up northern TN where i left off with Kim... but... on the way to northern TN I got very homesick and decided I needed a mental health break and wanted to go home.  Since my parents already had a trip planned to Gettysburg, I decided to go with them.  However, on our way through southern PA, we drove by the AT crossing and I could just feel the trail calling me back.  I talked to my parents and they said they would drop me back off at the trail after Gettysburg so that I could hike the northeast and be closer to home for the summer.  My goal is to finish the northeast and then head back to finish VA/WV/MD before the fall.
First off, Gettysburg was breathtaking.  I cried several times and had numerous eye opening moments about our country’s history that was brought even more to life after hiking through southern Appalachia the last few months.  Happy to have those conversations live, over drinks, anytime.
Anywho, since I was in PA, I called my friend Ed (I met Ed hiking the presidential traverse in the Whites a few years ago).  I knew he lived nearby and thought I’d take the chance he was around memorial day weekend and wanted to hike.  To my luck, he was and he did!  He met me at the trailhead on Sunday, 5/27 and we hiked a great 23.1 miles together.  He and Gina made pizza for dinner and let me stay at his house and shower!  He even offered to slack pack me the next day, too!  On 5/28, I hiked 18.1 miles and just happened to stumble upon the best trail magic - the Fogarty’s 25th annual Memorial Day picnic on top of Peter’s Mountain!  The trail truly provides!  Shout out to Ed for picking me up that day with a banana, leftover pizza and a gatorade!  I stayed with Ed again and washed my clothes and then headed out the next morning.
On 5/29 I hiked 18.6 miles with Scars, a former CIA officer!  Check him out on youtube - Through Hiking with Scars.  We hit it off and decided to hitch into Lickdale because we were making great time and wanted lunch.  We got subway and ice cream and then hitched back to the trail!  We set up camp, had great conversation about the role of government and how to properly analyze the gray area of the law and called it a night.
On 5/30, Scars and I hiked for 19.6 miles with great conversation about war and peace and individual rights and international affairs.  We stayed at the Rock and Sole hostel as we thought we were going to get bad storms.  They picked us up from the trailhead and we ate dinner and showered.  On 5/31, Scars and I hiked 14.5 into Port Clinton and his wonderful in-laws met us to drop off his new shoes.  They also drove me to fed ex to get my drop box to resupply!  We all got dinner and then they dropped us off at Port Clinton hotel.  I had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed their company!
Overall, I miss home.  I miss Kim.  I miss Daisy. I miss my life.  But, I know I am on this trail for a reason and the last few days proved that to me.  I will keep walking...

Lofty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593442,"Hello everyone!  Sorry for the delay in entries.  The past week has been busy going from PA to NJ (with a short stay in NY).  Over the last 8 days, I've averaged around 18.3 miles per day.  My feet and ankles are really feeling it lately.  Short summary of my week below!  Hope you all are doing well!  June 1 - I hiked from Port Clinton, PA to Allentown Hiking Club Shelter - 22.5 miles.  I really pushed my limit today with skipping bad water resources and got into the shelter really dehydrated and had to walk .5 miles to get water anyways.  I learned that even though I want to get somewhere, my body needs water and food - even if ""it is only 4 miles away.""  I've been doing so many miles that I forget 4 miles is still a long distance for your body to perform and today was a good reminder to properly fuel my body.  I drank 2 liters of water/propel and then made dinner.  I found a great dehydrated food option from Good to Go from Maine - Thai Curry and Vegetable Korma.  Love them.  Anyways, Wilson (the guy from Germany) and Webster were here as well.  The rocks in PA are no joke and killed my ankles today (Dan's Pulpit in particular).June 2 - I hiked from the shelter to Palmerton, PA - literally a superfund trailhead.  I went 17.7 miles and stayed at Bert's Steakhouse hostel.  $20 for a bunk, shower and free laundry.  I had a great steak and cheese and resupplied at the Family Dollar.  Wilson was here as well as Sprinkles and Finger Food.  Also met Animal, a flip-flopper. Palmerton, PA is a very interesting town.  As with most Appalachian land, it was originally land of the Native Americans.  In the early 1900's, coal was found in the mountains and soon after in 1912 the town ""incorporated"" itself into ""Palmerton"" - named after the New Jersey Zinc Company's then-president, S.S. Palmer.  The Native Americans were displaced and the private company built the town and brought in Europeans to operate their coal facilities and zinc smelting operations.  Also interesting is the fact that there was an Underground Railroad station in Palmerton.  The town and the Blue Mountain were deemed Superfund sites in the 1980's and have been undergoing remediation ever since.  On my hike into Palmerton, I had to go over the Knife's Edge (rock scrambling on a ridge) and other lovely PA rocks the entire way ... which my ankles just love!June 3 - I hiked out from Lehigh Gap near Palmerton for 15.8 miles to the Leroy A. Smith shelter.  I sang ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"" for like 3 miles today because I thought the name of the Shelter was Leroy Brown - it wasn't.  Anyways today's hike started up the Devil's Pulpit which is a rocky, steep trail that involved putting my poles away so that I could hand-over-hand rock climb up a bunch of big rocks, really high in the sky with cliffs on the other side for about a mile.  It was ""fun"" but my heart was racing and legs were shaking the entire time.  There was a water source at the top but it is ""emergency only"" and drinking not recommended due to high zinc levels...  I got to the shelter and spent the night making S'mores with Sprinkles, Finger Food, Animal, Wilson and Webster (thanks to Sprinkles' mom).June 4 - On my way out of the shelter in the morning, I met Patton and his dog Tank.  We hiked the whole day together.  He was good company and Tank was a cute dog.  We went 20.5 miles to the Delaware Water Gap (which is right before the NJ/PA state line).  More PA rocks today... lovely.  I resupplied at the outfitter in town and the nice woman working drove us to the local town area.  We stayed at the Quality Inn in East Stroudsburg, PA.  I ate two dinners and an appetizer. June 5 - I got an uber pretty early and headed back to Delaware Water Gap.  My feet and ankles were killing me from the PA rocks so I decided to do a ""half-day"" and only hiked 10.5 miles out of PA and into NJ.  I crossed Delaware River Bridge.  I hiked up to Mohican Outdoor Center - an AMC hut.  I ordered a BLT for lunch and had a soda.  I decided to stay in their bunkhouse for the night.  There were several older flip-floppers there and I enjoyed their company.  Little Feat and Eclipses are a couple from Vermont.  I talked to Little Feat at length about his hearing aid so I could report back to my dad.  Learned a lot.  We started a fire and I ordered a grilled cheese for dinner.  Slept like a baby after watching the Malden city council ordinance meeting all night.  Great place to stay!June 6 - I woke up and had a big breakfast and then headed out.  I went 21.3 miles to the Gren Anderson Shelter.  On my way, I stopped at a trailhead and got dinner at the Mountain House tavern.  Great salad and burger.  Hopped back on the trail after dinner and went the last 3 miles to the shelter.  Sturgeon and Steady were there and we all went to bed pretty early.  June 7 - went from the shelter to Unionville, NY - totaling 20.1 miles.  Unionville permits hikers to sleep in their local park.  It was great.  I set up my tent and then got pizza and a drink at Annabelle's Pizza and Wit's End tavern, respectively.  On my way, I stopped for an hour at High Point State Park HQ to recharge my phone, get a free pepsi and eat my lunch (tuna packet).  It was hot out and I was making good time so I took a midday break.  I saw a black bear today.  I was crossing the dirt road on the trail and there was this cute medium size bear with his front legs up on the electrical pole on the side of the road.  At first I thought it was fake - like someone put a statue there.  It was staring at me and then all of a sudden turned his head, jumped down and started walking down the trail away from me - the trail I needed to walk down.  Luckily I was on the phone with Kim so I just started making noise and talking louder and he meandered down the trail..  I waited a few minutes and then followed - being as loud as possible.  He finally took a left off trail and I moved quickly past him.  I then flushed 3 deer, saw a snapping turtle and a beautiful woodpecker.","Port Clinton, PA
