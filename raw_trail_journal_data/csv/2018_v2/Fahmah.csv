Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594307,"Good Morning All. This is a continuation of the hike for Fahmah and Klipspringer they started last year. They began in March, 2017 at Springer Mountain in GA and hiked to Uncle Johnie's in Tennessee. When Klip went back home last year, I was sure that was the last hike. Neither of the guys were happy and both felt they probably wouldn't return to the AT. It didn't take long after Klip returned to So Africa to start getting the hiking itch again. He talked about coming over, then not, then medical issues with his leg, then that was okay and finally, yes, booked his flight and was returning on June 1, 2018. We were excited to have him come back again. Fahmah still has about 150 miles left of his 2nd hike he bagan in 2010 in Maine to hike. I had made some changes in my life and second to getting healthy (losing weight and putting diabetes in recession) a personal goal was to walk on the AT with Fahmah for some distance one day. Well, this was my opportunity. At first we were going to start at Uncle Johnie's in Tennessee. I considered hiking to Roan Mountian with them. But the guys decided the shorter drive to Harpers would be our choice, and hike north from there this time. Klip arrived on June 1, 2018 and we took a few days to get over jet lag, take care of some personal issues, and shop for needed supplies. We left for Harpers on the 5th of June. We had contacted our good friend, Just Jack, their hiking partner of 2007, and he arranged to meet us on the 5th at Harpers. We rested and caught up on the news and set off on our first day of hiking on the 7th. We brought my vehicle to Weaverton Cliffs Road and drove back to Harpers and began.
The planned hike was about 3 1/2 miles. This was my first time hiking and carrying a pack. I put my pack on with my tent, a full resevoir of water and other items just to see if I would be able to carry it. We walked from the hotel to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (.8 mi all uphill) and then down through the village historical district and down to the park and the Footbridge that crosses the Potomac, enters in to Maryland, and the start of out AT hike. The C&O Canal Towpath, 2.8 miles that up till 1924 mules towed barges up the canal with the Potomac River on the other side. What is left of the canal is full of logs and turtles, snakes and birds. It was a very hot and humid day, but the path was well shaded and relatively flat. Near the end we headed up a ways and came to a railway crossing and a little up hill to where the car was parked. All day Jack walked ahead of us, pushing himself, and needed to convince himself that he would be able to make the next 3 days in the woods. As we came to the railway crossing, we found Jack laid out, snoozing on a large flat rock! He looked like Rip Van Winkle without the beard. I was real happy to reach the vehicle and to get my boots off. It was a long first hike for me, but I proved I could do it, with a pack on. The guys were very supportive and said I did ""real good""","Harpers Ferry

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594308,"We got up this morning, did our final tweaks to our packs, filled our waters and brought Jack's vehicle to Turner's Gap in Boonsboro and left it, then drove my car to Weaverton Cliffs Rd and left it there. Notice the name of the road (CLIFFS)? That should be a clue as to what our hike started like. We started at elevation 420ft and climbed to 1100ft. The first mile was all up hill. When we got to the Weaverton Cliffs side trail, it was overcast, we were exhausted, and we decided not to walk that 2.1m to see the view. We continued on to the shelter. Klip said we should rest often (about every mile/hour), and release our pack and have a snack. Remember to always keep hydrated. The up hills were steep and the down hills were rocky and we had to carefully maneuver so as not to slip or twist an ankle. Jack walked way ahead of us. Klip caught him a couple of times. Fahmah walked with me, patiently waiting for me and urging me on with his support. He was so proud of me to be a rooky at 70 and to be doing so well.  I kind of gave myself a trail name of ""Christmas"" because they were always waiting for me like Christmas :)
We hiked on to the shelter.  It was the beginning of a beautiful, spring weekend and when we got to the shelter it was filled with a boy scout troop.   Jack found a nice flat platform on which to set his tent.  We weren't so fortunate.  Our sites were rocky and slanted, but we set up our tents and got ready to relax.  I learned how to light our Jet Boil and cook Mountain House food, beef lasagna, which I thought was pretty good.  Fahmah was too tired to have me cook his, but he ended up eating 1/2 of mine as I filled up fast.  The sites filled up fast as more hikers came in and another boy scout troop who had a leader that knew everything about everything and vocalized it constantly with an annoying, loud voice.  They set up camp right behind us.  
I had hydrated real good all day, 1 1/2 liter water and 1 qt of Gatorade plus 1/2 liter of water to cook.  I never had to stop on the trail to relieve myself, but once I laid down, I was up 5 times, 4 of them before I even went to sleep.  Good thing it was dark and I had also heard that peeing around your tent keeps the snakes away!  My tent was on a slant, I mistakenly put a liner around the pad and I slid around all night.  I felt the rocks under the pad and heard Fahmah every time he turned on his new REI pad.
We were awoken at day break by the annoying scout leader with the annoying voice saying that he thought everybody should be awake by daybreak! What a way to teach his troop courtesy to others - NOT!
We were up then and took our tents down and ate breakfast.  We had been advised that the spring at Ed Garvey shelter was a breeding ground for copperhead rattle snakes.  The night before, the scout leader at the shelter (he and his troop were quiet!) had shown Jack a photo of a huge copperhead making its way under the shelter where they stayed.  Jack said there was no way he was hiking the 1/5 mile down a steep incline to the snake ridden spring to get water.  Klip went down for him and Fahmah went and got our water.  It wasn't that bad they said and saw no snakes.  We had to treat our water in our 1 liter Nalgene bottles.  A 2 part system that you mix 7 drops of each in a mixing cap, let it sit for 5 minutes and then add it to the water.  It took me quite a while to fill my 1 1/2 liter reservoir and Fahmah's 2 liter and the 2 1 liter Nalgene bottles, plus my 1/2 liter bottle.   Jack was the first one to leave the camp.  Klip followed behind him and then Fahmah and me.  The treating of the last bottle of water was a hoot.  I did the the mix of the drops 3 times for one of the bottles, each time, after waiting for the 5 minutes.  One time I sat on it and spilt it, the 2nd time I started packing up and emptied it by mistake, and finally the third time was a charm.  
I learned a lot of things this day.   Hiking isn't just for fun and games and seeing beautiful sites.  There are responsibilities and hard work.  You have to keep hydrated, set up camp when you are almost too tired to move, and cook dinner and eat, hungry or not.  Be courteous to other hikers, the hikers on the up hill have the right of way, hikers coming up behind you intentionally make a noise so that you are aware they are behind you so they don't scare you and so you can step out of their way, and you rely on the support of your other hiking partners.  I learned that I wasn't alone out there too.  I appreciated the support and prayers of all of you back home and to God in heaven for his support.  I felt him hiking and lifting me every step of the way.
All is good, God is GREAT.","Weaverton Cliffs Rd, Parking Lot

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594315,"Jack started off first, Klip followed a little after, and Fahmah and I left camp 1/2 hour after at about 10:30 am. Today's hike would be a 4.1 relatively flat hike, with few ups and downs. It was still rocky but turned out to be a beautiful, sunny day, not quite as humid as the one before or after. We did as Klip taught us, rested about every mile/hour, snacked, we saw deer and met up with Klip, as he waited patiently for us at certain stops. We went through Gathland State park where there is a nice water faucet, bathrooms (where I took a quick sponge bath) and beautiful grounds with Civil War and War Correspondents monument. We caught up with Jack and Klip there and had a good rest for a while. A local showed us a short cut at the end of the park (a blue blaze) which connected to the AT but just at the Crompton Gap Shelter where we were headed. It was a tough up hill for a mile or so, but we landed! 
There was a beautiful, clear brook/spring flowing down the mountain past the shelter which was our water source here. I found the water from the State Park had a metal/oily taste and was happy to treat the stream water and use that for the next day. There were a few hikers at the shelter. Jack decided to stay in the shelter. Klip, Fahmah and I set up our tents up on the side of the hill. Again, it was extremely rocky and our trip from where we camped to the shelter was very steep. I nearly fell going down, right in to a pile of rocks. 
I learned lots more today, like how much you use your poles for balance. It gives you another set of legs and you really learn to rely on them. They saved me many times during the trip. Also, I hadn't mentioned the privies!! The first night at the Ed Garvey shelter, because it was so busy there, there were waits. But when I was finally able to use it, I had the surprise that the first step was missing. I had to put a knee on the next step and pull myself up to go up the remaining 4 or 5 steps. Getting down I had to turn around and crawl dangling my foot till it reached bottom. I really wish I had taken photos of the privies! Tonight, the privy was over a pile of rocks in front of the shelter over to a little bridge that you walked to another pile of rocks to the privy. There were 3 VERY high steps, again, that I had to climb up, after opening the privy door and nearly climbing on my hands and knees to get in.
I had another tough night of sleeping but didn't get up so many times.  Only 2, I think.  I used the liner as a pillow and got inside my sleeping bag, but I still slid around and felt the rocks under the pad.  But I was well rested and ready to attempt our last leg of 7 miles up through Dahlgren Camp Ground to Turners Gap where Jack's vehicle was waiting for us.  We were up by 6am, took down camp and went carefully down to the shelter.  Most of the other hikers had left by the time we came down to start breakfast.  We were aiming for a 7am start as we had so far to go but that wasn't happening.  We were all fussing at Jack about not drinking enough and having enough food.  He said he had a good night's rest in the shelter and again went off well before the rest of us.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594317,"Lionel was concerned with us (especially me) and determined to stay behind us all for the day so he wouldn't have to wait for us to catch up several times like he did the day before. Fahmah was the last to take down his tent, the last to eat breakfast, and the last to use the privy! We left the shelter around 10am. It was quite confusing where the trail up to the AT was met by other trails and we had to be sure to take the right way. Jack went wrong at first and had to turn around and Klip showed him the way, then waiting for the two of us and led us out. Once on the AT it was a steep incline for a while then a rocky trail up and down. We went from 1000ft elevation to 1600ft elevation in about 4 miles, then it was a very steep down hill, 700ft drop in 3 miles. It began raining, which was in the forecast. We put our pack covers on but the rain was so refreshing and it was so hot (high 80s) we didn't put our jackets on (except Fahmah of course). Lionel & Fahmah were ever so patient with me, not pushing me but encouraging me all the way. Jack stayed ahead of us nearly all the way. Finally the rain cleared and it got hot and humid again. We rested, ate snacks, walked on. We met and were passed by many hikers. Lots of NOBO thru hikers and many day hikers (a few families of Chinese or Japanese, walking fast and carrying umbrellas when it rained!) They passed us and then met us on their return trips. It was funny. We stopped for lunch at White Rock Cliffs, but didn't have much of a view. We were a bout a week late for the peak flowering of the Mountain Laurel which had lined the trail all the day before and in spots today. We passed the tower road (I didn't even see it) and hiked on, determined to make that 7mile hike. My pack had increased in weight just from the dampness of everything and my knees were really starting to bother me, but I hiked on, relying on those hiking poles as extra legs and relying on the support from Above.
We were about 2 miles before where the car was parked.  Klip was concerned for Jack and left us to go to the car and check on him.  We hiked on.  As we approached the high tension crossing Klip was standing waiting for us.   As we got there, we saw Jack sitting on the ground and 2 other hikers with him.  The other two hikers had happened on Jack as he was crawling to get off the trail.  He had fallen a couple times and skinned his knees.  He was just too weak to stand up and was white as a ghost.  They had called for rescue and Jack was to be evacuated as a medical emergency.  
We extend a sincere thank you to the volunteer fire and rescue squad of Boonsboro, MD.   We waited as they approached on 4 wheelers (about an hour wait) and carefully walked Jack to the 4 wheeler and took him out.  We visited with the 2 hikers that had called for rescue for Jack.  A sincere thank you to them too.   They were both retired military and just happens, this was their 4th evacuation since they started in Ga this year.  They knew just what to do.  They were both veteran hikers too, and had spent many trips on the AT and knew all the people we knew, Baltimore Jack, Bob Peoples, Miss Janet, and all and had attended most of the Trail Days that we had.  It was amazing.
Jack was transported to the Medical Center in Hagerstown MD.  They hydrated him, ran tests and determined that due to the extreme exercise, dehydration, and many other factors he was putting extreme pressure on his kidneys.  They treated and kept him overnight and released him mid afternoon the next day.   We went to the hospital and brought him back to the hotel.  We offered him a room overnight, but being stubborn, and wanting to get back home to No Carolina to work on Wednesday, he decided to leave that evening after studying the map and finding a way to avoid Washington DC and Richmond.  He found a way, drove for about 4 hours and stayed overnight and arrived at home on Tuesday around 4:30.
Jack had given us his keys and we hiked the remaining 2 miles out to Turner's Gap and I kissed the van as I was so happy to reach it!!  I drove to where my car was parked and Tony took over driving Jack's vehicle.   We arrived back at the hotel and thanked God for our safe travels and the many good people along the way.
On a side note, I hadn't used my phone much except to take pictures, keeping it on airplane mode.  When I sat at the hotel and opened my phone, I noticed the date.  It was June 10th.  That was my sister, Janice's birthday.   Janice was my best friend and took this whole AT journey right along with me in every way.  She rode with me the first time we dropped Fahmah off at Springer Mtn. and 2 other times we dropped him off.  She listened to all the stories over the last 10 years and rejoiced with us in all.  She encouraged me and was with me all the way in my losing weight, getting healthy and having as one of my goals to hike on the AT with Tony.  I was overwhelmed with joy as I thought how happy and proud she would have been to know I had finally accomplished that.  I wanted to tell her all about it more than anything else.  I will be able to tell her one day, I know.","Crampton Gap Shelter

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594320,"Monday we rested and waited to hear from Jack what was happening. We got the news and went to pick him up. Like I said, he wanted to head home that night, which he did. The guys decided to skip up to Pennsylvania, Waynesboro, and continue hiking north. We registered at the Days Inn. What a beautiful little town they have. There is one part that is new and lots of McDonalds, Burger King, Walmart, Applebees, and all that stuff, but the western section is the old section with beautiful old buildings that make it look like Europe. That is where the Days Inn is located. They decided around 2 pm to take a walk on the AT. I brought them to the Maryland border (nearly), to Pen Mar Rd and they hiked north about 2.5 miles. It was typical of PA, rocks, rocks, and more rocks. It was a beautiful day, though and they enjoyed the hike. I picked them up at PA 16, about 5 miles out of town. We slept well and walked through town in the morning to find a real breakfast. We found Christine's up the street from the hotel, and had an absolutely delicious breakfast. 
I dropped them off at the trail around 11 am and they hiked north. I headed home to Templeton. Well satisfied with my accomplishment and ready for some relaxing and healing from my hike. I arrived home around 8:30 Wednesday night. AT was very happy to see his momma!!
They had planned a 3-day hike in to Fayetteville, PA. I dropped off their supplies for the next leg at the Scottish Inn there. I registered them for Friday.
I heard from Fahmah that they had hiked 8 miles including the trail to the Tumbling Run Shelter. And last night, the 14th, they made it to Rocky Mtn Shelter, after a 6 1/2mile hike.
Today, Friday, the 15th, they are all registered at the Scottish Inn/Rite Spot Motel.  The hike out today was some up hill, but a long, rocky, long trail down.  They are both tired and ready for a rest up.  Plans will be made for their next leg.
Stay tuned for more.

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594502,"On the 15th the guys had hiked in to Fayetteville and stayed at the Scottish Inn/Rite Spot Motel. Klip said it sucked there and they only stayed one night. The hiked out on Saturday, arrived early at Quarry Gap Shelter. They were both impressed with the shelter and how nicely maintained it was. Even flowers, fresh and watered. 
Klip texted that he was frustrated this morning . They had got up at 6am and at 9am Fahmah was still “fluffing” around. Fahmah called me at around 11am. They had been on the trail over an hour and Klip told him it was time to call me. He seemed like he was in a good mood. They were going about 8 miles to the Birch Run Shelter tonight. I haven’t heard from him yet. There is probably no phone service there. 
One thing I hadnt mentioned.  Back at home when we were getting ready to leave, Fahmah picked up his pack and a piece of fabric on the back of his pack had come unglued. He couldn’t use it like that.  We had one of Klip’s old packs here and Fahmah used that and is still. It is working, but it’s made for a larger person than Tony, causing a nasty rub on his butt.  I found some fabric glue at Walmart today and I have his pack repaired   I may be making a trip down sooner than I had planned   Waiting to hear from them.
Happy Fathers Day to all the Dads out there.

Fahmah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594960,"This entry will include several days. They left Fayetteville and hiked (2.5m) to Quarry Gap Shelter and hiked to Birch Run (7.4m) then to Toms Run Shelter (6.2) to Pine Grove Furnace to a camping spot (3.7m). Yesterday they were at Tag Run Shelter (7.2m) and today hiked 8.1 miles in to Alec Kennedy Shelter. They are just 4 miles from Boiling Springs but there is not any choice for lodging except for a pricey B&B. Carlisle, PA is not far from there and that appears to be where they plan to stay. They are both SO READY for a couple of ZERO days to rest their old bones. Since I left them, other than the stinky place in Fayetteville, they have been in tents or shelters. They have really earned a day or two to rest up. Tomorrow they will hike in to Boiling Springs and hopefully get a good breakfast (Fahmah said he doesn’t have a breakfast for tomorrow but he does have coffee and granola bars), pick up his box at the post office and call for a shuttle to take them in to Carlisle. Thanks to Fahmah fluffing around again, they didn’t leave till 11am. They got to the shelter after 8pm tonight. They luckily had cell service and Fahmah called. He was going to sleep in the shelter. Klip said there were bugs in the shelter, Fahmah said no! He was too tired to cook and planned to go to bed without eating.He called me a pill pusher when I reminded him to take his pills. He also told me he met a hiker at the shelter when they first got there that lived near us and knew many people from Templeton. Such a small world on the Trail. Duncannon is only 25.7 miles away. I will be going down to stay at the Doyle with them. Klip tells me the Doyle is an institution of the Appalachian Trail. This could be my only chance to experience it. I am also bringing Fahmah’s own pack to him now that it is repaired and bring their next resupply for the next leg of their trip.  Looking forward to a shower and a comfortable bed tomorrow so the old guys can get a well deserved rest.  Then on to Duncannon
