Forded 2 streams!

Learned to go where shallowest and slowest. Both were below my knees. Flat rocks are slick, stick to smaller one. Shuffle feet.

Photos-trailhead. North Pond with island. Big Wilson Falls-impressive. Train track-active!

Shaw’s comradery at breakfast was heartwarming. There were at least 10 NOBOs.

The last .7 uphill to lean-to was taxing. Overall need to drink more-feet cramped when I put my socks and shoes on after fording. Also hand is cramping writing.

Motivation-thinking how the Wild Boars soccer team 11-17 year old trapped in a cave for 11 days then found and rescued buy scuba diving out. The photo of them when 1st found shows them smiling and upbeat. Amazing.

1st 1/3 woods walk 2nd 1/3 some rocks 3rd 1/3 fording.

I don’t have hiker’s legs, not by a long shot!

Backpack about 28 lbs is too heavy.

Blueberries!

Sleeping will be interesting, I forgot by sleeping pad-it’s in the car trunk. Note to self, attach it 1st thing when we get to a campsite on Katahdin Ironworks Rd. 
Ted is moral and logistic support.","Monson ME 15

Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599098,"Woke about 5am a bit shivery. It was light out so I got my day started.

Photos-beaver dam just north of lean-to, yes drank that water (filtered of course). Cloud Pond with tent. Barren Ledges-great view worth the rock scramble to get up there. Barren Mt. fire tower. Cloud Pond sunset.

Starting to cloud when I arrived. Hope it doesn’t rain.

Drank more today and felt less fatigued. Long day tomorrow, need to pace myself.

Fair amount of rock scrambling. 
Full shelter and tent sites, .4 mile off trail and packed! Sleeping with my food. No good trees and so many people, no one bear bagged that I could see. I love camping near a body of water, so peaceful.","Wilson Valley lean-to
",Cloud Pond lean-to,"Aug 12, Sun",8.70
Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599101,"Slept will, woke about 4 at 1st light. Snuggled down and got up at 5ish. Out at 6:15 (new speed record) to hike the .4 mile to the AT.

Fourth Mountain never ended! Not bouldering but big steps. Trail is really maintained, new cuts thru the woods where the old path is eroded. Nice and soft on the feet.

Crazy bouldering coming down from Chairback. Butt slides and lots of hesitation and planning where to step/slide next. The trail was well blazed and easy to spot each time I had to plan my next 10 foot descent.

Great views, tried and failed at a panorama shot. Need to practice before hitting the trail.

Drank enough today. Even made a .4 mile out and back to a pond for water about 2 miles from my end point.

Only once did gravity get a grip on my pack. I quickly grabbed a jutting rock and hoisted myself up.

Ted met me at KI road and I slack packed to the river-nice. Camping here in the car camping monster tent. Ted was here last night.

I attached the sleeping pad to my pack. Taking only ½ of Great Expectations-I am enjoying it-should have read it in junior high. Dropped the long sleeve shirt too and the yogurt FLAVORED (ugh) raisins. Ted will record me fording the West Branch of the Pleasant River. Pressure is on!

So far no falls, just one lean on a tree and a few stumbles caught with my trekking poles. New pen, the old one I had to stop after ever line or two, undo it and blow the ink down.

Fighter jet buzzed the mountain, scared me, reflexively ducked it sounded to close. Local fellow said they buzz his house in Monson. Thank goodness I wasn’t concentrating on bouldering, I might have lost my grip. 
Moose!  Ted had been saying that yesterday he was hoping for a moose since the campsite is near the river. We were chatting and I looked over and there was a full grown male moose! Took photos and we watched it as it watched us and ate. We moved closer to the river on a path behind the tent. Sure enough the moose started coming towards us. It had nodded its head prior to moving. We went back to the tent and watched as the moose went right by where we were. We were ready to hop in the car if he came out of the water. Very cool.

Ted had all sorts of food for me-salad, fruit and sandwich fixings all very much appreciated and yummy.","Cloud Pond lean-to
",West Branch Pleasant River ,"Aug 13, Mon",11.20
Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599104,"Sitting here in the tent because a) it’s breezy and I wet with sweat so yes, a bit cold and b) occasional spits of rain. Here’s hoping tomorrow is not raining. If it is I will have a very slow and cautious day.

Videoed on cell phone me fording the river. Not too cold thank goodness. Fording was a fear of mine but it has been dry so the streams are low and slow moving. I now have another accomplishment under my belt!

Easy walk except for the 1 mile up Gulf Hagas Mt. Just steep and easy footing, LOTS of stone steps. MATC has done a ton of work, newly cut trail, newish well leveled steps, new blazes and new large privies.

There is no way I could do this without Ted’s support-mostly emotional. He seems to have too much confidence in me. I bet he’s looking at the Spot and wondering why I stopped! I’m wiped out-hope I have more energy tomorrow. Whenever we have hiked and taken a zero I am worthless the next day. Too much time to dwell on the negatives and heavy with too much food, both in me and on my back!

Controlled fall bringing 3+ liters of water up from the spring. Nothing hurt just feeling stupid.

Tomorrow will be 3 steep ups, the last one 1 mile. And then of course are the downs which can be just as hard for me, large boulders and on the opposite end of the spectrum loose gravel that gives me fits. I try to be cognizant of nose over toes to keep my center of gravity where it belongs!","West Branch Pleasant River 
",Sidney Tappan campsite,"Aug 14, Tue",7.40
Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599105,"Wow-made better time than I thought. Woke up with energy. 
Perched here at my tent site letting everything dry.

White Cap Mt was a long 1 mil up. Took an few camera photos and tried to hustle myself across the open rocks. The sky was getting darker and no tress in sight. Timing is everything, showered just as I arrived and the Logan Brook lean-to.

Work crew out at the lean-to (I keep wanting to call them shelters). Three employees and 3 volunteers. They were working on stone steps. Coming down White Cap there had to be over 100! One of the employees lives in the town next to mine! We’ll look for each other on our nearby trails. 
Glad I decided not to push on yesterday, getting older and wiser, have nothing to prove to anyone!

The rain lasted only about 30 minutes but enough to soak me then the drips and drops from the vegetation I brushed against. Watched my footing and went slowly. Thank goodness I was off the stone steps and just on rocks and roots. The steps were level, so I probably would have stayed upright.

ABBAed my way up White Cap, Carly Simon just didn’t have enough pep. Thank you, Gary and Jesse, for helping this dinosaur load music on my MP3.

No view of Katahdin from the viewpoint as the clouds had rolled in. I’ll see it soon enough.

Guess I’m glad I didn’t know the weather forecast when I left. I hate hiking in the rain and on wet rocks and roots. But-I did it and didn’t fall.

I must reek, the files are circling me.","Sidney Tappan campsite
",East Branch Pleasant River lean-to ,"Aug 15, Wed",9
Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599106,"What a great day. Ted met me at the 1st road crossing. He had super news, Carla, Adam, Gary and Jesse will be arriving Friday to summit Saturday with me! I couldn’t have done the AT without all their help and support, especially Ted’s.

Sitting here at an established campsite on Johnson Pond at a picnic table digesting a huge dinner. It is difficult to imagine a rain soaked 18 mile hike tomorrow.

Saw a spruce grouse. It popped out of the blueberry patch I was deberrying, spread its tail feathers and slowly moved off into the shrubs away from where it came.

Today’s walk was mostly a woods walk, the one up was Little Boardman with many false summits. I move faster even when I know it is not the true top of the mountain when I see daylight. Just getting to the next switchback is a victory. 
Tried breathing only thru my nose to adjust my pace so I don’t wear myself out. Seemed to have worked. Three more days of backpacking then 1 slackpack then Katahdin. Section hikes within a section hike.

Kahtahin-1st look at is was on the road into Baxter State Park. It was an OMG moment, it is HUGE. Ranger at the Information Center said he has climbed it about 15 times in the dark on rescues. He suggested coming down the Hamblin Trail if we have time as it adds at least an hour, better footing and views than what I had planned to come down the Saddle Trail. I don’t like heights. Should be a mental and physical challenge.","East Branch Pleasant River lean-to 
",Jo-Mary Road,"Aug 16, Thu",11.80
Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599107,"What a difference a day makes. Everything is soaked. Rain started at 9 and continued on and off till about 2:30. Two times were a complete drenching downpour including some thunder and lightning. Antlers Campsite has nice views, but I guess I was expecting sites closer to the water. Any campsite on a lake is special. Got turned around a bit there, had to go back to the directional sign to realign myself. I took my eyes off the blazes while checking out the campsite. Wasn’t hungry at the Potaywadjo Spring lean-to but got some beautiful spring water and made an orange crush after gulping that clear water. At that time I had started to dry out and the sun peeked thru. The rain was supposed to last all day. I started after that short break.

Stepped in muck up to my calves and smelled like a swamp. The 2nd downpour helped a bit by washing my pants, but socks and boots were still gross and stinky. When I could smell that swampiness on me it just made me mad, stupid to try to step thru such a big bog instead of finding a way around. I do try not to widen the trails around mud and water, attempting to stay on the rocks and wood. 
Finally had to stop and eat about 3 miles from the lean-to, steps were getting smaller an I had to take a break going up a hill (not a mountain by any stretch!). By then the rains had pretty much ended. Need to take care of the body.

Lots of walking around lakes, low clouds and pine covered shores were pretty.

In summary I didn’t fall, a few slips and slides however. I did not enjoy my day.","Jo-Mary Road
",Wadleigh Stream lean-to,"Aug 17, Fri",17.80
Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599109,"Last evening, I rinsed myself and my clothes and hung them up not anticipation rain, Surprise, thunderstorm right overhead woke me up. Listened to the patter of rain and figured at least my clothes would be cleaner. They were very wet before I went to bed, so I wasn’t going to sleep with them in the tent. 
Woke late and took my time packing the wet tent. Delayed as long as possible putting on cool damp clothes. Had dry socks but boots were wet. Figured I’d treat my feet and hopefully not get blisters.

I knew I had an up but it didn’t seem that big on the elevation profile. Guess my long wet yesterday took its toll. Lots of roots and rocks today. Only the last 2 miles were what I consider easy. Tomorrow I have a 1 ½-2 mile up, I’ll be prepared!

Drying my wet gear, airing my puckered feet and enjoying the sun at the campsite, can’t see the lake though. When I fetched water a loon was swimming and diving. First one I’ve seen this year. One fall today, slipped on an insignificant small stone and lost my balance. Lack of concentration.

Swelling and redness on my left ankle seem to be decreasing, Attributing it to some really itchy bug bites.

I don’t have the stamina of a few years ago. It affects my mood knowing I am showing my age. Why does my pack seem to weigh more after lunch? I don’t have the jubilation I thought I would with being so close to finishing. It has been a hard hike even with Ted meeting me every 3rd day. Getting the AT done was once a dream but became a chore. I had trepidations of this year. Perhaps part is my lack of conditioning and my lack of discipline in preparation to hike daily with a pack as I had said I would, part the daily solitude and the nerves of climbing Katahdin.

OK. Bad way to end an entry.

Sitting lakeside now after dinner and feeling refreshed. I am doing what I want, am basically able to do so and have the support of a loving husband that has made this possible. I am lucky. There, better!","Wadleigh Stream lean-to
",Rainbow Lake campsite,"Aug 18, Sat",11.90
Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599111,"Sunny, not too warm and met Ted on the trail. Woke around 4:45 to full sunshine, privied, then did something I haven’t done, got back in my sleeping bag! Decided to get up at 5:15. Had breakfast and heard the loon! Can you believe-55 degrees and my lizard self is in short sleeves. Disclaimer, I started out of the tent in 2 shirts, fleece and rain jacket for warmth.

Atop Rainbow Ledges had a big handful of blueberries. A SOBO told me there were bushels of them up there. Also had cell reception so called Jesse to ask him to bring extra gear for Katahdin.

Crossing Hurd Brook was interesting, huge rock scramble type boulders. Not sure I found the easiest way but I stayed dry. Sure wouldn’t want to start my day trying to get across. It takes me a good 20 minutes to warm up the muscles. Yesterday had to take off the pack because I couldn’t climb over a fallen tree nor duck under it without fearing I’d fall face first in the deep mud. Just like Mahoosic Notch! These times make a woods walk more interesting.

The red squirrels at Hurd Brook lean-to are little beggars, must be fed by amused hikers. Had my quick lunch and privy break and on to the home stretch.

Ted was sitting on a log waiting for me about ½ mile from the bridge. He filled me in on the new plans since the AT Lodge does not shuttle NOBO’s to Katahdin Stream. He booked a campsite for Friday night in Baxter State Park. Saturday all the parking spots at Katahdin Stream were booked, the only other option was to get to the gate around 5:30am Saturday, wait in line till 7 and hope someone didn’t show for their reserved spot. Ted is a logistic genius. 
Sitting on a soft bed, clean and in 100% cotton! Looking forward to eating dinner at a table. Surprised I’m not more nervous about Katahdin.","Rainbow Lake campsite

Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599112,"The rest of the family arrived after an all-night car ride. Ted arranged for an extra hour at the motel so they could take a quick shower before we headed to the campground. 
Stopped for last minute supplies at $ Tree, visited Baxter State Park headquarters in Millinocket and traced our fingers on the relief map. The rangers have been very informative and helpful. Got to the campsite around 2, set up (it is a walk-in campsite but there are wagons to use for the 800’ from the parking lot to the campsite), and bought firewood. 
Moose at Grassy Pond! Carla and I took a short walk in the woods while Ted and Adam shuttled a car to the Roaring Brook Campground where we would be ending tomorrow. We decided to check out the pond as our turn around point. There low and behold was a reddish moose feeding a little way away in the pond. 
Back at camp we fixed dinner, ramen with canned veggies and black beans (Carla’s idea for the additions). Everyone enjoyed dinner and the fire. Gary had brought a ton of snacks to share. We had a blast picking and choosing while Gary made customized trail mixes for everyone. 
We all went to bed around 9. I think everyone fell asleep fairly quickly. Big day tomorrow.","

Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599116,"All smiles and excitement at the trailhead. Photos and a see you at the hotel to Ted. He was going back to break camp and then relax at the hotel.

The first part of the hike is a woods walk no different from any other. Then it gets a bit steeper, Still below treeline and not too strenuous. We 1st lunched at a spot with an opening in the trees and a great view. We could not have asked for a better day. We were still smiling.

Above treeline it was a different kind of hike. Bouldering and more bouldering. I don’t like heights so I just kept looking up. One hand rail and 2 foot rails were strategically placed. Still needed a boost up from Gary to reach a decent hand hold. Thank goodness it wasn’t too hot because I had the fear sweat going!

2nd lunch at what I thought was the Tableland. We watched the people move/climb on the rocks ahead. BIG mistake on location! More bouldering. Such a hard climb when I thought it would get easier. Pulling myself up, stretching to reach with legs and arms, using my knee pads to brace myself and inch along. At one point I twisted my ankle and gingerly tried to put weight on it. I didn’t tell anyone since we were quite high up. After a few minutes it was better otherwise I would have stopped and taped it. I think I grew yet another grey hair imagining a worst case scenario. Quite the workout. 
The views are spectacular. Seeing the mountain range and lakes below, feeling warmth of the sun, just trying to take it all in and hoping for permanent memories.

1:00 Katahdin! A feeling of relief and gratitude. Once again, I could not have done this without my family. It was a party atmosphere by the sign. We waited in line for our photo time. Hammed it up a bit. Had 3rd lunch and chilled for about 45 minutes.

Then the down. Trails are well marked. We came down the Saddle Trail-5.5 miles to Roaring Brook. At first small rocks then the scree field. Staying to the left nearer the mountain was a safer route for me, less loose gravel. It was steep! The shrubs were getting incrementally taller and I was happy to get to treeline. We still had a long way to go but at least more secure footing.

Chimney Pond Campground, 3.3 miles to go. We were all fairly tired. Looked back and saw how for down we had come. Pretty impressive. Another long woods walk to the end, hoping each brook was Roaring Brook! Carla the Beast was the only one not exhausted.

Driving back was quiet. When we got cell reception called Ted, he quickly got to Subway just before they closed. We sat our clean selves in the bar at the motel and wolfed down our subs. Had a congratulatory beer. Said our goodnights at 10, they were planning on an early start tomorrow for the 12 hour car ride home.

Still stunned at completing Katahdin.","Katahdin Stream Campground
",Katahdin Hunt Trail to Roaring Stream Campground,"Aug 21, Tue",10.70
Appalachian Snails ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599117,"Hugs and congrats and off they went a bit after 7. Carla found the continental breakfast, we all had about 3 cups of OJ along with lots of java.

Ted dropped me off and I went off a fast for me pace. The forecast was for rain in the afternoon and I didn’t want to have to ford the Nesowandehunk Stream forks. The woods smelled of pine. Some of the trees are amazingly straight and tall-I can see how they were harvested for ship masts. There were 10 NOBOs and 1 SOBO. Hope the weather cooperated for them, sure wouldn’t want to climb Katahdin in the wet. 
Finished at Golden Road. Ted was there strolling towards me with his ubiquitous cup of DD. Nice! Photo shoot at the trailhead. Had ice cream at the Abol Bridge store as I had promised myself. One scoop each of moose tracks and deer tracks! 
It’s an accomplishment. I had my doubts this day would ever be. It used to be almost an obsession to complete the trail but for the last couple of years that has disappeared. Ted has been my safety net and had more confidence in my abilities than I have. We did this together.

 

 

Post Hike Notes:

My favorite luxury item-travel pillow case that I put over my clothing stuff sack.

I love cotton in town after hiking.

ABBA will always be my go-to for powering me uphill.

Hiker’s enthusiasm is contagious.

Best sight of all-Ted with his DD meeting me at a trailhead.

My spongy, grippy, kiddy, frog knee pads are a new must-carry.

I should have done the hard northern section of the AT first, age didn’t make hiking easier. 
My confidence was shattered a few years ago. Injuries, too many falls, the disappearance and subsequent discovery of  Geraldine ""Inchworm"" Largay weighed on me.  
Yes I have a spring in my step and shoulders held high thinking about ‘I did hike the AT’.","Katahdin Stream Campground
