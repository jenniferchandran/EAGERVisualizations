Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582198,I am getting ready to resume my northbound AT thru hike on 1/23/18.  I am having problems linking all my entries from last year.  Looks like my Trail name has to be mattman for 2018 rather than Mattman from 2017.  I have sent a request for help to Trailjournals to see if this can be rectified.  In the meantime I’ll start a new journal.  Will have to let all relatives and friends know to search for me under mattman with a small “m”.,,View Entry,"Jan 19, Fri",0
Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582199,I got a couple new pieces of equipment for this thru hike attempt.  I have a lightweight tarp that I’ll use in camp as a kitchen in the event of precipitation.  I can use it to set up and break down camp also if there is precip.  Eventually I plan on using it with a hammock once the weather warms.  I can then send my tent home.  I’ll get the hammock from Dutchware Gear which is in my hometown of Lancaster.  I also got a Solo alcohol stove.  A bit heavier than the tin can alcohol stove I used last year but it is more stable and has a lid that allows left over alcohol to stay in the stove till next time rather than having to burn it all off for transport.,,View Entry,"Jan 19, Fri",0

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582207,It appears my prior entries about logging into my 2018 journal are incorrect.  It appears that searching using Mattman or mattman brings up 2 choices; one for my 2017 journal and one for this 2018 journal.  Thus you can view both last year and this year’s journals using the same Trail name with a capital “M” or lower case “m”.  My picture does not show yet on the 2018 journal search but that is because the site managers have to edit it to make it fit.  It should show in a few days.  Will compose an entry about any further technical issues.  The picture is of the barracks where I stayed while taking the Wilderness First Responder course at Bucknell University in central PA earlier this month.  I felt it was a good idea to have some background on how to deal with backcountry emergencies.  I actually had a dream last night about using what I learned!,,View Entry,"Jan 19, Fri",0
Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582226,"I mistakenly have been referring to my hike as a thru-hike.  Someone pointed out this is not correct.  That is correct, this will be a section hike albeit a rather unorthodox one if I make it the whole way.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Sat",0
Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582376,Second day.  Don’t get good cell reception.  Cold up here so a short entry.  Saw 2 Peliated woodpeckers today. 4 other day hikers so far.,"Low Gap

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582412,"Tough night.  Windy and cold.  My water bottles froze—not solid but close.  Difficult getting started in the cold this morning.  Beautiful day now.  I am eating lunch at the Swag of the Blue Ridge—love the names given to mountains, gaps etc.  Planning on staying at Deep Gap Shelter tonight.  Saw 7 people yesterday but none so far today.  All 7 we’re going southbound and were either day or section hiking.  I am having second thoughts about this.  So cold and lonely.  I’ll see how long I can hold on.  I really think I made a mistake starting so early.","On a ridge before Tray Mt Shelter

Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582441,"I have now given up on a long 2,000 mile hike.  I just don’t want to be away that long.  I started this year feeling like I had to do this rather than really wanting to do it.  That’s not a good mindset.  I’ll now be a happy section hiker up and down the trail and trail magic deliverer in PA!
Winter hiking is difficult for a number of reasons and I just don’t want to deal with it anymore.  The pack is heavier, it’s harder to do tasks, etc.
The first two nights out the wind howled all night making it hard to sleep.  I made a mistake the second night while missing a campsite at the Cheese Factory (those evocative names again!) and ended up camped in my tent on a ridge line.  Burr!  My toes were cold and my water bottles froze!
Worse than that was the loneliness.  It was almost 2 days that I didn’t see a soul and it would have been another day or so I think if I had continued past Dicks Creek Gap on to the NC line.
The worst aspect of this hike, and the one that finally pushed me to leave, was that it is so BORING!  There is nothing of interest. Dead leaves on the trail and a barren landscape that all looks the same (no duh, right?).  Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice country but it’s SLEEPING, as should I.  The most interesting thing I saw were a couple Peliated woodpeckers (Woody Woodpeckers!).  I did hear coyotes last night and a hooting owl.  
The one positive that I’ve gotten out of this short trip (other than almost finishing Georgia) is meeting some really great shuttle folks.  This will enable me to drive to GA and NC, park, hike for a week or so and get a ride back to my car.  Sally and Joyce are retired and live in Hiawassee GA.  They run shuttles from north Atlanta to Fontana Dam at the south entrance to Smoky Mt NP.  I was able to call Them last night from my campsite at Deep Gap Shelter while sitting in front of a campfire (I also made plane and hotel reservations).  Cell coverage had been spotty but worked from that spot.
Sally picked me up at Dicks Creek Gap and drove me to the North Springs MARTA station in Atlanta. We had a wide ranging and very entertaining discussion in the car.  It made the 2 hour drive fun even.  She and Joyce moved to Hiawassee to retire close to 20 years ago and live on a nice property just outside of town.  We drove by it and she pointed it out.  They will even let one keep their car there if section hiking.  They garden, take canoe trips to the Suwannee River in GA and FL or Boundary Waters in MN and shuttle hikers in the busy season (I am definitely not in the busy season).  I’ve met a lot of really wonderful folks who run these shuttles.  
Anyway, once I decided to cut this hike short I started to formulate my section hiking plans and having such shuttles will make it easier.  I am at peace with all this and hope to be back in GA and/or NC in either the spring or fall.  I’ve hiked the Smokies in the spring and it is beautiful.  Maybe I can find some folks at home who would like to join me.
Stay tuned, I’ll keep posting!",,Home,"Jan 26, Fri",4
Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582457,I stayed at a hotel near the Atlanta airport last night and have now arrived home.  I think I forgot to mention in my posting last night why I stupidly started so early.  I’m a huge soccer fan and wanted to finish the hike (wherever on the trail) by the start of the World Cup in mid-June.  I realized on the first day hiking on Tuesday how unrealistic I was being.  Oh well!  Section hikes coming this spring.,,Home,"Jan 27, Sat",0
Mattman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586921,"I did a section last week from 4/9/18 to 4/13/18 from Dicks Creek Gap in Georgia to Tellico Gap in North Carolina.  This was a distance of about 59 miles and this combined with the 3 days from last March and 4 days this January adds up to 130 miles covered on the AT so far.
I uploaded a bunch of photos with  some pretty long explanations on them.  I have the advantage of taking my time on these entries to research the plants pictured and to give a bit more background.  I could not make entries while on the trail because I only had phone coverage up high on the mountaintops or high ridge lines and the camps were usually too low to get reception.  Please check out these photos.
My plan this hike was to complete 2, 100 mile sections.  I vastly overestimated my abilities and underestimated how difficult the North Carolina AT is.  I was only able to average 12 miles a day.  This was about what the majority of the other thru hikers I was hiking with covered per day.  I realized I would not be able to get all the way to Hot Springs NC (north of the Smokies) by the time I hoped.  That was one reason I stopped at Tellico Gap.  
Another is a recurring problem I have with my hip.  I’m quite concerned with this.  My left thigh starts to go numb partway into a hike—usually 3 or 4 days in.  This time it started on the first day.  My doctor told me in the past it is because of a nerve at the top of my hip that is getting pinched by the backpack hip belt.  My solution was to loosen the hip belt and let the weight be carried by my shoulders which is contrary to the entire idea of the weight being carried by one’s hips.  I did call ULA (company of my pack) and the guy suggested I need a larger pack belt so hopefully that will help once it arrives.
The terrain in NC and on the AT so far for me has been tough.  So many of the gradients are steep.  There are not many gradual switch backs, instead the steep trails lead to excessive erosion with a lot of gnarly tree roots polished smooth by thousands of feet. 
The worst aspect again for me has been the boring nature of the trail up high around 4,000 to 5,000 feet.  In spite of the various flower pictures I got, not much is happening up high yet.  It makes for a sameness through the day that I find numbing.
Anyway, sorry about this long post.  I’m doing all my entries at once for the 5 days.
I got a hammock and tarp and used it on this section.  It worked OK but I do need to get an under quilt rather than using my Thermarest pad.  
I did meet a lot of interesting people.  There was Chris from Stockholm Sweden (funny cat), Jason from Connecticut, Austler from Rome (he went to Lincoln U in PA on a soccer/track scholarship and we got to talk soccer!), Springbok and Dandelion from South Africa (they have a journal on this site), Bleep (so known because she cusses a lot, she is putting video on YouTube under The Adventures of Michelle Strong—I’m in one of her videos, I show up at about the 20 minute mark of her Trail Update 3 titled “We ran out of water”—very funny stuff) an older fellow from Columbus OH who is hiking with another adult (his wife I think) and some high school students going from Springer Mt GA to Hot Springs NC and the high schoolers will get credit and write a report and do a presentation to the school about their hike.  Great people!
I’ll come back to where I left off at Tellico Gap in the future but intend to make it in May or in the fall.
I told a lot of the thru hikers I met last week that I hope to see them in PA when I day hike and hand out trail magic!  This will be in late May and into June when the bubble of thru hikers is going through PA.  Something to look forward to.  I’ll put entries for that like last year.   I also will be going to the Beartooth Wilderness for a backpacking trip in August with Big Wild Adventures.  More to look forward to!  I’ll likely make a separate entry for that trip once I return home.
Stay in the trees!","Dicks Creek Gap
