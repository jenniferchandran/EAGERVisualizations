Worried/hopefull. Spent the hours meticulously weighing my gear...yes that’s a thing in backpacking circles. I’ve learned a lot reading gear lists posted online by other hikers so my stuff is listed here for others to refer to. (click “gear” in the menu). Everything I’m taking, sans food and water, weighs in at 21 lbs. That’s pretty dang good, and will ease the stress on my knees.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583125,"It was a foggy, rainy, muddy, glorious day! I’m finally here at the top of Springer Mountain, in a wet cloud. Cool but not cold, record high temps for next few days. Most of today’s walking was on the “Approach Trail” so after 9.1 miles I’m camping at AT trail mile 0.3. Long way to go! My bad knee is not performing up to needed specs, lots of pain. That’s quite worrisome but I don’t have any control over it except to keep the daily mileage low and hope for the best. There’re a few peeps camping here tonite, all of us headed for Maine. We ate dinner together and had an enjoyable chat. They are: Marbles (from Texas I think). Georgia and Nick from Australia. Plodalong and Grandma Shortie from Massachusetts (they’re posting their hike on YouTube). John from Tabernackle, NJ. He’s the just retired DPW Supervisor of Medford...holy cows, just like me...incredible! He looks a bit familiar, I’m sure we’ve crossed paths. There’s another guy who’s name I forgot, sorry guy. I’ll call you guy. On we go...","

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583159,"Another very wet day. The sun did come out briefly at supper time drawing oohs and ahhs at the shelter. A few more people here tonite including another from Jersey. Australians Georgia and Nick got soaked and had a mouse chew into their tent last night. They were last seen headed out the way we came. I hope they’re just regrouping. I asked them if it rains much in their hometown, they said “maybe 2-3 times a year”. It’s gonna rain every day here for at least another week. Yikes! Keeping the miles low, planning about 8 tomorrow. I have supplies for 2 more nights.
Corrections from yesterday: Marbles is from NC and “guy” is Music Man from GA.","

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583231,"A nice warm partly sunny day. It was needed to dry out my stuff. I can’t believe how lucky we hikers are to have this first week be so warm. Even the wet first days were a blessing in disguise forcing us to learn learn efficient set up and beak down. Early this afternoon just as I was getting hungry I had my first Trail Magic! Snap and Lion-heart, “Class of 2017” thru hikers, were paying it forward at Cooper gap with an AWSOME spread. I filled up on fruits, veggies, and a doughnut.","

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583260,"9 hours walking up and down on this warm, sunny Georgia day. I’ve  spent each night so far at the shelter sites with the same several people. We see each other occasionally through the day but mostly we walk alone. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) has lots of “Ridge Runners” here in Georgia, ran into 3 of them today. They make sure people follow the rules, especially with regards to carrying out trash and storing food properly. Kudos to them as the sites are in good shape. There are metal boxes at each shelter to store food overnight. Last night coyotes made some noise close by but stayed out of flashlight range. Big day tomorrow, gotta get up and over Blood Mountain. They say it’s as tough as it’s name but it doesn’t stand a chance: there’s a shower, laundry, and a bed on the other side!
As I’m typing this, at 8:30 pm, a big group of people arrived. Everybody is settled in and they’re tromping about in the dark  looking for flat spots to set up their tents...I hope they cook and store their food properly or say hello to Mr Coyote!","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583287,"Blood Mountain whaaaa? Kicked it’s butt, so did all the other thru hikers. Staying tonight at Mountain Crossings hostel. I wasn’t the first one here but I was the first one to ask for a bunk and BINGO: Trail Magic again! Someone anonymously payed the $20 for today’s first hiker’s bunk, I proudly took the prize and some ribbing from my fellow travelers. There was a small festival here sponsored by the outfitter, they call it the “Kick Off” of hiking season. There were a few vendors, live music, and hot dogs. The Altra shoe rep gave me a beer (I’m wearing his shoes). The rumored laundry service proved to be just that but no matter, it’s gonna rain hard tomorrow. There are a surprising number of hikers around, 12 here and at least another couple dozen at a near by campsite and the hostel down the road. Eight (give or take) of us have formed a little group traveling at the same pace. I think we’ll begin to break up as each of our need for rest and showers spreads us out along the route. We’ll all no doubt form new groups, everybody’s going the same way!

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583347,"Cold rain today. More rain tomorrow morning then still colder. Got more Magic at a road crossing. Billy was parked there with fresh fruit and a hot cup of Lady Grey tea. Thanks Billy! Lots of people in and around the shelter tonite although we’re spread over about 1/10 mile of slimy muddy trail. There is no “bear box” for food storage here and the trees are not conducive to hanging my bag so I sealed my food up as best I could. It’s laying right here under my hammock with my wet and stinky shirt, socks, and underwear laying on top. That ought’a to do the trick. There’s a dog in the shelter for back up. Marbles and I have been hiking near each other since the start. I pass him on the uphills and he passes me going down. We’ve agreed to stay that way until at least the next hostel, three days away. Rumor has it they do laundry...","Neels Gap
",Low Gap shelter,"Feb 25, Sun",11.50
Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583378,"Morning rain gave way to sunshine and it’s clear and cold tonite. The moon is bright enough to read by but I didn’t pack a book: too heavy! Marbles and I have become separated. He was beginning to struggle and may have gone into town for a “zero day” (zero miles, day of rest). I’m sure he’ll be fine and we’ll see each other further north. Everyone in the group I started with is now ahead of me, behind me, or headed home. 
Here tonite are Blaze and Mike, who I’ve run into a few times before, two brothers who have identical clothes, a father and son with whom I compared hammocks, the Ridge-runner Pete, and his wife. The shelter has a brand new privy (joy joy) and steel “bear cables” for hanging food. Pete taught us how to properly attach our bags before hauling them 15ft up. He says the bears north of here in the Smoky Mountains have learned to shake the cables so that improperly secured food will fall to the ground...uh, whuut?!!
I’m gonna try to push through to the hostel at Dicks Creek Gap on Thursday for cleanup, resupply, and maybe a zero. I’ll need to stretch my food but I haven’t been very hungry. They say the famous “Hiker Hunger”  doesn’t kick in for a week or two, I hope it’s closer to two for me! 

Shout out to Mrs Taft’s 4th grade class at Manasquan Elementary! Please, Mrs Taft, don’t mark me too harshly on spelling and grammar, it’s cold, my typing thumbs are numb, and I haven’t enough battery for too many proofreads.","Low Gap Shelter
",Blue Mountain Shelter,"Feb 26, Mon",7.30
Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583420,"This morning I watched the sun rise over Tray Mountain, where I am tonite, pretty cool. There was magic at Unicoi Gap. This time it came in the form of a Dr. Pepper and some chips from the trunk of Darren “The Encourager’s” car. I met several people including 2017 thru hiker Lion King. All of them knew with a glance and a sniff that I’m headed for Maine. One couple offered me a beer which I politely declined (what’s happening to me?!!). 
Plodalong and Grandma Shortie are back refreshed after a luxurious night in an actual hotel. They brought news that Music Man dropped out, at lease temporarily, with a dental emergency and Marbles indeed did head to nearby Hiawassee for some rest. Among others present tonight are Blaze, Motorcycle Mama, and Maple who is sporting an impressively small pack. 
Every day I walk through many areas of blowdown (fallen trees) caused when Hurricane Irma barreled through here last year. ATC volunteers have done an amazing job clearing debris from the trail. Fellow NOBO’er (northbounder) Mike was hiking here when Irma struck. Everyone was sternly ordered off the trail. Others tell tales of destruction in their hometowns nearby. 
Ironically, as I see the damage here Joyce is in Tortola, BVI seeing massive destruction from when the same storm passed directly over that small island. She’s there making arrangements to rebuild the severely damaged getaway she recently took over from her parents. 
I noticed today that acorns are beginning to sprout. Of the countless thousands I walked past some will survive to fill the voids left by the storm.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583473,"Hard, cold rain all day. I got soaked to the bone. It’s just water though. It’ll wash off. 
As soon as I got to the shelter area I set up my tarp, hung the hammock, put on dry clothes, and took a little nap in my cozy down cocoon. Later I went to the shelter to cook dinner with the group. They’re all sleeping inside on the hard floor there while mice run over and amongst them. No thank you, I’ll stay out here with Mr. Coyote!
Trail names. Some people make up their own: Plodalong and Grandma Shortie. Some are given one because of something they do. Weatherman got his because he checks the forecast early so people ask him instead of turning on their phones to check themselves. One of the rules out here is that you have to approve your trail name. Many don’t have one.  Mike and Pete. 
Plodalong keeps trying to tag me. Romano: I packed stinky cheese from home. Freebie: I always seem to get Magic. Cathole: I was dumb enough to bring that one up, thanks George.
I’m sticking with my lifelong nickname. Come on, my MOM gave it to me! Not that I’m not profoundly proud of being given the names of my father and grandfathers; all the finest of men. In fact I hold those names in such high regard that I’ll only use them on very important occasions: graduations, wedding, legal proceedings, tax time, etc. For everything else Chip has always worked just fine. Life is kinda like a trail right? So Chip it is. 
More rain on tap for tomorrow. Just 3.6 miles to Dicks Creek Gap and the long awaited laundry day! Fingers crossed...","Tray Mountain Shelter

Rain held off till I reached the famous Top of Georgia Hostel where there was indeed laundry service. $35 dollars covers bunk, shower, laundry, shuttle into Hiawassee for dinner and supplies, breakfast tomorrow, then a ride back to the trail 1/2 mile up the road.
I ate massive heaps of salad and veggies at a buffet along with Blaze, a young man whose name eludes, and Marbles who “night hiked” in the pouring rain last night to arrive at Low Gap Shelter after 8:00. I also learned he is an excellent guitar player after he picked one up in the common area...super comfy couches there!

Today was the first day that I struggled a bit and I arrived here exhausted. My pack is heavy with 5 days of food, the trail kept going up, up, up, and the cold just sucked the energy from me. It took 9 hours including several snack breaks to make it here. 
I got a little boost from crossing the border into North Carolina. One state down, 13 to go (but who’s counting).

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583580,"Another crisp day, trail not as steep as yesterday, 8 relatively easy hours. Last night there was a guy at the shelter who seemed different. Couldn’t put my finger on it but he had an air of confidence and a bit of a Rock Star vibe. Having arrived too late for introductions it wasn’t till this morning that I learned he is Giggles: the first SOBO we’ve run into! He’s been on the trail since July and will be done in a week. I salute you sir!
Today near the top of Standing Indian Mountain I passed sign nailed to a tree. It’s been there so long the bark has begun to grow over it. It said “North Carolina Wildlife Bear Sanctuary”. I instantly recognized the font from the NC Wildlife magazines my Grandparents would subscribe to us as a holiday gift each year. Those subscriptions likely helped fund the sign. I used to read each issue cover to cover to learn about the plants and animals in these mountains, most of which are also common at home in New Jersey.
Fred and Edna Daley were good people who worked hard to provide for my mother, my aunts, and my uncles. I always thought of their home and Valley Road neighborhood in Glen Rock as a kind of Walton’s Mountain (as in the 70s TV show). A place where Father worked the earth, Mother made ends meet at home, and older siblings sometimes delayed following their dreams to care for younger ones. It was a place full of pictures and stories. A wonderful place to be a grandchild. I still see the house and yard as it was. Feel the rumble of freight trains passing at night. Smell the basement bedrooms with dark closets and mysterious cabinets filled with the last generations toys, stuffed animals, books, and games. 
There are no Daleys left on Valley Road. They moved north and south, mostly into states where this trail goes. We many grandchildren have spread wider. And so on. 
Why did they send us North Carolina Wildlife Magazine? I’ve always wondered. Although they did eventually move here it seemed a curious choice until today. Those subscriptions planted the seeds of this adventure in my young head. Thanks Fred and Edna, it was good seeing you on the mountain today.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583662,"Worked hard this morning to beat the crowd of hikers into Franklin, bad weather rolling in tomorrow and many are getting off trail to avoid it. Ron, the operator of Baltimore Jacks Hostel, managed to fit 11 of us and our gear into his 6 passenger van (he said the record is 12). I rode squished between the back seat and the rear doors with packs on top of me. It reminded me of the “pre-seatbelt” days when we’d just pile in till the doors wouldn’t shut. Ron told us some cautionary tales about how quickly the weather can go bad in these mountains and offered tips on where to shop and eat. After restocking our food bags John (formerly Weather Man, he prefers John) and I had a burger then he, Mack Daddy, and I had dinner at Hardee’s then some beers at The Lazy Hiker Brewery. Got back to the hostel way after “Hiker Midnight” which is an hour after dark. An injured hiker is sleeping in the bunk above John. He fell and cut his face on a log then hiked 20 miles to get to town. Ron took him to the clinic and he’ll be OK but the bleeding hasn’t subsided. John will surely sleep with his mouth closed. Taking my first Zero tomorrow, partly because of the weather, partly to rest my bones, and partly because I’m enjoying the company.","Long Branch Shelter

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583717,"Nasty weather here in Franklin this morning though this evening was pretty nice. A few dozen hikers spent the day lollygagging about town at the many  businesses catering to us. There are food stores, cafes, pubs, and two outfitters one of which has a craft beer bar inside next to the shoe section (George: make a note for a future surf shop).
Businesses here are gearing up, no... bracing for a “Bubble” of hikers due in starting tomorrow. “Bubble” is the term for a large group of hikers traveling on a section of trail at the same time. This bubble is made up mostly of 20 somethings who started at Springer Mountain in the sunny days the week after I started in the rain on Feb 20th. They’re putting in more miles per day than us “Greybeards” and are predictably passing through our numbers now. The biggest bubble will begin hiking over the next 3 weeks and won’t catch me till April. By then attrition will have thinned us all out so crowding shouldn’t be a problem.

Tonite’s low temperature will be about 18 with gusty winds. I’m confident my gear will suffice...toasty as I write this! The cold makes everything difficult but I’m slowly getting more efficient at setting up at night and breaking down each morning. 
At Amacalola State Park (the southern end of the trail) the ATC has a table set up  where prospective thru-hikers answer a few questions and sign in before they head up Springer Mountain. Sign in is not required and there is no fee. Each hiker is given a tag for their pack with a number on the back. I am Hiker #217. 
Of the 4000 people expected to sign in this year fewer than 1 in 4 will reach Mt. Katahdin in Maine. Several people I’ve hiked with have already left the trail. Among them: Georgia and Nick were rained out, Music Man got a bad toothache, Gabriel blew out his knee, Marbles got picked up in Franklin with a possible broken foot, Water Leaf just didn’t like climbing mountains, and today I learned John is headed home with a foot injury. I’ve enjoyed their company and wish all continued success on their journeys, on and off trail. Yesterday I heard a description of a hiking couple that sounded an awful lot like Georgia and Nick.

Instead I ate a Spam Burrito and some almonds from my food bag to lighten my load for the long, steep climb out of there.

My feet have been sore the past couple of days and around noon I felt a growing pain in one foot. I’ve seen others push through minor problems only to head home with serious injuries so I decided to get off trail a day earlier than planned. I pulled out the guidebook and called Lonnie at Wolf Creek Hostel for a pick up at the next road crossing. Within an hour I was showered and doing laundry. Swagman, Mac Daddy, and Class Act are here as well and we had dinner together at the diner next door. I’m pretty sure my foot is fine but might not have been if I went on as planned. I may have been pushing too hard and the smart thing to do is get some rest...lots of miles to go...
Denise is coming here to pick me up in the morning. I’ll spend tomorrow and Monday with her in Murphy, NC. I’ve made plans with Lonnie to spend Tuesday and Wednesday nights here at Wolf Creek while he shuttles me to and from the trail for 2 days of “Slack Packing”. Slack Packing is when you hike with just a day’s supplies and leave your gear behind or have it delivered to you up the trail.

We had a long discussion regarding the differences between Chalets, Villas, and Cabins. She thinks the difference is architectural, I think it’s more about the view. We agreed to disagree. 
Denise noted that in yesterday’s post I referred to the building where we are staying as a “house”. I am the guest here so I’ll stand corrected: it’s a “Villa”. I feel very bad now about asking her to take me to Walmart. 
At the end of the today I feel I’m getting too much civilization and am itching to get back on the trail but still convinced that the days off are needed. I start back up tomorrow with an easy 7.6 miles slack-pack to see how the foot is.

Everybody’s catching slack pack fever. At least 4 others from here are doing it tomorrow in slightly different ways. As for me: Lonnie will drop me at Yellow Creek Rd. and I’ll hike NOBO to Fontana where he’ll pick me up and bring me back here for one more night. 
On Thursday he’ll take me to Fontana where I’ll finally enter The Smokies. It doesn’t look like I can carry enough food to get through the whole Park.

It’s intimidating looking up into the Smokies from the Dam. Even though the mountain forecast is for high temps in the 40s there’s still snow up there. Some hikers are skipping ahead to avoid it.

Footing switched from slimy mud to slush to ice as I gained elevation but I managed to stay upright. There’s up to 4 inches of snow in some spots but it’s tromped down on the trail. No problems with the foot, proud of myself for dealing well with that. My pack is very heavy due to a big food load. I have enough for 6-7 days and I could make it through the park without resupply although I might decide to spend a night in Gatlinburg to break it up. 
GSMNP requires everyone to sleep in the shelters unless they are full. Latecomers sleep outside. I got here before it was full so this is my first night sleeping inside one. It’s full now and I could give up my spot and set up outside, one guy just did. I’d be more comfortable in my hammock but I’m gonna stick it out and see how well I sleep so I can decide what to do in the future. As I’m writing this more hikers are arriving.
All of the shelters are slightly different. This one has three walls with tarps hanging as a forth. It’s about 25 feet wide with two levels - actually they’re more like shelves. I’m on the bottom with about 3 feet of headroom. Because of the roof angle upstairs guests have their noses against the beams, not exactly top shelf! (Sorry, couldn’t let that one go by.) The floors have slats nailed down to designate 12 “official” sleeping spots.

This morning before first light as I was preparing to hit the trail I slipped in some mud. So fast, BAM!...down I went, landing on my left elbow and wrenching my already bad shoulder. If my elbow hadn’t touched down in the same soft mud I slipped in I’m sure I would  have broken my arm (I thought of you Bob). 
I immediately took some “Vitamin I” (Ibuprofen) to stave off inflammation and sat to assess the situation. I could: A) hike out the way I came (10mi), B) push on to Newfound Gap (30mi) and get to Gatlinburg, or C) call Super-friend Dr J Applegate in Raleigh and have him to pick me up. Backtracking didn’t appeal to me so A was out. I decided to hike on a few hours to assess the injury and see if I could make safe progress despite it. I fashioned a sling by collapsing one hiking pole and looping its hand strap over the sternum strap of my pack and headed up the mountain.
What a glorious sunny day it turned into, the finest weather so far. Snow Miser, seeing my distress, released his grip on the mountains just enough for Heat Miser to sweep up from the valleys, melt the snow, dry the mud, and lift my spirits. Those two can’t agree on everything (they’re too much) so there were some slick sections where I had to “deploy” the bad arm and 2nd hiking pole just to be safe but that was good, had to test my abilities. 
By afternoon, after checking in with Joyce, I decided to call J reasoning that I at least need some time to recover (again) and his place in Raleigh beats the best of Gatlinburg and, for heavens sake, what are Super-friends for?! I made the call and J said he’d pick me up “wherever and whenever”. He even offered to hike in and carry my pack but I declined, the weight of it doesn’t hurt my shoulder, it’s more of an upper arm injury I guess. 
The hitch is that the nearest road 17.9 miles away at Newfound Gap. All the roads between here and there are snowed in and closed until April. That’s two more days hiking and tomorrow I’ll have to climb up and over Clingmans Dome. At 6612ft it’s the highest spot on the whole Appalachian Trail. Yikes!! I’m confident I can do it albeit slowly to stay safe. I’ll preserve the bad arm for when it’s needed and I have ice cleats to put on if it gets too slippery. I lucked out tonight as the shelter was full when I arrived. I’ll get a better night of sleep in my hammock than I would have in there.
It means so much to me that Denise and J, both the very best of friends (and also the ones I’ve backpacked the most with in years past) are here to help me when I’m so far from home.
It’s supposed to be a wet day tomorrow but well above freezing, thanks Miser Brothers! My arm is not totally useless and the rest of me, including my knee and foot seem to be holding up. I got this...
PS: At 11:30pm got reception enough to call J again. He did some research and. pointed out that there is a side trail that I could take me out of here before Clingmans Dome. For now I’m sticking with the first plan but if it doesn’t start well tomorrow I’ll rethink.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584424,"For My Nephew Cam:
I was up before first light to prepare for a a lot of tough miles. The others were still snoring away as I organized my things and prepared breakfast on the bench outside the shelter. It was raining earlier and now a soupy fog hung in the air. 
That’s when I heard it. Something in the bushes rooting around in the dirt and making soft grunting noises. Shining my headlamp towards the sound I was startled to see two green eyes staring back at me through the darkness. There was a flash of gold as the eyes turned away... Leprechaun!!
He scampered away (NOBO) and I quickly packed up and headed up the mountain behind him. The chase was on! 
There was just enough light now for me to see the blazes marking the trail and I moved as quickly as I could. I rushed to get around each bend but he was never there. I knew he was headed for Clingmans Dome and if I could keep up I’d have him cornered there. 
Through the rain and wind I hiked on. The mud turned to snow, then to ice. Up past the leafless oaks and into the pines where the ground was covered with emerald moss. I must be catching up!
By mid afternoon the sun was out and I could see Clingmans Dome with it’s observation tower in the distance. He has to be just ahead of me, a few more miles and I’ll have him. 
Finally, after 9 hours, I arrived at the base of the mountain top observation tower. I was the only one around. Out of breath, I rushed up the long spiral ramp. He can’t get away now! 
At the top! Nothing. Just a cold wind and a view of the valleys below. He must have continued up into the clouds but this was as high as I could go. 
Defeated, I followed the trail down the other side of the mountain and towards the next shelter. It was nearly dark when I arrived, exhausted. I rewarded myself with a pot of rice and beans. Another magical day on the AT.","

Most of the people I’ve been hiking with over the past few days decided to stay the night at Double Spring Gap, short of the mountain top. They figured tomorrow’s weather offered a better chance of a clear day at the Clingmans famous viewing platform. There was no cell service at Double Spring and I still hadn’t spoken with J about a time for tomorrow’s pick up at Newfound Gap. I figured I’d get reception from the top or on the other side of the mountain. 
The long climb led through changing terrain and the first stands of pine trees I’ve seen so far. By the time I got to the top the sun came out and the view was fantastic! I enjoyed it alone; no other hikers around and the road up is closed for the winter. I hope tomorrow is just as clear for the others. 
The north face of Clingmans was a sheet of ice for the first 2 miles. For the first time I needed to use my “over the shoe” ice spikes and they worked as advertised. After 11 hours, nearly all uphill, I reached Mount Collins Shelter just before dark. 
There are only a few people here so I have to stay inside, at least there’s plenty of room to spread my exhausted self out. Still no cell service but J will be there. I just don’t know what time we’ll meet up.

Several popular hiking trails come together in this area and many students are out in the woods for Spring break. Last nights weather drove them all into the shelters. It was a tight fit and I didn’t sleep well at all. 
After hiking about 20 minutes I ran into J! Having not heard from me he drove into Cherokee, stayed in a hotel, and hiked in from Newfound Gap to meet me, reasoning that we couldn’t miss each other. Sound logic but as last nights shelter was on a side trail,  .5 miles off the AT, if I had left it 5 minutes later we might have missed each other. Luck? Trail Magic? Maybe. We figure that we’re just on the same wavelength.

X-rays and exam found no serious damage so I’m good to continue whenever I feel I’m ready. While looking at the X-rays with me the doctor pointed to a spot on my collarbone and asked, “How long ago did you break this?”. I have no idea. I guess if I broke my collarbone and didn’t know it then hiking with a NOT broken shoulder shouldn’t be a problem! 
Regardless it looks like I’m gonna get plenty of rest due to a major snow event in the Smokies. The same storm affecting folks back home is gonna dump 10-20 inches of snow on the trail. Most of the other hikers are waiting it out while stacked up like cordwood in the hostels and cheap hotels around Gatlinburg. I get to chill here at Casa del J...Nice!!!
Maria has been kind to let me use her car so I could get to the doctor, resupply, and make some minor gear purchases. I’ll spend tomorrow reorganizing my stuff and making a few repairs so I’m ready to go when the snow begins to melt, likely not until the weekend.","

Soon after I started out I came upon one of our Nation’s most beloved Natural Wonders: Charlies Bunion. A short side trail led to the iconic protuberance. Another hiker was snacking upon it and asked if I wanted him to move over so I could join him. I declined. I took a few chilly pictures from the foot of The Bunion and, as my shoes and feet were still frozen, I hiked on. 
Most of the snow is gone and the trail is drying out but there are still icy sections at higher elevations. I chose not to push on to the next shelter today because it’s higher up, best allow more thaw time for safe passage.

This afternoon I exited GSMNP. Good riddance, I did not like it there. The shelters were overcrowded because everyone was required to stay at them. Hence they were beat up, filled with graffiti and the areas around them were muddy, trampled down, and stripped bare for firewood. I just can’t imagine the mess when the real crush of hikers comes next month. It seems to me that with an ever increasing hiker population there would be less severe impact if they dispersed along the trail at smaller, more numerous campsites, perhaps with campfires prohibited. Just sayin...
A few hundred feet outside the park boundary “Smokey Mt. Angel” (a Class of 2019 hopeful) was set up with much appreciated Magic. She had soda, chips, fruit, candy, cheese, doughnuts, etc.. There also were 2 boxes of Mountain House hiker dinners donated by “Halfback” (Class of 2017). They’ll enable me, and some others, to get to the next town without resupply. Thanks Angels!!

This morning I chatted over breakfast  with SOBOer Slow Motion. He’ll soon complete his 2nd complete AT thruhike. He went NOBO 18 years ago. He shared info on trail conditions north of here and said he’s been passing about 30 NOBOers  every day. Holy cows, that’s like swimming upstream! All the little introductions and exchanges of “How’s  it goin?” and “Happy hiking!” must be exhausting. I hardly see anyone all day unless they (or I) are taking a break. Swim WITH the fishes, that’s the way to do it. 
On top of Snowbird Mountain there was an unmanned FAA air traffic radar facility silently watching the skies. I waved. 
At the end of the day on a grassy expanse on top of Max Patch someone proposed to his girl as I passed nearby, I clapped. They were with a small group of people (not hikers) and had a big tent set up for a celebration. It was a great idea, timed for sunset on the mountain top. But it was overcast and dark rain clouds were rapidly approaching across the valley. I hustled off the summit and ducked into the woods on the downwind side. As soon as I finished setting up a wicked wind kicked up and it began to pour rain. It will be a memorable engagement party - there’s no way that tent is still standing. Guys, this is important. Check the forecast, have a backup, do better. 
PS: After midnight the rain stopped and the moon came out so bright it almost kept me up. In the morning the sun lit up the tops of the trees briefly before clouds moved in again.

There was one bunk available but I opted to hang my hammock outside between a pair of flowering trees. There’s no rain in the forecast but I put up the tarp anyway to keep the falling pink petals off of me and my stuff. 
Three restaurants with local brews suggested a two night stay and hostel manager Jeffs announcement of Easter dinner for all sealed the deal. Twenty five dollars for the weekend covers two tree trunks, shower, laundry, use of the kitchen, and a meal. A less comfortable communal bunk inside would have been ten dollars more, worth it if it were raining.
The AT follows the sidewalk through the small Hot Springs business district. I saw lots of familiar faces milling about buying food and gear and looking for WiFi (it’s at the library). The local economy is dependent on passing hikers, bicycle riders, and motorcyclists. Hikers seem to be the largest group and are the ones most likely to spend the night. Those who can’t find or afford lodging set up just outside town - literally “down by the river” - and use the public bathrooms in the business district. I twice overheard locals talking about a proposal to close the bathrooms to discourage what, understandably, looks like a homeless camp. If they do that I think most of the hikers will still stay in the surrounding woods but the bikers would be less likely to stop on their way through. Oh the politics of public bathrooms, just like home. 
On Saturday night I excused myself from the hostel campfire to check out some live music at the tavern. As I left there were taunts of “Oh, you’re too good to hang out with filthy hikers”. At the tavern the music was outside on a deck overlooking the mighty French Broad River. I ended up inside, away from the music, at a big table with a bunch of filthy hikers.
On Sunday some continued NOBO while others arrived carrying Easter eggs that had been Magically hidden along the trail. I spent the day tweaking my gear, making phone calls, and chatting with several gentlemen thru hikers. One in particular, Cowboy, is a retired cowboy who is thru hiking despite some serious injuries from a tough career raising steak. I enjoyed learning about the beef industry from his hands on perspective. He is the second hiker from Nebraska I’ve met this week. The first, Kylo, indeed looks like the Star Wars guy. 
Easter dinner featured all the trimmings and the best ham I’ve ever had. An hour after dinner a Magic car pulled up and an anonymous couple unloaded boxes of hot food, cakes, and pie. There are no leftovers. The evening was topped off by an instrumental performance by Slide. She’s headed to Maine with an ultralight trombone strapped to her pack.

Walking uphill like that is hard on your feet, particularly your achilles because it’s stretched to the max with each step. I was careful to stop and stretch my calfs and hamstrings frequently to keep things as loose as possible. Nonetheless my left achilles is now a bit tender. I’ll have to monitor that very closely. But I digress...
After the long climb the trail followed a rocky ridge line with a broad valley to the west. The scenery was spectacular but the terrain was torturous. The white blazes had me scrambling over and between boulders; up into the sun for a view, then down into the rhododendron thickets, then back up again, over and over. It went on like that for miles so by the time I got down into more reasonable terrain I was exhausted. Passing the 300 mile marker gave me a brief lift as I dragged myself to the shelter.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586537,"I said goodbye to North Carolina today. Two states down, twelve to go! 
All my days out here are good but today was hands down the best so far. Sunny and cool with incredible views all day long. The trail went up and over vast grassy balds, occasionally ducking down into surreal groves of stunted moss covered trees, still bare of leaves. Pictures could not come close to capturing it.
I decided to stop in the town of Roan Mountain for laundry and a shower. There are two hostels at the road crossing. One is a longstanding business that offered a spot to hang my hammock for $10. The other recently opened and has varied accommodations starting at $30. Sounds simple right? Not so fast: the $30 place has a craft beer bar on premises! 
About half a mile out of town there was a man cutting brush on what looked to be an unmaintained side trail just off the AT. He introduced himself as a hostel owner and said he planned to re-establish the side trail leading directly to his hostel. 
“Do you like beer?”, he asked...“Yes. Yes, I do”...“My hostel has a craft beer bar and it’s right up the road from the trail, we’ve got plenty of beds tonight.” 
I thanked him, wished him well with his new business, and headed to Mountain Harbor Hostel for a $10 hammock spot. It’s very nice here, there’s a food truck with a hearty menu, lots of washing machines, and hot showers. After dinner a nice man from Germany gave me a Budweiser. It tasted crafty. Most of the folks I’ve seen on the trail this week are here too including Mel, Spirit Man, Moose, Cackles, Blade, and Fin. 
All is good in my little world tonite. 
Food truck breakfast is at 8:00 then resupply, relax for a few hours, and back NOBO. Tomorrow I’ll hit 400 miles...","Mile 380.6

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586679,"Another lovely sunny day, not as warm as predicted. Got started late after a magnificent food truck breakfast at the hostel: bravo Chef Dave! My belly was stuffed but the terrain was flatter and less rugged making for easy miles, some of them along a grassy river bank. Had I not showered only yesterday I might have jumped in. 
This week everyone got sunscreen out and we’re working on our hiker sock tan lines. At lower elevations the ground is green and the vines and trees are leafing out. The only shade so far has been under stands of balsam and inside the rhododendron tunnels. 
Fin met a SOBOer who reported passing 68 NOBOers in one day. I recall Slow Motion passed about 30 a few weeks ago. That means the big bubble is getting closer. I hadn’t noticed because I haven’t stayed near the shelters much recently. Most nights I’ve been “stealth” camping. That means just finding a spot anywhere along the trail, usually away from established campsites. 
When hikers meet in the afternoon it’s often asked “where are you headed to?”. My answer has been “6 or 7:00”. I find it more efficient to hike till evening, load up on water, and continue until I find a nice spot. The hammock makes it easy because I don’t need level ground to set up. If I had a tent I think I’d need to hire a caddy to help me read the greens searching for a flat spot!

First thing in the morning I called back, arraignments were made, and John picked me up at 4:00 after a mostly downhill hike to the next road crossing. After I got cleaned up John treated me to burger, beer, and conversation (Kathy is out of town, due back late tonite). Now, here I am in a real bed for the first time in weeks.

I enjoyed their company, the excellent food, and the super comfy bed! I am grateful once again for the opportunity to spend time with good friends as part of my journey.
Last night John and I went to Appalachian State University (where they both work) to hear a presentation about abolitionist John Brown’s many children. It was interesting and relevant to learn more about the man as the AT will take me right through Harpers Ferry Historical Park in about a month.
This morning I hired one of Dr. Schroeder’s students to give me a ride back to the trail. Joshua dropped me off right where John picked me up and I was back in the rhododendrons. I followed a river for a bit. There was a big waterfall followed by some tricky waterside steps along a rock face. Saturday’s rain has swollen the river and it was overflowing onto the trail in spots. As I climbed uphill it got very windy and up high there was still snow on the ground. Someone made a snowman along the trail leading back down to Watauga Lake. 
They’ve had bear problems at Watauga the past few years so the shelter and camping areas are closed. Signs are posted banning anyone from entering the area except “Park Rangers, Firefighters, and AT Thru Hikers”. I’ve got two of those covered! The rules required me to hike through the area without stopping. I covered the five miles quickly, went a little further to be safe, and here I am on a ridgeline watching the sun set.

There’s a nice kitchen in the common area so I bought groceries and cooked myself dinner to celebrate my 2 month hiking anniversary. It was quite nice and healthy to boot.
After dinner I went to Damascus Brewing Co. to sample the suds. The place was full of filthy hikers, my kinda place! Had a long talk with Crazy Brit and bought a beer for the German guy, Marco, who gave me a Budweiser last week. He’s off trail tomorrow heading to NYC and a decidedly not swanky $40 lower east side hostel before returning home. I advised him to skip Tompkins Square Park and head west to Washington Square. He plans to return to the US and continue his AT adventure from here next year.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587562,"Another beautiful day. I left Damascus about noon after meeting long lost John for coffee, he’s finally caught up after his foot injury and is taking a zero there. It was good to see another Jersey hiker...so few of us out here.
There are no doubt statistics on all of this this but here is roughly what I see:
40%-50% of thru hikers are from southeastern states, 20%-30% are from the rest of the US, and the rest are from abroad: mostly Germany, England, and Australia. Sidebar: If you mistake an Australian accent for British they politely correct you. If you mistake British for Australian you get “the look”. I don’t guess anymore.
With few exceptions Americans and Canadians are either in their 20s or their 50s. Europeans are usually in their 30s-40s. 
20s are hiking fast to get back to school or job. Foreigners have visas that run out in 6 months. We greybeards generally aren’t in a hurry. A surprising number are retired from military service, teaching, or other government work. I’ve met more than a few retired firefighters/EMTs but no law enforcement folks.
Perhaps 4 of 10 hikers are women. Nearly every thru hiker I’ve met is white. The ATC recently established a program to expand the diversity the the hiking community. Interestingly the folks I see out hiking for a day or weekend are more racially diverse. 
In Damascus and along the trail today there was another group of travelers: bicycle people, lots of them. The famous Virginia Creeper Bike Trail parallels the AT for several miles here, with a river separating the two. It was full of cyclists of all ages, from families with young children to full blown, tights wearing, pro looking bike guys. From what I saw in town cyclists gravitate to the more swanky establishments. Hikers generally shop at Dollar General and sleep in bunks.
I stayed in an upscale lodge last night and talked touring bikes with one of the peddlists from an upstairs room. I asked him a few questions about expensive bike. He was happy to extol its many virtues and told me of the adventures they’d had together. He was decidedly not interested in my hiking gear or anything about my adventure. Hmmm...

I’m camped at over 5000ft close to the top of Mt Rogers, Virginia’s highest peak. So...that means it’s all downhill into Harpers Ferry?
The trees are still leafless but the rocky hillsides are covered with small white flowers with light pink stripes. There’s enough of them so that it looks like snow on the ground. Pretty cool. 
And wouldn’t ya know it, just after I said there are few Jersey guys out here I met Shawn wearing a Sevens Tech Lacrosse shirt. He’s originally from Ocean City and knows Bay Head as he used to take the train frequently. He was on a day hike with his dog and headed for the summit but wisely turned back before reaching it so he could get down to his car before dark.

Mt Rogers and the Grayson Highlands were mostly void of trees and the wind was wicked, driving the rain (and me, on occasion) sideways. My gear was sufficient to keep me warm and mostly dry as long as I kept moving. 
All I saw of the famous ponies that reside here was manure, apparently they don’t work in the rain. I saw other hikers but none of them were thru hiking making me wonder if I was following the right trail. At one point the enveloping clouds lifted to reveal a spectacular view. I took pictures from a few different spots before realizing I was no longer on the AT. I got out my phone and used the GPS app to get back on track...30 minutes and unnecessary energy wasted. Got some good pictures though!

There were cows mooing in the woods. Kinda odd. Every now and then I caught a glimpse of them through the trees. Are they following me? Dynasty (NOBO) heard tell of a local bull that will stand on the trail and stare you down: “You shall not pass!”. Out of respect I kept the jerky tucked away and had SPAM for lunch. 
As I ate the SPAM at one of the shelters a young lady was distressed as she had lost touch with her hiking partner. She didn’t know if he was ahead or behind and cell phones hadn’t worked all day. She was about to leave a note and hike on when he walked up. She gave him a big hug and the song “Reunited” began playing in my mind. And THEN the guy actually starts singing it! Peace’s and Herb?! How many people actually know that song?! Now it’s stuck in my head along with the “500 miles” song.

Because it’s been so nasty out I’ve been eating more food than usual to keep my energy up. Resupply is after tomorrow so in an effort to conserve I had a very light breakfast. Soon my energy level was low and I was struggling. Wouldn’t ya know it: as I came to a road crossing Ramblin’ Rose got out of her van and held out a bowl of goodies!! She was waiting for her NOBO husband Turtle...I’m glad he’s not named Hare or she might have been gone already. I gratefully gobbled down snack cakes and Easter candy then took some “to go” as Napoleon (NOBO) walked up and took my place at the Magic trough. Thanks Ramblin’ Rose!
That food helped but I still needed to conserve. I stopped at a shelter to cook a meager portion of rice for lunch. As I ate four Day Hikers showed up and gave me Fritos and an orange. They had packed in dry wood and got a cozy fire going in the shelter fireplace while we chatted. Shawn (NOBO) arrived and as I’d eaten all the Magic Fritos they gave him half a sub. Things do have a way of working out. Thanks Day Hikers!
This afternoon I saw my first deer, or at least the first one not running away. It waited patiently for me to take some pictures before bounding off into the fog. Later as I crossed a cow pasture the tale proved to be true: A bull was grazing right smack dab on the trail and eyeballed me as I detoured around him. Gandalf!
George Nicholas is driving down from New Jersey tomorrow with my lighter “summer” gear.

It was good to see him again and share experiences since we last spoke. He’s hiking on from here tomorrow but we’re both certain we’ll meet again as we leapfrog each other NOBO.
George arrived right on time and made a positive impression by plopping down a bag of goodies to share amongst those present. Then we walked back to his van and took Rt. 81 to Damascus where we checked in to the Virginia Creeper Lodge and went out for dinner and beers. 
On Friday we prepared a classic Jersey breakfast with fresh Kaiser rolls, Pork Roll, eggs, and cheese from George’s bountiful cooler. Then we walked through town picking up supplies and food for the next leg of my journey. 
I spent the rest of the day switching out my winter gear for the summer stuff George had brought from home. My pack should be smaller and lighter now because the summer gear is smaller and I now need fewer clothes. After loading it up and adding 5 days of food it was a bit smaller but didn’t seem any lighter...oh well, I gotta carry what I need so no sense complaining. He also brought along my second pair of shoes. The ones I started with, as expected, are fully deprecated after 500 miles and were, without ceremony, retired to the trash bin.

This afternoon as I descended into Shenandoah Valley the trees and shrubs were beginning to bloom and the sweet smell made me slow down. I briefly considered camping there but there’s a “hiker friendly” restaurant in Atkins and I planned to have early dinner there to extend my food bag. 
As I approached “The Barn” restaurant only one vehicle was in the parking lot (a tractor trailer truck). A sign said, “leave backpacks outside” so I put mine where I could watch it through the window. When I entered there was one customer, presumably the trucker. 
The waitress told me to sit where I wanted and before I could the trucker said, “I’ll pay the hikers tab”. Well that’s super nice but now what do I do? I can’t say no (that’d be rude) and I can’t accept and then sit across the room while we both eat alone. Forcing down my social anxiety I asked him if I could join him. “Of course! I’d love to talk.” Here we go...
He was indeed the operator of the big rig outside (based near Rochester, NY) but surprise, surprise: he also goes by the trail name “Little Drummer Boy” and hiked the entire AT in 2011! Very cool!
The burger was delicious and we talked trail and trucks for over an hour. He payed the tab and I showed him my pack as we left (packs have changed since 2011). As we parted ways he directed me how to get back on the trail without doubling back by pointing out the white blaze painted on the I-81 overpass a few hundred feet away.

Even though the summer gear is less bulky there’s barely room for everything when I have a full load of food - it’s usually 2 or 3 days before I’ve eaten enough to be truly comfortable carrying it. I’m seriously considering ordering a slightly larger version of the same pack. 
I started walking knowing that my friend Dave had parked at Possum Creek and was hiking SOBO toward me. He is in the area this week and made plans to join me for a few miles on the trail then go to dinner, stay at a hotel, and drop me back on the trail in the morning. What could go wrong?
It’s the ATC and it’s local affiliate hiking clubs that acquire and maintain the route this trail follows. While much of the “trail corridor” is on public lands it frequently traverses private property and occasionally needs to be rerouted. Dave, an experienced backpacker with a just purchased map of the area, got caught in a rerouting in progress. 
After passing thru hikers for much of the morning suddenly he saw no one except an apparently lost Bobo (NOBO). They had both missed new blazes at points where the trail had very recently been rerouted and were on the abandoned portion. Bobo went on NOBO. Dave continued SOBO and luckily rejoined the trail before we missed each other and we met near an unremarkable spot called Tilson Gap. Yes, the cartographers left out an “L”.

It was proof positive that no matter how long it is between meetings old friendships never need to be renewed. I’m certain we’ll be seeing more of each other soon. Thanks Dave!
A few hours into the arduous climb out of the valley I heard a voice behind me. “Is that Chip?”. It was John catching up to me again. He had another injury but is back and walking strong.

For most of the day the trail followed the rim of a 10 mile wide sinkhole called Burke’s Garden. It was formed eons ago when the limestone underneath the area collapsed. Looking down into it reminded me of Meteor Crater in Arizona except here the view is through trees and the bottom is covered by farmland instead of bare rocks. 
Because the trail followed the high rim and, I suspect, because the local limestone is porous, the distance between water sources was much longer than I’m used to. Up till now it’s been rare to go more than a few miles without coming to a stream or spring. Here there are 10 mile dry stretches. This afternoon I came to a dirt road where the guides indicated there was water. Pancakes (Portland, OR) and Mule (Cleveland!) were there and advised me there was none. The next source was several miles north and we were all out. As we stood there feeling sorry for ourselves a minivan drove by and Mule shouted “Do you have any water?”. The minivan stopped, backed up, and Dale and his wife pulled 2 cases of water out of the back. We chatted with them while chugging bottle after bottle, big grins on our faces. What a sight. We drank our fill, topped off our storage bottles, and left the extras trail side for the next thirsty hikers. Magic!
More dry hiking tomorrow but the terrain should be good, gonna push for 15 miles to see how my knee handles it. 

Q&A: 
Q: From Manasquan Elementary - What made you want to hike the Appalachian Trail?
A: I can’t point to a specific thing that made me want to do this, I’ve just always known I would do it someday. I knew about the AT because my family used to go camping every summer and the trail passed near some of the campgrounds. I was also in Scouts and they would mention it all the time. 
I do, however, know the specific moment I discovered I loved being out in the woods: I was very young, maybe 4 or 5, and I overheard my parents talking in the kitchen: “Charles, you’ve got to do something with your son”...”OK, but what?”...”Just something.” Soon after that Dad drove me out into the pines, parked the car, and we walked straight into the woods. Little was said, the only sound was our crunching steps. After what seemed like forever we stopped and sat down. He got out some Sterno and cooked SPAM. We ate, walked back to the car, and drove home. Simple as that. I’ve loved being outside ever since. I also love SPAM - got some in my pack right now!","Mile 570.7

The shelter is 0.3 miles off trail and it’s  another 0.3 miles from the shelter to the water in the ravine below. That’s a round trip of 1.2 miles without making any NOBO progress! There’s almost nothing us hikers dread more than a long walk off trail for shelter or water.
The highlight of the day was lunch at Brushy Mountain Outpost. Located right on the trail they serve breakfast and lunch, sell hiker groceries and supplies, and have a phone charging station. I had a Country Burger (instead of beef it’s a big slab of fried baloney), a basket of cajon fries, Mountain Dew, V-8, a honey bun, 2 pickled eggs, and a peach milkshake. Hooyah! While digesting I stocked up on supplies and charged my phone. 
It varies week to week but here’s what’s in my food bag now (it’s enough for about 5 days):

Instant rice to be cooked with Goya flavor packets, milled flax seed, olive oil, and meat or cheese.

Had me a big ham samich, a chili dog, a butterfinger bar, 2 Gatorades, a V-8, and a bottle of strawberry milk. There was an elderly gentlemen there who asked each of us where where we were from: Texas, Alabama, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, etc..  when asked where he was from he proudly declared, “Why I’m from right here!” I bought a few food items for the trail including a can of sweetened condensed milk (1300 calories!). I’m gonna either mix it with vanilla breakfast drink powder and water for a shake or cook it with rice and add the drink powder for rice pudding. Chairman Kaga says, “Allez Cuisine!”
I made a rookie mistake setting up for tonight: Rain was imminent so I took the time to tie my tarp super taught using extra stakes and lines then adjusted everything to perfection - Good. I hung the hammock “just right” underneath it and rigged the bug net and insulation - Great. Next I got everything organized for tomorrow and hung my pack from a tree - Excellent. Then, just as rain began, I put on my sleeping clothes and proudly laid down in my nest - D’oh!! One of the trees I tied to is a smallish Maple and it’s bending under the weight so everything sags badly. I’ll stay dry, I think, but I can hear Slider, wherever she is, playing her Sad Trombone for me... wah~wah~wah~~","Mile 606.7

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589237,"It rained in and off last night but I stayed dry. A bit of rain during the day wasn’t enough to get out the rain gear. According to trailside message spelled out in sticks (no doubt by a Euro-hiker), I passed the 1000 kilometer mark. I have great respect for, and appreciate the advantages of the metric system but here in The States we take bigger bites. I’m hiking miles! 
A few hours in I came to a dirt road and the entire area ahead was blackened by fire (it smelled like BHFC’s truck bay after a worker). There was a handwritten note, dated yesterday, tied to a tree saying the fire should be out “in a few days” and that hikers should follow the road to the next trail crossing. Hmmm...not very official. How far is it? How do I find the trail again? I have two trail guides and neither will help me follow a road. 
Last nights rain had wet everything down and I only saw smoke coming from a few stumps so after thinking about it a few minutes I decided to cautiously hike through. It obviously had been a “controlled burn”. Firefighters had lit fire along each side of the trail and left it to slowly run up and downhill. Not once in almost 2 miles was trail surface scorched or charred creating a surreal, shoulder width green path across the black forest floor. A successful burn, nice job guys! 
Mid afternoon I stopped at a shelter to eat and rest. Thunderstorms were imminent and there was occasional rumbling in the distance. I decided to press on a few more hours so I could get into Pearisburg tomorrow morning. About 4:30 the sky darkened and I picked a spot to set up, this time choosing bigger trees. Once again I meticulously buttoned everything down just in time. The gusty thunderstorm lasted about an hour and everything held up, more are due overnight.

Angels Rest Hostel is what hikers call a “Vortex” - a place so nice you get sucked in and can’t leave. I left many of my comrades behind there. Some are still recovering from a Cinco Dr Mayo party two nights ago. Eventually the vortex will spit them all back out onto the trail. 
Thunderstorms threatened all day with dark clouds and rumbling staying just west of the trail. The threat of lightning this afternoon prompted me to stop and set up shelter. The storms fizzled out before reaching me but I enjoyed the two hour nap. 
I’m going to try to get to Daleville, 84 miles from here, without spending any nights off the trail. Resupply is scarce on this stretch so I’ve got to step it up, no more naps! If I can put in several days of steady mileage I should be able to predict when I’ll enter Shenandoah NP.
Note: I haven’t forgotten your questions. I’ll get to them as my battery allows me the “screen time” (I also need battery for the GPS trail guide). I won’t be able to recharge for several days so posts will be brief and I might skip a day or two.","Angels Reat Hostel

Later I went through an area that had been decimated by gypsy moths a few years ago. The dead trees are rotted and falling prompting the ATC to close one of the shelter areas. 
I also passed by a spot occupied by some “tree sitters” protesting a gas pipeline project. Yesterday I passed through a construction area where a US Forest Service officer was screening hikers, presumably to prevent protesters from disrupting activities. Hint to protesters attempting to enter: don’t bathe for a week, strap 35 pounds to your back, and walk up like you’re expecting some food. He’ll let you pass but he will not give you candy bars.

Around noon I passed the Audie Murphy Memorial. Audie was our most decorated World War II Veteran. He died in a plane crash nearby. There were many flags and personal items of tribute placed there.
All the trees have leaves now. They’re still light green, not the dark green they’ll be come summer, making for light filtered shade. Very pleasant. 
Dogwood petals are falling and new flowers are appearing including Lady Slippers, Lilly of the Valley, Azalia, and (promising future snacks) Blueberry and Blackberry. When the wind is calm you can hear the forrest buzzing with insects flying among the flowers. Fortunately these bugs aren’t interested in me, they’ll come later. 
New wildlife today: small brown lizards darting through the leaves and hummingbirds. I haven’t gotten a good look at the tiny birds but they seem attracted to the yellow jacket hanging from my pack . Now and then I hear one hovering over my shoulder, just out of sight.
Late afternoon I crossed a small footbridge and was disappointed to see a pile of cans and bottles...oh, wait a minute...they’re full...Coke and bottled water left in the cool stream just for me, and two German women who came up as I was leaving with two Cokes in my pack.

There’s always more people on weekends but today the weather was awesome and I hiked by two popular, or shall I say iconic, protuberances: Dragon’s Tooth and McAfee Knob. As you might expect, a short side trail led to each one. 
I stopped at Dragon’s Tooth early this morning. Its formed by giant toothlike slabs of rock sticking straight up along the ridge line. The view from the tooth top was surely spectacular but climbing the 30ft up seemed too treacherous, best not to risk banging myself up for a photo. 
I had lunch and topped off my food bag at a gas station/deli/grocery about a half mile off trail. Lots of locals passed through while I ate at the picnic table outside but I was the only hiker. I’m glad I stopped because I needed the calories for the long climb to McAfee Knob. 
Mcafee Knob is the most photographed spot along the entire AT. It’s obvious why when you see it: the same type of rocks that form Dragon’s Tooth are laying flat there and jut out from the ridge line forming a ledge where you can dangle your feet above the valley far below. It really is quite spectacular. A few hikers and I took turns taking each other’s pictures. 
I’ve got reservations for Sunday & Monday nights in Daleville - 15.4 trail miles from here. I’ve pushed about as hard as my body allowed this week and need a recovery day. I’m going to tweak  my food selections on the next section in an effort to squeeze a few more miles out of each day. I tend to get weak towards evening and need more afternoon calories. I put a lot of thought into figuring out what foods will work out here and also ask other hikers what they eat. Most recent change: I switched from Gatorade powder to Jello.

Sunday’s weather was hot. I heard some hikers say it had affected their mileage but I had no problem, maybe I’m not moving fast enough to get overheated. 
The Rhododendrons were blooming and the Mountain Laurels are getting ready. Late in the day I passed through a long tunnel of Honeysuckle bushes, sweet!
Saw my first rattlesnake. The rattle end was two feet into the trail, the rest hidden in leaves. Hmmm...what to do. I spotted it easily but it wasn’t hard to imagine someone else coming along and stepping on it. I tossed a few sticks to move it along but that only prompted it to lift its head and look at me, flicking its tongue...unnerving. A closer look revealed it had just eaten (Oh no! Mr. Chipmunk!) and was not inclined to yield so I passed leaving plenty of space between us, his head followed my movements. 
I trudged into Daleville Sunday evening with a dead phone and a very low personal energy level. Luckily the Howard Johnson’s Hotel where I stayed was only a few hundred feet from the trail with a great BBQ a short walk up the highway.

There were also some spots where all the trees had been cut down and left on the ground, presumably to provide better views from the road.

-Injury? I’ve already dealt with that. If I get hurt badly there are always other hikers around to help.
-Lost? The Trail is easy to follow, It’d be nearly impossible to really get lost. 
So the short answer is no. I don’t get scared. I will say that before I started this adventure the enormity of it frightened me, especially how long it’ll take. Until now I’ve never been away from home for longer than a couple weeks. Will I get homesick? Will people at home miss me. Or worse will they not miss me. I still worry about those things...and here I am.

I was dry but I could hear the water running over the ground beneath me. When I poked my head out in the morning the people in the campsites nearby were all gone, got swamped in their tents I suppose. The trail went from running water to muddy quagmire all day but I still made good miles. 
Ran into my first bear. I was walking along and didn’t see him till I was about 20ft away. He was right next to the trail foraging in the low brush. I stopped and asked him to move. He just looked at me. I banged my hiking poles together and asked again but he just kept poking around eating stuff. I couldn’t continue on the trail without getting closer to him so I took a few steps back and stood there talking to him. Just as was about to take a picture 2 hikers came along from the other direction. Now there were 3 people talking at him so, just to get us to shut up, he decided to let us through. He slowly grazed his way away from the trail and we passed without incident. I kept moving till he was out of sight then realized I never took a picture. Just then I saw another bear running away from me on the trail ahead, missed that picture too. Oh well.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592643,"Most of the day was clear and bright. The air felt a little dryer but the ground is still soaked from the torrential rains. I’m not in touch with the news but somebody must be getting slammed down river, so much water. The main road in and out of this area (Rt. 33?) is closed due to landslides. 
I felt good this morning and got an early start. The bruised leg was hardly noticeable, knee was good, energy level high. I hit the trail with a vigor I hadn’t felt in a few weeks. About an hour in there was a big boulder on my right with water trickling down the side...
“Hey, that looks just like the boulder I saw yesterd...oh no...I’m going the wrong way!!!” 
GPS confirmed that I was indeed headed back to Georgia. Dejected, I turned around and trudged two, now familiar,  miles back to where I began. When I got there I treated myself to a snack and a packet of jello mixed with water. The sugar didn’t improve my mood but it did keep the energy up. 
I soon arrived at a stream where I loaded up on water and washed my now sweaty shirt. As I was leaving a former thru hiker turned ATC Ridge Runner Ridge Runner walked up. I told him what happened and we laughed. He asked me when I had started my hike and I embarrassingly told him February 20. He said: “Tortise wins every time, you’re doing fine”. He was telling me what I already know but having him reinforce it meant a lot. We talked a while and as I was preparing to leave another thru hiker came up. I told her may tale of woe and she said I was the second person she saw today who had made the same mistake. Now I felt better. I bid them both farewell and continued NOBO with a spring in my step as she and Ridge Runner conversed. No doubt he had some magic words for her too. 
I saw another bear. It ran away as I surprised it coming around a bend. Again, no picture. I also saw a few deer. Curiously they didn’t run away, one actually followed me for a few hundred feet. What’s with that?
I’m in another “official” campground tonight. Again, I arrived, registered, and set up just before heavy rains began. A recurring theme, it seems. There’s a camp store so I’ll be stocked up for the next few days. On we go...","Hightop Hut

I really, really look forward to putting on wet socks every morning. Maybe I’ll keep a wet pair bedside at home when I’m done with this just to reminisce. Good times. 
I stopped for lunch and supplies at Big Meadows wayside. The restaurant menu lists the caloric value of each item so I scanned for the highest numbers and ordered over 2000 calories. Hey, it was mostly uphill all afternoon!
The mud has slowed everyone down so I’ve been seeing the same people each night for the last several days. One of the things that picks me up is hearing people talking through the trees as I approach a shelter after a long day. It’s also nice to see a familiar face or two upon arrival. I suppose we all feel the same way.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592924,"Hard, steady rain continued through the night and into this morning. It would’ve been impossible to get packed up without getting my sleeping gear wet so I slept in. I peered out from under the tarp and saw that the others were doing the same. 
By 9:00 the rain had lessened enough for me to venture out and retrieve my food from the provided  “bear pole” where it had hung overnight. To my dismay critters had somehow climbed up the 12ft steel pole, chewed a hole in the bag, and helped themselves to some oatmeal. They didn’t take much but water had spread sticky Maple & Brown Sugar flavor throughout the bag. I dumped everything out onto the picnic table outside the shelter and wiped it down as best I could as the downpour resumed and made a sticky mess of it all. 
Yuck. 
By 11:00 I was ready and hiked off into the rain leaving behind several hikers who had decided to spend the day at the shelter. After a few hours in the tempest I began to wish I’d done the same. Rivers of water ran off the hillsides turning sections of hiking trail into a route more suited for kayaking. The dirt and gravel had washed away in many spots leaving a jumble of sharp rocks and slippery roots. 
By 4:00 the rain began to lighten up and I sloshed into a picnic area with covered tables to prepare a hot meal. Soaked and chilly but reenergized I continued 2 more miles to where I am now. The rain stopped long enough for me to set up and hang my food...again on the bear pole. 
If, as I suspect, Noah is building somewhere nearby I have to accept the possibility that critters might be foraging, two by two, in order to provision his ark. There’s more oatmeal in the bag if you need it. But could you take the Apples and Cinnamon flavor this time? The Maple is my favorite.","Rock Spring Hut

I had to spend much of the day drying out my stuff; everything I have was damp or soaked and leaving it packed would invite mildew. A parade of hikers passed by my clotheslines: lots of day-hikers, some of the crew who took a zero at the shelter yesterday, and some NOBEers I hadn’t seen in a month; Skywater among them. It was early afternoon by the time I donned dry socks and hit the trail for the short hike to this shelter area. 
I saw a huge bear shortly before I got here, too big to stop for a picture. Another hiker saw it too. A Ridge Runner stopped by to remind everyone to use the bear box despite the presence of two bear poles. I put my entire pack in there.
Back in Smoky Mountain National Park hikers were required to stay at the shelter areas and I didn’t like it. Here in Shenandoah you’re allowed to camp anywhere (within certain guidelines) but because there are so many bears around I feel better staying where I can easily store my stuff out of their reach. When I get out of “bear country” I hope to get back into the routine of camping between shelters. That flexibility will allow me to put in a few more miles each day.

The weather was clear and warm when Uncle Phil & Aunt Ellen dropped me off at Rt 522 after a nice breakfast. It was a great zero, thanks!!!
This is the day I disappeared from the journal. My water resistant iPhone X was no match for the recent wet weather. I had gone to a Verizon store and successfully claimed a new one through insurance but it wouldn't be delivered (to Bay Head) for a few days. I declined the non-Apple ""loaner"" phone they offered because I felt it could complicate the photo and data transfer and mine seemed to be drying out slowly. I reckoned it would get me through till I got the new one. WRONG! That evening after a few bright green flashes the screen went black. Fortunately it came back on occasionally over the next several days allowing me to get in a few calls and make plans for the coming week. I decided not to update this journal for a while to preserve the phone and took notes each day on paper...how primitive.

Another nice day with thunderstorms in the evening. 
I saw Napoleon briefly as he hiked past my campsite in the morning. I thanked him for some food tips he gave me last month. A dozen or so Boy Scouts were hiking this part of the trail with their leaders, I saw them every day for a while. There were also a few groups of Japanese tourists out for the day.
While eating lunch a big filling fell out of my tooth. Great. That'll require a dentist.

Rod Hollow Shelter to Bears Den Hostel
9.9 miles
On this dreary day I planned to go 13 miles. Because my phone GPS trail guide was unavailable I didn't note when exactly I passed mile 1000 but the weather had me in a non celebratory mood anyhow ...da,da,da,da... if I must. By mid afternoon it was pouring so hard I decided to stop early at Bears Den Hostel, just a stones throw from the trail. 
Bears Den is a visitor center and hostel operated by the Patomac Appalachian Trail club. It's an old, classy looking stone building with immaculately manicured grounds. As I approached I imagined those inside chatting politely while sipping tea and eating tiny sandwiches. Perhaps I was right because a sign on the door said:
""Closed for private event, thru hikers use back entrance.""
Behind the building there was a door to the basement, probably a former servants entrance. Another sign: ""Thru hikers only. No day visitors or scouts beyond this point."" The door had a push button lock with a note explaining how to get the entry code from my hikers guide by subtracting the mileage of one specific landmark from another. Very secure, what could they be hiding in there? No matter, it wasn't locked. 
Inside was a small ""mud room"" piled high with wet shoes, socks, and packs. The odor was impressive. The interior door was equipped with a floor seal to contain the smell, kinda like a space station air lock. I removed my wet things and opened the door to see filthy hikers sprawled out on well worn couches, chairs, and bunks. Among them: Honeybun, Crush, Buck, No Filter, and aptly named Trenchfoot (eewwww!). Wet gear hung from the bunk ends. As at most hostels a wall was posted with prices for the accommodations, common sense rules of conduct, useless WiFi login info, off color hiker art and humor, and a big ""2018"" poster board to sign and memorialize ones stay. A locked interior door leading upstairs bore another sign: ""This door will open at 5pm and close at 9am."" 
I hit the spartan but clean shower then joined the others watching a movie while we awaited release from our dungeon. At exactly 5pm the door opened and we all stomped up the stairs. 
The upstairs didn't smell and was equipped with a big kitchen, comfortable furniture, large dining tables, and two bunk rooms for those not belonging to the exclusive downstairs club. On the walls were paintings of spectacular views, inspirational hiking quotes, and photos of squeaky clean, hyper attractive people enjoying the outdoors (usually taken through a frosted lens with some dandelion fluff floating by). Pamphlets, books, and periodicals were available to help plan ones dreamy hike. 
Our amiable host and dungeon master, Glen, called everyone into the small gift shop to collect our fare. The $30 ""hiker special"" included a bunk, shower & towel, laundry, use of the kitchen, a frozen pizza, one soda, a pint of iced cream, and a self cook/clean pancake breakfast. It was a good night. The others reported that I did not snore.

Bears Den Hostel to David Lesser Shelter
11.2 miles
After we all pitched in making pancakes and cleaning up I hiked out into the dreary weather while the others stayed back watching Shawn of the Dead. The weather soon improved nicely and by days end they all had passed me again. 
I think this was the day I hiked through the famous ""Roller Coaster"". It's an infamous stretch of trail named for its relentless ""PUDs"" (Pointless Ups and Downs). I found it quite refreshing to only hike uphill for 10 minutes or so before going downhill again. Back in Georgia and NC it seemed I walked uphill for days! There was also a long level section with sharp rocks sticking up ominously called ""The Devils Racetrack"". So it's level and all I have to do is step around things? HA-HA-HA!

David Lesser Shelter to Harpers Ferry, WV
9.3 miles
This day I FINALLY left Virginia and hiked into Harpers Ferry, the symbolic halfway point on the AT (the literal halfway spot is a bit further north). I had long planned to travel home for my parents 60th anniversary party on Saturday the 16th and from Harpers Ferry I could get there by train. There are many people (including friends Melissa and Steve in Harpers Ferry) who have offered to help me during my travels but not having a reliable phone made it difficult to coordinate so I decided to travel without the help. I'm remain thankful that it's available though!
When I got into town I went to the ATC headquarters to have my picture taken for inclusion in their 2018 hiker book and bought some copies as my phone no longer took pictures. After a nice dinner I stayed the night at a hotel where I booked Amtrak tickets back to Jersey on Wednesday.

Harpers Ferry, WV to Bay Head, NJ and back.
0.0 trail miles
I left the hotel at 5am to catch the local train to DC. From there Amtrak got me to Newark then NJ Transit to Bay Head and a short walk home. After being gone so long I thought it might be weird going home but it wasn't. I think traveling ""the long way"" by train helped.
I had a great week with Joyce, family, friends, firefighters, and with my parents to celebrate their big 60th anniversary. I got a new phone, a new bigger backpack, some fresh bug proofed clothes, drank some beers, and rested my knee. I also got to my dentist and as I feared Mr. Tooth requires major work so I will head home again in a few weeks for that. Ahhh...root canal and summer at the Jersey Shore. What could be better!
Today I reversed my train route from last week and am now back in Harpers Ferry ready to walk. Wasn't that exciting!

The trail leaves town on a railroad bridge. On the other side was Maryland. The first few miles followed the the old C&O Canal towpath which has been made into a bike path....very flat and smooth. 
 
The well worn trail soon turned away from the canal and up into the mountains. It rained briefly as if to welcome me back. My legs were a bit stiff as I neglected to do my daily stretches during the break...take a note on that. My knees are also bothering me, the rest seems to have made them worse. 
I'm using my new, slightly bigger pack now. It'll take a while to get the fit and load balance dialed in. One of the frame pieces broke already, that's disappointing but I can still use it until they send a new part.

I passed the first Washington Monument (built 50 years before the one in DC) and skirted an area called Annapolis Rocks.
I was determined to cover at least 15 miles and the trail was rugged and slick for much of the way so extra attention to footing was in order. So much attention that I missed an obvious turn and ended up walking 30 minutes down a side trail before noticing. Arrggg!!!

One of them, Rambling Wraith, clued me in on an excellent burger joint called Timbers, just off the trail on US Rt 30. I gorged on a huge burger, bacon cheese fries, several Mountain Dews, and a Strawberry shake. They love filthy hikers, 5 Stars!! 
Here at the shelter this evening the conversation was getting deep, turning to religion and politics (in a non-confrontational way). I avoided chiming in until section hiker Mary, a fellow hammocker, saved me by asking some questions about my set up. We chatted hammocks and hiking for a spell, it was nice. 
Monk, a friend of friend Bob Hein, is also hiking NOBO and catching up to me quickly. I checked out his Facebook page and he's absolutely flying up the trail. I expect he'll overtake me in the next couple of days so I sent him a message describing myself. Maybe he'll slow down long enough for a picture.
I'm trying to make 15 miles a day the new ""normal"" but my knee doesn't like and is hurting pretty bad tonight. If I'm unable to bump up the daily distance I might not get to Maine before cold weather closes Mt. Kahtahdin (the finish line).

Across the hall is a bathroom with a somewhat newer (1950s?) shower that puts out out Niagra volumes of piping hot water.

I was trying to get to a shelter where there might be some holiday Magic but about 5:00 some very close lightning strikes prompted me to get off the ridge line a few miles short. It rained some but has stopped now and I can hear multiple fireworks shows in the distance. 
In my haste to get out of the rain I sat incorrectly in my hammock and slid out the back side onto the ground ripping the attached bug net from its zipper. This is not good. I got it sorta tied back on but  it's not something I'll be able to fix well enough to rely on. Hopefully the company that made it is open tomorrow and can send me a new one ASAP.

I hiked for a bit with Max (NOBO). He's having a run of bad luck. He got caught in an overnight flash flood last week and lost most of his gear as water swept everything, including him, downstream. Yikes! He's got replacement stuff now but had the misfortune to have his wallet and phone stolen at a crowded shelter last night. There were a lot of people there who hiked in just for one night to celebrate the 4th. I had intended to camp there last night, glad I didn't

The climb out of Lehigh Valley was brutal. I had to climb nearly straight up boulders and loose rocks while the weight of my pack threatened to pull me off balance and backward off the cliffs...very scary! 
The trail ran through rocky and treeless hills for miles. At one point I went under huge buzzing power lines. I've crossed countless utility corridors so far but this was different; the steel towers were not silver/grey like all the others but dark and ominous looking. I know it sounds weird but they somehow looked to me like they were marching in line, War of the Worlds style, over the stark landscape.

Thankfully it's a bit smoother here, likely because heavy use warrants more maintenance. There are tons of people out in the woods today and many of them stopped to ask if I was thru hiking (Yeah, I guess I do have ""that look"" about me). A man and his son told me they hoped to thru hike together someday. The kid was looking at me like I was a rock star...or an alien...hard to tell.

I'm admitadly bias to my home state but I must say that the trail here is the nicest so far.

The water along the trail is a bit swampy but drinkable after filtering.

This afternoon I came across a cloth Old Navy shopping bag left on a rock wall. In it were: a can of baked beans, three cucumbers, and a bottle of Chianti. It was time to cook lunch so I stopped there  and pondered how I might use the ingredients like on one of those cooking competition shows. I've got some olive oil but ate the last of my Parmesan and herbs yesterday, rats! What else could I use: Pop-Tarts? Peanut M&Ms? Powdered milk? No, no, and NO. There're plenty of blueberries around but no tomatoes. My conundrum resolved when three NOBOs came by and took a cucumber and the Chianti. I cooked some rice with bacon, ate one of the cucumbers and left the other with the beans for the next hiker.

We talked a bit and I learned that One Foot started his hike in early March and Autumn started hers just a few days after me.

I met a SOBO while gorging at a Magic Gatoraid and PopTart stash (I forgot his name but it was from Greek mythology). I queried him about camping areas in the White Mountains. It's something I've been concerned about but he assured me that campsites are numerous with plenty of trees for hammocks.

Work Horse and Hills (THAT's his name) were already up and almost ready to go...how do they do that?! At 6 the alarm sounded and broke the sacred morning silence...and I was 100ft away in the privy. After an eternity I got back to my hammock to turn it off and apologized for the major violation of trail etiquette. No harm done as all were up already. WH and Hills left camp about 15 minutes before I did. 
As I hit the trail I immediately knew they had gone SOBO by mistake. You see, the first hiker out in the morning gets to break through all the webs and the spiders were very busy last night. The trail was thick with webs for me to clear: across my face, in my hair, over my arms and legs...like Gulliver in Lilliput. This is the best reason to sleep in every day. 
After about an hour of trailblazing WH and Hills caught up and I gladly let them take the lead. Soon some SOBOs passed by and the trail was officially ""all clear"" for the day. Our work was done: Day hikers - you may begin walking now. (You didn't think all those webs just MAGICALLY disappeared, did you?)

At precisely 1300hrs, in a prime example of precision hiking by all parties, I met my Aunt Penny, Tony, and the other Conway Thursday Hikers at the designated trail location. We enjoyed snacks on the mountain overlooking Cheshire, MA then headed down to the parking area for Magic fruit, muffins, and soda.

I spent much of the day following the trail along the road on nice smooth sidewalks. When the trail went through the woods I took time to photograph the many varieties of mushrooms popping up. It has been a banner season for them due to all the rain. They ranged through an amazing palate of colors from cinnamon brown to red, orange, and blue.

It's worth noting though that these things are available for free along most of the AT, why it's not the case here is a mystery to me. 
The AMC also maintains a series of ""Huts"" that offer meals, lodging, and nice bathrooms. You need reservations to stay overnight there and the cost is over $100 a night. Thru hikers can eat leftovers and sleep on the floor by doing chores, it's called ""work for stay"" and is only available for 2 or 3 each night. I payed to join the AMC to give myself the option of staying in the expensive Huts if I needed to - I need all the help I can get. Unfortunately my timing is bad and they are all booked for Labor Day Weekend. 
I did stop at the Galehead Hut this afternoon for a $1 cup of coffee and sat on the porch for well over an hour enjoying the view. While there I chatted and shared trail info with several passing hikers including ""127"" (SOBO). 
I came across chicken sized bird standing in the middle of the trail. It just stood there looking at me, like chickens do, and only moved to avoid getting stepped on. As you know, I left my Field Guide to North American Birds at home (too heavy) so I can't identify it. I'll call it a Trail Chicken. 
Hopefully I'll have more energy tomorrow. I'm getting close to Mt. Washington and I'd like to tackle that challenge before this spell of good weather passes. Fast or slow, on we go...","Garfield Ridge Campsite

Cloudy but cool today, a good day for walking. The mountains are crowded with weekend hikers. I must have passed over a hundred people, no kidding. It's weird but I've been outside inthe clean air so long I can smell them coming. So many people use Tide! I didn't see anyone who looked like a thru hiker all day. I did see a pair of Trail Chickens. Same as yesterday they just stood there...looking at me. I think they're up to something. 
I stopped mid-day at Zealand Falls Hut for a bowl of soup, coffee, and some snacks to beef up my food bag. It was a flurry of activity there with overnight guests leaving for and returning from short hikes on the many trails crisscrossing the area. 
Hoping for a very early start tomorrow I arrived at this camp and retired before sunset to get plenty of sleep. Unfortunately a large and loud group of Dartmouth students are camped nearby. Oh well, they're just having a good time. At least they're not singing Taylor Swift.

This morning at a road crossing I got some great Magic from Stitches (NOBO class of 1999). She had soda, doughnuts, and a bag of baby carrots (I so miss baby carrots). She also shared info on conditions ahead and suggested I consider flipping up to Katahdan soon and hiking south to finish up. I'm glad she brought it up as it's something I've got to consider. 
For those who don't know: the top of Mt. Katahdan, the tallest peak in Maine, is the official end of the AT. The mountaintop is normally snowed in by mid to late October but some years winter arrives in late September. When that happens thru hikers have to wait at the base of the mountain, sometimes for a week or more, hoping for a break in the weather so they can sprint up the last 6 miles to the finish line. 
I've always imagined finishing my adventure there but at my current pace I won't get there for over a month. 
I'd be a shame if I got all the way to the base of Katahdan only to have Snow Miser slam the door in my face...he's too much. Something to think about while I walk.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602201,"Wow. What a day! I was up at 5am and on the trail at 6:45. Yeah, it takes me a long time to get going. I've given up trying to figure out why...just is. 
By 8:00 I was over Mt. Pierce and Above tree line where I remained for the rest of the day. By 9:00 I was in the clouds, it was windy and damp and got wetter as I climbed.  
I stopped at Lake of the Clouds Hut at 10:00 for a bowl of soup, a brownie, and a cup of tea. I was mindful to eat something at least every hour all day to keep my energy level up, I would need it. 
At noon I arrived at the top of Mt. Washington. Visibility was less than 100ft and the place was mobbed with tourists who had driven or taken the train up. It was bizarre being amongst so many people so suddenly. There was a line of perhaps 50 people waiting to take a picture in front of a sign right outside the gift shop marking the summit. I went to the cafeteria for pizza and chili and answered random questions from several people about my hike (I'm a rock star, a smelly rock star). Then I headed back out into the fog, took some pictures, and wandered around looking for the trail: it was behind the gift shop and I had to cut through the picture line to continue my journey. Then just like that I was alone again in the cloud.
In a few hundred yards I came to the train tracks. The grade is so steep that the train runs up a set of cogs between the rails. I could hear one coming so I waited to take a picture. As it emerged from the fog the conductor pointed at me and everybody waved and took MY picture (rock star). I've heard that it is customary for thru hikers to moon the train as it passes. It goes by so slow though...there must be some awfully cold butts and long awkward moments...just waiting for it to be over. 
The terrain on the descent was awful. Soul and sole wearing jagged rocks, at least they were rough enough so that traction was not a problem. Oh, did I say ""descent""? It was thousands of feet down then UP again time after time over the same rugged rocks all afternoon. I did eventually come down out of the cloud and the views were spectacular. Some rain came through and I spotted a rainbow alongside Mt. Adams, got a great picture! 
My plan was to get below tree line on the other side of Mt. Madison. Yesterday Stitches had warned me not to underestimate the difficulty of that particular section so my intention was to find a camping spot when I got into the woods and finish going down in the morning. Another option would be to stop early and try to get an expensive bunk at The Madison Springs Hut which is 1.5 miles above tree line. About 5:00, as I was nearing the Hut, I heard thunder and could see a storm approaching across the mountains. I kicked it into high gear and got to the Hut just before the wind, lightning, and downpour arrived. 
So that decided it. I'm here tonight, they say it's the first night since June that they have open bunks - sold to capacity all summer. Lucky me! My stay includes a great dinner and breakfast in the morning. Then I'm off again...","Nauman Campsite

It did not and they spent an uncomfortable, if not dangerous night in the storm (I saw them today and they're ok). I was in my expensive bunk looking out as the storm lashed the mountain with 70mph winds - worth every penny. 
By morning all was calm and the sun came out providing incredible views back to Mt. Washington and into the valley below. 
Most of today's hike involved a very steep hike over Mt. Madison and down into Pinkham Knotch where I'm staying tonight. My knees are in bad shape after all the rough trail recently.

For much of the day I leapfrogged Thumper and two NOBO couples: Bunny Tracks, Bear, Sassy, and Easily Forgotten. I sat with them all a couple of times to rest and enjoy the company and good conversation. We are all about the same age and seem to be moving at the same pace so I hope to see more of them in the coming days. 
I stopped at the Carter Notch Hut for another fairly expensive night. Thumper is here too but the others stopped to camp at a stealth site nearby. Getting dinner and breakfast here will save my food supply in case I can't get to the next stop before the weekend. Because of the rocky terrain it's especially important now to pay close attention to my knees and restrict the miles as needed.

I wisely called ahead early to reserve a bunk, others did not and had to find their way 5 miles down Rt. 2 into the town of Gorham for accommodations.
On the trail I met several people including SOBOs ""Mexican Maynor(sp?) and Tommy. Tommy provided some good info regarding my potential flip to Katahdin. Today's leapfroggers were Bo-diesel, Stryder, Bunny Tracks, Sassy, Bear, Easily Forgotten, and Claudia.
Easily Forgotten is suffering from a badly pulled quad muscle which makes going downhill very painful, if not impossible. I wish I'd thought of it earlier but late in the day I remembered I had an ace bandage that the hospital gave me to control the swelling after my snake bite. I'd never used it so I dug it out and gave it to him to wrap his leg. It worked! He made it down and my pack is 3oz lighter, everybody wins. 
I got to the hostel at 5:00 to see several familiar faces. Some, including Jingles (NOBO from CA), zeroed today and are heading onward in the morning. I showered, changed into some ""loaner"" clothes, left my laundry in the bin to be washed overnight, then caught the 6:00 shuttle to Walmart where I bought food for dinner and lunch tomorrow (breakfast is provided). It was a pleasure working in the kitchen as we all prepared our individual feasts. After eating I sat in a very comfy chair to compose this while episodes of  ""The Office"" played on TV.

This hostel has been serving hikers for decades and the elderly ladies who call it home keep it going as a tribute to a husband who loved hikers and passed away some years ago. The place is a bit worn but ok by hostel standards. The 4 Amigos are in the main house sharing a semi-private room, I'm out back in a storage shed/bunk room for 5 but no one else is in here. 
As I was getting settled in I heard lots of voices on the porch and went to see what was up. It was thru hiker ""Pappy"" and a crowd of people from all over town had come to see him. Pappy is a trail celebrity: he's 87 and is hiking the AT for the 3rd time. He was last here in 1996 and stopped in to say hello to the the owners who he hadn't seen since then.

Some words on all the slack packing of late: The five of us probably wouldn't be as far as Rangeley tonight if not for ""slacking"". In hindsight; considering the short distance covered, the extra miles on the ski slope, and the cost of shuttles, we might have been better off spending tonight on the trail.

If they get in again I hope they leave some for me. As I write this I can hear them rummaging through my mostly empty pack as it hangs from the hammock line. There's no food in there so I hope they don't chew any holes. Ahhh nature.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603602,"A very easy 10 miles today. The rain didn't really start until I was almost done setting up camp at 4:00. 
Immediately upon my arrival the squirrels and chipmunks chattered to spread the word that potential food was here. They scurried about, darting quickly onto and into my pack then, when I looked, ran and hid behind the nearest tree trunk. They're waiting for me to slip up. Last night I spent extra time hanging my food ""just so"" and they failed to solve the puzzle. I did the same tonight. If they get my stuff I'll survive as we're headed to a hostel tomorrow to stock up and spend the night. 
It seems I finally got a trail name. The Fantastic 4 have begun to introduce me to others as ""Good Chip Norris"". ""Good Chip"" came from the ladies at Pine Ellis Hostel and the ""Norris"", as in Chuck Norris, is in recognition of my snake bite (see July 32/Aug 1)...""Chip Norris is so tough he got snake bit and didn't know it, AND the snake died"". They don't even know the broken collarbone story from back in Raleigh.
While we're talking injuries here's the current report: I'm hiking with my arm in a ""sling"" again because of my shoulder re-re-injury. I had a minor fall on the other arm and now my right shoulder hurts too. My knees are screaming for time off (at least I'm not limping because they BOTH hurt). I'm also beginning to get a chest cold accompanied by a nasty cough. I have some antibiotics left over from my mid-hike root canal that I'm taking for that, it seems to be working.

The ATC operates a free canoe ferry service here as the river is very dangerous, a hiker did not heed the many warnings not to swim across and drowned here earlier this year. 
We met a couple leaving camp this morning, Cub and Smurf, who have been section hiking the AT for years and the canoe ride was the last bit of trail they had yet to do. When we got to the river I crossed first and had the pleasure of watching them take their final step...out of the canoe and onto the shore. I took pictures for them and off they went, very happy but, I think, not quite believing it's over. Horray for them, well done!
We're staying at a lodge/brewpub tonight and will start the leg into Monson in the morning. We have reservations at a hostel there so we can set up for a long push through the ""100 mile wilderness"" - the wildest and most remote part of the whole trail. So close and yet...

We've been very fortunate that there hasn't been heavy rain here in some time. The brooks and streams are running low allowing easy rock hopping to cross, I had expected to have to wade across most of them. There's some rain coming next week but the woods look like they can take a lot of water before the streams swell. 
We're camped in a beautiful spot tonight. It's a chilly evening, the sky is clear, and the sound of a nearby brook mingles with the voices of my companions as they talk quietly in their tents nearby.

Things are getting more remote feeling every day now: fewer roads to cross, fewer hikers on the trail, less cell reception. There are many stream and river crossings but because of the dry(ish) weather only one required fording and was only shin deep (the guide describes it as waist deep). It's warm enough that I didn't even take my shoes off to cross and they were mostly dry within a few miles of walking. 
We pushed hard to get to this camp and arrived after sunset. It was worth the extra effort as now there are only 9 miles to Monson, the last stop before the ""100 mile wilderness"".

When we emerge from the woods more than a week from now we'll be at the base of Mt. Katahdin. I can't believe I'm so close. 
There are lots of hikers here tonight, many are familiar. Someone is playing guitar outside by the fire while others share trail stories and recall when they first met. The sign in book is full of familiar trail names: people with whom I've shared joy and hardship but will likely never see again. The sense of community is hightened now as we realize it'll be over soon. I'm ready to be home but wish it were possible to keep one foot in this world. The coming days will be precious. 
Early tomorrow we'll have breakfast together, don our packs and walk into the forest one more time. We've made arrangements with the hostel for a ""food drop"" halfway through the wilderness so our loads won't be too heavy.

After an 11:00 start wilderness day 1 was pretty awesome: lots of scenic meadows and ponds, streams and rivers to hop and ford, lunch beside a waterfall, and ridge line walk to survey the brightening fall foliage. 
I'm having fun. We're spread out along the trail most of the day but occasionally we bunch up and converse as we walk, the chatter quiets down a bit on uphills as we work harder and break times are filled with laughs. 
Dispite injuries and sore joints my legs are strong and it feels good to push hard and make good miles. Rain is due in tonight so tomorrow could be a tad miserable but nothing worse than what I've dealt with all along. Piece of cake!

Today, as predicted, was a tad miserable. Occasionally the bright yellow leaves created an illusion that the sun was peaking through - just a tease as cold steady rain fell all day washing away my energy. But spirits are high- less than 100 miles left! 
A section of trail was flooded by a recently constructed dam, the beavers who built it were cozy inside their den. Many downed trees testified to their busy work and the footsteps of many busy hikers had beaten a new trail around the pond. 
Wet leaves, roots and rocks are treacherously slick requiring constant attention to avoid another fall. I'm still hiking with only one pole because of the bad shoulder and am resigned to finishing that way. This afternoon I was so focused on my steps that I walked right into a partially fallen tree leaning over the trail...duh-oh!...not the first time I've done that. 
Soaked to the bone and beginning to shiver we wisely stopped at this camping area well before dark. The others set up inside the shelter because the tent spots are flooded. I chose to use my remaining energy to set up the hammock so I could be more comfortable. I'll be better rested in the morning but getting under way will be difficult, nothing new there. Better weather tomorrow...

We're already going to miss our Friday morning food drop, there's a mountain ahead where cell phones work so we'll call from there and push it back to Friday evening. Everything has to go right over the next few days because we don't have enough food to last into Saturday... pressure is on!
We're beginning to discuss plans for ""summit day"" at Katahdin and a plan may be coming together. I'm looking forward to summiting with my trail family and after we celebrate and say our goodbyes I plan to make my way home (via bus and train) over the course of a few days so I can reflect and decompress. I'm sure some of you have thought about meeting me at the finish but I need to end this adventure as I've lived it: by myself with filthy hikers by my side.

The day started off nice enough with an ankle deep ford across a wide stream then a long but easy climb up White Cap Mountain. We stopped for lunch at a shelter halfway up where I somehow managed to lock myself in the privy. Luckily I had my handy titanium trowel with me and was able to use it to jimmy the latch and escape. To complete the follies I walked into two more leaning trees before the day was out. 
By mid afternoon we had gained enough altitude to be in the clouds and a cold wind knocked moisture from the trees like rain. We were wet, chilly, and miserable when stopped for the night at a shelter tucked into a ravine on the way own. 
Luckily there are only two others here tonight: Rough Start and The General, both NOBO. As the weather is too nasty to set up outside the seven of us are squeezed into the six person shelter. I only have a very thin sleeping pad and will not sleep well. It will be a long night...precious days indeed.

I didn't sleep well last night but today made up for it. It was a chilly but clear, foliage is peaking and it's a perfect time to be hiking here. Deep blue skies provide a backdrop for gazing up at the fall colors, look down and the black dirt contrasts bright yellow, orange, and red leaves. The path is sometimes hard to find under the growing carpet of color reminiscent of walking through fallen rhododendron flowers way back in the spring.
At 2:00, at the pre arranged location, we met Poet from Shaw's Lodging for our food drop. A bucket of stuff purchased in Monson will be enough to get me to the base of Katahdin. 
We're running into SOBOs who presumably started October 1st, they look so fresh and I wonder how we look to them. There was one guy who I saw coming way before he saw me because he was looking down. I was going to stop him and start a conversation but before I spoke up he walked right into a leaning tree. Ha! I told him I'd lost count of how many times I've done that as he hurried embarrassedly by. Not to be outdorked: a short time later I got my feet tangled up while negotiating through some rocks and fell in slow motion downslope onto my back. The others heard me go down and came back to find me stuck there with my pack wedged in the rocks and my feet in the air. I unclipped my pack and Bear helped me up...but not before taking pictures. The follies continue. 
We're camped tonight under the stars and beside a babbling brook. Rain returns late tomorrow so we plan to spend the night 10 miles up the trail at a cool sounding lakefront lodge. I'm looking forward to getting there quickly and enjoying a few hours of down time tomorrow afternoon. Moving on...56 miles to go!","Logan Brook Shelter

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604118,"The morning woke crisp and clear and revealed some stuff piled in the trail a few hundred feet away. Walking up we saw it was a cooler and a box of food: MAGIC! ""Pegamoose"" who had finished his NOBO thru hike 2 weeks ago had driven into the wilderness to work some Magic on the few of us left on the trail. He had soda, candy, apples...and espresso! 
We chatted with him a bit then continued north. The going was super smooth and easy through diverse forest and past several lakes. The maples continue to drop a thickening red carpet to lead the way.
I lingered at a snack break to make some calls and lend my phone to a SOBO section hiker so he could check in with his family. The delay put me well behind and I worked hard to catch up with the group. A few miles up the trail I saw their packs lying trail side and whistled to signal that I was near. My Amigos came up a side trail and told me to follow them but not to look up until they said to. I walked, looking down, out onto a rocky lakeshore and when I looked up there it was: Mount Katahdin!
I hadn't expected to see it for another day or two but there it was, rising up from the horizon, bigger than anything around. The beautiful sight I've been waiting so long for...it made me more than a bit weepy eyed.
We lingered, taking lots of pictures as if to prove it was real, then donned our packs and quietly walked on.
Soon we arrived at the lake where our lodging is located. We called the number posted at the dock and in a few minutes our host, Bill, arrived in an open boat to whisk us and our gear across the chilly waters to hot showers, burgers, and warm beds.

Chip Tillson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604310,"The clock slowed down today, seems this morning was a week ago. I spent the time soaking in the scenery and thinking about how I got here and where I'm going. At the end of the day the trail crossed Abol Bridge where the view of Mt Katahdin filled the horizon - after 231 days the finish line is just a couple more one-day hikes away. So much has gone right to get me here.
There's a saying - ""The Trail Provides"" - and it's true. Every time I neared the end of my rope; hungry, frustrated, lonely, hurt, etc. someone would be there with excactly what I needed. When I was hungry Magic trail side food would be there. When I needed rest and healing friends and relatives welcomed me into their homes. When I was homesick friends came to visit me where I was. When the trail got really tough and loneliness was taking its toll 4 Amigos appeared and saved me. 
As in life I've done my best out here to leave each face I meet a little brighter than it was before. Whenever someone asks ""How are you?"" I grin and reply ""Fantastic!"", bringing home to me the fact that I really am. In return the happy faces of fellow hikers and others brighten every day. Trail Karma indeed.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Upon arrival we set up at our campsite then went to the ranger station to register for our climb up Katahdin tomorrow. They keep track of how many complete their thru hikes and I'm the 1214th NOBOer to arrive here this year. That number sounds low to me. I'm told this years drop out rate is high due to more severe weather than usual. 
Peter arrived from Portland this evening bringing snacks and muffins over which we celebrated Sassy's birthday. Then we chatted longer than usual before retiring. I've been tasked with making sure we're up super early and have set my alarm for 5:50am, brrrrr! 
It's a very steep 5.2 mile climb to the finish line then a slightly longer, but gentler, decent on a different trail. After that we'll pile into Peters car, head to Millinocket for the night and begin to make our ways back into our respective worlds.

We woke right on time with rain pelting our respective shelters - an ominous sign of conditions at higher elevations. The forecast for the next several days was for more rain with ice and snow on the mountain so waiting for weather to improve was not an option. After eating we donned our rain gear and packed only what was needed for the day. Then we stuffed the rest of our gear into Peters car and hiked up the trail together for the last time. 
The forest and leaves were beautiful dispite the rain. We stopped beside a scenic waterfall where Peter left us and returned to the campground: he would pick us up later after we decended on another trail. Peter and his wife Marsha are former thru-hikers and have climbed Katahdin several times. Their help and knowledge of the area greatly eased our finish and eventual return to civilization. Huge thanks to Marsha and Peter: Amigos 6 and 7!
Near tree line the trail turned steeper, eventually becoming an almost vertical climb where we helped each other up, over, and between massive wet boulders. The wind increased markedly when we passed the last stunted trees and the sound of it whipping our rain gear made it imposible to hear each other. Soon the enveloping cloud and driving rain made it hard to see. After a few hours amongst the boulders things leveled out a bit but 50mph gusts and loose wet rocks underfoot made it difficult to walk. All in a days work for this group of grizzled trail veterans. 
After so many months on the trail we all had a pretty good idea when the iconic sign marking the summit would appear through the fog. As we got close I dropped back to let Bunny and Easy walk together while Bear and Sassy kept a few hundred feet behind me. I'd imagined this moment so many times over the years - and practically every day since February. Often my eyes would well up just thinking about it so I presumed I'd be an emotional mess but that didn't happen. Instead I walked with a huge smile on my face, immensely proud and satisfied. 
I spotted the sign just as Bunny and Easy reached it. Then, with 20 feet to go, a huge gust of wind came up and knocked me off balance to remind me who was boss. I fell backwards and landed in sitting position on a flat rock: another humble moment to reflect...then pick myself up and continue. 
We took turns touching the sign and posing for pictures on and around it. Then, with temperatures dropping and a long hike down, it was time to go. 
We had decided to take the Abol trail down rather than the AT (we, after all, we're through with that one). We knew it would be tough going and it certainly was. Much of the route was insanely steep and slippery. Fatigue, rain, increasing winds, and cold added to our difficulties. It took what seemed like forever but dispite some dangerous and tense moments we eventually made our way back below tree line where our struggles were rewarded with a magnificent display of golden foliage. An absolutely perfect ending to one last magical day on the trail. 
Peter hiked in a bit to lead us back to his 5 passenger SUV where the 6 of us and all of our gear squeezed in for the ride to Millinocket.

After a good nights sleep we headed went out for breakfast at the Appalachian Trail Cafe where the ceiling tiles are covered with the names of thru-hikers - now including us. 
The 3 hour ride to Portland was full of trail stories, talk of future adventure, and cake. We all went out for dinner and iced cream then, just like that, it was time to say our goodbyes. Bunny Tracks and Easily Forgotten (now Pam and Curtis) headed off with Marsha and Peter to stay at their house while Bear and Sassy (now Ron and Gina) headed with me (just Chip) to the hotel where we parted in the hallway outside our rooms. 
I headed south in the morning on the 4:25 bus but my Amigos met up once again for breakfast. As I waited for my Amtrak train to depart Boston they texted me a picture of their table as a reminder that we'd stay in touch. We have, and we will. 
The train ride home, changing from Amtrak to NJ Transit in Newark, was just long enough to put me in the right frame of mind to be home. The familiar stations counted down to Bay Head where I donned my pack and stepped off the train for the short hike home. 
Friend Victoria spotted me first and pulled over to welcome me back then I headed to Boro Hall to surprise my former co-workers and the Mayor. Then to my parents house, then home where I made a cup of tea and sat in my chair looking out over the bay while waiting for Joyce to get home.
