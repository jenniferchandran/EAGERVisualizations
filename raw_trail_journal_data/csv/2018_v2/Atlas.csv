Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581874,"It is hard to believe that I am only 58 days away from the start of my hike from Springer Mt. This is a first pre-hike entry in a trail journal that I hope will keep friends and family in touch with where I am and what I'm doing.
It has been a life long dream to hike the entire Appalachian Trail and it was planted by my time backpacking in the White Mts of New Hampshire with my father. He started me backpacking at age 5 on Mt Lafayette and we probably did 5 or 6 trips every year. I completed the AMC NH four thousand footer club when I was 11 so literally grew up with a pack on my back and a love of the outdoors. I later expanded into winter mountaineering, rock and ice climbing as well as other outdoors adventures. After 40 years of professional life and raising a family, I'm now retired and ready to take on this dream. My initial thoughts were to wait till I was 65 but at age 60 my wife encouraged me ""what are you waiting for?"" and so the planning began.
My trail name for this hike will be Atlas after the mythological figure who carried the world on his back... and also the initials AT stand for my name and obviously the Appalachian Trail. It also occurs to me to be much easier to write in trail journals than many of the other trendy trail names currently in use!",,Prep,"Jan 04, Thu",0
Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582428,"36 days to my March 3 start on the AT. I’m training daily with long walks up to 20 miles in length, climbing stairs wells in my Florida condo (11 stories high times 6 reps non stop with a pack is my best so far) and also tackling twice a week Orange Theory workouts that are high intensity power builders. Next week I’ve got a 16 mile full pack shakedown hike on Springer planned so feel like I’m going to be ready to go. Also watching the AT trail weather site daily to get a feel for highs and lows at altitude which ultimately will determine the amount of warm gear I’ll pack. Base weight is between 22 and 25 lbs now but hope to trend it down after the shakedown next week.",,Prep,"Jan 26, Fri",0

Thought I’d take advantage of being at Ammicola and pick up the pack hang tag the ATC is offering to 2018 registered thru hikers but ranger station opened after I started my hike and then closed before I left the park! 
Only saw 7 people on the trails today and all were day hikers. I extended past the summit over to parking lot at Big Stamp and FS dirt road is open but muddy and rutted. 
Silliest thing I saw today was a stack of full Campbell’s soup cans near the summit apparently from someone who thought those would be good provisions for a thru hike and abandoned them after lugging them up the 8 mile approach trail.","Prep

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583652,"It was a glorious blue sky Northern Georgia day as we headed to the summit of Springer Mt, the official southern starting point of the Appalachian trail. I had 7 family members including 3 grandkids accompany me to experience the trail I was about to go live on for 5 months. 
After signing the hidden register we took photos and shared a picnic before heading a mile back to our cars to shoulder my pack and say final goodbyes. 
I marched into the woods and the adventure began. I planned an easy first day and since it was nearly noon I headed for Hawke Mt about a 7 mile distance in. There are many thru hikers starting this time of year and Saturday was no exception. I estimate 80 - 100 hikers of all ages started that I saw on the trail. 
I made camp the first night in a  designated tenting site where I counted 25 tents and 2 hammock campers that were there that night. I met several people, some with trail names and some without. 
It was amazing to see the nearly full moon rise over the hills and light up the woods around me. I learned as well that Georgia is home to a large population of Owls who were active all night long hunting and calling out until dawn. 
It was a great ending to a great first day.","Springer Mt and Big Stamp Gap

Again there were lots of hikers all moving at various paces and styles. Some hikers rush up the trail but tire quickly  and therefore stop to pant and rest until they catch their breath. Others are slow and methodically place their feet in a precise rhythm that allows them to not have to stop, rarely breathing hard but frankly... are a roadblock to other hikers who need to pass them. 
I believe my hiking style is more freeform, more like skiing that changes with the terrain, the light and adventure of the section of trail I’m walking on, not afraid to stop when the views are magnificent or the streams crossing the trail magical in the sunlight but at the same time moving forward at a strong pace and allowing my feet to select alternate paths like from rock to rock or to lightly bounce down one or two rock steps at a stride. 
An example of this was as I ascended the first challenging mountain on the trail Sassafras Mt. It’s reputation and motto among previous years thru hikers is “Sassafras will kick your Ass..” and today was the same with other hikers  panting hard, sitting on rocks, guzzling down their water. I was having a grand time of it, stripped down to my light weigh shorts and a running shirt, generating my own heat. I summited it quickly and was rewarded with views of 30 -40 miles of North Georgia woods. 
At the top I came across an elderly gentleman wearing a Korean War Vet hat taking a standing rest and I stopped to chat. His trail name is Papi and I learned he is doing the AT a second time. The first was at age 65 and now at age 87 would be the oldest AT hiker to complete it. I encouraged him that “slow and steady” wins the race and he quipped back “yeah, well I got the Slow part down”. Happy Trails Papi and thank you for your service to our country! 
At Gooches Gap, I came across a sign stating “ Trail Magic ahead... don’t stop yet” and met MacGyver (trail name obviously) a thru hiker from 2015 cooking hotdogs, handing out chips, cookies, sodas and waters.

He explained that on his hike on the third day he was thinking about quitting and in this same remote spot accessible only by dirt Forest Service roads had someone grill food and cheer him up allowing him to push on and finish the whole trail.

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583793,"A fairly simple traverse over the Blood Mt Wilderness range on day 3. All of this is familiar territory to me and almost on auto pilot with no need to reference maps or guides. 
Blood Mt is significant though as the highest Mt in GA and a fun rocky scramble to the top. It is highly trafficked by tourists and day climbers so it was amusing after 3 days in the woods to pop out among people who hiked up in sandals, lots of selfies being taken and general inexperience. I did take the obligatory photo on top but I have better ones from clearer days. 
I spent the night in Neels Gap in a shared cabin with a trail buddy named Detail. A simple 2 room cabin but included laundry and a hot shower felt great after 3 days. It started to drizzle overnight bringing the string of nice days to an end.","Preacher Rock Mt

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583794,"As expected the morning dawned rainy and socked in with low clouds. It promised to be a wet and long slog to our next destination headed Northbound. As I headed out into the woods all dressed in rain gear I heard faintly my trail name “Atlas” called from a distance and almost didn’t turn around but glad I did. 
My wife drove 2 hrs North from Woodstock to surprise me with Trail Magic! She offered to swap my full 25 lb pack for a daypack and arrange to meet about half way thru the day about 7.5 miles away where the trail crosses a road and there’s a parking area. Even better she made home made chicken soup, brought breadsticks, fruit, candy bars, dry towels and water with the intent of giving it all out to wet miserable hikers (after her husband got lots of all these goodies) at lunchtime. 
The 7.5 miles flew with the lighter daypack she swapped me with and yet I still completed all of those miles of the AT. Some people disagree with the concept of “slack packing” but it only makes sense that the trail is covered by your feet and not necessarily what you carry on your back. 
In any case it made a wet and muddy day into a much more fun and memorable day. In the end we made very good time and distance to a “stealth” campsite just as dark was setting.

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583811,"Conditions have gotten severe with cold and high winds and about the only ways to stay warm are to hike or to be in the sleeping bag. Today was about a 17 mile push till I found a campsite just as the sun was setting. I literally set up my tent, climbed into my sleeping bag to warm up and then cooked dinner (Ramen noodles) from my sleeping bag in the vestibule of the tent. This is clearly an advantage of having a larger 3 season tent with me but it was a trade off carrying more weight. 
Overnight the wind gusted over 50 mph and temperatures were below the 20 degree rating of my sleeping bag so it was a challenging night to stay warm and not have water bottles or filters freeze. Unfortunately I didn’t think about my cellphone battery and backup battery as they both froze and went dead. 
I needed to warm them inside my jacket the next morning to get any juice from either.","Stealth site

I packed quickly and headed the remaining 7 miles into Dicks creek Gap where I arranged a shuttle to take me into the Mt town of Hiawassee where I needed to resupply and rest up at a motel there. I made the 7 miles by noon and was in the lobby of the hotel by 12:30 but the room wasn’t ready yet so I caught up on a newspaper and was offered free pizza by the hotel staff who had leftovers from an employee lunch meeting. Awesome! 
The terrain covered today was much like most of this range with a lot of ups and downs and trail mainly sticking to the ridge line but there is evidence of recent large storms with blowdowns and limbs across the trail in places where trail maintenance crew have had to chain saw thru to clear the AT.

My destination that evening was Standing Indian Mt Shelter which is a location (like many on the southern AT) that I’ve day-hiked at least once. That being said, coming all the way across the range with very steep and long ascents all day meant arriving into camp as the sun was setting making for a hurried and cold dinner and settling in for the night. 
This was the first night I opted to stay in one of the 3 sided shelters that are every 8 - 10 mikes up the AT. It was crowded and literally had 8 of us shoulder to shoulder in sleeping bags. It was not the most restful nights sleep with snoring, wind howling thru the cracks in the walls and the ever present mice in ALL the shelters. 
That being said, you get to know other hikers at these locations and it’s easier packing up in the am without having to pack the tent when it’s cold and wet.","Hiawassee GA

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584093,"Journaling can easily get put on the back burner with the miles needed to be accomplished and the limited cell signal so I’m going to combine a couple days to attempt to catch up. Also rather than the usual “I ate, I hiked, I ate, I slept “ type journals I’m going try each day to identify a unique thing, person or place to give the reader a better feeling of what a thru hike is all about. 
Day 8 was another planned 16 mile to Long Branch Shelter trying to get into Franklin NC ahead of a forecast storm. It was eventful in that we climbed two of the highest Mts south of the Smokies, Standing Indian and Albert with no views from either, as we were in the clouds all day but thankfully no cold rain yet. Also to note was crossing the 100 mile mark on the AT. 
Detail and I stayed a second night in a shelter but this time there were only 4 of us in double decker shelter that could hold 16! Lots of room. Our other two companions were nice quiet interesting hikers but very different. One older gentleman ( I neglected to get his trail name) does not cook on the trail. In fact all he eats is bread (two loaves of wheat at each resupply) and granola bars! Every day. All day. I would get so sick of this but it seemed to be working for him. I’d have dismissed him as a crackpot but he had tons of long distance bicycling experience and one other ultra long hike to his credit. He also was very fast on the trail. 
Our other companion, Culligan Man is a young Chemical engineer on a sabbatical from work after only 3 years at a prominent company. I was very impressed with his experience and focused approach to the hike. We hiked together the next day but again is a much faster hiker than I and everyone moves at their own pace during the day. “Hike your own hike” is the common phrase out here and can apply to a multitude of situations.
Day 9 was a 7 mile hike out to Winding Stair Gap which is the road into Franklin. As forecast, a cold rain started thru the night and into the day but nothing terrible nor insurmountable. 
When Detail and I arrived to the road, Culligan Man had been hitch hiking for 30 minutes and no rides and was shivering. I literally walked over to the road right next to him, stuck out my thumb and the second car stopped and agreed to take all 3 of us right into town and to the Microtel where we stayed the night. Laundry and breakfast was included in our $67 rate so that felt worth it.","Standing Indian Mt Shelter

I arranged a shuttle ride from Franklin back to Winding Stair Gap at 8 am on Day 9 needing to push onto the Nantahala Outdoor Center where I plan to meet my son in law on Wed. Detail and Culligan Man stayed a second night in town to resupply and rest up. My plan was to break the trip into two days, 16 and 11.5 miles but weather went to winter almost from the start. I am an experienced winter hiker/camper and actually prefer hiking in snow to the rain. I got my wish as day 9 was all snow and high winds. This section of trail is known for fine views over wide open topped Mts Siler and Wayah. My only comment is another inch or two and they could turn on the ski lifts (no, there aren’t any). When I reached my 16 mile destination at Cold Spring it proved to be exceptionally high, open, cold and windy and the 6 man Shelter packed with people hanging tarps across the the front to keep out the wind and cold so I pushed on hoping to make Tellico Gap at lower and more protected location. That was a good plan but arriving there showed no flat spots for my tent so I continued up the AT further north (and higher...) until I found a good stealth spot (means unofficial). I set up camp and climbed into the sleeping bag as dark set in before calculating that I’d just hiked 20.4 miles making another milestone on day 9. A 20 miler is an accomplishment and many AT hikers do not make one until Virginia around day 40. I take on the unofficial award of “AT Badass” (meaning strong hiker to the non Thru hiker readers). 
It proved to be an exceptionally cold and windy ridge I was on and at one point had tent poles buckle under the 50 mph gusts requiring me to go out into the dark to repair and in fact weigh down the tent with heavy rocks so it didn’t rip and blow off the mt. 
The next morning I stayed a little longer in the sleeping bag and waited for the sun to warm things up (and cooking breakfast inside the tent vestibule from my sleeping bag). I had a beautiful but challenging 7.5 mile hike across a range to the NOC checking in by 3 pm for a much needed hot shower, good food and a warm bed.","Winding Stair Gap

NOC to Fontana Dam
My thru hike plans included a 3 Day section with my son-in-law and for logistics purposes we decided the stretch between NOC and Fontana Dam would work well with spotting a car ahead and fitting with his vacation schedules. 
We met early on Wednesday morning with snow flakes swirling in the air above the Nantahala River. After repacking some resupply he brought me from GA, we headed out on the first section which is notorious for steep, exposed climbs above the river and valley below. 
We arrived at the first and famous viewpoint “The Jump Up” and met a couple having lunch. I recognized them as “Which Way and Next Step” whom I’ve been following their blog since they started in February. They are a really nice couple newly retired from the Army and very interesting folks. We chatted and exchanged info on the hike and then Bill and I pushed on to the highest summit over the next several days called Cheoah Bald. It is a 5052 foot mt with a grassy summit and in good weather would be an ideal stealth campsite but the cold and high winds had us pushing on towards lower elevations and some wind protection which we found at Locust Grove Gap which had a nice spring nearby. When we arrived, it was only the two of us and one other thru-hiker “Epic”. By dark, every inch of available tent sites and hammock space was filled with thru-hikers. It still was very cold and windy overnight despite diving down to 3700 ft. 
The next day we pushed on and crossed Stechoa Gap and up the notorious “Jacobs Ladder” steep ascent. The upside was warmer temps and beautiful blue skies. We camped at Cable Gap along with 30 -40 other hikers scattered around the shelter and spring. It really showed us how large and how early the 2018 hiker bubble is as every location and section of the trail has lots of Northbound hikers.
Our final day together pushed up and over the steep ridge line to phenomenal views of Lake Fontana and the Fontana Dam which was our destination and where Bill had left his car. 
We completed the hike mid afternoon and Bill dropped me off at Fontana lodge which is the best (and only) lodging in the area other than camping out along the lake. 
Fontana Lodge is stuck in my mind for an incident that occurred a year and a half ago when I did a southbound section hike over the Smokies during an extreme drought and had to ration my water over several days hiking. After arriving at the lodge I went to order dinner and passed out at the table and hit the floor causing the management to call an ambulance thinking I’d had a heart attack. I ended up spending the night in the hospital getting IV’ed with lots of fluids and had to cancel the rest of the three week trip. 
I’m glad to report this did not occur again on this Northbound trip and now tomorrow... up into the Smokies!","Nantahala Outdoor Center

I got an early start out of the Fontana Lodge via shuttle to the Fontana Dam. It’s a long walk along the Dam (largest dam east of Hoover Dam out west) and then up a forest service road to the trail head up into the Smokies. It started to rain just as I got to the trail so donned full rain gear for the day. About 2 hours up the trail it stopped raining and cleared off allowing me to dry out. The climb up to Mollies Ridge is relentless up and up. The Smokies have shelters about every 3 - 5 miles but with the first one already up 9.5 miles.

A sheltered life
This is some insight into hiking the AT thru Great Smokies National Park. The park restricts everyone to staying in the shelters and take reservations for shelter space for section hikers and then first come first served for thru hikers. If a shelter is full, thru hikers are allowed to tent only right outside shelters.  
Shelters sleep typically 12 -14 people in a double deck arrangement. Last night I slept at Spence Field Shelter (notorious for bear sightings) and on the second level deck. At midnight we got hit with a severe thunderstorm and hailstorm that woke everyone. The roof leaked onto our sleeping bags and I pulled my raincoat over my head and my bag to avoid getting soaked. After an hour the storm abated and rained lightly thru the night. 
In general Shelter sleeping is difficult at best with snoring, farting and shoulder to shoulder arrangements. With the leaking roof I maybe got a total of 2 hours sleep before a 7:30 wake up and trail start.","Spence Field Shelter

Push to Gatlinburg 
After the wet experience at Spence Field, the group I’m currently hiking with decided to push on to get down into Gatlinburg for a warm dry night and resupply but that still required another overnight at a shelter 13.5 miles away and then a 11 mile day out to Newfound Gap which is the closest road access to Gatlinburg. 
It is also interesting to note that this section of the southern Smokies is the second most remote part of the trail (approximately 45 miles) with only Maine’s 100 mile wilderness being more remote/road crossing free. 
In any case day 15 started wet and totally socked in with clouds but by the time we’d climbed to the two high peaks of the day, Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mts (appropriately named , no?) the sky started to clear but the valleys below still filled with clouds and rain. It was like looking from an airplane window. The terrain in this area is rough with lots of ascents and descents between many mountains. The destination was Double Spring Shelter which is unique because it sits on a ridge where 30 feet in front of the shelter a spring gushes and flows into North Carolina and 100 feet behind the shelter, another spring gushed and flows into Tennessee. Hence the name, Double Spring.
On day 16, two significant events in the day occurred. One was the crossing of the 200 mile mark of the AT (it’s not marked like the 100 mile point is so we depended on GPS to pinpoint it) and we also climbed over the highest Mt on the entire AT, Clingmans Dome at 6612 feet. We finished the 11 miles in rain and winds and we’re glad one of the guys hiking with us had his wife meeting him in a truck at Newfound Gap and was willing to run us the 18 miles down into Gatlinburg. 
I also realized that at this point, I had hiked 207 mikes in 16 days without a day off and my legs were getting fatigued so made the decision to take what is known as a “zero” day  which means no miles hiked. For reference, a short day like into town is often referred to as a “Nero” meaning near zero. So Gatlinburg would be home for two nights giving me a needed rest, resupply and chance to eat hearty as my hiker hunger has kicked in after two weeks of 5000 - 6000 calories burned each day. Typical meals you can carry replace 2000 - 2500 each day...","Spence Field Shelter

As described in my previous post, my intent was to take a day off ( a zero ) rest up and resupply while the rest of the group I’m hiking with intended to push on the next morning. 
Overnight the weather all across the southeast turned extreme from Tornadoes in AL and GA to high winds and rain turning into snow here in the Mts which was funneling into a major Nor’easter snow dump. The rest of the group opted to stay out of the Mts another day as well (with the exception of Black Dog, a young very strong hiker who wanted to chance it). 
Unfortunately though, when snow and ice fall on the road up to the Newfound gap high pass where the trailhead is, the park service closes the 18 mile highway as they have no plows nor sand spreaders that would be common in NE. 
The road closed at 5 pm yesterday and remains closed to this point with snow, extreme cold and high winds making even tomorrow doubtful turning one “zero” into three which is too much. 
There are many AT hikers up in the Smokies who intended to come out and resupply, warm up, dry off etc that are trapped until it melts and the road reopens. In most cases they will shelter in place to stay warm and in emergency cases, there are restrooms up at Newfound gap that provide refuge. 
Instead we’ve come up with a strategy to leapfrog ahead to Davenport gap just north of the Smokies and with lower elevations. We’ll continue our hike towards Hot Springs and Erwin in the morning. This means each of us will have to come back at some point to finish this 35 mile stretch before the end of the calendar year to qualify as a “thru hike”. In my case, I plan to come back later in the fall with my sons in laws and 14 year old grandson to complete it. 
For those who haven’t been, Gatlinburg is a strange mix of New Orleans Bourbon Street, FL Spring break and a National Park all condensed into one main drag filled with tourists. It gets old in about 30 minutes so two days here is killing me and the thought of three... just shoot me now.","Gatlinburg

Our group of 4 (Crafty, Honey and Moon, Atlas) left Gatlinburg at 6 am and one of Moons friends drove us North around the Northern Smokies to Davenport Gap where the AT continues out of the National Park and starts it’s push north through Tennessee towards Virginia. 
The day after the big Mt snows dawned cold and bright and sunny but again very windy. We had a 16 mile day planned over two significant peaks and started down low in only ankle deep snow. By mid afternoon and at higher elevations we were slogging thru knee and thigh deep snow, very slowly and getting totally soaked. The high Mt Max Patch was beautiful and a totally wide open bald Mt. measured in miles. Think “Sound of music” mountain tops. During the summer they actually graze cattle up there but this day had wind gust of 40 - 50 mph and required pushing on with only quick pictures and the need to get off the exposed peak. 
The next day we proceeded from Roaring Brook Shelter 18 miles to the town of Hot Springs NC. Originally I planned to take 3 days across this steep range of Mts but rainy weather was forecast overnight and in fact for the next several days so I took a spot at a famous AT hiker hostel called Elmer’s Sunnyside Inn which dates back to the 1800’s. It was old and in need of repair but dry and welcoming. They also provide a big hikers breakfast for an additional $6. Great deal. 
I prepped for the next days as no easy resupply exists between here and Erwin TN five days away. I plan a slow departure in the morning as rain is forecast all day with the next several nights in a tent which will get wet and heavy.","Davenport Gap

I got a rainy mid morning start out of Hot Springs after a hearty hiker breakfast at Elmer’s hostel in the 1800’s Inn. They have a simple chalk board sign up the night before to get an all you can eat, made from scratch $6 breakfast. It was worth it and a communal table of 16 hikers. Elmer is in his 80’s and presided over the table having everyone to introduce themselves and talk about why  hike the AT. He was an avid hiker in the 1970’s before he bought the inn and is quite a character. 
The AT goes literally through downtown on Main Street with the blazes engraved in their sidewalk. The town is very proud of their AT trail town designation and the businesses cater to their walking visitors. A great place. 
The hike out of town is steep up and over cliffs that make their own local “lovers leap” with spectacular views down cliffs over a wide and rapid river and of course the last views of Hot Springs. 
I intended to stay that night at Spring Mt shelter located high in a mountain pass about 12 mikes up but as the day progressed it changed from rain to wind driven sleet and snow. At the shelter by 4 pm it was full (6 person capacity)!and the tent sites very wet and exposed to the wind. I made the decision to push on towards a lower Mt pass and the forecast was for downpours throughout the night. 
At about 6 pm I made a road crossing and saw in the guide book a near by hostel would pick me up so I chose to stay in a cabin to avoid the forecasted soaking rain. It turned out to be a wise decision as two days  later I met up with the two people who were in those tents at Spring shelter and had a terrible cold wet sleepless experience. 
The next day I pushed up and over Fire Scald Mt which is rocky and exposed but since the whole day was cloudy and misting I did not get the views I expected. Will have to go back someday. A second large mountain named “Big Butt” also had a grassy wide open Bald but is crowned with house size boulders that stand monolithic above grass and seem out of place as the rest of the area geologically is not made of such rock. It was made all the more eerie as I hadn’t seen any other hikers in 4 or 5 hours and the mountain top was cloaked in thick “Dark Shadows” clouds . 
The other aspect of this section of trail is that the heavy snows of last week are melting and have turned the trail into 6 inches of slush on top of 6 inches of mud. Often there is no way to avoid walking right through it. Several times during the day I went in over ankle deep into mud and my socks and boots are soaked completely through. As a result after almost a month on the trail and 300 miles my feet are giving me problems like rub spots and weird nerve pains in the toes from being cold and wet. 
My friend Craig in Sarasota encourages me to “Embrace the Suck” (a Navy Seal saying that is a favorite of mine) when it comes to adversity like these and I just want to advise Craig I’m “embracing” it for all I’m worth. 
I’m pushing up through a section of TN with beautiful high open Mountain tops called “Balds” and it’s interesting climbing to 5500 feet and then into a mile wide open grass field. In some cases I’ve had views but this is a rainy time of year and most days I’m walking in the clouds like a London fog. 
My goal is to meet my wife in Erwin on Thursday night and I’m actually ahead of schedule so we’ll push the meeting point even further north towards the next town of Roan Mt.","Hot Springs

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585706,"Erwin and the return of the Trail Angel
I arrived at an iconic AT hiker hostel called Uncle Johnny’s that the trail walks right past going down into Erwin TN. They have the usual 20 person bunk room but I opted for a $30 one room cabin with a bed and a small fridge. The main draw though was a hot shower and a free shuttle into town for dinner and a Walmart resupply. I did both and then prepped for the next day with a steep 8 mile hike out of Erwin to a specific road crossing where I was meeting with my wife Kim (my trail Angel!) She arrived right on time to meet me and head off for a good night together. 
Our plan was to take a zero day off in Johnson City TN and catch up after almost a month separated since the start of the Trail. Part of the bargain though was hacking off the month old wire brush graybeard which was easier said than done. 
We stayed at a nice hotel Kim found online called The Carnegie Hotel and it was very classy and old world wood paneling and leather furniture. We enjoyed a great steak dinner, my first wine in a month and a great nights sleep in a large King size sleigh style bed. 
The next day we lazed around over a large breakfast and then tackled hiker laundry. We went to a local laundromat and were surprised that a church teen group was doing “good deeds” that day by paying for and doing people’s laundry. They must have thought my hiker look qualified as homeless!
Another interesting discovery at the hotel was via their bathroom scale where I learned I’ve lost 15 pounds in under a month from burning 5000 - 6000 calories a day! It is impossible to carry that much food to replace what you burn up here.
Alas, all good things must end and we checked out of the hotel and drove back up to 
Indian Grave gap. 
Kim and I hiked up to a bald open Mt called Beauty spot in amazing sunshine and spread out a picnic to enjoy before saying goodbye. Kim hiked 2 miles back to the car and I continued on another 10 miles towards Roan Mt.
 I stealth camped that night in a Apple orchard all alone in my tent and was startled awake about 12:30 to daylight thinking I’d overslept but got out of the tent to realize it was a huge full moon. Back to bed and back to sleep!","Erwin TN

The last of the high mountains, Roan Mt loomed ahead and dominated the next several days. At 6200 feet, this is the height of the Highest Smoky Mts and the last 6000 footer until the White Mts of NH. 
I climbed one of the steep approach trails in a light drizzle that threatened to switch over to sleet and snow as I got higher. My destination for the night was the highest Shelter on the entire Appalachian Trail, Roan High Nob. 
I arrived at about 5 pm on Easter Sunday to see two other hikers at the cabin, one of whom I’d hiked with in the Smokies during the storm, Black Dog. The other hiker was a new face and introduced himself as Sleeves. It was cold and windy so high up and Black Dog decided to eat dinner and push on to a lower elevation for camping even if it meant hiking by head lamp. Sleeves and I decided to settle in for a night and were happy that this shelter was an enclosed cabin with a 4th wall and door as opposed to the typical 3 sided shelter the way most AT Shelters are. It still was cold and damp and snow and ice surrounded the cabin left over from the previous large storms. It was similar to sleeping in a refrigerator! A highlight of the day was getting a Cadbury Cream Easter candy that night from Black Dog. I finished dinner and made hot tea and nibbles on the frozen candy. It was delicious!
The next morning I had some replanning to do as I knew Kim was returning with our Grandkids and my 14 year old grandson planned to hike several days with me on the AT. Their arrival date gave me two shorter mileage days ahead and the opportunity to do some exploring on the grassy topped mountains I needed to climb over before reaching the town of Roan Mt where we were to meet. I also crossed over the North Carolina state line for the final time after having followed and crossed TN and NC lines many times since the start of the Smokies. Moving deeper ino TN also meant another step closer to Damascus VA which starts the largest state on the whole AT. 
After packing up and leaving Roan High Knob, I climbed over several grass topped mountains and aimed for a short day into Overmountain Shelter just ahead of pending rain. 
Overmountain is famous on the AT as it is a converted 2 story barn high in the Mts and officially sleeps 24 people but is famous for fitting 40 in a storm! It has a beautiful view over a wide open meadow, sliding barn doors and looks down into a remote valley. Unfortunately it also has mice! Lots and lots of mice and I laid awake a lot of the night swatting away mice from my sleeping bag and one from my head (I sleep in a stocking cap that it must have thought would make a fine nest!). 
I had one more day to slow down with to make my rendezvous with Kim and the grandkids so I hiked out to a new hostel in the trail town of Roan Mt . The owner also has recently opened a craft beer pub called “the station” and they take pictures of thru hikers enjoying a “pay it forward” beer so you can see a picture of who “bought” you a beer. It was fun and they have food delivered there from various restaurants in town. 
I had one last 4 mile stretch to meet the kids at a road/trail crossing so started early the next morning in the rain and then met exactly at 10 am as planned. 
Along the way I surprised 3 large Deer who waited until I was about 20 feet away before jumping high into the underbrush before running away. Come to think of it... who surprised who since I was quite startled myself as they were very well blended in with the landscape until I came too close.","Erwin

Hiking with my Grandson 
For several weeks we’ve been planning a rendezvous with Kim and our two oldest Grandchildren, Carter and Elle.  My 14 year grandson is an avid outdoorsman and a high school athlete so when Spring break in GA coincided with some particularly beautiful sections of the trail it seemed a great plan. Kim made a great sacrifice in driving back and forth to Atlanta twice in two weeks but was willing to do so for the sake of making memories. While the boys were planning to hike, the two girls secured a mt cabin in Beech Mt NC,  about 45 minutes away from where we planned to meet. 
Since Carter hadn’t been hiking 16 -18 miles a day we agreed to start with a 7 mile day trip/slack pack which coincided with my crossing the 400 mile marker at Jones Falls and then past the spectacular Mountaineer Falls. It was an awesome day filled with exploration, snacks (at this point I’m eating like a teenager myself), good conversation and lots of questions from my Grandson about what this adventure was really like. We met the girls at end of the day and went with them back to the cabin allowing me to do laundry, shower and have a great meal with the family. 
The next day we packed up for a 14 mile two day backpacking overnight so Carter could experience life on the Appalachian trail and share in some great memories.  We explored again, climbed several Mts in this Hampton range and ended up camping overnight at a beautiful open meadow high on a mountainside. Carter is a “hammocker” so we located a great site where he could set up and I could have a flat site for my tent. We found lots of firewood and a bubbling spring about 150 feet from our campsite. We put Carter to work on building a roaring fire as we brought Steaks in tinfoil to cook over the coals along with soup, instant “loaded” mashed potatoes and tortillas to hold the steaming juicy steaks. We finished the feast off with a rare treat courtesy of Mt House, freeze dried ice cream sandwiches. Yup, there is such a thing and it was yummy (Thank you Kim and Steve Sapp!). We sat around the fire till hikers midnight (9 pm) and then turned in. We both awoke at 12:30 though as the moon rose, lighting up our meadow and Coyotes started to howl in the near distance. They stayed on their side of the meadow and we stayed on ours!
The next day we had an easy 4 mile hike out to the car at a trail crossing and where the girls were creating trail magic for AT through hikers. They provided pizza, beer, sodas, chips, candy bars, and the best largest PB&J sandwiches ever, made by my granddaughter Elle. It was awesome and there were 4 or 5 hikers sprawled out on the grass next to the car getting their fill before continuing. 
At last I had to say goodbye to the kids and my wife (who I won’t see again until Harpers Ferry WV). It was emotionally the hardest goodbye so far on my trek and I walked off into the woods wiping some tears after hugging and kissing everyone goodbye. I know I am resolved to complete this adventure of a lifetime but after over a month I sure do miss my family! 
I needed to get up and over a couple of significant obstacles to the other side of Hampton TN before rain changing to snow started that night. I first descended sharply into a gorge where the best waterfall yet on the AT is, called Laurel Falls. To get there involved lots of steep stone steps, climbing through steep V-shaped chasms with recent rockslides to scramble over and in some places the foot wide trail skirted cliffs right at a rushing river only a couple of feet below the crumbling trail. In any higher water situation this would not be passable without some serious rock climbing while wearing a 20 lb pack. 
I made it up and over the gorge and a 3 mile climb over the mountain as the rain began to fall. Originally I had planned to tent near Wautaga lake but due to aggressive bears in the area causing the first section of the trail to be restricted for camping would have had to push on another 7 mikes which my legs and heart didn’t have in it. I stopped at a famous hiker hostel called “boots off”, grabbed a bunk room and got in out of the rain. Again, this spring is proving to be more severe in both rain, snow and cold than previous years and it’s causing many hikers to drop out, delay or suffer the dangers of hypothermia. 
The next 43 mile stretch of the Appalachian trail runs South to North across the VA line and into Damascus VA which is known as Trail Town and the AT runs down Main Street and the community supports and caters to the hikers coming through. My original plan was to cross this range in 3 days but the rain changing to snow caused me some concern. 
The owner of the hostel though proposed an alternative if we could find 4 hikers to share in the cost. They would drive us to the 20 mile mark where a mountain road passes through a gap and we’d slack pack (light weight daypacks) 20 miles back from North to South, stay another night at the hostel and the next day we’d return to the same high pass but with our full pack to complete a 23 mile Northbound hike into Damascus. 
I’ll share more about those two days in my next post.","Roan Mt

Boots off hostel and the push into Damascus 
As predicted, the skies opened up and rain fell heavily the first night at Boots Off Hostel. They are right off the trail and are a pretty regular stop even for those not staying there. I had a small (8x8) rustic cabin with 3 bunks in it but all to myself. The tin roof was loud with the downpours pounding on the roof all night. 
In the morning, 4 hikers had signed up for the 20 mile slack pack Option and we loaded into a Suburban SUV at 8 am for a twisty, bumpy ride to about the half way point between Hampton TN and Damascus VA where the AT enters the state of VA and probably the most famous “trail town” on the AT. 
We only packed lunch and waters and a couple of emergency items into daypacks loaned by the hostel and then started an all day hike back Southbound to the hostel. It was strange to be southbound and then to meet other thru hikers still headed North and see their reaction, like “say, don’t I know you?” 
The forecast was for rain changing over to sleet and snow during the day and it didn’t disappoint. All the hikers moved at their own pace but we crossed paths several times during the day. I walked into the hostel about 5 pm after a cold but exhilarating hike along the Watauga ridge line in  thick clouds all day. It’s too bad as the views over Wautaga lake are supposed to be phenomenal from this ridge of mountains but that day was like 10 foot visibility. 
There is also a shelter along this section of the trail that has had to be closed due to aggressive bear activity and I hiked right by it late in the day. It was a little spooky to be here by myself but I kept a close watch out and moved along without stopping at the shelter.
The next morning we got shuttled back up to the same spot about midway and had a 23 mile hike into Damascus but overnight the snow had accumulated from 3 -6 inches and made for a cold but beautiful hike across high mountain passes and open fields. The highlight of the day though was crossing the VA/TN state line making the fourth state I’ve hiked in so far on the Appalachian trail. 
I’d booked ahead for two nights at the Dragonfly Inn in downtown Damascus preferring a private room and bath vs a shared bunk room at a hostel and this inn also has a reputation of making excellent and plentiful breakfasts. Both mornings I was totally satisfied and filled up with a custom cooked to order breakfast. Still trying to stop the hiking weight loss from continuing and have cinched up my belt as far as I can on my hiking shorts.
The rest of Damascus frankly was a little disappointing with very limited restaurant selections and hiker resupply stores.    I know the town is historic and the junction of several famous trails and not just the AT but it felt almost abandoned this early in the year. 
I also unfortunately bruised up the bottom of my feet coming the last six miles into town on very sharp rocky trails. Very painful and frustrating that after almost 500 miles of fairly minimal foot pain and no major blisters to now be hobbling around. I had already planned a rest day here and I spent it soaking my feet in Epsom salt baths and lying in bed trying to heal up! 
At the inn on the second day I also met “Vagabond Jack” at breakfast who is another blogger here on Trailjournals.com that I have followed since he started in early February. I had assumed he was far ahead of me but I guess he’d backed off on his miles while mine have gone up considerably. He is an interesting guy and is having a great hike so far. 
I packed and prepped to head out of town the next morning eager to be exploring this new section of trail in Virginia.","Hampton TN

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587087,"Mt Rodgers and the Greyson Highlands VA
The trail out of Damascus starts on Main Street but then climbs steeply out of town with nice views back into downtown. One of the other trails running into Damascus is the Virginia Creeper trail which  is a converted railroad now used for Mt Bikes and hiking. The AT crosses the Creeper trail several times up into the mountains and walks on the bike path for a couple of miles. I camped that night at a shelter called Lost Mt and I can confirm “I found it!”. There was a large group of thru and section hikers all headed north and we shared a roaring campfire and stories of the trail. 
The next day I climbed up and over the highest Mt in Virginia called Mt Rodgers and into Grayson Highlands State Park. 
The trail crosses a Mt gap road and there I found trail magic in the form of a 2018 thru hiker “Grumpy” who injured himself one week into the hike so he and his girlfriend “Gucci Girl” now are traveling north with the hiker bubble in a van with a complete gas griddle and kitchen supplying food and comfort to hikers every day. In this case, he made fresh pancakes and scrambled eggs for those coming through. I had already eaten my trail lunch but so as to not disappoint him I ate 4 pancakes and 4 eggs as a second lunch but another young hiker I was with that day ate 12 pancakes and 6 eggs! His trail name had been previously “Ridge“ but I have renamed him “IHOP”.
This area of Virginia is also famous for wild ponies who roam the open mountain summits. They have become fairly tame and approach the hikers expecting pats and snack handouts. There are hundreds of them in this 20 square mile area and originally were released here by the Park service to keep the mountain tops cleared of brush and trees.
This area also contains the 500 mile milestone on the AT. The trail at this point also goes through a boulder tunnel that requires a crawl and just barely fits your shoulders through. It’s called “Fat man squeeze”. At this time of year and this high altitude the cave was filled with snow and ice requiring me to crawl on all fours but i was in hiking shorts! I crawled fast! 
In this area, in addition to being concerned with bears at nighttime the wild ponies are known to knock over tents or chew on hikers hammocks in search of those snacks I mentioned earlier. The group of hikers I was hiking with at this point opted to stay in Wise shelter rather than chance a run in with the wild ponies. The water sources here also need to be fenced in so the horses don’t foul the water.
The Grayson Highlands tapers off into lower gentler mountains and valleys on the path north. Crossing open meadows that are used for grazing cattle, the trail goes through multiple gates that hikers have to open and close and latch behind them. It seems unusual after crossing the wide open mountains and forests of the first section of the AT. I hiked a 20 mile day across these rolling mountains and set up camp in the dark just above Trimbi Shelter. At this point setting up a tent is almost automatic and I even kindled a small campfire in parallel with set up. 
Along the trail in Marion VA there also is a famous shelter called Partnership Shelter which due to closeness to a road allows hikers to order pizza delivery or even to catch a bus into town. It also has running water (cold showers) and a second floor so it sleeps about 16. I didn’t stay the night here as I passed it around 3 pm and wanted to continue further north with the remaining daylight. I stealth camped that night high on a ridge with an amazing view of a sunset and a sunrise the next morning. But I also woke up at 12:30 am to the howling of a pack of coyotes bringing down a kill nearby on the mountain. Again being in a tent by yourself in the middle of a mountain range can be both a great experience and a scary one. I slept “lightly” the rest of the night. 
The next day was a medium distance hike out to Atkins VA where the AT crosses under the major North South route 81. The trail goes past a early VA settlers museum and a one room school house where a local church placed trail magic for thru hikers in the form of sodas, crackers and granola bars. They hit the spot on a warm and sunny day.","Damascus VA

After getting the school house trail magic on a warm day, I saw there was a hiker friendly motel near the highway underpass where the AT goes under Route 81 and up into the next several mountain ranges west of the major North South inland highway. 
“Hiker friendly” in this case means cheap, with coin op laundry and food options nearby. Unfortunately the “Relax Inn” has seen better days (my guess is those days were in the fifties when I was born!) and really should have major renovations but in any case, I made do and ate very good Mexican food nearby for dinner and the next morning as I was headed out to the AT grabbed a hiker breakfast at a semi famous trail stop called “The barn”. 
I ordered the “hikers special” which is a basically a large order of two of everything they make for breakfast and comes out on two large platters. I’m starved every morning and can feel I’ve lost even more weight in the past very intense week of hiking in the Greyson Highlands and know I’ll have no problem finishing this but the waitress says “ now hunny, do you want low calorie, sugar free syrup with that?” I said “huh?? Umm, no! I’ll have the extra calories , extra sugar version please!” She laughed and said she should have known better for a thru hiker. 
I headed up the trail feeling full but knowing a steep morning climb waited ahead of me to burn it off and the weather was threatening thunderstorms and heavy rain which can be dangerous on exposed mountain summits. 
The sky opened up on me about noontime and it felt like someone was spraying me down with a hose. I have good mountain rain gear and a rain cover for my pack so I slogged on. The trail became like a muddy stream and in several cases I was climbing up and down waterfalls where the Trail normally would be. 
In the middle of this deluge, I passed a sign “Quarter way point to Maine”. I snapped a quick picture and remembered there is a hiker hostel called “Quarter way Inn” the next road crossing so I opted to walk there instead of pushing up towards 4000 foot Chestnut Knob which was my original destination for the night. 
I dried out and the Hostel stay included laundry so all the muddy wet gear I’d just hiked in got  washed and dried a second time in two days! The hostel owner (a former thru hiker called “Chunky”) told me snow and sleet were expected the next day but one option for getting some miles in would be a Slackpack shuttle to a gravel forest service road 20 mikes up range and to hike back south to the Inn where I could stay a second night and get dry before continuing on the push Northbound. I agreed and spent the next day at high elevations in 4 inches of blowing snow and ice. At this point it really should be warming up as it is Spring after all! 
On my way back to the Inn I encountered two hikers headed up the trail who tell me the river in the valley below has flooded and the AT has been re-routed temporarily but they just went ahead and took off boots and waded waist deep across the river. That doesn’t seem very smart to me but “Hike your own Hike” applies even here. I opt for the re-route that adds miles to my return hike on top of the 20 including road miles which are the worst for a thru hiker. We love the trail experience and walking on roads in the rain and snow are not fun. 
The following day was supposed to be clearing and warming during the morning but when the shuttle driver dropped me off high in the mountains it still felt freezing cold and a high wind. Luckily the route this day dropped to lower elevations after about 8 miles up high. It did warm up and I crossed over Interstate Route 77 and ended my day at Harvey Mill Shelter where I tented in a large pine grove. The shelter was about 3 miles from the interstate and I could still hear cars and trucks way down below the ridge that the shelter sits on.","Atkins VA

On the morning after my nice rest in the Pine grove, another hiker pointed out to me the large number of huge dead branches high in the large pine trees over my tent. Lumberjacks used to call these “Widow makers” for a good reason and I envisioned having a 200 pound dead branch plummeting to the ground and spear right thru my tent! I resolved to check diligently every time I set up the tent in these woods where dangers can often come from above. 
I hiked along a ridge line in a north easterly direction. My ultimate destination for this leg was Pearisburg VA but the distance was more than a days hike so I planned to stop at a scenic waterfall called “Dismal Falls “ that my guidebook indicated had tent spots all up and down it but was a half mile side trail off the AT but a worthwhile detour.
I arrived shortly before dark and scouted out a good site near the falls but not too close as I saw a number of fishermen on the other side of the river which I had read was accessible to town by dirt roads and can be a bit of a “party” spot. The water was high from the previous days torrential downpours and melting snow and the falls were spectacular. 
I set up camp and lit a campfire as dusk was setting in, really more to keep away black flies than for warmth at this point of the trip. While tending the fire I caught something move out of the corner of my eye and turned to see a stranger in fishing waders just standing quietly 30 feet away at the edge of my site watching me. I said “hello” and his reply immediately set me on edge “are you alone?”. I lied “no, there’s 3 - 4 more hikers coming down the trail to meet up here” but I knew there were no other AT hikers camped on my side of the river. He walked over and sat down next to my fire about 5 feet away and explained the river had just been stocked with trout that afternoon and that’s way there were so many fishermen out. He offered me fish he had caught but I explained lite weight hikers don’t carry frying pans, butter or even tinfoil so I had no way to cook it and in fact all my meals are made with boiling water. He looked at me as if I had two heads and surely “ a damn furriner “ while chewing and spitting tobacco juice into the fire. At this point I’m hearing banjos (Deliverance) and keep a 3 foot piece of firewood at hand in case I needed to bash him up side the head. As it got dark he went on to tell me of the gruesome twin murders in a AT shelter in the late 80’s just near these very falls called Wapiti Shelter (I was aware of them and knew the history as most AT hikers are aware of the smallest possibility of Crime on the trail. ) 
He then continued with other “spook” stories about other crimes and examples of hillbilly justice including a Mexican standoff he and a buddy had just the previous year with a strange hunter who leveled his shotgun at them and they pointed theirs at him until everyone backed out of sight. 
“Gee, thanks for all the local history I said. Maybe you should try hiking the AT sometime since you live nearby... “ Finally as it was getting dark he stood and walked back to the river “y’all be careful out here now” with a final squirt of tobacco into the fire. 
I stoked the fire up high and sat up late listening for sounds around me. In the end it was all harmless and I guess just his way of reaching out to strangers who walk through his county on the AT. I confess I did find a good size rock and brought it into the tent in case I needed to crack open someone’s head during the night... !
My destination the next day was a famous hostel “Woods Hole” in a valley high above Pearisburg. My wife’s cousins daughter, Sofia is working there this spring after ending her Northbound thru hike last year there. I reserved two nights there and meals and made arrangements to do a day-hike “slackpack” style the next day with Sofia (trail name Blue) on her day off. That way I’d get the 14 mile section done but also get to hike with Blue as we did last year. 
The hostel is a working farm with animals and crops and extremely picturesque. Blue and I caught up on each other’s trail stories, enjoyed some great home cooking (everyone pitches in to cook and clean up) and we resupplied me for the next leg of my trip into Daleville, VA","Helvey Mills Shelter

Since I had completed the 14 mile Woods Hole to Pearisburg segment of the trail as a slackpack the previous day, I was shuttled down to Pearisburg by the hostel owner , Neville (an amazing and wonderful woman who bonds to everyone who comes through her hostel). The next section of the trail climbs steeply back up 5 miles to a high open Ridge line running Northeast with lots of open fields and view points but with very limited water so I loaded up 4 liters of water from one available spring and carried the extra weight for about 8 miles to a open mountain top campsite with room for about 4 tents although I was the only one up there that night. Very windy yet magical with the lights glittering down in the valleys below.
The following day was another 18 mile day down off a ridge and up onto another and another... and another but I had the good fortune to reconnect with a hiking buddy , Craft E who had gotten off-trail to attend his citizenship ceremony back in Florida and had his daughter Jessica come from CA to join him for a week of hiking. We passed each other several times over the course of 4 days and I was amazed that Jess was able to jump right in with 18 and 20 mile days. Most AT hikers start with lower mileage and then work up to this level but she was determined not to slow her Dad down.
We knew that bad weather was in the forecast but weren’t sure if it was going to impact our trips up and over the two big iconic peaks in this area , The Dragons tooth or McAfee’s Knob but it gave a sense of urgency as we pushed on making long mikes each day. We actually got the heavy rain a day early on the approach towards Dragons tooth and I along with 7 other wet hikers opted to pile into a 6 person shelter rather than setting up tents in the soggy, muddy forest. Yes, that’s as crowded and uncomfortable as it sounds and everyone is wet without any real chance of drying out or warming up unless in a sleeping bag. A new Olympic sport is conceived, “ synchronized sleeping bag rolls when in shoulder to shoulder conditions with wet thru hikers“. 
The Dragons tooth range is known for jagged, rocky peaks in a series of ascending summits ending in the “Tooth” which is a side trail, steep rock scramble difficult on a clear dry day. This area is known for its fine views along the entire range but the day I climbed it, the heavy rain was blowing In sideways, mixed with sleet and wet snow flakes above four thousand feet and it was hard to see the next White blaze as the peaks were up in the clouds. 
After two monsoon like days, I was soaked to the skin and my waterproof pack rain cover was holding more water in than out. It’s hard to over-emphasize how much heavier gear is when soaking wet and even the best raincoats and rainpants get wet all the way through. I and several others in the group made plans to head towards a hiker hostel/bunk room called Four Pines that night which was within walking distance of the nearest road crossing beyond Dragons tooth so there was hope of drying out and sleeping in a bunk instead of a wet tent that night. But once on top of Dragons tooth, there is a spectacularly steep drop over cliffs which the AT follows down to that road crossing. I actually love rock climbing and have a high confidence in my ability to climb steep cliffs but this day the cliff was literally a waterfall so very slippery and hard to follow the painted white blazes as they were now under mud and rushing water. In places, the drop below you is 50 feet enough to kill or cripple you and a long way out to medical help.
At one point the trail has fixed metal ladder rungs down a sheer face and descending that ladder with a 20 lb backpack while getting a waterfall pouring down on you from above I had to admit fear, some doubt that I could finish and strangely even humor causing me to laugh out loud at the absurdity of the toughness of the AT that particular day. To this point, it is the only day I remember that I contemplated giving up! 
Eventually the 18 mile day came to a close after the harrowing down-climb of the tooth and I walked the extra distance to the hostel only to find 30 people already there for 16 bunk positions. The owner offered to let the overflow sleep in the unheated hay barn but being soaked and now shivering from exhaustion and cold wetness, five of us made arrangements for a shuttle to come get us at the hostel and take us to a motel in Dalesville VA to dry out and then return us to the trail head the next morning to push on. Ironically the hotel we chose, (a HoJo’s which I admit I thought were long out of business) was exactly where the AT comes out and crosses the Interstate and in fact I would stay here again in two more days hike. 
The next morning, somewhat dried out and rested, we returned to the trail for the next section which leads up and over two famous sections of the AT, Mcafee’s Knob and Tinkers Cliffs. Virtually every book, movie or poster about the AT has a photo of Mcafee’s which is a high pointed overhanging cliff looking into a peaceful and serene valley. AT Hikers sometimes will time their hike to be on top only on good days or at sunrise or sunset etc. However the day Craft E, Jess and I went over it was on and off rain and I got my iconic photo taken standing inches from the precipice in a light rain and blowing wind but hey... I’d just climbed down a raging waterfall the previous day so this was pretty tame in comparison. 
I tented that night at a designated campsite a mile below the cliffs and met an older gentleman whose trail name is “Loner”. He’s in his early 70’s and his hiking shirt already holds THREE 2000 miler badges which are only awarded for completing the AT and he’s now on his fourth time through. Respect to Loner!Only a AT hiker really knows how hard this is to achieve...
I hiked the next day back into Daleville and the same HoJo’s I’d stayed at 2 nights previously and ate that night at the AT hikers famous Three little Pigs Barbecue where the food is plentiful, the craft beer is cold and they give hikers a free massive banana pudding desert. 
How do they know AT hikers from say, regular tourists? That would be the ones who eat two meals at once, have a certain smell that multiple showers won’t wash off, have long hair and scraggly beards and aren’t ashamed of eating out around town in gym shorts, a rain coat and flip flops while the laundry is finishing. They also like to sit outside and when a light drizzle starts during the meal and the waitress comes to ask if you’d like to move inside out of the rain, you cast an eye towards the sky and smile saying “That ain’t rain...”","Pearisburg VA

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590561,"A Dalesville zero and onward to Lexington VA
I chose to insert a zero day “little to no walking” in Dalesville as the bottom of my feet were feeling bruised and swollen. I bought Epsom salts and new cushioned boot sole inserts and resupply food enough to get me up to Lexington VA where my cousin John and his wife Val recently have moved and had invited me for a stop over. 
After soaking the feet a few times and elevating them with a couple of naps I felt ready for the next section of the hike and set out the following morning at dawn planning a long day. I also noted the weather had changed and was getting warmer each day and more humid which dehydrates you faster and wears a hiker out. Actually from this point forward I determined to set an alarm and start no later than 7 am to keep my mileage high and to break and rehydrate during the noon hot sun as well as taking off boots and socks to air dry out my feet which was causing swelling and soaked, wrinkled skin. Up to this point on the hike, I’ve just been eating trail snacks for lunch while walking, never taking the boots off and sitting only once or twice all day! Seasons change and so the hiking style needs to change too. 
A mile outside of Dalesville, I crossed the third of the way milestone Mark, 730 miles out of 2190. It’s important to note that every year the trail length changes due to relocation, trail closures, etc so anytime there’s a “fixed” sign to a tree, paint on a rock or something, it’s usually wrong! But by using a AT GPS enabled device (I use an App called “Guthook” which has the entire AT mapped out) you can determine the accurate milestone and often such markers are temporary and written in sticks, stones or something on the trail. 
In any case, my long hike out of Dalesville was pleasant and gradual back up to the Blue Ridge mountain range tops. I had a interesting encounter on the trail with two southbound backpackers that first afternoon on a long, narrow,  gravelly switchback. The two guys were sweating heavily in the afternoon heat and the lead guy in a army style bucket hat said “hey watch out, there’s a fat timber rattlesnake ahead 100 yards on the trail” which got my attention and to stop and chat a bit without rushing up the trail. The guy seemed really familiar but out of context and then I placed him as Steve Brand,  a guy from church in Marietta GA that we attend when we are there. It turned out he and his friend do 100 mile sections of the AT each year and this year happened to be going southbound into Dalesville at the same time I was Northbound and just in time to warn me of a rattler. Coincidence or not? 
In any case I’m not very afraid of snakes just certainly cautious but up to this point on the trail have only seen 3 or 4 large non-poisonous black snakes on the trail and only one copperhead. I use my trekking poles often as defensive probes in areas where snakes are likely to be found and have “helped” more than one off the trail with them. 
After 10 minutes chatting I hiked on up the trail thinking, “this trail is only 12 inches wide and it’s a steep drop off to the left and steep incline to the right, how am I going to get past this snake” but as often happens it had slithered off the trail on its own. (Steve later showed me a video of the snake rattling once they got past it). 
I hiked that day until dark and stealth camped at a nice spot high on a ridge. I found another young hiker already there named “Steak” from Oregon who hiked the PCT last year and a truly ultra light hiker as he spread out a piece of clear plastic and laid out his sleeping bag cowboy style on the ground (no tent, no hammock, no sleeping pad, no stove and as far as I could tell no steak!) I asked what he did when it rained and he admitted he had a tarp he’d pull over top of him. That night started nice (he was asleep by 6:30) but winds gusting to 30 mph rattled my tent during the night and I can’t imagine steak had very much fun sleeping but he was up and gone when I got out of my tent at 6am. 
The next day followed and crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and pushed me up and over a ridge near Blacksburg VA where my son in law Bill Morrill attended Virginia Tech and it included up and over the high point of the range called Apple Orchard Mt which is a grassy open mountain with a huge “sci fi” looking FAA navigational dome structure. 
As I left the smooth grassy top of the mountain the trail surprisingly drops into a steep rocky gully where a famous landmark called “the guillotine” is located. It’s a large rock balanced and wedged that the trail passes under, seemingly ready to drop at anytime. I reflected that even though it likely has been there securely for a million years, for the past 100 years, AT hikers have hurried up a little bit when they pass under it. I know I sure did as the sun was setting and I walked alone down the trail. 
My destination that night was a Shelter (only because it had a guaranteed water source, a spring while many water sources on the trail are now starting to dry up) on Thunder Ridge (any guesses on why it’s named that?). 
I also experienced trail magic half way up Apple Orchard Mt where I met a couple sitting at a trail junction drinking beer and they said they were overnight campers headed out and offered me a local craft beer which I carried in my pack up to the shelter and enjoyed a semi-warm beer with my gourmet ramen noodle, siracha sauce and pepperoni dinner. The real trail magic though was when one of the other young AT thru hikers named Database showed up at dusk and told the same story and took one but he didn’t drink beer so he gave me the one he’d just carried up the mountain for me! Beer is heavy and not anything a AT hiker would ever plan to carry but at this point the calories are hard to turn down! Also the next day I knew I would cross the BRP again where there are trash cans to properly dispose of the squished empties! Carry in/Carry out was practiced in this case! 
The destination the next day was to meet my cousin at a specific road crossing on Rt 60 closest to Lexington VA where they recently have moved. I had arranged a 4 pm meeting time and it is often said on the AT “you can pick a time or pick a place but it’s hard to pick a time and place to meet”. I pushed hard in the heat 18 miles and walked out at the crossing at 4:05 so not bad considering there had been an unknown trail relocation due to a rotted bridge crossing a river that added a mile to my day. 
It was great to get picked up and my cousin wisely brought his convertible with the top down to shuttle a sweaty and smelly AT hiker back to town for a shower, laundry and excellent meals trying to put some weight back on me as I stepped on the scale to learn I’ve lost 20 lbs since starting 2 months before! 160 lbs... I was 155 in high school so this is getting scary. 
Most AT through hikers burn through 3 to 4 pairs of boots on their trip. After 800 mikes I was still in my original Merrill Moab ankle high boots and tread still looked good but I’d noticed my toes were jamming up against the front and sides causing numbness and pain so while I was stopped I determined to replace them with a bigger and lighter pair. My cousin helped shuttle me to a couple of outfitters to find the right size and type which have really helped fix the foot pains. My street shoe size for years has been 10 1/2 and I’d bought 11 wide boots knowing this would happen but the outfitters measurements show my foot is now a 12 wide!! At least it’s fixed but I’ll have to deal with replacing a lot of shoes when I get back home.","Dalesville

After resting up and resupplying in Lexington my focus was on the next push up to the Shenandoah National Park which is among the most beautiful along the AT and a section which I had never hiked. My cousin dropped me at the trailhead on a warm morning and I hiked back up to the height of the ridge. Before the mellow Shenandoah though, one has to hike up a long curvy ridge known as the Devils backbone due to sharp rocky Mts and numerous climbs and descents each day. There are many great views from these cliffs so in some sense you are rewarded for the labor up the steep inclines. At this point in the trip, long days and strong legs make for 20 -25 mile days and the climbs have become second nature. 
My first night in this section I planned to camp high on a ridge called Spy rock that was used during the civil war as a army spotting post. There is no water up there so the plan was to locate the closest spring or stream and fill up enough to prepare dinner, breakfast and refill water bottles for the next day which usually comes to 4 liters total. Water is heavy and at the end of a long day extra weight is not usually welcomed but the pay-off of camping high where it’s cooler and a nice breeze keeping the bugs to a minimum is worth it. I hiked most of the day and camped at Spy rock with another AT hiker “legs” who is obviously tall and lanky and so earned his trail name but he is the fastest through hiker I’ve met so far and capable of 30 -35 mile days (far beyond my limit) but he likes to get off in various towns, spend a few days and then speed on up the trail. As the saying goes “Hike your own hike”. Our paths had crossed since way back in Roan Mt TN on the 3 day section hike with my 14 year old Grandson, Carter. In any case, we hiked up and camped up at Spy rock, watched an amazing sunset, ate dinner together, sat around a campfire talking and planned a scramble up the rocky summit cone for sunrise at 6 am. 
About 5 am we awakened to the sound of laughing, loud talking and giggles walking past our tents. We both stuck our heads out to witness 7 or 8 local college students who hiked up a side trail from town in the dark to get yearbook pictures from the top of Spy rock at sunrise... legs and I looked at each other and silently nodded the sunrise scramble was “off” and went back to sleep with the laughter coming down to us from the top of the rock pile. 
Legs plan that next day was to hike to a road crossing that led back to Lexington where I’d just taken two days in and to visit a famous AT stop at the Devils Backbone Brewery where they will let AT hikers camp out on their lawn, they have a pub onsite for Breakfast, lunch and dinner foods and obviously sell a lot of their beer (which is very good and I’ve been tasting since I first saw it in NC). My plan now though was to get past the Brewery and hike towards Waynesboro which is the gateway city to the south end of the 103 mile hike through the National Park . Legs set off on his 30 mile per day speed hike (I haven’t seen him since) and I set off on mine, but am willing to bet our paths will cross again.
I had one more night before Waynesboro but two pretty big obstacles in the way, Three Ridges Mt and Humpback Mt that are infamous for steepness, rockiness and testing ones endurance. I also realized by noon the day was going to be hotter than any other so far (and later learned it hit 90 that day) and I tried a new AT hiking technique called “siesta” where I stopped about 1 pm, ate lunch, set up my tent for shade and took a 2 hour nap until it cooled down. I started back up at 4 pm after bathing in a cool stream where I also loaded up on water and then climbed one of the toughest and rockiest sections of the AT, Three ridges peak and set up my camp at the top of a cliff just below the summit as darkness was setting in. Also thunder clouds had formed during the hot humid afternoon and it was clear a summer downpour was coming during the night. 
I lit a campfire to chase away the black flies which are getting “thick” at this time of year and was startled when a large snake came wriggling out of the stone fire ring that looked like it hadn’t been used in a long time, (startled particularly since I was kneeling close to the fire to start it). I “urged” the snake away with a stick and within 15 minutes the skies opened up dousing my nice campfire and forcing me to cook dinner in the vestibule of my tent (kudos to Big Agnes tent company that made this feature easy in their tents!). 
It rained hard most of the night and I wondered how Legs was making out camped on the Brewery lawn but in the morning it cleared and began to dry out. Climbing out of my tent at dawn I saw another hiker had made the steep climb up at night and unheard by me during the night had set up their tent 100 feet from mine. I never saw them as I made breakfast and packed up my gear for a 7 am start, presumably still sound asleep. 
The next day was a long 23 mile day down off of Three ridges and across a broad valley to reclimb a substantial mountain called “Big Hump” which I’ve renamed “Dejavu” as it seemed to .... never end and seemed to have the same cliffs with fine views from a hundred different places along the trail.
On Big Hump I think for the first time on the trail I had some sense accomplishing this thru hike was a big deal when I met two women during my lunch break up on a cliff overlook who wanted to know all about the trail and they gave me several Hemp Protein bars to try and were enthusiastic about. 
The final 7 miles of the day wound down off the shoulder of Big Hump, along a stream and then climbed out over a ridge before leading down into Waynesboro at Rockfish Gap. (By the way, I asked several locals why this was called Rockfish gap and no one had any idea...).
I used Uber to get from the trail 4 miles into town and booked a room at a Quality Inn where I could shower, eat hot food I didn’t have to boil water for and resupply at a local Walmart. I also found (too late)  a list of twenty local hikers willing to be trail angels and give free rides too and from the downtown to the trail. I arranged a free ride the next day out to the trail up into Shenandoah National Park.","Lexington VA

Shenandoah National Park to Front Royal VA
The AT runs through two major National Parks in the US, Smoky Mountain National Park  and Shenandoah National Park. I’ve been in the Smokies several times on section hikes and drive through visits but had never been into SNP and had heard great things about it and the hiking conditions there so was looking forward to this section. 
I caught a ride out of Waynesboro to the trailhead with one of the local trail angels who provide free rides from town. There is a list of twenty people who are either former thru hikers or avid outdoorsmen who care enough to support the hiking community and worthy of a shout-out of thanks. 
The older gentleman “Jim” who gave me a ride was retired  from the railroad and a section hiker who wanted to know all about my hike to this point. He dropped me exactly where I got off the trail the previous day to make sure no steps on the AT were missed. 
I offered gas money for the ride which he refused and then  he gave me granola bars and apples from his stash in a beat up old pick-up truck that felt like it’s purpose in life was just to pick up and shuttle sweaty and dirty hikers like me. It was awesome! 
I headed up a gradual sloping path from the parking lot and headed into the park knowing there is a specific sign-in kiosk that needed to be stopped at as SNP requires registration of all visitors whether you drive or walk in. I reached the kiosk at about a half mile in and filled out the forms and was amused to see the requirement to fill out a paper form in triplicate (using carbon paper no less!) and then one copy of the registration paperwork was supposed to be “wired” to the outside of your pack with the threat of expulsion from the park if not visible!
 I laughed out loud at the bureaucratic stupidity that dreamed that idea up (certainly not a hiker!) without considering effects of rain, windy weather, and daily thru-hiker wear and tear ripping off the silly paperwork. I balled it up and crammed it into a zip pocket on my pack but with the required wire still “attached” .  I saw many hikers with their paperwork flailing from the back of their packs all week long like a kite and saw multiple shredded forms torn off and littering the beauty of the National Park. Yeah... Great idea...
In any case, the southern entry into the park lived up to its reputation as a beautiful and unique experience. The trail felt super manicured, soft under foot as if cushioned and designed as if by Disney World with gentle banking and a 
“Destination” for each switchback and outlook point along the way.  This is an extreme contrast to the rough Rocky trail through the rest of Virginia. 
My first night in the park I stealth camped about 18 miles from the trail head and needed to be mindful of the many regulations of where you are and aren’t allowed to camp. In any case, as is my preference I tented high on a ridge with a view and had to carry extra water up to the site but worth it for the experience. As I was preparing dinner I became aware of a herd of deer sneaking closer and closer to my tent. They apparently are so accustomed to humans they have no fear as hunting is prohibited in the National Park.  Eventually they were 15 - 20 feet from me and I was wondering if they wanted to share my instant mashed potatoes and pepperoni slices! 
SNP is also famous for its many eastern black bears and most AT hikers see bears in this section or have had food bags stolen (hey, hey, hey... look booboo, it’s a pick-a-nick basket!” ). To this point on the hike I’ve seen lots of signs of bears like tree scratches and droppings on the trail but not any live bears and am looking forward to sightings but not interested in losing my food supplies so I make sure my nightly bear bag hang is high and secure from any night time visitors. 
It’s become a daily sport almost with finding small baseball sized rocks, placing them inside of a small throwing  bag attached to 75 feet of thin orange (ok, at least it started the trip two months prior as orange, now a muddy grayish orange!) paracord and tossing it over the “perfect”
branch about 30 feet up in the air and not too close to the trunk so that a bear might climb and claw the food bag down. There’s also the trick of not getting your cord hopelessly wrapped around branches that might prevent you from retrieving the rope for another try and even more so when the food bag is attached as it could mean losing all your supplies. I always attach the food bag after I’ve made sure the ropes are clear and slide up and down easily but sometimes in the dark or windstorm you might be tempted to cut corners just to get it hung. Several times since the start in March, I’ve seen stranded bags or tangled bear lines up in trees abandoned. 
The Virginia weather has changed from spring to summer in a quick way and the heat and lack of rain is showing in the streams and springs we use daily to filter water from, making water management more of a issue than at the beginning and my body is requiring more water intake due to sweating. My destination the second night is a Shelter where a known reliable spring is located and I make the 19 miles easily by dark but along the way I was able to stop by a SNP unique feature known as a “Wayside “ which are rest areas scattered throughout the park for car visitors but in a several cases are near enough the AT to take a detour and for hikers to resupply at their store and to order simple foods like Cheeseburgers and milk shakes which is exactly what I do on this warm afternoon. I detoured off the trail a half mile each way but the hot food and thick cold milkshake made up for the time and calories expended. While definitely not gourmet, it fits the requirement of not needing to utilize boiled water as are the vast majority of my meals.
When I arrived at the shelter, there was a young couple set up in the shelter and already eating dinner but I planned to tent on some level ground out behind the shelter and near the spring. I set up camp and then went to the shelter to cook my dinner and meet the young couple, who it turned out were from Munich Germany and taking a months vacation in the US to hike a portion of the Virginia AT up to Harpers Ferry WV. While seemingly very fit, they were struggling with blisters and hiking aches and pains and had a lot of questions about distances and time to cover their planned hike. Also as often happens when a couple hike together, one is the stronger and faster hiker while the other gets guilt ridden about holding the other up and they were open about this dynamic of their trip. I looked at maps and trail guides with them trying to help but they ended up splitting up on the trail with the young woman “Ingrid” catching a shuttle ride each day to arrive at a trail head close to a shelter where her boyfriend would hike to and arrive by dark each night. I learned about this three days later when I caught up to her hiking alone near the northern end of the park and she explained the alternative plan to allow them both to finish. 
Since I had a quick overnight resupply and turn around back in Waynesboro, I had not been able to do a load of laundry and hiking in the daily heat causes profuse sweating, my clothes practically could stand up and walk by themselves so I made another detour the third day in the park to be able to camp at one of the National Park campgrounds where there would be showers and laundry facilities according to my AT guide. I made it a little shorter day of 15 miles and arrived in one of the smaller campgrounds that held maybe 30 car campsites. 
The check-in office was unmanned and a sign indicated to just occupy a site, fill out a form and drop money into a box, which I did, then walked a half mile up to the campstore where showers, food supply and laundry could be done. However, I was the proverbial “unhappy camper” though when I learned their laundry facilities were broken and not available that day. 
After camping in the wilderness for the previous two months, often completely alone in stealth sites, the camping experience shared with car campers and RV’s in close proximity is a jarring experience with radios blaring, kids yelling and a rather lack of privacy that I’ve grown used to. 
I stocked up on some camp store foods for dinner and a couple of cold beers after a much needed shower and returned to my site to chill out as the sun set. My neighbors on one side was a family with small children and on the other, four college age girls having a girls getaway. I actually got an invite over to their campsite to enjoy s’mores over a campfire they built. I warned them never invite a thru hiker for food unless you really mean it as we’re always hungry. I learned the four friends had just finished finals week and the girls getaway was a final goodbye as they were all graduating and going on to start jobs, grad school and one to the peace corps. They asked lots of questions about my adventure hiking the AT and after finding out I am retired from a consulting career, asked lots more questions about their professional futures. 
The next morning I set out at sunrise to make a long day and  a special destination to celebrate my birthday on the trail. At 20 miles was a National Park lodge called Skyland which is historic and set in a beautiful location at the top of a mountain and has a good restaurant and scenic view Pub overlooking a valley. My plan was to make it there for dinner then push on a couple more miles before dark and then tent at a stealth site. 
The trail which had been delightful and soft the previous three days coming into the park turned extremely rocky and steep on the climb up to the mountain top where Skyland is located, slowing me down some from my original plan so when I arrived I checked if they had any small cabins a thru hiker could rent at the last minute and was in luck. I checked into a one room log cabin circa 1930 and showered again (what? Twice in two days? Unheard of!) and then walked up to the restaurant by way of the Pub. 
I had noticed previously that since before Waynesboro when Legs and I split up I hadn’t seen any of the other thru hikers I’d been crossing paths with, making it a little lonely and assumed my birthday was going to be a solo dinner at the pub. However as I walked onto the pubs patio I saw a good AT hiking buddy “RTK” (Return to Katahdin) sitting with a friend who is section hiking with him.  I joined in a beer and subtly mentioned it was my birthday whereupon they both invited me to dinner and a couple of bottles of Virginia wine (pretty good actually) and they picked up the tab. Now that’s trail magic! 
The next day after a large hikers breakfast at the lodge I headed out and along the final ridge line of the Shenandoah’s with a destination of Front Royal VA which marks the Northern end of the National Park. I crossed several fine open cliffs with nice outlooks to the west and I had one more mountain to climb and descend when I finally saw my first bears on this hike. 
The trail steeply climbed a rocky slope and I saw from my GPS a stream crossing where I planned to refill water bottles as it again was hot and humid. As I hiked the trail over the stream-bed I saw movement out of the corner of my eye just 30 feet downstream from me and saw two adolescent black bears probably from last years litter.  I estimate they were 100-125 lbs and not a 300 full grown beat. They were playing in the stream, rolling over rocks probably looking for food and as I noticed them, they became aware of me and stood up on hind legs to look right at me eye to eye. What I didn’t see and instantly got very worried about was that I didn’t see “Mama bear” which as every hiker knows you should never get between mama and her cubs. I glanced up the steep rocky stream-bed above me and didn’t see anything threatening but imagined a full grown ticked off bear coming barreling down this stream at me and couldn’t chance stopping to refill my water bottles in such a dangerous situation. I pushed on without water and had to wait for another spring in 2 miles. 
As I left the National Park borders and headed towards Front Royal I had another strange encounter as I had to step aside to let two horse riders pass me riding up the steep and narrow AT. Horses, motorcycles and mountain bikes are not allowed on the AT due to trail damage and erosion they cause but these two women were convinced they were on the right path and rightfully there, nor did they stop long enough to discuss it. The trail was so narrow at this point and steep I have no idea how they could have turned the horses around anyways. 
At the Front Royal road crossing, there is a very nice hiker hostel at a renovated farm called “Mountain Home cabin” and I stayed with 3 other hikers in a small brick house on the property. The hostel is run by a former thru hiker and his wife. He was hiking southbound in 2011 and found the rundown and abandoned farm near the Appalachian trail and stopped in long enough to investigate and make an offer to buy the property. It’s been an ongoing project but the resulting inn and hostel are beautiful. This hostel also does laundry and after two weeks of wearing the same sweaty clothes it feels so good to get them cleaned and a shower!

As the first half of my AT thru hike winds down, I found myself both anxious to “get it done” and sad that it was winding up so quickly. The midpoint destination of Harpers Ferry WV is both historically and logistically a good breaking point. The Appalachian Trail Committee which is responsible for planning, representing and maintaining the 2190 miles of trail, makes it’s headquarters there and they have a sign in and photo process that documents your passing thru as well as handing out free drinks and snacks to hikers. Harpers Ferry is also close to Washington DC making transportation and sightseeing of the nations Capitol possible. 
After a large included breakfast at the Front Royal hostel I headed off to finish out the last major section before my half way point. The first days hike started easy with a gradual sloping 5 miles up into a Mt VA state park. Along the way were large fenced in areas of grass and woods that the trail passed beside. I thought the landowners must have something against AT hikers as at points the fences were on both sides of the trail and posted “No trespassing “ It turns out the Federal government owns many thousands of acres  of Virginia farmland and forests that have been used over the years for things as diverse as raising and training horses for the US army in WWI when that’s actually how armies moved about in battle, the Smithsonian zoo breeds and raises animals here and the TSA dogs are bred and trained in facilities here... Who knew? The AT hikers joke that it’s also really Jurassic Park as some fences are 16 feet tall! Creepy! 
I stopped for lunch and a break at what is widely regarded as the nicest shelter on the AT, the Jim and Molly Stanton Shelter has a wide wrap around deck with chairs, a covered picnic pavilion with tables, horseshoe pits, a solar shower and unbelievably, toilet paper in its outhouse! This last amenity is missing from every other “privy” on the AT and someone cleans and resupplies this one so kudos to the Stanton’s whoever you may be!
I hiked on that afternoon thru the state park as it got very hot and humid and thunderstorms began to build on the horizon. I had pushed on pretty hard that afternoon anxious to get closer to Harpers Ferry but hadn’t paid much attention to my water intake and resupply. I need to fire my water manager! By 6 pm I was dehydrated, tired and sure to get caught in the thunderstorm when I came to a road crossing. There, just out of sight of the road was a large red cooler full of warm gatorades and bottled waters. Of course they would have been better cold but I literally dropped my pack and sat on the ground in the middle of the trail like a child and sucked down two of those Gatorades non-stop. Heavenly! I was rehydrated and still had 4 miles to make a Shelter rather than setting up my tent in the storm. Darkness was falling so I pulled out my head lamp and prepared for a night hike while lightning started to flick across the sky. I hiked faster trying to outrun the storm when I heard a thrashing in the brush right at my feet and glanced down with the headlight to see a 3 foot rattle snake about a foot away from me (much too close for comfort) and apparently I’d been moving so fast he’d not had a chance to coil and rattle to warn me. In any case, I planted my trekking poles and launched myself pole vaulter style to clear the snake and just kept on going. I was reminded of the Indiana Jones line from the Raiders of the lost ark movie “why’s it always have to be snakes?!?” 
In about 100 yards after this encounter, I unbelievably came across a dayhiker (now a night hiker I suppose) finishing up a long day but without a flashlight or head lamp and he wanted to know how much further in the dark? I told him 3 miles but watch out for the rattlers! His face went absolutely dead white in the gleam of my headlight and I do wish I had a second light to give to him but I didn’t so just wished him luck.
I made the Shelter about 9 in the total dark with the rain coming down hard. I was surprised to see I was the only hiker there that night and took note of the bear warning signs posted as I made my dinner and hung my food bag in a tree. About 10:30 after climbing into bed I saw a light coming through the woods as another AT hiker “mongo” came in soaking wet. He hadn’t seen the snake but said they often hunt at night and can be found on trails, walk ways and driveways in the south.... now I know! 
The next day started the infamous “Virginia Rollercoaster ” which is a 13 mile stretch of tightly packed in steep ups and downs on rocky loose terrain. The trail crew here is proud of how difficult it is and post signs taunting the hikers at either end with “Enjoy your ride- The trail boss”! It was a grinding trail and another hot day on top of dirty dusty conditions. Near the end of the Roller Coaster also signifies a major milestone which is leaving VA after 500 plus miles and entering WV which is the fifth state the AT passes through. 
What a long and varied state it has been taking approximately 30 days to hike and spanning from snowy freezing conditions in the south to hot 90 degree days and summer time thunderstorms in the North. From rocky steep trails to soft pine woods, Virginia has run the full gamut of conditions. 
As a matter of fact, I did enjoy the ride and crushed that Roller Coaster and I enjoyed it! I finished the day in the rain and again had a choice of setting up a wet camp in a stealth spot or pushing myself a little longer and harder to make a bunkhouse maintained by the local AT club. I night hiked again by headlight but this time it was eerie being on top of a mountain with drifting clouds and warm rain coming down making for low visibility. The bunkhouse is down a steep 1/4 mile side-trail and as I turned onto it, again found a rattlesnake coiled by the side of the trail but this time warning me with its rattles. Trust me I walked carefully the rest of the way after two snakes in two nights! 
I let myself into the bunkhouse where there was one other hiker already in bed and had built a fire in a wood stove to dry off their gear so I cooked my late dinner outside on the porch before turning in. The bunkhouse was small and sparse with just 4 beds. I quietly spread out my wet and by now smelly clothes to dry in the dark. In the morning I got up and hopped out of bed in my “skivvies” to get dressed and was surprised to hear a women’s voice from the other bunk “Good Morning!” Yikes, I had assumed it was a male thru hiker asleep but got a real surprise that morning. It turns out she was starting a flip flop from Harpers Ferry south to GA before doing Harpers Ferry north to ME later this year. It had taken her 3 days to cover what I was about to do the next day into Harpers Ferry and it appeared she was overweight, over packed and out of shape but still kudos to her for trying this at all! 
I finished my first half AT  hike with a long ridge line walk crossing several times back and forth between VA and WV before descending steeply down into Harpers Ferry where  the trail crosses the Potomac river. The trail was muddy and full of flowing water from the previous days rains. 
There is a saying there is “100 falls on the AT” and I hadn’t had a single fall in 2 and a half months thru snowstorms, rain, mud, ice, night hiking, rocky trails etc but I had my first fall that day walking down into Harpers Ferry sliding down a steep 15 foot muddy wet rock face when both feet went flying out from underneath me and I landed on my pack and bent one of my trekking poles so badly it needed to get thrown away. I slowly picked myself up and checked for broken bones and decided only my pride was hurt. My backpack took the brunt of the fall and was dragged through the mud but survived the day. 
I hiked into town and up to the ATC headquarters where they check in halfway hikers and take photos for a yearbook. I was starting hiker # 519 back in March at Springer Mt but I was hiker # 189 to make it halfway!
Pretty good for an old guy carrying the world on his shoulders... Atlas
I checked into a local motel and started the process of scrubbing off layers of dirt and smell before catching a ride the next day to Dulles airport to fly to Atlanta to meet my wife Kim. I also threw away most of my clothes and socks and various pieces of gear that were worn out, broken or not needed anymore. Kim sent a care package with new clothes (all small!) a pair of size 12 sandals for my now monster sized feet. 
I was thrilled to finish the first half but also anxious to get home to home and family and not sleeping on the ground. I stepped on a scale and had lost 20 pounds in 2 and 1/2 months which Kim started immediately trying to put back on me before I leave in mid-July to start the second half of this adventure. 
I plan to restart the southbound half of the trip in mid -July starting in Maine and ending back in Harpers Ferry sometime in Mid October.","Front Royal VA

It seems impossible that my two month break before restarting the AT is over all ready. I needed the break and loved all the family time with our kids and grandkids but mostly my time with my best friend and wife, Kim. She has been supportive of pursuing this dream, worried when appropriate, nursing me back to “hiking weight “ and making sure I got lots of high quality foods over the summer. 
For the restart of the trek, my son-in-law agreed to drive me up from Boston and hike a couple of days with me and to summit the northern terminus of the Appalachian trail, Mt Katahdin. While living in New England and attending University of Maine I climbed Katahdin 7 previous times (but was much younger then) and looked forward to returning. 
We drove 7 hours north and camped in Baxter Park at Katahdin stream campsites which is rustic and located right where the AT crosses and climbs steeply up to the rocky summit. We decided on the first day to take a 7 mile warmup hike to Blueberry ledges before cooking dinner over a fire by the stream. It was great. 
We woke at first light to eat a quick breakfast before hitting the trail which is 5.2 miles each way to the top and back. Then because we weren’t able to get a second night in Baxter Park, I would continue on a 10 mile leg of the AT south to a commercial campground at Abol Bridge, just outside of the BSP boundary. The only problem with this is it meant a 20 plus mile day for my first day back on the trail and a little out of hiking shape but unavoidable due to logistics.
We started at 5:30 am as the day would be long and the climb extremely strenuous. We made good time up the AT with stops at Katahdin waterfalls and at the point where the trail breaks above tree line. On most mountains this is somewhat gradual and the trail eases into the open rocky terrain but on Katahdin, you climb steeply up and out of the woods to a giant boulder field and cliffs above you. The trail then becomes technical climbing with lots of hand over hand and seeking foot and hand holds in the granite. Several sections have metal rebar ladders and hand holds drilled into the rock as you make your way towards the top. A typical hiking pace is between 2 and 3 miles per hour whereas this route forces you to less than 1 mile per hour. Many places have significant drop offs and loose rock to beware of. The trail is truly treacherous and has claimed lives over the years. 
We climbed up from a nice morning down below into swirling mountain-created clouds not far above tree line. We felt a cold drizzle as we made our way a mile across the Alpine lawn terrain of the tablelands and when we reached the rocky cone summit of Katahdin for the final push, visibility dropped to a few feet. We joined maybe 10 other climbers on top, many of whom had just completed their Northbound 2100 mile journey and to see the emotions and shouts of joy as they touched the historic “North Terminus “ sign and posed for victory photos was amazing for me and Bill. 
It started to pour as we sat down for second breakfast on the top and needed to head back down... that steep slippery rock face we had just climbed up with difficulty. It took a long time to do it safely but we eventually made the return in about 9 hours for 10 miles. I reloaded my daypack and headed into the woods southbound with the arrangements that Bill would drive the car out of the park and around to Abol bridge where we’d meet for dinner. 
Walking into the woods alone brought the adventure back to life as I began the second half of my adventure. The trail was soft and relatively flat compared to the first “half” of my day. The AT followed old logging roads around lakes and along streams through the park but the rain decided to follow me down from the peak making it a muddy and buggy 10 mile walk out of Baxter State Park. Bill and I met at the campground and set up tents next to a lake and crashed early. My legs were beat, bruised and bloody after the first day back. I loved it! 
The next morning Bill joined me for the first 3 mile segment of the trail before heading back to drive back to Boston. From Abol Bridge the AT enters the infamous Hundred Mile Wilderness in Maine which happens to be the remotest section of the AT. No towns, no paved road crossings, no stores, no easy rescue. There is a sign telling hikers to prepare for 10 days of food just in case. I’m only carrying 6 and counting on making the next southbound town, Monson ME with rations to spare but it is an unknown as I’ve never hiked this Wilderness before, have no idea how difficult or easy it will be, whether it will rain or be hot. Whatever it will be, will be excellent! 
I continue on only 12 miles on this first day to compensate for the beating I put on my legs and feet the previous day. I camp at a beautiful spot on Rainbow lake with a spring bubbling fresh water from a hillside into the lake. The water is clear and warm so I swim for a few minutes until I see this lake has leeches living in it and I get out before any attach to me. I’ve come up with a new Tourist slogan for Maine “ we’re out for your blood “ with pictures of mosquitoes, ticks, leeches and mountains ! 
The next day dawns heavy with humidity and you can feel rain is imminent. I pack quickly and head further south into the wilderness. I meet two first time southbounders that had started 4 days earlier and still “learning the ropes”. They asked what to do about hiking in the rain and in particular thunder and lightning storms. I told them “Just keep moving!” And I asked them if they had trail names yet. Nope, not yet they replied so I named them Thunder and Lightning on the spot. Good luck guys! 
I make 17 mikes on this third day almost all in rainy muddy conditions through swamps and crossing streams with no bridges. By dark I’m beat and making mistakes like placing my feet on tree roots which are really slippery when wet. I set up tent in the rain, cook dinner in the vestibule and fall asleep by 8 pm. 
After a hard rain all night, the tent walls and floor are damp, all socks and clothes are muddy and wringing wet. I make a decision over breakfast to take a short day and stop at a north woods hunting camp called White House Landing that also takes in AT hikers but it requires a boat ride across a lake to get there. I check in and explode my pack in the cabin turning every thing into a drying clothesline. By mid afternoon I’m dried out, rested and ready for dinner and a early start tomorrow. 
On with the adventure!","My Katahdin

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598163,"Hundred Mile Wilderness to Monson, Me
After trekking 1025 miles Northbound from Georgia to Harpers Ferry WV, I thought I had a good handle on the long distance hiking “thing”. Years of experience in backpacking throughout New England in all seasons and multiple climbs of Mt Katahdin all led me to believe this would be a “sure bet”. The reality is, the One Hundred Mile wilderness is really rugged hiking, beautiful in in a wild way, sometimes dangerous and a true test to get through. But before I go on with the narrative I want to readdress the “one hundred falls” thing that I explained in the last segment of my Northbound hike where I fell hard going into Harpers Ferry. 
Hiking the AT in general is a pretty straight forward thing with a one to two foot wide dirt path that extends 2190 miles from Georgia to Maine. Sounds simple, safe and somewhat boring. But the catch is in the terrain, steepness, weather conditions and degree of fatigue that you happen to be feeling at the time. For example, My first fall was down a slippery muddy cliff and at the end of a long day trying to “finish “ the halfway goal in Harpers Ferry. I was miffed at myself for sloppiness and lack of focus as I had gone up and down hundreds of similar steep slopes in the previous 2 months and was cocky that I was better than the average hikers who experience the infamous “hundred falls”. After-all this was one in 1025 miles. 
Then I restart with an aggressive climb of Mt Katahdin and a walk through the unknown Hundred Mile Wilderness and now must report a further FOUR hard falls in the first week back on the trail. The terrain here in Maine is rugged, rocky and covered with slippery tree roots. Even though it’s been dry for the past month, there are muddy sections almost every mile even at high elevations. Once your feet get wet and muddy they become slick on rocks and roots. In addition the trail crosses rivers and streams every few miles mostly without bridges or easy rocks to jump across. Balance and dexterity are hiking traits that I’ve prided myself on and yet now I feel clumsy and off balance in many situations. To say the HMW is humbling and playing field leveling is an understatement. 
To continue with my narrative though, the decision to stop and dry out at White House Landing was a smart one and created good memories. The husband and wife owners Bill and Linda are nice, their “off the grid” property is beautiful, rustic and relaxing to be at and the food excellent and incorporates their fresh garden produce as often as possible. Most importantly though they have Labradors to play with. I succeeded in drying out all my gear, resting from a couple of muddy slippery days and left the following morning feeling eager and energized. This northern section of the AT is relatively flat, winding around lakes and ponds and over smaller hills and one or two mountains. 
I hiked 17 miles that first day back to make up for a shorter but much need day off the previous. I ended up tenting near Copper Brook Falls that night which has a Shelter looking directly onto a nice set of waterfalls and pools from a mountain river. My tent site, while far from flat and spacious was located close to the stream itself. I’ve hiked almost half way through the wilderness by day 4 and while the trail has had lots of roots and rocks it’s been manageable. I can see on my topographic map though the terrain is about to get tougher ahead. I decide to start extra early into the more mountainous area so fall asleep by 8 pm and rise the next morning with first light and set out on the trail at 6 am. 
Now the terrain becomes steep and contains multiple peaks and valleys. In one 15 mile stretch, I climb up and over two steep mountains with very rocky trails and barely making 2 miles per hour. The weather has become hot and humid causing profuse sweating and a much higher water intake required. The highest peak in the HMW is above tree line Whitecap Mt and proves to be a long and tiring climb but rewarded me with a clear view back to Mt Katahdin 35 air miles away and yet a full 65 Miles by trail. I end up at a tent site that night just before dark after picking my way down very steep rocky stairs. When I arrive though all 8 flat tent spots are full of Northbound hikers pushing on to finish their AT hike so I along with two other late arriving south-bounders set upon a flat section of the trail itself and cook dinner in the dark before collapsing into bed. 
The next morning I again rise at first light knowing the trail gets tougher still with the next two days. By mid morning The trail runs deep into a valley where my first river fording takes place. In several places in Maine, you have to take off shoes and socks and wade thigh deep through a rushing river. I wear my rubber camp shoes to protect my feet from the rocky slippery bottom of the riverbed. The trekking poles help to keep balance and steady against the current. 
After drying off and getting my hiking boots on again I struggle up steep Chairback mountain with its multiple (4) peaks and at one point find myself climbing hand over hand up a steep rock slide with boulders jumbled the size of a kitchen table turned all sorts of crazy upside down. This terrain is of the same geological strata and difficultly as Katahdin which was really tough but this time I have a 25 lb backpack pulling me off balance and gravity trying to pull me down the 100 yard high climb without a belay rope. I realize a single slip, a mis-step, a mistake could cost me my life if not a horrific trip-ending injury with unimaginable rescue and extraction difficulties.
My plan had been an aggressive 16 miles that day but at 11 I was exhausted and struggled to stay hydrated. I decide the next Shelter is a reasonable target and try to make it by 5 pm. The Chairback Mt Shelter is poised literally on the side of a cliff and the water source is a small spring at the bottom of the cliff. I climb down only to find mud puddles rather than a flowing bubbling spring. Bummer!  I resolve to filter and boil the muddy water given it has the color and smell of tea. I know 3 miles ahead the next day is a flowing stream and reliable so will minimize my water intake now and guzzle when I hike the next day. 
The heat and humidity has been building again and the sense of rain falling is imminent . I rise early, pack quickly and head out. Upon climbing Columbus Mt and descending again I find the promised stream and filter and drink a full liter at one sitting as well as bottle 2 liters for the day. The trail gets more and more rugged following ledges and climbing and descending steep slopes but then the rain starts in earnest by noon making the trail slippery and slowing down  progress to about 1 mile per hour. I slip and fall hard twice on slick ledge only too aware of the precipice below me. In good weather it would be a challenging hike, in rainy windy conditions it is treacherous. 
I intend to push as long and hard as I can this day as the next will bring me out to Monson ME which is the southern terminus of the HMW.   I push until about 15 miles to go and have several river crossings to go before I will look for a flat stealth tenting site. My legs are tired and I feel punch drunk from jarring from rock to rock when I try a major river crossing on wet rocks and  totally lose my balance ending up knee deep with both hiking boots in the rushing water. It was too slippery to try to climb back out and I was soaked anyways so trudged across the rest of the river in the pouring rain. 
I should explain here to non-hiking readers that when temperatures are cold or very windy, I’d be wearing a hooded rain parka, rain paints or both but when it’s warm out and you are exerting yourself strenuously like these AT hikes are, you just put a rain cover on your pack and a hat on your head and just walk through it. You’ll dry eventually and thru-hikers like to say “It’s a beautiful day to take a shower and do laundry at the same time!” You can tell section or day hikers in the rain all wrapped up in Goretex and through hikers by the smiles on their wet faces. 
After falling in, I walk another two miles before finding a great spot for my tent near a waterfall and set up in the rain quickly, make dinner in the tent and crash out from exhaustion knowing the next day is a very doable 13 mile walk out to Monson and I’ve called ahead for a reservation at a famous hikers hostel Shaw’s. 
I wake in the morning to water flowing under the tent from the downpours overnight and so everything is packed up wet and probably adding 10 lbs to my pack weight. I head down the trail knowing that the difficulty is not over and I need to push myself to get out of this last section. I had planned 6 nights of food and had already been out 7 nights and now with soaked equipment did not intend to stay another night in the wilderness. I started to cross multiple steep ridges at the top of each was exposed slate ledges that the trail runs along for several hundred yards before dropping into a gully and climbing steeply out again.  The slate was extremely slippery underfoot for my soaked muddy boots and twice find my feet going completely out from under me landing on my butt, my pack, my elbows and wrists. Once I laid there in the rain on my back trying to triage whether or not I had broken bones but determined to be just deeply bruised. 
I pushed on slower and slower almost fearful as my confidence in my balance and dexterity were shaken. I can’t help thinking “you’re walking like an old man!” 
At 5:30 I reach the southern trail head where the same warning sign is as exists at the Northern entrance, “ The next 100 miles are remote, rugged and dangerous...” Amen brother! I snap a selfie which in contrast to my entrance smiling photo is dirt and sweat streaked, squinting and with 8 days of scratchy beard scruff but the eyes tell the above story without any words.","White House Landing

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600391,"Monson to Caratunk ME
After the Hundred Mile wilderness the first southbound civilization is the small town of Monson ME located about 4 miles off the AT. It has two small stores, two small restaurants(closed on Mondays!) one gas station, two Hiker hostels and not much else... well you get the idea. I take a zero day (no hiking) at Shaw’s hostel which is one of the most popular hostels on the AT. I clean, dry and repair equipment and buy resupply food for the next section of the trail southbound and rest up as best possible. I also tank up on calories as much as possible on unlimited blueberry pancakes, cooked to order eggs and bacon. I feel my weight starting to drop after only a week from the daily hiking and intense sweating that through hikers experience. 
The following morning I’m packed and ready to go on the first shuttle up to the trail head and plan to hike a 17 mile day up to a campsite on a lake. Humidity and low clouds are not ideal for hiking but if AT hikers wait for good weather they’d never complete the trail. 
I cross three rivers during the day requiring boots off wading again but on one crossing the hiker 20 feet behind me gets two leeches attached to him, one on an ankle and the other awkwardly between his big toe. They latch on tight and can be burned off with a lighter or scraped off with a knife which is what he chooses rather than burning himself between the toes. I’m lucky so far and haven’t been attacked. 
I reach the pond campsite around 6 pm in a light drizzle but with the sense it’s about to pour so quickly set up my tent and resupply water from the pond to cook dinner and breakfast with. This pond is known to have Moose in it and I really want to see a Moose in Maine. I was surprised not to have seen any in Baxter Park and Mt Katahdin but one local hiker said it was typical in the summer for them to go deep into the woods to avoid the summer tourist hikers and campers and then become more visible in the fall and early spring. However at the pond I don’t see a Moose but can hear a crashing through the woods about a quarter mile from me in the thick underbrush. Moose are very large weighing hundreds of pounds and eight feet high at the Antlers and walking through the Woods is like a Safari Jeep in that they just bulldoze through. I walk towards the sound but with the rain getting heavier and the Moose moving further away as I attempt to get closer I give up at dusk and climb into the tent for a damp nights sleep. 
The next day is another 17 miles up and over two mountains, Moxie Bald and Pleasant Pond Mt before heading into the small town of Caratunk Me the following day. 
As I climb Moxie with two other hikers (Adele and Lil Red) we climb up into the clouds and onto exposed rock ledges. Again the geology of this area is more slick slate rock than the coarse granite typical of New England. At the top of Moxie we can barely see each other, never mind seeing any of the great views this mountain range is known for. On top we find that the AT is poorly marked above tree line and hard to follow. We split up to explore the multiple paths that potentially are the AT while calling out to each other in the clouds until we locate the steep and slippery way off the peak. In the valley between the two mountains there is a Shelter where we take a mid afternoon lunch break while a heavy rain falls. Adele and Lil Red opt to call it a day and stay at the shelter to dry out while I push on the next seven miles over Pleasant Pond Mt and down to its namesake Pleasant Pond where I’ll camp for the night before walking the six miles into Caratunk where I have a reservation at a B and B hiker hostel. On top of the second mountain another hiker “Sliced Beets” who I met in the HMW catches up to me and we pick our way up and over the muddy and slippery mountain. It’s a steep descent over ledges and boulders and dark is setting in. I made it to the campsite about 10 minutes before Beets and he stumbles into camp with Blood on his face and the news that he fell hard coming down the mountain and struck a rock with his head and may have blacked out but isn’t really sure. He seems very dazed and hurt and wants to lay down in the rain to sleep which is a clear sign of concussion and a little alarming. We get the tents up, cook dinner in the dark and plan to walk out slowly the next morning to see if he needs medical attention when we get to Caratunk. 
The next day is only a relatively flat six miles out to Caratunk (called a Nero... a near zero) but through exceptionally muddy areas often on wooden plank bridges built recently to cross over the swampy areas. In the rain and mud, wet boots are like greased ice skates on the boards and I fall twice into the mud hitting legs and butt on the planks. Beets who is walking slowly behind me luckily doesn’t fall at all but observes where the slippery areas are from my spectacular wipe outs. 
When we arrive at the Caratunk House B and B, the owner Paul  (a former thru hiker and really nice guy) checks us in and is immediately concerned about Beets fall the previous night and bloodied face and recommends seeing a doctor ASAP but the nearest is 37 miles away in Skowhegan ME and he offers to drive Beets there himself. They are gone late into the night and I learn the next day a MRI revealed a concussion (Hikers call it “Ringing the Bell”) and doctors recommend 5 days off-trail. 
It turns out to be the discouraging reason for Sliced Beets to go back home to VA, calling off the rest of the trek as some of the steepest and rockiest sections of the AT in Maine still are coming up and his confidence is understandably shaken. 
Caratunk is a small town of 60 people but is famous for its White Water rafting and the fact that the AT crosses the 100 yard wide Kennebec River here by canoe. In the “old days”, AT hikers found a specific spot on the river and waded chest deep holding the backpack overhead and it was a “Rite of Passage” to make this deep Ford crossing safely. Over the years though there were drownings and lost packs and the river itself changed with current and Hydroelectric dam releases a couple of times a day. In recent years the ATC provides a free canoe ferry ride from 9 am till 2 pm every day across the river and strongly discourages trying it “the traditional way” as some still try it ever year. 
In any case I’m first at the ferry spot before 9 am and help the ferryman put the canoe in the River, sign release forms (yikes, lawyers on the AT... now that’s a scarier thought than bears, falls and leeches!) and paddle across to start the next section towards the south.","Monson ME

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600398,"Caratunk to Sugarloaf Mt Me
After crossing the Kennebec I enter a flat and muddy section of the trail leading towards the start of the high peaks in central and southern Maine but more importantly is a planned reunion with my wife Kim who’s planning to drive from Boston to Sugarloaf Mt where we’ll stay and I’ll zero so we can catch up on our various busy adventures we are living. 
I set out across the lakes area and my destination for the day is called West Carry Pond which seems unusual but I read on a historical plague that the trail follows the trail of Benedict Arnold’s sneak attack on Quebec City by leading his army through the Maine woods by canoe and boat from lakes and rivers up from the sea into Canada. The “carry” refers to having to portage/carry the boats and supplies overland until the next water to launch the boats into. 
In any case, the day was a relatively flat 15 muddy miles with a memorable meeting in the middle with one of my Northbound friends (CraftE) from  the first half of the trek. It’s worth noting here that since day four in the HMW I’ve met almost all my tramily (trail family) members from Georgia on up to Harpers Ferry. Hunny and Moon (the newlyweds), Shark-bait (surfer from CA), Traveller (from NZ), Ridge (whom I renamed IHOP in VA after eating 12 pancakes and 6 eggs at trail magic), Eddie and Cat (a famous saxophonist from NY), Knee deep (from our Smokey Mts snow hike in March, Pitboss, Detail (who started the same day as I in March and lives near where we used to in Boston ), Maverick, RTK (who bought me birthday dinner in May in the Shenandoah National Park) Two-fer (named for a second through hike and started same day asI did) and many others. In most cases, the meetings were brief and on the trail, usually with fist bumps (hikers are Niro-virus wary!) and back slapping but always with the need to get back on the trail, got to push the miles, got to keep moving...
I spent a rainy night in the tent after meeting a Dutch couple at the shelter who every year come to the US and section hike a portion of the AT. Our paths crossed over the next few days and compared notes about life in the US vs Europe, hiking styles, gear, food, etc. 
The next day I was ready to get up and out of this mud and into the Bigelow Mt range where the peaks rise above 3500 feet and are rugged, rocky and above tree line mountains. With good weather (ha! What’s that?) they have spectacular views across the valley at Sugarloaf Mt, the largest and highest Ski resort in Maine and one which our family used to spend ski vacations at creating great memories. 
While on the trail southbound that day I crossed with the Crawford family (usually just referred to on the AT as “the family “) who are 6 children ranging in age from 2 to 17 and two parents hiking the AT this year.! They were always one or two days behind me in the south and I never met them but it blew my mind they were staying up with my 18 and 20 mile days but everyone on the trail was talking about them. They took refuge in the restrooms at Newfound Gap in the Smokies in the three day snow storm resulting in a infamous police and family service intervention) In any case, they were moving fast Northbound when I saw them that day with the six and seven year olds leading the way briskly and the two year old in a carry backpack. I have to admit some concern and question the safety of this endeavor given how rough the terrain has been so far in Maine, my multiple falls, rock climbs, etc. We didn’t talk other than the usual hiker salutations “happy trails” as I stepped aside to let the parade through. I did notice that only the dad was talking (non-stop I might add) and the kids faces were resolute, determined and grimy. 
I tented that night at Little Bigelow mountain shelter which is situated above some waterfalls and deep pools called “the tubs” which I made great use of to wash off the caked on mud on my body, boots and gear and finally we had a dry, cool day perfect for drying out my equipment. 
The next day I wake with the dawn at 5am, pack quickly and prepare to climb the two high peaks of Bigelow as well as the lesser peak of little Bigelow. The trail is almost all on steep slanted granite but it’s the rough, non slippery type of rock that climbers like and the dry air and brisk breezes overnight have evaporated the previous weeks rain. 
As hoped, a clear day above tree line features the great views in all directions and I stop at several places for snacks and lunches (hikers are always hungry so we often eat two or more breakfasts and lunches! Don’t Judge us! We’re just hungry and fading away!). In particular after climbing the North peak and headed down into the deep col between the two peaks the trail disappears into a 300 yard tall jumble of boulders and rock scree. The trail is irrelevant because the stones shift and it’s every man for themselves to get up or down. It takes a while and I note it would be safer and easier to climb up this pitch than down it with out a rope. My mantra is always “be safe but keep moving” when climbing. It gets you over and off the tough spots on the trail and there are a lot of them here in Maine. 
I tent at the south end of the Bigelow range at Horn Pond after only a ten mile but very strenuous day. I also meet a southbound hiker named Tri-star (no idea why...) and his short legged terrier (Trixie?) who I observed scramble up and down extremely steep sections of the trail. I asked Tri-star if he ever had to help the dog over any difficult parts and he said he’d never picked him up once since starting at Katahdin! 
My tent site looks across the valley at Sugarloaf and after dinner I make a cup of tea and look over there thinking about the next day when I would see my wife, get some real food and sleep in a real bed. I knew it was an relatively easy 8 miles out to the trail head parking lot where we’d meet at 3 pm so I planned accordingly. 
The next day I anxiously arrived at the trail head early, tried to clean up as best as possible without water and waited. I was so glad to see Kim pull in after her five hour drive up from Boston and after some hugs and kisses (she MAY have said something sweet like “ugggh, you smell!”) we checked into a B and B called Hostel of Maine (abbreviated it’s H.O.ME ... cute, no?), showered, changed into presentable town clothes and got a massive steak dinner and a good bottle of red wine! Time for a good nights sleep!","Caratunk Me
",Sugarloaf Me,"Jul 28, Sat",75

As planned, I took a zero day of rest with my wife at Sugarloaf and we did some exploring in the local area including driving to find a historic wire bridge that Kim had read about. It dates back to the 1800’s and is wooden planks suspended by wires from bank to bank over a river. Since it’s suspended, it moves side to side as well as undulates (ripples) when you drive over it. We took pictures (Kim’s a great photographer), explored the river and drove over the bridge multiple times to get the “feel” of the swinging and swaying (did I mention it was built in the 1800’s!!! Yikes!). We also went to the AT trailhead and handed  out trail magic snacks and cold drinks to AT hikers. Now, part of the deal with the visit was I had to lose the wire brush beard so hikers didn’t recognize the clean shaven and washed me from the smelly, grubby hiker trash that I was the day before! We had lots of laughs, naps and a huge dinner in town at a “Farm to table” restaurant featuring local products. Awesome. But the wine came from California, not ready yet for “Kennebec Cabernet” or “Caratunk Chablis”....
The next morning I re-packed my pack and traded in my town clothes for the worn but clean hiking shorts and quick dry shirt that I live in. Kim dropped me off at the trail head and after hugs and kisses I headed into the mountains and steeply up the first of several peaks of the Crocker range. I intended to cross three mountains that day including the backside of Sugarloaf but found that after two peaks and steep descents of rock slides (much steeper than a staircase) I was “done” and set up tent at the Crocker campsite which has three streams flowing thru it and my tent was 10 feet from a bubbling brook. I also was pestered by aggressive chipmunks who thought I was invading their territory. I had to chase them out of my pack, off of my shoes, poking under the rain fly to inspect my tent. Eventually I got a small pile of rocks and rather than getting up each time, just winged a stone at them which resulted in a chattering scolding each time. 
The next morning I climbed up and over Sugarloaf and the afternoon turned cloudy and drizzly as I approached the North end of the Saddleback range. I met a Ridge runner on the trail during the day (a volunteer ATC role that rove the trail to answer questions, encourage good behavior and safety) who warned me of flash flood conditions coming overnight and to make sure I made the river crossing 3 mikes before Poplar Ridge campsites or it would be impossible to cross the next day. I crossed the river hopping rock to rock and set up tent as it began to downpour. I cooked dinner in the vestibule of my tent again thankful for the Big Agnes 2 person tent I carry vs just a rain tarp or little 1 person coffin tents that are popular now for “ultralight” hikers. 
Packing up in the rain is never fun but I made do at first light knowing I had a long and difficult day ahead. Saddleback mountain is a range of peaks that like a saddle contain a horn and front and a back peak and the “seat” in the middle. Altogether it’s about 3 miles of above tree line exposed rock and steep rocky ascents and descents. On a dry day they would be fun but challenging. On this particular day the trail became a roaring river and the steep sections became waterfalls to climb up and down. I later found out the flash flood rains dumped 3.5 inches in 24 hours locally causing erosion and as predicted, trail closures. It wasn’t until noon that I spotted my first Northbound hiker (unusual this time of year) and in total only saw 4 hikers total all day. One of the other brave souls I met Northbound though was a hiker I met in Tennessee, Next step. He and his wife which way started together and are also journaling on Trail journals.com but she injured her back and had to drop out midway. In any case we stopped in the rain and encouraged each other with news of what was to come, recommendations and “happy trails” then each pushed on to get the miles done we needed to for the day, rain or no rain. 
My destination that night was a unique hiker hostel in Rangely Maine called the Hiker Huts. Located .3 off the trail at a road crossing the property is “off the grid” meaning no electricity but does have propane for cooking and a hot shower. Many places have a so called “outdoor shower” which have privacy walls and such but nope... their outdoor shower is literally outdoors in the woods with an on demand propane hot water system fed by gravity from a roaring mt stream. The squirrels and chipmunks may be watching but all hikers get washed off “au naturel”. 
The “huts” are really glorified tool sheds but warm, dry and dressed up a bit with windows, curtains and some of the best gardens I’ve ever seen. The owner also has trained the chipmunks to eat from your hand and they are well fed so they don’t go into the huts or into your pack so I had no need of my pile of stones. 
The hostel drives you into town for dinner and resupply each night and the establishments have charge outlets and WiFi for his customers. While you eat and recharge, they wash clothes at a co-op laundromat in town as well. I was lucky enough to see the Red Sox beat up on the hapless Yankees which made the end of my wet and grueling day feel somehow worthwhile!","Sugarloaf Me

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600436,"Rangely to Andover ME
After a great stay at Rangely’s Hiker Hut I headed back into the woods southbound headed  for Andover Maine. AT hikers are often heard remarking how challenging Southern Maine is and all Northbound AT hikers are rocked back on their heels after NH’s infamous White Mts and Alpine terrain over the presidential range. I was anxious to see what lay ahead and eager to move into the next state south, NH.
The first 20 miles from Rangely though are relatively flat with a series of low ridges and ponds and lakes defining the trail. I head to Sabbath Day Pond for my first night but realize soon that the previous days flash flood has left the trail deep in mud. Non AT hikers may ask why don’t you just go around it but in thick underbrush or rocky locations the trail is the only path forward. In muddy conditions the solution is to stretch hop from rock, root and logs dropped in the mud as much as possible but the reality is you still slip off frequently and into ankle deep bog and the unnatural rhythm slows you down and tires you out.
 I plan to tent at a site which has tent platforms built to level out uneven terrain and get you out of the mud. Great plan except when I arrive, a French Canadian girls camp has taken over and is already set up on all platforms and dry level spaces. Hey, first come first serve is the rule on the AT even though these aren’t AT hikers they are entitled. I locate a reasonably level spot with only a couple of roots to stick into my back and find some semi-dry leaves in the woods to lay down under the tent to soak up the mud. 
I soon learn that camping in the proximity to 12 or 13 girl teenagers and a couple of counselors is a noisy and not very relaxing thing but I choose to stay put. I and several other AT thru hikers migrate down to the pond to talk hiking away from the constant chattering of the French speaking girls (they all seem to speak at the same time and one girl, obviously the class clown has perfected the art of burping loudly on demand and punctuates all their conversations with loud belching which everyone laughs at and the counselors roll their eyes at). 
Within 10 minutes all the girls come to the pond in fashionable swimsuits to wash off and cool off. How do you say in French “hey, that’s our drinking water too?”. 
Anyways they were probably pretty good kids and out for a fun adventure on the AT. I’ve seen worse from American teens for sure. 
The next day though the terrain becomes more challenging, steeper, rockier and up and over open topped Bemis Mt. I arrive mid afternoon at the Bemis Mt Shelter and set up my tent on a nice flat level and dry spot and other hikers arrive all afternoon filling in spots. It starts to get dark and then in the distance I hear “Alooo... are we there?”. The French Canadian campers have covered the same distance as I but in 3 more hours time and not all together so over the next hour, struggle into camp one by one, some in tears, some swearing in English and try to find the level tent spots which were non existent at that point.  It took them till 10 pm to set up, eat dinner and settle down.  It’s the only time on the trail in the woods I’ve pulled out ear plugs and stuffed them in. I also wondered if they knew what they had got themselves into as the next day led up and over rocky and steep Mt Blue. 
I head out early and across more open ledges with views across beautiful lakes in the Maine countryside. The past week has been uncharacteristicly warm and humid. The Maine woods are usually cool and breezy but this feels hot and oppressive as I hike on. I climb to the top of Mt Blue which is the height of land in the range and where I was advised to call the Andover Pine Ellis hostel from so they can send a shuttle. We agree on 2.5 hours to meet on South Arm road. I meet about 6 Nobo’s sitting on top of the Mountain stretched out and resting heavily but didn’t think to ask them how the climb up was. I headed southbound and down the mountain. The trail gets steeper and rockier, then very steep rock face. Then steel rebar rod ladders bolted into the rock. Negotiating these type of climbs are vastly different with a 20 lb full backpack vs a light daypack or no pack at all. The steep drop into the notch below continued all the way to the roadside below and sure enough it took exactly 2.5 hours to drop the elevation. 
I caught the shuttle into Andover and stayed two nights at Pine Ellis hostel near the small depressed downtown. Town merchants were glad to see AT hikers walk in to buy food and supplies as the town has lost a lot of jobs as the logging industry and furniture factory in town closed or changed due to technological automation.
I arranged a slackpack hike for the next day up and over a 10 mile stretch southbound and was dropped off trail side at 8:30 am. It had rained hard overnight in town and i assume in the mountains as well. The trail starts on the other side of a rushing river with no bridge so I start the day taking off my boots and wading thigh deep and then drying off and redressing my feet before setting off up the equally steep slope as I had just come down the previous day. As I climbed up past some stealth tent spots near the river I was amused to hear... French Canadian chattering from the girls camp. I give them credit for perseverance and spunk. I never saw them again on my southbound trek. 
The day hike contained 4 steep rocky miles and the 6 long gradual miles out to the pick up point. I made it back to the hostel and was surprised to two good hiking buddies from the Northbound trek, Detail and Maverick. We shared stories over beers, compared weight losses and then walked into town for a good dinner. 
After a good nights rest, i caught the 7 am shuttle to the next trailhead and headed up and into the last section of the trail before NH.","Rangely Maine

The Pine Ellis shuttle dropped me at the AT trailhead at 7:30 am and I headed off into a cloudy misty morning. The next mountain range south is called Bald Pate referring to the smooth rounded rock summits of two individual peaks, Little Bald Pate and Big Bald. For the first three miles though the trail winds through the woods and over minor ridges. The mist became a steady rain which concerned me as David the shuttle driver had warned me the top of the Bald’s get very slippery when wet. 
I pushed on towards the tree line determined to climb safely but to make steady progress throughout the day towards the NH state line. Climbing through the tree line involved more ladders and one steep cliff where a climbing rope was permanently attached to provide safe hand holds as one scaled a 20 foot vertical face. Once on the exposed rock slab of little Pate, the rain ended and a stiff 20 MPH breeze helped to dry off the rock making progress quicker than I thought. By mid afternoon I was on the down slope towards Grafton Notch which is a beautiful jagged cliff-faced valley separating two ridges. The far side of the Notch climbs steeply up along waterfalls that come off a famous Maine mountain called Old Speck. Descending into the Notch though, a thunderstorm rolled in quickly with lightning and a drenching downpour. A Northbound hiker passing me though shared good news that at the road crossing and parking area in the Notch, a Maine based backpacking company called “Hyperlight” was hosting major trail magic. I walked on through the downpour, wondering what would be served as it was late afternoon now and I was hungry after burning my daily 6000 - 7000 calories! When I arrived at the parking lot, they had a gas grill turning out hot dogs, brats and burgers to a crowd of 10 through hikers and beer, soda, chips and fruit. I dropped my pack in a puddle and ate two brats with peppers and onions in about 3 minutes flat! Yum! They also were handling out goody bags with all Maine based companies products like Freeze dried food, energy bars and hyperlight stuff sacks. Great trail magic. 
I intended to climb a mile or two up Old Speck and to stealth camp for the night as the light was getting dimmer by the minute. On the climb out  of the Notch I ran into a hiking buddy, RTK from my Northbound AT trek and we stopped a few minutes to catch up on our travels but I told him to hurry down the trail to get some of the trail magic too. Just one through hiker looking out for another. 
The next morning was beautiful and crisp like fall had arrived in New England even though it was still early August. I had a huge day ahead which included up and over Old Speck itself, around the beautiful high alpine lake called Speck pond and then down the single steepest trail on the entire Appalachian Trail called the Mahossuc Arm. The rock on Old Spec is granite but a particular continuous flow slab of rock so the trail runs steeply down a 1600 foot vertical drop in about a distance of one mile. It is dizzying as you can see the steep drop off below you. In places, there was still water running down it from the previous days rain but generally my boots were holding the friction needed to stay upright on a very steep pitch. It would have been much easier to go up this trail than down but such is life. 
After this very strenuous descent the trail then winds up in a steep rocky Notch called Mahoussuc Notch which is infamous as “the toughest mile of the AT”. The reason for this is the bottom of the Notch is filled with a crazy jumble of house sized boulders that fell from the cliffs above and the trail goes arbitrarily over, around and under these boulders. The AT is traditionally marked with white paint blazes from Georgia to Maine but here the trail is not marked and is “everyone for themselves” leaving you to explore pathways that may or may not be passable. For example you may spend 10 minutes climbing hand over hand up a 30 foot boulder only to peak over the top to see a deep pit on the other side that only a climbing rope could allow you to rappel down. In other cases you have to take off your backpack and crawl into a cave and push your bag sight unseen into an opening and let the bag drop into the dark hoping it will be ok while you wriggle in after it not even knowing if the cave will lead you to the next boulders along the way. At one cave that I crawled into I noticed it was very cold and I could see my breath like in the winter so I crawled deeper into the cave to explore and found some leftover snow and ice in August! It never melts! 
I do consider myself a pretty good climber and have always enjoyed rock climbing and boulder scrambling like this. At times I was balancing on top of a knife edge rock 25 feet in the air walking along towards a leap of 3 - 4 feet to the next rock, in a very remote area where it would take hours before rescue or medical help ever could reach you if an accident should occur. In the end it took me two full hours to make it through the one mile gauntlet and this was on a beautiful sunny day. I can only imagine how long this takes in the rain or snow, if even possible. 
At the south end of the Notch the AT turns and climbs steeply up a one mile slope complete with steel ladders to a mountain called Full Goose and in the col beyond that a Shelter with tenting platforms where I thankfully called it a day after a lot of strenuous adventure. As I reviewed maps and plans for the next day I was excited to realize the state line was just another 8 miles away and then my next stop of Gorham NH another 15 miles beyond that. 
I pushed towards the State line all next morning hoping to make it there by noon but the terrain was still very steep ridges that the trail climbs and descends with deep mud bogs in unlikely places. I’ve come to hate the plank bridges the trail crews have placed over many of the bogs as they are slippery and in some cases have become loose or even just floating on top of the mud. I’ve fallen repeatedly and now slow walk across them like an old man. I met a Northbound hiker this day covered in mud up over her knees in tears over a bad spill in what she thought was only shallow mud but then found out just how deep it was! 
Just before the state line there is one more steep climb up a cliff that required hand over hand rock climbing and working your way up a narrow V channel leaving you about 15 feet in the air before you have to muscle up over a lip of rock. This was a real workout with a 20 lb backpack on your back. 
I took a congratulatory selfie at the state line and paused to realize I’d just completed 358 miles southbound on the AT (the second longest state on the AT) and it had been much harder and more rugged than I had ever planned for but now had to face the New Hampshire White Mts also known to be extremely steep, rocky and home to the worst weather in the US on top of the Presidential range. 
I camped about 6 miles short of the Gorham NH road crossing and a hiker hostel I planned to stay at called Rattle River Lodge. I planned to walk out and check in about mid day making it a “Nero” or also known as a near zero day allowing rest and recuperation. 
Upon arrival the hostel staff explained that before getting inside the house everyone gets showered in a hiker mud room and drops off dirty laundry and changes into clean but misfitting loaner clothes. The stay was great with a private room, breakfast included, laundry included and shuttles into town for dinner and resupply.","Andover Maine

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601158,"Gorham NH over Presidential range to Crawford Notch
After settling into the Rattle River Hostel in Gorham and resupplying in town I made arrangements to slackpack the following day. A slackpack day is one where an AT hiker doesn’t carry their full pack which slows us down or makes particularly steep or slippery trails more dangerous when climbing or descending. In this case the next morning I caught a 7 am shuttle with 3 other hikers to Pinkham Notch base camp which the AMC operates at the foot of Mt Washington. I then spent the next 14 hours hiking the 21 mile Wildcat, Carter and Moriah Range all the way back to Rattle River which the AT passes directly by. Because the terrain and logistics work better for Northbound hikers, even though I am a southbound flip flop through hiker, in this case I was headed north. 
The Wildcat cliffs form one dramatic side of Pinkham Notch and are in every way a challenging climb in themselves with toeholds chiseled out of the granite and in some places wooden steps drilled into rock face. Once on top of the cliffs, I climbed each of the four linked Wildcat peaks including the one with the ski gondola summit station. The trail then drops steeply into Carter Notch where the AMC has one of its huts where I stopped for water refills before climbing the tallest mountain in the range, Carter Dome. 
Trail crews have reworked many of the white mountain trails that are subject to erosion by placing boulders the size of a large suitcase directly up the trail like a steep oversized staircase. In this case, the staircase would be similar to the Empire State Building climbing directly to the top... do not pass Go! Put that in your Fitbit! 
The morning that had started promising started to deteriorate to low scudding clouds and mists making the rocks slippery. I made it to the top for lunch with no views but an excellent cell signal so I could call and wish my wife Kim a Happy Birthday from the mountain top. I attempted to sing to her happy birthday but the animals and birds protested loudly! 
I continued my hike mindful of the 21 mile total distance and the time darkness would be setting in the mountains. I still had the steep and rocky Carter range with its 3 peaks and the open slab summit of Mt Moriah before a 6 mile descent back down to the hostel. I knew I would finish in the dark and had brought a headlamp and other emergency gear just in case but I really wanted to push myself to at least be off the slick and steep sections before darkness. Other than water breaks (umm, both in and out) and my phone call I walked nonstop the entire 21 mile day. In the end I walked the final 3 miles under headlamp and on autopilot but finally walked into the hiker mud room just before 9 pm and hit the showers and laundry again before being allowed in to my waiting bed upstairs! 
I took a planned rest day the next day that consisted of cleaning and repacking equipment, catching a nap, talking on the phone with my wife, doing as little walking as possible and grilling a massive steak and potato over the grill the hostel provides. The next day was the long awaited climb to Mt Washington which is the highest peak in New England and has miles of above tree line trails to navigate. 
I again took the 7am shuttle right back to Pinkham Notch where I started two days prior but this time headed southbound on the AT. From Pinkham the AT swings north to enter the Great Gulf wilderness, crosses the auto road and then climbs steeply to tree line before going over Mt Madison and Adams. Again in the valley the sun had been shining, warm temperatures and blue skies but upon breaking tree line the clouds lowered and the winds started to whip. I had seen thunderstorms forecast for the afternoon and my destination was Lakes of the Clouds Hut high on Mt Washington and wanted to be there before they hit above tree line. 
I’ve climbed Mt Washington and all the Presidential range numerous times but it is always spectacular to be there and memorable. I confess this trip with the cloud cover and winds whipping and the threat of storms made me pass up and over the summit without a second thought and then arriving at the hut about 15 minutes to spare before they served dinner. 
The hut holds 90 people and as we sat down to dinner the thunderstorms started and rain poured heavy on the tin roof. As I lay in my bunk that night I thought that if the weather cleared in the morning it might be worthwhile to climb the hour back up to the top but as morning dawned it was every bit as cloudy, drizzly and with winds forecast to gust to 60 so I canned that idea and set out right after breakfast to cross the southern Presidential range and down over Webster cliffs to Crawford Notch making for a total two day hike of 26 miles over very rough conditions. I felt glad to have it behind me but in some sense wanted it to never end. I also realized how many good memories of hiking with my father were tied to this special place and I’ve been thinking a lot about him on this section of the trip and missing him and his wisdom. 
When I got to Crawford Notch Trail head I made a reservation at the AMC Highland center which is about 7 miles away
And decided to try my hand at hitchhiking which I tend to avoid but in this case it worked out with a ride in a pickup truck (throw that stinking pack in the back please!) and had a nice conversation with a couple from Portsmouth NH. 
I checked in and exploded my pack to clean everything as best I could but realized the very fibers and cushioning of the pack have a dead and decaying aroma that follows me everywhere and flies and mosquitoes fall to the ground on approach. 
I ate a massive dinner (AMC facilities believe in AYCE...All you can eat) and crashed early  in preparation for the next days hike.","Gorham NH

Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602982,"Crawford Notch to Franconia Notch
In the New Hampshire White Mts the geography is defined by steep valleys that thread between the various mountain ranges that make up the White Mountain National forest. Pinkham Notch, Crawford Notch, Franconia Notch and Kinsman Notch are the major ones but all are defined with steep cliffs and ledges and roads through the valley floor where early settlers threaded through this state and established towns, farms and other forms of civilization. 
I caught a ride out of the AMC Highland Center with two older gentlemen from Providence RI whom I’d met the previous night over another typical AMC AYCE dinner. They used to hike extensively but now in their seventies only got out for short day hikes occasionally but still enjoyed the outdoors and the camaraderie of the AMC facilities. They dropped me off at the AT trailhead for Ripley falls and Ethan Pond and I set off into an area I have hiked many times and in all four seasons. I made good time as most of the trail here followed logging roads after climbing steeply up and out of Crawford Notch. I planned to stop at the AMC Zealand Falls Hut to take a lunch break and water up before climbing steeply up to Zeacliff Mountain and my plan was to stealth camp around the top of the Zeacliffs which are dramatic and provide open views down into the wilderness I’d just walked through that morning. That plan was perfect but for the clouds rolling in again and starting an all night rain just as I set up my tent about 15 feet from the cliffs edge. Once again I was thankful for my larger 2 person tent allowing cooking and eating space as well as a dry sleeping space for the night.
The next day continued the drizzle and low scudding clouds as I climbed over Mt Guyot, Mt Garfield and Twin Mt (yes...there are two peaks) enroute to the Garfield ridge campsite. I have done this ridge trail before but was amazed still by its beauty and open topped mountains with mossy, rocky summits. I had forgotten though that the AT actually climbs up a waterfall that coincides with the trail for about 300 feet just before reaching the spur trail to the campsite. Due to the rocky uneven geography of this area,  the AMC built wooden tent platforms as well as a 12 person Shelter here. Since there’s a cross-over bubble of Northbound and Southbound AT hikers as well as section hikers, there are 47 people camped here in the rain. On my platform we manage to set up three tents closely side by side. By opening side flaps we socialize over dinner prep and eating. I meet a hiker from Israel and two guys just out of the military and sharing a one person tent! Close quarters!
The next day dawns clear and windy which is great as I need to dry out my tent and sleeping bag from two days of wetness. I string up some drying lines out of my bear hang paracord and wait around till about 10 am when everything feels dry enough to pack up. 
My good friend Paul Glatkowski has agreed to meet me the following day on Mt Lafayette and as a result I have only a 6 mile hike ( a Nero... near zero) along a ridge to the top of Mt Lafayette and then a mile down to another AMC hut called Greenleaf Hut where I’ll overnight and then meet Paul the following morning before continuing my southbound hike with Paul into Franconia Notch. 
I arrive at lunchtime on top of Mt Lafayette and incredibly count over 75 people on the exposed sunny rocky summit including a Wedding party with Bride and Groom changing into gown and tux for wedding photos (but not the ceremony as far as I can see).  This has always been a popular large mountain in NH and has become even more so with the extension of Interstate Route 93 right through Franconia Notch. But 75 people is overcrowded and jarring to my senses after the quiet and relative solitude of the AT so far. I also have fond memories of Mt Lafayette as this was the first big mountain my father took me hiking on when I was 5 years old, starting a life long love of the outdoors and of mountains in particular. Those were simpler times and certainly less crowded so I eat my lunch quickly, snap a few pictures and push down the trail to check into the hut. 
The AMC hut is pretty much as I remembered it, with a central dining and gathering room and bunk rooms off either side to accommodate the 40 people the hut can hold. I spend the afternoon relaxing on the deck looking up at the rocky summit above the hut and chatting with the crew that mans the hut and other guests. Again the AMC provides a large AYCE  dinner and breakfast included in the stay price. Not all AT hikers can afford to pay to stay and eat at the 8 AMC huts so there is a “work-for-stay” option that up to 4 through hikers can get chosen for each night but it involves waiting outside while all guests get fed  then the WFS hikers get cold leftovers, have to wash dishes, sweep off floors, etc before getting to lay out sleeping bags on the dining room floor (not on a mattress in the bunkhouse) after all guests have gone to sleep. Remember that through hikers typically hike all day over 20 miles and typically are asleep in bed by dark if not earlier so this WFS program is not really the greatest. Likewise in the morning, WFS are sent outside to wait until guests are done before eating cold leftovers, then doing dishes, sweeping and maybe in the trail by 9:30 or 10. I have chosen to Pay-for-stay for obvious reasons, not the least is that I can afford it and get an AMC member discount! 
My friend Paul arrives at Greenleaf around 10 am after hiking 3 miles up from Franconia and then we climb the steep mile back up to the AT on the top of Mt Lafayette and continue southbound along the steep rocky Ridge over Mt Liberty, Lafayette, Haystack and Flume before descending back into the Notch at end of day where Paul started that morning. 
I intend to stay a couple of nights in Woodstock NH, a small mountain town just south of Franconia Notch and have my friends Paul and Charlene drop me off at a motel before they head home to Concord NH.","Crawford Notch NH

Franconia Notch to Hanover NH
I decide to take advantage of Woodstock’s central location and arrange for two days of slack-packing while staying out at the Autumn breeze motel. This allows me to cover more distance quickly but also I know the trail gets more challenging over the Kinsman and Moosilauke ranges including lots of rock climbing, open peaks and ladders to negotiate. 
The owner of the motel shuttles me back to Franconia Notch where Paul and I left off the night before and I get a 7 am start on a 17 mile day over Cannon Mt, Lonesome Lake and North and South Kinsman peaks before a very steep descent into Kinsman Notch. I carry basic food and water as well as a first aid kit and headlamp in case this takes longer than I think but am pretty confident I’ll be out before dark.
As I remembered, there are numerous ledges to scale over these peaks with ladders and wooden steps screwed to cliff face in some instances to assist climbers. Enroute southbound I meet separately two AT through hikers I’ve met either in the first half or on the second half. In one case, I recognize a 70 year old whose trail-name is Loner who is currently on his 6th AT through hike (The ATC awards a 2000 miler patch to all successful hikers and Loner already has 5 patches sewed to his hiking shirt that looks kind of like a safari shirt). I originally met him at McAfee’s Knob in VA before I flipped up to Mt Katahdin. Now to set the scene, Loner is a dead-ringer for the old neighbor character in “Home Alone 1” with the snow shovel. Today however he’s dripping blood out of a gash on his shin and I inquire if he’s ok. He laughs in a soft, wild eyed way that gives me the creeps and says ”sometimes you have to give the mountain some blood...” and keeps on shuffling northward. I turn and watch his slow progress wondering what the trail up ahead has in store for me. 
Later that afternoon I cross paths with “Lil Red” a much younger and stronger hiker from Portland Maine that has been southbound with me much of the way from Maine. He is a faster hiker than I am but often gets stuck in towns for several days wherever there’s companionship, inexpensive lodging, food and beer. Today though He’s flying up the trail but sweating like a marathon runner and pauses quickly to explain he’s slack packing this section too but he decided to do it Northbound and has a hard deadline shuttle pick up at 6 pm in Franconia Notch back up where I started at 7 am that morning and he had much more than halfway to go. He sarcastically stated “I obviously chose the wrong direction to go in” before racing off in desperate hopes of making his deadline. Again I didn’t quite know what I had before me but at least I didn’t have a deadline but just had to call for a ride when needed. I soon hit the south Kinsman cliff which obviously was the offending blood taker for Loner and the cause for Lil Red’s haste. Multiple Steep ledges of 30 - 50 feet high without ladders and in many cases with seeping water making them slippery caused me to carefully climbdown the trail, sometimes backwards like a ladder.  In most cases, the dynamics for climbing are easier going up a cliff than down it. Where toe holds or hand holds provide security against falls when ascending, going down can cause slips and extra exertion and take extra time. 
In the end I completed the 17 Mile day at 5:30, well before dark and called for my shuttle back to Woodstock and a good dinner and a couple of local beers.
The next day I again slackpack southbound over Mt Moosilauke but overnight a strong wind driven rain has fallen continuously and the climb up Moosilauke is notoriously steep and follows a rushing waterfall along a dangerous half mile . At several points on the climb I can reach my hand out from the cliff and dip it into the waterfall. There are warning signs and whenever the word “fatal” is included in the warnings it usually catches my attention pretty good... but again I would much rather be climbing up this cliff in the driving rain than down it. I again start at 7 am and it is almost 9:30 am before I see anyone on the trail and it is two serious looking Japanese climbers heading North and down the waterfall route. We stop briefly and I warn them and give advice on some safer options and they politely nod and push on in the rain. As I near the open top of Mt Moosilauke I come across a 8 man trail maintenance crew moving boulders and trying to work in the heavy rain and wind to improve trail conditions. You could see on their faces how much it sucked and how wet and muddy they were. While this used to be a volunteer job, in the National Forest the Federal government hires contractors to do these jobs. I simply said “Thank you for doing this” and passed them. On the descent on the south side of Moosilauke (decidedly less steep) the rain stopped and as I was splashing along the muddy trail knew I had one river crossing that my AT guidebook warned was not crossed by a bridge but had to be waded (really not a big deal most days in the summer) and today the streams and rivers were swollen from the heavy rain. It was right before a road where I would call the shuttle for my ride back for a final night in Woodstock. I got to the river and prepared to pull off my boots and start wading when I looked upstream a hundred yards and saw a massive tree had fallen across the river and all I had to do was bushwhack up to the tree and climb up on the trunk and balance walk 50 feet across the river. Cool! I was able to get across without stripping off my boots and got to the road only to find out there is no cell service in this area of NH. I pull out my AT guide and note there is a hiker hostel about a half mile from the trail crossing and walk there where I’m able to talk the hostel owner to driving me back into town but due to topography of roads and mountains in this area takes 45 minutes to drive around to the other side. In any case, back to my last night in the motel and a hot shower before heading into the back country again headed southbound towards Hanover NH where Dartmouth college is located and the border with VT is located. 
Now that I’ve technically left the White Mts I am not sure exactly what to expect but head out the next morning in nice weather and determined to push on till dark to make a two day journey over the remaining NH territory. Mt Moosilauke is the last large mountain over 4000 feet until the trail goes over Killington in Vermont in about a week. 
I follow the trail over multiple small hills leading to Cube Mt and Smarts Mt which are the tallest in this section. Neither are particularly steep but Cube Mt is made up of pure white rock quartzite. From the open top I first can look into neighboring Vermont even though it’s still two days walk away before crossing the border. I tent near a roaring stream still full from the recent rains and I note the ground in this area is saturated and spongy. I put a waterproof ground cloth under the tent but still have to figure some dampness will seep into the tent. At this point my favorite two man Big Agnes tent has been through all kinds of weather and high winds. It has been set up and taken down hundreds of times. The fabric is getting stretched, dirty and thin and I know it’s days are numbered. I will retire this tent at the end of the southbound trek assuming it lasts that long although it has become a familiar and trustworthy piece of equipment. 
I head up and over Smarts Mt the next day after reading that the trail goes through very wet and boggy area near the two peaks and is crossed by plank bridges and logs that hikers have tossed into mud trying to cross safely. Some hikers warn that some of the bridges are old and no longer attached to anything secure but rather are floating on deep muddy swamp ready to sink under your weight dropping a hiker into the muck. I cautiously walk over approximately 100 plank bridges this morning and even though warned, find one where there is no way around and when I step onto it, get dumped knee deep into swamp as quickly as stepping onto water. I fall onto my knees and crawl out of the bog laughing out loud like a crazed swamp creature. I get to the other side and try to wipe mud off my legs and socks but both boots have filled up and are like heavy sponges on my feet. There’s nothing to do but hike on knowing that I’ll dry out as the day goes on. I planned a long day trying to get close to Hanover NH where I plan to meet my friends Paul and Charlene again as they’ve graciously offered a shower, bed and meals at their house in Concord NH. I make it a 21 mile day, ending near a campsite situated on a island between two rivers and arrive there after dark hiking under headlamp and set up the tent and cook dinner but before climbing into my sleeping bag I strip down and jump into the stream to wash off caked on swamp mud and wash out my socks. I also do the usual bear bag hang as I’ve described elsewhere and went to bed with my food dangling about 20 feet in the air. 
During the night I hear the scratching of mice claws on he sides of my tent and it has happened before in other locations. I wake up just enough to locate the rodent and then launch him by sharply hitting the wall of the tent making for the first NH mouse in space. 
In the morning I crawl out of the tent and set the water to boil for my breakfast of coffee, oatmeal and pop tarts. Upon lowering the bear bag I noticed a gaping hole in the side of my nylon waterproof sack and quickly dump out the contents onto the ground and determine mice have climbed the tree, shimmied down the thin paracord and eaten into my food. They’ve nibbled into almost all my food bags, eaten into all my snickers bars (I eat 2-3 a day! I need Calories!) and protein bars. I try to salvage a few uncontaminated things and clean mouse droppings out of the bag. This would have been more serious if it was the first night out with a weeks worth of food but I only lose a couple of days worth and only have about 8 miles to go to meet my friends and will have access to resupply in town. 
I meet the Glatkowski’s in Hanover mid afternoon and they bring their motorboat with them for an afternoon on nearby Lake Sunapee and a sunset picnic dinner. It’s a great break from hiking in the muddy mountains and Paul and I jump into the lake from the boat and is a good chance to rinse off (I notice fish floating up in the general vicinity of the grungy AT through hiker/swimmer) and later that night get a well needed shower and sleep well in a soft bed. This break is great but it also emphasizes the fact that I’ve hiked through NH, one of the toughest states on the Appalachian Trail and next day I’ll head into the Green Mts of Vermont after walking through the campus of Dartmouth college."," Franconia Notch NH
",Hanover NH,"Aug 27, Mon",70
Atlas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603084,"Hanover NH to Killington VT
My friend Paul drops me back in Hanover NH at the food store he picked me up at the previous day and I walk on streets for the next 4 miles through Hanover, the campus of Dartmouth and then across the Connecticut River which forms the boundaries between NH and VT. I walk through Norwich VT and finally off the pavement and thankfully into the woods. 
It’s funny that a through hikers feet and legs get conditioned to be able to walk 20 - 25 mikes a day over rocks, mud, forest and gravel with no problem but walking on pavement for even a couple of miles is torture. 
Hiking in Vermont is very different than NH, Maine or any of the southern states. The landscape is rolling hills, open dairy farm fields, and no open rocky top summits. On the other hand, instead of climbing up and over 3 or 4 4000 foot mountains each day, here a day may have 8 to 10 1000 foot hills. You get the sensation of a roller coaster as the trail seems to go directly up the hill and then directly down the other side with no switchbacks or steps. The path underfoot is soft pine needles or crushed leaves in the woods and dense grass and “cow pies” in the dairy fields. 
Due to the recent rains though, mosquitoes have re-emerged as if it was spring again and I have to restart using DEET insect repellent but  they still manage to get in my eyes, ears and bite my ankles as I walk through the day. 
I select the top of a high rounded hill my first night in Vermont to stealth camp and plan ahead to carry up sufficient water. I actually refill today from a hose at a hiker friendly house in one of the valleys as the water in this section is often contaminated by flowing through cow and goat populated fields. While I do filter or boil all my drinking water on the trail and have had zero incidents of sickness I don’t choose to tempt fate. 
In NH the nights had started to cool off considerably and a couple of nights in the White Mts were below the comfort zone of my summer weight 35 degree sleeping bag. My wife Kim had shipped my warmer 20 degree bag to our friends in Concord and I had swapped out. She also sent a special care package of high density/high calorie Protein chocolate and cherry balls for snacks. I love these and crave more calories every day as my weight continues to drop with the extended hiking day after day. I gladly add the extra pounds to my backpack knowing they were made with love. 
As often happens in New England, late summer chills can sometimes turn back to Indian Summer and I note the days getting warm and muggy again and I spend my nights sleeping on top of the warmer sleeping bag. 
In Vermont, the AT runs east/west from the NH border until it joins the Long trail on Mt Killington where it then runs true North/South. The Vermont long trail runs from the MA border all the way to Canada but only 100 or so miles coincide with the AT. I’ve skied most of the Vermont mountains but am unfamiliar with the trail and find it interesting and different from other hiking trails. 
I plan to overnight at the Killington motel just off the AT at a road crossing and resupply and rest up before heading south. I feel somewhat lethargic in the newly formed heat wave and have trouble sleeping in the sticky humid tent. My mileage per day is slipping and I can tell I need a break soon or a break in the weather so I push on towards civilization. 
 If anything the mosquitoes have intensified and despite the repellent I’m suffering bites and welts daily on my exposed legs, arms and neck. I get really good at swatting and smashing mosquitoes without breaking stride and think nothing about the smashed bloody carcasses in my hair, beard, ears etc. Only when I stop to talk to another hiker and see the same bloodied results on them do I realize I look a fright and make sure to wash off in a stream each day the carnage. 
I continue two more days through the nameless, faceless rolling landscape sleeping in a tent each night but dreaming of a shower, a bed and air conditioning. Upon reaching Killington village I check in and head for a long shower before seeking food in the village. I also check the weather forecast and find a cold front expected to roll through overnight causing rain but providing a few days of cooler temperatures. 
  
One thing I do whenever I’m in a hostel, motel or house is to “explode” my pack and get everything out for airing, drying and cleaning if it’s needed. I think the management might be upset if they walked in and saw tents draped over dressers, sleeping bags hung in closets, boots and socks propped over AC vents to dry but I’m always respectful of their property and clean up when re-packing in the morning.","Hanover NH

Killington VT to North Adams Ma 108 miles

After resting and recovering in the Killington Motel’s air-conditioned comfort I woke to a steady rain hitting the window and with it the forecasted change in temperatures. I packed up at dawn and went to the included breakfast at the motel and discussed with two other AT thru-hikers our best course of action. We saw on the weather app that the rain would taper off and end by noon but not wanting to waste an entire half day of hiking, agreed a mid-morning departure and only a couple of hours of soaking made sense so we indulged in a second and third cup of excellent home roasted coffee while sharing our stories. 
One of the other hikers was a 68 year old doctor from Alaska (“…trail name is Bill cause that’s what doctors do!”) headed northbound who had jumped ahead earlier in the season and already done the entire section of the trail in Maine so he only had to get from Killington VT through New Hampshire to the Maine border to be “done”. He was very interested in our experiences and tips about the trail in the White Mts of New Hampshire and seemed to have a dread of them as many hikers describe them as the hardest section of the trail but personally after having just done Maine in the slippery conditions I experienced, wasn’t so sure about that. 
The other hiker at breakfast was a young chef from New Orleans with the trail name “SammerWise” who was taking a year off from work (Guess you can do that easily when you are a good chef…) and was southbound hiking what is known as the International Appalachian Trail. This entails starting way north in New Brunswick Province, Canada then thru Quebec Province before crossing northern Maine before climbing the peak of Mt Katahdin, then following the 2190 mile entirety of the AT southbound to Springer Mt Georgia then on several connecting trails through Alabama to the Florida National trail which runs the entire length of the state ending in Key West FL ! I had heard vague references to this trail before, but Sam was the first hiker I met actually doing it. His daily mileage was somewhere between 25 and 30 everyday which is a fast, consistent pace.

In order to restart on the AT though I had to hitchhike a 2 mile segment of a VT road back to the trailhead or walk it all uphill in the rain, a very unappealing idea at the time. I stuck my thumb out not expecting anyone to want a wet hiker in their car when a pick-up pulled over and found it was the owner of the Motel running errands and offered all three of us rides to the trailhead.

I started back on the trail by 10:30 and the first steep section of trail skirted across and up the backside of the Killington Ski resort which includes Pico Mt. The rain tapered off and the cooler temperatures ensured I kept moving to stay warm whereas two days earlier I had been sweating and complaining of the heat!  Killington Mt is significant in that it will be the last 4000-foot mountain I have to climb headed southbound back to Harpers Ferry WV. Southern Vermont and Massachusetts have many 2000- and 3000-foot mountains but this is the last big one and I push hard to make the top of Killington by lunchtime. The summits are in dense clouds making a soft, spooky landscape with no views and a hushed quiet that comes in fog and snow. While the AT doesn’t cross any of the actual ski trails, it comes close enough in several places to look out on the trails and near enough the summit to hear the whirling noise of the Killington Summit Gondola delivering fall tourist to the summit, if there had been any sights to actually see. I only see a few people on the trail all day knowing it is getting too late for Northbound AT hikers to complete this year although would have expected many more Long Trail hikers on this famous section during the fall.

My destination that first night is Clarendon shelter with good tenting options about 17 miles south of Killington and a pleasant walk through State forest lands and along a rocky river. I arrive as dark is settling in and find one Northbound Long trail hiker and his beautiful Labrador retriever in the shelter but I always prefer my tent and set up on the edge of a field about 100 yards from the shelter. I carry my dinner up to the shelter to talk to the hiker and pat his dog who is super affectionate. At about 8 pm as I’m climbing into my sleeping bag, in walks the hiker SammerWise under headlamp who in addition to the 17 miles I did that day had to go back and finish a 6 mile section further North of Killington and then stop at the Killington Post Office to retrieve a resupply package he had sent to himself! Pretty impressive.

The next day I was pushing to get closer to my next stop on the Vermont section of the AT which was Manchester VT but that is another 33 miles south so I decide to push on a long day and aim to camp high on Baker Peak which will give me a respectable 21 mile day with multiple small peaks and valleys to traverse. One peak is called Stone Mountain and has several open rock fields that are marked on my maps as “Rock Gardens” which I puzzled over and looked forward in anticipation to seeing what these would turn out to be. The rock fields have become freeform sculpture gardens where people stack and arrange the stones into Piles, Symbols, etc. and the Appalachian trail walks thru the center of these. In some cases, Stones are piled up to make inviting benches to rest on and look out at the Rock Gardens. At one of these I see a group of three young hikers working to stack rocks into several 7 foot high spires only to see it come crashing down as it neared its highest point. Uncomplainingly, they started to rebuild as I walked on.

In order to camp up at the peak, required a late afternoon water fill-up often called “Camelling up” as you have to store and carry water when its not available.. I fill a total of 4 liters which is enough to get through a dinner and breakfast and some extra to carry for emergency until the next water source and load that onto my pack for the final 3 miles and arrive at the rocky summit in time for a dim and hazy sunset. I had read in the guide there was a couple of stealth sites up high near tree line and locate one in time to get the tent up and dinner going before the next round of rain and wind gusts roll in. There’s little protection for my tent up here and before turning in for the night, I put on raingear and retighten ropes and weigh down the tent with rocks by the light of my headlamp. As I was doing so, a solo Northbound hiker came through by headlamp and we shared tips of the trail ahead. She was heading 3 miles further that night to where I had filled up with water and had started that morning 13 miles south in Manchester where I would be the next day. I fall asleep to the loud flapping of the tent fly in the heavy winds.

I actually had the good fortune to know two friends in Manchester and had two very nice offers to stay over a night or two with them. My wife’s second cousin lives there and is an avid outdoorswoman but unfortunately came down with a painful case of the shingles a couple of days before my arrival and we agreed perhaps it would be best not to visit this time around. 
 

My other friend who lives there arranged to meet me at a road crossing and took me into town to their beautiful house they just built. We hadn’t seen each other in a very long time but we immediately picked up the friendship again and made a great afternoon and evening of it. In addition to a much-needed shower and laundry, Cathy had tickets to the local theater and arranged to go out with friends for a wonderful dinner. It was almost dreamlike to go from hiking an average of 18 miles a day and eating simple freeze-dried meals to a delicious restaurant meal and live theater performance and then a very comfortable bed. I also found I was somewhat of a celebrity in town where Cathy had let a lot of her friends know about my AT trek so I had many opportunities to explain “life on the trail”

I restart on the trail mid-morning after a wonderful homemade breakfast and quick resupply stop in town. I still had the next steep section of trail coming up over Stratton Mt which also contains a well-known southern Vermont ski area but first needed to cross a swampy, low lying area and around the good sized Stratton Mt pond. As I approached the pond, I looked up the trail about 200 feet ahead saw the first Moose of the entire trip. I had expected to see many moose in Maine particularly in Baxter Park but hadn’t spotted any on my Southbound journey. I quickly grabbed for my iPhone to take a picture as Moose are usually slow moving and not afraid at all of humans but this one surprised me by turning and taking off at full gallop into the brush like a skittish horse might react. Nope, no photos on this sighting!

I plan ahead for a night near the top of Stratton Mt at a stealth spot near a small spring that flows across the trail. My AT guide tells me it is easier to spot the site when headed Northbound than Southbound and I have to search several places before locating the stealth site well-hidden about 50 feet off the trail. With the late start and the steepness of the trail I only make a 14-mile day but by doing so, have a manageable three days now to cross the MA border and my next town stop and resupply in North Adams MA. I’m starting to feel the excitement of making strong progress on the trail and the closeness of a state border always is a motivational and exciting event on a through hike.

I continue the next morning south on the AT with one more large mountain range to cross and plan again to stealth camp high on the last peak in Southern Vermont called Glastonbury Mt which has a fire tower and shelter near the top. It’s an easy 15.5 mile day and arrive mid-afternoon to spend time up in the abandoned fire tower and watching big storm clouds building in the west. My tent is up and clothes are drying out on a line but it feels too early to eat dinner so I talk on the phone and work on planning out the next couple of weeks which will include a nice break off the trail with a visit with my wife in Gloucester MA. I decide to reclimb the fire tower as I can hear thunder rumbling in the distance. (Yes, I’m aware that’s not necessarily the smart or safe thing to do but decide to take a chance on the grounding cables that old steel structure fire towers had to protect them and the fire rangers from Lightning storms). 
I get a spectacular view of two thunderstorms rolling into each other as they move closer to me. Then after about 30 minutes of watching this awesome display of nature and hearing the first rain drops starting to hit the metal roof of the fire tower, I suddenly remember my clothes and sleeping bag are hanging out on a line to dry and about a quarter mile away after climbing down about a 100-foot-high steel ladder. I climb down carefully but rapidly then sprint back to camp (amazing how light and powerful it feels to walk and run when you don’t have a fully loaded backpack on your back!) and get everything rescued before the rain starts in earnest. Amazingly, it stops almost as quickly as it begins, and it appears the two storms I had been watching before joining up and approaching the fire tower, actually separated and went around the top of the mountain as I can see an orange glowing sunset in the west as the rain stops and the winds kicks back up a notch.

The next day I start early and head south intending to make a shelter just north of the MA/VT state line. Southern Vermont has rolling open hills at this point although there are several deep notches through which roads and the trail have to cross. About mid-morning I am aware of a hiker headed northbound towards me and have to blink a couple of times as I think I’m seeing things but no, it actually is the first Nudist hiker I’ve ever encountered on the Appalachian Trail (or any trail for that matter…). He appears to be about late 60’s or early 70’s, graying and let’s just say doesn’t appear to be “Chippendale” material. In any case, the AT is a “Sure, Whatever” kind of experience and we exchange a quick “uhm, Hi?” greeting before hiking on our separate ways. About a quarter mile further South I meet a family sitting on a rock eating a snack, laughing and having to explain to their 10 year old son what just happened. I was still pondering the horrendous mosquito bites I was sporting all over me and wondering how this guy was making out with the Vampires of the forest…

I made camp just as darkness fell and saw it had been a very good 22 mile day but after setting up the tent realized the water supply for this particular shelter is another half mile away each way so ended up pretty tired and ate quickly and crashed into the sleeping bag by 7:30.

The next day was intentionally a short 7 miles to cross the border and into Massachusetts and when I got to the road crossing would have a 2 mile walk to the nearest Motel and store to resupply. Very near the border I was coming down a steep and mossy incline and I was thinking about what specifically I needed to get at resupply as well as where to find some good food for a “town dinner” and my feet slipped out from the mossy wet rock dropping me hard onto my elbow and hip for about a 8 foot slip down a smooth but hard rock face. I picked myself up, wiped mud off my legs and butt and kept plodding along. Falls have become less frequent but interesting feel less damaging to my body as I just sort of bounce back up and have learned to fall a little like in Judo. 
When I arrive at the road crossing, I notice a hiker getting out of a car and ask quickly if the driver is going back towards where the hotel is and in fact he is the owner of the motel so I jump in and avoid the dreaded two mile road walk. As I check into the motel, another hiker I’ve been crossing paths with while southbound “El Gringo Loco” is there and he immediately points out “what happened to your elbow” which I then see is split open and still bleeding two hours after the fall. I clean it up in the shower and get laundry done before heading into town for some antibiotic and gauze bandages. 
It feels great to have arrived in Massachusetts where I’ve lived most of my life but interesting enough is a state that I’ve never hiked one step of the AT in! My plan is to rest up one night in North Adams, resupply and then continue south to Great Barrington MA on the Connecticut border where I’ll rent a car and drive two hours east to Gloucester MA to meet my wife Kim and spend a whole week off-trail visiting before she leaves for a long trip to Italy and my return to finish up the AT.","Killington VT

North Adams MA to Great Barrington, MA  - 72 Miles

After the included breakfast at the motel, El Gringo Loco and I caught a ride from the owner back to the trail head and started out together. We had met a couple times up in Vermont and decided we’d at least start the day off together although as always with thru hikers, “hike your own hike” meaning, we’d have different paces, destinations and timetables. Immediately hiking out of North Adams/ Williamstown, the AT tackles the very steep climb up the highest Mountain in Massachusetts, Mt Greylock. It has a road to the top and I recall having driven up there with my parents as a boy but had no real recall of what it was like up there. The north side of Greylock is steep and gravelly with a couple of interesting viewpoints out over the Williamstown valley I’d just hiked from. It started out as a warm sunny morning and I was sweating profusely by the time I hiked to the top of 3500-foot Mt Greylock. But it also was humid, and the air was heavy with the promise of afternoon rains. I planned a long day and to stealth camp somewhere along the trail but as I was leaving the open summit it started to thunderstorm and pour so heavily, the trail actually flooded and I was soon hiking in a 6 inch deep gulley of water headed down into Dalton MA. At one point, I glanced up from under my baseball cap which had a waterfall spilling off of it to see a 20 foot boulder just off the trail with a 5 foot high overhang and the promise of refuge so I ducked into cover for about 30 minutes but went from hot and steamy hiking to soaking wet and chilled to the bone as the temperatures dropped drastically in the crackling thunderstorm overhead.

Eventually it tapered off but by then, my pack and my tent which is strapped to the outside of the pack were soaked and I decided to push on till dark but to try to make a town where I knew there was a hiker hostel with a reasonable price and an opportunity to once again explode the pack and dry everything out. I walked the rest of the day and into Dalton where the AT continues on the roads thru town for about 4 miles. That was a long, wet trudge at the end of a long day but in the end checked in and dried everything out before getting a hot dinner and to sleep in a dry bed. My total distance that day was 24 miles in very challenging circumstances.

The next day was a planned easy day of only 11.5 miles as I wanted to specifically stop at October Mountain in MA as my wife Kim’s family had a great aunt Genny, who many years ago was famous on the AT for her farm which the AT passed thru and she had a “Open barn” policy for hikers and helped many of the early AT through hikers with food and other assistance. She lived on October Mt in Massachusetts although the trail has since been rerouted away from the property a long time ago and she passed away many years ago, she is immortalized in the National Geographic pictorial book “The Appalachian Trail”. In some sense just walking the area felt a little like exploring my wife’s family history. In this area, there are also many bear and I met up with a trail maintenance volunteer that had just had a close run in with a black bear on the same stretch of trail I had walked 30 minutes earlier. I also noticed a distinct increase in the mosquito population in MA which normally would not be the case as it was getting later into September which in New England usually is bug free. However, the extremely wet summer and fall had re-hatched bumper crops of the blood thirsty vampires. I usually hike with a small bottle of DEET for severe mosquito situations but had actually run out in southern Vermont and could not find bug spray of any kind in any of the towns I passed through as everyone was Sold Out! I ended up having put on my full rain-pants and rain jacket with hood pulled tightly around my face in sweltering conditions to prevent further bites and welts. I got some strange looks by other hikers and in town when crossing roads to be bundled up like a monsoon was blowing when there was no rain or snow just a cloud of bugs.

I also made a plan for the next day to be another short day for the opportunity to stay at the AMC Upper Goose Pond cabin. This is a free facility in the Berkshire that sits on a pristine lake with ancient summer cottages around it that is famous on the AT. The volunteer caretakers of the property also are known for extensive large breakfasts for donations and anything at this point that I didn’t have to cook for myself was a bonus. I hiked only a 9-mile day from October Mt and arrived mid afternoon and set up my tent on a tent platform near the pond. Upon checking in with the caretaker, he informed me that not only were they serving breakfast for the AT hikers the next morning, they had a large spaghetti feast planned that evening as well for donations only, which I agreed to join. There were 8 hikers and two AMC care-takers and we easily polished off 4 pounds of pasta, a large pot of Italian sausages in Tomato sauce, chicken breasts, 3 loaves of Italian bread, 2 buckets of salad and 2 pans of brownies. Awesome! The next days breakfast of Pancakes, Bacon and coffee cake washed down by multiple cups of coffee was an excellent start to the day.

The next day I started again with El Gringo Loco and we had a common destination of a shelter just outside of Great Barrington, MA where we both needed to resupply and was the next town stop along the way. About mid-day, El Gringo had gotten ahead of me and climbed to the top of a ridge where we planned lunch but as I was hiking up the trail near an ancient abandoned Shaker Village, I looked up and saw a large Black Bear about 50 feet from me just at the side of the trail. The Bear was ripping apart a rotted log digging for bugs or worms in it and spotted me about the same time I saw it. It stood on its hind legs, sniffed the air like “What the heck… it’s a human!” and then took off at a full run up the hill much faster than I would have thought possible.

I waited a couple of minutes, letting my heart slow down and then continued to the top where I found Gringo with his boots off, lying down eating lunch. He’d been wanting to see bears and when I announced I’d just seen one and which direction it went in, he laced up his boots and started to track the bear down! I continued on and later that day at the shelter, he was able to show me a video of not just the one bear but three that were on the same hillside with us but just weren’t aware of. This amazed us that we saw this in Massachusetts while neither of us had seen any in Maine, New Hampshire or Vermont!

The next morning we woke to another day of drizzle and set out the final 6.5 miles down into the town of Great Barrington where I’d arranged a shuttle ride from the trailhead to a motel for Gringo and then into the bigger town of Pittsfield for me where I would rent a car and drive into Boston to meet Kim at the airport. 
I missed my wife greatly and had last seen each other in the middle of Maine in July when she drove up to Sugarloaf Mt to be with me for a couple of days. She was enroute from Boston to Italy the following week to tour with good friends and visit with friends of the family so I took an entire week off the trail at this point to rest up, resupply, buy my third and final pair of hiking boots at REI (They wear out really fast when you’re hiking in them day in and day out). I also started trying to pack some weight back on my body as I’d burned off many pounds of weight during the 4 months of strenuous hiking and limited calories possible when backpacking. My “street clothes” hung on me and I had to cinch up pants tightly with a belt to keep them from falling off my hips.","North Adams MA

Great Barrington, MA   to Wingdale NY- 72 Miles

 

After dropping my wife Kim at Logan International Airport in Boston, I reversed my steps and drove the rental car back out west to the Berkshires and arranged a shuttle from the Pittsfield MA car Rental Return back to the trailhead in Great Barrington. It had been a great week spent together, resting, eating great food, catching up on how each other was doing with this extended separation. Even though we talk almost every night on the trail, it is difficult on a relationship to be apart for such a long time. I so much appreciate Kim’s support of my dream of hiking the AT and her patience with me as this is a LONG time to be away. I was also a little jealous of her upcoming 2-week trip to Europe as we really enjoy travelling together and Italy is one of our favorite countries to visit. It was very tempting to “defer” getting back on the trail and go with her, but I need to finish and frankly if I took 3 weeks off now, may never get back to finish it this year.

I started back on the trail around 3 PM and had about 3 hours to get to my planned destination that night. But first the shuttle driver warned me that the next couple of miles beyond where he dropped me were low, wet and nicknamed “Mosquito Alley” for a good reason. My welts on my legs and arms had just about gone away in the week sleeping inside so I was ready to donate blood again. I also had replenished my DEET and doused my exposed skin before walking into the woods. Thankfully, the trail climbed a low ridge called “The Jug Handle” after about 3 miles and continued on top of the ridgeline where a breeze was blowing, and cooler temperatures reminded me fall in New England waits for no one. 
I hiked to a shelter called the Hemlocks that I intended to set up my tent near and then get an early start the next morning when I will cross into Connecticut. Walking in by headlamp revealed very rocky and steep terrain all around the shelter and only one other hiker there eating his dinner so I decide to sleep in the shelter. As described earlier in my blog, I dislike sleeping in the shelters due to exposure to snoring hikers, mice trying to get into my food, snakes trying to eat the mice at night, hard surfaces to lie on, etc but sometimes you just have to make the best of it.

I made a light dinner of soup and trail mix by flashlight and asked about the other hiker’s story. His trail name was “Tag-a-long” and he appeared to not have much experience in backpacking and his equipment seemed new and barely used. He also was a heavy smoker which is rare for a true hiker. It turns out, he decided on a spur of the moment (and after losing his job and his girlfriend…) to join an old friend who was southbound thru-hiking the AT and they met up in southern Vermont. The friend obviously already had his trail legs built up and the first day out planned 17 miles which about killed Tag-a-long so they agreed to part ways on day 2. I asked how many miles he’d walked that day and he said “0” and had spent the whole day laying around the campsite napping and smoking. I soon realized there was no way he would ever finish the trail and wasn’t motivated at all. I also realized that after a week of not hiking 20 miles a day, I hadn’t much hunger nor was I ready to crash at 8 pm, typically my “hiker’s mid-night”. I did eventually fall asleep but was awakened during the night by the unmistakable sound of an animal scratching at my backpack which was hanging on the wall of the shelter near my head. When I clicked on my headlamp, there were 3 mice crawling over the backpack trying to eat thru the material to get at crumbs, my sweat, whatever. I took a trekking pole and whacked the backpack so hard they went flying out the front of the shelter into the dirt. Sorry PETA! 
The next morning, I awoke before dawn, made a quick breakfast, packed up and started on the trail by headlamp. There was no sign of Tag-a-long stirring or getting ready for the days hike as I left. I guessed it was to be another “0” and I never saw him again on the trail. 
The AT continued about 5 miles along the ridgeline before dropping into a deep valley which had a massive and fast flowing river coming down a mile-long box canyon with steep walls on three sides. The other side of the river was Connecticut and the start of the next state southbound. I had to jump stone to stone to cross the river and managed to get splashed on my new boots I’d just purchased but they seemed to be holding up well. I pushed on and stopped for lunch and to dry out my boots on top of Bear Mt. CT which is the highest point in the state (and not nearly as high as the highest point in MA). My destination that day was about 17 miles and through a couple of northern Connecticut towns. I was surprised though as the ridgeline and mountain tops in Connecticut are rockier and steeper than I had imagined. Since the AT follows the ridgeline of the Appalachian Mt range from Maine to GA, I guess it makes sense the same rocks and terrain would extend state to state.

I hiked a total of 17 miles that day to a remote shelter called Limestone Spring. It was the only source of good drinking water in about a 15 mile stretch of trail and the guidebook warned that the shelter was far off the AT and half a mile down a steep, treacherous trail to the water source. This proved to be true and though it was far off the trail, the real pain was to be the next morning climbing back up the trail to rejoin the AT. I arrived at dusk and set up my tent on a tent platform as the ground here was very muddy and rutted. I was the only hiker there when I climbed into the tent after dinner to go to sleep and I reflected on the fact that the further I got south on the trail, it seemed like the less people I was seeing. Northbound hikers at this point simply couldn’t make it to Mt Katahdin in time for the October closing and the few south-bounders I met where either slower hikers than I or dropped out along the way.

I woke at about 10:30 though to a flashlight lighting up my tent and shining around my campsite. I hadn’t heard any voices or even footsteps like I sometimes wake up to at night along the trail. I peered out of the tent window trying to see what this other person is doing arriving so late and am puzzled as they walked about 100 feet away from my tent in a complete circle and then into the woods, then back towards my tent. Eventually the light disappeared, or I simply got too drowsy to watch it anymore and went back to sleep.

In the morning I followed my same routine of starting in the dark although I went light on breakfast as I intended to stop mid-morning for a breakfast in town at a café that is somewhat famous on the AT called Toymakers Café. It probably was a 6-mile hike to get there but the breakfast was amazing with a giant Omelet, 2 orders of crispy bacon, 4 slices of Whole wheat toast and lots of coffee. As I was leaving, I noticed a sign offering a 2-for-1 Dove ice cream bar deal which appealed to me, so I had 2 ice cream bars for breakfast desert! Awesome.

During the afternoon I overtook another AT Southbound hiker named K-bar and we chatted about the usual things like start dates, destinations, interesting stories. He then admitted to being the late arriving hiker the previous night and explained he had some trouble locating the shelter where he was planning to stay and had slept in after such a late arrival but must have passed by me when I got off the trail to walk into town for my extended breakfast at the Toymakers. The two of us leapfrogged the next couple of hundred miles southbound into Pennsylvania and got to know each other’s story well.

The following day was the last day in Connecticut and I entered New York, increasing my excitement at making quick progress southbound. Before leaving Connecticut though, the AT follows along the Housatonic  river for approximately 10 miles and the trail is flat, wide and soft under foot. As often occurs though, the AT detours from the easy if there are geographic points of interest and at one the point the trail diverts to climb steeply St Johns Ledges which would have been really tough to climb down Northbound if the weather had been poor but it was a nice day and southbound it was really just a steep 500 foot rock scramble and that terrain is what I love to climb and my legs are in tip-top shape. About half way up I came across a REI Rock climbing class all roped in and practicing rappelling down the rock face… which I was climbing up at a brisk pace with a 20 pound backpack. I chuckled to myself as the class stopped talking and everyone turned to watch me scramble up past them unprotected by ropes. “Have a good day!”

I tented that night at Mt Algo shelter in New York. There recently have been reports of bears raiding the hiker’s food here and I’m on high alert as I’m the only hiker in the remote area as I set up camp and hang up the food-bag after dinner. I saw no bears but again as dusk was setting in, K-bar arrived after having stopped at town to resupply and do laundry and again choose to sleep in the shelter while I preferred a flat tent spot a hundred yards away. This is very typical that AT hikers set their own schedule and itinerary based on need to resupply, general weariness and the weather.

 I also needed to plan a resupply soon as meals were running out and it had been 5 nights since I’d slept in a bed, showered, done laundry etc., so I planned a town stop for the next night in Wingdale NY and booked a cheap motel near a general store and restaurant that was known to be “hiker friendly”. The trail that day was about 18 miles and climbed and descended many smaller ridges going through rural New York. I tried hitch hiking the 5 miles into town with no success and ultimately had to call a taxi to come and get me. 
The Duchess motel turned out to be “dirt-bag” cheap lodging meaning you get what you pay for. In this case though it also was the only place in town so it had to do. The owner allows hikers to do their own laundry in their commercial machines in the back of the motel for free and so I stripped down and put on my rain jacket and a pair of running shorts while everything else got washed and dried. I met a couple of Northbound hikers here who were laid up for a couple days recuperation from injuries and general weariness. They also seemed dejected as they knew they couldn’t possible finish the northbound hike in time, so they weren’t in any hurry anymore. “Hike your own hike” in this case also means not giving advice or correction if it isn’t asked for and it wasn’t.","Great Barrrington MA

Wingdale NY to Delaware Water Gap PA - 148 Miles

After catching an Uber ride back to the Wingdale trail head, I crossed the railroad where the famous AT railroad station is. It is possible to catch a train from here into NY on the Metro North line and many hikers do just that as a break from the trail, but sightseeing was not on my agenda at this point. I felt both anxious to finish with the New York and New Jersey sections of the trail but also was feeling a certain lethargy after hiking four months and approximately 1800 miles. This section is not particularly difficult nor steep but true to form, follows the rocky crest of the Appalachian Mountain range and much of the days are spent with short climbs up and down slippery slab rock ridges and valleys.

There are a couple of key stops in this section that every AT hiker wants to experience and the first night back on the trail, I stopped at RPH shelter which was only a 12.5-mile day, but it is famous for being a nice cabin with bunks, solar showers and the ability to order food delivery from town! There appears to be a choice between pizza, Italian or Chinese food delivery and I opted for a Chinese feast delivered to the road about 100 feet from the shelter. I wolfed the meal having anticipated it and desiring calories and fat more than anything healthy. The shelter was completely filled with through hikers and one hiker from NYC who literally was just starting on the trail and eagerly soaking up the accumulated knowledge. It started to rain just after dark and proceeded to pour overnight. In the morning looking out the door it was as if the cabin was in the middle of a swampy lake and from the first steps, my boots were soaked to the ankles.

Many of the previous night’s hikers decided to zero at RPH given it was supposed to rain hard and thunderstorm all day but I have the philosophy that this is a good opportunity to both shower and do laundry at the same time so I headed 20 miles south towards the Hudson River crossing which is a bit of a milestone for both NOBO and SOBO AT hikers. I slogged through the rain all day long with no stops and often just walking through streams that had overflowed their banks and turning the trail into a flowing streambed itself. My baseball cap is a lifesaver, keeping the rain from my eyes but it is like looking out of a waterfall in front of my eyes. I heard Lightning strikes in the distance and I knew I had an exposed section of the trail on Bear Mt coming up late in the day, so I opted to break at 6 PM as it was getting dark and called an Uber from a road crossing to overnight in a hotel nearby. After an all-day soaking and thunderstorms, the temperature dropped with the oncoming darkness and I began to shiver uncontrollably when I stopped. I realized this could have been serious hypothermia if I wasn’t headed to sleep inside that night. Thankfully I was successful drying everything out and rested up for the next few days push southward. 
The next day was clear and beautiful for the crossing of the Hudson river on a long bridge walk and then a significant climb up Bear Mt. This section of the AT is designed as an educational exhibit of how the Appalachian trail is designed and constructed with well laid out and explained exhibits of trail architecture including how trail crews move huge rocks weighing hundreds of pounds. Also, Interesting enough, I learned it wasn’t called Bear Mt due to animals but in the early days, English explorers found it to be a “Bare” top mountain due to rocky soil and fires burning off the forest and over the years, it morphed from Bare Mt to “Bear” Mt. 
Much of the trail here is through state parks and forests and very rocky. The AT guide I use has many warnings of Rattlesnakes in this section and I walk carefully but between the recent washout conditions and onset of colder weather driving the reptiles deeper into the rocks, I didn’t see any. At one point though I come across a five-foot black snake that has clearly eaten some kind of a big rodent and is stretched out straight across the trail. I first think it is dead but when I nudge it with my muddy boot it stirs slightly and a beady eye glares up at me with a characteristic NY style “ WHAT??”. 
I planned on other hiker’s strong recommendations to make a short detour off the trail to a famous Ice Cream store called the Belville Creamery on a NY dairy farm. Its only the middle of the day but the lines are 10-deep so I drop my smelly pack outside and queue up with my stomach growling out loud. I can feel people’s eyes on me as I’ve been slogging through really nasty weather and haven’t shaved in a month and must look homeless and starving. Upon reaching the counter, I order the largest banana split they have “loaded” and then the manager comes out from behind the counter with a huge AT logbook asking me to sign in as they are “hiker friendly” meaning they won’t run you off just because you’re sweaty and stink! The 1000 calorie treat hits the spot and only takes minutes to devour but by this point, I’m burning 6000 – 7000 calories a day and my worn and dirty hiking shorts are loose and falling off my hips. I seriously contemplate a second ice cream but decide that probably wouldn’t be the best for the digestive system at this point in the day so head back on the trail headed for Wawayanda State park which is another 10 miles ahead and set up my tent and stretch out for an afternoon nap before dinner.

The hiker known as K-Bar comes into camp about dusk and we caught up on each other’s journey. He came down sick at the RPH shelter several days back and needed to get some medical attention but was back on the trail the next day and caught up after a few days. We agreed to hike together the next section and help to motivate each other, and we turned in a series of 18 to 21-mile days to push towards Pennsylvania. 
We walked into Uniondale NY at the end of one day to buy resupplies at a small town market and then stopped 2 miles later at another iconic shelter on the AT called the “Secret Shelter” although its clearly marked on maps and guidebooks, it is actually a private enclosed cabin on a pretty farm about a quarter mile off the trail and was built by a former through hiker who wanted to help out other AT hikers. The farm had electric wells for water and outlets for charging up phones and GPS units. It was beautiful and sitting on the rough front porch of the cabin cooking dinner at dusk we spotted some deer up in the field about 100 yards above us and then we noticed an eastern Bobcat slinking through the grass trying to get close enough to attack the deer. I’ve seen this type of Cat hunt in Africa on Safari but really didn’t think it possible in the US. Sure enough, the deer were aware of the big cat sneaking closer and kept moving further out of his range like the proverbial cat and mouse. After that, we slept with the door closed knowing there was big cat nearby!

On one of the longer days, we again had heavy weather forecasted and try to push hard to get off the exposed rocky NJ mountain peaks and camp down at the AMC Mohican center where there are bunkrooms and kitchens. Because K-Bar and I hike separately and arrive at different times in the middle of heavy thunderstorms and our cell phones giving off emergency tornado warnings, we end up in different bunkhouses. We are the only two hikers at this entire AMC facility and its eeriy sleeping in a deserted 20-person bunkhouse with no one else there while a storm is howling outside. As this is early October now, I have visions of this place on Halloween. Spooky!

The next day we start off again in soaking trail conditions and can’t avoid slogging through ankle deep water. The destination that night is to cross into Pennsylvania at the Delaware Water Gap and only have an 11-mile day so decide to stop and eat a lunch in town and to overnight at a cheap motel in Stroudsburg PA so we can resupply and do laundry to dry out our gear. 
Delaware Water Gap is another long bridge crossing and after having walked out of the quiet woods, it is noisy and breezy. I hold my baseball cap on as trucks and cars blast by at 60 MPH just feet away. The NJ/PA stateline is in the middle of the bridge and is cheerily painted on the sidewalk to inform AT hikers they’ve arrived. In my case as a SOBO, it means I only have two more states (PA and MD) to get back to my mid-way point, Harpers Ferry WV.","Wingdale, NY

Delaware Water Gap PA to Duncannon PA - 147 Miles

 

Entering Pennsylvania was both a boost to my morale as the end of my 2200 mile trek got closer, but it also brought some dread as PA has a hikers reputation as being extremely rocky and dangerous. The truth was that since High Point State Park in NJ, two days prior I’d noticed the trail getting progressively more difficult and hard on my feet and slowing me down. The difficulty comes more from the teetering, unstable and sharp rocks that the trail crosses over, sometimes for miles without a break. It’s as if someone in sadistic pleasure rearranged all rocks from baseball size to bicycle size so they stood haphazardly on end with no flat surface to place your feet, all with very sharp edges and awkward spacing in between the rocks where if you placed your feet or legs in there, can’t see what lives in between. 
Getting started out of Delaware Water Gap together with K-Bar, we climbed steeply out of the valley and onto a long flat ridge and followed it for several days spending nights tenting near reliable water supplies which often were located close to shelters or cabins. Much of PA has been mined and the water sources are known to be somewhat questionable. Even though I filter all my water, yellow or brownish water from streams makes you question what was dumped upstream or left over from strip mining operations. K-Bar had as a goal to reach the trail town of Duncannon PA and then he was done with his trip that had been broken up over two years due to several injuries. From the Delaware Water gap, it was only about 150 miles and when we crossed 100 miles to go he was very upbeat. However, the sharp rocks in PA were torture for him and he frequently mentioned severe pain in his feet although we were progressing 17 – 21 miles per day at this point over a twelve-hour hiking day. 
The weather started to turn on us again providing a string of wet, cool, windy days. The rocks in PA then took on a slippery green old Moss sheen to them and we both took several slips and falls per day. Bangs, bruises and cuts multiplied over my legs and arms as I tried desperately to not get seriously hurt this late in the trip. I personally know one of the very strong through hikers that I’d started NOBO with in Georgia in March had made it as far north as the Pennsylvania rocks before taking a bad slip and twist of the knee that caused him to hobble for 3 days before needing to seek medical attention in town only to be told that in fact the twist injury was really a broken leg that he’d been walking on... for three days! That brought his trip to an end for this year and I certainly hope he gets back on the trail next year to complete the trail.

On our third night out of Delaware Water Gap, we opted to sleep in a shelter as the ground was soaked and our tents, packs and boots were drenched from heavy all-day rains. I was aware that K-bar was in agony and awake a good part of the night as he moved around a lot. I woke at 6 am as I did every morning to quickly get breakfast, get packed up and on the trail by dawn at 7 am. K-bar immediately announced that he had made the decision to drop off the trail and had in fact called his wife in North Carolina at 4 am to come get him that day as he couldn’t take the foot pain anymore. I was dumbfounded as there were only about 80 miles left for him to complete and I couldn’t imagine giving up so close to the finish line. I asked if he shouldn’t rather take a rest day here or go see a doctor in town and then decide, but he stated the decision was made and his wife was on the road to pick him up. We still had a rugged 7 miles over the rocks to get out to the nearest road crossing where he could get back to civilization and we walked it mostly silent and apart. I always knew that HYOH (Hike your own hike) applies no matter what happens, and I had made the decision to push on and complete my trek no matter what. I had only about 250 miles left but a lot to focus on to get there.

I headed into Port Clinton that night making a long 23-mile day out of it and booked a motel nearby thinking I need to dry out my gear, resupply and rest up for the rest of my journey. The AT as it enters Port Clinton, which is an old industrialized PA city, follows a littered railroad track and dirty smelling river for the last mile into town where I would catch my ride and it passes through the only hobo town I saw on the entire track. I wasn’t afraid for my safety but the homeless men sitting around in the dusk, drinking out of bottles in paper bags eyed me and my pack warily and I marched confidently past them even though my legs were tired, and I really needed to be done for the day. I couldn’t help thinking about possibly what happened in their life that had them living outside by necessity and not by choice as I was doing for 5 and a half months. An Uber ride later, a hot shower and a hot meal made a load of difference in my legs and my attitude that night.

In reviewing the guide book, I noticed a couple of recommended hiker hostels coming up in the next several days, so I decided to stop at them to save from setting up camp in the continuing rain. I also arranged a 23-mile slack pack from the Rock and Soul hostel which turned out to be a smart idea. The owner lent me a light daypack and took me ahead, so I could hike northward back towards the hostel. The day of the slack pack had me crossing the rockiest parts of the path so far and over a section of trail known as “the snake farm”. It has been reported multiple times that if you look in between these sharp slippery rocks you will see poisonous Rattlesnakes and Copperheads co-existing, waiting for something tasty to slip into their den… like a hiker’s ankle!  I was lucky on several counts as it was raining, it was cold and I was hiking with a small light pack instead of my 20-pound full backpack. I never saw any poisonous snakes and I was able to maintain my footing on the slippery rock with no extra weight trying to pull me down. Rock and Soul is also known for amazing meals prepared by the owner and his wife and they feed you on their beautiful porch with music playing softly and their Labrador retriever curled up at your feet. It was well worth the stop and among the best hiker hostels I visited.

In this section of trail, I also crossed a beaver dam swamp that over the years has flooded out the Appalachian trail. There is no way around or over it, so the hikers must remove shoes and slog about 150 yards through knee deep smelly swamp water. The beavers are still active here and if you try to pull apart their dam, they will swim out and repair it before the hour is out. The hostel owner explained the local AT trail committee was going to re-locate the trail, but it wouldn’t be done for another year so “suck it up, buttercup!”. 
At this point in the hike, I was averaging 22 and 23-mile days and felt absolutely at the peak of hiking fitness. The routine of waking early, packing up in the dark, hiking steady all day and setting up camp by headlamp became standard and comfortable. One night I arrived to Peters Mountain Shelter as the dark was settling in and knew I’d been without water since almost noon time due to the questionable streams and springs in this section. There is a good water source at Peters Mountain, but it is a solid half mile down a steep, twisting staircase that has been described by some as similar to the hidden staircase into Mordor in the Lord of Rings movies. I quickly dropped my pack in the shelter, gathered my collapsible water-bags and bottles and grabbed a headlamp and headed directly down the stairs in the dark. It was apparent it was more like a half mile ladder than a staircase as one slip would have been disastrous. I had been the only hiker above at the hut which made the descent even weirder and horror film like. Eventually I could hear water splashing far below me in the dark and when completing the climb down was rewarded with a large 3-inch pipe sticking out of a rock walled spring absolutely gushing cold clear water. Since I didn’t want to have to climb back down here again the next day before hiking, I loaded up a total of 4 liters of water or almost 9 pounds of weight and started to climb back up the steep, dark staircase. About half way up I almost ran into another young hiker in the dark who unknown to me had arrived at the shelter after I did and also made the trek down to the water source, but his flashlight batteries had died out the night before and he needed to resupply the next day in town.  Since he had no light, the only advice I could give him was to listen for the splash of the water. By the time the young hiker had climbed down and back up I had already cooked my dinner of Ramen noodles and laid out my sleeping bag ready to crash after a 23-mile day.

The following morning, I completed the 12-mile trek into Duncannon PA after another wide river crossing on a bridge. It felt surreal that here I was a few days after K-bar had to drop out to be finishing the section he would have needed to complete his hike. I celebrated the completion of this milestone with the famous greasy cheeseburger at the Doyle Hotel bar and grill. I opted to not stay at the notoriously old and dirty hostel but instead to stay outside of town in a more modern motel that also provided a ride both ways for me. Since leaving Delaware Water Gap, I had completed over half of the remaining distance to my finish point of Harpers Ferry WV and I was eager to get started the next day and into the next section of Pennsylvania landscape.","Delaware Water Gap PA

Duncannon PA to Harpers Ferry WV - Finished! – 123 Miles

Catching a ride back into Duncannon in the morning and picking up where I left off the previous afternoon, I walk about a mile on abandoned and chilly streets to the outskirts of town where the Appalachian trail re-enters the woods and climbs steeply back to the Pennsylvania ridge line and headed south. I’m excited as the next section of trail transitions from the rocky and treacherous “Rocksylvania” to the rolling Pennsylvania Dutch farmlands. However, the first half of the day felt every bit as rocky and hard as the previous seven, but I knew it would be ending soon. I make good time on the relatively flat ridge before descending and soon am crossing open grasslands and cornfields. I knew I’m about 6 nights away from finishing but the unknowns of terrain, weather and my physical stamina are factors, but I want to average well above 20 miles a day till I’m done.

 This section winds through many of Pennsylvania’s state parks and the trail is pleasant and softer underfoot. This section is the theoretical half-way point for the entire 2200-mile AT and near it is the Pine Grove General store best known for their Ice Cream Half Gallon challenge. Believe me I could easily do this, eating a half gallon in one sitting with my ever present “hiker hunger”, but my timing is such that I’m walking right past the dark and quiet store at 8:30 am on a Saturday morning but they don’t open until 11 am so will have to pass it up. I do however decide to push to a hiker hostel that night known as the House of Hope which is run by a church… of sorts. It’s a long 24.5-mile day to the road crossing and then a full mile walk on a busy road in the rain to check-in and get my bunk assigned. I had expected to be in a shared bunkroom with other hikers but the guy checking me in said “There’s a private bedroom available if you’d like!”. Perfect for a good night’s sleep and I pull everything out of the pack for one last drying, cleaning and re-organizing. I know I’ll be crossing into Maryland soon and once on the trail intend to push as quickly as possible through the state. I’ve heard people say it’s an easy walk and some hikers are able to do the entire state in one day.

In the morning, I head out in the dark having to walk the mile back on the busy road, so I wear my headlamp until I’m safely off the road and into the woods. The trail climbs back to the peak of the ridge but starts to thread its way along and through gigantic slab boulders that make up the ridgeline. When I cross over the Pennsylvania line into Maryland (The Mason Dixon Line) the trail then climbs through what’s known as the Devils racecourse. This is like a gigantic mouse maze of broken rocks and cliffs that the trail threads through. In some places, the White blazes of the AT disappeared, and I needed to bushwhack my trail up the mountain using my GPS and a map. I had a shelter in mind called Ravens Rock as my destination that night but climbing through the rocks really slowed me down and darkness was starting to set in. I resolved to just find a flat spot to set up my tent when I climbed through the labyrinth but the terrain on top was more of the jumbled boulders with no good flat open campsites. I pushed on under headlamp and walked into the shelter about 7:30 pm after a 23-mile day (plus the one-mile road walk that doesn’t “count” for anything but sore feet!). I was really surprised that there was no one else at the shelter as I made dinner and laid out my sleeping bag. I was sound asleep when I woke to shouting at about 12 midnight from the general direction of the trail. Unbelievably, two hikers, a father and a son stumbled in at midnight and admitted they’d gotten lost in the maze too and once out had been disoriented as to which way the shelter was. They definitely weren’t AT through hikers nor even very experienced outdoorsman based on the hooting and hollering. I asked where they’d started since, I hadn’t seen them at all during my long day and they admitted to a late afternoon start, thinking they could easily cover a relatively short 10 miles to the shelter but hadn’t counted on getting lost. In any case, I fell back asleep in about 30 seconds after talking to them knowing I still was getting up in five and a half hours and would NOT be quiet in making my breakfast or packing up! Sure enough, they never stirred when I broke camp and headed out as the sun was starting to lighten the eastern horizon. 
The trail in Maryland ran true to form the whole way to the border. I had one last night before finishing at Harpers Ferry and I headed to the Rocky Run Shelter in Md for my final night. I knew (and really didn’t care) that my stove fuel and food supplies were dwindling down. If my planning held out, I’d end with almost no food and that would simplify my end of trip logistics. I made the 21 miles in great time arriving well before dark and saw the shelter was an identical copy of the two story shelter I’d stayed in the previous night. It also was brand new and was located about 300 yards away from the old Rocky Run shelter which is also where the water source was located. After setting up camp, again as the only person here, I headed to the spring to fill up and when there noticed there were two “transients” living in the old shelter. They had a grab bag of abandoned camping equipment, rickety lawn chairs, clothing hanging near the spring they had recently washed in. I said “hello” but they were really suspicious of me and said “they never saw anyone out here” which gave me a bad vibe. I resolved to keep an eye out on these characters and actually hoped for someone else to come along to help “be on watch”. In addition, as I started to cook dinner, my stove fuel cannister emptied and I ended up with a cold supper and a cold breakfast for the morning. From 300 yards away, I could hear they were drinking and then singing getting louder and louder. It really wasn’t a very restful night as I laid awake “on guard” but the other two stayed their distance and fell asleep again about mid-night. I laughed to myself that these late nights were getting to me and in real contrast to the more typical 7:30 or 8 pm nights I was used to on the trail. 
My final morning, I woke with anticipation of “getting it done” and packed up quickly and efficiently knowing there were no more nights of camping ahead. The final day was “only” 15 and a half miles along the ridge line and then a very steep descent to the Potomac River and a long flat walk to the railroad bridge that crosses the river into West Virginia. I had enough protein bars and trail mix to sustain me for breakfast and decided to walk it non-stop. I called my wife Kim by cellphone as I crossed the bridge and the final few steps we were able to take “together” after all her support and encouragement along the way. I have to admit being very emotional and excited to have completed this trek that I had set out on so many months before. 
This hike was everything I knew and wanted it to be and yet still it was full of unexpected surprises. Hiking day-in and day-out  for a distance of 2190 miles is a life accomplishment and along the way, I met incredible people, saw amazing things in nature, heard fantastic stories, experienced all types of weather, observed all kinds of animals and reptiles, took about 5,000,000 steps, burned through three pairs of hiking boots, dropped 30 pounds down to 150 (I weighed 155 in high school so this was a pretty thin version of me). 
Crossing into historic Harpers Ferry technically was “the end’ for me but symbolically I wanted the finish to be at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters in town so I walked the half mile up to their building where I had checked in after the northbound first half and got photographed (again) and signed in (again) but then the management staff and volunteers at the ATC came into the “Hikers lounge” where I was sipping on a Gatorade and they gave me a standing ovation which really felt fantastic. Maybe in some small way, having one old, dirty through hiker in their midst completing the trail was what made their work supporting the AT all worthwhile. At least I like to think so.","Duncannon PA
