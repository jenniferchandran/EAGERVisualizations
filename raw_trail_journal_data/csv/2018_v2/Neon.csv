Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581114,"The next hiking season looms and I'm happy to greet it.  For a few weeks it seemed like my buddy David would be joining me.  :He was my very first hiking buddy.  That was about 45 years ago.  We decided to take on the Long Trail in VT.  Back then hiking was a blue-jeans and external frame pack deal, with a full array of cook pots and heavy sleeping bags.  I think my pack, a nice JanSport number with articulating hip 'wings', must have weighed at least 40 pounds when full.  I made dog packs for our two dogs as well so the animals could carry their own food.  We set out NOBO on May 1, which was, we discovered, a bit early for the LT.  Our fate was sealed by that choice.  On the way to the first shelter the dogs had such a great time racing through the woods that their packs ripped open.  Dog food gone.  The next day we encountered snow.  Deep snow.  I was walking behind David and at one point he fell through the snow crust so that all I could see was his backpack, sitting on the snow, his head on top and his arms helicoptering vainly.  That mental image is permanent.  We froze that night.  The next day we bailed, heading overland downhill towards where we thought civilization might be.  We did pop out into Rt. 2 in N. Adams, just in time to see an Oscar Meyer Weiner vehicle drive by.  You know those - literally a hot-dog-on-wheels - which is a stunner as an introduction to civilized life.  We dried out and then tried to head southbound on the AT but the monsoons hit and we found ourselves marooned in my little pup tent for the duration.  That was enough to finish off our hiking dream that fateful year.
Now David claims he'll hike from B&B to B&B, interested in a hot meal, warm soft bed, and glass of wine every night.  But with his 70 birthday coming up he suddenly began to make noise about joining me on the AT.  Really?  That would be so great!  The plan for him has more or less fizzled, though, and it seems more likely that he'll be home in Houston when I am starting on the trail.  
The idea is to go to Springer and head north - I'm thinking it would be good to get to Fontana Dam at least.  We'll see how things develop.  Then in the fall - late Sept?  head back to the Whites.  
In between these two could be a quick trip to Kenya to visit a buddy there.  WooHoo!!",,View Entry,"Dec 10, Sun",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581143,"It looks good for a departure in early April, then drive or catch a ride to Springer and get set for a NOBO walk to at least Fontana Dam.  I've begun to check over my gear.  It's really a bit too early to get ready for what might be only a 3 week hike, but it's too much fun to wait any longer.  I've been toying with the idea of making my own pack.  You know; something ultralight, fashionable, oh so chic, and maybe in a blaze orange.  Doesn't that sound good?  I'm also toying with the idea of not taking my DIY tent, though the roomy, uber flexible design with it's double doors, spacious floor and ample headroom all call to me.  AND it's cuben fiber so it won't absorb water and become crazy heavy.  Very appealing.  I'm putting some old gear on eBay to thin out the overstuffed bins that hold my hiking gear.  I mean, how many sleeping bags do I actually need and use?  I should sell those too.  At this point the only reason I keep them is to have stuff for friends and family.  Well, clearly I have tons of time to sort out these details.  I have accomplished the most difficult part, though; talking to my husband.  He is as supportive as he can be, given that he really misses me and doesn't want me to be gone.  He can be a worrier.  At least time and experience is helping him realize that I won't get eaten by bears or attacked by weirdos, nor am I likely to fall off a cliff.  He now knows I can find shuttles, get resupplied, and be fairly self-sufficient.  Having the InReach for daily contact is a plus, along with the regular phone calls.  I will miss home too.  It's not like Jer is alone in his wishes.  But more than missing home I want - maybe need - to be out on the trail.  It just does so much to keep me healthy and happy.  For that alone it is worth our relatively small family sacrifices.",,Home!,"Dec 12, Tue",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581906,"Even though I choose to be a section hiker I am still leaving my life behind for several weeks at a time.  Horse, dog; these two animals mean chores to be done.  Who does them?  My husband Jerry.  Filling in for me when I'm gone seems a reasonable expectation when only a few weeks are involved.  Even six months isn't too crazy to keep my dog, at least in my opinion.  I can always board my horse out to eliminate the need to have Jer get up early each day.  Sooooo, you might say, what's the problem?  In a perfect world there would be none.  In my world I have to negotiate around Jerry/my differences and his own needs.  I am an early bird.  Jer likes to sleep in.  I like to stay active.  Jer has a limited amount of activities he can do thanks to his body which is prone to injury and is carrying too much weight (mine too!).  I need to go backpacking.  He needs to sleep in his own bed.  I love adventure.  He loves to be home.  We started out, 30 some years ago, both being more like me.  Time and circumstance has created a divergence.Jer IS supportive of my hiking by covering chores for me and staying in touch and even seeming proud of my exploits when I am back home.  Yet each year I feel like I cringe and delay talking to him about my hiking plans.  I can tell he is unhappy.  Why haven't I gotten over it yet?  How long is this going to go on?  I can see him looking for the day I'll be happy to just stay home with him and be what he expects me to be; content to leave adventures and the trail behind me.  I can't imagine that day.  I began the hiking conversation a month or so ago.  He stiffened up, shoulders hunched.  He seemed to be thinking Oh no, here we go again.  The conversation didn't get far.  I asked him how I could include him more; get him to be excited or upbeat about my plans.  I rolled out several scenarios that I'd encountered while on the trail; husband does shuttling, stays in the hiking zone, meets up with wife every few days.  Or husband acts as trail boss and is intimately a part of wife's progress.  Neither appealed to Jer.  I understand, too.  He wants to be home where he is happiest.  We deepened the conversation a few weeks later, trying to examine our differences in a positive light.  I give Jer credit for recognizing that there are times when he can have unreasonable expectations for me.  Perhaps I have them for him too.  We both have realized that our differences can be damaging to our relationship and that there needs to be more emphasis on being/doing things together when we are together.  I explained how hiking the trail gave me a sense of self-actualization and accomplishment that I wanted.  Generally it was a good conversation.  More talking needs to happen.  Talking was allowing our feelings of distance and resentment to dissipate and become replaced by acceptance and change.  I know there is more to this.  There will be more work to do.  And I'm still feeling hesitant about talking about the hike, even though it captures my mind and heart every day.  I'm hoping that will change someday and we'll both be as excited about my hike as I think we can be.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Sat",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582160,"It looks, for now anyway, that we've squeezed through our rough part and the door to my adventuring is open and beckoning.  I have to give credit to my husband for being self aware and relatively open to change.  I have to credit myself for staying true to my dreams and remembering to support the ""us"" part of our marriage.  And none of this has been trivial to earn.  We've both worked hard at being understanding, at communicating, and at not giving up.  Despite Jer's reluctance to plan into the future, I've mapped out a full year of travel and adventure - some solo and some together.  In April I will hike for a couple hundred miles on the AT.  In June I will fly to Kenya for 10 days.  In September to October we will hit the road and drive to the west coast to visit our son and a host of friends, making a 5 week camper trip.  In 2019 we will head to Edinburgh for a walking vacation and I'll polish off another few hundred miles of the AT.  I think Jer has even gotten a bit excited by these plans and they have added energy and focus to our lives together.  Now I need to put together a plan of action for this spectacular year, starting with gathering my hiker gear and deciding on what to bring and what to jettison.  I'm toying with the idea of going partially stoveless.  Well, obviously I can't bring a partial stove (what would that look like?  a stove without fuel?) but how about eliminating the cookpot and just have a smallest alcohol cat food stove and my simple coffee cup?  It would mean I could still have a cup of tea or dried soup but wouldn't have to deal with the major fuss of making dinners.  That has a definite appeal.  Tortillas, sausage, cheese, dried fruit, nuts; this could work.  It has been a cold winter so far, though, so I'll keep my eye on the weather as my departure time nears.  If it's really cold I'll take my full hot meal program.Lots to do.",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Wed",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582801,"Time is whipping by in hyperdrive.  It's hard to believe we're nearly half way through February already when just yesterday we were watching little Cato enjoy his first Christmas.  Next week I roll the odometer over to another year as I turn 67.  I feel lucky to be able to still hike and play in the woods and enjoy life.  Hopefully all of the sins and body punishments I survived in my youth won't  come back to bite me in this, my fourth quarter.  Fourth quarter and going for overtime!I've begun hiking prep.  This means nearly daily walks of varying lengths, my longest so far being a ""hilly"" 10 miler.  The funny thing about hills is that they are never steep enough or long enough or hard enough here in my hometown of Wendell.  Even though it's considered a hill town, these hills are peanuts compared with what I've encountered on the trail.  Both the LT and the AT provide hills of a completely different caliber.  But I plow up these Wendell hills, pushing myself for speed and carrying a pack at times in order to get somewhat acclimated.  I began at about 23 miles/week, and I'll kick it up to about 30-35 tops, increasing gradually so I avoid any risk of injury.  I am always surprised at how quickly I can 'harden' up.  I suppose once you've pushed past a certain threshold of fitness, as long as you keep some level of activity, the body is primed to respond quickly to a challenge.  Or maybe it's easier to say I've become a tough old bird. Next comes the gear list.  OK, full disclosure; I've gathered enough gear over the past 7 years to equip a small army.  It's amazing how I can rationalize buying/keeping stuff that I'll probably never use, just in the name of experimentation.  Anything ultralight always catches my eye.   I spend a good portion of my sitting time combing hiking journals and blogs for equipment tips and hiking strategies.  Most of this is done in the winter, when sitting down time is more abundant.  Then comes the hiking season when I can put new gear and new ideas to the test.  I've been trying to decide between 3 packs:  ultralight, medium, heavyweight.  The heavyweight (about 3.3 pounds, Deuter Act Zero) is comfy, but maybe a bit too over-padded and restrictive.  The medium (about 2.3 pounds, older REI UL 45) is borderline comfortable and nicely free moving.  The ultralight (about 1.3 pounds Zpacks ArcBlast) is my old standby and generally a great choice, except for the delicacy of the fabric - or maybe I'm just hard on my gear.  The Zpacks has  a rip in the botton already.  But writing this makes me feel more like taking the old standby with a supply of duct tape as insurance.  For me, lighter is best.  I've never been able to get the Zpacks pack to stay arced, despite several attempts.  It just flattens out over time and miles.  It's still comfortable, but I'm going to work on making the frame more functional in the future.I'm leaning heavily toward taking my little Packafeather alcohol stove, a small amount of fuel, and just my coffee cup for heating soup and tea, and going basically cold.  Or maybe all cold.  To be determined.  I've discovered our local discount store - Ocean State Joblot - carries freeze dried fruit for cheap.  Yum.   And I've bought a gallon of permethrin since I have vowed never to get a tick bite again.  One case of Anaplasmosis and hospital stay was quite enough, thank you.  I keep treating my gear and clothes and so far no ticks.  A special purchase this year that has been completely worth it are my waterproof socks.  I had a pair before but putting them on my feet required an epic struggle.  It  finally dawned on me that a larger size might be in the offing, and sure enough, two lovely pink and black striped pair later, my feet are warm and dry in all conditions.  I use a pair of slick sock liners under them to facilitate warmth and on-ing and off-ing and they make my Altra trail shoes + gaiters the perfect winter boots!Yesterday I booked my flight to Atlanta and a campsite at the Amicalola SP.  I'll get to the park on the late side - around 9-10 p.m. - so won't start my hike until the following morning.  I'll be arranging a shuttle from the airport next.  Whether to start at the SP or catch a ride to Springer is still up in the air.  My goal is 200 miles-ish.  Not yet sure how I'll get back home, but that distance puts me in the Gatlinburg area and from there I can make it to Knoxville where there are planes and buses and rental cars.  Civilization at my disposal!  And Jer and I continue our improved path.  Life is good.  I am blessed.",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Sat",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583559,"OK.  I've got the one way ticket to Atlanta, the shuttle to Springer, the one way ticket back to Hartford, and the shuttle to get to the airport in NC.  The beginning and the end.   Now all I have to do is connect the dots.  I've planned out an itinerary for hiking 10-12 miles/day with just a few neros and the possibility of one zero and 4ish longer days.  The section is set up to go 21 days and 240 miles.  I'm putting in some miles here as prep yet I am remembering the 10+ miler I logged in the Whites last fall and I'm having a hard time imagining doing that day after day for 3 weeks.  Just a bit nervous, here!!!  I see myself as the Little Engine That Could sometimes, and hope that that persistent inner voice can propel me up the hills.  And down, which for me is often the harder part of the trip.  I think I can!  I think I can!  I think I can!All is set at home, or at least planned, except for food.  One day I'm going cold, the next I'm going back to the familiar stove/kitchen scenario.  The beauty of not carrying the additional pound of kitchen supplies v. the comfort of a hot cup of coffee in the morning and a steamy bowl in the evening.  I know part of the issue is not knowing for sure if the weather will be warm or will it be cold.  Shoulder season camping has it's surprises.  I've been caught in hot, humid, 90 degree weather and then again in freezing, foot stomping cold.  Where's my crystal ball??OK, deep breath.  One step at a time is the mantra.  No point in overthinking.  And thank you, for the kind words some have posted to my journal.  Your encouragement is very supportive and helpful.  I think I CAN!!",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Sat",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584257,"In three weeks I'll be in that unique world where every day is a decision to continue on.  It's as though life is compressed into its simplest terms until there is just one choice:  go or don't go.  No lists, no television, no video games, no cars and taxis and subways, no crowded sidewalks, in fact no sidewalks.  The trade-off is silence, challenge, beauty, mud, hills, views, snow, friendship, fundamental freedoms.  There will be days when the choice is easy:  Yes!  Go!  And there will be days when the choice is agony:  cold, lonely, sore.  
It's a world I cannot completely let go.  There are times on the trail when I am just so done with the trail I can't wait to get out.  Then when I'm actually done and home and warm and fed my heart sneaks back there, feeling my legs swing and watching the sun skate across the sky.  Addicted?  I suppose so.  But I'm OK with that.  
I've finally decided what to do about hiking with or without my stove.  I'm going to bring the thing.  Shoulder season hiking is a good time to just be prepared for cold and wet when a cup of hot soup or tea will fit in perfectly.  What isn't fitting in is the snow and cold.  The lovely temporary spring we had up here was just perfect for training.  The ground was clear and accessible. Then winter returned and it's back to ice and snow and slipping and slogging.  Well, I suppose slogging is a good workout.  My mileage will go down but the effort will go up.  
I'll be trying out a new HMG backpack to see if it qualifies as high on comfort and ease of use.  It's certainly in the running.  Just in case, I'm working on my tried and true Zpacks to overcome a few faults and get it ready to go.  Getting close to the starting line!",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Fri",0
Neon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585553,"The days are accelerating toward my departure this weekend.  Oddly, in reverse proportion, as time grows shorter my To Do list grows longer.  Get the dog food and pills set up.  Get the horse feed and hay ready.  Sort out the bills and banking and mail.  Check the weather.  Check the gear list.  Check the weather again.  Change over some gear to prepare for what looks like a chilly start.  Run to the store for last minute details.  Where did I put that little notebook?  Can't find it anywhere.  Have to get a new one.  I'm thinking I'll bring some 'rain pants'.  They are actually the bottom half of a tyvek painting suit that I bought at Home Depot a few years ago and at 2.8 oz they win the contest for rain gear.  I figure they might last the 3 weeks I'll be out.  Today's list:  bank, water bottle, notebook, dog food.  What am I forgetting?  Yesterday I activated my inReach - seems to be working and I'll test that today to make sure Jer can download the map ok.  I am letting my pre-hike walks fit in where they can this week.  After several weeks of gradual build up, last week I hiked 45+ miles spread out over 5 days which was my goal, with the longest being a 12 miler.   This week any hiking is gravy.  I'll be confirming my shuttle to Springer with Dave later this week.  I decided to take my 10 degree bag, which I'm sure seems like overkill to most, but I get cold easily at night and really hate to be shivering instead of sleeping, so I'm bringing goose down insurance.  Other than that, I'm still leaning toward trying out the HMG pack and leaving my old Zpacks at home.  The stove is coming with me as well.  Of course, it's snowing here again and I'm looking out the window to the flakes steadily crushing my thoughts of flowers and butterflies.  Sigh.  This winter has lingered long enough.  Planning to get ahead of the wet weather, I chose to clean out the barnyard yesterday.  Oy.  That was a good workout.  I pushed 13 chock-full wheel barrow loads uphill to Mt. Manure.  The hardest part, though, was raking and wrestling the soggy piles together.  I am surprised my arms and shoulders aren't hating me today.So the next time I post it will be after I've started the trail.  I've never tried posting from my phone but maybe this is the year to break that barrier.  We'll see.",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Mon",0
