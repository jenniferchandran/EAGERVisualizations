Mostly Sunny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/492986,"I've spent countless hours over the past couple of years reading the journals of AT hikers both section and through hikers and the desire to hike the trail myself has continued to grow more and more. Often a little voice in my head reminds myself that I am least 10 years from retirement and to dream about a through hike is a waste of time. Hell. In 9 years I'll be 60 and I already fear I wouldn't make it even at this age so another 8-10 years will only lower my chances...
Why do we have these cheery self doubt chats inside our heads? Whatever happened to dreaming big? I suppose the reality of responsibilities and the lives we lead don't really leave much room for big changes or new adventures or at least that has been my experience.
Still the dream lives on.
So...I've decided to take Andy Dufresne's point of view and ""Get Busy Living or get busy dying""! Enough of the waiting for the perfect opportunity I'm committing to a section hike leaving in 10 weeks!
The decisions may seem quick but I've been silently thinking about this for a very long time. Now it's time to nail down the particulars.

Mostly Sunny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493550,I've posted on white blazes the the following question...what section of the AT would you choose if you had 5-6 dAys? I'd like to see some thru hikers and some great views and can fly into any major airport but would prefer keeping the commute to less than a few hours between the airport and trailhead. Considering crawford notch to Franconia Notch southbound but a bit nervous RegArding the terrain? Someone suggested Harper's ferry to pa? Will there be any thru HIKERS in the area in late July?I would really appreciate anyone's suggestions? I need to make some decisions soon to get everything worked out....Ideas? Comments? Thanks!!,,so many choices,"May 09, Sat",0
Mostly Sunny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493819,"The plan is starting to come together...but what do I know about Maryland in July? Sounds like a nice name for a song eh? How about ""Harper Ferry to Waynesboro, PA""?Not to be mistaken with Waynesboro, VA ??.",,Maryland in July,"May 10, Sun",0
Mostly Sunny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497717,"I've landed on a plan to hike from PenMar Park near the Mason Dixon line to Harper's Ferry. I think it will be fun to say I've hiked the state of Maryland...of course all you wise and experienced hikers on this site won't fall for it but it does have a nice sound to it doesn't it? I'm going to hike across Maryland?Anyway, that's my plan. It looks like a three of four day hike but I'm going to take a bit longer just so I can be sure not to feel rushed so I can enjoy the views and stop and smell the roses. I suppose that may not be the case in July so maybe I will use the extra time to find and filter plenty of water!I hope to cross paths with some of you on the trail as I head south.",,PenMar to Harper's Ferry,"May 30, Sat",0
Mostly Sunny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504063,"I've had a request to post gear info and I appreciate the note (Jennifer) - stay tuned for details as well as a post from Harper's Ferry soon.Ill be leaving St Louis and flying to washington d.c. followed by the train to Harper's Ferry fairly soon - how fun right?Thanks to the AT guides, fellow trailjournal posts, books and the internet filled with handy suggestions I have arranged for a shuttle to give me a lift to Pen Mar State Park where I'll head South first to Raven Rock shelter for a short but steep first day.I think my chances of meeting some section and thru hikers is pretty good although more likely to cross paths with south bound hikers so late in July possibly? I hope to experienced both shelters as well as designated tent areas for backpackers and may spend the day in Greenbrier State Park...tbd!Thanks for your mail and support!",,counting down,"Jul 07, Tue",0
Mostly Sunny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505388,I've got that nervous-excited-butterfly-feeling building up inside...I head out Thursday for Harper's Ferry and then a quick stop at laurel lodge for the night then on to Pen Mar. This is for real now.,,butterflies,"Jul 15, Wed",0

Mostly Sunny,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506623,"At last! Left Pen Mar park heading south to Raven Rock shelter. Got a good laugh at the top of the Boulder field when I spotted this tree. It was a beautiful day with sunny skies and a slight breeze today. Short miles - steep, rocky climb. LOTS of hikers out today both day,section and thru hikers.Raven Rock shelter was very nice - very new - with many tent spots and areas for camp fires. I got my first look at a bear cable and hung my first bag. Fun!Great day!","Pen Mar
