Last week while sitting at home on my couch and reading parts of a journal post out load to my wife, she looked at me and said “why don’t you go?” With that statement the planning stage has begun.",,View Entry,"Oct 24, Tue",0
Scribe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587916,"Finally, less than 50 days until my hike begins!! I have been counting down since October of last year and it seems that time dilation has occurred!!  But I am so excited, I have found one or two other hikers that are starting in the days before me also from the Amicalola Falls so we might run into each other. But if not, I will look for them in the shelter journals. My daughter is still attempting to give me a trail name, it is interesting to hear her thoughts. 

Already have packed my pack a few times just to see how it fits. Which I have decided to call “Babe” after Paul Bunyan’s Blue Ox. Since my pack is blue and seems to hold everything I need. I have been taking Babe to the local gym with about 50% load weight (no food/water) and been getting on the stair climber and doing 70 or 90 flights of stairs. This is serving two purposes, one is getting the legs ready for the steps (what they call a hill in Georgia we call a mountain in Texas), then also seeing how Babe is fitting and load gear is shifting when climbing. So far, I have made a few adjust were some items are and it seems to fit better on the climbs.

Scribe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587909,"So today was an exciting day. I did a virtual shakedown with the famous Matt “Pretzel” Mason from Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap  (http://www.mountaincrossings.com). Even though I felt my pack was in good shape, he was able to still shave about 5 lbs. off my pack. Some simple items such updating my old Jetboil to some newer cooking gear (my Jetboil was the 2006 Group Cook System weighting in at almost 1.1lbs without fuel….I will miss it, we have been through allot together), then ditching one or two clothing options and a few items here and there.  

 If you are considering doing a virtual shakedown I cannot say enough good things. I spent almost 3 hours on the internet conference with him. We discussed everything from, my hiking goals, experience, personal health, current and expected status of the trail during my hike, variations of my hiking schedule based on the prior questions, food prep, and then item by item evaluation and discussion of every item of my pack list (which is allot longer than the gear list with my journal.)

The planning started back in October of 2017 and it is almost here. So far 2 trial packings of ""babe"" have occurred. Everything seems to fit okay, at this point I am simply moving things from various compartments for easier access. The count down continues!!!",,View Entry,"May 10, Thu",0

Scribe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590985,"Day 1
Arrived after a very uneventful flight. Ron with Ron’s Shuffle Service was there waiting for me. After a few hours in the car he dropped me off at the beginning of the approach trail about a mile and half from the lodge were I was the staying the first night. 
Received my first trail magic from Ron and got my first passport stamp.
Weighted my pack with food for 5days and water it came in at 38 lbs.  A little heavier than I want but I think I can decrease it a little over time. Got a shakedown by Park ranger and he could only find 2 things to decrease (size of fuel canister and extra pair of socks) I also officially signed in at the visitor center. 
Started the hike which took me past the base of the falls to the top with amazing views. (70 stories later) Amazing views ... brief passing shower right before I started but otherwise clear skies.","Amicalola falls vistor center

Scribe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591668,"Left at little later than I had planned. The Lodge's internet had be out the day before and was back up this morning. So I stayed to up date the posts from day 1. I hit the trail at 0930. Most of the hike was very quite. I only encountered 3 different day hikers and 2 other NOBO hikers. One of these hikers scared me to death. I had just finished taking a photo and was fighting with my zipper on my belt pouch to close it back up when I heard this heavy fast pounding coming up behind me. (Now the day before the park ranger had mentioned there has been a very PERSISTENT bear in the area). So when I heard the pounding I thought ""Oh great a bear I need my camera..."" Then the thought of ""That is very close and fast if its a bear then......"".  
Title of Houston Chronicle: ""Conroe AT Hiker Killed by Bear within One mile of starting the AT""

The hiker thought this was to funny. All I can say was he was moving fast, I have never seen him again. 
The hike was gorgeous and then I approached the summit of Spring Mountain. As I drew closer I began to hear a low rumbling sound. The thoughts were that of train or waterfall, but I did not remember either of those being on any maps I saw. And it was it was the massive rain shower. As soon as I emerged from the woods onto the crest it started. So stayed there and waited for about 30 minutes for it to pass so I could sign the log book and get some photos.  The is were I met Matt ""Pittsburgh"" for the first time he stayed behind to have his lunch.
Then it was off for Stover Creek for the night. Stopped by Black Gap Shelter just to enter my name in the log book and have lunch.

Scribe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591670,"Rested okay last night at Stover Creek. Met several people (Lydia, Southside, Adam, Hunter, Hammock) at the shelter. 
A bear came by and woke me around 0100 rustling near the tent. ""Hammock"" (who was sleeping in a Hammock) said it brushed his hammock enough it caused him to sway. He left us be.
We had place all our food in the bear box supplied by the AT so we did not have to hang it. 
Had breakfast and then stopped at Stover Creek to fill up with water on my way out solo at 0800. The AT trail continues directly on the other side of Stover Creek.

The remainder of the hike was extremely enjoyable with occasional breezes and no rain. Lydia and Southside ended up catch up to me around mile 2. We hiked for a mile or  so together but their pace is way faster than I like to go (this becomes a continual thing with the three of us meeting up at sometime during the day, and then me seeing them at the end of day at camp). We ended up seeing each other at Long Creek Falls were took pictures for each other in front of the falls. Then we left.

We all ended up meeting up again this time also with Adam and Hunter at the base of the Sassafras Mountain / Justin Mountains. We were all fueling up based on what we had heard to expect....and they were right!! 
We all hit the Dirt Road at mile 13.5 {AWOL} (24.5 with Approach) at the end of the mountains and were taking a breather when we heard the rumbling start. We all geared up for the rain...and I took off. I was about half up Kelly Knob when it hit. It turned the trails into streams and it just kept getting worse. 
We made it Gooch Mountain Shelter with it still pouring. It slowed to a sprinkle so I set up my tent. It continued as a light rain all night. The shelter became extremely full as other hikers trickled in. Myself and 5 others used a hammock or tented and 9 slept in the shelter.","Stover Creek

Scribe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591674,"So far last night was one of my best nights of sleep so far on the trail. I only woke up 2 times (1145, 0430). But apparently people sleeping in the shelter did not rest so well do to a choir of snoring from multiple people. (Again why I tent away from the shelter). When I woke at 0430 I thought I might pack up and leave but it was raining so I figured I would wait...which resulted in me falling back to sleep. I did a real lite breakfast and hit the trail by 7 am knowing that his was going to be a long day with ""Blood Mountain"" in our future. Being the tallest mountain in Georgia at an elevation of 4,458 feet and then today being a distance of 15.4 miles it was going to be long. 
There were some amazing view from Preaching Rock @ 3593 feet and Big Cedar Rock @ 3737 (There are pictures in the photo section). I had lunch by myself on the overlook and enjoyed the amazing views. I can only imagine what it looks like when the trees change color.
At Gaddis Mountain the group (Lydia, Southside, Hunter and Adam) caught up to me. Pittsburgh had apparently fallen off with some knee pain at the last campsite. (Pittsburgh is the only one who is a thru hiker in our bunch). We all had the same goal of Neels Gap.
The boys (Pittsburgh, and Hunter) took of ahead of us to see if they could get a hostel bed or cabin at Neels Gap for us all before it closed its doors 5pm. This took pressure of the three of us. So we all took our time going up Blood Mountain. (We were all saying how it was not near as hard as Sassafras Mountains). 

We walked into the store at 445 pm. The boys and gotten our accommodations secured so all we had to do was get food.
I enjoyed a full Red Baron Meat Pizza, 2 Rootbeers, 2 Hersey Bars and 3 liters of water....ahh it was good. Then took a nice BOILING SHOWER!!!
Oh and it rained.

Scribe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591675,"Left out of Mountain Crossings later than I had planned. I was having issues with my Sawyer Filter leaking (the Sawyer Filter is used to filter water from streams). It turned out that at some point one of the internal o-rings fell out. They replaced it at no charge. I gathered some resupplies and was out siding trying to get pictures from their patio but it was just to much fog. It had rained again during the night. (Should have taken it the evening before).
Pittsburgh showed up. Apparently he had arrived really late after we had all turned in. So we said our hello/goodbyes and exchanged contact info as he was going to have a zero day to rest his knee. Claudia and Southside were starting to resupply when I left and would be following behind me.  I have never seen Hunter or Adam again, according to the desk they had turned clothes in for washing and gone back to bed, so I suspect they were going to zero also. 
So I hit the trail later than I every have at 0940. I was 15 minutes into the hike and the rain started. It was just a lite rain but unfortunately it kept the fog obscuring all the views. As the day went on the rain got worse again turning the trails into rivers, (one of the reasons not so many pictures of the day). I have learned not to worry about rain gear just get wet. The one time I have tried to hike with rain gear I was baking from the heat. So far my experience is just get wet and hope to dry out between the next shower hits and watch out for signs of hypothermia.
HIKING POLES!!!! THEY WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE!!!  or at least my Black Diamond saved mine. I was going over some smooth rocks on the edge of a several hundred foot drop when my shoes slid out from under me. If not for me having braced my right pole on stable ground next to the edge that would have been a bad day. I sat there on my left knee and my right leg sprawled out  over the edge and my right hand holding firmly on to my right treking pole still stuck in ground. I sat that way for several seconds think that would have been bad and just contemplating things. 
So I forever will be an advocate for trekking/hiking poles!! So before someone says it...""See hiking alone is dangerous you should be in a group."" My statement back would have been yes, if I was in a group they could have watched me fall to my death and had that in their memory for the rest of their lives. There would have been nothing for them to do. 
Lesson to prevent this from happening. A post-incident evaluation:
Lesson 1: Hike Slow on uneven slippery terrain
Lesson 2: Use your poles
Lesson 3: Pay attention, no day dreaming.....this is what i was doing. 
Today on the 5th  of my hike I have found that I am hiking solo about 90% of the time. But I also know someone is a few hours ahead or behind me...

The rain eventually slowed and I made into Low Gap. Set up camp for the night on high ground as heavy storms are expected. But, unfortunately most of the terrain is sloping at Low Gap.

Scribe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591679,"So lets just say last night was AAGGGHH!. The rain started at 7pm and continued throughout the night. The rain was so hard that it ran off the rain fly and bounced up off of the ground on the underside of the vestibule getting through the netting into the tent. Since my tent was on a slight slope it allowed it to run to the bottom foot area and everything else at the top of the tent near me. By morning I had over 2 inches of accumulated water in the bottom of my tent. Resulted in only about 2 hours of sleep, but I got to spend allot of time listening to the rain and thinking about things. I got up at 6 and started to pack and try and dry things out. I am headed to Unicoi Gap were I will shuttle into Hiawassee, Georgia for a overnight and zero day. The hiking was wet for the first 4 hours as it would drizzle and then stop. This is the closest to a non-rain day I had in a while and I was enjoying the views. Joyce (a shuttle service I got from Ron) picked me up at Unicoi Gap at 130 pm. Why waiting I was able to get some great photos and talk to ""Whisper"" and incredible woman who is section hiking but has already thru and was telling me about trails-rails (which I need to lookup as well as her trail journal). As I was waiting for my shuttle, Lydia and Southside came out of the trail. They were being picked up by another shuttle and taken back to the falls as tomorrow they had to fly home. We exchanged goodbyes and info, they were fun to hike with and I look forward to seeing them again. Now off to cleanup, was clothes and dry out gear (especially shoes). Scribe","Low Gap Shelter

I am just taking it easy getting ready for tomorrow when I head back out from Unicoi Gap. Watching it raining in the mountains over the trails from my Hotel Room.
