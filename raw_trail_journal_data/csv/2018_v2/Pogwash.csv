After 3 years of planning and dreaming about this, it's finally here! Most of my preparations are completed. Now I'm just hanging out with family and friends as often as possible before driving to Georgia.",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Tue",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583239,"its now less than 40 days before I start my long awaited adventure on the AT!! I have the majority of my gear and clothes already planned out. I'm just working on the little (and arguable the most important) things: water filter (sawyer squeeze), cook system (if I even decide to cook), light (going to use Lucy lite), etc.My family and friends are asking almost everyday now about the trip. I am telling everyone. The more people that know, the more it will hold me accountable for when I have tough days out on the trail to continue heading north!",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Fri",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583291,I don't really have much to say in this post. Just making sure to get up my 3rd post for the site. But it is 1 day closer to my AT thru hike attempt on April 2nd!! I have been talking to a couple people on Trail Forums. I found somebody else who is starting just a few days after me. Awesome!! Good luck to all hikers this year!! Happy trails!,,View Entry,"Feb 24, Sat",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583348,"just another update. I have to get into the habit of Journaling on this site before my trip. If I don't don't now, I won't be in the habit and won't be consistent. 
I had my first AT thru hike dream last night. Haha. I dreamt I was in town resupplying with a group of friends. I was wearing my spiderman shirt! I only lift weights in this shirt, so it's highly unlikely I'll actually be wearing it on trail ;). But I know starting time is getting close when I begin having dreams! Still continuing to spend as much time as possible with friends and family. Watched the Walking Dead with my sister last night. So sad Carle died :(
Until next post!",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Mon",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583436,"This is the last day of February for 2018. March 30th is when my mom, sister, brother, and myself are driving down to Georgia! We have rented a cabin near Amicalola State Park where we will be staying the weekend and spending Easter together. The day after Easter is when my family will abandon me in Georgia for the journey of my life to this point!
I'm really looking forward to the night before going to Georgia though. My best friend (who is an Eagle Scout and has been a huge help for my preparations for the trip) will be coming over to stay the night. Our intentions are to stay up all night playing games and just hanging out, since we won't see each other for a couple months.
That's all for now. Just ordered my new Sawyer Squeeze and bear bag from amazon. 
Until next time!",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Wed",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583550,"So as everyone can see, my trail name (at least for now) will be Intern. Now how did I get that name?Well last summer (2017) I did my college internship with the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC). It was an incredible experience and I learned so much from all the men and women who volunteer with the orgaization!One weekend I was out with a Ridge runner in SNP and we had been camping with a hiker who's name was Einstein. He came up with the idea to name me Intern. I liked the sound of it and if a man named Einstein gives me a name, well, I'm going to keep it until something better comes up.Just a little background on my name and past.Only 30 days left before starting my hike off Springer mountain!!",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Sat",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583853,"well here we are another day closer to the start of my AT thru hike attempt. It's only 3 full weeks away now. My motivation to do much of anything but hike is starting to decrease drastically. It's like having senioritis all over again, which I just went through last year during college. We 50+ mph winds last weekend and it did some damage on the trail. So many blow downs across the trail. So I took it upon myself to go not and do a little trail maintenance. My dog was unable to go over or under a few trees. I had to actually pick her up. If you've never picked up a 100 lb dog in the woods, in the cold, and mud, and with a pack. Not fun. And I didn't expect any Trail Patrolman anytime soon. So I knew a few areas needed to be worked on.I can't wait to hike this weekend. 10+ miles is on the schedule for both Saturday and Sunday. I really need to release some stress after this past week. Hiking is the best way for me to do that, being able to just get away from everyone and everything for a little while. I'd have to say it was a mixture of a great week and the week from hell! Well that's all for now. Come AT! Get here faster! I'm ready!",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Fri",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584187,"I am now only 18 days away from beginning my greatest adventure to this point of my life. Still continue to purchase little miscellaneous items (eye cover (will probably go against this), ear plugs, glasses retainer, etc.) That I will need on the trail.I have been spending a ton of time with friends lately and staying up waaay later than what is normal for me. I'm having a blast!! But I'm ready to be on trail sleeping and waking with the sun.That's all for now. Springer Mountain, I will be seeing you very soon!",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Thu",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584493,"well after 2 absolutely beautiful days here in VA. It's now looking like rain for the majority of my final 13 days at home.Also, on another note, it's looking like I'll be beginning my thru hike in the rain!! Woop woop!! I was hoping for a nice day to start. But hey, 60 degrees during the day, knowing I get to walk thru the woods all day and sleep outside at night. Yeah, I'm not letting rain stop me! No rain, no Maine! I'm getting rain right from the start. Which also means the only people that will be out will be thru hikers. Less trail impact for a few days. Nothing wrong with that.I am getting really excited/nervous/anxious/happy for the beggining!! I am going to miss all of my family (this of course includes my 2 cats Oreo and Dot), friends, and the kids I work with who make my life very entertaining every single day :):). But I know everyone is supporting and cheering me on. I won't let you guys down!Going to try going hiking anyway today and tomorrow with what looks like buckets of rain, snow, and sleet.  Should be a great time!",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Tue",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585266,"Today is the day we (my mom, sister, brother, and myself) are driving down to Springer Mountain for the start of my AT hike!! I am starting my hike on Monday, April 2nd. I can't believe that after 3 years of preparing for this, it is finally here!Yesterday was a really tough day though. I had been spending a lot of time with family and friends this last month. It was ridiculously hard saying good bye to all of them! But it's not for good. Also saying good bye to my kids at work was hard. I love each and every one of them as if they were my own. But I know they are in good hands while I'm away. But yeah, my pack is all packed up. I'm so glad I've been hiking with an overloaded pack the last 2 months. Because with all my gear and food (no water yet), my pack is so light!! This is going to be an incredible experience!! Let's go AT!!",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Fri",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585389,"So my trail name has changed from Intern to Pogwash. Pogwash is a word that was created by my best friends and myself as kids. 
The definition of pogwashing is to ditch somebody who has left momentarily. For example: if one person goes to use the bathroom. Someone else in the group says pogwash, then everyone goes and hides. When the bathroom user comes back. Everyone is gone and they either have to find everyone or just sit and wait.
I was reminded of this word from my best friend, Richard Harris, of 18 years the other night! I of course went with it because it is such a fun word, it's original, and it is a reminder of my childhood and some of the things we used to do, also it has a great meaning that could be used during a thru hike ;).
So on trail I will be known as Pogwash!
It is only 2 days until I start on my thru hike journey. Also my sister will be joining me for the first day and a half :) super pumped to get to hang out with Sabrina for an extra day and a half. Love you girl!!",,View Entry,"Mar 31, Sat",0
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585663,"Day 1 of my AT hike!! Started with my sister at Amicalola Falls with a destination of Hawk Mountain shelter.
I started this entry from springer to keep the mileage accurate with the trail.
The approach trail was up and down for the entire 8.8 miles before reaching sprinter mountain. Once reaching springer it was pretty smooth sailing from there. There was a long decline from the top. And we went through a forested area that reminded us of Jurassic park. Water was plentiful, no worries about becoming dehydrated. The weather got up to about 75 and perfectly sunny!
After another 8.1 miles, we finally arrived at camp for the night. There were a good amount of people. It was tough to find a tent spot. But we managed!
Once we arrived at camp, we got water, ate dinner, and made a few phone calls. By the time all this was done, it was about time to head to bed.
It was a great first day on the AT!! Thanks Sabrina for hiking with me all day!","Springer Mountain

Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585665,"DAY 2 on the AT! We woke up at 6 am and strated our day at 7 am. Sabrinas plan was to hike 4 miles with me to Cooper Gap. Before that though, we had to kick Sassafras Mountain in the ass! It was 1.5 miles up, luckily there were a few switchbacks helping out. 
But after she left me and I said bye to her, mom, and brother, it was time to keep hiking.
I had intentions of staying at Jerard Gap, with a thought of going 23 miles to Neels Gap. By the time I got to Jerard it was about 330. I decided Neels was going to be a tad far for the day. So I decided on an in between point at woods hole shelter. Tomorrows day will start with a fun fun climb up blood mountain. And we'll see where the day takes me :). I'm happy and being social at camp tonight. Everyone have a great night!","Hawk Mountain Shelter
",Woods Hole Shelter,"Apr 03, Tue",19.50
Pogwash,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585746,"this was a great day. Started out at the base of blood mountain in the fog and rain.
Had a good climb to the top, unfortunately no views though :( but after that I decended into needs gap where I did a little resupply and phone charge. I am carrying about 8 days of food right now! I love food!!
After needs gap the wind really picked up! Like 20 to 25 mph for the remainder of the day. We skirted around the mountains most of the day.
I hiked alone for hours until I came across another thru hiker, Kyle from Vermont. So we talked and hiked together the final 7 or 8 miles to blue mountain shelter. The water source here is not good. The shelter is beautiful and has bear cables for food.
But I am calling it an early night and am in my sleeping bag getting ready to play some sudoku  (thanks Sabrina for leaving them for me, love you!)
But I am safe tonight and looking forward to more miles on the AT tomorrow!!","Woods Hole Shelter
