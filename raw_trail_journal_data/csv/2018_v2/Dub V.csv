Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583027,"So here for the first time publicly, I announce my intention to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail beginning April 1st from Harper's Ferry.  Please take time to read the ""About my Hike"" tab, and my bio for further information on my route and my reasons for hiking.
For the past month I've been gathering gear and doing research.  I am pretty much a virgin to backpacking since my boy scout days forty years ago.   I have purchased an Ospry-Atmos 65 backpack, a Big Agnes-Fly Creek UL2 MountainGlo tent, and a Nemo-Riff 15 degree spoon shaped, down sleeping bag with gills for a little ventilation if needed.  The sleeping bag was my biggest equipment expense.  Specialized hiking clothing expenses have required my doctor to up my blood pressure medication.  As they say on the trail, ""Cotton kills,"" and that's all I had. 
I plan on writing a book about my journey (even though I can't diagram a sentence).  So far I have two chapters written.  Tentatively, the title is, ""The Green Tunnel - A Journey of Peace and Freedom along the Appalachian Trail.""  Let's hope the Peace and Freedom part holds true.  Otherwise, I may have to change the title to ""The Dark Tunnel of Doom - One Man's Journey through Hell."" 
For training, I am working on working on walking 100 miles about five to ten miles at a time before my departure.  I also want to go on at least two overnighters, weather permitting to dial in my pack and weight.  That's about it.
I am carrying two epi-pens with me because I have a life threatening anaphylactic history with stinging insects.  ""Epinephrine"" probably should be my trail name, but I came up with a better one while registering for this journal (see Trail Name Story tab).  I certainly do not want some joker on the trail tagging me with a dumb name like Trailbreath or Skidmark, so I went ahead and picked my own name. 
Please sign my guestbook before you go, and if you don't mind, please say a little prayer for safe travels and fun times on the trail.   Thanks a million!

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583047,"I may be reconsidering my plans to flip-flop.  People on Facebook are strongly advising against starting SOBO from Harper’s Ferry because when I meet the NOBO bubble it will seem more crowded than if I hike with the flow.  I’m told that at times I’ll pass people going North every 15 minutes or so from mid Virginia to Georgia, which to me would stink to high heaven.
I will be meeting with somebody this week who did a NOBO thru-hike last year, so I’ll be able to get an accurate gauge on what to expect starting from Springer should I decide to do a full NOBO.
People are saying that if I stick with a Flip Flop hike, that it would be better to start NOBO in late April from Harpers Ferry instead.  That way I’d avoid the Virginia heat in summer and be able to enjoy the fall colors in the Shenandoahas on the flip, and there would be no worries about reaching Katahdin before it closes.  
The drawback to that, is that I wanted to summit Katahdin at the end of my hike in order to experience the emotions and camaraderie associated with finishing up the traditional way.  And it would also mean a later start to avoid the mud season in Vermont.  I’m already itching to start and waiting another three weeks may require anxiety meds or ending my lifelong cannibis abstinence.
If I start in Georgia, I’m going to experience overcrowding and probably have to put up with the party crowd for a while, which is definitely not my style.  Plus, there’s a chance of contracting Norovirus as has apparently been epidemic at the start for several seasons.

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583078,"Yesterday I hiked 13 miles on the Allegheny Highlands Rail Trail with no pack.  It was about 37 degrees.  Started in Elkins, WV and went to the Kerens, WV trailhead and back.  Beautiful sunny day after 2 weeks of dreariness and rain.  
I did the hike in 4 hours 45 minutes which would make my speed 2.73 miles per hour.  I took a couple of 5 minute breaks.  I was definitely spent at the end, but it was a good jaunt.  I ran into an old friend walking his dog, which was really nice, but it made me feel ancient chatting about old times.  Plus he's in better shape than me.
I took my new Black Diamond- Ergo-cork grip Trekking poles.  I absolutely love them.  I can see where the ergonomically slanted handles make kicking-out the poles a much more natural motion.  I adjusted the height up a couple times to force me to improve my walking posture.  No knee pain whatsoever.  I'd recommend watching Bigfoot's video on how to use trekking poles.  It was very helpful.  I took along rubber tips to slip on over the carbide tips during the asphalt portion of the trail and they worked like a charm, a lot less vibration.  I'll consider taking them on the AT to keep in my side pant pocket for the rare times they might be beneficial (they weigh next to nothing and take little space).
I layered with a base layer, a fleece, and a puffy.  The puffy came off within a mile due to the heat and sweat.  Luckily it packed down enough to stow in my hip-pack pocket.  My Kuhl-Renegagde convertible hiking pants were great.  I love them.  They are slightly heavier than the Columbia pants, but seem to be some derned tough britches.  Plus, they are formed to angle at the knees which means less rubbing. The side pocket has an easily accesable inner pocket that is perfect for my phone.  I also wore compression socks with Darn Tough hiker crews over top, and leggings.  I think that helped my calves a lot and I'm sure aided in recovery as I am sore this morning, but not as sore as I thought I'd be.  
Footwear - Talus-Trek waterproof hiking boots. They are rated for day hiking, but I think they will be fine for the AT to start with.  I was pleased with the Superfeet liners I put into the boots.  I could feel a big difference as the gave my arches and heels lots more support.  They felt a little odd at first but didn't take long to form up to my feet.
Overall, It was a good little trek.  It is the farthest I've walked in about 5 years.  It does make me realize that I have a lot more shape to get into before April 1st, but thats what I expected.
It is hard to believe my Brothers-n-Law and I walked 25 miles on that rail-trail a few years ago, some of it through fallen trees and brush after the infamous northeast Durecho weather event of 2012.  
I'm so anxious about hiking the AT, I wish I could leave for the trail tomorrow.","Elkins, WV

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583145,"I saw my physician today for a pre-hike appointment to discuss some issues that might be of concern on the trail.  My doc is new to me since I changed health systems last year.  My main concerns medically are as follows:
1.  I have a life-threatening anaphylactic history with stinging insects.  My doctor gave me a new prescription for two fresh epi-pens and a prednisone dose pack for emergencies. I'm also going to take some Benadryl with me.
2.  I have very bad seasonal allergies.  My doctor says that I should continue to take Allegra daily, and on the really bad days I can take Allegra D as well. I may however, take Sudeferine supplementally instead of Allegra D as recommended by another doc who hiked the AT.  I am almost certain I will need another prednisone dose pack at some point for seasonal allergies.  I usually require a corto-steriod dose pack once or twice a year anyway (without being in the woods).  So, I do have a real fear that allergies could cut my hike short.  
3.  I take Norvasc for my blood-pressure, and I wanted to make sure it is OK to take Advil for inflammation on the trail (I was told by a pharmacists that I should discontinue use of similar Alieve while taking Norvasc).  My Doctor says it is OK to take Advil and that I might go ahead and take one every day on the trail to help with inflammation.
4.  I did not discuss my occasional ""fluttery feeling"" valve issue.  I just don't want to hassle with a cardiologist, tests, and all that at this point.  I had angioplasty a couple years ago and that seemed like much ado for nothing and a lot of expense.  My brother had a valve replacement last year, so yes, it may be the beginnings of something.  But since I feel pretty good, I'm not worried about it.  An unwise decision?  Perhaps, but I'm not getting any younger and I'm betting that the very act of hiking as great exercise, and the inevitable weight loss, will cause my heart to function better.  Had I not had the angioplasty done already with good results, I would have mentioned it to my doctor.  Its not like I'm a rambling wreck. I whole-heartedly do not recommend anyone else take the same risk even as slight as I feel it may be for me.  That's called a disclaimer.      
Beyond that, I should be good to go.  My bum knee and hip has been holding up well on my many training walks and through my first pre-hike, so I'm pretty confident I'll be able to manage that, but fully expect to have to take some zero days from time to time.  I might even take some Osteo-biflex as a supplement for better knee function.",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Wed",0
Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583234,"Last night I slept in my tent for the first time, urban camping in my back yard.  It was uncomfortable and I didn't sleep well at all but I'm sure I'll get more adjusted on the trail.
This morning until afternoon I worked on trying to cut my pack base weight.  Base weight is without food, water, and fuel.  I'm down to 33 lbs but still have a long way to get to the 25 lb recomended vicinity.  I'm going to have to cut clothes to a bare minimum, do away with some things in my first aid kit, and maybe ditch the sleeping bag liner and my fleece jacket.  I might even have to ditch the Jetboil stove setup for something lighter as a last resort.  Ounces make pounds.  
Preparing to live minimally is taking a lot more time, thought, and effort than I originally thought it would.     
This evening my wife and I had dinner with new acquaintances met on an AT facebook page.  They are a couple our age who thru-hiked the entire AT together last year.  Doc and Tinkles are two of the most genuine people I've met. We had a great time and were thoroughly entertained and mesmerized by their awesome trail stories.  I also got some very valuable feedback on logistics, and some good lodging information.  I can see how thru-hiking the AT is a life changer and a character builder.  I feel very fortunate to have crossed paths with these two.  I also came to find out that Doc works with my my daughter at a local clinic... How cool is that!  An AT serendipity before I've even touched the trail.  
I'm now leaning on starting out in Georgia instead of Harpers Ferry, possibly starting out with Doc and his bro as they do a section hike together in April... If I can wait that long.",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Thu",0
Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583296,"I've decided definitively, to change my thru hike from Flip-Flop to NOBO.  I have the opportunity to start with both a seasoned AT thru-hiking veteran and someone who is probably as green as me, as they do the Georgia section.  It is an opportunity too tempting to pass up.  Plus there's a physician on board.  
So at the first part of April, I'm headed to Springer and very enthused about it.  The man upstairs seems to be looking out for me already.

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583441,"I walked 10 miles through town yesterday in 3-1/2 hours, no breaks, with hiking boots.  My feet got a little blistery on the bottoms.  I may have to consider trail-runners.
I reduced my pack base-weight down to 28.5 lbs by removing a bite kit, reducing the first aid kit to bare minimum, removing some clothing articles and my sleeping bag liner, and combining some containers.  My Jetboil stove setup is a bit heavy but I'm too stubborn to replace it with a lighter setup since I already spent money on it. I hope the convenience and efficiency of the Jetboil will be worth it.  
Also, my ""pharmacy"" is problematic because I require so many darned allergy medications.  The Awol guide is quite heavy too, so I may or may not tear it into sections and have them mailed to me as needed.  It just seems wasteful to have periodic mail drops sent for just a few pages.  I would like to minimize mail drops as much as possible for the freedom from not having to schedule specific town visits.  It would be nice to eliminate mail drops all together.  Anyway, I still have some work to do on pack base-weight (base-weight is pack weight without water, food, and fuel).  As mentioned before, I want my total loaded pack weight not to exceed 35 lbs.
I told my oldest brother about going on the Appalachian Trail, but I only told him that I was doing the Georgia section starting out with friends.  I didn't mention that I was attempting the whole thing in order avoid the ""Are you nuts!?"" comments that brothers ""lovingly"" dish out because, well, they're brothers and thats what older brothers do when they're looking out for you.  Nonetheless, he has always entertained the notion of hiking the AT (he hitchhiked across the country in the 1970's when that was all the rage) and it might be cool if he could drop me off at the trailhead in Georgia as he returns to Florida from a visit next week (I haven't mentioned that to him yet).  Doing so would again alter my plans and move up my start date considerably, which I would like.  My Dad is in a nursing facility and I fear he may be due for a decline in the next few months.  The sooner I can leave and get back home, even if by only a couple weeks, the more at ease I will feel.  But it would mean starting alone, which I don't really mind.  
I always said that if I hiked the Appalachian trail, it would be after my Dad passes. However, everyone including the doctors thought he would be gone five years ago. He is afflicted with Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's, and can no longer walk.  He used to be an avid walker.  In fact, he gave up a car in mid-life because he didn't feel the need for one when everything he needed was in walking distance from home (that was the accountant in him).I feel my window of opportunity for hiking the AT is closing quickly, so If I can channel some my old man's toughness and perseverance, perhaps, I'll be able to touch the sign on Katadhin it while he is still alive.  He will be 89 in a few days.

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583694,"Well, It looks like my brother will be dropping me off at Amicalola Falls this Friday, March 9th.  I will be staring the approach trail, under the arch on Saturday.  Will stay at the Lodge on Friday night. It means a lot to me to have my brother with me to see me off since the hike is dedicated to our Dad who, as Stated before, was a lifelong avid walker and is now afflicted with Parkinson's and cannot walk.
I thought that since I'm hiking anyway, that I might as well try to raise some money for Parkinson's Research.  I've begun a fundraising page through the Micheal J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.  I'm gong to try to get my other brother to help on the social media end because he's a Facebook Whiz.

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583759,"I posted the obligatory photo of my gear on an AT Facebook group page today and got totally labmbasted about carrying too much stuff.  In fact, someone tagged me with the trail name ""U-Haul."" That's OK because it did help me to cut down on the weight again.  My base weight is now about 25 pounds, and full pack is 36 pounds.  I am so relieved about this.  Being almost an Eagle Scout as a youngster, our motto was ""Be Prepared,"" so naturally I tried to prepare for everything.  I am the type who likes every cubby hole filled with something useful and a plan for every contingency.  That's not necessarily the best philosophy on the AT.  In the case of long-distance hiking, it appears to be a more spiritual philosophy, trusting that the trail provides.  Most of the AT has civilization within a reasonable distance.  I'm told that the trail community becomes a family and that help in a pinch is usually nearby.
I'm rethinking hiking for a cause.  I don't think I'll do it now because it is just one more thing to worry about.  I'd love to raise money for Parkinson's research to honor my Dad, but I don't have the outside support to make it happen without stressing.  First and foremost, I want to enjoy my hike, live in the moment, experience nature, and commune on a personal level with the man upstairs.

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583809,"My last full day at home for hopefully quite a while.  It was also my father's 89th birthday. Parkinson's and Alzheimers have taken its toll on him but he has a great attitude.  If I can channel half of that sense of contentment on the trail I'll be in good shape.  Dad always said happiness is a choice.  ""You can be happy or sad, I choose to be happy.""  I think he got that quote from Nat King Cole a long time ago and it stuck with him.
It was awesome to spend yesterday with my wife, my brothers and my Dad. I wish I could have seen some other people whom I care deeply about (Renae's family, my kids and Grandkids), but there are only so many hours in the day and in real life people have to work. 
I spent the early part of the day straightening the house, tweaking my pack, and running last minute errands.  I had to put on a knee brace because naturally my knee is starting to act up, but I'm not too worried.  By evening everything fell into place. We celebrated Pop's birthday, had a great meal at Miss Piggies Bar-b-que, and topped it all off by watching the Mountaineers manhandle Baylor in the Big Twelve Tournament.  A great day indeed.
I got up this morning at 6:30 with ""Trail Brain""... And so I leave today, thanks to my brother's willingness to shuttle me to Georgia for a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.  With the blessings and support of my immediate family... it starts now.  I have reservations at the Amicalola Falls Lodge for tonight.  Tomorrow I will hike the Approach Trail 8-1/2 miles to the beginning of the AT atop Springer Mountain, Georgia.  I'll touch the plaque, and who knows, perhaps six months later I'll kiss the sign atop Mt. Katahdin in Northern Maine.   For now it doesn't seem real but I'm sure the rain and the cold, and the hunger, and at times the loneliness  will make it real soon enough.  The Appalachian Trail is at hand...

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583860,"Yesterday I chauffeured my brother on the 10 hour drive from West-by God, to Amicalola State Park.  It seems we laughed the entire way.  I thoroughly enjoyed driving as it might be my last time behind the wheel for a while.  We were greeted by a beautiful sunset over the northern Georgia mountains of which our room overlooks. 
There is a writer’s retreat here featuring a Pulitzer Prize winner and a New York Times best selling author.  I never heard of either.
We ordered a Pizza and I fell asleep listening to a streaming radio broadcast of the Mountaineers beating higher seeded Texas Tech in the Big Twelve Tournament.  On to play (beat) Kansas in the the finals tomorrow. 
I am a snorer, my brother uses a c-pap machine, and both of us were gassy from fast food yesterday.  At one time during our slumber it was like being at a NASCAR race in a hurricane.  Which is fitting as we passed by Bristol Motor Speedway on the way here.
And so I’m up at 4:30 a.m. feeling oddly rested, searching and pecking with my fat middle aged fingers on this little I-phone to make a journal entry.  This will be my last “preparation” journal entry.  The rest should have a mileage attached.
I read an interesting article by “Groot on the Trail” on The Trek blog last night.  It was written by a hiker from Grafton, West Virginia, near my hometown.  He is starting his AT journey here today too.  I sure hope to meet him.

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584186,"My bro and I woke up and had a good breakfast at the lodge. We then went to the check-in station where I signed in as hiker number 846. My pack weighed in at about 38 pounds which is heavier than I wanted (I added some last minute items before I left the house).
There was a large contingent of hikers gathered at the arch area so we waited our turn to snap the obligatory start photos.  My brother and I said our goodbyes and just like that I was on the trail.  
I started out with a group that included the guy from near my hometown who is nearly 20 years younger than I.  He carries a large Groot doll on the back of his pack facing the rear.  I’m not sure about the symbolism but I’m sure there is meaning there.  I think he has a blog, “Groot on the Trail.”  Regardless, it is bound to become an iconic sight by the time his hike is finished.
Groot’s pack weighed in at a whopping 52 pounds, so I didn’t feel too bad about my weight until the first few hundred feet into the hike when my hips started burning and my foot went numb.
I stopped at a picnic shelter below the falls and took off my knee brace and made some pack adjustments.
Soon thereafter, a cruel and disheartening initiation awaited.  There are over 600 steps to the top of Amicalola Falls.  Climbing those steps with a fully loaded backpack is an insane exercise in stupidity. 
Had I known the extent of the exertion required, I would have taken the alternate route from the lodge.  I thought I would black out a few times as my cardio system adjusted.  I had to stop to rest at every other landing, and to make matters worse, fit tourists of every age, gender, and nationality, including little children, raced up and down the steep incline seemingly like monkeys on crack-cocaine.  It was humiliating, but I made it.  
At the top of the falls a hiker from the Netherlands asked to use my phone to contact his missing mate as his phone was out of charge.  I was happy to oblige.    He was on my phone for at least 20 minutes pecking keys and I wondered if he were stealing information.  Finally he gave my phone back and after a short conversation I was hiking alone into the wild.
The trail was pretty and my pace was brisk. The quiet of the woods was amazing.  I passed a site where an airplane once crashed. Richard Fowler Shoolbred, Sr died there along with three others on April 10th, 1968.  A plaque was erected there in 1996 upon removal of the wreckage.
The pleasant weather turned to rain in early afternoon, and though my intent was to make Springer Mountain that day, after some debate with a young hiker I met up with, common sense told us to stop short at Black Gap Shelter while it was still empty.  We knew Springer Mountain Shelter would be loaded.
After a snack I filtered some water by a stream, fiddled with my pack and set up my sleeping area.  My first trail meal was Mountain House Beef Strogenoff.  By dark we were packed seven or eight tight like a can of sardines. 
The main entertainment was the energetic and extremely chatty young veteran I arrived with.  If I had half his enthusiasm and wit, the world would be my oyster.  
Another interesting fellow in the shelter was Mr. Clean, an Air Force flight school trainee obsessive about hygiene and cleanliness on the trail.  He thru-hiked the entire AT last year and was on a weekend jaunt.  He was a wealth of information.
There was a nice talkative guy about my age from New Orleans whom I apparently had a snoring contest with during the night.
The lone female was Fuscia, a pink haired 20 year old self proclaimed civil-rights activist from Ohio.
I set my watch an hour ahead to accommodate daylight savings time, and with the shelter wall on one side and my new friend from West Virginia on the other side, I had the worst night’s sleep of my life.","Amicalola Falls State Park Approach Trail

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584188,"It is exhausting to sleep in such close quarters in an open shelter trying not to disturb anyone.  I generally flip around and toss and turn all night because my arm goes numb.  I can’t sleep on my back because I get arithmea and heart palpations. And most disconcerting, is my that my small half-century old bladder doesn’t hold liquid like it used to, so I’m usually up several times a night to pee.
After what seemed like an eternity, before dawn I stumbled to the privy (a primitive outhouse) in near total darkness and in a cold light rain.  I had the red light on my headlamp in accordance with trail etiquette as not to disturb the other campers.  Number one and number two happened and that was the highlight of my day to come.
I was the last of my shelter group to leave that morning as I fumbled with organizing my exploded pack.  Experienced hikers pack their gear quickly.  I’m not there yet. 
After a mile-and-a-half hike on a wet muddy morning, I arrived alone at Springer Mountain where the Appalachian Trail officially begins.  I had the place to myself, kissed the plaque and took some video even though the views were obscured by heavy mist and fog.  
I was soon joined by an older gentleman from Massachusetts.  He retired early to hike the Appalachian Trail.  We took photos of one another next to the monument and signed the register.  We hiked together for a spell and it became apparent I couldn’t keep pace with the tall fellow so I told Daddy Longlegs (my private trail name for him) in his wide brimmed safari hat to go on ahead and we would meet up later at the campsite.  
Despite the rain, the hike was very pretty and meandered through groves of rhododendron, through tunnels of green, and crossed many gurgling streams.  Me an “Nawlins” (the guy from New Orleans) played leapfrog the better half of the day.  He told me if I insisted on calling him “New Orleans” I’d have to use the proper pronunciation “Nawlins.”
At Three Forks, I ran into a trail volunteer whom I’d met the previous day on the approach trail.  He told me not to skip an upcoming short side trail to Long Creek Falls as it would be worth my time.
On the way, I discovered a lesser falls that I had thought was Long falls.  It was so serene that I lingered for a snack break at the top of the falls about a foot away from where it crested.  I then climbed down the rocks to its base and discovered Eden.  The 20 foot falls plunged into a sparkling clear pool of shallow bathing water surrounded by sand that looked like spilled jewels, and a rhododendron canopy.  Later I found the real Long Creek Falls which was even more spectacular.
Late in the day in a steady rain, I pitched my tent at Hawk Mountain Campsite.  Daddy Longlegs, Nawlins, Groot (from W.Va.), and Fusia were already at the campsite and set up.  I got the last available tent spot which was right next to the bear box.
The night was cold, wet, and extremely uncomfortable.  In fact, it was downright miserable and claustrophobic. 
Sometime during the night I heard heavy machine gun fire close by.  It went on for about fifteen or twenty minutes.  My first thoughts as I lay shivering were that somebody gunned down all the hikers in the main shelter and that we in the campsite were next.  Then I remembered Mr. Clean telling us that there was a military installation near Hawk Mountain.  Still, not a cool stunt to pull in the middle of the night near the Appalachian Trail. 
I had my first serious thoughts of quitting the trail that night on Hawk Mountain.","Black Gap

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584197,"My freezing caboose awoke to a snow and sleet covered tent. I banged on the sides to get the snow off while gathering the courage to break everything down in the freezing muddy mess outside. 
A trail maintainer stopped at the bear box with a group of new trail-runners, presumably in training, early in the morning just as I was beating the inside of the tent.  So at least I woke up to cheers and applause.  
I thought to myself, “My God, what’s wrong with these people dressed up in parkas and out here with picks and shovels in the middle of the forest this early in the morning in near blizzard conditions!” And half of them were females at that... and cheerful!  It’s a strange world we live in folks.
The trail maintainer said it would be a good day to zero down in my tent as temperatures were dropping rapidly and trail conditions were deteriorating.  I told him I’d think about it.  Apparently nobody heeded his advice.
Naturally I was the last out of camp that morning.  My fingers froze to the point they had no feeling or dexterity which made it nearly impossible to pack my gear.  I donned my pack and wet gloves and off I went.The weather on the other side of the mountain was cold, but not nearly as snow covered.
After a fer piece, I encountered a group of rather elderly day hikers going southbound.  They had no packs but were very friendly and appeared to be hiking with their elderly wives. They asked me were I was from and took my picture which will be posted on the Hiking South website, roll-call page.  A hearty bunch these ATers are!
Up the trail I saw military vehicles flying about on a dirt road which confirmed that some sort of exercise was taking place.  Had I missed something in the news the three days I’d been gone?
The sun came out in the afternoon which made for the trail’s first enjoyable views, but it was a treacherous route up Sassafras Mountain. 
It was cold, but comparatively pleasant the rest of the way to Gooch Mountain, much of it a blurr.  I was offered a spot in the shelter’s loft but declined remembering my bladder’s preference for the nightlife. Climbing up and down a ladder in the black of night might not be the wisest choice for me.
So I set up tent in a designated spot under a thicket of Laurel, and then cooked my noodles at the crowded shelter table.  One hiker was painting a water-color portrait of Fuscia in a sketchbook she brought along.  It was a perfect likeness.
I had a good conversation with a 68 year old retired school teacher from Georgia who was also a coach.  He had followed his daughter by car the previous year while she hiked the entirety of the trail. This time it was his turn, but his wife didn’t want him to attempt the hike even though he appeared to be in incredible shape.  It made me feel lucky to have a supportive wife.  But then again, I don’t know if she would be so supportive at age 68!
There was a Trail Ambassador at camp that evening.  He was a hearty older man in his seventies who smoked a pipe.  His white beard, deep voice, and black knit cap reminded me of an old sailor.  He was pleasant to talk to, and a wealth of information.
I also spoke with Daddy Longlegs for a spell, and as the sky grew dim I priveyed and went to my tent shivering.  
I actually had one bar on my cell phone and was able to speak to my trail boss and boss in general - my dear wife (Sugar Bear).  That was the first decent night’s sleep I had on the trail... relatively speaking of course.","Hawk Mountain

I met a hiker from England with a thick Scottish accent on the rocky outcrop. We had an enjoyable chat about English author, Bill Bryson’s work (A Walk in the Woods), and his own hiking excursions through Scotland, of which he implored me and my wife to visit.
It was all downhill from there, both literally and figuratively.  It got much colder, the blisters on my feet were getting worse by the yard, and fatigue was setting in.  
One awesome surprise, however, was Trail Magic set up at Woody Gap.  There, the sun was shining and a kind middle aged man set up a table with food and beverages.  There was a campfire with chairs set up to warm by (chairs are items we all take for granted), and a delicious pot of goulash - all free for any hiker who wanted to partake.   And I did.
By the time I made it to Lance Creek, all the tent sites were occupied and I had to scrape off an uneven wet place by a creek, off to the side of the camp trail.  If a rain came, I’d surely be washed down the hill in my miniature nylon Noah’s Ark.
Lance Creek is the last stop before the infamous Blood Mountain.  People camp here because bear canisters are required on Blood Mountain.  Hardly anyone opts to carry their food in a bulky bear canister.
One very nice gender neutral fellow who was a Marylin Manson look-alike, with every sort of body piercing imaginable (from my home state), packed in a six of Scottish beer. He offered, and it was a hard decline for me, but in this cold weather and with my tightening bladder, I thought it best to abstain.
This fellow was one of the nicest and most polite personalities I’d met on the trail to date. Best not judge a book by its cover.
Within a couple hours there was a tenement city built - tents and hammocks spaced about a foot apart.  I was in the middle of a raucous bunch of humans, the type that were erased once in history by a worldwide flood.  They had filthy vocabularies and various artificial forms of dealing with the cold, all of which I have no desire to partake in.  It was like being in the inner city in the middle of the Chatahoochie National Forest. 
Bare trees made it nearly impossible to find a private place to poo on the hillside megalopolis.  But after a good hike around the bend, I dug my first cat-hole and let her rip.  The hole wasn’t deep enough because the ground was frozen.  So I covered the fertilizer with a big flat rock, white toilet paper peeking out the sides.
Later as I went to hang my bear bag, I encountered a group of strolling minstrels, the pink clad Fuchia among them.  The group of five were were walking the camp trail singing to the tunes of a ukulele that was packed in by a bearded hiker with dreadlocks.  Strangely, the group stopped and serenaded all the hanging food bags on the camp bear lines.  I have to say that the folk songs were very well played and it was all quite entertaining. 
Later, I passed by my neighbor sitting on a log burning and inhaling something he held cupped in his hands.  I nodded and said goodnight, and he squeaked back the same with lungs full of who knows what.
It was a cold miserable night.  I buried myself so far down in my sleeping that I looked like a tennis ball in the bottom of a tube sock.  To make matters worse, I smelled like a geriatric patient in a second rate nursing home.","Gooch Mountain

I tried to pack up early in order to cross cantankerous Blood Mountain and to make it to the famous Mountain Crossings Outfitters at Neel’s Gap on the other side.  The trail actually goes through the historic building.  I plan on quitting my hike there.  
Neel’s Gap was my minimum goal.  If My body decided I could go further, my plan was to go to the North Carolina border.  From there, Fontana Dam, The Smokey’s, etc., etc..  But it feels like my body and mind is telling me it’s time to go home.  And I miss Sugar Bear something fierce.
My brother sent me some information on Blood Mountain:
There are various theories on the origin of the mountain's name. Some believe that the name of the mountain comes from a bloody battle between the Cherokee and Creek Indians.  Some people believe that it got its name from the reddish color of the lichen and Catawba growing near the summit.
The mountain drew media attention in January 2008 when 24-year-old hiker Meredith Emerson went missing from a nearby trail. Her body was later recovered some distance away. Authorities arrested Gary Hilton on charges of murdering Emerson.  On January 31, Hilton pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.
The ascent up Blood Mountain is ridiculous.  I lost count of the false summits.  You see one summit and think you are finally there, then you’d see another summit way way up yonder and wonder how in the heck you are supposed to make it there in days, let alone in hours.  Disappointment struck again and again until the very end of the climb.  
My pace slowed to heel-to-toe intervals.  My body ached.  My blisters on fire.  I can’t count how many times I cursed my Lord for making such a foolish brain.
Mentally, I was in agony.  A couple times I felt like collapsing right there in the bitter cold and driving wind, and wondered if I’d make it out of there alive.  The Appalachian Trail is no joke for the unprepared.
God sent experienced hikers to pass me at just the right times with encouraging words.  
During much of the ascent, an older rugged hiker was just out of sight before me.  Sometimes I would catch a glimpse of him sitting on a rock or a log above me as if he were waiting for me to follow.  When I’d see him, he’d get up and climb the trail out of site again.  A couple times we actually sat together in near silence.  Then he’d get up again and say, I’ll see you at the top.
I’m not a very religious man but I’m a believer in something that resembles Christianity, In fact, I do consider myself a Christian.  But I don’t always agree with the way it is presented.
However, I couldn’t help but to draw the comparison of my interpretation of Christ.  It’s not always easy to follow Him, but he’ll always wait to lead you up the right path.  And that is the path that leads to Glory.  That’s just the way my logic works.
That older fellow was camped near my tent in the wilderness amongst the “heathen” back at Lang Creek the previous night.  He never said a word and kept to himself the whole time, but there was something comforting about his presence. 
It is fitting that we summited a mountain called Blood together.  In fact, we barely spoke once up top with the most breathtaking views I could have imagined before us.
If you squinted really hard, you could see the Atlanta skyline in the farthest distance.  Surprisingly, Atlanta is the highest major city in the east.  
My Jesus, standing on a rock before me, whipped out a cell phone, took a photo, and called someone, presumably his wife or a friend.  I heard him speak in a New England accent about Blood Mountain being the most difficult climb he has ever hiked.  Then he donned his old pack and disappeared into a thicket of Catawba. 
The descent of Blood mountain was nearly as hard as the ascent.  I almost lost the trail through huge piles of boulders.  I’d eventually find a white blaze painted on a rock that kept me traveling in the right direction. 
Near the bottom I passed by Balancing Rock, and finally rolled into Neel’s Gap and Mountain Crossings where I told Groot that I was quitting.  I travelled one mile per hour on this day and was entirely spent.
I called a ride to Misty Mountain Cabins planning to take a zero day, and then on to Blairsville where I can rent a car tomorrow and head home.  I forgot to throw my boots up into the quitting tree at Neel’s Gap though.","Lance Creek

This is a great place to rest.  There are several well maintained cabins surrounding a pretty farmhouse. It is apparent that this place is well loved and cared for.  
They picked me up at Mountain Crossings, did my laundry for a small fee, and took me to the store to redupply.  I’m grateful and highly recommend Misty Mountain Inn and Cabins.
I’ve changed my mind about quitting the hike.  I’m going to try now for Hiswassee, Georgia.  
I feel somewhat refreshed and caught a ride to resupply my food at Dollar General this morning. 
The majority of the day was used to update my Trail Journal.  I also cleaned some of my gear.  Yesterday the Inn Keeper washed my clothes for $5.00.
Tomorrow morning the proprietor will drop me off back at Mountain crossings where I’ll try to get some different insoles and some vitamin I (ibruprofen).  
I’m also sending home my camp pants and shirt, hiking umbrella, journal, and ace bandage, in order to reduce my pack weight.

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584345,"I shuttled back to the trailhead at Neel’s Gap from Misty Mountain Inn with three other fellows in their 60’s. 
They told of a hiker they encountered that was walking with a pair of sandals through the snow and freezing weather.  He had no food, and a swastika tattooed on his forehead like Charles Manson.  Apparently the authorities came and got him.  
I also heard a tale of a man who recently lived in an AT shelter locally for two weeks.  He was quite OCD about the place and kept it spotless.  He even wiped out the bear box daily with baby wipes to keep it sparkling clean.
At the outfitters, I mailed a small box of items back home, basically enough to half fill a Walmart bag.  The fee for them to put the plastic bag into a used box and seal it up (all of 15 seconds work) and to ship it home was probably four times what it would cost at the post office.  The clever little attendant said with a sadistic grin, that my other options were to hitchhike to town and send it through the post office, or put the gear into the hiker’s box for donation.  
Then I went to the other side of the store to get some new insoles because the pricy ones I started with were shredding my feet.  The young fellow helping me gave me three expensive pairs to try.  None of them felt like they were much better than the ones I had.  He said my only other option was to hitch a ride to Walmart in the next town and get a cheap pair.  And so I chose the least bad expensive pair they had for my feet.
I picked up an extra lighter and some Advil packets.  Then I went to the register, turned around, bent over, and let the checkout clerk spank my already chaffed behind as I handed him my credit card.
And so with severely blistered feet and a chapped ass, I walked past the Quitting Tree and through the Walayesi breezeway, of which the AT runs through, and continued my walk in the woods.
I stopped to briefly chat with Turtle, a hiker about my age from Kentucky who got his trail name because of his hiking speed (similar to my own speed).  
At the top of the ridge I came across a Gnome fairy village neatly placed under a tree.  I smiled, snapped a picture and moved on.
Later, I hiked a small piece with Tugboat, a 68 year old hiker from around Allentown.  I found a brand new expensive pair of gloves on the trail as we were hiking and gave them to Tugboat because he felt sure he knew whom they belonged to.  
Later, I met up with a retired Mail Carrier from Clearwater Beach (where my brother lives). His first words to me were, “Did you happen to find a pair of gloves back there?”
“Yes, I sure did.  Almost stepped on those fancy things. Tugboat has them.”
Relief swept across his face, “They really put it to me at the outfitters.  Those dang things cost a fortune.”
“I know exactly what you mean!”
Tugboat caught up to us as we took a break at Tesnatee Gap where owner and gloves were reunited.
I hit it off real well with the chatty fellow from the Sunshine State (I can’t recall his name), and we hiked together for quite a long piece. We got our picture taken overlooking Wildcat Mountain.  
There are no guard rails on the AT, but their should be.  As I was making room for a southbound group of hikers, the earth gave way at the top of a steep ravine. I jammed my trekking pole between some rocks as I fell backwards and grabbed a sapling that kept me from tumbling down the cliff like a wildly bouncing tire pushed from atop the Grand Canyon.  The end of my trekking pole looked like a C but it surely saved me from serious injury.
Good conversation made the miles slip by as we shared our life stories in a relatively short period of time.  We discussed staying together as a group, waiting for Tugboat and Turtle, and perhaps sharing lodging expenses.  I liked that idea a lot because they were my kind of people.
However, when we came to the next shelter, I felt the urge to move on and pick up some more miles for the day.  I had Hiawassee on the brain and hoped to see my Mountaineer play on TV in the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.
During our walk before separating, we stopped to converse with a man briskly day hiking with his dog.  He was close to seventy and appeared to be in terrific condition.  He spoke with an Italian accent and told us he lived in the area.  He used to serve in the military special forces but these days he and his dog hike several miles each day.  
One day many years ago while hiking on Blood Mountain, he slipped and fell on a patch of ice.  He was paralyzed from the neck down and the doctors told him he would never walk again.  Since then, he has hiked the Appalachian Trail three times.  He said hiking has regenerated his spine and he’s not about to give it up now as his aging body is starting to loose mass.  He and his dog have hiked nearly 14,000 miles together.  Their new goal is 20,000 miles. 
I stumbled into the Low Gap campsite alone after a splendid but exhausting day of hiking.  I did nearly 12 miles, by far the most miles to date.  I already missed my new friend who’s name I never got (or forgot).  
I pitched my tent, filtered some water in a stream, exploded my pack inside my tent, set up my air mattress, cooked some mashed potatoes with olive oil and Vienna sausages, hung my bear bag, called my honey, talked to my brother-in-law, foot care, personal hygiene...and then slept less bad than I have since I started hiking the AT.","Neel’s Gap

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584349,"On this St. Patricks day I awoke from a semi-restful sleep and packed up in record time, two hours. It rained a little during the night, just enough to make my tent and the ground wet.
I donned my lime green backpack, green hiking shirt, and green cap, and started walking a little before 9:00 a.m.. 
The entire morning was spent hiking in a mystical mountain mist that seemed to have restorative properties.  I walked through several long stretches of green tunnel created by groves of mountain laurel and rhododendron.  
It rained briefly, just enough to prompt me to don my green rain suit and green pack cover.  Saint Patrick gave me a run for my money on green today.
In early afternoon as I approached the top of a wooded mountain, the sun started peeking through and I could actually see the mist rolling up the wooded hillside towards the light.  
The last half of the day was spent scrambling through rocky, boulder strewn terrain.  There was one difficult area where I had to cross a huge stretch of boulders reminiscent of the pile below Mount Rushmore. 
It was like the gods hired thousands and thousands of quarry dump trucks to go to the top of the mountain and dump their payloads over the side.  
The difference though, was that the area was also wooded, and there was this remarkable, no stunning, emerald green mossy fungi covering the entire area.  It was an extraordinary site to behold on this Lucky day.
My goal was to reach Unicoi Gap and then decide on my next move.  The name ""Unicoi"" comes from the Cherokee word  (unega), which means ""white."" It refers to the low-lying clouds and fog that often drape the Southern Appalachian mountains in the early morning or on humid or moist days. The name ""Unaka""— which historically refers to the mountains along the Tennessee/North Carolina border— has the same root as ""Unicoi.
I was quite pleased to make it into Unicoi Gap, where, low on food, I shuttled into Hiawassee, Georgia, a cute little town on Chatuge Lake, for what is bound to be another zero day, not only due to my feet, but to also watch WVU and in-state rival Marshall, play each other tomorrow in the second round of March Madness.  
My only concern is that Marshall’s color is green.","Low Gap

I’d love to to the same, but there is no way I could hike 17 miles over rough terrain in one day at this point.  To be caught in the woods with no gear at night would be suicide.
The hotel had one washer and dryer available to guests, so I stood in line, in the buff underneath my rain gear, for over an hour to wash my stinky cloths.  
Later I took a stroll through town (as if I hadn’t done enough walking already) and ate a chicken dinner at a local diner for all of five bucks plus a tip.
When I checked into the Holiday Inn Express earlier, The had “Deuling Banjos” playing on the sound system in the lobby.  Hiawassee is where the film Deliverance was filmed.  It’s nice to know that I’m hiking alone through these woods...and I do wonder if the local Chamber of Commerce knows about the Holiday Inn playing the Deliverance theme song in their lobby.
As I walked back to my hotel after dinner I noticed a funny looking bank of clouds rolling in as the sun set.  When I got to my room, I received word that an extreme tornado warning had been issued.  Life on the AT.

At the top of the climb I was elated to see Turtle and Tugboat at their camp.  We caught up, but nobody has seen Dean, the retired mail carrier from Clearwater since I left him waiting for Tugboat at Whitley Gap shelter trailhead three days ago.  
Later, just as I snapped a photo of Rocky Mountain, I met trail legend, Squatch, who has been hiking southbound through the winter from Maine. 
Doc and Tinkles told me about him before I left for the trail.  They didn’t know he was still hiking.  In fact, Doc gave him his trail name several months earlier as he and his wife were finishing up thier NOBO thru hike last year.  He hikes mostly primitive, picking things up in hiker boxes along the way, and he peculiarly wears a loin cloth (to prevent chaffing) most of the time.  He’s was a pleasure to talk to and a great motivator.  Lots of advice.
It rained on an off all day.  Fog was thick so no views.  Stopped at Tray Mountain Shelter during a downpour along with several other people.  As I left, Turtle and Tugboat rolled in to spend the night, and so did my Jesus from Blood Mountain.

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584741,"Staying in a hostel reminded me of the military.  Several people to a room sleeping in bunks, strategically maneuvering to get showers and toilet time as quickly as possible, while also jockeying position to get phones charged at one of the scarce wall outlets. 
It is loud in the evening as the mostly younger sect plays board games and laughs hysterically at each joke cracked, funny or not.
A chorus of snoring, and us older guys with aged bladders climbing up and down our bunks through the night, made sleeping an iffy affair.  
Everybody is up before dawn packing up their gear focused intently on the mission ahead.  Then it’s all-you-can-eat cereal before the shuttles leaves for the trailhead.
This day rudely welcomed me and the others with snow, wind, and ice, the tail end of a nor’easter that was wracking the eastern seaboard.  At the last minute I opted out of taking the first shuttle and decided to quit my hike.
As Dean and I were talking the night before, we both came to the conclusion that none of this was fun.  The bad weather, the constant packing and unpacking, the crowded campsites, the endless rollercoaster of ascents and descents over rock and root strewn terrain with all your gear strapped to your back.  Up to this point it all pretty well sucked, at least for us.
For me, it feels like a mad race to the next shelter in which you keep falling further and further behind.  Experienced, faster hikers get the prize of shelter and not having to set up tents and hammocks in the cold wet muck and snow; and the older, slower, or less experienced hikers get the shaft.  It's like a bad dream where no matter how hard you try, you can’t keep up with the pack... and then leaving the ones you like behind because they hike slower.  In my brief and laughable experience as a biker, the dynamic was the opposite.  Inexperienced bikers in a group always led pack, while seasoned bikers took position in the rear keeping a watchful eye on newbies.
However, I do understand that driven people have goals.  Hiking is an individual sport.  I too have left slower hikers behind because I wanted to make my goal for the day.   
The mental challenge is every bit as real as the physical challenge when you hike alone.  The cold is colder and dangers are more real.  It also feels as if I’m not fitting in very well socially with our bubble.  Very few, including me, are not taking time to smell the roses - roses of which seem few and far between, and take tremendous effort to reach.  Had the hike started in better weather conditions I'm sure my experience would be somewhat different. 
I asked a trail circuit chaplain at the hostel if she knew how I could get to a rental car outlet.  She said she would take me (but clearly didn’t want to, as the closest was thirty miles away).  Then after chatting a while, and with staff encouragement, I decided to brave the cold and snow and tackle the next few days of four and five thousand foot elevations in the bad weather ahead.
The chaplain's prayer was answered on this date as I had an excellent hiking day.  I passed the Georgia/North Carolina border, and the famous twisted oak, albeit in high winds and snow.
The suck began when I stumbled into Muskrat Shelter campsite.  The shelter was, as usual, jammed with mostly younger faster, and irritatingly loud hikers.  The temps were dropping rapidly and it was snowing very hard.  So I found a spot to pitch my tent on a bed of cold white fluff, and with my fingers numb, my water frozen, and clothing drenched in the sweat of unventilated layers.  I forwent cooking and snacked on a protein bar for dinner.  It appears that I couldn’t have cooked anyway because my new Jetboil stove was missing.  I laid it out on my bunk the night before at the hostel and that’s the last I saw of it.  
After my frozen snack at Muskrat early that evening, I laid in my sleeping bag for the next 12 hours trying to stay warm enough to survive.  I layered with everything I had.  T-shirt and undies, base layer long-johns and top, fleece jacket and hiking pants, puffy jacket, and rain suit.  Socks on my hands because my gloves were wet.  And this was the first day of Spring.At one point during the night when my frozen fingers would allow it, with one spotty bar showing, I texted my wife to pray and set the phone outside my sleeping bag hoping the text would eventually catch an airwave.  It did...and she prayed.","Dick’s Creek Gap

The snow from the previous day clung to the tree branches as thick ice crystals that made the scene look like a Christmas fairytale.  The natural beauty of it all literally took my breath away as clear blue skies welcomed the day.
The only food I had was the kind that has to be cooked (dry noodles and rice), and my stove is missing.  I'm not the type to make accusations, but yes, it was stolen at the hostel.  There's no other way it could have come up missing unless someone ""accidentally"" reached up to the top bunk and ""mistakenly"" placed it into their pack while I was out of the room.  It was fitted tightly into a bright orange nylon stuff sack with my phone number and a flying WV symbol written on it with permanent marker.  The sack also contained a titanium spoon and a dark green collapsable coffee cup.  So, If anyone in my hiking bubble sees a nice Jetboil stove out there with a rare green forest print cozy, tell them I surely appreciate their kindness in taking care of it for me, and if so inclined, they can text me at the number marked, and I will give them an address to which they can return the item to me when they are finished with it...no reprimands and no questions asked whatsoever.  Complete forgiveness.
The morning was very beautiful and the hiking pleasant.  I passed a Ranger who asked me how I was doing.  I told him I was here, but had a rough night.  His reply, ""Well, you know what they say;  If you made it through Georgia, you can make it to Maine.""  
I followed a black Santa with a red stocking cap using a decorated holiday staff for a hiking stick, down into Deep Gap, at the terminus of a dirt forest service road.  I dropped my pack to take a rest by a huge tree across from where Black Sants and his partner sat.  After a pause, I looked up the steep incline of the onward trail.  The climb would be to Standing Indian Mountain at nearly 5,500 feet in elevation.  My mind entered calculating mode and I had several concerns.  
First,  I have two or three days hiking ahead before civilization, much of it above 5000 feet.  Second, The forecast is for more rain, snow, ice, wind, and bad weather in general.   Third, I have no way to cook the dehydrated food I have.  Fourth, even if I wanted to exit the trail here, there is no cell phone service to contact a ride.  How am I going to pull this off? 
So, as Black Santa set out into a nearby wooded area, cat-hole trowel and toilet paper in hand, I decided to filter some water at a nearby stream, eat my last dry tortilla (I mistakenly brought the kind that supposed to be cooked) with my last few pepperoni slices, and sat under the tree to mull things over.
Within a few moments a van showed up.  It was driven by a trail club volunteer who was offering free rides into the town of Franklin.  I seized the opportunity, and on the long road out of the hollow, the driver picked up two hikers recently graduated from high-school.  A little further on, an attractive middle aged woman hiking alone got into the van.
On the drive into town, the woman hiker told all about her Swedish made hiking skirt, the scholarly endeavors of herself and her Italian professor husband, about her hiking journeys through the Alps, and about her pending move to Tuscany.  It was all quite interesting and I thought how nice it must be to live suckling on the sweet teet of elite academia.
The driver dropped me and the worldly lady off at a cheap hotel.  After I offered the driver a donation, the default gentleman in me offered to take the lady’s pack out of the back of the van for her, a gesture she seemed most ungrateful for.  At the front desk, the woman made it absolutely, abundantly clear to the clerk that “He and I are not together in any way.”   
My jaw dropped realizing that she thought, since I lifted her pack out of the van for her, that this smelly old unshaven hiker from West-By-God Virginia wearing a cheap silver wedding band from Walmart Mart, must have the intention hitting on her.  It seemed her perception was that I was weakened by the temptation of her international charm.  Indeed she thought that I must certainly be contemplating sharing a room.  
I confirmed to both her and the clerk that we certainly were not together, that she was far too old for my taste, and that I would be lodging alone.

I was still very torn on whether I should leave the trail.  Could one more day of rest give me the fortitude to continue?  With the weather forecast dismal for nearly a week out, it wasn’t until my rental car was delivered that I confirmed my decision, and then still it wasn’t final.
I decided to take the scenic route home and yellow blaze some AT highlights along the way.  My first stop was Wayah Bald.  I had promised a staff member back at Top of Georgia Hostel that before I quit, I would drive up to that mountaintop and contemplate the situation with the 360 degree view of beautiful mountains and valleys.  A forest fire touched there a couple years ago that burned the roof of the observation platform.  It has since been replaced and looks brand new.  The views were stunning as hikers trickled in and out of the viewing area. 
I spoke to an elderly local couple who had driven up through the snow covered forest road to enjoy the scenery.  They said it had been several years since they’ve had such wild wintery weather in March.  Last year it was unseasonably warm.
As I drove back to the entrance of the forest service road, I stopped for a few minutes and wondered if I should turn left and go back to Franklin, wait out the weather to continue hiking, or turn right and continue the scenic route home.  My answer came with a text from a relative that said, “Time to come home.  We are worried about your safety.”
And so I turned right and drove through some of the prettiest forest in the eastern United States.  The Nantahela River Gorge is home to World Championship kayak competitions.  The AT crosses the river at the Nantahela Outdoor Center (NOC), where hikers can bunk in a hostel, take raft trips, and load up on food at the restaurant which overlooks a professional kayak course on the river.  I ate a juicy Cajun style burger there for lunch and visited the outfitters where I considered replacing my missing stove. 
From there, I took my rented car on a wild ride through the Tail of the Dragon, a section of U.S. Route 129 with three hundred eighteen curves bordering the Great Smokey Mountains and Cherokee National Forest…with no guardrails!  In some places, photographers were set up and took pictures of every car and motorcycle attempting the route.  Banners told where each person could go online and purchase a photo of themselves driving their sports car or motorcycle down the famous stretch of potential doom.  I decided that my rented Kia Soul careening through a curve would not be an impressive man-cave wall-hanger.
After that I took a left onto the Smokey Mountain Foothills Parkway where the views reflected the mountain range’s namesake, as great pillows of smokey fluff laid in valleys topped by steep forested peaks.  The drive was reminiscent of Ronnie Millsap’s song, “Smokey Mountain Rain.”  I ended the day unexpectedly in the tourist Mecca of Pigeon Forge where I shacked up in a motel behind the Elvis Museum and watched my Mountaineers loose to Villanova in the Sweet Sixteen.
After a good night’s sleep and a filling continental breakfast, I couldn’t wait to get out of the tourist area.  Detouring the heart of Gatlinburg I got lost on a windy east Tennessee backroad intending to visit Hot Springs, a trail town in which the AT runs right down the middle of Main Street.   However, I was diverted by my faulty inner compass to I-81, where my new destination was Damascus, Virginia, the home of Trail Days - the famous AT festival that takes place in May of each year.  I was thinking about possibly turning in my rental car and picking up the trail there since the weather is generally a little milder and the trail becomes easier to hike.  However, that plan was thwarted by a blizzard… Yes, a blizzard. 
And so I set my course home through inclement weather and arrived back at my house early evening in a fashion that to my surprise wasn’t nearly as hospitable as I had hoped.  When the wife works long hard days and you've been playing in the woods for two weeks... Well, you get the picture.  It never fails.  Like football weekends in the fall, no matter how excited you may be, there is always rain on that parade.  
As soon as my pack hit the floor negotiations began;  talk of retirement savings, talk of unfinished projects, talk of what is expected in a traditional marriage, talk of returning the favor, talk of...blah, blah, blah...  And... ""Somebody has to be an adult around here!""  But absolutely no talk of the AT which is forbidden since that's all I've talked about for months.  After spending a small fortune on equipment and focusing my existence on that one thing for many more weeks than I was actually on trail, you can't blame her for being a little miffed.  She  had contemplated sending me back out there to get my money's worth.  I miss the trail already.   
Most assuredly all are valid points coming from the perspectives of ""normal"" society and even of fundamental southern religion.  We work the best years of our lives, often in jobs that deplete our souls, in order to retire when we are too old to enjoy it or too cynical to appreciate the freedom.  And then after a while we die broke after an obligatory stint in a nursing home that digests the rest of the savings that we gave our souls to earn in the first place.  And that is called living a responsible life.  
All of our days we worry about the dark monsters of health insurance and net worth.  Everyone wants guarantees.  It seems increasingly evident that our system of values is all about tomorrow, and none of it is about today.  It is a mindset that is very good for business, but it is terrible for the soul.  Even as we approach wonderful and unheard of financial security by yesterday's standards, tomorrows standards always loom.  And so enough is never enough.  
Of course, there are versions of circumstance that are far more light imbued.  And those circumstances are usually followed by scary leaps of faith.  Some of those leaps fail, and so it takes courage to make those leaps.  I believe that leaps are what faith is all about.  
Leaps of faith are defined by the absence of guarantees or pre-conditions.  I hope and pray that everybody important to me takes a leap of faith from time to time with no safety net, just to experience the joy of life the way a our loving God meant it to be lived.  By Faith!
By no means would I ever suggest leaping a chasm without a reasonable amount of research, testing, and preparation - but there comes a time when you have to either take the leap or just stay home and live the status quo.  These days there are so many young couples and families that live out of wedlock because they want guarantees - because they want assurances - because they are afraid of the consequences of failure and the humiliation of divorce.
My life has been defined by leaps of faith.  And yes, the majority of those leaps have resulted in failure.  More times than I can count I have crashed and burned.  But with each so called failure I still get something good out of it, and so the word ""failure"" is a misnomer... even a lie.  Failure is merely what happens when we've miscalculated.  When we try something new and it doesn't work out as planned, we can either try again utilizing the education of our failure (lessons learned), or we can cross that experience off our list of wants.  Either way, we are better for having leaped in the first place.  
So many times, religion tells us that failure is merely the result of sin, and so we tend to beat ourselves up for failing and we believe that because we have fallen short of our goal, that we have fallen out of the favor of God.  Experience has shown me that most failures are NOT a result of sin.  And even though some are, we never ever fall out of God's favor.  Despite faulty interpretations of scripture that benefit the business of church, The Man Upstairs is always rooting for us - He loves us no matter what - and he's constantly urging us to take leaps of faith.         
Meanwhile, I still have about 350 days to complete a Thru-Hike.  I've already hiked nearly 100 miles, only 21 more of those and I'll be done.  Hmmm.","Franklin, NC

Dub V,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585193,"In looking back over my journal entries it seems that I’ve managed to write an entire whiney novel after only two weeks of traveling by foot on the Appalachian trail.  
I walked with a heavier than necessary load strapped to my back for almost 100 miles (95.4 mi.) covering the Georgia section of the AT.  I averaged 8.67 miles per day hiking over steep and difficult terrain, slowed often by unseasonably severe weather conditions.  And I did it with no previous hiking experience, out of shape, and with some minor health issues at 53 years of age.
My original goal for the AT was to hike 100 miles (essentially the Georgia section) before that idea grew to a possible Thru-Hike all the way to Maine.  So, at least the original thought was achieved.  
My top moments on the AT in Georgia are;  1. Hiking the section after Neels Gap and meeting some nice people on that section.  2. Reaching the Summit of Blood Mountain.  3.  Reaching the North Carolina Border.  Honorable mentions; Waterfalls, Mountaintop Views, Starting at Amicalola under the arch.
The worst experiences were;  1.  Overcrowded Lance Creek campsite.  2.  Climbing Blood Mountain in the freezing cold.  3.  Muskrat Campsite in the freezing cold.  Dishonorable mentions;  Overnight at Hawk Mountain campsite (cold and gunfire), Long evenings and nights in crowded camps, The smell of damp down, Trail food.
I can’t express how much the encouraging and thoughtful comments on Trail Journals have meant to me.  Reading those were perhaps the most uplifting moments of the whole experience.
On my wall map, I completed about an inch of three-and-a-half feet of mapped trail from Amicalola Falls to Mt. Khadadin, Maine.  My absolute minimum goal was to make it to Neel’s Gap, nearly 40 miles from Amicalola - I did that.  My next goal was the North Carolina Border - I did that too.  I had hoped however, to be able to make it at least to Fontana Dam, but the weather drove me off the trail at Deep Gap.
I still see Squatch looking me in the eye when I met him on a rock overlooking the mountains, with his special forces training countenance, he asked me where I was going.  I said I hoped to make it to Maine.  And then he told me, “I can tell right now you are never going to make it that far.  Making it to Maine has to be the most important thing in your life if you’re going to get there.  There has to be definiteness of purpose, and that definiteness isn’t in your voice… Now where are you going?”  
I replied that I was going to Maine!  But the definiteness in my mind was not there.  Fear of what lie ahead based on what I experienced behind me prevented me from taking the option of quitting off the table. 
Would I like to pick up where I left off and finish a thru hike to Maine?   The answer is a resounding Yes.  And that still isn’t totally out of the question.  However, there is one thing that is more important than the trail to me right now, and that is my wife.  I think she was more disappointed than me that I didn’t stick with it, and my return to the trail would have to be with her blessing (which is still a possibility).  But first we are going to take a break, get some things done around the house, vacation at the beach for a week, and then we will see a bit more clearly.  It might be more reasonable at this point point that I hike long sections over the next two or three years as circumstances allow it.  But then again there are no guarantees that those circumstances will materialize.
Hiking the AT during peak season in March was definitely not the wilderness experience I thought it would be.  It did get a little better after Neels, Gap, and then it got a little better after Unicoi Gap, and better still after Dick’s Creek Gap.  It seemed that the AT was slowly filtering out annoying and inconsiderate hikers.  If not for the weather I’m sure I would still be on the trail.
I must confess however, that all during my hike, I worried about all the things I could be accomplishing at home in my continuing seven year effort to restore and renovate my civil-war era home.  After all, I am a carpenter more than I am a hiker.  
When I started hiking the AT I wasn’t a hiker at all.  But now I AM a Hiker.  The boot camp of the Georgia section of the AT in an unseasonably harsh month weather-wise, made me a Hiker.  And so now a thirst has been instilled.  Whether it be on the AT, or in my own beautiful state of West Virginia at Dolly Sods or Cranberry Wilderness, or on the Florida Trail, or in the Smokey Mountains, I WILL find the time to hike.  And I sincerely hope that my family and friends can enjoy hiking with me from time to time.
I’ll continue this journal should I be fortunate enough return to the AT as either a Thru-hiker or section hiker.  Until then….Happy Trails!",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Thu",0
