Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591803,"We began the day in Franklin, NC.  The day before, we drove from Raleigh to Franklin so we could get close to Deep Gap - our final destination - where we would meet a shuttle for the trip down to the start of the AT at Springer Mountain, GA.  Deep Gap is the first place you can get off the trail in NC.  The plan is to hike 85 miles from Springer to Deep Gap to complete the GA section of the AT.  We met the shuttle driver at 8 AM at Deep Gap and settled in for the 2 hour drive south.  We started hiking at 10 AM at the parking lot below Springer Mountain. From this parking lot, you have to go south for a mile to get to Springer and then back track that mile as you hike north.  Oh well, we saw that section twice.  We hiked about 9.4 miles (according to a phone app called Strava) and got to the Hawk Mountain Shelter at around 3PM. We were there early enough to secure a spot in the shelter - which was good because we anticipated rain overnight and did not want to tent if we could help it. The weather was great today in spite of the poor forecast.  Tomorrow there is a greater chance of rain than today. Overnight, there was a lot of rain, and we were glad we were not in tents.  Sure makes it difficult to get packed up when the tent is wet.","parking lot below Springer Mountain

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591884,"Started hiking around 8:30 AM.  Today the plan was to go to Gooch Mountain Shelter.  We made it there by early afternoon.  Had thoughts about going further to get ahead of our plan, but the next shelter is about 8 miles further and we really wanted to be in a shelter with rain very likely overnight.  We knew if we did not get there early, we likely would not get a spot.  So we stopped a little early and called the shelter home for the night.  By the end of the day, the shelter was full with about 10 people and there were probably 20 others tenting nearby.  There wasn't too much rain overnight this time, so that was good for the tenters.  We had harder day because there were more climbs. But we are doing well and starting to get our trail legs.  Since we stayed in a shelter today, it means we are definitely tenting tomorrow night. The next shelter is in a 5-mile section where they only allow you to overnight if you have a bear canister (which we don't have).  So, we will have to stop just short of that and tent.  We heard the fine was $5,000 for getting caught camping without a bear canister, so we want no part of that!  One neat thing happened at this shelter.  While people were milling around the shelter, an owl came flying nearby - about 15 feet from where we were all standing - and got a mouse (presumably).  Once the mouse was subdued, dead, or whatever, the owl took off again.  I attempted to get my GoPro out in time to get him on video, but when I got home I did not have it after all.  The one video I really wanted to see....","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592739,"We got started around 8 AM.  We had talked about an earlier start, but it just didn't happen.  There were some tough climbs today, but there was a lot of downhill too.  The most eventful thing that happened today was that my hiking partner, ""Happy Jack"", accidentally shot himself with bear spray when we stopped for a break after about 2 hours of hiking. Apparently, he had taken the safety mechanism off the can because he wanted to be sure he could use it quickly if needed.  As he was taking off his pack to take a break, his pack somehow hit the trigger and sprayed him.  He got it on his pants and shirt - and thigh and abdomen - but he also got it on the handles of both trekking poles and one of his pack straps.  He had to completely strip down right there on the trail and wash up with water and baby wipes we had.  It could have been a lot worse but it was bad enough.  Maybe Happy Jack should now be called ""Bear Spray"".  We got to the campsite around 2 PM.  Our trail friend, Toby from Switzerland (aka ""Toby Wan Canobe""), got there a little earlier than we did and secured a nice campsite we could all three use.  We had a good water source, sheltered campsite, and nearby bear cables for storing our food.  Happy Jack continued to deal with irritation from the bear spray that got on his shoulder, back, thigh, and hands.  He did a lot of flushing with water and used a few more baby wipes, but still he was feeling the heat from the chemicals.  It rained all night, but we stayed dry in our tents.  Fortunately it was not raining when we got up to pack up and leave.  We were thankful for that. Still we had some wet tents and clothes to deal with.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592742,"Well it rained all night - sometimes very hard - and the ground was pretty much saturated.  We hiked all day in the rain.  Most of the time, the rain was not heavy, and the tree canopy kept some of it off of us.  The trail is actually part of the drainage system for the mountains, so we were walking in creek beds that were full of water.  Today we hiked over Blood Mountain which is the highest point on the AT in GA.  It rained all the way up, but then it stopped as we approached the summit only to begin again just after we got off the top.  There is a neat shelter on top of the mountain that would have been nice to stay in, but it was in that area where you had to have a bear canister.  So, we hiked on.  Saw a couple with 2 dogs going up when we were going down.  They were already carrying one dog, had no trekking poles, and were very wet and tired.  We convinced them to turn back because it was not going to be fun trying to make the climb in the rain carrying a dog and having no poles.  They listened.  We got pretty wet today.  We knew our destination was a hostel, so we were hopeful we would not get there and find it full.  We got there early afternoon and found only 2 people there already.  One was Toby and the other was Tom who had through hiked back in 1979 and was now 75 and doing some section hiking.  There was plenty of room for us, so we moved right in and started getting things out to dry.  They had dehumidifiers and fans going, and the combination was very effective in drying our all our wet clothes, etc.  Mountain Crossings is a neat place.  There is a great store for resupplying, and we even were able to get a hot pizza there which was fantastic.  It was one of those Red Baron frozen pizzas, but it was pretty fantastic for hungry hikers like us!  Jack also had to buy some clothes to replace those hit by the bear spray.  The chemical in the spray continued to cause irritation, so the shower at the hostel was timely.  That stuff is nasty!  I called it ""the gift that keeps on giving""...
At this point, we have a weather forecast (which earlier had been hard to get because of poor cell service) and are starting to think about whether we will be able to continue......will it even be safe to do so.  We have already seen lots of trees down on the trail, and with the saturated ground and lots more rain coming, there likely will be more trees falling.  Plus, thunderstorms are in the forecast each day, and we definitely don't want to see any lightning as we cross over these mountain peaks.  We are talking among ourselves and to other hikers on what the best plan might be for moving forward.","Lance Creek Restoration Area Camping Area

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592751,"We planned to get an early start right out of the hostel.  However, even though we were up early (6 AM), it was raining so hard outside that nobody really wanted to get started in all that.  We waited on a band to pass and stop raining before leaving, but shortly thereafter we were right in the middle of a torrential rain again.  We were still thinking about our destination - either stop at Low Gap Shelter or continue on to Poplar Stamp Gap.  The latter would mean tenting - not the best idea.  We decided we would get to Low Gap Shelter and reassess.  Toby said he was going to Low Gap and stay in the shelter due to the weather and that was starting to seem like a good plan with the heavy rain we were hiking in.  Keeping in mind our ultimate goal of continuing all the way to NC, though, we really needed to do a few more miles if we could.  The trail was like creeks all day, and we were pretty wet again.  When we got to Deep Gap, we heard there were some thunderstorms on the way, so we decided we might as well stay there for the night.  Unfortunately, ""the inn was full"".  This is a pretty small shelter - holds about 6.  Was interesting that there were a LOT of trees down around and on the way to this shelter.  The side trail to the shelter was blocked and you had to detour through some campsites to even find the shelter.  When we found out we had to tent, we had a small window of time to get the tents up before the storm would get there.  We actually were in the middle of putting them up when the bottom dropped out.  We just did get inside the tents before it got too bad.  Had to shed the wet clothes and get warm and ride out the storm.  It rained HARD all night long - no let up at all.  I had water splashing under the fly of my tent and it got a little wet inside.  So, before the night was over, my sleeping bag and pad were wet.  Inside the sleeping bag was still dry and warm, and I was thankful.  What a night though.  Torrential rains - nonstop.  There was a little lightning and thunder, but for the most part the thunderstorm was not real close to us.  I slept well, but I knew in the morning it would not be fun to pack up all this wet stuff.  Plus I expected we would be carrying a few more pounds just because everything was wet now.
Being 10 miles or so from Unicoi Gap gave us a spot where we could exit the trail if we wanted to.  We wanted to!  We figured we would give a call tomorrow to a shuttle service and see if we could get off the trail.  Seemed like the prudent thing to do with the forecast for another day or so of heavy rain and everything already wet.","Mountain Crossings and Neel Gap

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592784,"It rained very hard all night long.  Torrential rains.  I had splashing coming in under the rain fly and getting into the tent.  My sleeping bag was wet.  I had hung up my wet shorts overnight inside my tent to see if they would dry.  They got pretty dry except for the very bottoms which I could wring out.  Not too bad putting them on.  It was raining as we took down the tents.  We started packing up around 6 AM, and by 8 AM we were packed up and ready to go.  Everything was wet, so the weight we were carrying increased.  Oh well, it couldn't be helped. The trail was very wet - like hiking in creeks.  All that water that had fallen all night was now draining off the mountains.  It was common to be in ankle deep water or mud on the trail.  At some points, the water flowing across the trail was 20 feet wide, and some places could have been a little dangerous if not being careful.  When we had gone about 5 miles, I made contact with a shuttle driver and asked if they might possibly take us from Unicoi Gap to our car at Deep Gap this afternoon.  To my surprise, he said they could do it this afternoon.  Toby was planning to go to Unicoi Gap and shuttle into Hiawassee and stay in a hotel that night.  We told him we would share a room and split the cost with him.  We had no way to get in touch with him other than email because he has an international phone.  We were not sure he would be checking email, but I did send him an email telling him of our plans.  Another hiker, Pat, was also going to stay with us, and I had his cell number.  I sent him a text to let him know we would not be at the hotel that night.  Never did hear back from either of them.  The last several miles to Unicoi Gap were downhill - uncomfortably so.  We were glad to get to the bottom of the hill and the parking lot where the shuttle driver was to meet us at 3:00 PM.  We got there about 2:40 PM, so we had time to change into dry clothes.  By this time, the rain had stopped.  We got behind a large rock to change.  We got a text later that the driver would be 30 minutes late.  Later found out the reason for this was the the highway had washed out and the road was closed to Unicoi Gap from one direction.  He had to go around to the other side of the mountain to reach us.  Took an extra 30 minutes to get there.  He told us all about the flooding that was underway in Helen, GA.  He said the whole town was shut down.  We rode by a lake on the way to our car, and it was out of its banks.  Docks were under water.  Boats had floated from their moorings.  He kept saying he had never seen water that high there.  Wouldn't you know it that we happened to be in a tent while all that flood water was falling from the sky.  We made it to our car around 4 PM and were about 6 hours +/- from Raleigh.  We got home around midnight after stopping for dinner, gas, and coffee along the way.  Safe end to an eventful hiking trip on the GA section of the AT.","Low Gap Shelter
