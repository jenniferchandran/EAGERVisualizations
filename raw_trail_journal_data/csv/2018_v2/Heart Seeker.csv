Heart Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584551,"it seems as though my first entry never made it here, I will try again.......
Is one ever ready for this journey? Some days I am so ready, others I question, “what am I doing”, “am I crazy?”  
Last May/June I hiked through the Shenandoah mountains, then in Aug/Sept I hiked from Dicks Creek Gap (I had hiked all of Ga a couple of years ago) to Newfound Gap.  During those hikes I longed to stay on the trail. I love being in nature where I feel closer to God. I love how various situations & people are brought to mind that I can pray for. I love the sense of accomplishment I have when I make it through another day....another night. I love the comradery among new people you meet on the trail. I love conversations with fellow hikers, hearing a little or a lot about their lives.   
I see hearts everywhere, in nature & in people......whole, broken, cracked, full, soft, hard, sweet, bitter.....the list goes on. I desire to fully know Gods heart for others.  This is how/why I received my trail name, Heart Seeker. 
Daily I can make up excuses, but NOW is the time.  I will go forward, with Him by my side, & allow this journey to begin. 
On Tuesday, March 27th I will head out from Newfound Gap to Katahdin Maine. I will then come back, start at Newfound Gap & head south. That way I can be considered a “thru-hiker”, completing the whole trail in a year.  
Many thanks to those who have helped me reach the start of this new journey. 
Lionheart, I couldn’t have done it without you. What knowledge I’ve gained over what, 8 + years of hiking together? The gear you’ve provided, the rides to trailheads, your knowledge of the AT in GA, really I wouldn’t be here today if it hadn’t been for our hiking together. “I Believe” it was your thru-hike journey that helped me believe that I could also take this journey. Curley Turtle & Force Flex our hikes together increased my confidence being out in the woods for days. Fresh Ground, your magic, your smile, your journeys gave me added inspiration. And all you hikers I’ve met along the way....I appreciate each one of you & your stories. 
And family......I wouldn’t be here without their love & support. Brother, sisters, SIL, BIL’s, nieces, nephews...thank you!
What gave me the final drive to go, Erin, was you (& Greg). Just knowing that you are “behind” me, even willing to come out for a bit to hike with me, means more than you will ever know. You were like my “stake of approval”. Thank you, I love you.

 I hope that I too, can be an inspiration to others to step out & go on a journey. Take the leap & give it your best.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sun",0
Heart Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584550,"Good morning! Temperatures  have dropped here in SC to 45° this morning & it is windy. I am thinking of all you hikers out there. I hope it doesn’t get much colder, I know you’ve already had your fair share of cold weather. 
It’s becoming more “real” each day. I signed up at the ATC website and got my Smokies permit. Waiting on a couple last minute gear items. 
Following a few hikers on YouTube, that can get me feeling ready. 
I’ll put my pack on today and get some miles under my feet.
Later,

Heart Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585013,"Very surreal, but hoping for a real good nights sleep in this comfy bed. Leave in the morning for 3 1/2 drive to Newfound Gap. Hoping to be in Pecks Corner shelter tomorrow night. My pack seems a little heavy, but it’s what I’m going with (33 lbs). Signing off anxious but excited.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Mon",0
Heart Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585691,"Hot Springs is amazing! I have been here before with fellow hiker, Lionheart, but at that time we were doing trail magic for another hiker, Batman. This time I come through as a hiker. Hospitality is amazing. First night I stayed at Elmer’s Sunnybank Inn. Old house from 1840’s with all the nostalgic antiques. I had a little room called “The Study”. Totally felt like I was at my grandparents. The dryer at the town laundromat was not working so I got to hang all my clothes outdoors at Elmer’s, wow, imagine your hiking clothes smelling like the fresh air! Elmer is also a gourmet cook, so this morning I was able to enjoy an amazing vegetarian breakfast!! All the guests including Elmer & staff, Matt, sat together so we could share in one another’s stories. Love, love, love!  This is an interesting thing in town............one hardly has reception on the trail (maybe an occasional mountain top), so you look forward to catching up when you get to town. Well........none of the restaurants have WiFi, & the two places where I stayed ask that you do not take your phone to meals or common areas, only in your room or areas where there are no other people. Hard, but a great awakening. I know I can update y’all at just the right time. My “zero” day here has been spent going through my pack to figure out resupply, which I was able to do this afternoon. I really am trying to focus on nutrition & calories, because so far I have not had a huge appetite on the trail. I know this is common & will change soon to what is known as “hiker hunger”.......just can’t get enough! Had to purchase a new stove and decided to purchase a “rain skirt” to cover lower half of my body. Good investments as far as I’m concerned. I am currently at the famous “Hot Springs Resort & Spa”. Someone in town who runs the Hikers Ridge Misistries gifted me with an hour soak in the mineral filled hot tub. Thought I would have trouble for sitting an hour.........well, I didn’t....with a glass of wine and overlooking the river running by & the mountains I did just fine, felt heavenly!I was also gifted by a couple of family members to a night at the Magnolia Inn, also amazing! I am set to do this on my own, but I so appreciated these gifts!! Thank you all for gifts of shelter, mineral soaks, prayers, encouraging words! They fill my heart to overflowing! I will try to get a couple other posts up before I head to Erwin, TN.......next resupply. 
Much love,","

I’m finding that Instagram & FB are easier for me to write & post, hopefully, if you want to follow along, you’ll follow me there. Grateful for family & friends. Love you!!","
