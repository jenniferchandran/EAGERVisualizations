Brain and I got to the parking lot at 11:20 Friday and set up our tents just as it started to rain. We made it 6 miles by 12 and stopped for lunch. By 1 it started raining as we headed out for another 6 miles. Was the worst rain that I have ever camped or hiked in.

Eagle ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591996,"We leave for the trail this Thursday, May 31 at 7 pm. Over the last few weeks, Brian and I have done work up hikes and have gotten our gear together. We are starting at the Amicalola Falls approach trail and hiking to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The section hike will be about 220 miles and take us about 3 weeks to compete. I want to thank everyone for the help and support that they have given us! I will try to post every day and keep everyone updated throughout the journey!

Eagle ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592529,"So this is it. After months of getting ready Brain and I are on the way to the trailhead. I wish I could say the bus ride was enjoyable but sadly it is not. Only about 12 more hours until we reach Atlanta! The feelings are bittersweet knowing that I’m leaving my family behind for 3 weeks. But the amount of excitement that I have for what is on the horizon is unexplainable. I am thankful for the love and support my family and friends have given me over the last few weeks. As I sit writing this watching the sunset through a window, that doesn’t seem to have been cleaned since the bus was made, I realized just how lucky I really am. Hopefully, I’ll sleep well tonight.

Eagle ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592648,"After getting off the bus at 10:40, we found another hiker who was also being driven by Ron. His name is Nick. During the drive to the park, Ron went over some of the problem areas and made sure we had everything we needed. After being dropped off and filling our water bottles we started on the trail! The waterfall was out of this world. The only shortcoming was having to climb the tallest waterfall east of the Mississippi. The day was great and we only had about 2 hours of hiking in the rain. I had a great day and I believe the others did too! Hope everyone likes the pictures!

We made it to three forks for lunch at 1 and then went to another water fall. After taking about 45 minuets enjoying the cold water and letting our shoes dry out, we headed to hawk mountain and had camp set up by 4:30. Overall it was a great day and everything got a chance to dry out from yesterday's rain! I'm currently laying down fighting to get this page to load so I can post this.

So I kicked it into high gear and raced to camp. Luckily it did not storm at all here today. We had a 650 foot climb and a 300 foot climb today. Both went great. Walked across a lot of friendly faces today and ended up camping with 4 of them. For those of you who are keeping track we only have 197.8 miles left to go!

At woody Gap, I got rid of my extra food and got a ROOT BEER. Had some amazing views today with a lot of ups and downs. Got to the shelter about 5:50 and it is packed here.

There were a lot of ups and downs today,  which were harder, making for a slower pace. We had climbed an 800 ft ascent, followed by a 750, 300 and 500. Had some great views though, more tomorrow.

You could not have asked for better weather! I saw my first bear today! Well 2 bears! Super awesome to hike past bears. Hopefully I’ll see more before the trip is over. We said goodbye to a lot of great people today. Troop 75 were a great group of guys! 2 nights ago they gave us their extra dinners! Which were fantastic. Although we had a great group to hike with it is nice to sit in a quiet camp after washing off. Missing my dog bear a little more today as I sit writing this. I’ll be uploading pictures tonight if I am able.

I haven't had any problems so far. Hopefully, it stays that way. It feels great to be laying in a bed with a fan blowing cool air on you. Tonight I will be uploading as many pictures as I can! Thank you to everyone who has been reading this! Having the love and support from everyone helps a lot! 
Hopefully, the weather won't be as bad as they are predicting. Rain will not be fun but rain every day this week will be hard. We have stayed dry until now so I am thankful for that. 
After a wonderful day and going into town for a great meal and some little treats. (Burgers, fries, pop and, fudge) I already miss the trail. I just want to hike. Having a nice cabin is a wonderful treat but nothing compares to a long day of hiking. I'm excited to get back out there and put down some more miles. Talking with everyone on the phone was a special treat as well. I miss you all and can’t wait to get back and see everyone. 
I’m super excited to hike around scout camp with Mr.Shimandle this year. Hopefully he leaves a few miles to do with me. I’m more than prepared this year after hiking the trail!

Eagle ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593618,"Feels great to be back on the trail. It’s another beautiful day to climb mountains. Taking it nice and slow on the hills and enjoying the views along the way. Food bag was a little heavy leaving after the resupply but having a nice dinner the first 2 nights is worth the extra weight. I’m going to sleep well tonight. Writing this from an over look and I could drift off to sleep right now. Nice slow breeze, sunny and, blue sky with pretty clouds. After writing this I’m gonna take out the camera and make sure to get a few good shots. A lot of people look at me like I’m crazy for carrying 4 pounds of just camera gear. But the pictures that I’m getting are well worth a little extra weight. I was at 45 pounds leaving the hostel today. Had a big lunch, and I’m going to have a big dinner and should be back to 40 by tomorrow night. 
Hopefully the pictures I take after writing this will get uploaded as well. I have great service here almost on top of Courthouse Bald. Today has been a great day.

We took a slow 6 miles to the summit of Standing Indian Mountain and had a nice long lunch. The sky cleared up and the fog started lifting during lunch which was great! Hopefully the rain hold off again!! It looks like it should! The couple we have been hiking with had to get off the trail today. It was sad to see them leave. We had a great talk last night about scouts and the trail. 
The weather has been great even though this morning was not the greatest we still have yet to get rained on since Springer. I still feel great and have had no major issues or injuries. Today is going to get us into triple digits for our trip and tomorrow we will be passing mile 100 on the A.T! It feels great to wake up and be able to hike all day long. Hopefully we make it to camp without it raining.

Beverly was our driver and was fantastic! We got our food, charged our batteries and, had an all you can eat lunch. Looks like we will be hiking the last couple of miles in the rain today but it’s only about 3.5 miles. After having a great lunch and feeling recharged I’m ready to get back out and hike! Hopefully, I will have service at the shelter. BEVERLY paid for our lunch and gave us a free shuttle. She is a wonderful person and fantastic shuttle driver. The amount of trail magic that is out here is amazing. People go out of their way to help hikers who are cold and wet. Hopefully one day I get to help people the way that we have been helped.
We made it to camp without getting rained on! Each day is a blessing out here. It makes me thankful for the luxuries I have at home. I miss being able to see my family and friends. I miss showering and putting on clean clothes. Not that I’m complaining about being out here. Because this trip has been AMAZING but it has given me a lot of time to think and it has made me grateful for everything I have. Getting good morning texts or goodnight texts from everyone has been a blessing. Don’t be afraid to send a quick text to me! It just may be awhile before I respond. The days may be getting longer but I seem to fall asleep earlier and earlier.

We of course slept in a little bit and started moving around 8:00. After a nice relaxing morning we started about 10:00. The hike was mostly down hill. Except for a smaller up hill (around an 800 ft increase). After getting out of the woods we saw a sign that the shelter was 1.1 miles away! It was great! I started on the hike happy as can be. But as I was walking and walking it seemed like more than a mile. The “1.1 to the shelter” ended up taking us 35 minutes. The land was not overly hilly nor did we walk slower than our 20-25 minute mile time. After finally reaching the shelter, we were able to eat, take showers and, charge our phones! It did not rain on us but we did hear some thunder as we came in the final “1.1”. As excited as I am about a zero day. I still just want to be out in the woods hiking tomorrow as well.

Only a few more days on the trail. It’s amazing to see how far we have come. Yet we only did a small portion of the trail. The amazing people that we have met along the way.

The walk down went fast and Aunt Karen and Dad had started the hike up! Seeing them was exciting but also a little sad because I knew the trip was over. After changing, getting into the car, dropping off Minnie at her car, and going to the visitors center. We were on the road home. As excited as I am to see everyone, I am sad to be getting off. I started this trip because I felt like I had to go hike it. Getting off is hard. I still feel the need to finish it. So as I end my trip I want to thank everyone who has kept up with the entries! The people in my life who have supported me are the reason I was able to do this. I am thankful for all of you. My mother and father were great through all the months of planning and having gear spread throughout the floor. My Aunt for taking her time to come and pick us up. And all of my family for supporting my crazy idea. This may be my first trip but I know there will be more in my future.
