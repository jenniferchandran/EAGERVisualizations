Flash Hand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582523,"Right now I am in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica. I have about 2 and 1/4 months to land my feet on Springer Mountain again.  That is my 3rd time been to Springer Mountain.  The first time I was there, I hiked with Scotty ""One Leg"" Rogers and the 2nd time, I started without a partner until I caught up with Fred ""FishinFred"" Orser for some miles.  First two attempts were failed.  I blame myself for not be able to make it through.  Of course, it was my fault because I wasted too much time in trail towns, too much time on Internet, spend too much money on beers, hiked too slow, woke up late to start.  I lost my wallet in 2005 attempt and realized I was falling behind schedule and knew I won't be able to make it to Katahdin.  I bailed out. I planned for another hike in 2007 but decided to put it on hold and start traveling in most countries around the world.  I started in 2009 in Mexico and right now, I am in Costa Rica.  While traveling, I become Hostel Manager for Ensenada Backpackers in Baja California, Mexico, Hostel staff for Hostel Cosmopolitan in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and become a hostel owner and ran hostel for only 2 years in Siem Reap, Cambodia.   I had to shut the hostel down because I couldn't convince landlord to rework on lease renewal.  After closing the hostel, I start traveling again for short time.  Now I am seriously considering to settle down after a long travel BUT, one thing, I will not settle until I make it through the 2,200 miles Appalachian Trail.  This year is the time.  So for me writing this journal again, I will write differently from what I did in 2004 and 2005.  I will try to write journal short and sweet and upload less photo because I need to invest more time on trail instead of on computer.   I maintain my own Facebook since the year of 2007.  I will keep trailjournal and Facebook active throughout the hike. Now its dark, the mosquitoes in Costa Rica are like hungry wolves. I gotta run back in my dorm. I am packing my stuff as I will be going to San Jose tomorrow.   As a die-hard Patriots fan since day one, I will be staying in San Jose until after Super Bowl.",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Sun",0
Flash Hand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583045,"Right now, I am in San Miguel De Allende, a beautiful colonial town in Mexico.   While traveling in Mexico, I still am figuring out how to prepare for my thru-hike.  I would have only about 6-7 weeks to prepare.  I will be very busy during month of March, which I will prepare transportation from Arizona to Georgia, buying some new gears, companion and data books. 
I figured out that I should start sometimes between April 13 and 15.  I know that April 15 is the last day of thru-hiker season. I calculated that I would need to hike more than 12 miles DAILY with NO zero days to accomplish the 2,200 miles before shut down date of October 15. To have zero days, then I will need to hike more than 12 miles daily to be able to have zero days.   
I started the chat on Facebook with Rick Towle (trailname ATTroll).   He is the Whiteblaze.net creator.  He told me that to make the feat to accomplish 2,200 miles is to have good mentality.   All I need to have mentality to accomplish and I agreed with him. 
I also spend a lot of time thinking about why I failed 2 times to thru-hike in 2004 and 2005.  I believe it was because I felt lonely.  Most of the time at shelters, I seek for some good conversation with other hikers but they did not bother to write instead, they sit by the campfire and chatting with other hikers.  After I left A.T. I start traveling.  I learned a lot while solo traveling for almost 10 years.  I developed the thinking mechanism.  Many time, I would keep busy thinking of many things while walking for many miles to the next destination, or sit down by the beach thinking of different things, that will keep me entertained with no need to have someone else by my side.   I hope that my thinking mechanism will stay functional while hiking on Appalachian Trail.  That is how I can keep hiking without the feeling of being lonely.  
First two attempts in 2004 and 2005, I found other deaf hiking companions, but they bailed out at very last minutes before I depart for Georgia.    So, this year, I vowed myself NOT to bother about finding companion.   I do not want any stress about finding another hiker to go with me.  Compromise is a stress builder, so no companion = no compromise.   
There is no way I will be alone on Appalachian Trail.  I know I will meet many hikers on the trail, and even I will make new friends on the trail.  Its just that I do not want any compromise and waste time with those people who always talk but never take act.   I am getting bored with those type of people. 
See you soon, Appalachian Trail!",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Sat",0
Flash Hand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584244,"4 weeks left to go....
Am I panic for lack of preparation, training or exercise?  The answer is no. I am a couch potato but I do walk often to keep my legs flexible.
Since writing the last entry in Mexico, I am now in Queen Creek, Arizona taking care of my dad because his wife is gone to her home country, The Philippines.   She will be back on April 9, few days before I catch a flight for Atlanta, Georgia.  I already booked air ticket with Southwest Airline.  I am excited!  I already got 2018 edition of Appalachian Trail Thru Hiker's companion. I was very impressed with that version because it included all mileages, trail information and even elevation.  I do not have to carry maps and data book.  It will lighten up my load.  I already got AT Passport.  Look forward to collect all stamps!
I still have no backpack and hiking boots yet but will buy them soon.  I will also set up a fan page on Facebook for my thru-hike adventure so it can be opened to public than my personal Facebook account. 
I choose to have my friend, an Atlanta local, who will be more than glad to pick me up from airport, and let me stay over at their place overnight, so we can have some good chit chat.  The next day, he will take me to what I need to do before landing my feet at Amicaola Falls State Park.  Its better than spending money on hostel near or around AFSP.  I researched for hostels and they seemed not what thru-hikers want.   They seemed to be business oriented instead of budget or adventure minded hostels. So the first thing I arrive AFSP will be catching a space at a shelter OR go ahead and hike up to Black Gap Shelter, which sits about 1 miles south from first White Blaze. 
After watching some serious heavy snowstorms hitting New England, and that I can sense the weather is not being nice right now, so glad I got 4 weeks to wait, hopefully weather will be nicer when I land my feet on Springer Mountain!",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Fri",0

Tomorrow morning, when I wake up, of course I need to re-pack everything in my new backpack then when everything look good, then I start hike!

I asked the staff, where Max Epperson Shelter is, he pointed to that shelter just in plain view from the backyard of headquarter.  It was so dark that I could not see.  I left at 9:45AM and was given a Thru Hiker number 2206.  I said to myself, that was a lot of Thru Hikers that left AFSP before me!I arrived Black Gap Shelter after a tough hike uphill.  Luckily that I got a space at shelter.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Flash Hand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589084,"I was shivering in a sleeping bag inside tent, it was windy and so cold.  Then I woke up, I thought there were some dust or dead leaves on my tent, but learned it was some snow during the night. I survived the cold night!When I woke up, I suddenly saw some nuts inside my backpack, obviously, some animals, maybe squirrel, chipmunk or mice found a warm place to eat their dinner in my backpack under my tent's tarp. Oh well, I am a deaf hiker, I won't hear them eating or squeaking.  I guess they found a tent with nobody shoo them off. I got up and left at 11:00AM, yeah a late start because I hate to get out of warm sleeping bag during cold day.  I still am trying to assemble my backpack correctly with some adjustment.It was easy hike for 7.6 miles to Gooch Mountain Shelter.  I start to notice that each shelter have bear box installed that I never see in my 2004 and 2005 hike.  Look like there were some bear/human encounter happens more often now. When I got in Gooch Mountain, I was pretty hungry and cold.  There was an old man that tried to talk to me as I was busy preparing my meals but I start to recognizing him thinking maybe I met him before, but was so busy preparing my meal so I told him I am Deaf and he nodded and came back to me with paper and pen.  He wrote down, what is your trail name. I wrote down Flash Hand, he was like amazed or bit surprised, then he proceed to write down his trail name but I stopped him and said, hey you Smokestack?  He said yes!  I was surprised to see him again!  We hug hard as it was so long time since I have not seen him since 2005.Smokestack still look great, still smoking pipe and in great spirit!  Too bad his wife, Mother Nature is in Germany so I told Smokestack to give her my regards.Another COLD night in Gooch Mountain Shelter.  So cold that I put two coats on, socks, face mask, and slept inside a closed sleeping bag.  I survived again!","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Flash Hand,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589085,"Left Gooch Mountain Shelter at 8:30AM during VERY cold morning. I was like, I want to stay in my sleeping bag bit longer but seeing other hikers already are up and ready to leave. I would feel guilty myself if they all left while I am the last lazy hiker still in shelter. So I said, GET UP! GET OUT!  I made it, I got out of sleeping bag. The 11.8 miles hike was more challenging to my over rusty legs.  The weather was nice but somewhat cold once after I arrived Woodshole Shelter.  Guide book said that Woodshole was in honor of Late Tillie and Roy Woods as the original owners of Woodshole Hostel.  I met Tillie in 2004 and she was very amazing woman.  I never met Roy myself. During the hike, I had my first snake sighting, I think its Gartner snake, (non-venomous) My feet caught blisters.  I pop some gooey out, it were bad. I hoped they would heal quickly because I pop them out.  I never have any blister on my 2004 and 2005 hike, I assumed that because I only wear one pair of socks instead of 2 pair of socks.  From that time, I started to use 2 pair of socks on each feet.I am glad Woodshole Shelter was positioned in right direction, not facing the uphill cold winds from down the mountain.  That way I slept more warmly overnight.  Actually, the only reason I hate Woodshole Shelter is because it was .4 miles off of the trail.  That was a long hike to the shelter from A.T.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

As I was, oh well, let me enjoy my coca cola and a portion of cheddar cheese then hike up again as there was no options left for me.  I did ask the staff for $5 for shower as non-guest.  He said, no.  I even say, the guidebook said so, then he said, oh well it is discontinued because they want to conserve water.  I guess I will have to let the author of the guidebook know to make an adjustment.A few minutes, I got good news, a hiker canceled his bed in order to get another place elsewhere.  My feet were so happy. While my stay in the hostel, I found two old register books for 2004 and 2005 Northbound Thru Hikers. I found myself and my other hiker friends, Scott Rogers, ""One Leg"", Smokestack, Mother Nature, Fishin Fred, Nick Johnson (Mr. Pink) registered in those notebooks.  I will post pictures on my Facebook once I get to Hot Springs.After 6pm, a hiker came to me, saying, hey, some drinks out there. I was like???    When I got out and oh yeah, there is a trail magic, two late aged, friendly ladies give hikers some hotdogs and beers.  I took 2 beers and 1 hot dog.   I felt so good.During the trail magic conversation, everyone was talking to each other except me and another hiker's dog.  I only watched them chatting, laughing and drinking.  I was busy thinking about everything else, especially my blistered feet. I went back inside hostel until about 7pm, again another hiker came to me, drink outside. I was like again?  Yeah a new trail angel showed up with case of Lite Beers and fried chickens.   I took 4 beers and a fried chicken.While inside a hostel, I chatted briefly with a section hiker, he told me he knows my name Flash Hand because he was reading my journal here.  Good to know someone is reading my journal, but sorry I forgot his name.

Smokestack watched me while I am adjusting my backpack.

I think this water filter pump need some cleaning.  I tried to open it up but it was glued lock and could not open.I got enough water that filled up my pouch for a 11.9 miles hike to Blue Mountain Shelter with another water refill at Low Gap Shelter.  The pump seemed to be okay at that time. At Low Gap Shelter, I found a new 2018 Thru Hiker Companion Book with 2 fuel canisters. It seemed that a thru hiker decided to bail out and left them for other hikers.I continued the hike to Blue Mountain Shelter.  I arrived at 6:30pm and saw everyone tenting around the shelter as I was like, oh no, the shelter is full, but no, the shelter is empty and I had this shelter to myself.  I looked at my watch, its 6:30pm, oh that is plenty of sunshine left.  So I proceed to start filtering my water pouch with water.  The pump start to show problem, I tried to fix it, but with no luck, another hiker tried to fix, but it worked again for a short time but then it quit completely.  I was in panic, I read guidebook to see where the nearest outfitter is, it looked like I should go to Top of Georgia Hiking Center as it stated its outfitter too.  I have enough water for the night and the next day because its only a short hike down to Unicoi Gap.I finally went to sleep after sundown.

I was like, no way, I can't hike without water.  She said that they provide free shuttle ONLY if I decide to stay at their hostel for the night.She called again and said that shuttle will come and pick me up ONLY if I give them my credit card number for reservation. I refused because I have not check my balance for few days.   I told her, I have cash with me.  She said the hostel staff won't send shuttle unless I give them my credit card number.   Another Trail Angel heard the conversation she had with the hostel staff on phone, she offered to use her credit card to make a reservation.   I was like, its easy, I approached her and attempt to give her $30 in cash, she declined.  I was like no no, take that $30.  She said everything is okay and still decline.I told trail angel to be sure to let Top of Georgia Hiking Center to check my water pump, that is the only reason I want to go to T.O.G..  I have NO INTENTION to stay there tonight.

Some of my gears were wet, my pant, coat, socks, almost everything were wet.  I just want to take everything to laundry service and get them all cleaned and dried up.So I went back to Top of Georgia Hiking Center again after arrived Dicks Creek Gap.  It was still raining as I walk west for .5 miles to the center.  I met those people again that I stayed the last time.They QUICKLY focused on my booking.  As I said before,  they after you for money and business.  I was not impressed again.  They even NOT ask me how was my new water filtration pump.   So, I told them I want laundry service too, it was $5.  It did not outline weight limitation. I look all over for information but nothing. So I assume its $5 a load.  I went out to my room, took all of my dirty and wet clothes and put them in laundry basket.  I gave them and they were like, whoa, that is heavy and they even took weight scale and said, that my weight was over 8 pounds and guess what, they want OTHER $5.  I was very unhappy about it.  The owner seemed did not care, its like too bad its over 8 pounds.  He complained that he was losing money.  I was like, why losing money on laundry service, would it cost him more if my clothes were heavy?  That does NOT make any sense.   Finally the owner decided to get all of my clothes to wash for $5.  I told him I was a hostel owner before, and my laundry costs were 1 KG for $1, 2 KG for $2 and 3 KG and up for $3.  He was bit surprised I was a hostel owner myself before. Hostel owner came to me in the dormitory area, we talked about hostel business. He expressed his concern about his business and apologized to me about laundry stuff.  He did mention that he is thinking of selling the place since he find its hard and with struggle. In my opinion, his hostel is VERY nice, great place and should not be sellable unless someone else want to continue the business. I do feel bad that he was expressing his struggle and trying to earn as much money as he can to keep his business running.  Probably that is why he was hoping to collect more money for laundry service.   I pointed that out he should have make a pricing list so that way he won't have problem with hikers like me.Anyway, the clothes were heavy just because some clothes were soaked and wet from rain.  I got my clothes back and it was noticeably lighter than when I gave them.Free shuttle service for hikers to Hiawassee town for resupply was scheduled at 1pm or 4pm. I choose 4pm because I got so many things to arrange with my stuff.   Turned out that I am the only hiker that choose 4pm while everyone else opted for 1pm shuttle.At 4pm I got in town to buy some stuff, including ointment for my feet.  My shuttle came at 6:20pm to pick me up to go back to hostel.  The driver is cool but not have patience.  He ran to store to get coffee from Starbucks counter and we got in van when rain start to pour.  When he got back on the road, we ended up behind a slow moving tanker truck uphill while it was rain and it was annoying the shuttle driver.  He decided to pass that truck with two yellow lanes on curve and wet road up hill hoping to past tanker truck.It scared me hell because he could've lost traction and become hydroplane but he made it past the tanker and looked me with big smile on his face as if its no biggie.   Yes he scared the hell out of me.  HE was lucky, I was the only hiker in the van, because if there were many in the van, some of them would complain.

I asked him about the wrong boot.  (he knows very little sign language and fingerspelling) he said oh, that was you or that was the boot.  He told me someone at T.O.G was looking for her boot.   I asked him who is that person.  He said It was a chubby lady with a dog was trying to recover her boot.   I asked him if she was mad.   He said no but she was confused why her boot was missing.  We indeed, laughed for a bit.   My thinking pop up, was that same lady and dog I talked about at trail magic at Walasyi Center?

I was like, I should get out more earlier and saw almost everyone gone except 4 of us.I hiked up to Long Branch Shelter, I love that Shelter, very spacious with privy really close by behind the shelter.  I saw something in privy but wished I would took picture of it.   It was a big nest made of toilet paper up on the ceiling in privy. I was like, where did those mouse or birds took those toilet paper from since all privy do not have toilet paper.  Hikers were the one that carry toilet papers all of the time to use at those privies.   I start to fix my eyes on that nest, then I realize maybe mouse or birds took those used and soiled toilet paper out of bottom of privy and made a nest out of them.","Carter Gap Shelter

Anyway it was nice day hike with sunny.   Siler Bald Shelter have a broken, non-functional bear cable but it still have a wire hanging up in trees.   I hanged my food up there with my rope and tied to tree while I noticed other hikers choose to hang their bear bag on tree down the hill in grassy camping area. Off I went to sleep.","Long Branch Shelter

Hikers were trying to get their food bag down but it got stuck in the tree, about 10 feet above them.  They become bear themselves while figuring out to get food down.  It took about 20 to 30 minutes for them finally to get their food back down.
While hiking, I met a section hiker, named Rain Man. He tried to talk to me but I told him I am Deaf.  He took paper and pen out and write as we start conversation. He was very nice and friendly guy.  He told me he finished the entire Appalachian Trail last year in October of 2017 after 14 years of Section Hiking.  WOW!  He asked me if I need anything, I told him no but was looking forward for Coca Cola at NOC.
He said he have one in his car and asked me to meet him at the top of Wayah Bald.  I said ok and when I finally met him at the top (yes he hiked more faster than me) and got a cold Coca Cola and a beautiful view out of Wayah Bald, in front of tower. I noticed more and more hikers showing up. I was like I need to hurry up and hiked down as fast as I could and catch the space at Cold Spring Shelter.  I did and caught a space.  Hikers showed up and looked in the shelter, but there is only one space left but they choose to camp out .1 mile north of Shelter.
At least I got space at shelter because I am too lazy to set up tent then pack them in again the next morning.","Siler Bald Shelter

Rufus Morgan Shelter.  That was a terrible downhill hike!When I arrived to A. Rufus Shelter, I was really serious about getting to shower at NOC.  I took almost everything out of my pack and went to NOC.  When I got there, I bought 6 pack of beers and a 16 oz can Pabast beer.  I took shower and it was coined shower, not a $2 shower as what Thru Hiker Companion book stated that.  I went back to shelter after the good shower.  I happen to see Nancho, a hiker I met few days before.  I thought he was ahead of me but he is still around. It gave me confidence that my slow hiking pace is not a problem because I still be able to catch up with them. 16 oz Pabast beer surprised me. it is more of IPA than regular 12 oz Pabast beer.  I enjoyed each can before I go back to sleep.","Cold Spring Shelter

Anyway, when  I got up.  three hikers who slept next to me got up, 1 left and the other 2 stayed for a bit finishing up their beers.  I asked if they have extra and Nacho sure had it and gave me one.  Its a good breakfast because beer is 300 calories worth to fill up your empty stomach. 
So I left shelter to go to Nanhtahala Outdoor Center.  I stopped by general store to buy more beers then did some shopping at outfitter store and at around 2pm, 
I saw Nacho at NOC again, I shared him my beer.  We chatted for a bit.   I left first before him.
I hiked up the uphill, stopped for few times, to empty the beers I carried with me.  They are so heavy.  Peach and Nacho caught up with me.  Peach hiked up further while Nacho stopped and sit with me and drinking some beers.   He vowed to hike up to the next shelter. I told him I will follow him
He still too fast for me.
i realized my balance was out of whack, there is no way I can hike up to the shelter but I saw other hikers tenting up at the campsite and I joined him.One of hiker started a campfire, I keep that campfire burning until 11pm.  This hiker who started this fire told me to stop collecting dead woods because if they are going to sleep. I told him, I am not going to sleep so I want the campfire to burn that long. He understood and went back to his tent.   I really enjoy the campfire that late, so dark, in the woods and the aroma of wood burning make this evening so special!","A. Rufus Morgan Shelter

I say no no no beer because of the experience I had from NOC.One hiker offered to make a call for a shuttle for me to get to Fontana Village. I did not ask him to make call for me but he wanted to do so and the shuttle was already waiting on the parking lot 1/2 mile from shelter.  so I went.I got to the village, all in my mind is BURGER.   I went to bar where they serve meals. I saw Nacho again and he also introduced me to new hiker friend, named Hal. (he got no trail name yet)Nacho told me by writing about his experience hiking up to Sassafras Shelter, the night when I was so drunk and slept in tent and he vowed to continue to hike.   He told me he arrived Sassafras Shelter at 10:30PM, he fell once and bent his hiking poles and told me he will never do that again.I told him if I followed him all the way I would arrive shelter at 2AM.   Now I should be glad I did not follow him, instead, erected the tent for that night.I asked Nacho if I can use his shower.  He said his towels are all wet but Hal have some dry towels.  Hal told me he have extra bed in the room so I stayed for the night.  I did not sleep good that night but heck, I enjoyed a hot shower and a clean and soft mattress to crash.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter
