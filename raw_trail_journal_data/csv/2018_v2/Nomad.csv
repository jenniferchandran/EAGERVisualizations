Nomad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550534,"So, why am I here? Why am I sitting on my couch typing an entry in a trail journal? Let me start with who I am. My name is Chip and I have chosen the trail name ""Nomad"". I chose that name because throughout my whole life I have moved around quite a bit. As a child I moved between Ohio and Indiana for many years. As a young adult, I joined the Marine Corps when I graduated high school and then lived all over the east coast and overseas. Through my entire life, up until now, I have moved every few years. I have lived in Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Mississippi. I have also lived overseas in Okinawa, Japan, Incirlik, Turkey and Iraq. I have visited Europe and the middle east during my career. This constant movement came to a halt when I retired in 2009. I moved back home to Ohio and settled down. I have lived in my current home in Clayton, OH for 7 years now. That may not seem long to many, but for me it represents the longest time I have ever lived in one spot my entire life. This leads me into the ""why"".As I stated, I have been in one spot for a long time (at least in my mind). It's time for another adventure. I am not planning a hike because I am trying to escape anything or anyone. I am not looking to ""find"" myself or change who I am. I am planning a hike to ""slow the world down"" for awhile. I am constantly on the go and always in a hurry. I spent my Marine Corps career always working towards the next job or the next move and then working towards retiring. When I retired I opened my own business and was always looking for the next job or to expand my business. I am always running at 100 MPH, always looking ahead and not around. I am planning my hike so I can learn to be ""in the moment"". I am also looking forward to the challenge, getting into the woods and simplifying things a bit. I will admit that the thought of having very few responsibilities for the first time in my life intrigues me a bit as well.","

Nomad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550536,"This will get some groans and eye rolls from many people who read this, but it is what it is. I first started thinking about the Appalachian Trail after watching Bill Bryson's movie ""A Walk in the Woods"". I know what some of you are thinking, here we go another middle age man having a mid life crisis who hits the trail because of a movie. Well that is true and not true. Its true in the regard that the movie started the wheels turning. But, to give credit where credit is due it was David ""AWOL"" Miller who is responsible for igniting the fire in my gut. After a quick search in Amazon, I found Awol's book and ordered it. I ended up devouring the book in just a few short days and I was hooked. I promptly ordered the 2016 trail guide, not really sure what it was. A funny story about the guide though. After a week or so I still hadn't received guide. So I looked at the website and called the customer service number. A very nice gentlemen answered and said he had seen my order and was going to look into it. I slowly realized that I was actually talking to Awol. Well, in my eyes at the time (and still) I was talking to a celebrity! I told him how I enjoyed his book and told him he encouraged me to start thinking about the trail. He immediately told me that my experience on the trail may not be the same as his and some had been upset about that. Looking back, I bet he has heard that same statement from many people. Anyway, I found him to be a very pleasant person and was very happy to have been able to speak with him, if only for a short time.  The next book I stumbled across was Gary Sizer's book ""Where's the next shelter"". After reading this book I also have to give a lot of credit to Gary. I found his book to be very funny and I enjoyed his writing style. I even ended up following him on Facebook and enjoy reading his posts. So I think it is safe to say I am a reader, I have always loved reading. I have devoured at least a dozen books on the AT and have read Gary's and Awol's books multiple times. After reading books for about six months and talking with my wife about them, I started to float the idea that I wanted to hike the trail. My wife's response was always ""That's nice dear""...LOL. After talking about it a few times I started to add some details to the plan. This got my wife's attention and she was not happy! Her first reaction was ""You've been planning this haven't you?"" She was not happy with me and I let it drop for awhile. I actually felt pretty guilty. I felt selfish and foolish for even bringing it up. But inside I still agonized over how I could hike the trail. I will admit I fantasized about to and extent that was unhealthy. Finally the more I spoke to my wife she started to realize how important it was to me and she began to at least consider my request. I truly underestimated how she would react to my plans. But, it makes perfect sense. I am a retired Marine and I have left my family many times and it was just a part of life. I was approaching this from the same mindset. Only one problem, my wife and I married after I had retired and that was never a world she lived in. Recently my wife has come to understand why I want to hike and I did a lot better job of explaining things. I now have her full support and she even sat and listened to my boring plans and gear lists.  Some may read this and think I am whipped for asking my wife if I can go. You are absolutely correct! Permission from my wife was the most important thing to me. This is a very selfish thing I am planning. I will be leaving her alone to keep the home fires burning for up to six months. I don't take that lightly. My wife's permission is also important because in some way it validates what I am doing. I also know what I am asking of her is huge.","

Nomad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550538,"So, what now. My plans are to still try and get out a couple times this year weather permitting. I have some nice local trails that may not have any mountains but they will allow me to test some of my gear and get some things worked out. I am thinking about either a LASH or possibly hiking the Long Trail September 17'. Regardless, I will be doing a long(ish) hike next September to work out the bugs in my gear and my body. Its a long way until 2018 but I feel I have a lot of work and planning to do. One important thing for me is that I don't want to overplan. I want to allow the trail to guide my hike and experience as much as I can.","

Nomad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553209,"Well, it seems everything is falling into place. I operate a small franchise in the home inspection industry. I have been working to get my ducks inline to approach my franchise company about my hike. I have been nervous about this aspect and was concerned about how it would be received. I set up a conference call with the corporate office to discuss my contract and to see what, if any could be done to take six months off. WOW, I had hoped that they would be supportive but never could have imagined just how much! They have granted me a leave of absence for the duration of my hike! This is a huge weight off my shoulders because it would have been one more expense during a time I would not be earning.  As I write this, the owner of the franchise company sent me a follow up Email reiterating their support and taking care of the legal aspects! Thanks Ron!! Now the last piece is saving enough money to cover my expenses and to ensure my wife and kids are taken care of while I am gone. I am fortunate enough to be retired from the Marine Corps so I will have income while I am gone. This just got REAL!! I am so thankful for the support I am getting from my family, friends and now my Corporate office!  The countdown will commence soon once I decide on an exact date for my departure in 2018. I am leaning towards the last week in February or first week in March.Nomad","

Nomad,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578010,"Its been awhile since I have posted anything.  I am still on track and have finalized my gear, which is a story in and of itself.  I have essentially replaced every piece of gear I started with in an attempt to light the load.  I am also in the process of creating a Vlog on youtube.  Mainly to share my adventure with my friends and family, but to also keep it for myself.  Hope everyone is well and I will post a link to my youtube account soon.","
