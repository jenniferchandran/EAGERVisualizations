Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582830,"For the
past few months, many aspects of my life have been consumed with the realities
of hiking consistently for up to six months in areas of the country I have
never been to before. All that coupled with the fact that I will be hiking
these unknown woods alone, in the technical sense, isn't necessarily unsettling
but does introduce some skepticism into the realm of my thoughts. Thinking of
my one way ticket to Georgia and the ""walk"" home is extremely
humbling. This is no small task, that's for sure. 
Logistically,
I had never imagined the amount of work I would have to put in to preparing for
my hike. I am figuring out where to send myself mail in order to eat something
other than what I can find at the dollar store and put on a fresh pair of
socks. I'm doing gear research and purchasing hundreds of dollars of new
equipment that I will use as my house, shower, stove and bed while carrying it
on my back 2200 miles. I have been creating a rough itinerary for those back
home to have an idea about where I am and to not feel the need to call NH Fish
and Game on me again (Thanks Mary, mom and Abby). I've been figuring out how to
even get to the start! And finally deciding whether or not it would be
practical to attend my graduation at Westfield State in May. There's a lot and
honestly I probably will still walk into this whole trip completely blind
anyway, and that's okay with me. For all the planning I do, my dad will remind
me that life will happen and change everything similar to John Lennon’s quote
""Life is what happens to you while you're making other plans."" The
reality is that as much as I plan, something will happen or an experience will
arise that shifts those plans into the worthless Word document they are now.
But still it makes me feel a little better and I think it will help with the
global time frame.
With any
free minute I can get from work and obligations I am pushing to get out on a trail
of any sort, and do some pre-training for my six month career as a hiker. My
job for six months is to literally hike -- and that sounds amazing. I guess that
makes it sound somewhat easy, which it won't necessarily be for the most part
but I will take the homework of finding the next reliable water source over
some of the homework and essays I had to painfully work on in the past years.
Hiking has been a passion for me especially in the past five years. The goal of
completing the Appalachian Trail has been on my radar since college began and
the thought of experiencing such a journey has yet to lose it's appeal to me.
As Martin Sheen is told in 'The Way'--- ""You don't choose a life, you live one"" and I
hope this experience can help me do just that.
I want
to send a special Thank You to
everyone that has helped me prepare in some fashion! From friends and family to
coworkers, you guys know who you are and know how much I appreciate even the
smallest of gestures!",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Sat",0

Not simple at all
I've always loved going on hikes and testing new gear and trying out what works well. Browsing the internet for new items to add to my growing collection or running into Eastern Mountain Sports (they have great rewards, I really recommend them!) is absolutely my addiction. BUT, I have never been hung up on brand names and styles like some. Similar to my ignorance of car makes and models-- I guess I just don't care much. If it works, Awesome! If not, I just move on. 
The caveat to that is that hiking 2,200 requires an ever so slight increase of interest in brand models and styles. So... for that reason and simply because I love the gear I have now, I am posting a list below of it if you're interested. If not, I'll at least add some fun to the writing to make it worthwhile to read! This is a list prior to a gear shakedown I'm hoping to receive from a friend of a friend. It's always changing but most of the big ticket items will likely remain until something I like better comes into my vantage point. Not all gear is listed.

Therma Rest Z-Lite sleeping pad 
EMS Boreal 20 Degree Long Sleeping Bag

H2O:
Sawyer Water Filter with one or two 32oz pouches (These are amazing-never had any issues filtering my own water) 
Camelbak 2L resevoir
Med Bag:
Tons of Ibuprofen, Gauze, bandaids, moleskin and foot+body powder (Everyone who knows me well knows my feet reek-- You're Welcome)Bodyglide

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584046,"My flight was canceled... not the entire trip! Luckily, I was notified of this the day before and did not have to sit in Logan Airport all day and night through our crazy snow storm! The new schedule is to leave tomorrow morning (3/14/18). With modifications made to the beginning of my hike, I will no longer stay at a hostel the night before-- I begin right away! Transitioning from shoveling 20"" of snow to hiking in North Georgia rain will be tough but the excitement is growing. Travel logistics are tough! Did I mention this is actually the first time I have flown by myself? Yeah, I didn't realize that until recently myself. I've flown plenty but this is a trip of firsts. The whole logistical nightmare continues to remind me of that meme on social media where young adults look around the room for an adult or at least an adultier adult for help until then find out they are that person. Luckily my Mom is just a phone call away (if I have service).Saying goodbye to everyone has been real tough. The Hampton Academy students and staff treated me so nicely and I hope they will follow along with the trip. Friends and family have been texting and visiting to wish me luck. It will be even more difficult to say goodbye to my parents and Abby but I'm aiming to make them all proud! Thanks to everyone for your support!I hope to be off and running tomorrow afternoon and will do my best to update this when I can. My sub-30lb pack and I will be working to build my trail legs up and get use to hiking again before tackling big miles. I know as soon as I step on the trail and begin my blood pressure will drop from its slightly elevated systolic position now (last set was 128/78-- I look really funny taking my own blood pressure). Everything will work out and this is just one small hurdle out of many I'll face for the next five months!-Phil ",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Tue",0
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584698,"The first day of my trip. Man, it's already going quick. I began with my flight being cancelled the day before. With that, my mom, dad and I awoke early to shovel out the driveway of the near 20"" of snow we received the night before and head to Boston Logan airport. Roads were slick but we made it safely.

In the airport, I said my final goodbye to my mom and made my way through security and to my gate... Unreal. My new flight plan was a trip to Richmond, VA where I would have a two hour layover then connect to another flight into Atlanta. I sat in the terminal as nervous as ever. The days leading up to this were nothing in comparison. We loaded the plane and I sat silently looking at the seat back in front of me, terrified. What was I doing?

The plane ended up being delayed roughly 2 hours. Every airline was doing their best to send out flights after yesterday's storm. When we finally took off, I sat motionless the entire hour and a half contemplating exactly what I was about to do.

We landed at the exact moment my connecting flight was scheduled to take off. Me and ten other passengers raced to the other terminal in the small Richmond airport and managed to make our connecting flight. Good and bad. I was hoping to charge my phone during the layover but I had to take what I could get!

We landed in Atlanta no problem and on the trip I couldn't help but realize the ""sea to summit"" 2L bag I had used as my carry-on item. I was literally going from sea to summit! Upon landing I had no time to think. I was wisked away by the hustle of the Atlanta airport and ended up at baggage claim as my box containing my 6 months of goods was coming out. I quickly crushed the box, left it near a recycling bin and filled my water bottles while I had the chance. I had to look so strange to the regular business attire everyone else was wearing!

I phoned my ride to Amicalola State Park. His name was Survivor Dave and he had thru hiked in 2008. He picked me up at the end of the hour long subway ride north of Atlanta in North Springs, GA. I had ZERO time to wrap my head around all this. Dave was the last connection I would have to ""society"" and it was surreal. We stopped at the supermarket during the hour and a half ride and I grabbed a sub and a half for dinner and lunch the next day! Glad I made that decision. I had a chance to charge my phone during the ride which was crucial.

On arrival at Amicalola State Park, I set up my sleeping bag and pad in the Max Emmerson shelter just behind the HQ building. In ceremony, I had my picture taken under the arch and made sure to phone home to let everyone know of my safe travels. I had made it to the trail and I had no idea what I was in for...

That night I slept in what I had thought was a 20 degree bag. Turns out that it had lost a lot of loft since I first got it and was not nearly what I needed. It proved an abrupt start to the trail but I was rejuvenated meeting Hank and the old lineman who would both set out on the same journey as myself. We all made it through the night and had an early morning start to our Appalachian Trail Hike.","Amicalola State Park

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584700,"On the morning of March 15th I officially started my ascent of Springer Mountain and the Appalachian Trail. I waited until 8:30am when the state park HQ opened to officially register and get my number. We were quickly given a tag noting our thru-hike attempt, offered a Snickers bar in good faith (which I happily took!) and wished the best as we began our hike. No ceremony, no warnings-- just a tag and a Snickers.

I began my hike about 8:45, first tackling the 600 or so stairs that line the water fall in which the park gets it's name. They were a quick kick in the butt to start. From there, I began my 8 mile ascent to Springer mountain where the AT officially begins. That means I did over 8miles extra before even touching the trail in which I came to climb. Crazy right? But seemed tradition.

I hiked another 2.8 miles from Springer and stayed at the Stover Creek Shelter. Temps were in the 60's and the sun was beaming. Couldn't have asked for a better day! I met a few wonderful people and set up my stuff in the shelter by 3pm. I almost pushed on with a nice gentleman named G-Bolt to a campsite just a few miles away but I stopped myself from going too fast too quick and stopped early. Happy I did!

I filtered water, took care of bodily functions and cooked an early dinner-- daily chores. I had the remainder of my sub that night and the Snickers bar I had gotten right in the beginning. Not a bad start!

Myself and only one other person slept in the shelter with a capacity of 20 or more for the night. I love the shelters only because I 1.dont have to set up a tent 2.enjoy the ease of packing up of gear in the morning and 3.enjoy the camaraderie of those who cook and hangout under the roof of the shelter at night. More people would enjoy the comforts of the shelter as the weather changed. Even when we have to face the mice!","Max Emmerson Shelter
",Stover Creek Shelter,"Mar 15, Thu",2.80
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584714,"I woke up early on Friday morning and snuck out of the shelter as quietly as I could. The best part is that shelter stays require minimal packing and essentially minimal noise. I grabbed my food bag from the bear box, rolled my sleeping bag, packed my bag and set off for a days hike. I usually get up around daybreak which is about 7:00am in the morning. If I'm lucky, I can be out hiking by sunrise at 7:30 leaving me ample time to enjoy the day.

My hike was 12.9 miles which was again in hopes of keeping it low to start and prepping my body for what was to come. Georgia mountains are not easy. They offer much different terrain than the White mountains where I am familiar but still are tough!

I hiked at a fairly leisurely pace. The only thing that pushed me was the threat of rain tonight. If possible, I was hoping to be in another shelter to avoid getting my tent wet. I talked with many people as the days are full of other thru hikers beginning their journeys too. Everyone I met consistently said ""oh, you're basically hiking home"" when I told then I was from NH. With my motto being exactly that from the beginning of the trail, I sort of adopted for myself the trail name: Homebound. Whenever I say my trail name I have to say ""Homebound, but I'm not from Maine."" It's a little annoying but I like the sound of it-- just walking home.

I made it to Gooch shelter at about 3pm. There were only a few spots left to sleep! A stark contrast to last night's empty shelter. Everyone was bracing for rain! I managed to snag a spot on the second floor which is my favorite spot. You stay a bit warmer and avoid any rain being blown in by the rain. Perfect!

The next day was St Patty's day and talk began about a party hosted by some locals tomorrow all day in the gap about two miles from the shelter. Information spreads so strangely on the trail! One person hears something and passes it to another. Each subsequent person continues to pass it along and low and behold everyone at every shelter within miles has heard a sort of variation of the original message.

I posted up at the shelter, did my daily chores and dried out my clothing. I was given a tip to clean my feet every evening and so I began wiping my feet with a baby wipe then putting a small amount of foot powder on them to dry them and keep then from blistering and anything from being infected! Thanks Chris and Abby! I also carry more socks than most because I was told it is miserable putting on wet and stinky socks each morning. Love that too and I'm not phased by the miniscule weight added to my pack. It's worth it!

That night someone started a camp fire. Many of us hung around the edge taking in the heat. Georgia isn't as warm as I had thought! Especially at night! Interestingly enough, a few hikers rely on camp fires to cook dinner each night. Most have jetboils or portable camp stoves of some sort but this was the first I had seen! There had been hikers already quitting up until now. Unprepared for the difficulty or weighed down by their enormous packs seemed to be the main causes. This reminds me of a hiker I saw the night before my hike. His trail name was Machete and he carried a machete for protection against bears. He became a sort of legend at the beginning as he carried a 65lb pack and I had yet to see him since 6pm Wednesday night as he headed up the mountain. Seemed a bit late to start!

I believe that night I had a pasta side for dinner. Breakfast is usually something quick, lunch is typically peanut butter tortillas with dried fruits or other things. Snacks are protein bars and candy bars during my hike and dinner is almost always hot! The sun goes down around 7:30 and most, if not all, hikers are in bed by 8. Now you may be thinking..  11 hours of sleep! Awesome! Not quite... Tossing and turning is pretty much standard for everyone and I hope to achieve roughly 8-10 hours in all but still not bad.","Stover Creek Shelter
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 16, Fri",12.90
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584716,"The entire night at Gooch Gap, I tried to conceal that I was aiming for a 15 mile day the next day. Most people have bad feelings about hikers doing big miles early and I know I probably shouldn't have but I had been feeling good and the mileage seemed doable. I was the first to wake up that morning and was out of the shelter by 7:30. I neglected breakfast at the shelter in an effort to stay quiet. I stopped about two miles in and cooked a meal on the side of the trail instead. Today's hike would bring me across the tallest mountain in Georgia-- Blood Mountain. Nerves were setting in for something that, looking back, was very doable, but larger and harder than I had done yet. I faced two good climbs. One at 3800' and the other at 4500'.

I passed the sight of where the St Patty's day celebration was to be held with little to no noise. Mist was covering the forest and light rain fell so I wore my green rain poncho. Not necessarily on purpose for the holiday but nonetheless it worked! With big miles ahead I ran into my first bit of trail magic! In Woody Gap, about 5 miles from last night's shelter, the Glenloch Baptist Church was cooking hot dogs, had a fire, offered medical supplies and good conversation. We were camped out next to a military batallion doing training that day. The two prior nights we had heard artillery fire in the distance and a Blackhawk helicopter pass RIGHT over the shelter! Pretty sweet. The church gave me a chili hot dog, hot coffee and some snacks for my food bag as I chatted around their campfire. We enjoyed conversation and blessings then I moved on.

Throughout the day I met many people. Two notable hikers were named Shiver and Tanner. Tanner is a 21 y/o from CT who is hiking as far as he can until May. He is a strong hiker and nice kid! Shiver is an 18 y/o who has hiked 3/4 of the trail already and just needs to hike to VA to complete her section/flip flop hike. She got her name from not having a sleeping bag for the beginning of her hike in NY and shivering every night.

Blood mountain proved a bit easier than expected and I met many wonderful day hikers on top. The descent leads right into Neels Gap where a store called Mt Crossings lies. They are a full outfitter with a hostel connected. They specialize in pack shakedowns for hikers carrying too much and many hikers shed tons of pack weight after a shakedown. I was feeling good about my gear except for my sleeping bag. I ended up dropping a fair bit of money on a new 3 degree bag that would prove extremely useful in just a few days! That along with a food resupply, a cooked frozen pizza and a stay at the hostel ran the bill up a fair amount but I suppose that's why I worked so much the months prior!

I delighted in the meaty frozen pizza as I chatted with other hikers and poked through the hiker box. These boxes are at every major hiker store and hostel and offer anyone gear that other hikers did not want for free! This box I was able to snag a box of Kraft mac and cheese!

That night I got a hot shower and stayed in the attached hostel. I got crazy lucky with some more trail magic too! At 6pm, another Baptist Church group came to the store and served hot dinner for all hikers! Burgers, beans, coleslaw and baked goods were provided. I was so lucky that day! Thank you to all those wonderful people!

I ended the night sitting in a bean bag tapping into the spotty WiFi at the hostel. I wolfed down pieces of pizza that other hikers couldn't finish. Seems their hiker hunger hasn't kicked in but mine definitely has! Sleeping in a real bed was amazing and rejuvenating!","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Neels gap,"Mar 17, Sat",15.40
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584718,"Today I pushed myself hard. I had the goal of going 11.5 miles to Low Gap shelter. This mileage was doable with not any crazy significant climbs. Myself, Mr Brazil and G-Bolt all left the hostel early in the morning ready to go from our wonderful stay. We powered through the 11 miles and reached the shelter by noon. Being smart, we may have slowed our pace prior but we each pushed ourselves and continued the extra 7 or so miles across somewhat easier terrain to blue mountain shelter. I was one of the first to grab a spot in the shelter to sleep and I went about my chores. There were tons of people here tonight and the shelter filled up with tons of tents around as well.

I had the honor this night of watching the Chef Gordan Ramsey, as he is called on trail, cook an amazing trail casserole out of the crappy food we all carry! Anyone who contributed got a piece and I wasn't going to miss this opportunity! He used his stove to cook a ramen packet and instant mashed potatoes together (a ramen bomb). With the Noddles being his base, he whipped out a cutting board... Yes a cutting board and fresh onion and pepper. He chopped them up and added a pasta side to the mix. Using some of his specialty spices, grated fresh cheese and pretzels as bread crumbs, he topped off his amazing concoction. Then he went as far as to toast the top by flipping over his jetboil and melting the cheese. This was the best food yet! No wonder he has the trail name he does!

I also met a guy named Ryan who doesn't carry trekking poles but instead carries a small guitar. As we all sat around the campfire eating a wonderful casserole, we listened to Ryan play some songs. One of my favorites was ""Fire and Rain"" by James Taylor. I fell asleep listening to some original JT in the woods of Georgia... What an amazing thing to say.","Neels gap
",Blue mountain shelter,"Mar 18, Sun",18.80
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584752,"I woke up as the remainder of the people in the shelter rose. It had rained during the night with pretty significant lightning! The morning was beautiful and the view from Blue Mountain Shelter was beautiful overlooking the mountainside. Today's hike was what we kept calling the W. It was a sharp down hill to Unicoi Gap then an uphill to Rocky mountain. From there another drastic downhill to Indian Grave Gap and another uphill to the peak of Tray mountain. After that a series of ups and downs for another 5 or so miles until the shelter- which was almost half a mile off the trail alone!

The climb was not as bad as anticipated. The downhills hurt the knees but the uphills feel good for the most part. Makes me think Miley Cyrus wasn't totally wrong when she said ""it's the climb!"" Good temperatures and sunshine helped with this task. The crew that was spread about doing the same trek as myself were all treated to a cooler full of sodas at Unicoi Gap left by a trail angel. Every small gesture like that is huge and gave us an energy boost for the climbs! A few people took off into the town of Hiawasee, GA as the remainder of us continued on. Myself and many hikers avoid attaching to one specific group. Doing so forces a certain expectation of mileage and, honestly, you get pretty sick of the same people over and over. Most cultures seem to have a way of saying live your own life the way you want. Pura Vida in Costa Rica touches on this, pop millennial culture has brought about YOLO or ""you only live once"" and the trail has HYOH which means ""Hike your own hike."" It's important to do this, take breaks, hike at your own pace and do what you feel is right. Listening to advice can be good but often, there are some hikers who constantly imply ""you're never going to make it"" based on gear, hiking style or any variable possible. You have to do what feels right.

This night I got to a small two story shelter around 4pm. We milled about, avoided the rain that spit from the sky and enjoyed our food. At night I slept on the top floor of the shelter as rain fell. It was essentially an attic but I didn't have the luxury of any mice running across my face as some hikers had reported while in shelters. You can definitely hear them though! Today I had made it 65 miles in! A fair amount in it itself!","blue mountain shelter
",Deep Gap Shelter,"Mar 19, Mon",15.50
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584754,"In the morning at deep gap, I awoke as many other hikers did. I was lucky enough to be on the trail by 745 or 8 and on my way. Today was a 15 mile day and I would cross into North Carolina! A good morale boost for sure! The forecast was iffy for the day so I wanted to try my best to get to Muskrat Creek Shelter and stay inside tonight. Today's hike was physically tough. I pushed myself hard but made it to my goal.

Around 1pm I managed to cross into North Carolina while surrounded by a few other hikers. We took the ceremonial pictures then got our butts kicked up the climb of Courthouse Bald. This mountain sits at 4800' but the climb seemed to never stop. At this moment I was rethinking my statement about Miley Cyrus being correct about the climb.

The clouds began to darker and winds picked up as I neared the shelter. I rolled in around 3 and contemplated pushing on another 5 miles to the further shelter to put me in a better spot for tomorrow. I'm sure glad I didn't! Around 4 or 5 the sky unloaded a flurry of rain, then sleet, then hail and then snow. It was insane! Myself and a few others had been lucky enough to be under the roof of the shelter as we watched the commotion but other unlucky hikers came running in soaked and cold from the sudden change. This was nothing to mess around with. We hunkered down trying to stay warm and eat before bed. Hikers kept coming in for shelter and were forced to set up tents or hammocks as the shelter was full. I felt so bad!

I curled up in my sleeping bag dreading the idea of having to go hang a bear bag in this weather. NC so far differs from GA in that they don't seem to provide bear boxes or cables at the shelters and instead everyone must hang their own. I managed to sink my cable over a branch on the first try and pulled myself and another hikers dry bags full of food as high up as we could get it. Then, we ran back to the safety of our shelters and did our best to sleep and stay warm. We were in for a long night! The only good thing was we had Rob from the UK who seems to always be in good spirit and made us all laugh at our own misery.","
",Muskrat Creek shelter,"Mar 20, Tue",15.40
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584756,"As we all slowly woke in the shelter, we began brushing off the frost that had accumulated over all our equipment and sleeping bags. These shelters only have three walls so primarily you are at least exposed a little bit to the weather and 100% to the temperature. Getting going was slow. I ran to the privy and as I arrived, Rob was exiting in good spirits unlike most. He said his Hello's and noted that his morning bathroom use perked him right up. It was freezing and he uses water to cleanse his behind! He had poured his near frozen water on his butt at 7am in the woods. What a tough guy!

We struggled to get our frozen bear bag out of the tree and then I raced to pack up and get moving just to stay warm. I was lucky not much of my stuff had gotten wet recently but some people had to sort out their day with wet clothes. Temps were going to be staying around 32 all day and the winds were to pick up by the evening. It was dangerous and certainly life or death for some!

I pushed a hard four miles to the first shelter where I stopped and rested for only a minute or so before getting cold again. Most of us had prepared for cold temps but certainly didn't welcome them and weren't prepared enough. Snow began falling all day and didn't stop until night time. Only an inch had fallen over night but by the end of the day, roughly two or three inches had fallen with drifts of four or five inches.

Again I continued to push to stay warm another 8 miles to the next shelter. On my way I saw many thru hikers headed south bound in hopes of reaching a dirt road gap a little ways back that they hoped would lead them out and into the safety of town. Temps were going to be dropping to the 20's and wind gusts were expected around 50mph or so.

The forecast and north bounders headed south worried me as I continued to hike. I knew that Rob and another hiker named Samesies were aiming for the same campsite I was so that brought me comfort. Weirdly enough, Rob's accent reminded me a lot of Bear Grylls from Man vs Wild and that brought me a lot of comfort thinking I was with a tough, knowledgeable man which he is! Good spirits and laugh also help a lot in miserable conditions. He liked when I told him that too!

We pushed to Carter Gap Shelter where a group of hikers were sheltered from the snow. Three of them had been soaked from the rain and sleet last night but were in a dangerous spot. They needed to get out before the dangerous conditions tonight. They ended up calling the United States Forest Service in hopes of having them unlock a gate at a forest road so that they could get a ride out of the woods. They still had 4 miles until then but it was getting late. The forest service notified them it would be unlocked and that they would be able to provide a shuttle out of the woods for them. Crazy! This didn't make any of us feel better about continuing on but we did anyway. We were smart though so don't worry about us too much.

By this time the group was prepping to walk to the forest road Rob, Samesies and I started hiking together. There was definitely something eerie about being some of the only hikers remaining in the area of trail we were at. Many people had fled to town quick! We hiked the remaining 4 miles quickly and arrived at the lower elevation campsite in hopes of avoiding some of the winds and possibly being a bit warmer. We set up our tents in an alcove of rhododendrons and made a quick meal around 3 or 4pm. It was so cold that just having a non-frozen water source and the ability to have some hot tea really made a difference. From there the three of us all hunkered down in our tents. We layed there for 16 or more hours until daybreak trying our best to drown out the massive wind gusts with our iPods. Luckily we all stayed warm, somewhat dry and safe. Definitely a scary and eye opening experience for us all.","Muskrat Creek shelter
",Betty Creek Campsites,"Mar 21, Wed",16.20
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584758,"On Thursday morning we woke up to still bone chilling temps. The weather was expected to shape up during the day and the winds had died down dramatically overnight. The sun was trying it's best to poke through!

Rob, Samesies and I packed our bags quick and took off. We didn't filter water, barely ate anything and just hoped for the best. We had to climb up and over Albert Mountain in order to reach a gap 10 miles from Franklin where I had planned to catch a shuttle around 11:30 to the hostel I had reserved. We began the straight and tough climb in the snow and ice. This was a beautiful mountain and even with the miserable conditions yesterday we were lucky enough to get great views and reasonably bearable conditions this morning. We trudged up the mountain ""breaking"" trail. Snow hadn't accumulated too much but it was still tough climbing over ice and snow without the proper equipment. The climb up was a quick 2.5miles but steep. On top we took in the views from a fire tower that still stands then quickly moved on once we began getting cold. We had about 6.5 miles left until the gap and that's all we could think about. We made excellent time going almost 4mph downhill. The miles went quick as the downhill was fairly steady. We didn't see any other hikers until closer to the gap where a few had stayed in the shelter overnight. Everyone seemed to group up, at least for the storm, just to stay safe. This was unlike normal when most hikers preferred to hike alone. They were aiming for Franklin as well. By 10:30 we had reached the bottom and were planning on waiting an hour or so for a shuttle into town. However, just as we had arrived, a pickup truck pulled into the parking lot. We heard someone say, ""need a ride into town?"" This was magical. The two people, John and Linda, happened to pull up at the exact time we needed it. Now if any of you managed to read my guest book attached to this journal, you may have seen Linda mention she lives in Franklin and would happily give me a ride once I arrived. I hadn't contacted her and hadn't updated any journal entries yet but by nothing slight of a miracle, they happened to be at the gap when we needed it most. You can't make this sort of thing up! Thank you so much to John and Linda. You guys are angels and the warm coffee and doughnuts they provided us during our ride were icing on the cake. Incredible!

John and Linda drove us right to the hostel I had reserved. We arrived as many hikers were leaving after having waited out the storm. Even then, the hostel only had one spot for myself so Samesies and Rob found an opening at a different hostel. We said a quick goodbye and vowed to go grab some food in a few hours after a shower and rest. What great humans! John, Linda, Rob and Samesies!

I got comfortable at the hostel meeting a few other hikers and one from NH! The only other hiker I had known from NH was Chef Gordan Ramsey so it was nice to know others were around. I took a quick shower, updated the family and began drying things out. The storm had blocked any access for me to contact home either by phone or GPS so it was comforting to let everyone know I was safe and warm.

Samesies, Rob and I met for a few beers at the lazy hiker brewery. From there we went next door for a bite to eat at a cheap diner. They gave us a free sundae just for being thru hikers! We milled about the quaint town of Franklin stopping at the outfitter and trying not to spend all our money. We had a few more drinks at a bar attached to the outfitter! What a wonderful idea! Then I made it back to my hostel by 6 and began journaling and taking care of chores. I ran to Domino's for a $7.99 large three topping pizza for dinner and wolfed down much of it! Man was I hungry. The guys at the hostel were nice and we stayed quiet and went to bed early in the grand scheme of things (around 9pm) but late to hiker standards. A nice warm bunk and mattress was just what I needed. The plan was to go to a free all you can eat pancake breakfast held in town the next morning. The church in town does this every morning for a full month for free including a shuttle to the church! Such wonderful people!

P.S: I'm attempting to do these journals on my phone. Typing is hard so I apologise for grammatical errors especially when my phone attempts to auto correct were to we're!

I will do my best to update the journal at least once a week. It's impossible for me to update in the woods mainly because of phone battery life. My priority for my phone while in between towns is to contact home and to take pictures so unfortunately journaling is not top priority but I do enjoy it just as much as many of you do! Thanks for the support everyone has given me! It means a lot. Today (3/23) I am taking a zero day in Franklin resupplying food, resting and enjoying. I managed to pass 100 miles into the trail on the downhill from Albert Mountain and none of us even realized until we got to town! So pumped! Rain is in the forecast pretty much every day for the next week but I will push on! I will post one more quick journal entry for todays happening tonight before heading back out!

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584787,"Today was a good day of rest. I need to force myself to stop and slow down so I don't injure myself. Franklin, NC has treated me well and I've enjoyed my stay so much! I had a wonderful sleep last night and woke up to the free all you can eat breakfast at the Baptist Church in town! Bacon, pancakes, coffee and legendary orange juice! Amazing! 

I got back to the hostel around 8:30 and did laundry. A small load but definitely necessary with the sock smell and shirt stench. Much needed! I caught up with journals, took care of small chores and enjoyed the morning.

Around noon I received a ride from the hostel owner to the local grocery store. On the way, we stopped at the local dump which seems so simple but offered me more of a firsthand look at local culture. I resupplied on food at the grocery store then walked the mile back to the hostel. I met Samesies and Rob who now goes by green grass (he's always so happy and notes the grass is always greener on the other side so it fits!) at the local restaurant for a grilled chicken sandwich. We drank at the brewery and met other hikers just getting into town at the Lazy Hiker brewery. What a great night! A trail angel from Montana bought five of us beers in good faith that we'd make it to Katahdin! Hopefully! The people in Franklin are amazing.

I took another shower for the hell of it and dried out my tent. I want to take this time to talk about the trail legend named Squatch! Squatch is a southbound hiker who has probably finished the trail by now. North bounders talk about him with a sort of stigma and legend surrounding his name. He is a beast. I passed him a few days ago as I peaked a mountain and he called me bubba. I feel honored. At the moment I had no idea who he was but soon learned. He is a man who wears only a loin cloth and hoodie. His thighs are massive and people say he hiked south in the snow of the northeast. He has been known to just carry a box of frosted flakes and peanut butter through the 100 mile wilderness where you are advised to carry at least 10 days of food through the desolate part of Maine. He rolls into camp, demasculates everyone there then continues on as his legend grows. What a story to pass along! Not sure it is all true but definitely fun to think about! The next Journal update will hopefully be within the next week!","Franklin, NC

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585647,"This morning I woke up to more free pancakes. According to the Baptist Church, if we were staying another day in Franklin, we were EXPECTED to be back for breakfast. They didn't have to tell me twice! I rode the shuttle which we made into a clown car and we unloaded for all you can eat!
After breakfast, we went back to the hostel and prepared our packs for the 9am shuttle. Jumping on the shuttle, everyone was pumped and excited to get back on the trail even in the sprinkling rain. Our shuttle stopped at Rock Gap where we had left off and before we could comprehend the drastic change from society to our reality, we were back in the woods hiking the trail we had become so accustomed to already.
The day went on extremely slowly. Rain came off and on and the temperature was hovering around 40. I hiked for hours looking like a cross between the Michelin Man and the Jolly Green Giant wearing a poncho that covered me to my knees while also draping over my pack. 
I went over the top of Wayah Bald which is a mountain with a grassy top. Signs noted it could be from either insects, drought, disease, fire or settlers who cleared it. Either way, I followed the trail and had no views as the summit was socked in.
Just past the summit a few miles I arrived at the Wayah Bald Shelter which was filling up quick. I claimed a spot in the shelter as other hikers came in. Many set up tents but rain was in the forecast for roughly 7pm so more of the latecomers opted for shelter space. Almost promptly at 7pm the rain began as I struggled to hang a bear bag. My rope kept getting caught in the tree and I cursed myself for not hanging it earlier before the rain. Typically I do chores as soon as I get to camp in order to relax and socialize during the evening. I finally got it after some crazy mcgeivering and hung around for the remainder of the night before having one of the best sleeps of the night! Town is tiring!
P.S: thank you for all the comments on my guest book! Unfortunately I have no way to respond to them directly but I read every one of them! Thank you for the support! I invite you all to look at my photo section as well to check out some of my pictures and see examples of the shelters, trail life, and beautiful scenery which I love photographing!","Franklin, NC
",Wayah Bald Shelter,"Mar 24, Sat",14.80
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585648,"I woke up at Wayah Bald Shelter at roughly the same time as always. The hike today would cover some beautiful landscape and bring myself and the crew I've been with for a while (Green Grass and Samesies) into the NOC or Nanahala Outdoor Center. We we're currently at 4700' in elevation and would peak two mountains both just about 5000' before diving into a ravine where the NOC sits at 1700'. The day was absolutely gorgeous and we scored some awesome views! We hiked through forests that had been plagued with forest fires that were partially linked to the Gatlinburg, TN fires that killed 13 people and caused tons of damage.
The trail at times would walk a ridge line with only 3' of safety before dipping straight down on each side. It was wild! Not only that but the trees had all been burned and the landscape torched into an unbelievable sight. Once or twice the trail seemed to disappear as it descended so rapidly and turned corners at 180 degrees. Such an awesome hike!
The descent into the NOC hurt the knees but nothing to worry about. Everyone has some minor knee pains and for good reason constantly slamming down on rocks. We thu-hikers seem to adapt as we take smaller and more deliberate steps aiming more for dirt than roots or rocks. It helps in the long run. My trail legs have definitely begun to sprout as I can do more miles, faster even with consistent breaks. What used to be a big hike (8+ miles) is a morning stroll and 15 miles is typically the expected amount with 20 easily in reach depending on the terrain and weather. It feels nice and will surely get a bit easier as time goes on.
At the NOC, Samesies, Green Grass, sprout ( a 19 y/o we recently met), Armor (a Dutch man who is the nicest guy ever and wears a solar panel charger on his chest while hiking to charge his phone-- hence, armor) and myself all relaxed. It's a facility right along the river specifically for kayaking. The rapids are awesome here and we grabbed some snacks and layed out on the beach taking in the sun and drying our gear. Eventually, after many awkward stares we went to the restaurant for a proper meal. They usually sit us far away from other guests because of our smell but thats not a problem, we typically like it! I had a full pizza to myself and topped it off with beer. Samesies had to pick up a maildrop she had sent herself at the outfitter and Green Grass had to print his smoky pass. By the time they had finished it was already 4pm so we bartered with the hostel and got a fairly inexpensive room.
The night consisted of us drying our gear out and giving the puppy dog eyes to a group of kayakers also staying the night cooking a huge meal. No luck. Sleeping on a mattress was nice!
P.S: a week or so ago when I was in my tent for 16 hours staying warm during the snow storm I specifically remember listening to my iPod for a fair amount of time. One of the first songs to come on was my boy JT (James Taylor not Justin Timberlake) singing ""Carolina in my Mind."" I remember cracking up hysterically as he sang ""can't you feel the sunshine, can't you just feel the moon shine"" in reference to Carolina, be it, North or South. No JT, I can't feel the sunshine over the wind burn I've gotten hahaha","
",The NOC,"Mar 25, Sun",16.50
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585649,"The climb out of the NOC required us to gain roughly 4700' in elevation over the course of 6 miles. This called for the iPod. I plugged in, put my head down and pushed through the climb. The wind was blowing and the temperature was low so moving was our primary attack at staying warm which benefited us greatly for this climb. We hit another bald peak and the temperature slowly began to rise as the sun got higher! Another nice day!
Green Grass was cruising and by the time I reached Stecoah Gap, he had wizzed right by. I sat for lunch at the gap with a group of other hikers who said that Green Grass had indeed come by and described him as the ""energetic Brit who was dancing with his poles in the air."" That sounded like him!
I met Train Wreck who was a hiker not much older than myself who had fallen down a mountain, gotten a weird rash and broken a trekking poles all within the first few miles of the Springer approach trail. Sounded like his name fitted him haha.
We rolled into Brown Fork Gap Shelter really early and hung out. Armor was here and began building a fire. Once a fire is built, everyone there stays and most hikers coming in smell the smoke and divert course to stay at that shelter. We had a great night and Shiver, Honey Bun and Soothe Sayer reunited with us here later that afternoon! Our mini Tramily was back together!","The NOC
",Brown Fork Gap Shelter,"Mar 26, Mon",16
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585652,"Today we all planned on a very short day over fairly easy terrain. A rough 12 miles allowed us a late start and the opportunity to resupply on food in Fontana Village when we arrived. I hiked the mileage fairly quickly and enjoyed the views of the dam and lake that had been created. We arrived at the Fontana ""Hilton"" early. It's literally noted as the Hilton in our guidebooks and someone took the liberty to create a wooden sign saying the same thing. It's essentially a huge shelter with access to bathroom facilities and a shower. Crazy luxury for us hiker trash!
Green Grass and I claimed our spots inside and planned our trip to town. We got a $3 shuttle ride in and quickly raided the tiny country store in town. Prices were alright except Green Grass accidentally bought two packages of beef jerky each $14. $30 on jerky is crazy but it was an accident!
We walked around the corner to the local gas station and got the last of their nachos with chili on top. The town is TINY! And nothing else was available. We loitered outside devouring our food and waiting for the shuttle. We arrived back at the Hilton overlooking the lake and enjoyed a 6 pack of beer we had bought in town. The rest of the night included charging our phones in a secret outlet in the bathroom, maintaining a terrible fire and hanging out with the 30 or so other hikers as we drank beer an enjoyed the night. The next day we would hike into the infamous Smoky Mountains!","Brown Fork Gap Shelter
",Fontana Dam Shelter,"Mar 27, Tue",12.80
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585653,"Today was the day we entered the infamous Smoky Mountains. Only a week before now, there was a foot of snow covering many of the trails and temperatures were below freezing. Today I woke up inside the Hilton and we had all been graced with 60 degree temperatures and overcast skies calling for a beautiful day on the trails. I woke up with the remainder of the hikers as it's hard to sleep while 20 or more people zip their bags and pack their belongings. The goal really is to get all your stuff outside to pack up out there but noise is inevitable.
I had a honey bun for breakfast and took my snack bag for the day and dispersed snacks into different area of my bag to eat as I hiked. It's been a great system so far and holds me from eating everything in a day. The hike from the Hilton required us to walk along the road and across the dam for about a mile. It was a beautiful morning and the dam provided great views. Shortly after walking past the dam I reached a small board noting the Southern Boundary of the Smoky Mountains. No trumpets, no applause, and not even a Snickers bar like at the start of the AT at Amicalola Falls. Just a small board and a box for thru-hikers to drop their permits in. That was it. Thru hikers must pay $20 in advance before hiking the roughly 70 miles within the smokies. It is considered the most ""policed"" section of the trail where ridge running forest rangers will stop and check your permits throughout the hike. We have a maximum of 8 days to hike the entirety of the smokys and must follow certain rules such as:- staying only at shelters- ensuring the shelter is full before tenting- only tenting around the shelter- forfeiting our spot in the shelter at any time to any backpacker or hiker who has a reservation for the shelter.
There are a ton of rules to follow and that's exactly why the Smokies seem to be a sore subject for thru-hikers. There were many times where backpackers would show up to a shelter around 8pm, which is typically when people are headed to bed or already asleep, and force thru-hikers out of the shelter because they had an $8 reservation. Many hikers seemed to extend their days on the basis that they would show up to a shelter that was full and just be able to legally camp right away without worrying about being kicked out at night and forced to tent in the dark. It creates a fair amount of animosity between thru-hikers and backpackers that seems unnecessary.
As I entered the smokies I immediately felt an eerie presence. I caught a glimpse of two white tailed deer in the distance, heard a woodpecker above me and saw more birds, squirrels and wildlife than the past 150 miles of trail as soon as I dropped my permit in the box. It was like a scene out of Cinderella or something. With the clouds creating an eerie dark glow, I began the butt-whooping climb uphill.
We had heard negative things about the Mollies Ridge Shelter which was the first one within the smokies. Rangers had said that there was already bear activity and rumor was the noro virus had also been present here. The entire group of hikers was terrified of this shelter and bad vibes came off it as I approached. The smoky shelters are mainly all stone buildings with small fireplaces, three sides and a fireplace inside. They would be nice except for the tarps draped over the fourth side and the crazy musty feeling that radiated from them. Walking by Mollies Ridge Shelter, it seemed like a scene from the ""Walking Dead."" There was a laminated sign warning of bear activity, a wooden sign telling hikers to boil all water and it was deserted. Mist was swarming around the structure and I immediately felt the need for large amounts of hand sanitizer. I DID NOT STOP. My hike continued for another five or so miles until I reached my home for the night. I had met a few other hikers throughout the day that noted they all had to chase off a black bear that came to their campsite last night. Over 45min of noise finally got the bear to leave but the two stories together meant no messing around with bear bags and hanging anything that smelt. Being one of the first ones at the shelter gives you good hope of not being kicked out by backpackers unless a group of 20 were to show up. I hung around and waited for the crew to show up as Soothe Sayer and Green Grass appeared. We agreed on taking down the tarp on the shelter to remove the smell and air it out. We kept it down all night in hopes of returning it back to the way it should be. The gang of us all hung around as more hikers showed up and slowly the shelter reached capacity but never exceeded it. We had a great night.
P.S: So apparently Tennessee doesn't allow privy's or outhouses at their shelters. Rumor was they are illegal but I was unable to check that as I write this without access to the internet. Regardless, the shelters within the smokies that fall over the border in TN do not have privy's where the shelters on the North Carolina side do have privys. With that being said, if there is no privy, the rule is to dig a cat hole at least 6"" deep and then cover it after you do your business. I will tell you that that rule doesn't seem to be followed by many as a sign points to the ""toilet area"" near the shelter and small bombs lie every foot or so. It's disgusting and for the amount of foot traffic in the smokies and the popularity of the shelters it amazes me that something hasn't been done about this. This puts the water source at risk for even a Sawyer filter and often seemed to overload the shelters on the NC side of the trail as we literally walk back and forth across the border through the smokies.","
",Russel Field Shelter,"Mar 28, Wed",14.90
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585654,"Like most days I woke up between 7 and 730 to the chatter and noise of everyone else and the sun rising. Today I started out slower than normal and didn't start my hike until 8 or a bit after. The winds were blowing hard and we were high up in the mountains today. I would hover around 5000' for the majority of the day summiting a few mountains.
I hiked three miles or so until stopping at the shelter ahead of us to use the privy. I'm not against digging a cat hole and have certainly done it so far but the condition of the ""toilet area"" didn't make me feel good about it so I opted for comfort. After chatting with a few hikers I continued on fighting the wind on my climbs. I passed more day hikers than most places prior to the smokies and did my best to push myself as I was having a physically hard day of hiking.
I passed two shelters on my hike and they were both empty. I stopped for lunch about two miles before my shelter and had my wonderful lunch creation of a blueberry bagel with peanut butter, pepperoni and cheddar cheese. Mmmm calories! As I sat there I contemplated what I was eating. A blueberry bagel in the heart of black bear country. Definitely not my best move but that seemed to be all they had in Fontana Village. Its almost as if they wanted me to be bear bait. My head was on a swivel throughout my lunch break.
 Seemed like most hikers were headed for double springs shelter which was 3 miles from the summit of Clingman's Dome which is the highest peak on the entire AT. This shelter would put me in a good position to summit tomorrow then descend the other side.  I pushed on and arrived by 3pm. There were already 5 or so hikers here and one of them had started a fire in the fireplace the was inside the shelter. I rested for a few minutes then claimed my spot. Again I was early enough to hopefully not be kicked out later.
At roughly 5500 feet I had great signal and called home to catch up. I milled about, waiting to eat as I did chores and settled in. This is always the hardest part. Waiting for the sun to go down without eating too early so as to be hungry before bed. It's an art to get the timing right. The wind was subdued at the location we were at. This was extremely beneficial as my ear drum already hurt from the harsh winds all day. The only spot the wind hit was the water source. As you crested the hill blocking the wind on your way to water, you were all of a sudden hit with a wall of wind. It was hilarious watching hikers go get water because they would get blasted each time.
Soothe Sayer, Green Grass, Shiver, Samesies and Honey Bun all arrived and each got a spot in the shelter too. Around 6pm, 4 backpackers came and claimed their spots only displacing one thru hiker who had just arrived. We all went into bed as rain began to hit the roof. Not long after a group of 4 backpackers arrived. We all held our breath. The shelter was beyond capacity with a few hikers sleeping on the dirt ground next to the tarp of the shelter. Green Grass, the nice British hiker we knew was still up and took it upon himself to talk to them. We all pretended to be sleeping in hopes of not having to leave. He sweet talked them as best he could and they agreed to tent instead of using their power to kick out thru-hikers. Thank God!
We slept through the night as the fire in the fireplace simmered out and warmed the shelter.","
",Double Spring Gap Shelter,"Mar 29, Thu",16.40
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585655,"On Friday morning we all milled about once again and decided on the best move. The smokies are beautiful but almost every thru-hikers just wants to get through them and out as quickly as possible. I started the climb up to Clingman's Dome in the on and off rain that surrounded the mountain. It was not as grueling as I had expected and I was up there fairly quickly. It's amazing how the forest changes to more pine trees and the smell of Christmas. Much more like NH than it has been.
On top, there was of course no view. I did the ceremonial walk up the actual dome tower on top, took some pictures then continued on. It was cold, windy and wet and I just wanted to get some shelter. The group of us had planned to stop in Newfound Gap, a popular tourist area, to hitch a ride into Gatlinburg, TN for some hot food. Samesies said she was going to stay in town but the rest of us were unsure if we would. Food, however, was irresistible. On the way down to the gap I ran into one of the park ranger ridge runners. She asked to check my pass and I was happy to show it to her. It was nice to know my $20 pass would not go unnoticed! She suggested some restaurants in town and said the 15mile hitch should be easy so I was in good spirits.
I reached Newfound Gap around the same time as Samesies and Green Grass. We entered this parking lot full of people taking pictures of the mountains we had been hiking for the past few days. Coming out of the mountains with mud everywhere and a certain stench and scruffy look got us plenty of weird stares from the well-groomed tourists. I kinda enjoyed viewing society from this different perspective.
We stood around, used an actual bathroom and joined in picture taking. After waiting about 10 minutes, Shiver, Honey Bun and Soothe Sayer reached the gap and the six of us hiker trash made a game plan to get into town. It was only 1pm or so. As we stood there a man approached us and noted he had been called to give a group a ride into town but they never showed. He said he could drive 4 of us in for $30 total and myself, Samesies, green grass and Soothe Sayer jumped in. Shiver and Honey Bun were going to hitch.
We were asked to put on foot booties to keep the car clear of mud. As we entered the town of Gatlinburg I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This town reminds me exactly of Disney World. There are tourist traps lining the streets with ski lifts up the snowless mountains and old western photography at every corner. I had been overwhelmed in the parking lot 30 min ago but this brought it to a whole new level.
The four of us hopped out of the car and payed the nice man. We wore our booties in the parking lot of an outfitter at one of the most famous entrances into the Smokies with our packs and our hiker look. It was truly a sight to see surrounded by the hub of tourist traffic on Easter weekend.
We strolled through the outfitter avoiding spending our entire hike allowance on more gear we didn't need. We then got a call that Shiver and Honey Bun were at the Mexican restaurant already-- No Way Jose's! We had to walk/run a mile with our full packs through the crowd of disney-goers. This was also a sight to see!
We got into the restaurant, devoured a huge burrito then walked to the hotel we had booked minutes prior. It was a one bedroom room with a King sized bed another mile from our location. Soothe and Samesies went and got the key while the rest of us stopped at a corner store for beer and essential foods like Snickers. When we got the go-ahead we all snuck into the room, closed the shades and claimed our spot either on the bed or the ground. I slept on the ground next to the door but all was well for a hot shower and cheap pay.
Later on we met up with a few other hikers at the Smoky Mountain Brewery. We had a beer or two then made the two mile trek back to the room after stopping at McDonald's for a quick bite and a breakfast sandwich for the morning. We don't eat extremely healthy if you didn't get that part yet... Haha
We settled in for the night and prepared for a long hike tomorrow morning.

He is 28 y/o and worked as a bike messenger in London for a few years and now works as a tree surgeon- climbing trees and trimming them. He is extremely fit, always happy and carries an 18lb pack at it's fullest with super lightweight gear and a lot of expertise. He always looks on the bright side and the saying ""the grass is always greener""  seems to fit him- hence, green grass. He's an awesome guy.
Samesies: samesies is 30 y/o and from Chattanooga, TN and works a variety of different jobs the coolest being at a fly fishing resort in Alaska during the summer. She is only hiking until May then will jump off and head to Alaska. Her name comes from saying ""Samesies!"" every time she has the same gear as another hiker.
Soothe Sayer: he is from Bethlehem, PA and formerly owned his own bakery business which he sold prior to hiking. He got his trail name from being someone who tells wisdom on trail
Shiver: she is an 18 y/o girl from NC. She has completed roughly 75% of the trail in a triple yoyo starting NY-ME last year then NY-VA and now GA-VA. She got her trail name because she didn't bring a sleeping bag with her originally and constantly shivered at night. She has one now though! Don't worry!

We made a quick breakfast in the room, scrounged around for our gear then called a ride from the same guy that brought us down into Gatlinburg. He picked us up at 815am and we were on the mountain by 9. Surrounded once again by the crisp mountain air we had failed to reintegrate our bodies to the temperature outside before stepping out of the extremely hot car. The three of us stood there shaking back in reality. We each hiked at our own pace for the day enjoying the minimal climbs and beautiful picturesque ridge lines that define what many think of the smokies. The day started off cold with ice covered trees and wind but turned into a 50 degree day with sun that we were lucky to enjoy. 23 consistent miles ended at the Cosby Knob Shelter where Green grass and I tented while Soothe Sayer stayed in the shelter.

We got up around normal time because it's tough to avoid rising with the sun. We embraced the hiker hobble around camp and enjoyed the sun shining on us once again.
I managed to wolf down 1000 calories in breakfast alone! 450 in Pop tarts and 550 in a honey bun! Amazing! I packed up my tent, planned out my day and vowed for a slow hike. The interior of my right ankle had started to hurt by the end of the day yesterday and I wanted to nurse it without over exerting myself again.
I made it out of camp around 9 (late for my standards!) And made the roughly 8mile trek out to the northern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains. The sun shine and the temperature remained around 55-60 all day! Towards the bottom near Davenport Gap I ran into three horses with their owners! They were volunteers trimming the brush above our heads. I got to pet the horses my favorite being Boomer. Horses are not typically allowed on the AT but they were an exception.
The hike continued and as I neared Davenport Gap I ran into an Easter egg hunt! After all it was Easter! I grabbed a few eggs before making my way into the small gathering of trail magic below. We had all officially hike through the 75miles of the smokies and two wonderful women had brought sodas, chips, candy and most importantly fruit to the gap for hikers to enjoy! What a treat! I devoured food. More than you're probably thinking then hiked a few more miles down hill.
The climb uphill began once more as I went under NC I-40 and passed a variety of hikers and vacationers and roamed the realities of the real world looking like a lost soul on the side of the road as people started at my appearance and smelt my stench.
I climbed another mile until hiking 100 yards off trail to standing bear hostel. This place was literally heaven. They have treehouses you can stay in, resupply, showers and best of all-- a creek runs right through their property perfect for me to soak my aching feet! I couldn't help but stay and I payed for a bunkhouse and a pizza with beer to hangout by the fire. I enjoyed great conversation with the 15 or so other hikers staying and got a chance to catch up with family, look over pictures and charge my phone while performing everyday tasks like filling water, throwing out trash and resupplying. It was a great night and rejuvenated me for tomorrow and the multi day hike into hot springs, NC.","

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585658,"I woke up at Standing Bear Hostel in an old rustic barn to the sound of a Rooster! It was amazing. We all slowly trickled out into the kitchen area where coffee was brewing. I had a wonderful cup with cream and sugar, a plain bagel with cream cheese toasted and of course-- a poptart! It was a wonderful morning for sure. We slowly packed our bags and Soothe Sayer, Shiver, Honey Bun and I all planned on doing 15 miles and sleeping at Roaring Fork Shelter. We had some substantial climbs ahead of us and I continued to nurse my ankle. We all set out at different times knowing we all have different paces. The day was gorgeous with overcast skies and 60 degree temperatures.
We climbed up to Snowbird Mountain which was our first chance to look back at the daunting smokies. Continuing on we eventually reached Max Patch. This is a popular day hike for many so we chatted with many locals as we crested the top of this grassy, bald Mountain. On top, Honey Bun and I got our pictures taken by a nice man then layed on the grass avoiding the winds for an hour or so. It was a wonderful break. We tried our luck at ""Yogi-ing"" which is when thru-hikers attempt to sound desperate for food around day hikers in hopes of scoring some good treats we haven't had in a while. We made great conversation with some nice people but we definitely aren't cut out for begging and didn't score anything.
On the remaining 2 miles of our hike we enjoyed the views of farms and mountains in the distance. I rolled into the shelter around 3pm and was able to grab a nice tenting spot. Everyone is excited to be out of the smokies and able to camp at their own will so tent sites filled up way quicker than the shelter. Hikers continued to roll in and both filled up eventually.
I set up tent, enjoyed the afternoon sun and began eating around 530pm. Two wonderful hikers (one of which had hiked south from PA) had brought a bag of wine and apples. They shared both with us and I hung out drinking red wine and eating a delicious gala apple. Healthy food! I went into bed early in preparation for the 18 miles hike tomorrow into Hot Springs, NC to enjoy a night off and a zero the next day. Oh and a shower+laundry because I smell horrible.","Standing Bear Hostel

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585727,"The rain had held off last night and I woke up in my tent which remained dry all night! That was a nice surprise! As I packed my bag and took down my tent, a group of section hikers camping near me were preparing breakfast. Typically breakfast is rushed for me but they offered me instant coffee to indulge in while we chatted! It was a nice treat as the sun began shining and the temperature remained around 45 or 50 degrees.

I finished my coffee then made my way over to the shelter to eat my breakfast and chat with soothe Sayer, honey bun and shiver who were all headed into town also. We made a plan to call to reserve spots at a hostel once we climbed out of the gap and got service.

We all hiked at our own pace enjoying the beautiful scenery of the day. We had 18 miles ahead of us but the weather continued to improve and by midday it was around 70 at elevation with sun beaming down on us! Flowers had begun to sprout on the sides of the trail and at points, entire fielded areas were covered with small white flowers every 3 inches or so! Really cool to see. The hike continued and by 2pm I began the mile and a half descent into Hot Springs, NC. You could see the town forever but it took so long to get there! I walked off the mountain around 230 and right to the hostel I had reserved. Unlike many other towns, the AT goes right through town making it a wicked convenient stop.

I got in my room and immediately spread my stuff out to dry. I changed clothes and hopped in the shower of the hostel before Soothe and the others arrived. Soothe and I payed the $5 extra for a room to ourselves but like most hostels we still shared laundry and showers which was not a big deal at all. Shelter and a bed were awesome!

As the crew arrived I reunited with Green Grass who had hiked 30 miles two days ago and had gotten into town wicked early that morning. He was planning a Nearo which means a day close to no miles. We planned a zero for the next day which is just a day off. Having done 18 miles made me feel good about taking a day anyways. My ankle felt pretty much 100% better today and I was super excited I had taken the precautions I did by icing and elevating every afternoon! 
Side story: I still remember two years ago when I first started working at Water Country as an EMT. My first year I cross-trained as a lifeguard to learn their protocol and work extra hours if necessary. During the first aid portion of the training we did a trivia game with all the others lifeguards. The director of operations read the question ""what do you use rice for?"" We all blankly stared around and many said ""to put your phone in when it drops in the pool!"" After a minute everyone stared at me and the other EMT and we both had no idea how rice could be used for first aid treatment. Well by rice he meant the acronym R.I.C.E (rest, ice, compression and elevation of course!-- I had learned that in class!) But we all laughed at our idiotic answers and since then I could never forget the acronym. Thankful that I stuck to it!
We milled about, drank some beer then mozied down to the Smoky Mountain Diner as our laundry was running. I ate SOOO much. I literally couldn't walk for 15min after eating. I had a salad! (Finally something healthy--mom!) A burger, fries ann an apple pie with ice cream. It was amazing and well worth it. We made our way back to the hostel for the night and hung around until 10 or so, way past our bedtime! Then we all layed down and enjoyed our sleep.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585729,"A day off! I'm at mile 271 or so and feeling good! Ive been 160 miles since my last day off so I think I'm okay to take one. Most hikers seem to feel guilty taking zeros but man are they nice. We woke up around 730- I can't sleep in at this point- and joined green grass and Armor for breakfast at the same place we had dinner the night before. I had a veggie omelette with home fries and coffee. Such a nice meal! Healthy again!

After breakfast we said our goodbyes to Green Grass and Armor who were headed out on trail today after hiking 3miles yesterday and taking a nearo. It was raining so I give them credit for pushing through. I was happy to avoid the rain when we could so it seems our zero was well timed.

We entered the outfitters where we attempt to not spend all our money. I bought stove fuel which lasts me 1-2 weeks like everyone else depending on how many times I boil. I also splurged and bought two mountain House meals-- chicken teriyaki and lasagna. Those will be nice treats. I finally got some insoles for my boots to try and help my feet a bit.

We each left the store and went our separate ways. I ran to the Hillbilly market (that's legit the name of it!) and resupplied on food then made my way back up to the hostel. There, we all did our chores which include washing our pots and sporks, repacking items, fixing anything that broke, drying everything, planning the next few days of hiking, looking at the forecast, catching up with family, posting journals and tons of other stuff. We really are in the true south that I realized I haven't actually experienced before! It's all so different and cool!

Around noon we decided to walk downtown again, use the libraries good wifi and get any other food for the next few days of hiking and possibly eat more. I'm currently sitting in the library now and it's very nice. Plan for tonight is to eat dinner and sleep then Soothe Sayer is going to cook pancakes and eggs in the morning at the hostel. What a guy! Just a nice relaxing day trying to avoid spending too much money. It's always fun being in town and seeing hikers you know coming down from the mountain and catching up!

I figured I'd take this time to write about the hike in general. The tough and the easy, along with the routine and such.
1. Typically in the morning I wake up and slowly unpack my sleeping bag. I sleep in a 3 degree mummy bag with my water filter so it doesn't freeze, my electronics for the same reason, socks for the next day and sometimes a variety of other gear that is weather dependent. I seem to have gotten a pretty good routine down even in a crowded shelter early in the morning.

2. I begin packing my equipment into my pack once I retrieve my bear bag out of the tree. This is a science that has taken some altering over the past few weeks to make it perfect. My sleeping bag and tent fall at the bottom making sure no buckles face my back as to not dig in while I hike. Next I put my camp shoes and clothes bag and finally my food bag! The most important. In the brain of my pack is my medical kit, guidebook, spork, lighter, water filter, snacks, and a bunch of other smaller things.

3. I eat breakfast. Usually a pretty quick one with water to begin hydrating me. I've already acknowledged my unhealthy eating but I'm definitely not the worst. I pull a snack bag out of my food bag and place snacks in strategic locations to access easily while hiking. This method works well as it holds me to only eating a certain amount without sacrificing all my food.

4. I begin the hike, stopping for breaks every hour or two and eating as I go. Lunch usually falls around 1pm or at a good view with nice comfortable temps.
5. I get to camp and socialize. Every afternoon I clean my feet with a baby wipe and foot powder. Between Abby and my new friend Chris who both recommended it I'm so glad I do. It keeps me blister free and airing them in my sandals allows them to breath.
6. I then pull out my dinner food, prepare my tent or spot in the shelter then filter water. I like doing this in daylight so I don't have to worry about it later and so I can just begin hiking the next day with close to a full 2L.
7. Dinner usually falls around 5-6pm then hanging bear bags and using the privy. Around 7-730 as the sun goes down most of us begin going to bed but sometimes we stay up until 9ish which is considered hiker midnight.
I will say the days can get monotonous. There have been days where you get up with no motivation to hike but pushing myself is all part of the trip. Finding ways to spice it up, enjoying the view and taking breaks really helps with morale and towns are always fun to look forward to. I wouldn't trade this trip for anything though! It's demanding and extremely tough but so rewarding and fun. I'm not usually a  spontaneous guy but the AT forces me to adapt and change constantly while I learn more about myself, my body and have endless amounts of time alone in the woods to think and enjoy. Thanks for the guest book comments and good wishes! I hope I've been able to answer questions and respond to your comments. Check out my photos I uploaded and the descriptions I wrote!

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586028,"Zero days are tough to leave behind. I woke up in the Laughing Heart Hostel around 7 as my bunkmate, Soothe Sayer, began cooking breakfast. He had offered to cook for a bunch of people in the hostel this morning and I think he ended up feeding everyone there! Scrambled eggs with tomatoes and peppers and spiced up pancakes. It was so good!
I left town around 9am and began the climb up. Gaps and towns always mean steep downhill into them and steep ups out. This was no different. Soothe, shiver, honey bun and our newest friend Stoic all planned on meeting roughly 15 miles from town. They all started later but I wanted to go while the sun started heating up the mountains.
I hiked about 14 miles and found a convenience store on the side of the road that the AT crossed. It wasn't on the guidebook but was an amazing surprise. It was a delipatated home with hiker specific foods and treats. I looked around and settled on a Hershey chocolate milk. It was so satisfying! I got rid of the bottle while I was still there then grabbed water. The area I was planning on tenting didn't have a source nearby so I loaded up and got an extra liter.
About a mile from the gap I found a spot. It had roughly 6-8 flat spots for tents and I knew at least 4 more were coming. The weather was beautiful so I layed out and enjoyed while eating some pre-dinner. I eventually set up my tent, hung a bear bag for later then straightened out my gear. By 5, Soothe Sayer arrived and had two others with him- fixed gear and wutang. They all joined in and by 7 we had 8 tents set up and a small fire going. I was happy I grabbed extra water as some didn't have a ton left. We shared our water and planned on filling up at the next shelter 4 miles from our location.

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586029,"Last night dropped to cold temps probably mid 30's. Even then, we all slept well and we were grateful for such a nice spot. I downed a honey bun for breakfast (part of a nutritious breakfast) then started moving to stay warm. I had about a half liter of water left so when I hit the shelter I filtered a bunch and got some for the others who were behind me. The trail seems to have thinned out a bunch and I'm only running into 1 or 2 new hikers daily. It offers more solitude and less crowding but can be lonely. Seeing day hikers is nice though. Shelters are smaller so it works better with less people.
There are shelter registry's for hikers to write in. Each time we stop everyone reads the entries and notices people they have hiked with before. We keep following Green Grass's entries as he speeds down the trail. They are pretty funny and cool to look forward to.
The weather has been looking bad for the weekend and early week. Rain is forecasted for tonight through Monday with temps low during the day and dropping below freezing at night. More snow... Great. We are planning another 18 tomorrow then a 16 the next day to push through to Erwin, TN and see about the weather while drying out, warming up and resupplying. Might be a miserable two days but ""no rain, no pain, no maine""-- maybe snow should be added to that quote.

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586030,"I woke up nice and toasty in my sleeping bag. I would classify today as the hardest day to get out of my bag. Rain pattered on the shelter roof and the air was pretty cold while a 19 mile day lingered in front of us. The forecast looked grim but the rain slowed and only a thick fog remained. We all agreed on doing a 3 mile hike together to a hostel to grab a morning pizza. Mmmm. It really was the only thing motivating us.
We all got up slowly and eventually left around 8:30. Soothe recently bought a frogg togg poncho identical to mine so we sang down the trail looking like two new tellitubies. Eventually we arrived at the hostel as the temperature dropped. We sat outside eating a frozen pizza for each of us as we began seeing our breath. Soothe and I got on our way shortly in hopes of warming up. Cold rain is rough to hike in. I decided to pop in my headphones and crank out miles. By 130 I hit Sam's Gap 11 miles from our shelter last night and ran into trail magic. It really comes at the toughest parts of the hike which is amazing. I loaded up with donuts and a cup of coffee. They gave me a bunch of snacks for the road and again I was hiking to stay warm again.
Halfway up Big Bald mountain I looked up from the trail. Not even 20ft in front of me was a large deer. I stopped and looked around to see 6-8 other deers in this forested meadow all staring at me. I felt like I interrupted an important business meeting. I was standing in my poncho and it seemed the deer didn't recognize me as a human or at least weren't scared of me. They all remained 30 or so feet from me as I walked down the trail filming them. It was pretty cool. Not 100 yards down the trail I also saw 3 turkeys. It was an exciting few minutes!
I made it to the shelter in no time and set up my stuff. Its amazing how the AT works. I literally follow white blazes for miles going up and down constantly. I dont even have to think much and really just use my guidebook to find water, know shelter mileage and have an idea about towns. It's pretty cool. The others were at the shelter within the hour and I was able to change into warm, dry clothes, filter water and do other chores without annoying them by spreading all my stuff out. 30 minutes after my arrival it began raining steadily then transitioning to sleet and snow. I was so happy to avoid the bulk of it.
I cooked another Mt House meal (such a nice treat for a tough day) and devoured beef jerky, a brownie, some cookies, water and two packs of hot chocolate a lot of which I got at the trail magic! I filled up in preparation for the cold night then got ready for bed. We all got comfy and warm inside and prepared for the weather tomorrow.

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586126,"I've finally thawed out as I write this post. That may be a bit dramatic but for a bunch of thru-hikers not prepared for full on winter weather, I'm happy to report there were no issues yesterday and last night. I slept from 8pm- maybe 3am before waking up cold. As mostly everyone, I tossed and turned from 3 until sunrise trying to conserve the heat I had. It dropped to 12 degrees at our elevation of 5000 feet and as much as I like to think im prepared for that, summer-hoping thru-hikers are not meant for these temperatures consistently.

Soothe awoke at 7am and got out of the shelter and ""on the road"" by 730. His plan was to just start moving. I liked his plan. I got up as soon as I could unpack my sleeping bag and muster the might to leave my somewhat warmer sleeping bag.

I grabbed food bags from the bear cables, wolfed down a Pop tart and said farewell to the others. Shiver, honey bun, stoic and wutang were all going to push to Erwin today too and were working on getting out of bed. Fixed Gear, a middle aged man from Puerto Rico that joined us, claimed he was going to stay put until it warmed up and then just hike 10 miles to the next shelter. He didn't seem too happy with the cold.

The morning turned out to be fairly beautiful. Temps were still cold but moving kept it bareable. It was a scene like an ice storm up north where the trees glitter and the sun hits them as snow begins to melt. As bad as we all expected the day to be it turned out nice. I hike about 5 miles then caught up to Soothe. We hiked 5 more together then stopped for a quick lunch and chat. I left before him and by 2pm I hiked right into Erwin, TN and to Uncle Johnny's Hostel. We felt bad about staying at another hostel so soon but we needed to resupply food anyway and we had pushed hard to Erwin getting there a day earlier than expected. And it was cold!

I checked in, got a few supplies then took a bike from the hostel to the convenience store. After some cold nights and long hikes, beer sounded good! On my trip I rode through some Tennessee neighborhoods and even saw a groundhog. Shouldn't I have seen at least something like that in the 340 miles of trail I've walked rather than in town!?!

I arrived back at the hostel and chatted with other hikers over beers. Eventually I made it in the shower then caught the 5pm shuttle to town run by the hostel. We all jumped in and got some nice Italian food. After that we were able to go to Walmart real quick for a resupply then got shuttled back. I put together my food bag, which is a long process, then scoped out tomorrow's hike. I was going to aim for 15 miles or so to a campsite but if the rain started, I would stop short at 12 miles at a shelter. The weather for Tuesday-Friday looks impeccable and we are all pumped!

As I woke up, a cat from the hostel jumped on my bed and joined me in my sleeping bag. It was pretty awesome. I layed there for a bit before getting up. I had bought 7 doughnuts at the store yesterday and we all ate some. Some also had bagels and peanut butter, leftover pizza and tons of different varieties of food. We relaxed in the hostel for a while as we heard the rain was supposed to stop around noon. If we could, we were going to try and avoid it! We had 3500 feet of elevation gain out of Erwin and nobody was in any real rush to do that! The temperature was cool but perfect for hiking so I planned on leaving around 10 and hiking to a shelter 12 miles from the hostel. Then the next few days we could do big miles in nice weather! Well... That's what I thought at least. I had done the math wrong by starting at the wrong mileage. I calculated the distance as 12 instead of 17. The others were all planning on doing the same hike as me today and nobody seemed to realize my mistake!
We hiked along a river for the first few miles then hiked up and up in elevation. As I rose up, I began entering a cloud. The fog took over and eventually I was getting soaked. I put on my poncho and pushed through. At a small gap about 9 miles in I ran into some trail magic! A man from Catholic Charities had pulled his pickup off the road and was offering banana bread, brownies, hot coffee and conversation. I chatted with him and a few other hikers for a couple of minutes until I started getting cold. I really wish I could stay longer more often but weather rules all!
Immediately after that gap I saw a sign saying 8.7 miles to the next shelter. There was no way I had only hiked 4 miles of my ""12"" mile day. I pulled off the trail, scoured my map for answers and realized my mistake. I had messed up. Fortunately for myself, I only had 8 more miles and I was feeling amazing. However, I felt horrible for telling everyone else the wrong number. I pushed on knowing I'd see them at some point. I hiked through the fog and a dense spruce forest around 5000 feet. The climates and forests we go through are all so unique!
I arrived at camp at 3:15. 5.5 hours for 17 miles with 3500 feet in elevation gain and I was feeling great! I set up my tent, warmed up then filtered water and hung a bear bag for later. By the time I finished quick chores, Wu Tang and Soothe had arrived. I immediately apologized and they were really just grateful that it was in fact 17 miles and that their paces weren't crazy slow! We all prepared our sites then started cooking dinner. I had a HUGE food bag so my goal was to eat a good amount. I treated myself to a sweet pork Mt house, hot chocolate, Oreos, a Hershey bar, beef jerky and dried apples! I was eating well. I then cleaned up, brushed my teeth and hung my bear bag with soothe.

Today I was planning on summiting roan high knob then sleeping at the shelter just a little past the summit. All in total, about 19 miles. Roan mt is about 6200'-- just below Mt Washington. We were going to be sleeping at about 6124'. The highest shelter on the entire AT! The day started out with small ups and downs. I stopped for lunch at a shelter 9 miles from our location last night and got a chance to dry out my sleeping bag that had taken on some moisture from the humid, Misty weather last night. I also ate a ton which in turn lessened the weight of my pack! Soothe and wutang rolled in for lunch as I was leaving and I hiked another mile. From there I made the long drawn out ascent to Roan Mt. It was still covered in snow and ice from the past week of weather which worried me. Sleeping at the highest point I didn't know how warm it would be or if the water source would be frozen. I reached the shelter quickly and was the first one there. I scoped out the area noticing the water was still running! The shelter was more of a cabin with two floors and a door to keep out the cold! This meant we would be alright this high up.
The sun was hitting the front of the shelter and I was able to dry some more things out and take in the warmth. I snagged a sleeping spot upstairs where I figured it would be warmer and  got things prepared for later. By then, others were rolling in and eventually the top floor was full and some slept downstairs while others tented. We went in pretty early because of the cold and we all hung around talking. It was warm... Kinda. I feel like we've become accustomed to the cold temperatures now and just deal with it. Don't get me wrong though it's pretty tiring day after day. We get to camp, change into warm dry clothes, mill about, cook an early dinner then get in bed. I wish it was warmer so we could play some games or chat longer but with the weather so cold it's tough.
We fell asleep to the sound of the wind picking up and blowing ice on to the metal roof of the shelter. Tomorrow we lose a lot of elevation, plan on stealth camping around mile 400 then hitting easier and flatter terrain on our way into Hampton, TN for a resupply then shortly after-- Damascus,VA a very popular trail town where I plan on spoiling myself at a B&B or something because that will mark the 1/4 point of the trail!","Curley Maple Gap Shelter

It's crucial for me to keep my nose and mouth outside of my sleeping bag to get the moisture away and luckily I had. However, all night I tossed and turned in the cold. I will admit though it wasn't the coldest I have been. I have my base layer on, a t-shirt, a fleece then I drape my down jacket over me as a secondary blanket of sorts. On my lower body I have my base layer, underwear and pants on and I top off my look with socks and a hat on. Seems warm right? Maybe I just sleep cold. 
I got a later start beginning my hike around 830. I hiked two miles to a parking lot where they had a toilet! It's good because the ground was completely frozen and I couldn't dig a hole! From there I continued hiking as the temperatures rose. By midday, it was probably 60 degrees in the sun not counting the wind blowing probably making it more like 50 at the highest. Warmer than most days but still cold after dealing with the weather for the past week. I'm just ready for the warm weather. Around 7 miles into the day I stopped with soothe and a few other hikers at this place called the barn. It's an old farm barn that was donated to become a shelter. It rests on nice Green Meadows with a beautiful view into the valley. Here I stopped for an early lunch and soaked in the sun's warmth. Would have been an awesome place to stay!
I hiked for the greater part of the afternoon leap frogging soothe and in the vicinity of honey bun, stoic and shiver. We all enjoyed the outstanding views from atop Big Hump mountain and a few other balds. Seems to be a thing down south-- bald top mountains. Did I mention a few days ago we went over Big Butt Mountain? There was even a Big Butt Bypass trail to skip the mountain! We all got a kick out of that!
The mountains today reminded me of the Franconia Ridge Trail in NH. You can see the path you take ahead and all around you is a treeless peak... Minus the rocks. It was cool. We diverted our plan a little and we all opted to stop at a hostel 0.5mi west of a gap we hit around mile 15. They had hot food! I got a Philly cheese steak and we all ended up deciding to stay in the vicinity of the hostel for their infamous all-you-can-eat (AYCE in hiker terms) breakfast. We had heard such great things! I camped on site with Wu Tang while Soothe stayed inside the hostel and the others walked back to the trail and camped for free there. My $10 camping fee got me a shower and dry wood for a fire so I took it! At 8am tomorrow I plan on devouring food then pushing 20 miles. We have about 75 miles until Damascus, VA and I plan on pushing 3 20 mile days or so while the weather continues to be nice then hiking 15 or so into Damascus on Sunday in the rain for a nearo and a zero to officially hit the 25% mark and treat myself at a B&B. So pumped! Checkout some of my photos from today's hike as soon as I can upload them! 
P.S. my Facebook post had originally said 130 miles to Damascus. Again, how did I pass AP Calc? It was about 160 and now it's 75ish. And speaking of throwbacks to NH. I saw a chip in the paint of the bathroom that looked a lot like the state of NH! Super cool haha","Roan High Knob Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586628,"At the hostel tent site I woke up to the sound of the river flowing and an 18 wheeler jamming on it's brakes as it flew down the mountain road. What a difference! I woke up a little later than I expected around 730. Either my watch alarm didn't go off or my crazy dreams and weird sleep caused me to turn it off subconsciously. I packed up my tent quickly and stuffed everything in my bag to get over to the hostel for the AYCE breakfast. I didn't want to be late!
By 7:50 I arrived and got coffee and orange juice before the food was ready. I charged my phone which I had mistakenly left on all night and was now at 18%- dang! When food was ready I was fourth in line. The first plate was home fries, pancakes, a breakfast taco and eggs. Next came biscuits and gravy with more home fries then I ended the meal off with two more pancakes and a few small donuts. Yum!
I began my hike around 9am after walking the 0.5 miles back to the trail. The breakfast must have fueled me because I was cruising. Today's terrain was relatively ""flat."" I say that because even though my guidebook (The AWOL guide is the primary source out here. Anyone considering hiking or wanting to follow me more closely should purchase one!) showed small ups and downs, it's much tougher to hike those than just look at them and think they're easy. Kind of like corporate looking at something and saying it's easy when the ground level guys know it's not.
I hit mile 400 today and at mile 400.2 took a side trail to a water fall. It was awesome! I had been swayed by other hikers writing ""it's worth it,"" ""you're a bum if you don't go,"" or my favorite was someone writing in the dirt ""nature porn"" with an arrow pointing towards the falls. Here I met stoic, had her take my picture and I was off.
Today I wore my bandana in an odd way to attempt to keep sun off my neck. Not only did it do that but I also looked like a pirate which was an extra bonus! The temperature reached about 75 degrees or so and I hit another waterfall shortly after. Each time I took a mini shower in the water and used it to cool my face and wet my bandana. This is what the AT feels like!
I followed a river along the bank bringing me back to my springtime runs in Stanley park back in Westfield, MA. I started getting really excited for an annual kayaking trip that Tom Mulligan, Mike Tryon and Chris Perkins and I have done on the Westfield River every year. We plan on doing it again when I hit MA! It was such a nice day. I took a break around 10 miles on a bench someone had miraculously brought up the trail and placed in a very scenic area then continued on. Eventually I passed the area where the group of us had planned to stay. It was so early, so beautiful out and I was feeling 100% that I left them a note saying I was pushing on at the shelter and continued another 6 miles or so. I eventually reached Laurel Falls,a huge waterfall in Tennessee! It was about 6pm by now so I kept an eye out for a place to tent. I was worried that it was too late to get a spot at the shelter a mile away and apparently there were no spots to tent there. I found a wonderful spot right by the river about a mile from the shelter. I set up my tent, ate dinner, stretched and took care of my feet. Soon enough it was time for bed and as I write this I'm laying in my tent listening to the river nice and warm after a long but rewarding 26 mile day!","Mountain Harbor Hostel

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586632,"Waking up to the sound of the river and waterfall was amazing. However, the sound of water made me have to pee! Realities of hiking and the reality of being in your tent for 12 hours haha.
I woke up around 7:15 and began packing. By 7:35 I was sitting down for breakfast... A poptart! After finishing my rations, I began the hike out of the falls. It was a tough one! The weather was cool enough for pants, a quarter zip and my hat and gloves but as soon as I started uphill I ditched them and was in a t-shirt and pants. Weather today was expected to be about 70 and sunny so I was pumped!
On my hike today I saw few people. A few day hikers headed south bound who were good for a quick ""how are you"" before we passed each other. I may have run into one other thru hiker. Seems the trail is thinning out a lot or I'm in between a bubble. There seem to be a variety of bubbles based on grouping and start dates. We have run into a few so far!
I descended down to a highway in Tennessee that led to Hampton, TN. Hampton looked a bit different from the mountain than the Hampton I'm use to. I was hoping to use a bathroom facility at the gap labeled in my guidebook but it was locked. Must be too early in the year! Either way I took a break on the Sandy Beach at a pavilion. Reminded me a lot of Pawtuckaway Lake! I didn't even see any tourists I could attempt to Yogi. It sure was a lonely day!
10 or 15 minutes later I began hiking again. The trail meandered along the lake side then over a dam that had created the lake. It was nice and the weather was getting warmer. Along the path, a US forest service note warned hikers that the trail was closed to anyone besides US forest personnel, fire, police, EMS and thru hikers because of bear activity. I felt pretty special being able to hike it! The shelter a mile from the beach area was closed too because of the same reason. Even more loneliness! To top it off, the first person id seen in over three hours was a south bound trail runner. Couldn't even get in a hello before he was gone! What a day!
I started up some tougher ascents and by 2pm reached a shelter for a late lunch. On the ridge line looking east I could see a huge cloud of smoke billowing from the trees. Throughout the afternoon it grew in size and I was sure it was a wildfire. I heard helicopters in the distance and when I got to the shelter for lunch I talked with a section hiker about it. Lucky for us there was a river between us and the fire and the AT doesn't seem to go that way but still sketchy. I called home to see if they saw any news about it but nothing so, nevertheless, I kept hiking!
I sweat so much today that my shirt was covered. Water has become more scarce lately and so I really have to plan out my water each day. At streams and springs, people often put rhododendron leaves in the current to create a sort of spout enough to fill up your bottle. It can be tough sometimes. I'll have to post a picture of what I mean sometime.
I hiked on and by 5pm had pushed 23 miles. I cranked out big miles these past two days to make my two days into Damascus a bit easier. As I arrived at the shelter, I realized again that I was alone. This is the first time I've had a shelter completely to myself. I set about doing chores, digging a hole for you know... And preparing for the night. I spoiled myself with a Mt house meal after having hiked 49 miles in two days. I snacked on Oreos and a Hershey bar which are literally my two favorite foods in the world then enjoyed some daylight time with no worries and no obligations after hanging my bear bag. The nice weather has allowed me to dry all my stuff out completely. It even has the faint smell of wildfire to mask the horrid scent. I'm now laying in the shelter listening to the wind pick up and avoiding the smoke in the air hoping this fire doesn't become an issue! The shelter is so quiet void of people that a deer ended up coming down the hill. I stood and watched him for a while. Until he continued on his way.
P.S: I really wish everyone reading this could see the look on a thru-hikers face when they arrive at a gap or road. Even after only a few days in the woods everything seems so fast and foreign. We have such a dazed look and I know it's really weird for myself. 
Thank you John and Linda of Franklin, NC for continuing to follow my hike!","Laurel Falls
",Iron Mountain Shelter,"Apr 13, Fri",23
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586828,"Around 7am I woke up and saw the sunrise from the platform of the shelter I was laying in. Not long after that, a hiker walked past the shelter. I was completely alone here and the sound of footsteps was a bit creepy. He walked by and I said ""hi"" from the comfort of my sleeping bag.
The temperature was a comfortable 50 degrees or so with a breeze blowing. I layed there for fifteen minutes or so before getting up and noticing about 4 deer ambushing the shelter. I had gotten up to pee and grab my bear bag when I noticed the deer. It was super cool, they weren't afraid of me at all! I must be a deer whisperer. I sat and ate breakfast as they grazed
I grabbed my gear slowly and enjoyed the nice weather in the morning. I had cell service and 3g so I spent some time on my phone too. It was nice to get up on my own with no immediate obligations. By 745-8ish I was out of the shelter for the day. Another lonely day today for sure. I crossed some beautiful terrain and very few ups and downs. At one point the AT is handicap accessible for 0.5 miles across a rolling hill at a farm.
The temperature continued to rise and by 11 it was getting hot again but I had done about 12/16 miles for the day so I had managed to beat a lot of the heat. Only by 12:30 did I see the first hikers on the trail. Two thru-hikers chilling by a stagnant stream. I said hi and expressed my happiness for seeing people finally! It's crazy how lonely it can get out here but then again you're back in with a ton more hikers and wishing for solitude.
By 2pm I got to the Abington Gap Shelter and held myself to doing only the 15.9 miles. This was the last shelter before Damascus which is 10 miles away and I wanted to stay here instead of camping further north to avoid having to pack up my tent in the rain. Plus, downtime at the shelter means eating almost all my food! I made the 0.2 mile trek downhill to the water source which was a haul. There I took a mini shower just throwing cold spring water on my body. It was amazing and made me feel a bit cleaner. I came back up and had the opportunity to dry everything out and get the salty sweat stains out of my clothes. It's been a week since I've done laundry too so anything helps. I sat down for my first dinner of pasta sides and fruit gummies. I lounged around more making sure to stretch and elevate my legs. Unfortunately I was back with a few other thru hikers and one was pretty annoying. He just kept talking! Again I complain about solitude and complain about being with people. It's my job out here to learn to adapt.
Night came quick as we talked about the food and drinks we planned on having tomorrow and Monday while in Damascus. You could almost smell the food and we were all so happy to shortly be in town and make myself smell decent again!","Iron Mountain Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586844,"What is a Nearo? Is it below 5 miles? Below 10? Not entirely sure but I do know that the 6 of us sleeping in the Abington Gap Shelter planned on hauling down to Damascus, VA this morning in part because of excitement and in part because we were attempting to outrun a storm. We had impeccable timing! As I woke up, there was a warm breeze cooling us off. It was extremely comfortable weather but off in the distance you could see the sunrise and dark clouds. A storm was coming during the mid morning. Half the crew woke up around 6 and were headed down hill by 630! I myself didn't get out until 7 but I was okay with that.

We headed down hill quickly in hopes of avoiding an uncontrolled shower and in hopes of food and beer. The 10 miles went by so quickly that by 9am I was at the TN/VA border 3.5 miles from Damascus. I made it down to the bottom of the mountain by 10am and only caught a bit of the rain for the last 10 minutes of my hike! I was extremely lucky and even luckier to catch soothe at the bottom enough for him to snap a picture of me under the ""welcome to Damascus"" sign. We waltzed into town and asked to loiter under an overhang outside of the rain. The business owner approved! Damascus is well known as the most popular trail town and so far we were loving it.

We milled about for at least 30 minutes. The 6 other hikers I was with were calling to find a room and I was killing time until roughly 3pm when I could check in at my B&B. I was spoiling myself for sure. They eventually found a spot and headed there to put their gear down. In the meantime, I walked to the only diner I could find open... Mojo's. It was a nice breakfast/lunch diner where I found a spot near an outlet to charge my phone and ordered a Reuben and coffee (weird mix I know but I couldn't decide between breakfast and lunch). I washed my hands for the first time in about 5 days too so that was good! Especially when we just hiked with a man who had to stop because of strep throat!

I ate my sandwich and let my parents and Abby know I had made it. I was on the phone with Abby when my uncle Skip called. Skip lives in Raleigh, NC and had been hoping to meet up with me. Meet ups are so hard to plan because I have no idea my plan more than a day out and weather/conditions change a lot! However, he had managed to track me using the GPS I have and figured it was worth a shot to try to meet me in Damascus. He drove 4+ hours in hopes of finding me without being sure. He even brought an overnight bag in case he had to wait for me! In the middle of talking with Abby I answered my phone. We said hi then he asked where I was. I said ""Damascus, VA!"" And he goes ""Me too!"" It was crazy. Reminded me a lot of Franklin, NC when John and Linda Jones rolled into the gap as soon as I arrived. It was crazy! I paid my tab then ran around the corner of the small town to find Skip! He said he didn't recognize me quickly because of the facial hair but he pulled over nonetheless!

We chatted outside of the car for a bit until the rain picked up. The hikers I was with (Soothe, Stoic, Two Clicks, Duracell and a few others) walked by to meet me at Mojos. They met Skip quickly and I told them I would see them later instead. Skip treated me to AYCE pizza AND salad as we chatted and he told me about his recent cruise and his 50th anniversary! Congrats Skip and Carolyn! Soothe then called me in hopes Skip would be willing to drive them to the liquor store a town over. I felt so bad but Skip was extremely willing. He was definitely a trail angel for them and me as he drove 7 smelly hikers 20 minutes to Abington, VA for liquor. A few of them got some drinks while the rest of us waited. We then dropped them off back at their hotel. 

Shortly after our side trip, Skip and I went to the B&B I had reserved when I was back in Erwin. The Mountain Laurel B&B is a quaint, historical home with original wood interior and stocked full of antiques! It really is beautiful and affordable for a ""treat yourself"" point on the trail. Natalie and Jim who run the place are so accommodating! I highly recommend it!

They gave Skip and I a tour then Skip said his goodbyes. It was so nice seeing him and I'm so grateful for him driving all this way just to hang out with me and deal with my stench. The rain picked up a bit and I jumped in a warm shower and got settled. I came out and talked to a few people on the phone as I sat on the back porch of the inn in a bathrobe with a Guinness the owners gave me in a chilled glass as they did my laundry and I listened to the rain fall. How could today get any better??

I sorted some of my gear and caught up on a few things. I filmed some quick videos to say hi to Aria, Abby's little sister and to the 7th graders at Hampton Academy I had worked with for a few months. Eventually I ran across the street to grab some beer as I hung around and watched TV for the first time in a month. I have a list of things to do tomorrow but I'm so excited to have my own bed, have a fireplace indoors to hangout by, a few cold beers and to be avoiding the crummy weather outside. Excited to hangout tomorrow and get some new shoes, look into a new sleeping pad and to resupply.

P.S: as I write this my mom texted me that Skip was slowed down on his way home because of traffic and because of a Tornado! Crazy! Even more thankful Skip came out and braved some crazy weather. I guess I'm glad I didn't have to hike in any of that! Thanks Skip!","Abington Gap Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586976,"First off, I want to wish my sister a Happy Birthday! Hope it was a fun 21st! All the Sheehy kids are now of legal drinking age! Crazy.

Well I've got to say I'm extremely happy to be in town today. It rained all afternoon yesterday, all night and it's been off and on today with snow squalls starting. Wasn't it just 80 the other day? What's up with this weather!?! I woke up even earlier than normal around 6am at the B&B. I spoiled myself watching the small TV in my room for about a half an hour before doing chores like washing my pot and spork and fixing things in my bag. It was a relaxing morning for sure.

By the time I stumbled downstairs, I joined two other hikers named Don and Jan (trail names are Paddalong and Gramma Shortie) for a cup of coffee and conversation. It was extremely relaxing. We chatted and I learned that Don is an old MA paramedic and Jan taught for many years! So cool! We chatted about life up north. They lived in MA but have a summer cabin way upstate in ME that they go to right near Mt Katahdin. Jan reminded me a lot of my grandmother's and that was comforting.

Kathleen from the B&B brought us our first bit of breakfast. It was scrambled eggs and bacon and she went out of her way to sautee mushrooms and spinach for us three hikers to get us some nutrition. What an amazing woman! I sat and chatted for over two hours with the crew as we were then served waffles with whipped cream, strawberries and blueberries. She served me two because she knew I ate a lot based on my appetite for dinner last night. Home cooking has been something I've missed for sure!

After a few cups of coffee and food, I began walking downtown. On the way (it was roughly a 10 minute walk) Kathleen drove by and picked me up. Even going out of her way to drop me off at the post office! I really can't get over how amazing she is! I ran into the post office and grabbed my mail drop! The first one I asked Abby and my parents to send! It was chalked full of homemade cookies, beef jerky, trail mix made by my wonderful girlfriend Abby and dried fruit with a card in it! Everything was amazing and helped me save money in resupplying!

From the post office I ran over to Mt. Rogers Outfitters. I spent another two hours there contemplating new trail running shoes and a new mattress pad. I ended up buying Oboz trail runners and a thermalite mattress pad (in hopes of sleeping on something substantial and comfortable) along with a new bear line, a small thing of sunscreen and two mountain house meals (chicken fajita bowl! That's a new one!) I definitely helped the small town of Damascus, VA's economy with the amount of money I spent!

After that I returned to the post office to send a box back home. It was distinctly different than the box I got! I put my old, smelly, torn up boots in along with the old bear line, body powder and a few other items I didn't need! Sorry Abby! I was able to switch my pack up so everything is inside the bag except my tent poles and camps sandals. I'm pumped! Worth the fortune I spent!

Eventually I made my way back to the B&B and squared away my gear. I made a quick trip across the street to officially resupply. I spent under $20 which I was pumped about!!!

I got back and repackaged all my food like normal then sat around the fire in the 'sitting room' ( I feel so formal) and chatted again with Don and Jan while drinking hot apple cider and hot chocolate. I am spoiled.

Around 430 I made the trek to town and met up with soothe, honey bun, shiver, baba, Duracell, stoic, two clicks and a few more. We hung around in their hotel room contemplating our dinner options. Almost nothing is open in the small town of Damascus on a Monday night. We ended up going to the Damascus Pizza Company where they had gone last night. I enjoyed a pizza before making the long walk back in the snow that decided to fall. On the way I even saw a plow truck which I honestly didn't think they had down here! Nothing was sticking but it was cold and windy. I said my goodbyes to the others and told them I would probably see them on trail tomorrow. I was hoping to get out after breakfast around 930ish but I had no definite plan!","Damascus, VA

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587345,"I woke up in my small chunk of heaven in Damascus around 7. I put together my gear and brought it downstairs while I sat in the back dining area sipping coffee and charging my phone. The good folks of the Mountain Laurel B&B, specifically Kathleen, cooked me and the two other guests there breakfast. It was their specialty-- eggs Benedict. She also gave me a taste of the corn beef she had slow cooked all night and in which we could smell right in the morning. Everything was amazing!
Kathleen gave me a ride into town where the AT trail ran and I said my goodbyes and thanks for everything. I set off back onto trail around 9. It's so hard reintegrating yourself to the trail and the weather after being in society even just for a day. I began the climb in my new trail runners which felt great. The climb out of town was one of the easiest we have had and I enjoyed the day as the temperature rose. I had to be real careful to pay close attention to my footing so as to not roll an ankle. It's definitely a transition to trail runners from lightweight boots.
The woods were beautiful in VA and by the time I hit roughly 16 miles I was feeling good. I ended up setting up my tent even though I could get a spot in the shelter. I did chores and grabbed some wood for a fire later on. A big group of us met up here and we had a big dinner, enjoyed company and started a niceee fire.

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587358,"I woke up around 7 and grudgingly let the air out of my extremely comfortable sleeping pad. I packed things up and had breakfast before shooting off around 7:45. I began ascending and eventually, after 12 miles, made it to Mt Rogers. This is the highest peak in VA and the AT skirts the peak without actually going over it. I figured I would regret it if I didn't take the side trail to the top. I felt like I was back home peak bagging summits. It still had traces of snow and ice but I found a nice sunny spot for lunch and to enjoy the pine smell. After decending for only 20 minutes or so I hit a shelter where a majority of the crew I've been hiking with were sitting and eating lunch. I joined them as excitement grew in hopes of seeing ponies as we entered the Grayson Highlands. We hiked along as a group and eventually ran across one that was running off. Slider, a girl in the group, carries a trombone. She began playing but the horse didn't seem to care!
We hiked another mile or two before running across two ponies grazing on the trail. They are completely wild ponies but they are really use to people. We didn't feed them at all but they were eager to lick our hands and have us run our hands through their manes! It was sooo cool!
We hiked another 2 miles together before Honey Bun was able to meet up with his father who was here to visit with him. We called him daddy buns or papa buns. He had a picnic blanket laid out with fresh fruit and other treats. We stayed here for over an hour soaking in the sun and warm weather while chowing down.
We thanked his father then moved on to the next shelter where a group of ponies were grazing! We did chores and ate dinner before everyone was in bed tired out by the sun. The ponies grazed close by and the bear bags we hung seemed more like pony bags. Weather is expected to be colder again tomorrow so we were all preparing for the cold.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Waking up with the rest of the hikers in the shelter was tough with the colder temperature and high winds. Eventually I made it out and started my morning. I began with a nice fall onto a rock and difficulty warming up but once I shook off the morning blues, the day turned out nice!
As we crossed a bald around 8am, the wind was gusting around 50 miles an hour and literally blowing me off the trail. After powering through it and laughing with the other hikers who had just finished the peak too, I pushed on. I saw a few more ponies along the way but the weather was too cold to stop.
I ended up stopping with two clicks for lunch and having a peanut butter, beef jerky tortilla and cooking some hot coffee (thanks Abby!) It's been so hard to adjust to weather because every other day the weather is nice then the others it is freezing. I was getting used to mild hypothermia!
The remainder of the day I hiked with two clicks and flash. Two Clicks is a 26 year old from the South shore of MA. He works as a carpenter and has hiked the 48's 3 times! 1 in the winter! He's now working on red blazing the whites which is pretty sweet! Flash is a guy originally from Bar Harbor, ME who worked IT for embassies across the world for the past few years. He is usually really fast but is nursing an IT band injury. 
I got a spot in the shelter and ate some food along with some hot chocolate. Plan tomorrow is to go get pizza delivered at a shelter for lunch which sounds awesome then the next day resupply on food.

Once one person starts, it's hard to sleep past that so I just begrudgingly follow! Today I was out by 7 or so. The group of us were originally planning on hiking 10 miles to the Mt Rogers visitors center and the shelter right next to it and ordering pizza delivery for lunch! Yeah they do that! But after hiking the ten miles I arrived and Soothe and Two Clicks told me the shuttle to town was on 50 cents! We changed our plans which allowed us to get a hot meal and resupply all in one. Right before the shuttle left, a nice thru hiker gave me a free Pepsi!
We sat at the visitors center for about 45 minutes doing the classic hiker things-- charging all devices in a small outlet, ""showering"" in the restroom and finding out information. At 11:15, the shuttle arrived and we went into Marion, VA. The driver was crazy! Drove so fast and almost blew through a construction site. We survived though.
In town we all made our way to a Mexican restaurant. I made a terrible mistake in the rush of everything to leave my wallet up at the visitors center. So stupid. Luckily I called the nice woman at the desk whom I had been chatting with before leaving and she was holding it for me! So lucky. Won't do that again.
Stoic covered me for Mexican and Soothe covered me in Walmart for resupply. Thanks guys! I paid them as soon as we got back. Of course after resupplying we had 45 minutes until the shuttle came back so we were the typical Walmart bums and charged phones at outlets while sitting outside! We really are pathetic haha.
Once the shuttle dropped us back off, we did what's called a hero. It's a trip into town to resupply then hiking more than a few miles afterwards to camp. We all cranked out 6 miles in under 2 hours and arrived at a fairly primitive shelter. The privy was closed and there were few to no good tentsites. I considered pushing on further to a settlers museum another mile ahead that allowed camping but I stayed! I pitched my tent as most the others squeezed into the shelter. During my resupply I bought smores stuff and took the time and effort to make a fire and provide smores to everyone. I ended up eating about 15...
We had a nice night around the campfire with smores and I was given a bit of whiskey which was great! A solid night.","Trimpi Shelter

On these 4 miles we passed some cool sites! The first was the settlers museum which opens an old school house to hikers to sleep in, tent at or to just take a break. It's really cool and an awesome place. I used the privy here then explored the inside. It was open as a school until 1937 and now sits on museum property. The local hiking group keeps it stocked with trail magic including food, cold drinks and toiletries! I grabbed a Gatorade and a new toothbrush while Soothe grabbed a small carabinier he needed. We took pictures and admired the place. It was really cool!
After that we passed along railroad tracks and entered the outskirts of Atkins, VA where there are two gas stations and The Barn Restaurant. As a group we went into the restaurant and had breakfast. We all ate so much but felt super bad for the waitress who was on her own with probably 15 hikers and a few locals. Food was good but they didn't allow us to charge our phones inside? Only outside? Seemed strange. I was the rebel who hid my phone under a hat and managed to go unnoticed as it charged.
After breakfast I hit the trail hard. I always do so well with good food in me. I traveled across a bunch of rolling hills and up and down small mountains. The terrain wasn't too difficult but had it's tough sections. It was really beautiful though and the sun was shining and it was around 70 degrees after a cold 32 degree night.
I hiked through a bunch of easements that the AT has over private property. There were signs warning us to stay on trail unless we had written permission from property owners. We all had no issues though. I continued hiking and ran into a few section hikers. They were more specifically LASHers which stands for Long A$$ Section Hikers. Two older guys hiking that were fairly nice. They talked to me for probably 20 minutes even though I was itching to move on. Unfortunately though the AT is typically only big enough for one person to hike and they weren't letting me pass. Eventually I managed to get by and said my goodbyes! Then, as I turned the corner, their friend was standing in the trail apparently taking a picture of the valley area. He turned his camera as he saw me and took a picture of me traveling down hill at him probably from only 10-15 feet away. He didn't say a word as I awkwardly said hello so I just moved along at a bit quicker pace. Very strange. I know I look like an animal but please, no pictures! Haha
I hiked with two clicks for the afternoon after taking a late lunch and we reached a campsite that they had all planned on stopping at. I was feeling good and it was only 4:15 so I decided to push on another 3 miles to another campsite. This would give me the chance to sleep in! But I think I made the right move. I arrived at the campsite in under an hour and found honeybun sitting there. We chatted and I returned to him his official thru hiker tag given to him at Springer mountain. He had dropped it along the way but it was finally reunited. He wasn't feeling great hiking today but pushed on another 5 or so miles with Stylo to a shelter. I pitched my tent across the stream from a few section hikers and settled in for the night. I had a pasta side with black beans added in and 3.5 servings of pre cooked chicken. I know I've lost weight but I'm really trying! Ask anyone, I'm a big eater but I just can never get enough out here and anything I want I have to carry so it's been hard. I promise I'm eating the best I can! More than a lot of others! I followed dinner up with dried fruit, a protein bar, goldfish and a Hershey bar. It was a great dinner and I attempted to plan out the next few days of hiking. Still unsure but I'll make it work!

It was a really peaceful morning and I began to gather my things. I made it 6 miles in 2 hours with 2,000 feet of elevation gain primarily because I had to use the bathroom and I was being lazy and didn't want to dig a hole. Luckily, it was open at the shelter at the top! 
Today was cool! The shelter 6 miles in had amazing views over what I believe was Bland county Virginia. It wasn't that bland! Apparently, there was an asteroid or comet that hit this area a long time ago and made the indentation I was looking at. For the majority of the day I would be walking along the ridges created by this hit. Pretty cool! I had amazing service up top and called home and made a few texts. Then I began the descent.
I started hitting a wall around mile 10. It wasn't terribly difficult terrain and the weather was nice but it just wasn't a great day for me starting out. Until.... I passed some day hikers alerting me of trail magic ahead! I think I ran the next mile to the gap and arrived to find a man and a few hikers huddled around a propane stove with a pan. On it... Pancakes! Woo! He informed me he was sick of cooking and that if we wanted some we had to cook them ourselves. No big deal! I cooked up four big pancakes and threw them in my jetboil pot. I then doused them with syrup and ate it like soup. It was amazing! Then I washed it down with some canned peaches. I informed the man (unfortunately I forget his name) that I was hoping to get some resupply enough for one day at the next store. At that, he opened his trunk and let me pick out the foods I needed! What a huge help. I said my thanks after leaving and continued on. That really boosted me for the rest of the day.
I climbed up and down in 600 foot intervals for the next 15 or so miles with a few moments of ridge walking. It wasn't a bad day of hiking after breakfast, or for me, pancake peach lunch. Eventually I hit Laurel Creek Campsite where I filled 3 L of water (roughly 6 lbs) enough for me to drink and cook with later. I planned on stealth camping somewhere before VA 52 where there is a deli I could get breakfast tomorrow (they are closed sunday--- Bible belt!) There was no recorded water for the next 10-12 miles so I made sure to fill up and suffer the weight penalty.
3/4 of the way through this 8 mile stretch I caught up to honey bun on the side of the trail. I had been reading his log book entries and hoped I would see him. He had the same idea as me so we hiked another 2 miles or so and ended up going further than planned because there were no camping spots! It was all very hilly. We eventually made it to VA 52 and saw the deli we wanted to eat at for breakfast. With not many other options, we pitched tent under two trees 3 feet away from a 100 foot drop down to VA 77-- a very major highway from the looks of it. One wrong move and we would fall a ways but what else could we do, we really wanted a good breakfast haha. We were only 50 feet from the store hidden away and would be able to jog over there at 8 when they opened and grab breakfast before hiking in the rain all day. We cooked dinner, did some chores then laid in bed listening to the sound of motor vehicle noise. We both agreed this was the craziest spot we had tented at before. The benefit... No need for a bear bag. If a bear made it here, he/she deserved our food!

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587973,"Waking up to the sound of 18 wheeler air brakes the day after Earth day was odd. What a weird coincidence that on Earth day we slept in our tents overlooking a highway after having been in the woods for almost a month and a half...
I woke up and made reservations at Woods Hole Hostel for two days out. I packed my tent and by 730 I was hopeful to walk over to the store and get in early for breakfast. As I crested the hill I saw baba, soothe and buckeye packing their tent 50 ft below us also overlooking the highway. They had gotten in at 9pm after a 30 mile day and camped right near honeybun and I. Not only that but two clicks, slider and our friends gram and Grant now called Gramps and Sani had all left a campsite 7 miles back at 4:30am to get to this store at 8am as well. Crazy! Our little Tramily/hoard had all reunited for the hopes of food!
We got into this small store before 8 and the owner began serving us with the biggest smile on his face. He had just made a quick couple hundred dollars before the store even opened. We had the classic biscuit and gravy with eggs and bacon. A hot breakfast helps a lot! I even ordered a burger for dinner that I took to go on my 27 mile soggy hike.
I took off from the store at 9:30am. I was worried it might have been too late of a start to successfully get to the shelter with daylight left. My motivation all day though was the dinner burger and running from the rain. The wind continued to howl and the skies looked dismal but it didn't start raining until 1230 or so. Even then, the heavy rain didn't come until 230. I was able to put in some big miles prior to the rain.
By the time the rain started hard, I was walking through a tunnel of rhododendrons that helped block a lot of it. The problem was though, when the rain did die down, the rhododendrons kept the rain dripping so it never really ended for me. I was wet and tired but I pushed hard and got to the shelter by 530. 27 miles in 8 hours! I was pumped!
At the small shelter, we were able to fit 6 people even though it was meant for 5 the problem was that our entire hoard was headed here so almost everyone had to set up tents. I got a spot in the shelter with Flash, Slider and Duracell and then two section hikers. We were sleeping in the same name of the shelter that two people were murdered in back in the 1980's I believe. They have since torn that shelter down and built this one in a different location but they kept the same name! It was a bit creepy but there were a lot of us. Cool to say though... I've slept in the highest elevation shelter and the one where two people were murdered. I'll add it to the books!
The others rolled in as I downed my burger in a minute flat along with any other food I could out of my food bag. I stuffed my face and even though I was cold and wet, I decided not to cook tonight just because I wanted to sit with my feet in the sleeping bag out of the rain. I slept very well all night.
P.S: The last few 100 miles have been fairly strange and I didn't really realize it until we all got together and chatted. There has been a man named low gear consistently spotted on trail. He claims to be a trail angel but also has weirded out a lot of hikers in our group. Honey bun was the first one to encounter him. The man poured him an individual glass of Pepsi and gave him three Doritos as trail magic-- strange but not that weird I suppose. Two Clicks and our friends who I believe are Australian, named Polaroid and soul sister also reported being followed by him. Two Clicks passed him going north while low gear went South until they passed each other. As soon as he passed him, low gear turned around 180 degrees and followed him. Two Clicks picked up the pace as the man continued to stay right behind him until two clicks said ""what's up man"" and low gear replied ""I know these woods really well."" Polaroid and soul sister reported being followed as well and by the time they lost sight of him behind them, he was standing up the trail in front of them. What makes it creepier is he has a 6 inch knife hanging perpendicular to his chest strap clearly visible AND the man who gave us pancake trail magic reported finding an unattended day hiking pack full of a wallet and phone off trail in the same general area we've seen this man. He reported the bag to state police and they said the hiker it belonged to was supposedly hiking south to Georgia last his family knew. All these different interactions put together really raises flags. Today, we learned that another few hikers had a similar experience and called the sheriffs on him. They reportedly have a file on him but he hasn't necessarily done anything illegal. I, myself, only had a quick interaction with him where he asked if I knew who he was and was surprised I didn't. It was quick then I began hiking north as he continued south but definitely puts you on edge. Plus sleeping in a shelter where people had been murdered way back didn't make it any less uneasy! But don't worry, I'm safe and moving north away from this sketchy section!","VA 52
",Wapiti Shelter,"Apr 23, Mon",27
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587974,"At 6am sharp, movement began in the shelter. Slider was the first to make moves by letting air out of her mattress. Once that happens, sleeping is out of the question. Somebody's alarm kept going off too. Not cool. Regardless, the rain had let up and there was enough light to see so I got up in hopes of just cruising to the hostel and getting warm and dry.
At 7am I took off. The rain was still holding off and would do so until about 830--- I got really lucky! Two Clicks and I hiked the last mile or so together and rolled into the hostel really early around 930. We took our bags and shoes off as we entered to attempt to get dry, warm, and figure out what the owners wanted us to do. We had heard so many great reviews of this place that we were all so pumped to be here. We got the run down and claimed a bed. Immediately we got started on chores. I took a shower and then two clicks, Slider and I shared a laundry bag to save money. I washed my pot, and started to spread things out to dry too. It can be a difficult process but eventually I was comfortable rocking some loaner clothes around the hostel as our clothes waited in line to wash.
I ordered a homemade smoothie and a loaf of fresh bread to snack on before they brought in cookie bars to the bunkhouse. All of us devoured them as we sipped coffee. The unfortunate part about the hostel is there is no cell service this far out, no wifi, and town is too far away to realistically go to and we can't drink alcohol here. I made the best of it and used the day more as rest. We ate lots of food, stayed nice and toasty by the wood stove and played board games and read books. It was really nice!
At 530 I helped Neville, the owner, cook dinner with a few other hikers. I went out to the gardens in the rain and helped her pick lettuce and kale for the salad. Their whole business is based off sustainable living and the meals are so fresh! I went back in and helped chop apples and prepare more food. We all got together around 7 for the first round of food. She served fresh bread with the apple salad and homemade dressings. With that, we had fresh made hummus and egg salad. I had two servings of everything and this was only the first round. Next, we got fresh made chili with sour cream and fresh cheese from the farm. I wolfed down this whole plate and wiped everything down with more bread. I probably had 2 whole loaves of bread today haha!
The final ""course"" was a fresh baked cookie. It was Slider's birthday yesterday so Neville attached candles to them and we sang. Baba ganoosh's grandmother also turned 93 today so with their special phone that was the only one with service, we left her a voicemail too. After dinner we helped clean up then made our way back to the bunkhouse. The peepers were extremely active along the creek running through the property and we all were extremely happy and full. I only wish I had been able to call back home. I enjoyed the last few minutes before bed laying down thankful for a warm meal, warm bed and a shelter over my head as the rain continued. ","Wapiti Shelter
",Woods Hole Hostel,"Apr 24, Tue",7.20
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588293,"Woods Hole Hostel won the hearts of all of us in the group. The morning breakfast was eggs, sausage homemade from the farm, fresh peach cobbler, special apple and strawberry jam Neville had made and more bread!!! Such a great start to the day. We all helped clean dishes and the bunkhouse before squaring up our bills. We were all headed for Pearisburg, VA only 10 miles away on trail for a proper resupply. We couldn't resupply here so we had to do another modified nearo in order to do so. The hike was fairly uneventful except for the off and on rain. As I dropped down in elevation I came out of the cloud of fog that plagued the mountain and caught sight of Pearisburg as the surrounding became more green and flowers were beginning to pop. We had all joked we were hiking to Paris--- burg! And staying at the Plaza---- motel. All of which was true. Slider was going to have her birthday celebration in Paris at the Plaza haha.
I arrived and walked the 0.9mi into town. Unfortunately there were no cars headed the right way on this back road for me to hitch so I walked. In town I met up with Sani, Gramps, Two Clicks and Slider at the Mexican restaurant across the street. It seems that every town stay involves a Mexican restaurant! I ate a cheap burrito with a Corona in hopes of saving some money then went to the Food Lion for resupply. I got ripped off but I'm trying to eat more without adding weight to my food bag.
I got to the motel and sorted my food. I always separate snacks into days so I don't over eat and I'm so glad I do as I watch everyone struggle. I've recommended it though! From then on we all hung around the motel drinking beer and having a cake for Sliders birthday two days ago. When most went for round two at the Mexican restaurant, I stayed back with Baba, Honey bun and Two Clicks and watched a knock off ""Planet Earth"" while laying down drinking a beer. It was very relaxing. Everyone ended up staying up until midnight which was rough because I'm used to 8pm bedtime but I made it work and survived. Off to the trail tomorrow morning!
P.S: I'm hiking with Gramps whose real name is Gram Duda. I mention this because my mom's family name is Dooda and we used to call my grandmother ""Grammy Dooda."" Such a weird coincidence.
I also want to mention that the other night at Woods Hole Hostel as we were sitting down for dinner, Neville learned of a lost hiker. We had slept in the same shelter as two section hikers the night before and only one had made it to the hostel. We were under the assumption that the missing hiker was the other section hiker. Well, they ended up finding him eventually even with the rain and fog and getting him to town and in a motel. What was weird about this is that his hiking buddy who was also sectioning didn't seem phased that his friend never showed up and as we asked about the missing hiker he almost seemed bothered that we were all talking about it. Wicked weird! 
To follow up on the Wapiti Shelter murders, I did some research. If you get scared easily I would STOP READING. Back in the 1980's two hikers, a guy and girl befriended a local. They went to sleep in the former Wapiti shelter and when they did, the local shot the man first then the woman woke up and began running. She was stabbed repeatedly and both their bodies were found weeks later in shallow graves stuffed in their sleeping bags nearby. Items were also found scattered around the wooded area. Eventually the man was caught in South Carolina and pleaded out to 2nd degree murder. He ended up serving 15 years which for some reason was what Virginia law required or something like that. Once out and back in town, he continued to hike the AT. Eventually he did something similar to two fisherman in the same area near Dismal Falls and Dismal Creek, both of which the AT still pass by today. They were able to survive multiple gun shots and call for help. The man responsible was again arrested and died as soon as he got to jail. Crazy story! They rebuilt the shelter and relocated it but for some reason kept the name the same. I shouldn't have looked so hard into this before bed but I think it's so interesting and I still slept well! ","Woods Hole Hostel

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588294,"Let me start off by saying Dairy Queen does not have a good breakfast. I didn't even know they served it but they do. I ate a biscuit sandwich with bacon... No egg. I made it work though haha.
After my breakfast and after cleaning the motel room, I walked the 0.9mi back to the trails and was started up by 8:30. Two Clicks had left before me and the others weren't planning on leaving until later and only doing a short day. It started out beautiful, warm and sunny. Early on I passed fairly close to a factory. After a second I heard alarms going off and thought something was happening. Fortunately, it was only a drill but from the mountainside you can imagine my fear. I made it up the big climb of the day before noon and then walked a ridge for a good portion of the day. Along the way, I talked with a really cool sheriffs detail posted at a gravel road. Apparently there is a pipeline being constructed that will be crossing the AT and there are a bunch of protesters. His job is to inform all hikers that we must stay on the trail for the portion we pass near it. Of course I don't want to see a gas pipeline going across a beautiful section of the AT but I don't know any of the details and am pretty ignorant to local and national news as of now. Plus I would love to keep politics out of this. So for the next few miles I saw signs of protesters camp, a few people milling about and ATV tracks that had ruined portions of the AT. Not sure if they were the protesters ATVs or the pipeline project but, regardless, motor vehicles aren't allowed on the AT and it's government land so that was annoying. Otherwise, no problems.
I pushed on throughout the day extremely tired from last night. Two Clicks and I were breaking away from the group slightly and doing a pretty decent sized day of hiking. About a mile from the shelter I had a 1,000 foot climb left. 1,000 feet in a mile after 23 miles done was just icing on the cake. I made it though and because we broke free from the group, it was only Two Clicks and I with two section hikers who were nice. It began to rain and was scheduled to do so all night so we were happy in the shelter. We ate and did chores then I was able to lay down, hangout, look at the mountain profiles for the next few days and catch up on journaling. It was relaxing as I listened to the rain fall.
P.S: Although we all remain fairly unaware of national and local news because of our distance from society and the fact that we all simply don't want to hear about it, I did hear about what happened in Maine. I extend my thoughts and prayers to the officer and his family that was murdered and hope the party responsible is caught quickly. To all my LE friends, stay safe. And congrats to my friend Corey for graduating the NH Police Academy fairly recently! And to my former roommate Nick Paquin who has been hired by the Keene, NH Police Department! ","Pearisburg, VA

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588296,"This morning was foggy and cold. The rain had continued falling lightly all night but had died off now. I slept amazingly all night and woke up feeling fairly refreshed!
The hike in the morning started out on Ridgeline. Rocky Ridgeline that had been soaked the night before... It was slow going. Eventually I caught up with Two Clicks and we ended up hiking together pretty much the rest of the day. I learned he was friendly with one of my former roommates in college, Zach Howard. Small world for sure!
We pushed on further and went over Kelly Knob. It was a cool rock outcropping with views of the valley and the dark clouds above. The sun kept hiding all day, in and out.
On the downhill before our last climb, we hit the second largest tree on the AT. The only tree that beats it is in NY somewhere. It was massive! Apparently 18 ft in diameter. On the next Ridgeline, we hit the Eastern continental divide where water to the east flows to the Atlantic and the west to the Gulf of Mexico. Really cool!
We finished our long day as we neared the shelter. We were pumped to see nobody else there. We did our normal camp stuff, soaked our feet in the creek and tried different varieties of food. Eventually we had a great time hanging out and resting. Two Clicks and I are big on static stretching and cleaning our feet after a long day so it's nice to be with someone who has similar thoughts on that. Looking forward to a slightly shorter day tomorrow over Dragon's Tooth putting us one mile from the top of Macafee's Knob for sunrise on the 29th then Pizza Hut and a town hero in Daleville the next day!","Bailey Gap Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588390,"The AT really does take me through a crazy variety of different landscapes. One moment I can be on 'normal' summits, the next on rocky knobs followed by marshland or rolling Meadows. It's amazing and that's what made today so great.
The morning started out waking up to the sounds of birds chirping and the warm sun rising. We slept at only 2000' so it wasn't cold or anything! I zipped my pants off into shorts and took off my layers. Sunshine and Two Clicks took off before me so I had time to eat breakfast in my sleeping bag and do some dynamic stretches which I usually bypass in the morning. I felt no rush and took off when I was ready.
I jumped over a few creeks and rivers in the lower valley then hiked up Brush Mountain. Finally, Virginia gave us our switchback climbs back and the climb was fun and easier! Even when gaining 1600'. I passed by a family thru-hiking. There are 6 kids aged 2 years old to 14 years old or so with their two parents. That's crazy!! On the top of the mountain, there was a memorial for Audie Murphy who is the most decorated veteran from WWII. It was an awesome memorial.
I descended then ascended once again just like every other day on the AT. The weather was beautiful around 70 or 80 degrees in full sun. I hiked up to Dragon's Tooth which is a popular tourist destination. We eventually hit the top where a massive rock lays that is in the shape of a dragons tooth. It is at mile 701 which is just another milestone for us! It was really cool but a tough hike and after 5 minutes the novelty of seeing so many day hikers wore off. Eating lunch like an animal while people watching was fun but nobody even had backpacks to Yogi food off of and most people seemed to have no idea what the AT even was! They were just hiking the 2 miles up and wondering why we were carrying full backpacks. It got old quick.
The AT eventually broke free from the societal rut of day hikes back to the regular loneliness of the woods. It's amazing how accustomed I've become to being alone and comfortable out on the trail by myself. It's also really cool thinking about the small society we thru hikers have created and maintain by looking after each other.
The next set of terrain after the Rocky top of Dragon's tooth was a few miles of rolling Meadows. I really love these sections because I'm not use to them being from NH and they offer amazing views and the smell of fresh grass and cow poop... Which I like. Weirdly or not.
Finally, we connected back to one of the most touristy sections in the area... Mcafee's Knob on a warm, sunny Saturday afternoon. Two Clicks and I rolled into the parking of this popular hike around 3:30 after having hiked 23 miles. We found a stash of trail magic cold drinks and snacks off the side of the trail and literally devoured food like animals while crazily staring down tourists. It was a sight to see for sure. We were so hot and tired that the cold Gatorade and drinks some nice person had left really boosted our spirits. We ate our fill and took more for later because there was so much. To finish the day, we hiked another mile or two up to a shelter.
On arrival, we noticed more hikers. I'm not joking when I say we could tell they weren't thru-hikers by their smell alone. That's the power of pinesol baby. Anyway, we were able to snag two spots and these guys were really nice! They gave us extra snacks and even salted caramel chocolate bars. I felt bad for cursing day hikers all day. We hungout with them all night and enjoyed having phone service and bear boxes once again. Oh the wonders of touristy areas!
To end the night we told our scary stories of southern VA to the day hikers and listened to a few of them and their plans to hike the PCT in the next few years.

It is the most photographed point on the AT so we had to do it right! We also hoped to avoid the crowds but unfortunately people still flocked to the top this early! In the low 40 degree temps we braced the wind and cold to get good pictures. I kept telling myself ""do it for the vine."" Close enough, right?
The sunrise was beautiful and my coffee I had while sitting at the top was just as great! Shortly after 6:45 when the sun had officially risen (Hashivenya! Babalisibalo! You know-- lion king?? It seems phonetically correct!) Two Clicks, sunshine and I hiked on. We altered plans and hoped to stay in Daleville, VA this evening instead of stealth camping outside of it. That way we could eat barbecue, get a pizza and resupply. 
We had hiked 2 miles by 6:30 and had about 15 left. We climbed over Tinker Cliffs which gave us 0.5 miles of cliff walks then hiked a ridge before dropping into town. On the way down, Two Clicks nearly stepped on a massive snake sitting on the trail. It flattened it's head when I put my trekking poles near it and appeared venomous, probably wasn't knowing our luck. But, it gave us an excuse to act like excited children for a few minutes.
Once we entered town we stalked the busy street comparing hotel prices. We had met up with a hiker named Speedy and the four of us teamed up to split a hotel room. We ended up at a Howard Johnson's for $15 a pop. Wifi, shower, bed, shelter and free breakfast for $15! Woo! We each showered up while charging devices then went to a barbecue joint in town. We devoured hush puppies and a nacho starter together then I had a salad, two sandwiches, fries and a free thru hiker pudding washed down with a beer before finishing and still feeling hungry. After Linner, yes Linner, we each resupplied quickly and I ordered a Piza Hut pizza. I got back to the hotel and hung my clothes to dry and ate more pizza and ice cream. The rest I planned to pack out for dinner along with a tall boy mango-rita. Those things are bomb!

I downloaded two books before leaving town and had one free one sent to me by Two Clicks who had recommended it. I'm in love.
Today started with, Of course, a 6:30 wake up. A few of us hit the Continental breakfast around 7:30 and I swear I had probably 4,000 calories. I showered again and hung around until Two Clicks could get stove fuel from the outfitter that didn't open until later. I hung out and watched his stuff and enjoyed the beautiful morning.
At 10 am I started my hike along with my audiobook. I began with ""The Stranger in the Woods"" which is about the North Pond Hermit, Christopher Knight, in upstate Maine. A really interesting story I've been itching to learn more about and would recommend to anyone else interested in the idea of solitude like this man had for 27 years.
The time passed quick through some semi-tough climbs and some rolling fields. Eventually Two Clicks and I hit the Blue Ridge Parkway which is a scenic drive through the area. The benefit of it for us was that it has trash cans! So those mango-ritas we packed out can be tossed tomorrow morning and we won't have to carry them! Yay for alcohol! Just kidding... This is the first drink I've ever packed out on trail and I just happened to get lucky.
Anyway... The book lasted roughly 6.5 hours and somehow we cranked out that mileage before 6.5 hours and I still had more to listen to!

I can't bring myself to complain about the heat YET but I'm sure you'll hear about it soon. We have had nothing but great days the past week or so. I learned that hours after we submitted Mcafee's Knob, there was a forest fire that shut down the AT section through there. Crazy! I'm outrunning forest fires!
During the night I awoke to footsteps outside the shelter. I got weary as they sounded close to our bear bags hanging from the tree and kept looking about the outside. Finally, under the bright full moon, I saw two deer grazing outside. Whew! I was ready to change my name to the bear brawler or something along those lines to save our food but deer are friendly!
The morning was colder than expected but felt good. Once getting out around 7 I took it slow in the morning to call home and enjoy the cooler temperatures. I got excited about being able to throw out the one day of trash I had which looking back at it is so pathetic. It's the little things.
Today required a crazy amount of climb. Over 5,000 ft in elevation gain over the course of the day and they were steep climbs. Luckily, most of it was switchbacks but some of the climb was straight up and a pain! This called for my newfound love of audiobooks. Lord of the rings is next up and from 10am on I listened to The Hobbit! I like to start music or books after the quiet morning when the birds are singing and the air is cool. Otherwise I feel bad about missing it!
At lunch, Two Clicks and I had met up and ate while having our typical midday coffee date. Instant coffee at midday has given me a huge boost recently and I think Two Clicks and I look forward to it even on hot days. Weird thing was that in the shelter journal, a guy named Low Gear had signed in before climbing up the mountains. Two Clicks and I looked at each other with nervous smiles. The creepy man we had met a week back was named Low Gear!
I began the hikes and eventually reached the top where there is an FAA air navigation tower of some sort that makes me think of Epcot! It's a giant white golf ball on the mountaintop! Shortly after I ran into the mysterious Low Gear. Luckily it wasn't the man we had thought and it seems Low Gear may be a common name.

After the morning hiker shuffle and packing of the bags I made off for the day. The trilliums were blooming and the vegetation on both sides of the trail were popping with life. What a morning!
I continued on and eventually listened to The Hobbit again. The miles went quick and the uphills were quick and easy especially compared to yesterday! Eventually Bags, Calves, Two Clicks and I were all leap frogging. We all made it over Highcock Knob.... What the heck Virginia... And eventually to the James River.
At the James River, I ran into some day hikers coming south. I said my Hello's and moved off the trail for them. One was an older guy and one was in his 50's or so. The older gentleman asked if I was ""a real hiker or a fake one."" I answered strangely saying ""well I'm thru hiking and almost halfway done so I guess you could say I'm a real hiker."" At that he said ""well you tell me if you feel halfway in another 100 miles at Harper's Ferry."" I began saying ""I imagine I will"" before he cut in and said ""you won't!"" He mentioned he had section hiked the entire trail and seemed to look down on me. Not sure what my simple greeting did to piss him off bit I just walked off without dealing with his narcissism.
Shortly after I crossed the James River over the longest foot bridge on the AT. Luckily, Calves- who was finishing his long section of the AT- was being picked up by his sister. Two Clicks, Bags, Calves and I packed into the small Nissan and braced for the curvy road to Glasgow, VA. We made it there and said thank you to Calves' sister before departing. We walked over to the free shelter in town. The town of Glasgow has built and maintained a shelter in town for thru hikers. What a great idea. There is a pizza restaurant right behind the shelter and all of us staying there ate there as well as resupplied at the grocery store across the street. Well done Glasgow!
Two Clicks and I walked over a mile to a restaurant that ended up being closed so we walked back to the pizza place and ate as much as we could. We then resupplied and grabbed beer. At the shelter we met a bunch of cool hikers and even used the free outdoor shower at the shelter. We hungout and enjoyed the amazing amenities here. They even have outlets and a microwave! I'll be hitting Waynesboro, VA in 4 days, the Shenandoahs in 5 then Harper's Ferry shortly after! Ill be meeting up with my sister, Ann, soon then I'll be picked up for graduation on May 18th. Really pumped especially with the nicer weather!","Thunder Hill Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589214,"The lovely town of Glasgow treated Two Clicks and I very well including this morning. I should mention that the town also has a fiberglass dinosaur in the middle of town next to the grocery store. When we asked about it, they just said some guy came and built it and since then it has simply stayed. Strange, but cool!
At about 645 in the morning, Two Clicks and I walked across the street to the gas station, bags on our back. The temperature was expected to be in the 90's today and we wanted some early breakfast before climbing. Most of the time, the AT is not glamorous. I haven't washed my clothes in about a week and a half, I basically drive my body to it's limits and I often find myself loitering outside gas stations. This was no exception. We walked in and poured some pretty awesome coffee, although I wouldn't have said otherwise in my condition and we each grabbed two Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches in the fridge. Now I encourage you all to read Hungry Cat's journal if you get the chance because he had a totally different experience in Glasgow. We paid our bill and put the sandwiches in the microwave for a minute each before sitting on the curb outside people watching and eating like animals as normal.
When the time came, we positioned ourselves in what we concluded was a good place to hitch. Near an intersection, on a busy road and with enough room for a car to pull off. Well, luckily none of that mattered. As soon as a car approached, we stuck our thumbs out. Without hesitation, this guy stopped in the middle of the road with traffic behind him and pointed to the bed of his truck. We both ran up, jumped in and before we were even settled he was off without a word to us. The backpacks and our looks seem to give away our desired destination. The 6 mile ride in the back of the pickup was awesome and we said our thanks as he pulled into the trail lot near the James River. That was easy!
The day began with 3,000 feet of elevation gain. I don't want to sound cocky but I crushed it and felt amazing. It was nice to beat the heat. From there I hiked down a bunch to a lake then followed a creek for the rest of the day. I only saw one person. It was a kid who had just finished his last final of college and was gleaming with joy. I definitely know that feeling. I told him he should go hike the AT now but that didn't seem to interest him at all. Hahaha I tried. The days hike seemed quick and by 3:00 I had hiked 20 miles! Two Clicks was right behind me and from there we walked our sweaty bodies over to the creek and layed in the water. It was cold but extremely refreshing. I considered hiking on up another 2400' of elevation to the top of Bald Knob (which apparently isn't even bald? Virginia...) But the heat and lack of further motivation held Two Clicks and I at the shelter where we hung around.
At 6:30, after dinner, Two Clicks and I had a second wind. Another hiker, Bags, was pushing on up the hill and headed for the next shelter. I said to Two Clicks ""we should push on"" and instantly he agreed. We were feverishly grabbing gear and repacking everything with plans to hike 4.6 miles up to the top of Big Bald that isn't actually a bald. I cranked out the miles as quick as I could just to enjoy the cool air up top and the lack of bugs. By 8 I had made it up and scoped out a spot for tents. I set up in the last bit of light as Two Clicks rolled up with Bags behind him. We all made camp and then layed down to enjoy the cooler air and wind that was blowing. It was going to be a much more comfortable night!
P.S: Hi Mrs Young's! Glad you're following my journal! Two Clicks has been an awesome companion to hike with and we've definitely seen some cool things together! Crazy to think we've hiked almost 400 miles together.","Glasgow, VA

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589215,"The wind had died down this morning and getting up was comfortable. We were happy to have pushed up the mountain last night which left some ridge walking to The Priest then a long down hill.
We all started off at our own paces and after an hour or so I plugged in my headphones and finished The Hobbit. I was not feeling it this morning. It was a struggle and I think it was partly due to the push last night. The ridge walks are easy in retrospect but still require ups and downs that drained me. Two Clicks and I stopped at the same shelter for lunch and he was feeling the same way. We both ate and drank as much as we could spare then drank double doses of coffee in hopes caffeine would help.
I'll say, lunch had a huge effect on me! The break and food pushed me a lot and we both cranked out the next climbs. At The Priest Mountain shelter, there is a tradition of thru-hikers writing their confessions in the shelter log. I sat there for 10 minutes or so reading them before writing my own. They were hilarious! Green Grass had written ""hike on sinners!"" And it seemed a few hikers took that quote and rolled with it! Even the privy here seemed like a confessional!
The hike up the priest was decent but had no real views. I hiked down hill about 4 miles then back up another 2.5 to the shelter I had planned to stay at. I scored again and there was a creek right in front. I jumped in and enjoyed the freezing creek water after 25 miles in 90 degree weather. So did Two Clicks and a nice flip flopper we met. The rest of the night I hungout waiting for the rain forecasted tomorrow and looking forward to cooler temperatures. Of course I can't complain about the heat.","Stealth Camp on Big Bald
",Harper's Creek Shelter,"May 04, Fri",25.40
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589285,"With no rain, yet, I was up and out of the shelter by 6:30. Fairly early for me. I had a 2000' climb over 3 miles this morning and I was poised to get up and over it before the rain and potential thunderstorms started. The climb reminded me a lot of the police boot camp I did back in the day. Being woken up out of a deep sleep and pushed to your limits is not extremely fun but I had signed up for both.
Once up, I was to essentially walk a ridge with small climbs of 300' or less. The trail paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway at some points and again I had the opportunity to throw out my trash! Two Clicks and I had met up by now and had our coffee and lunch earlier than usual. The rain had held off for the most part and we wanted our caffeine fix before the skies opened up as we had expected.
We ran into a group of trail maintainers working on cutting some blowdowns. Thanks to the Tidewater Appalachian Trail Crew for your hard work and for the orange you so nicely gave me!
We began hitting more popular hiking destinations and you could tell it was Saturday. Day hikers swarmed Humpback Mountain as we were descending it's peak. I met a few awesome hikers who asked ""you going all the way to Maine?"" I answered with my usual remark ""I'm trying!"" While attempting to be humble. They yelled ""you're not trying, you're doing!"" And at this point with the miles I had hiked I realized they were right! Other day hikers seemingly unaware of what the AT was simply gave me weird looks. I can understand why though. I really do think I smell beyond typical BO. It's sweat, foot stench and a terrible diet mixed in with hot, humid weather to make a nice ripe smell. The only thing that had helped me were the creeks I had jumped in the last two days.
Upon meeting up with Two Clicks and Bags along the trail we all decided to push the 27 miles to Waynesboro. We originally were going to stay at the shelter then do a nearo in on Sunday but man, food is a huge motivator. Thru hikers including myself unintentionally starve themselves in the woods then end up eating so much in town. It's hard to get used to! With that, we were on a mission. Even a hiker further down trail said ""that's the pace of All You Can Eat I hear!"" He was right, we had our sights on Ming's AYCE Chinese Buffet based on recommendations from a few hikers we'd seen.
In our race for fried Chinese food, we ran across a hiker stopped in the trail. The notorious sound of a rattle was behind him and as we approached he said ""you guys want to see a rattler?"" I'm thankful he had stopped to warn us as the snake was right off the trail! We cautiously and nervously passed by without incident but it was a cool encounter!
On arrival at Rockfish Gap, we were surprised to a popcorn food truck where the Blue Ridge Parkway ends and the Skyline Drive begins! I gave a call to the hostel we planned on staying at, Stanimals, and he sent a driver to pick us up for free! Stanimals sounds like that kids snack but it's a really cool place and offers a ton!
We settled in and made our way to the Buffet. I put myself in a coma and regretted it after but I was able to sit in the living room with everyone else and watch Borat while relaxing and digesting. It was a good night with freshly washed clothes and I planned my first zero in 400 miles for tomorrow.
P.S thank you to all who are reading this. It's really cool to see your guest book entries and sometimes to run into people who know me based on my journal! I try to put in some decent effort into telling of the realities of the trail for both your entertainment, because it is hilarious I think, and for the sake of my memory when I finish hiking. I'd love to hear from more of you so feel free to comment! Thanks Connie for following and your nice words on my journal!","Harper's Creek Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589353,"The smell of coffee and the bustle of the hostel woke me up as normal...at 6am. I worked my way downstairs and started a new pot of coffee to sip on. Some hikers were leaving early while Two Clicks, Bags, Legs, Speedy and I agreed on going to Weasie's diner for breakfast. I ate wonderfully having an omelette with toast and home fries and a side of french toast washed down with coffee and it was amazing.

On the way home I stopped at Walmart and resupplied on food. I honestly just wing it now and resupply for 4-5 days to get into another town. It's worked out so far! Plus I'll be hitting the Shenandoah National Park which has wayside restaurants not far off trail where I can cheat and eat well for once.

I got back and managed to score a ride with a trail angel in town named Dave. In Waynesboro there is a community of trail angels that are willing to help hikers out a ton! Dave picked me up and drove me to the outfitters a ways away from downtown and wouldn't take a penny for the ride. Thanks Dave! I struck out on new insoles and new shoes there but was able to get permethrin spray for my clothes to battle the ticks that have come out! The shoes and insoles will have to wait until Front Royal, VA and Harper's Ferry respectively.

The remainder of the day I milled about the hostel in loaner clothes as my hiking clothes dried of the spray. I watched a ton of movies, ate food and drank Rockdale Lights in honor of my Westfield roommates. Rockdale seems to only be sold at Walmart for wicked cheap and that was the go to high class drink for us. So cheers to Nick and Tom who I'll be walking across the graduation stage with in about two weeks!

Towards the end of the night I walked by myself a few doors down to get ice cream. I sat on a bench facing the street licking a chocolate cone of ice cream watching the traffic go by reflecting on my trip so far and what was to come. I'm so grateful for all I have experienced so far and I'm so excited for the journey ahead! Something about watching society go by in solitude knowing tomorrow I would be back out on trail, in the woods which seem more natural now, was relaxing and a great way to end my day off. 

P.s: Hi Brad! Thanks for following my journal. I have fond memories of living across the street from Sally! Glad to hear you're working on the 48s! Love those peaks and can't wait to get back there! Happy Trails!","

Therefore, I had to set my alarm. 5:30 I got up and started the coffee and began cooking. I made 6 bacon, egg and cheeses. 2 for myself with 4 left to feed two clicks, speedy, legs and another hiker from NH named Trade Mark. They all got up by 630 and were eating and packing quickly before Stanimal drove Speedy, Two Clicks and I to the trailhead. We were off!
We hiked up the trail and officially entered the Shenandoahs by filling out a permit and attaching half to our pack. No charge... Smokies. The terrain was amazing all day and I hovered around 3000' all day. The trail criss crosses Skyline Drive continuously so I passed roads, parking lots and a bunch of day hikers. One hiker grilled me on whether or not I was actually thru hiking. He claimed I was too clean and I wanted to say ""we're not always dirty animals"" but I kept my wits and passed on. Even after he claimed my gear was too clean. Want to lick the salty sweat off my bag? Or maybe enjoy the smell of my shoes or sleeping bag? Too agressive but that's what I wanted to say.
At one point I had the opportunity to call Oboz shoes. I need a new pair as my current ones have almost hit 500 miles. Unfortunately they have discontinued the current style I wear but as a thru hiker, they offer me two replacements on my shoes for free! They're sending me a new pair that my parents will bring when I go to graduation. What an awesome company and such great customer service. I've had tremendous luck with my Oboz trail runners and recommend them to anyone! Thanks Oboz!
By 3 I had hiked to the shelter I had originally planned on staying at and was feeling great. I planned on moving on to stealth camp but the camaraderie and the people here were great so I stopped and enjoyed the afternoon in the nice weather in preparation for tomorrow meeting my sister and enjoying some good food!","Waynesboro, VA

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589689,"Oh my gosh. Worst night on the trail yet. We had an older gentleman section hiking the trail that had massive bowel movements all night. Not the type of thing I would normally talk about but it was insane. Not only that, he needed to pee every half hour all night. Every time, he seemed to wake up the whole shelter. Added to this was someone snoring so loud all night then a whippoorwill bird as an alarm clock this morning. This bird is literally an alarm clock and decided to call early in the morning. Man it was miserable. As soon as the sun came up, roughly 5:50, I woke up and got out of there. I was happy to be gone.
The hike was amazingly beautiful this morning. I listened to the birds, saw some bunnies and ran into a deer walking south down the trail. It revitalized me after my sleepless night. 8 miles in, I stopped at a campground store right off the trail. They sold typical camping gear along with food for hikers! I got a coffee and breakfast sandwich while charging my phone, enjoying the morning and talking with Two Clicks about the night. Eventually, we pushed on another 2 miles and went off trail again to a wayside diner off skyline drive. I got a full breakfast and coffee there along with the infamous blackberry milkshake everyone says you need to get in the Shenandoahs. Two clicks, trademark and I spent 45 minutes here before moving forward again!
4 miles from the wayside, we reached Pinefield Gap where I was to meet Ann. Two Clicks, Speedy, Remy, Trademark, Legs and I all waited here off the side of the road for my sister to arrive. She pulled in around 1:10 and I greeted her then we were treated to fruit, candy and most importantly pumpkin bread and cookies made by my mom. It was amazing! Most of the food was eaten but the remainder we walked south to the shelter 0.5 miles back to treat anyone staying there to trail magic. Ann then drove 4 of us to the wayside and I had another meal there while some of them got their first. We ate a lot and were thankful for the amazing food. Thanks Ann and mom!
Around 3, Ann departed as the rest of us headed up the trail to hike 8 more miles to the shelter for the night. It was a tough 8 miles with the food but we made it by 530. I vowed to tent tonight to finally sleep well and avoid the misery of last night in case it happened again.","Black Rock Hut

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589690,"Waking up in my tent was beautiful this morning. I slept amazingly and was happy I had made that choice. I packed up and ate then made my way up the trail. As most days have been, the birds were chirping and the weather was beautiful. I love getting up early these days to beat the crowds and enjoy the woods at what I would argue is their finest.
The ""big"" climbs were in the morning and by the time we hit the first campground we had finished the majority of the climbs. Two clicks and I had met up and had some lunch at the campground store. We may not love the fact that society is so close all the time but these waysides and stores with food are amazing. I've only cut down my food bag weight a little bit but I don't regret taking advantage of the food! We had coffee (what seems to be our daily coffee date-- upgraded to iced Starbucks coffee while in the national park) and sandwiches as we watched the commotion of the campers from the safety of our benches while our phones charged. After hiking out, Two Clicks and I chatted. Being in that store was wicked stressful and I think mainly because we aren't in society on a regular basis. As we climbed a mountain and looked around, we were again reminded of the simplicity of our current status of living and simply watching the bees land on flowers while the sun rays beamed down on us restored us back to our serenity.
Soon after, I took a blue-blazed trail to a rock scramble for a decent view and overlook. It was a really nice decision and I'm glad I did it but i regretted it after catching back up to Two Clicks. Shortly after he had bypassed the scramble, he saw two bear cubs and a mama bear. Pretty cool! The Shenandoah National Park is well known for it's bears, even moreso than the Smokey's so I am determined to see one.
Further along the trail we blue blazed to Skyline Drive for another wayside. More food! I got a burger, soda and a banana. I wolfed down my food as I charged my phone more and again watched the tourists. It's pretty amusing watching them and I'm sure they feel the same about us. After calling home and using the restroom I had four more miles to camp. It was only 3!
I pushed hard continuously looking for bears. I saw a turkey and some deer but no bears. I should be happy with that though! They were pretty cool! Passing Big Meadows Campground we had all heard of trail magic at site D143 or something like that. I wandered in aimlessly looking for something that resembled trail magic. I had no luck but I was full anyway and hiked the last two miles to camp.
Tonight I set up in the shelter. I ate only ramen with a bunch of appetizers (fruity snacks, dried pineapple, kit Kats-- you know) then had my dessert of a honey bun and Hershey bar mainly in hopes of lessening the weight of my bag. Tomorrow I'm pushing hard and hoping to get 28 miles to a shelter with a dinner time stop at another wayside before saying bye to Two Clicks. He's getting off tomorrow and I'll be pushing on then getting off next week. Not sure we'll see each other again but we both agreed our midday coffee will continue! Time for early bed and listening to Lord of the Rings!

P.S: Hi Jacqui! Thanks so much for following! I'd say the prayers are working as I've outrun a wildfire unknowingly and been blessed this entire trip! You're right, day to day this experience is one crazy adventure but I'm happy to be doing it and can't wait to be able to look back and reference the lessons I learned out here for the rest of my life!

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589963,"In the morning I woke up at 6 with Two Clicks and we both got ready. Today was the last day we were going to be together and we ended up hiking the morning together. At a spring only a mile or two in, I bent down to grab water. As I did, Two Clicks turned around and spotted a black bear cub. I turned around in haste and watched this cub walk away about 150 yards away from us. There was one more cub and a momma bear with him and they were just minding their own business roaming the hillside. We did our best to take videos but they were terrible and we didn't want to be like the classic tourist that chases the bear so we moved on.
Eventually we hiked on our own for the day meeting back up for lunch 15 miles in. It was warm and humid today and a flash storm had rolled in around 10, enough for a shower! At lunch, I had left a sign of sticks saying ""HB"" with an arrow pointing to the shelter off trail. Luckily, Two Clicks saw it and we had our final coffee ""date"" at the picnic table over lunch. The rest of the day we pushed 13 miles to a wayside. On the way, I spotted another cub and was pumped but worried because I never did see the mom. Again, I got terrible videos of the bear.
At the wayside I rolled in around 2:45. I grabbed some chicken fingers and fries, a tall boy of yeungling and I resupplied for a few days of food. While charging my phone and hanging out, Two Clicks rolled in and hung around with me. He was waiting for his mom to pick him up. It's funny, in the time she took to fly from Boston and drive from Washington to the Shenandoahs we had hiked 22 miles... Society is crazy!
We chatted and had our beers around a table outside and when his Mom arrived, we snapped a picture together. Two Clicks and I had met around mile 450 and we had just hit 950. For 500 miles and most of Virginia we had hiked together. What a guy. Cheers Two Clicks and Happy Hiking! I'll be looking for you in the shelter logs after I get back from graduation.
As Two Clicks took off with his mom, I hiked another 5.7 or so to a shelter. Up and over a mountain I narrowly avoided another passing storm as I rolled in with seconds to spare before the skies opened up and lightning struck. I chatted with the two others here and they warned of a big bear in the area. Once the storm had ended and I finished dinner, I walked to fill my water and saw the bear. It was massive! Probably 300 pounds or more and just waddling around. I'm with a whole new group of hikers tonight except Speedy and Trademark who both pushed the miles today too! What a day over some of the ""harder"" terrain of the Shenandoahs. Time for bed and a short day tomorrow.","Rock Springs Hut

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589964,"Last night I had some more fun with a section hiker. Nothing against them but the two incidents lately have been funny. In the middle of the night after this guy went pee, he came back into the shelter. As he did, he began to crawl on to me. He had thought his sleeping pad was mine and literally sat on my legs before realizing that either someone was in his sleeping bag or that, in fact, he had mistaken his position. At the moment I was mad but looking back it was funny.
Without being able to sleep in even with Two Clicks gone I ended up waking around 6 with everyone else in the shelter. I hit the trail at 7 and made it to the gap to Front Royal by 11:30. Officialy out of the Shenandoahs! As I got there I was just preparing to hitch but out of nowhere, this man who runs Mountain Home Hostel walked over from his car and offered me a ride to town. He had been picking up trash on the side of the road. I am blanking on his name but I really appreciate it!
In town, he dropped me off at the outfitters. This begins my crazy awesome town experience. At the outfitter I stopped in quick and picked up my insoles I had put on hold a few days back. It was quick and painless! I felt like a new man with them in my shoes. The workers in the store even gave me a few free energy bars! Thanks Mountain Trails!
Next, I threw on my pack and walked down the street. There was a town meeting going on at the downtown pavilion that I would later learn was a building safety meeting. As I walked behind the pavilion in view of those listening to the presentation, the entire crowd stared at me. Either this guy was real boring or I was just a sight to see. Probably a bit of both for sure haha. As I avoided these awkward stares, I flanked the presentation to find some vendors behind offering free food. Here's where I become official hiker trash. I was able to get a free ice cream and hot dog from the town of Front Royal's building safety meeting. Hahahahah! I find this hilarious even as I write it. Thanks Front Royal!
Right next door I stopped in the visitors center to ask about a good place to eat because I was still hungry! They recommended a place around the corner and gave me a hiker goody bag with chapstick, Band-Aids and a few other things. Score! Next, I made my way to the restaurant they recommended called Pave Mint. It was a restaurant in an old gas station and it was cool! I sat at the bar and drank and ordered a brisket sandwich. As I did, two thru hikers I had never met walked in. Their names were Bear Meat and Clooney. They had seen my pack and immediately said hi to me as we thru hiker trash do to each other. They were meeting the man at the bar next to me who had given them a ride earlier. He had told them to come by so he could pay for their meal and by me simply being in the same restaurant and also hiker trash, he paid for mine too! What a nice guy. He had a really unique name and unfortunately I don't remember that either. I've got to get better at that.
Anyway, he drove those two back to the trail while I ran across the street and grabbed an ice tea and a sandwich, which I packed out to the shelter tonight, from dunks. I called home then crossed the street to hitch out. I stood in a spot with a road beyond for cars to pull over. No bites. I stood longer as a few 20 year olds from town walked over and sat at a picnic table near me. I asked what the chances were I got a ride and they said, ""slim."" As they said that, a guy named John in a pickup truck pulled off the side. I ran up and jumped in the bed as he asked. As we drove away the 20 year old stared in awe with smiles as I waved goodbye to them.
At the trail I climbed 5 miles to the first shelter. The Mollie Denton Shelter. This one was amazing and had a porch, a deck, horseshoes to play and a makeshift shower! I sprayed my head with the water as I cooled off from the hot sun and chatted with Trademark. He was staying here but I was going to push on. I pushed another 5.5 miles to a shelter and tented for the night here meeting Speedy and chatting with a few flip floppers before bed. What an amazing day! Thanks Front Royal!

P.S: Hi David! Glad you're still following. I sure do smell worse than Ann, I think she can vouch for that! Mary- I'll do my best to post pictures of those things you asked as soon as I get decent wifi. Mrs Croteau- yeah I'm glad I sprayed the permethrin too!

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590330,"The climbs and descents at the beginning of today were really easy and by 11:30 I had made it 9 miles and barely broke a sweat avoiding the hot weather forecasted for later on. You could tell it was going to get hotter for sure.
I ate lunch at a shelter right at the southern end of the roller coaster as it's known. It's 13.5 miles of constant ups and downs all between 300-600 feet or so. I made it a point to get my caffeine fix and a good meal in me before attempting it. Someone have even left a small bin of Gatorades at one of the trailheads so I was able to get some electrolytes in me before the heat and climbs too.
I started up the climb having been hiking completely alone all day. I ran into two thru hikers then started running into a bunch of day hikers. It was Saturday of course! Most of the time day hikers are pretty cool. Hell, I was a day hiker the majority of the past few years. Today though, a lot of them seemed to be oblivious to the fact that they were on the AT and very few of them even said ""hi"" back to me when I pulled off the side and greeted them which I try to do all the time if I can. There was one older couple, however, that greeted me with a big smile and said ""you'll make it all the way"" in a gentle tone. Thanks to this older couple, you rock!
I passed a 4 foot black snake on one of the climbs and supposedly it wasn't venomous at all but it still freaked me out. I can deal with a lot but snakes aren't my strong point.
I continued going up and down on the afternoon ride on the coaster. No big issues except I was sweating wicked bad. I was drenched. I came to a gap where all the day hikers had parked and had a gentleman give me another Gatorade! He was helping a friend he knew that was thru hiking and we chatted for a few minutes. I guzzled two Gatorades then went up trail immediately regretting it. Luckily, I stopped to talk to a Patomac Appalachian Trail Maintainer and that gave me time to digest a bit.
Further along I passed the 1000 mile marker! Again, just a bunch of rocks and sticks in the shape of 1000 but I yelled with happiness at the sight of it. Of course it was past the day hikers peak destination so I didn't have anyone to join in the excitement but it was still awesome!
More ups and downs brought me to Bear's Den rock outcropping where more people had done a leisurely mile hike up for the views. I asked someone to take my picture and they were happy to. When I asked someone where a side trail went, they said ""well you're on the Appalachian Trail."" I replied as kindly as I could muster ""I know, but where does this trail go?"" I think it took him a minute to put two and two together. My stench, a big backpack and coming from a different direction than everyone else gave it away eventually.
I decided not to stay at Bear's Den Hostel only 0.1 off trail and instead pushed on. At a gap 0.6 from the top, I walk 0.3 miles down a road to where Speedy had said there was a restaurant. There was indeed! I had a great rest at the Horseshoe Curve Restaurant as I sat at the bar by myself with just the bartender at 4pm drinking a cold Bud light after all that heat. Unfortunately, the deep fryer wasn't working, so I had to order a salad with my burger instead of fries and mozzarella sticks. What a shame for me but it went a long way in helping me eat healthier. I could feel it after leaving! Upon leaving, Speedy was coming down the road and was planning to eat then meet me at a campsite. The veggies drove me 3 more miles to a peak just over the border into West Virginia. I was so pumped to have hit 1000 miles and cross into West Virginia even though I would cross back into Virginia once or twice more only for a few miles each time.
I camped at a semi-established tentsite near the peak protected by some trees and part of the mountainside. I was happy for this because I had heard there was a big storm coming through tonight and I was hoping that this spot would keep me dry enough. After pitching my tent and taking care of chores I laid around as the winds picked up. The breeze felt amazing and reminded me of some Florida storms that would come through as we use to visit my grandmother. ","Manassas Gap Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590349,"Last night was cool! It began raining around 10pm but stopped shortly after. Around 4am it began again and this time the heavens opened up and it dumped water on us! I laid there listening to the rain and was so thankful all my gear stayed dry. I watched the woods light up each time lightning struck and it was really peaceful. I only had some wet gear early in the morning once the mist settled and dampened everything around me.
At a break in the rain around 6 I began packing up my gear along with the wet tent. By 7 I hit the trail and began singing to myself as the sun began to shine through the clouds. Country roads played and felt so right as I hiked through WV closing in on the Shenandoah river. Eventually though, it began raining again for at least an hour and I got drenched in the thunderstorm.
As I neared Harper's ferry I got really excited. I took a picture at Jefferson rocks then took in as much of the history as I could as the trail entered town. At High Street, I walked 0.6 off trail right to the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters) to take my picture and officially register. I wanted to look as dirty and gross as I felt and I think I accomplished that! Number 181 to cross this point! 
I milled about and bought a few postcards and a buff before speaking with a few interested tourists about the AT. One family had a little boy who was so excited to hear I had seen bears and wanted to do the AT himself someday. Go for it man! They even bought me two snicker bars as they left! Thanks! I finished those right away! Another couple named Reuben and April asked me a bunch about the hike and the culture of the trail. They were awesome folks and gave me some money for my trip even after I refused. Thanks Reuben and April. Hope you found my journal!
Afterwards I began the search for a home for the night. As I walked towards a hostel, Speedy drove up in a van with a hostel worker. He was headed to Walmart for a resupply so I jumped in. Perfect timing! Afterwards, we got back and I finally showered-- sorry to the town of Harper's Ferry for having to smell me, then started laundry.
Around 4 I went to a bar as Speedy ate at the hostel. I got some chicken ziti and a salad and some congratulatory Bud Light. I grabbed some ice cream on the way back then hung out at the hostel eating my footlong steak and cheese sub from Subway I had gotten while at Walmart. Moving on into Maryland tomorrow and so excited for the next few days. Happy Mother's day to all the mothers reading this and especially to my mom who has done so much to help me get to where I am. I'm pumped I'll be seeing them this week! Love you Mom!
P.S: Hi Mrs. Young's! Don't feel bad about Two Clicks and I getting split up! It was going to happen eventually especially when I get off for 4 days or so! I hope we get the chance to meet up again! I texted him today, so pumped for him to hit the 1000 mark and get into Harper's Ferry! Hope you guys had a good visit!","Campsite mile 1007.8

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590458,"Speedy and I were the only ones in the hostel last night. Although it wasn't my favorite place, we both reported sleeping really well. It was a nice cool basement, the kind of temperature I think we're more used to sleeping in.
At 6 I started the coffee as Speedy jumped in the shower. I had paid a few extra bucks for breakfast and the woman who runs the Town's Inn cooked me eggs, bacon and toast to wolf down. Eventually I made it out around 7:30. The day started out with 4 miles of walking along a bike path. Completely flat! After that, there was a 1000' climb. I was pretty ready to hike so the climb felt good and I was back at it! The miles passed and eventually I started feeling pains on my toes. What's happened is my feet have swollen up including my toes. They keep rubbing together and causing hot spots and blisters are beginning to form. I imagine it also has something to do with my shoes being worn almost 600 miles so I'll be happy to switch shoes on Thursday. As for the toes, I'm making do with tape and trying to R.I.C.E them again. Hopefully 5 days of non-hiking will help too but I'm considering buying sock liners too.
I passed a good amount of section hikers today but only one other thru hiker. The trail through Maryland runs through Civil War historical lands and through the day I learned some interesting things and passed the Washington monument too! My original plan was to either stay in the shelter at Pine Knob or push on and tent on top of the Annapolis Rocks at a campsite. With the sky darkening and the sound of thunder in the distance, I cut the day short and ended at the shelter 23 miles in. I really wanted to push further but boy am I glad I stayed. The storm was rough with rain and lightning and warnings of hail from the National Weather Service. I had a spot under the roof with a few others but no sign of Speedy. According to other hikers it seems as though he may have pushed on to tent. Regardless, I'm dry and warm in the shelter and still on track to meet my parents on Thursday at Pine Grove Furnace State Park where I plan on trying my luck at the half gallon challenge! Wooo!","
",Pine Knob Shelter,"May 14, Mon",22.90
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590812,"Early this morning the rain came again. Lightning and buckets of rain came down as I lay comfortable in the shelter. Until, I realized there was a leak in the roof and I was underneath it. I moved over a few feet and was fine! No big issues, just pretty funny.
I got out early and beat some of the heat. I had great views at Annapolis rocks of the post and pre storm that was forecasted to start again around 2. The miles passed and I saw a few bunnies, deer and squirrel. The squirrels and Chipmunks always freak out as I hiked by and wait until the last second to run off freaked out. I saw a deer jump probably 10 feet across the trail without making a sound. It was super cool!
I eventually caught up to Speedy who had camped at Annapolis rocks last night. He had gotten some cool photos after the storm last night and said it was intense. We hiked together for a bit before leaf frogging each other. Rocks are getting more prevalent as we near rocksylvania!
I passed beautiful streams and some cliffs making me think of the Lord of the Rings that I've been listening to before bed most nights. The weather was around 80 degrees and apparently 75% humidity. I was sweating so much but I carry more water than most and seem to guzzle through that too. Between the sweat and water weight I think I have a chance at gaining weight haha!
At 1230 I took a lunch break at Penmar State Park right on the PA/MD border. I was surrounded by two groups of Buddhist groups of some sort. Each group had two monks with robes and the rest of the group consisted of average people who I believe were on some sort of retreat. It was definitely interesting crossing the Mason/Dixon line from Baptist Churches to Buddhist monks walking barefoot down the trail but they were very kind!
Crossing into PA felt really good! I hiked another 9 miles or so across really easy terrain to the shelter. As I rolled in, a man sitting there commented on my weight, yes I know. Then he asked, ""beer or soda?"" I said beer and he kindly grabbed a cold beer from his cooler. He was a local who had hiked a mile from the road and was camping out. Lucky for me, he had packed out beer and that was amazing after a 25 mile day in the heat! I met a few northbound flipfloppers who had started in Harper's Ferry and other section hikers. They were all wicked nice. The shelter was amazing complete with a picnic table pavilion, privy with air fresheners and TP provided and tons of space! The maintainer even stopped by and gave me a soda! What a great night!
I soaked my feet and took a hobo bath in the creek then ate a ton. Cheese it's, two brownies, Hershey bar, peanut butter crackers, a mountain house and finished off some of my lunch foods. I chatted with the flip floppers all asking about my experience trying to learn from my mistakes. It was an amazing night!

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590814,"Speedy and I were the only ones in the shelter labeled ""non-snoring"" while two women slept in the ""snoring"" shelter. It was a relaxing night and I slept really well! In the morning, I woke to Speedy packing up and pushed myself to get up. I knew I had a shorter than normal day over lighter terrain so I felt no rush. Somehow though, I made it out before him and was on the trail by 6:45. So much for sleeping in.
The morning started with a 1000' climb then gradual uphill and downhill for the remainder of the first 10 miles. At PA rt 30 I had heard there was a restaurant that was a must stop. The place was called Timbers and as I neared the road, I ran into 3 flip flop hikers. 
First, let me explain what a flip flop is. It's when a person begins a thru hike somewhere other than Maine or Georgia and hikes one way. When they hit the end point-- Katahdin or Springer, they fly/drive back to their original starting point and hike the other direction to the other endpoint. The ATC is highly recommending this method now because it lessens the impact on the trail. I've met a bunch of flip floppers on trail since Harper's Ferry.
I met Bryan, One pole and I believe the women's name was Kara or Zara. Trail names havent been given to two of them because they just started. But, regardless, we walked to Timbers restaurant together and ate at the same table. They asked questions about my hike and I asked them what their favorite part had been so far. It was a good time. Speedy eventually rolled in as well and sat behind us. I had an omelette, home fries, English muffins, 4 massive pieces of French toast and a breakfast sandwich with cups and cups of coffee. I also ordered a bacon cheeseburger and packed that out for later! 
After two hours of sitting there and charging my devices I decided to finish off the other half of my hike. I said my goodbyes to the flip floppers and told them I would probably see them again after I got back on trail from graduation. I climbed another 1000' through Caledonia State Park then rode a ridge for a fair amount of the remaining 10 miles. I was having a really relaxing hike today and found myself stopping multiple times in some ""remote"" areas to just sit and enjoy the bird calls and beauty around me. It was an awesome afternoon.
The shelters in PA are amazing! They have outstanding privys, some have pavilions covering the picnic tables and clothes lines along with bear poles. Can't beat them! I stopped at my destination for the day around 3:30 and hungout talking to some hikers I had never met before. Tarzan was here and was nursing an injury to his foot and ankle. We shared stories of the trail and he asked about people he had known that I had seen in the prior days. I also met a flip flopper named Steve and enjoyed their company. I'm in a pretty desolate section of trail in terms of thru hikers. There are 5 or 6 about a day ahead and then a bunch behind but recently Speedy and I haven't seen many. It's weird getting to camp and being with flip floppers who are just starting the trail. They look to us for advice and watch us as we cook meals but I just try and reassure them that they'll do great. Taking a nice relaxing evening here before meeting my parents tomorrow for the half gallon challenge! Woo!
I want to congratulate all my friends at Westfield State and others I went to high school with on graduation! So pumped for everyone and excited to see what comes next for you all!","Tumbling Run Shelter
",Birch Run Shelter,"May 16, Wed",19.60
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590881,"Last night that cheeseburger didn't sit well. I woke up pretty dehydrated and weak. I'm never packing out a burger again! When I woke up, I realized I had slept in! It was 6:40 and normally I'm up by 6. No big deal though. It's seems the others around me were in no rush either.
By 7:30 I was on the trail while there was a break in the rain. That break didn't last long and by 8 it was raining again. The trails were like rivers and of course when I wear trail runners, there's zero way to keep them dry so I embraced the suck and kept on! Plus, I was getting picked up so I could dry out then!
A few miles in I passed the Dead Women's Hollow Road. A random dirt road in the middle of the woods. This had been the 2016 and 2017 official halfway point so I took a picture of the sign. For all intents and purposes I think I can settle on the fact that this is close enough to halfway as to not get too worked up on the EXACT point because there are so many ""halfway"" points. Harper's Ferry, the Half Gallon Challenge, a post erected by the hiking class of '95 and so on...
Further along I walked through forests that had undergone controlled burns. The forest service prescribes burns due to invasive species, to be proactive about actual forest fire possibilities and for a variety of different reasons. Regardless, walking through this section in the foggy rainy morning with little cover was interesting. It's amazing the huge variety of different landscapes we walk through on one given day. High mountain traverses, dense spruce forests, Meadows and farms, lowland marshes and even these prescribed burns. Sometimes all in one day!
About 7 miles in to my short 10 mile morning, I reached the sign that the class of 1995 had erected in the ground. It pointed to katahdin and to Springer with mileage of 1,090.5 in either direction. Again, it's probably not exactly halfway due to reroutes and things that happen to the trail but it was cool!
As I continued North, I passed a man slack packing South. He informed me that Pine Grove Furnace State Park had lost power in the storm the night before and that their ice cream had all melted. Hahahahah what are the odds. As I arrived to the camp store, I talked to the nice woman running the store named Michelle. She confirmed the story this man had told me but said an ""emergency ice cream delivery"" was coming. Hahaha I pictured a giant SWAT truck screeching to a hault near the store with lights going and Hershey ice cream filling the back straight from Hershey, PA. Apparently the state of PA mandates this state park has ice cream because of he popularity of the half gallon challenge. I wasn't one of the lucky few hikers to arrive yesterday and receive the ice cream from the freezer for free before it melted though. No ice cream was honestly for the best since I still wasn't feeling well from my burger last night. I WILL complete the Half Gallon Challenge at some point whether at the state park or not!
I planned on taking a free shower near the lake of the state park. I bought body wash and figured it was the least I could do for my mom and dad before they picked me up especially because mothers day just passed and their birthdays are coming up! I walked a ways away from the general store and tried out the showers. It was a cold rainy day and they were the kind you push the button and it runs for a second then shuts off. And, the water was cold. I couldn't push myself to do it! Sorry Mom and Dad!
I walked back to the general store and an older man began talking to me. He was really nice! It's funny- when people learn you are doing the AT they always follow up the conversation with their own experience either on the AT or backpacking/hiking. That's just human nature but it's really funny. As he was telling me his backpacking story, I saw my parents pull into the lot. Trying not to be rude, I said ""excuse me, my parents just got here and I haven't seen them in two months."" I ran over and gave them a nice smelly, wet hug and apologized again to the gentleman. He totally understood and was even from Adams, MA! Close to Westfield!
The kind people that my parents are, they had brought all sorts of food and drink. Apple Cider donuts from Applecrest!! The best! Tons of Hershey bars, Gatorade, fruit and a bunch more. It was amazing. We treated a woman from Utah to her first cider donut and she loved it. I told her to look forward to that as she hiked into New England.
With a lack of thru hikers there at the moment, we ended up leaving Gatorades and fruit on a bench with a sign noting trail magic. I know the hikers will like it! We then made our way over to the Appalachian Trail Museum right next door that had just opened for the day. It was a really cool place and the guy running it and I chatted about the trail in which he had thru hiked a few years back. Then I wandered around noting the old sign that sat on top of Katahdin, the Earl Shaeffer Shelter and a bunch of other exhibits before leaving.
As we departed, it felt strange. I was so happy to see my parents and to meet back up with Abby and all my friends but part of me felt completely different. Being dry, warm and fed while other hikers I had just been with were headed back out in the storm planning their stops and resupplies as I had done for the past two months. Not only that, putting on clean clothes, driving the car at 70mph and knowing I had five days to do the things I normally do in less than 24 hours was a huge contrast to my reality as Jacqui Kennedy had put it on my Facebook. It's not a bad feeling, just a strange one. I could literally feel my blood pressure rise as I was slowed down in the fast lane behind a slower moving car. I could feel my pulse rate rise as we tried to figure out what highway to connect to. I hadn't felt this way in 2 months. All I really had to worry about were simple necessities. Food, water and shelter along with weather. The nearest I had gotten to this rise was crossing a highway like in the game Frogger back in Virginia. I had no conscious thought about the drastic change in pace my life had taken until my 3mph world became a 70mph world in the fast lane of a highway only 20 minutes from the trail I relied on to take me from the South to the North. Guided only by white paint on trees and governed by the simplicity of the rise and fall of the sun.
We eventually arrived in Kingston, NY where we planned to stay for the night before driving to Westfield the next morning. At the Best Western, my parents paid for the room before we went in. I'm so grateful for them coming to get me and spending so much time and energy to plan for my graduation and this trip. I owe them a lot and credit them for me making it this far on the trail and in life. We walked in and I honestly prepared to roll out my mattress and sleeping bag on the ground. Nope, my parents are awesome and had gotten two beds, one all to myself. I unpacked, threw in laundry and showered. My new shoes had come from Oboz and I was excited to try them on. Totally free just for being a Thru Hiker! Any future NOBOs out there seriously consider Oboz for trail runners! I was having trouble parting with my old trail shoes. They had brought me 600 wonderful miles from Damascus, VA to PA and I loved them but they were cold, wet and broken down so I settled the next morning on taking off the laces and throwing them out. They smelt awful and I was thinking I could do something cool with the laces from my 4 pairs of shoes after I complete the trail. If anyone has suggestions, let me know!
The rest of the night I spread things out in the hotel room to dry like typical hiker trash. I watched Grey's Anatomy (Thursdays are for Grey's) with my mom while eating a NY pizza then sorted new and old gear. I'll be switching back to my original sleeping bag and out of my 3 degree bag that is definitely not needed in the 40-50 degree nights. I'm also getting rid of my fleece, hat and winter gloves and replacing some small items. I'll probably be shaving off a pound or so of weight which will be awesome!
P.S. I won't be posting daily again until next week but I'll be doing a graduation wrap up next Monday sometime. Sorry I haven't uploaded photos on this website. It seems it may no longer allow me to so anyone interested in pictures will have to follow me on Facebook or Instagram. 
Hi Mrs Devlin! Hoping to see you at graduation too! Just look for a smelly, messy bearded guy with trail runners on under his gown!! That's awesome that you know Pine Grove Furnace.

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591472,"Leaving trail for 5 days to attend graduation had been something I tossed around in my head until April. I came to the decision that I would surely regret not going even though I had already graduated. It also allowed me to see my parents and girlfriend for the first time in two months and that was huge. I was lucky enough to get picked up by my parents. We made it to Westfield on Friday where I got to see Abby after a five minute long hug in the parking lot. Then Saturday I walked across the stage with all the friends I had from college. It was a great weekend and to top it off, Abby and I roadtripped back to PA Sunday and had that night and Monday to be together for a little bit. I use the quote similar to that of Piglet from Whinnie The Pooh ""lucky I am to have something so hard to say goodbye to"" or something like that. Anyway, even though I'm further north, saying goodbye to Abby and my family wasn't easy. Especially when you walk down a path away from the comfort of the car and the sad look on your girlfriend's face as it begins to pour and you are about to hike another month without seeing her. I'm going to push though and finish this up. Big shout-out to my parents, Abby and my sister for helping me get to and from graduation and watching me walk. Love you guys!
Like I said, it rained all morning. Pretty much rained until the middle of the afternoon and I started around 10:30. It was a tough departure and start up but eventually I got closer to getting back in the swing of things and began getting used to my new shoes. The trails were rivers and as much as I tried to keep my feet dry, it was impossible. I trudged along.
I started seeing deer and bunnies as the rain simmered down. Around 15 miles in, I stopped at a shelter I had originally planned on staying at. It was full of section hikers and flip floppers so I altered course and figured I'd push a bit further with the sun poking out and it being only 3:30. Plus, I wasn't really in a social mood although they were all really nice. I grabbed water at the spring as there was no water at the campsite I planned to stay at then hopped back on trail for another 3.5 miles. No more rain was around so I got the mileage in quick and got to camp by 5. The trail cut through some cornfields so it was a cool change of pace.
At camp, I set up and dried out the best I could. Nobody else was here until a couple rolled in around 6:45. They set up camp further away and didn't seem social as they never came over to the picnic table I was at. I ate some Mt House meals my mom had given me and even tried the freeze dried ice cream sandwich! Space food! It was pretty good but not something I'd get often. Then, I hung around at camp taking my mind off things by listening to Lord of the Rings. Weather looks good tomorrow and terrain looks relatively flat. Hopefully I run into some familiar thru hikers and can hike around people I know. Until then, solitude! Except for the trains that keep passing loudly 20 feet from my tent.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

I was up at 6 ready to get back in routine. By 645 I was headed out into the Cumberland Valley. I had roughly 12 miles of flat hiking ahead through farm fields and passing over Interstate 81. The rain yesterday and the crazy rain last week managed to make this ""flat"" hike nothing easy. Pretty much the whole way there was a consistent coating of mud up to a few inches in spots. It made for an interesting morning. I ""played the game,"" as some hikers put it, for an hour. Rock hopping and dodging the mud gets old, tiring and it's slow so eventually I sucked it up and just walked right through most of it. I found myself singing that song I heard as a kid that goes ""mud, mud, I love mud. Im absolutely positively wild about mud..."" It makes it really difficult when every time you step off on your foot, it slides backwards making it exhausting. And with that, flat trails seem to hurt my feet more. My new shoes got broken in quickly with the mud but I'm still working on adjusting my feet to them.
The farm fields and meadows were a cool change of pace to the mountains but I could just tell they were tick central. I did my best to check every time I could and it worried me more not finding any.
Finally after 12 miles or so I climbed up the first ""mountain"" at the shelter near the top I stopped for a long lunch around 12. I had seen only three other hikers today. All section hikers going south. It's been very desolate. After lunch I checked out the privy named the ""Taj Mahal."" I'll be honest, I've seen better but it was still pretty nice, and big!
The last 7.3 miles were small ups and downs then a ridge walk of small rocks paralleling an oil pipeline before I reached the shelter. Here I saw a thru hiker named Ryan (he doesn't want a trail name) and then another named Swish that rolled in behind me. I hadn't met Swish before but Ryan I knew from the Shenandoahs. We chatted and I caught up on what had been going on recently then I iced my feet, did daily chores and hung out! Headed into Duncannon tomorrow morning for a tiny bit of resupply, to retrieve a pant leg that speedy and I had accidentally swapped and for some breakfast before pushing on past town. Speedy called me last week when I was off trail to let me know that he had my left and I had his left pant leg. We both have pants that zip off to shorts and they are the same color. When we had done laundry in Harper's Ferry, they must have been switched. I ended up mailing his correct one to Jersey where he lives and he will be in a week or so and he left mine at the front desk of the hotel in town for me to pick up so fingers crossed it's there!","Backpacker Campsite near Boiling Springs, PA
",Cove Mountain Shelter,"May 23, Wed",22
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591715,"Today started great. Up and out by 7 and I rolled into town around 8:30 which was actually earlier than I had expected. The only complaints consist of ""breaking trail"" in the sense that being the first one up means I get to walk through all the spider webs that cross the trail. Also the bugs were bad today and they love to dive bomb my eyes and ears which is insanely annoying! As I walked into Duncannon I stopped at the first gas station I saw to resupply. I just wanted to get that done with. I picked up most of my food and made my way to the woman at the register. As I strolled the three isles of the store she had been warmly greeting each person coming in with a smile. When I got up, she angrily stared at me and begrudgingly rang in my junk food. I had left my pack outside, been very considerate and I think my only fault was smelling bad but she did not want anything to do with me. She must have had a bad experience with a hiker but it seems like a bad business model for the gas station you hit in town literally on the trail.
Anyway, I moved on and next walked to the Doyle Hotel. Closed. Apparently they don't open until 11. I've never heard of that before but I needed to get my pant leg. I walked across the street to Goodies Breakfast joint and sat at the bar. The waiter confirmed nobody would be there until 11am then served me my breakfast and coffee. I sat with a flip flopper named Mr T, for having a bunch of tea bags, and considered my options. After Mr T left, Swoosh rolled in. He had stayed at the shelter that I tented at last night and sat next to me for food. I told him my dilemma and he noted he was getting off trail for 5 days like I had for a family reunion. He then offered to grab the pant leg at 11 and send it in the mail to my house. What a guy! I gave him some money for postage and my address then thanked him a bunch for his help before leaving.
On my way out of town, I stopped at a mini Mart for a few dinner meals I couldn't get at the gas station. As I looked for what I needed, the woman at the counter started yelling at some teenage kid leaving the store. I walked up front as he was exiting and I asked if he had skimped her on money. He had revved up his motorized bicycle (literally a bike with a motor attached) and began leaving when she said yes. He had only shorted her 50 cents so I told her to add that to my bill thinking I would build a rapport at this place for future hikers to go to instead of the Sunoco. The woman was very nice and I didn't think anything of it as I walked out.
The trail walked down a neighborhood street of Duncannon for roughly 2 or 3 miles and as I strolled along minding my business and saying hi to folks on walks,I hear a motor coming down the street. The teenage kid wizzes by me back toward the store and I give him a sort of evil stare haha. Only a few minutes later, he drives back from the direction of the store and up next to me. I stop and look at him and say ""you need to go pay your bill."" He complains that he didn't have the money and that he had found a quarter on the ground. I explain that that is not how this thing works and he ""bikes"" off angrily. Next thing I know, he's driving back towards me. He goes ""I'm not trying to start anything but I've worked hard for the good reputation I have in this neighborhood mowing everyone's lawns and being a good kid."" I responded saying I don't think he's a bad kid but that he needs to pay for what he buys. He ignorantly responds ""she didnt hear me say I was going to get the money and plus she doesn't speak English so she shouldn't be allowed in his country."" That really struck a nerve and I said, why are you not in school in which he noted he was homeschooled. I told him he needed to go back home and get schooled in acceptance of others and walked away. I was blown away that I just had an argument with some teenage kid over 50 cents in a town I was in for only an hour and that I had never heard of before. It was an interesting morning.
As I walked on the sidewalk connected to the interstate out of town, I passed what I first thought was road work. As I got closer, I noticed there was an over turned tractor trailer in the right lane and I was walking by it close enough to touch it. The tow crew was there working on removing it from the highway and the driver was standing a bit ahead with only a minor dressing on his left eye brow clearly already having been checked out by EMS. He said he was okay as I passed and I just thought of how weird this whole town trip had been.
I climbed up and out of town and rode a ridge for a good portion of the day with rocks in and out. I passed a guy named One Pole who I had eaten with at Timbers Restaurant before graduation. He informed me, like myself, that him and his friend Ryan both got sick after eating there and that confirmed my suspicion that I had food poisoning right before going to graduation.
I ran into a few other flip floppers I recognized including Wolfpack, Galaxy and song bird- all really nice people. After a late lunch I pushed another 9 miles to camp. I decided to stealth camp beside a spring 3/4 of the way up a climb to another ridge. It was a nice spot with water right there and I had it to myself to enjoy the night.
P.S: Since passing over the Mason Dixon line I've noticed that signs now say ""Maine to Georgia"" as opposed to signs in the south that said ""Georgia to Maine"" in regards to the AT. Interesting!
Thanks Mom! Trying to keep at it. I can't remember who sings Mud but I remember we all used to love him! I did find the sock liners and luckily haven't had to use them yet but will if my feet swell and toes begin rubbing!

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591811,"Last night a woman named Stonehenge from North Conway, NH rolled in around 8. She asked if she could stealth near my tent and of course I said yes, I have no control over stealth spots. We talked about up north for a bit before we both went to bed.
I woke up and got out of camp and it was a nice cool morning that would shape up to be a beautiful day. I finished the climb up to the ridge then hiked 10 miles to the other end. At the bottom of the other side I walked through an old mining settlement called Raush Gap. It was cool to hear the history and think of the 1000+ people that lived along the river at one time. From there I did a small up and down over a hill that had been prescribed to burn recently it seemed. Through some fields, another state park and under I-81 again- this time we crossed to the east side of it. I climbed to another ridge and there I hiked for the remainder of the day with the rocks picking up slightly. I only ran into a few people all day and otherwise it was quiet.
I pushed hard all day and got to the 501 shelter at 4:30. Word had been spread on trail that you could order pizza from there so I arrived and met up with two other thru hikers and two flip floppers and we all did one big order. I had a cheese pizza, a Gatorade and a root beer (no caffeine). I finished it all but one slice which I planned to eat for breakfast then hung around this awesome shelter. The caretaker, borderline, lives right next door. It's located right off RT 501 and he has a makeshift shower there and allows us to charge phones on his porch. I took a freezing cold shower that felt amazing. It was a nice end to a long push for today and tomorrow I hope to push 23 miles to Port Clinton, PA where I may tent in the town pavilion where they allow us to stay or may get a room depending on the weather.
P.S: I am officially 996 miles from Katahdin! Now I can start counting down from 1000. So pumped!","Stealth Campsite mile 1167.7
",501 Shelter,"May 25, Fri",27.10
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591938,"Around 6 the shelter began stirring and everyone was up by 6:15. I got up and out to begin the day into town. Word has it, the rocks begin after the 501 shelter so these miles would be tough. Sure enough, the rumors were fairly true and these miles were tough.
In the morning I met Fainting Goat who is a woman hiking the AT as her 3/3 triple crown. She was really cool and we chatted about hiking for an hour before she stopped to reserve a rental car in town and I continued on.
The miles passed by and as much as I don't want to say it, they were fairly unremarkable. Barely any views for the entire day and just ridge walking along rocks. It was tough and my knees and feet definitely felt it. I stopped 15 miles in around noon for lunch and just ate off the side of the trail instead of hiking 0.3 to the shelter and 0.3 back. 0.6 round trip is a lot for lunch so on trail it was! I was joined by 3 flip floppers. One named ambassador was carrying a 50+ pound pack and said she was going to do a shakedown in the next few weeks. I encouraged her to do it ASAP as her joints wouldn't hold up under that weight but I don't know if she will take my advice. 
I had contacted Two Clicks to let him know I was going to be hiking into the same town he was in. He had zeroed today to take care of a shin injury. He said I should join him in his hotel and just throw him a couple bucks! Better than tenting in town! When I got to town I figured I would just hitch in to Hamburg about 2 miles away. Low and behold, at lunch Two Clicks texted me and said he found me a ride. Two Clicks is relatively famous on Instagram and one of his followers lives in the area. This man makes money off his YouTube channel building and fixing cars! I gave him a call and we planned our meetup time and spot.
When I descended the 1000' in 0.7 miles which was rough on the knees, I was popped out in a rail yard. I walked a bit off trail to a pavilion for hikers in town where we could camp for free. At the pavilion, a guy named fresh ground who runs the Leap Frog Cafe was there! He caters to the hikers further north of the massive bubbles and just keeps jumping north as we hike all the way to Maine. He is famous for his trail magic! He had hot dogs ready for me then cooked me a few more and had Gatorade, watermelon, fruit and other snacks for me to devour. It was awesome and great to have while hiking. He could even tell I was a thru hiker right away from Georgia as opposed to the Flip Floppers and that made me feel good!
Once Two Clicks' follower showed up, I jumped in his falcon and he drove me to the hotel. On the way, we were stopped at a stop sign and I talked to thru hikers hanging out at a barber shop that's hiker friendly in town. They were amazed by the ride I had and Two Clicks' follower was able to show off his car as he peeled out. It was an amazing ride!
When we got to the hotel, the three of us hungout. They had never met before which is insane! The power of social media I suppose! Once he left, he vowed to drive us to trail tomorrow morning at 8:30. What an awesome guy. I'm completely blanking on his name but I'll find out again tomorrow! Two Clicks and I then made our way to the Cabellas across the street which is the largest in the country.it has a legit mountain in the middle with hundreds of taxidermied animals and an aquarium! I bought a tiny fuel canister then ran to Walmart to resupply food while Two Clicks went back to the hotel bar. When I got back, I joined him and ate dinner with a couple of beers and dessert. It's nice to have my appetite back after the food sickness from Timbers.
That night I finally showered (sorry Hamburg, PA-- I should have showered earlier) then hung out and caught up on tasks. What a great day! 75ish more miles in PA! Even with the rain and upcoming climbs, I'm so pumped. And I'm really excited to be back with Two Clicks and I think he's happy to have someone he knows around too! Goodnight!

P.S: Thanks Jacqui! It was great to reconnect but one of the hardest things to get back in the swing of hiking. I appreciate you saying that about the kid in Duncannon. It was a weird situation I had no idea would occur but I feel as though it may have at least caused him to think a bit more. I almost left it out of the journal in fear people may think I was too harsh on some teenage kid but hey, it's reality and for the most part I try to tell everything that happens as it is-- as appropriately as possible. I hope he learns too.","501 Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592060,"Two clicks and I woke up in the hotel room this morning and hiker hobbled our way to the breakfast they had. After wolfing down our food we packed up and hung around until 8:30 when his Instagram follower, Mr. Regular, picked us up. When he got there, we jumped in the car for the short ride to the trail then started up.
Of course the elevation we descended into town had to be made up on our way out so we had a big climb in the morning. Once on the ridge, the rocks kicked in again but we were both happy the rain held off all day.
We hiked together for a while until I hiked ahead while he sat down for some food. The rest of the day, we hiked the ridge, saw a few views and passed day hikers on the long weekend. We also had to be weary of rattle snakes as multiple people warned us of them. I didn't see any today but Two Clicks spotted one. At 2pm I hit a road near the Eckville Shelter where Fresh Ground and his Leap Frog Cafe were stationed. He cooked me a bunch of hot dogs and grilled cheese while I snacked and drank Gatorade and soda. I left his setup waddling. He is an awesome guy with an amazing story of overcoming drug addiction and does this for free based on donations he receives. Look him up on Facebook if you're interested!
The last 7 miles were tough rocks. I ended up taking a good spill after having focused on my footing for so long. I hit my hip, knee and smacked my head on a rock enough to wake me up for sure. Nothing serious and I'll push on but a wake up call. If I don't leave PA with any injuries at all it would be a miracle.
That night I decided to tent at the shelter while Two Clicks joined a few flip floppers and former thru hikers out for a section hike. They were all really nice but I only chatted while eating before jumping in my tent and hanging out for the rest of the night as fog rolled in.","Hamburg, PA
",Allentown Hiking Club Shelter,"May 27, Sun",22.20
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592191,"I woke up a few times last night to the drizzle on my tent. The rain never got heavy but it was steady and then the wind would knock it off the trees making it seem like it rained for much longer. A wet tent wasn't a big deal. I figured I'd dry it out tonight when I tented again. I was out of camp by 6:45 and the start of the day was over nice terrain. Only a minor amount of rocks and smooth ups and downs. Then we hit the knifes edge. Having rained last night, you can imagine a rock formation called the knifes edge may not be super fun. It wasn't. The rocks had zero traction and you're lucky if they are angled in any direction remotely horizontal. It was slow going but I think Two Clicks and I enjoyed being near each other for this section because of the likelihood of injury. Neither of us sustained anything more than cuts and bruises but I will admit, the swears were flying. After knifes edge, we hiked Bake Oven Knob-- what a weird name-- but again, more rocks.
Shortly after those two climbs about 12 or so miles in I approached a road. Here, I heard a car approaching and was curious because often times these dirt roads are desolate. As I got near the road crossing I met eyes with the driver and low and behold, it was Fresh Ground with the Leap Frog Cafe. He poked his head out the window and said ""ready for lunch?"" before he even parked his car. I walked over with a huge smile on my face and helped him unload his equipment and set up. This man has a system and it's amazing to watch! In 5 minutes he had snacks galore out and began cooking me a burger! By this time, Two Clicks and another thru hiker called No Name showed up. We sat around, ate watermelon, fruits, little Debbie snacks and then the colossal burger he made us. It was even seasoned! This man is unreal and I'm sure we'll be catching up to him more and more throughout the trail. The only bad thing about all the free food is my food bag still weighs close to the same it did coming out of Hamburg! But hey, that'll just extend my next resupply past the original spot!
As Fresh Ground said, we had just completed some of the hardest Rocky sections of PA and had a lot easier terrain here on. He was right and the three us of jaunted down into the Lehigh Valley. Although the terrain was easier, we still had a 1300 foot climb in 0.7 miles! The climb out of the valley was crazy. Definitely the steepest on trail yet and often required hands and feet literally climbing rocks. Oh and did I mention, this section is the longest stretch without water we'll face. Roughly 20 miles which to PCT or CDT hikers isn't much but it's unheard of on the AT. I carried 3L of water weighing over 6lbs and the others did the same. With a full food bag, my pack was heavy! The good thing was that even though we were going to camp before the next water, I didn't need to cook tonight because Fresh Ground had fed us so much I could just eat my lunch for dinner! It all worked out. Once we reached the top of the Lehigh Gap we looked back at the Lehigh Valley and River. It was a beautiful section. The top of the mountain had Zinc Smelting going on until 1980 so the ATC and other groups are working on reforestation of the area and so it offered much different terrain and views than the past few days.
We pushed another 6 or so miles past the climb and found a stealth spot. It was nice. Two Clicks and I set up camp, ate a bunch then did quick chores. We hung a bear bag and had some laughs with this then ended up turning in early to chill and listen to our books. We both love going to bed early which makes hiking together great! I will be leaving PA early Wednesday and hitting New Jersey around the 1300 mile marker! It's all moving so quickly!","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592296,"Every morning I'm amazed by my body. I literally put it through hell and back daily and after a decent night sleep, I'm up and doing it again with only minor aches and pains. Pennsylvania has literally chewed me up and spit me out but yet myself and all the other thru hikers I know keep pushing. When you fall in the woods alone, you can either feel sorry for yourself and stop or take a sip of water, tell yourself to slow down and push through it. It's uncaring and unfriendly but it's reality. It builds character though, right? At least I hope it does because that's what I've been telling myself.
For 20 out of the 24ish miles today, we navigated rocks. It gets pretty tiring and overwhelming mentally focusing on each step for hours and hours all day. Sometimes you get in a groove and can speed through it while other times you are literally stubbing your toe and tripping over every rock. For me I'd say I typically hike in the latter situation seeing as though my new shoes have been on trail for a week and already have rubber peeling off. Just cosmetic but PA eats shoes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
At noon we had had only 9 miles left in the day. Two Clicks and I ended up finding a shady spot and sat down for lunch. both of us seemed to be thinking the same thing then finally we said, want to go into town for food? We figured it was still really early and we would make good time to camp. Wind Gap, PA was only a mile away so we figured it couldn't hurt to try our luck at hitching for ten minutes and if it didn't work we would just do our normal thing and hike North. We crossed the street and stuck our things out for less than 5 minutes before a car coming the opposite direction stopped and had us hop in. It was an older couple and they drove us right to the spot we wanted... The ice cream shop.
Inside we each got large ice creams. I had death by chocolate, cookies and cream and cookie dough mixed together and it was amazing. The owner even gave us some free bottled water to refill on our 13 mile stretch without water. We enjoyed the A/C then hopped back outside to try our luck at getting out of town. It's usually much harder to hitch out of town. Luckily, a woman-- again coming from the opposite direction-- pulled over only after a few minutes. It must be the haircut, or maybe the beard trim. Either way, we had successfully heroed in and out of town only spending $6.
The last 9 miles were some of the most monotonous on trail yet. Rocky and no views. You do learn to love the fern covered forests but as much as I try to enjoy it, I really wish my efforts could go towards a nice view or a cool lake or stream but it all adds up over the trail.
At the shelter I grabbed water but couldn't stand the people there. I made it a quick stop then pushed to a tentsite with a view only a few tenths of a mile past the shelter. Here, Two Clicks and I set up tent, ate dinner and hung around. He is learning how to do a bunch of  yoyo tricks so it's fun to watch. It was a great view with enough sun left to dry things and a good breeze. We figured it would be a great way to end PA as we were only 7 trail miles from Jersey but of course a few backpackers came and set up shop too, with alcohol, so it may get noisy tonight. Just another obstacle to push past! We're both really excited to get out of PA. Although the rocks don't stop, they at least mellow out a bit and that's all we need. Just another step closer to Katahdin! Until then though, we keep pushing on! ","Stealth Camp mile 1265

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592481,"An early morning on trail and Two Clicks and I hiked the 6 miles to the Delaware Water Gap together. The descent was fun and when we arrived in town we decided to do a quick resupply then go to the diner while charging our phones. The gas station was perfect for resupply and it only took about 20 minutes. We then wandered into the Apple Pie Cafe down the street. Here, we ran into a bunch of thru hikers who had stayed the night at the donation based church hostel in town. Ripple, Database, no name and a few others were there. As I was getting ready to order, Ripple said ""fresh ground is at the hostel"" and the place emptied. I ended up staying and still grabbing some food and coffee before making my way there to partake in the fun. Here, I ran into Snapper and Michigan, Jackalope and Screaming Eagle. We ate more delicious food from Fresh Ground. I had banana pancakes and some Gatorade and snacks. Other people had omelettes too! I love this man.
After our electronics had a chance to charge and we were full, we hiked out into the sunshine. On I-80, we crossed the Delaware River and over into New Jersey officially before climbing back up to the ridge. I think I had some completely wild expectation that the Delaware River had magical powers to stop the PA rocks from extending past them. This was wrong. The rocks didn't stop but I will say they mellowed out a bit. My feet and soul don't hurt as much!
Up on the ridge we passed by sunfish pond and then dropped into a gap where the Mohican Appalachian Mountain Club lodge was. I could use my AMC member discount too! Two Clicks, Snapper, Michigan and I all stopped here for a Gatorade and a bit of a rest not that we needed it that badly. Here, I ran into a man that went by Jersey Tom. He lives in Jersey and hikes the area often and had been following my journal. It was cool that he recognized me! Nice to meet you Tom!
After the brief break we all pushed on up and over a mountain that had a fire tower. Jersey has been a nice change of pace with views and towers such as this compared to PA. Enjoying it a lot!
Fresh Ground had said he may post up at the next gap for dinner and we all were secretly hoping he would without saying it to sound greedy. When we got there, there was no sign of him so we kept pushing north. No big deal. 2.7 miles later, we came up to the tentsite we had planned on staying at. Jersey doesn't allow you to legally camp anywhere so we have to aim for shelters or campsites. When we got there, some teenage group had taken over. There were about 20 of them and they hadn't set up camp yet so we figured we could. One of the leaders came over to us and told us they had more coming and asked us to please move further north. We did so but that's not typically how it's supposed to work. About 0.5 miles north we found a spot clear enough for two tents and a spot to eat. We unloaded gear tired from the day. Maybe even more tired than normal. Then shit got real.
We had both set up our tents and began laying out our sleeping bags and pads. I walked over to a rock and was using a baby wipe to clean my feet with my food bag next to me sealed up with my stomach growling anticipating dinner. All of a sudden I look up and just to my left north on the trail. A black bear was coming south on the trail and right towards us. I stood up and told Two Clicks as the two of us began yelling and making noise to scare it off. It's not the first time we've seen a bear but the rest of the story was unique. This bear had zero fear of us. It stopped when we began yelling but never backed up. The only time it made a big move was when two clicks threw something near it and it ran into the woods west of the trail. From there it continued to move towards us as we persisted with our yelling and noise. Eventually it got close enough where we were forced out of the campsite leaving our stuff. I'll admit I was definitely too close to the bear when it bluff charged me. This is when it charges for a quick second before stopping. It's enough to wake you up and that was the final straw for us to back off and yield to it. It came in camp and began sniffing. First near Two Clicks tent then over towards where I was sitting. It sniffed my shoes and I secretly hoped those would stun him haha. No luck. He looked left and smelt my food back then took a bite into it and sprinted off into the woods. Damn.
What else could we have done? This bear clearly has done this before and even the AT app called Guthooks warns of active bears in the area. We've always been really adamant about bear hangs using the PCT hang but what can you do when you're just about to eat after a long day and an adolescent bear pushes you out. It's a shame it happened and that I lost a full resupply of food along with my stove but life goes on. We made the best of it and I'm lucky to be with Two Clicks who helped feed me dinner. Luckily I also had saved two protein bars and a pack of crackers to supplement my food needs for the night and the morning where we would push into Branchville, NJ to get food. At least my food bag wasn't still in my pack where the bear may have stolen that too. Who knows but all I can do now is warn hikers I know behind, let the trail maintenance club know and laugh at the story while being grateful I can still hike. Jersey, you have lived up to your name.
Well the bear was still in the area and we didn't want to lose Two Clicks' bag or have any other issues so we pushed on. Unfortunately another 4 miles hiking up until sunset. We managed to get to camp and eat a small bit before complete darkness but were happy to be around a few other hikers including Snapper and Michigan.
That night we had hung our bear bag but still heard screeching calls that we had trouble figuring out what could be making that noise. Possibly a raccoon, weasel or some rodent? It was a long night but I did sleep pretty well.

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592501,"Woke up this morning to a misty, wet tent. Hunger was setting in but realistically it was only because I knew I had no food. If I had some I knew I wouldn't be this hungry. I ate my six cheese crackers, the last of my food then pushed hard to town. I figured why stop when I would just get wet and couldn't eat? The 7.5 miles went quick and I made it to US 260 and waited for Two Clicks. I sat there and chatted with another thru hiker hitching into town. When Two Clicks arrived we decided to head to the diner in town and he agreed to staying at a motel in town. I figured it would be good to eat well, shower, hang out and brush off yesterday. I also wanted to focus on my new food needs as I'll be eating cold until I figure out where I can either buy a new stove or have it sent to me. Weirdly enough, im not too worried about it. Maybe I've gotten too comfortable with how the trail works but it seems to always provide. And plus, Branchville didn't have any outfitters so I couldn't get anything here.
We had a nice couple ask if we needed a ride as we sat at the trailhead and took them up on that offer. They dropped us off at the diner and we were very grateful! Here, we took our time eating a ton and sipping on coffee before heading to the market. Never resupply on an empty stomach!
Next, we walked the half mile to the market. It was a pricy resupply especially starting from scratch but I think it'll work well and I'll be all set. We called the motel in town to reserve a room and then hitched there. They let us check in at 11 which was great. We hitched again to the motel about 3 miles from where we were and a nice older gentleman gave us a ride there wishing us well on our journey!
Our motel room was fairly cramped but honestly it was ideal. We just needed a roof and a bed. The people running it were super nice and welcoming! Bonus-- the shower head was amazing! We hung around trying to help them fix our room TV and showering. Around 2 we got a ride to the bar by the owner Leano. We made a deal with him that we didn't need him to work on fixing the TV if he would drive us there. He was happy to do so.
Gyps bar was a great hangout. We tried a few different beers and ate a bunch of food while laughing about our situation. For a few hours we hungout here and enjoyed the views off the back patio of the lake in town. Again, everyone was super nice here! Luckily, Leano agreed to pick us up too so around 5 we gave him a call and he was there within 30 minutes. This gave us enough time to run next door to the fishing store. I tripped on the step in as I was texting and gave the clerk a good laugh. I swear I fall more in towns than on trail although I fall a lot regardless! Here, I got Paracord for bear lines. My old line was with my food in the bag that got taken. I was hopeful I might find a stove too but the one they had wasn't what I was looking for and like I said I wasn't too worried.
When we got back to the motel, the owners wife, their kid and the neighbor who lived there were in our room. I swear I could write a book on this place between the people living here who told us their life story and the shenanigans going on. Anyway, they were awesome and just trying to fix the TV. They had switched out the TV and still had no luck but for some reason I got it to work after playing around for a few minutes. Leano was pumped!
The rest of the night consisted of eating, watching TV and catching up on chores-- journaling, drying things out, and enjoying the rest. Quite an exciting few days but I think Two Clicks and I were happy to do a full-on nearo and chill out ready to tackle the last 40 or so miles of NJ","Campsite mile 1315.6
","Branchville, NJ","May 31, Thu",7.50
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592624,"Two Clicks and I ended up turning down the ride we were offered by the motel owners to the trail at 8:30am. We wanted to get out a bit earlier and figured a hitch would be manageable with people going to work. We were out the door at 6:45 and stood on the other side of the street for at least 15 minutes with no luck as so many cars passed. We started huffing it up the road with our thumbs out. With only feet separating us from the cars zooming by it definitely wasn't the best road to be walking. We couldn't even stick our hands out far in fear of them ripping off when a car passed. Eventually we hit a road that intersects the main road. There, a man was stopped at a stop sign and I kindly approached the car and asked if he could give us a ride the remaining mile or two to the trail. He nodded and said sure. Thanks to Drew we didn't have to walk that far but I imagine we could add 0.5-1 mile of road walk from this morning to our mileage total.
We were at the trail! It began with a small climb out of Branchville then remainded mellow all day with small ups and downs, rocks here and there and a few views by the afternoon once the fog dissipated. It shaped up to be a great day around 1 or 2 with the sun winning the battle over the fog. The humidity was high and the bugs were out so it made it a bit tough but except for the flies dive bombing my eyes, I had a good hiking day.
At lunch I stopped at High Point State Park in NJ where they give thru hikers a free Pepsi. There I sipped on that and ate lunch while talking with Moldy Beans. He is a hiker who southbounded from Katahdin to NY and is now doing Harper's Ferry to his last point in NY. I mentioned our bear encounter and how I was currently stoveless. He said that he would be done his hike In a few days and would be willing to sell his stove and pot to me for a reasonable price once he finishes the trail. I knew the trail would provide! I'll be in the area of him on the trail and when he's done he plans on leaving it in a spot that I can grab it and texting me. I can then Venmo him the money and have a stove once again! So pumped.
We hiked out not far apart on the trail and pushed the last 7 miles to the Secret Shelter. It's a shelter not listed on my guidebook but it is listed on Guthooks. A man named Jim Murray owns land 0.2 from the trail and has a cabin that he opens as an unofficial shelter for hikers. He even let's us use his well water, an outdoor shower and the outlets inside. It's a really cool place to stay right on his farm where it's quiet and the birds are chirping.
Moldy Beans stopped in quickly for a shower. He had fallen in the mud within the last mile and was happy to use it. He then pushed on and was going to get food in the next town then sleep at the next Shelter. As for Two Clicks and I. We got here around 3:30 and decided to stay. It was early but the sun was out and we could dry things out nicely. I also used the shower because, why not? You're welcome civilization. My clothes still haven't been properly washed since the beginning of PA and I won't wash them until MA so regardless-- I smell ripe. Then we hung around enjoying the night and Two Clicks practiced his yoyo tricks. There were donkeys here too! I'm trying my first night going stoveless which basically means I just eat a bunch more junk with calories but I won't have to do it for long. Planning a 30 mile day tomorrow- my first-time-- with breakfast at a deli and dinner at a hot dog spot! Woo!","Branchville, NJ

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592765,"The nights thunderstorms were really nice to listen to. The problem with the shelter was it was so hot! Unbearably enough that I tried my luck at mock cowboy camping on the porch protected by the overhang of the roof. It was awesome at first and so breezy! But, the mosquitoes got the best of me and I moved back inside to soak in my pool of sweat.
We woke up at 5 and Two Clicks' phone wasn't turning on. It had been charging all night and we weren't sure if the lightning had affected it. Luckily, it eventually turned on and at that point we were up. We enjoyed the beautiful morning after the storm and were on trail at 5:45 to make it to Unionville, NY for breakfast! 2 miles in we made it to the general store when it opened and got two bacon, egg and cheeses each along with those Starbucks coffee things. It was amazing! A great breakfast does a lot.
After breakfast we split up to hike our paces and enjoy the day. During the morning we walked through the Wallkill Nature Reserve where there was a ton of wildlife. I saw deer with a fawn, turtles, bunnies, newts, birds and a bunch more. I also ran into the ATC ridge runner for the mid Atlantic section. We got to talking and she asked if I had any crazy bear encounters recently. I kind of laughed then told her the story and she said ""you're the one!? We were told your report and to keep an eye out."" I had reported it to the ATC and the National Park Service actually called me to hear about the encounter to pass on to the NJ Fish and Wildlife.
The climb up Pochuk mountain was a good climb then we descended to a boardwalk through a bog for a mile. It was a nice, peaceful walk but there were a ton of tourists so it kind of took away from it. NJ has had a lot of lowlands and bogs which has been a big change of scenery to PA.
Next, I climbed up the stairway to heaven. It was a popular tourist spot and I had to ask a bunch of big groups to let me pass but they were nice about it. Of course, we climbed the mountain but the view was off trail so I just descended without the luxury of the view. Around 18 miles in I stopped for lunch and ate there as Two Clicks showed up shortly before I took off. It was a nice relaxing lunch and nice to know I only had 12 miles left.
The next 12 miles kicked my butt. 4 miles from lunch, I crossed into NY and immediately got hit with rock scrambles. Enough for there to be a ladder built in with rebar. A lot like NH hiking! I got my cuts and scrapes to commemorate the struggle. On the descent to the road where I planned to go to an ice cream spot, a man named Joe gave me a Gatorade and two protein cookies! He's a former chief of police in NJ and we chatted for 30 minutes about police work and his time as an EMT. He was a great guy!
At the road I walked 0.3 off trail to a creamery. They make their own ice cream and it was awesome! I got a chocolate sundae with Oreos, m&ms, hot fudge, whipped cream and a cherry. I also got a root beer. As I hung around with Moldy Beans, a maintainer in the area showed up. He talked with us for a while about his thru hike and gave us each a beer! What a great spot. I layed with my shoes off and my feet airing out, phone charging, and belly full! After an hour I figured I should move on and I pushed 2 miles to the shelter. At the trailhead, though, someone left a 6 pack of Budweiser and I carried out a can to the shelter. It was great to have beer at night too! The 30 miler was a nice thing to check off but not something I plan on doing often. I felt good but the heat and bugs drained me and I'm looking forward to returning to ""normal"" mileage. Happy I did it though and happy to check off another state!

P.S: Hi Mrs Young's! I'm glad you're liking the journal! I was really happy to have Two Clicks with me for the bear too! It's nice to experience something like that with someone else especially when they've had bear encounters before. Also extremely grateful he provided me dinner that night! It was a long day!","The Secret Shelter
",Wildcat Shelter,"Jun 02, Sat",30.20
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592877,"Overnight the temperatures dropped fairly drastically. When we woke up it was around 55 degrees and felt like a cool fall morning with the wind blowing. I got on trail normal time to start the crazy ascents and descents of the day. We began by passing a waterfall then eventually hit Harriman State Park. Along the way, at many of the road crossings, trail angels had left gallon water jugs for us to fill up. It's amazing the difference in water quality as we move north. We are pulling from much darker streams that are somewhat sketchy rather than clear mountain springs like down south. We also have to worry about the beavers in the water that can transmit giardia. The water jugs were a nice surprise!
Harriman State Park had kinder trails. The kind of trails that are widely used as day hikes so the bouldering was at a minimum for a bit. I passed a bunch of people out enjoying the comfortable temperature and overcast skies. Perfect for hiking! I then entered the lemon squeeze which was a tight squeeze through a rock crevasse. So small that I had to take off my pack and toss it up to the top to fit! Reminded me a lot of a place I used to go as a kid near Franconia, NH. Boulders and tight squeezes! It was cool!
The rest of the morning was over small rolling hills that still got my heart rate up. A few ponds and creeks along the way provided different scenes. Plenty of wildlife as usual-- I think I see at least one deer a day. Unfortunately I wasn't feeling it much today though. I think the long day yesterday had drained my energy (no blisters or anything though!) And the quick change in weather was playing around with my head. Anyway, my push for the day was to lunch! I took it 0.4 miles off trail at a state park where there were vending machines. It's the simple things out here! A soda and an iced tea beside a lake helped a lot but by the end of my 45min lunch I was shivering! Getting back on trail I warmed up quickly.
I had about 7 miles left to camp and it was only 1 so I took the rest of the day in leisure. I met two clicks who had passed me while I ate off trail and we enjoyed the last few miles laughing about the day. We crossed the pallisades which was crazy! The cars came wizzing by especially on the Eastward side headed to NYC. We played a legit game of Frogger dodging cars to get to the wooded median then doing the same on the Westward side. It was a cool change of pace and adrenaline rush! I bet those driving by thought we were crazy!
We walked 0.6 miles off trail for the shelter for the night! Normally we would never do that but it was going to rain and we had to tent tomorrow so 1/2 nights we wanted to be dry. Plus we didn't have anymore shelter options for 33 miles!
Funny story about the stove. So I was going to buy it off Moldy Beans as stated before. Well, today he was going to give it to me after he cooked his last lunch. However, he accidentally left the stove at the last shelter and only had the gas and pot left. So the stove is lost but I have a pot and gas. My parents are visiting Tuesday and luckily I have another stove at home and they'll be bringing it! So no worries but what a strange occurrence. Buying a stove off a guy with the trail name Moldy Beans... probably not my best idea haha. Just kidding he's a really cool guy.

Two clicks and I are the only ones in the shelter tonight. No flip floppers or section hikers which is kind of a nice change of pace. We're bracing for what seems to be a crazy storm coming in tonight as we overlook the Hudson and hope to see NYC skyscraper lights at night. Tomorrow we hit Bear Mountain State Park and a convenience store on trail with hot food! Woo! Also extremely pumped to see my parents, get some food with them and stay in a hotel. They're making a last minute trip down to see me and it's crazy to think the last time they came, about 2.5 weeks ago, it was an 8 hour drive and this time it's a 3.5 hour drive. I didn't even have to wait in traffic to make it north!","Wildcat Shelter
",West Mountain Shelter,"Jun 03, Sun",22.80
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593058,"We woke up this morning and chatted about the cold night. It dropped low enough for it to be uncomfortable at one point in the night but nothing undoable. The storm had rolled in and all night it rained hard and the wind blew. Two Clicks looked at the radar and noticed it was expected to be past us by 7 or 8 am so we made it a ""lazy"" morning to wait out the rain. By 6:30 it had pretty much stopped as the fog lifted and the water only fell off the trees. After breakfast in bed-- a poptart and protein bar in my sleeping bag-- we got to packing and were still out by 7.
We descended from West Mountain then climbed up to Bear Mountain, a very popular spot in NY for it's proximity to the city and it's view of the Hudson/city skyline. Luckily the rain held off and we just had to hike in some fog and colder temperatures. Even then, it was extremely comfortable hiking weather and we were still in tshirts and shorts unless we stopped moving for a bit. At the top of the mountain we took advantage of the vending machines and each got a Coke. Then, we descended to Bear Mountain State Park. We walked through the park then across RT 9 to the ""zoo."" This is a popular landmark on trail where the AT literally walks down the middle of this animal rehabilitation center. The animals here were all injured at one point and rehabilitated. We actually waited 15 minutes at the front gate for the zoo to open just to walk through. If you get there when it's closed there is a bypass trail but we wanted to do it and say we did! Once we cut through the zoo which is the lowest elevation on the entire AT around 124 ft, we crossed the Hudson River over the Bear Mountain Bridge. This was exciting and the past day or two have made me feel closer and closer to home. Heck, I'll be in MA by Friday. Oh, by the way, Two Clicks and I hit 1400 miles before the ascent up Bear Mountain. It's funny because NOBOs no longer write out every 100 miles with sticks. Instead I feel most of us are counting down what we have left and we are under 800 miles from Katahdin!
After the Bear Mountain Bridge, we ascended two steeper mountains before walking a short Ridgeline. At the bottom of the ridge was the Appalachian trail market. It's basically a gas station but right on Trail that offers a deli, pizza and gas station snacks! Heaven! We had pushed hard the last few miles and made it here by noonish giving us enough time to eat and charge while sitting around as the sun came out. We had hiked halfway for the day and this was a good morale boost. Plus, my diet has been lacking lately so the chicken parm sandwich, donut, banana, Gatorade, coffee and slice of pizza I had filled me up. Plus I packed out two pieces of pizza for later!
From here, Two Clicks and I split up and enjoyed the second half of the day. It was beautiful hiking weather and somewhat easier terrain than the last two days. About 5 miles from Heaven, I mean the gas station, I hit a road where some people were doing trail magic. They were Bruiser, Mumbles and Buffalo-- all hikers from the last few years that knew Shiver, the girl who I had hiked with back in VA, very well. Crazy coincidence! I ate a donut, some cookies and a Gatorade then pushed on. Thanks guys!
Not far after seeing them, another man named Dave was Trailside. He was just sitting on a dirt road next to his car reading when I got there and asked a bunch of questions about the hike. He then offered me some chocolate and I took it and pushed ahead!
The terrain was nice here and we passed an old foundation where General George Washington had set up some sort of treatment center during a small pox outbreak in the civil war. You really could feel the history in these woods and it was fun! I jammed to my country music (I know not everyone likes country but those that do will understand) and it made my hike go by a bit more enthusiastically. I haven't been listening to the iPod as much lately but when the time is right- it's right.
We rolled into the area of Clarence Fahnestock State Park and camped close to the water of the pond. I ate my pizza quickly and did chores as it was a bit later in the evening then when we normally finish. It was a long but packed day and we managed to see and experience a lot in such a short time while pushing longer mileage. The hope is to push into Pawling, NY tomorrow and meet up with my parents for a night in a hotel and a restock of essentials! It'll be awesome to see them!","West Mountain Shelter
",Canopus Lake,"Jun 04, Mon",26.60
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593190,"Tenting in a field is wet! My fly was soaked even though it only sprinkled a tiny bit in the late evening. I packed it up and threw it on the back of my pack just to avoid it soaking everything in my bag. We were headed to town anyway so water wasn't a huge concern. 
The morning was beautiful! It was like hiking in the fall with a nice cool breeze and sun shining through the leaves here and there. We were both excited to get to town and Two Clicks was excited to get to the post office to pick up his package from home with a new tent, new shoes and some resupply.
We pushed miles and by 1230 we stopped for a break at a shelter roughly 8 miles from the road to town. I grabbed some metallic tasting water from the well there then pushed on! The skies had opened up only a few minutes prior and dumped rain on us. It was quick but man was I soaked. We passed some huge oak trees. One on trail and one right at the road we ended at! NY supposedly had the largest one on trail but the AWOL guide I have hasn't mentioned if one of these are the largest. 
The 8 miles went quickly in retrospect but my feet and mentality were feeling fatigued. When I know I'm going into town and living in luxury I tend to forget I still have to hike there. In this case, I forgot I had 22 miles to hike and when I do the math and figure out how long that'll take it gets to me.
Anyway, by the time I reached the road it began raining again. The clouds looked ominous! I sat under that big oak tree as good coverage waiting for Two Clicks. When he got there, we started the walk to town. It was 3.1 miles east but we didn't plan on walking that whole way. Now I fully admit to this-- we broke the law! Hitching in NY is illegal but man we didn't want to do 3 miles on the road. We thumbed the first few cars that passed but there weren't many on this small side road. Eventually a chair car van pulled over and offered us a ride. Ambulance services typically have ambulances for higher care patients for interfacility transfers and chair car vans for transfers from hospital to home for those patients bound to a wheelchair. Well the guy that gave us a ride was a wheel chair van driver and we kneeled in the back next to he wheelchair for a ride into town. His ""patient"" was in the passenger seat with the music blasting. Hahaha we really do experience some weird stuff.
When he dropped us downtown, an Italian sounding man yelled, ""I'm going to report you!"" Seemingly joking. Two Clicks said ""what a welcome to town."" We got into conversation with him about what we were doing and he asked if we had our minds checked before starting. Great question!
We made our way to the post office for Two Clicks to get his package with his new tent and shoes in it then went next door to the bar to wait for my family to show up in town.
When my parents rolled up we paid our tabs and greeted them. It was great seeing them and they always bring a bunch of great food and think of everything. They brought us to Hannaford for a resupply then to the hotel. Here, we checked in and got our clothes ready for laundry. Two clicks jumped in the shower and I tried to start laundry but of course, the washer was out of order! My parents offered to bring them down to the Laundromat and had to bare the smell of laundry untouched by soap since mile 1100! Thank you so much! Probably the worst we've smelt and I know my sister and uncle could tell you we smelt bad with them. We showered, spread things out to dry and then went to dinner before hanging out for the night in the hotel. So gracious my parents came out and that they support myself and friends in everything we do. Love you guys!","Canopus Lake
",Pawling NY,"Jun 05, Tue",21.90
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593262,"The morning in the hotel began with us packing our bags before breakfast. We managed to take up the entire room with our gear hanging out to dry. My tent fly was hanging from the closet to the blow dryer along with sleeping bags draped over lamps and stuff sacks off of arm chairs. It's a sight! Just ask my parents!
We made it down to breakfast and they served us before 7 luckily! Coffee, juice, a waffle, bagels, toast and a banana filled me up then we went back upstairs to head out. The trail was 30 minutes away but the drive took us along small back roads and through towns with funky names like Fishkill. Eventually we made it! At the trailhead we had left off at, a flip flopper named No Doubt and a few section hikers were there. We offered them my mom's homemade muffins and No Doubt took up the offer. He kept coming back for more and must have loved them! It's hard not to love my mom's cooking! The section hikers didn't want any food. They must not have hiker hunger yet haha. I think my parents liked seeing the big tree at the trailhead too.
I said a temporary goodbye to them as Two Clicks hiked on. The weather was beautiful. Temps probably in the 60s or 70s and overcast skies. Great hiking weather. My parents were going to meet us roughly 10 miles in to give us lunch. They were also going to run to an outfitter somewhat nearby to grab me new insoles for my shoes. Unfortunately the other ones we got sent from Amazon were the wrong size. After selecting a size, the order was then placed for a different size that was smaller. I got a refund though so no big deal!
The hiking was beautiful through the rest of NY. Rolling hills and a nice ridge walk. A few miles before our lunch meetup, Two Clicks and I took a break at a shelter then crossed the border into CT 0.6miles north. The Gateway to New England! As the sign says.
We met my parents in a parking lot off CT RT 55 where they had gotten my insoles, bought us turkey sandwiches from Subway and stuffed us full of homemade food! What an awesome time! They were our personal trail angels (or trail magicians as my dad liked to say) and I can't thank them enough. Two Clicks thanked them and hiked ahead as we wrapped up lunch. Luckily though, No Doubt was passing by and we were able to feed him too! He was extremely grateful and again, loved the muffins! We left a few things at the trailhead for other hikers with a note to pack out trash but honestly the trail around us is pretty quiet I imagine only one or two more AT hikers will pass it in the next day or so.
After saying goodbye to my parents and thanking them for being the best people in the world, they drove off. They ended up passing me a few times on the road as I hiked to the trail. Luckily for me I have one direction to walk where they have to figure out the GPS. It was funny though! Crazy to think that in their time driving home I would only end up walking 11 miles north. Depressing to think about but seeing how far I have walked makes me feel a little better.
Now the rest of the day was tough. Connecticut really welcomes us well! Some steep climbs made me feel great and I actually really enjoyed it under the overcast skies. I had some nice views from exposed rocks and I'm looking forward to passing the Housatonic river tomorrow. I swear I have a super power of smelling day hikers. It's probably only because I smell so bad and have gotten use to the smells around me but I could smell a couple today. Just their fresh laundry and clean hair/body. I'm not kidding, at times I smell them before seeing them! I made it to the shelter around 430 which was great timing for a late start and an hour break. I'm so pumped to be in CT and it really feels like I'm closer to home. I chatted with a few flip Floppers, No Doubt, and Two Clicks while eating as much food as I could to cut pack weight then headed to bed. didn't even lay down before slicing my toe open a bit and bleeding pretty good. Whatever! Builds character. Anyway, I really enjoyed the hiking today and the weather and loved to see my parents! Thank you guys for everything! I think Two Clicks and I are really looking forward to zeroing in Westfield on Saturday once we hit MA. As for now, we get to enjoy the small northwest section of CT!

P.S: thanks for following still Skip! I think it's fun to look at the GPS tracks and see how far I've gone! I'll have to post a picture of it for others to see! Got my new stove now and back to cooking! That bear ate well but also ate all my multi vitamins and I bet that didn't sit well! ","Pawling NY

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593343,"It was a chilly morning but a nice way to start off a long hike. Before leaving I used the privy and there was a bird's nest with a baby bird in it right next to me! It was cool but I felt bad this baby bird had to grow up in a privy!
The cool morning weather was nice and after a few climbs, I decended down to the Housatonic river with Two Clicks for a long 5 mile walk along the river edge. These flat sections are nice but dang, they hurt my feet! Two clicks and I finished the beautiful walk then once again climbed. The climbs were tough today. It felt a lot like the roller coaster in northern VA. CT is throwing some haymakers our way! Add on 28 miles of hiking to the mix and man I was beat. We had an early morning coffee stop and got our caffeine fix but 17 miles in during lunch, I had to have more and downed another cup. This is no fancy coffee. This is bottom barrel instant coffee cooked in a camping pot but man it helps! The first cup did a ton but the second didn't have as much of a kick. Regardless of that, the lunch calories helped.
After lunch we pushed the remaining 12 miles. A few mellow ups and downs then, to end the day, we had an 800' climb. For some reason I was so tired I struggled with the last few miles. Today pushed me mentally and physically for sure but it's done!
We debated staying in the shelter because it was 0.5 off trail. That's a good distance! However, stealth camping in CT isn't really accepted here and there was no guarantee there would be spots at the stream a mile past the shelter so we ended up going down the steep hill to the shelter. It worked out and we were the only ones crazy enough to hike off trail this far until 7 when a thru hiker and her friend showed up. They ended up cooking popcorn and shared with us so that was nice! A tough day but were looking forward to MA tomorrow, hitting the 1500 mile marker and taking a much needed zero in Westfield.
P.S: I just want to thank all those people continuing to follow my journal! Lots of you have posted on my Facebook or on the guest book and it makes writing these each night much more worth it! Thanks for the continued support and encouragement!","Mt Algo Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593489,"We were both excited this morning knowing we'd be hitting some big milestones. 1500 miles, Two Clicks would be entering his home state and I'd be entering familiar territory from going to school in Westfield and a ZERO! It was nice being the only two in the shelter too because once we get up we don't have to worry about being quiet!
We hiked the 0.5 blue blazed back to trail and swore at the steep climb the whole way. We rolled down the ridge then began the climb up Bear Mountain, the second bear Mountain we've climbed. This one was a lot harder than the Bear Mountain in NY but still nothing too crazy. It was a great view from the top and really, truly felt like New England hiking which got us excited.
We had three bigger climbs to do today and Bear Mountain was the first. We descended into Sage's Ravine which was a really cool place! A river ran down the middle with steep drops leading to numerous swimming holes. We eventually hit the MA border! 1500 miles of hiking have led me back to what I would consider my second home. Having had gone to school an hour from the trail for just under 4 years has definitely made MA a more welcoming and more familiar state for me. I was pumped to hike up from Sage's Ravine to Mt Race where I had done a day hike with my former teacher, colleague and current friend Mike Tryon.
This morning I had a strange inkling he may have been lying about working today. I texted him jokingly saying that I'd see him at the top of Mt Race and knowing his sly ways, he admitted that he was indeed hiking to the peak to meet us! I got up to the top after a long slow incline with some sweet views along a ridge for about 0.5miles. It really felt more like home hiking ridges with views to wilderness and few cities.
At the top I waited for both Two Clicks and Mike to show up. About five minutes later, when Two Clicks and I were sitting, Mike peaked the mountain with two signs reading ""Homebound"" and ""Two Clicks."" Unreal hahahaha. Mike had hiked roughly 7.5 miles to this peak in honor of our day hike we did two years ago. It's like we were reliving those days when I was just thinking about the AT. Now, I had hiked here from Georgia and couldn't believe it. That trail Mike had showed me did in fact go all the way to Springer! Crazy!
We drank some Michelob Ultra, Mike's favorite drink, on top of the mountain. He also packed out hoagies, nutty buddy's and a bunch of other snacks we craved. It was a great lunch!
After lunch we descended Mt Race, then began our final major climb for the day up Mt Everett. Or was it Mt Everest? Probably the latter. Man was it steep! Only a quick 0.7 miles up to the top but the gain of nearly 1000' caused us to feel every step. My muscles felt great after the completion. The three of us then began the descent down to the car from Mt Everett. Funny thing was that a girl named ""Happy Feet"" from MA has been following our hike. Shes hoping to do the AT next year and is currently attempting the Long Trail in VT. She had messaged me a day before with a picture of two baggies hanging from a tree. One was for each of us! She had left us some trail magic that had a Snickers bar (a double I may add) and a note wishing us well.Thanks Happy Feet! We've never met her but it was super cool of her to do that on her day of hiking
After finding the trail magic we stopped at a shelter to leave a note marking Mike's hike today and his kind offer to take us back to his place and allow us to zero there! Weirdly enough, the shelter was built on his birthday just in 1986! Crazy coincidence!
When we got to the car, Two Clicks and I pushed on 0.9 past the car to MA 41 where Mike drove around to meet us. It was a great hike and Mike ended up doing right around 15 miles today which was impressive! MA gave us some good climbs to start on!
We drove, windows down, on the back roads of Egremont to Great Barrington. It's funny being back out here as I had done a few hikes while at school and a bunch of us from the Blandford FD drove out to Egremont two years in a row to support their fire department for a steak dinner fundraiser. The wind and sun felt great! We made a quick stop in Great Barrington to check for a few things we needed but no luck. We ended up driving to the Barrington Brewery for late lunch early Dinner.
This place has special meaning to Mike and I. When we had last done Mt Race, we stopped here afterwards and chatted with an older couple part of the mug club at the bar. We had told them of my plans to hike the AT when I was just starting to prep and now here we were, two years later and 1500 miles in successfully hiked to MA. The bartender helped us figure out who they were based off description and we ended up buying them tokens for a beer each as well as leaving a card with a note hoping they'd remember! It was awesome! Thanks to the bartenders (Tina and Matt) you guys were great. Also good luck to Matt on his preparation for thru hiking the AT too!
We drove into Westfield and showered, did laundry, and hung around. Eventually we met up with Mike's Dad for a bit and then grabbed food and returned to eat and watch the movie 'Sully.' I didn't get to bed until 1am! Crazy! But I'm really looking forward to tomorrow's day off and relaxing.","Limestone Spring shelter

Mike was extremely generous to bring us here and we did our best to get in and out without spending all our money. I bought some fuel, deet and batteries... All small stuff. Two clicks got new trekking poles and was pumped for those.
On the way home we ran to Walmart for a resupply, the liquor store and Stop and Shop for me to pick up a cake I had ordered. Mike's birthday was next week and another friend of mine, Jake Sanborn, had his birthday coming up too. Low and behold a few others that I knew from the area had birthdays in June too and so we acknowledged those too as I'll mention in a minute.
Mike had surprised me with a kayaking trip. We have done one every year (Mike, Chris Perkins, Tom Mulligan and I) but unfortunately it didn't look like the timing was going to work as I mentioned I would be in MA on the 8th. Mike and Chris, however, put together a quick trip on the Westfield River though and so we did that today. Two Clicks opted out and slept at the house
The river was beautiful and we found a rope swing to jump into the water. We enjoyed a leisurely cruise down the river until about 6.
When we got everything back to the house, Mike ran to a house warming party he had promised to go to. He wasn't gone long but in the meantime, I began prepping our dinner he had bought-- steak, potatoes and broccoli. While I started that, friends started showing up and I kept them company until Mike returned. I had invited Jake and a few others from the Blandford Fire Department to come by for cake and Mike had invited some of his friends. When I got the chance I showered then we ate and wished everyone a happy birthday. Eventually, after socializing for a bit, I made my way upstairs for a bit of sleep. The sun had really tired me out and I knew I would need anything I could get for hiking tomorrow.
Our zero was great and I want to thank Mike so much for allowing us to stay at his home, raid his food and shuttle us around everywhere. I also want to thank Chris for the kayaking and all those who made an appearance at Mike's home last night!","MA 41 Egremont, MA

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593625,"I woke up dreading the actual act of movement. All I wanted to do was lay in that comfortable bed and listen to the birds outside. I think myself and many others are getting to a point on trail where it pushes you mentally like crazy.
I packed my things and brought them downstairs to the smell of bacon. Mike had woken up early and began cooking breakfast for us. Bacon, eggs, pancakes, potatoes and toast. It was quite the meal and really got me going. After cleaning up and packing the car we began the drive to the trail. It was a beautiful cool day, with overcast skies.
At the trailhead we took final pictures and thanked Mike for his extreme kindness. He hoped to meet up with us again and hike a few other sections with us. We began the walk into the meadows we had left off on and for the first few miles we had somewhat level walking on the edges of farms.
Slowly, the climbs began once again and the time went by quickly as I worked to reintegrate myself with my surroundings. Getting the ball rolling once again can be hard. Especially when you have to react to vast amounts of stimuli in society, whereas in the woods, stimulus exists but you don't necessarily need to react to it. Constantly reading and interpreting road signs, keeping the beat of the music on the radio, having conversations as opposed to walking and simply listening to my body and navigating the woods. It's a tough transition. I stopped for a long break around 2 at a shelter to catch up on journaling, eat and rest my feet. I had passed over Rt 23 to Monterey which brought back memories of calls for the Fire Department in Blandford on Rt 23. It was weird knowing the towns and areas around you but seeing them from the woods and a completely different setting.
I made the final push to the campsite that fell around the mileage Two Clicks and I were comfortable hiking. Before getting there I took a good spill when I was nonchalantly walking along some footbridge over a bog. Somehow I turned 180 degrees, smashed my head on the wooden plank and landed to the side in some tall grass that luckily wasn't wet because it hadn't rained in a while. I was pretty mad and it was quite the spill but honestly I do it so much that I'm kind of getting used to it sadly.
I made it to camp at 4:30 and set up my tent, grabbed water and gave a call to Abby. Tonight I was hoping to eat early and go to bed early to make up for the lack of sleep the last two nights. I think I'll sleep pretty well tonight!

He's working on ways to stay warmer and I think this pattern will probably continue as we get higher in elevation and into the Green Mountains and the Whites.
The day started slow as I knew Two Clicks' mom was coming and he had said that if I wanted to join them for lunch to be at MA rt 20 at noon. That was about 11 miles from camp so it made for a peaceful morning. I saw deer grazing in a field, passed a snack shack run by a family on the honor system and enjoyed he beautiful weather. MA has treated us well.
Around 1030 I met up with Two Clicks near Upper Goose Pond. This has been a popular talking point when discussing the MA section of the AT. It is run by the AMC with a caretaker as a cabin on donations. We stopped here for a break and marveled at the beauty of the pond. Eventually, we decided, we needed to canoe! They had free canoes to take out after signing a waiver and so we did that. We only paddled out to an island and back but it was beautiful and a great change of pace midday hiking. I highly recommend this place! It would have been cool to stay at but it was too early and we were meeting Mama Two Clicks in a bit. Definitely a place I'll be visiting in the future!
We pushed the 2 miles to MA rt 20 after crossing over the Mass Pike and taking our pictures near the Berkshires Sign. When we got there, we waited only a few minutes then Mrs Young's pulled up with Two Clicks' friend Tim as well. We said our hello's then jumped in for a ride into Lee, MA for food! Mrs Young's was gracious enough to buy me lunch and I wolfed down a pizza, root beer and some mozzarella sticks and onion rings while making sure to also drink a water. Everyone ate well and before I left I ran next door to Subway to pack out a sub for dinner. We rolled back to the trailhead and Mrs Young's pulled out all the goodies she had packed for us. I ate a cookie brownie and took a few snacks before saying goodbye and thanking her again. It was a great treat mid day!
After leaving Mrs Young's and Tim to drive back to the South shore, Two Clicks and I planned to hike another 16 miles to a shelter. This was a big task for the afternoon as it was already 2pm. The terrain appeared easy though and I turned on the jets and got to business. We passed beautiful lakes and ponds and through some remarkable forest. I have only hiked two small sections of the MA AT but man, these less popular sections are amazing!
By the time I arrived at the shelter I was winded and tired. A big day, mile wise, along with an hour break to canoe and roughly 2 hours in town. I'd say we made the best of the day and weather but I know tomorrow will be shorter as we ascend Greylock.","

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593984,"Real feel of 27.5 because of my stupid mistake. After almost 1600 miles, I finally left my GPS at the shelter I stayed at last night. It was bound to happen once but man I was hoping it never would. I set my GPS out on the ground typically where it can view the sky and send out the signal in the morning letting my family, a few friends and Abby know I'm up and where I'm starting. Well, I totally forgot I set it there and hiked 2.5 miles down to the road at Dalton, MA. I cursed like a sailor for a solid minute and really contemplated my options. Leave it, hope someone coming north from the shelter would bring it or haul my ass up the mountain to get it. It was a nice day and I was feeling alright so I became a SOBO hiker for a bit heading towards the shelter. This is where my trail running shoes came in clutch. I was hauling and had left my pack down at the bottom. Luckily, I had made it only about 2 miles and met up with a Flip Flopper named Bear Chaser. He had grabbed it and was heading downhill when I met him. I thanked him so much and told him I'd pay him back! I turned around and headed back down hill into Dalton for some breakfast and a quick resupply. A 4 mile mistake!
In town I got just a few things at a gas station for resupply then headed to Juice and Java for breakfast. Us hiker trash hung outside and I drank an iced coffee, breakfast sandwich, a Gatorade and two donuts. I treated Bear Chaser to breakfast for his help this morning and we enjoyed the warm sun for the morning.
I then hiked out of Dalton and into Cheshire, MA after a 6ish mile up and down on a ridge. In Cheshire, we walked through town again and by this time it was noon! Of course I had to get more town food! Right on trail there was a shack that sold food. I sat with other hikers named Hawk and Head Over Heels as I devoured a chocolate milkshake, a few chili hot dogs and another Gatorade. Full enough to turn calories into miles on the long climb up Mt Greylock. I left here around 1230 and started the climb. We ascend Greylock for roughly 8 miles. A slow, fairly gradual climb that eventually reaches the top. I had done this hike before but in the winter and only on a tiny portion of the AT so it was great being up here now!
Unfortunately, the restaurant on top was closed! No famous Greylock Egss Benedict for me! I guess I can't be greedy because I had eaten twice in town but it was a bit of a bummer. The views were great here though and the top was full of people who had mainly driven up. I was still able to fill my water and get some awesome views before hitting the trail again to descend just a bit to the shelter for the night. Roughly 3 miles down hill I got here and it was eerie. There were 4 tents set up but nobody here! Multiple hikers had commented in the shelter book that they were there a few days ago too. I joked with Two Clicks that they were full of dead bodies so eventually I had to check. I announced multiple times to see if anyone answered but no voices-- so I opened one. Nobody in them and no dead bodies but there was some gear in them! Creepy to be honest but I zipped it back up and walked away. Hopefully we don't have any issues with the mystery owners!
7 miles from the border of VT and excited to hike the Green Mountains which ive never done!

P.S: Thanks for following Hank! Hope this gives some insight into the hike but should you have more questions feel free to email me at philipsheehy217@yahoo.com. Good luck in your prep for the hike next year!","Kay Wood Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594110,"More and more I think of this hike as a walk from food spot to food spot. Two Clicks and I woke up and headed down the remainder of Greylock towards North Adams, MA. When the trail walks through a town, how can you avoid trying to find a place to eat?? Well we did! I got into town first and while waiting for Two Clicks (Two Clicks and I don't hike together very often by the way. Many people assumed we did but we typically only hike together when there are landmarks like a state line or when we're headed into town. Otherwise we meet for lunch typically and then see each other at camp at night.) I was talking to a local. When Two Clicks got there I had gotten the inside scoop from the local named Steve who recommended Stop and Shop down the road. We walked the quarter mile away and each got a drink, two donuts and, yes mom!, a cup of fruit. It was a good start to the day!
While eating at the grocery store I had turned on my phone. Low and behold, Mike Tryon had texted me. He told me that he had phoned a friend in nearby Florida, MA who he had deliver some trail magic to the trail. They had hung it on the back of a sign in town. Two Clicks and I, stuffed with food, went and found it! It had 6 donuts, 2 honey buns and 2 packs of trail mix. Awesome! Thanks Mike and friends! We devoured the donuts then saved the other snacks for later. I just wish I had turned my phone on sooner!
We hiked up out of North Adams and when we hit the VT border, we officially hit the Long Trail. The Long Trail through Vermont is the first of its kind and the place in which Benton Mackaye got the inspiration for the AT while standing on top of Stratton Mountain. Being the original long trail, it too has white blazes that mark it's path. Therefore, when the AT- marked with white blazes- joins it they become one trail for approximately 105 miles up into VT. There, the AT veers East towards NH while the Long Trail continues north to Canada. When they split, both trails are still marked with white blazes so we have to be careful to make sure we take the right Trail! At the border of VT we therefore began hiking the LT and AT over a few mellow climbs throughout the day. I can see why they call it Vermud! There was a ton of mud around. A mudders paradise!
Shortly after the border we also hit the 1600 mile mark. There was no sign or anything. A slightly ambiguous milestone that we all know we passed but don't really care! We know we're getting closer. The remainder of the day we hiked in the moderate temperatures as rain came on and off. I managed to get through all of MA in nice weather and I'm very grateful for that! Camp tonight was full with 5 thru hikers from Georgia and two flip floppers. We had gotten in early around 430 and had a nice relaxing night and got to bed early! Good, these mountains are tiring me out!
P.S: I apologise to those that may look for my journal daily. Through the mid Atlantic I was so close to bigger cities with good reception but now as I hike into more remote areas I have limited service. I'll continue to post them nightly if I can but some nights it won't happen. Sorry about that, but thanks for reading! ","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594234,"A crazy storm rolled in last night with thunder, lightning and wind. I was so thankful that I had gotten a spot in the shelter even if that meant cuddling with Two Clicks. The top bunk was big enough for two people to sleep on but man was it tight. Either way, I slept well! And long!
The wind continued to howl in the morning but managed to dry the rain that had fallen. It was definitely hard getting up and reminded me a lot of the beginning of my hike where it was cold and miserable outside. Once I got up though, I was feeling great and I had a wicked good day of hiking. The air was cool enough to keep me warm while hiking and kept pushing me to keep moving. Two Clicks and I had originally planned a 21 to a campsite with an 18 mile nearo the next day but only a few miles in I could tell I was feeling it today and texted him that I would push over Stratton for a 27 to make my nearo more enjoyable. I took 10 minute breaks at the first two shelters I passed and then a half hour lunch at the third. Something about this hiking makes me feel great.
VT trails have been awesome! Pine needles to soften the blow to your feet and enough rocks and roots to keep you focused. I was in my own world today and I'm not sure if it was my lack of looking at my phone, good long sleep or the double coffee I had at lunch but man I loved it today!
On top of Glastonbury mountain I climbed the fire tower which put me above treeline and in the depths of the howling wind. It was intense but gave me sweet views of the Green Mountains. As the day continued, the skies darkened up and by the time I had climbed Stratton Mountain, 23 miles in or so, there was fog covering the peak, wind blowing and temps of 46 degrees. I didn't climb that tower because of the lack of views and was happy with that choice as I descended the other side and didn't have mild hypothermia. Thermoregulation!!!!
Eventually I made it to the Stratton Pond Shelter and didn't have to pay because there was no caretaker here! I got a nice bottom bunk and felt great from my long day with two fairly large climbs. Two Clicks had gotten my messages and pushed here too and we were both excited for food tomorrow once we hiked 11 miles to Manchester Center. Oh, and we met the girl Happy Feet who had left us trail magic back in MA. She is hiking north on the Long Trail and unfortunately got injured so had to slow down. Crazy coincidence!
P.S: The sketchy tents the other day ended up not being so sketchy. In the morning as I walked to the privy, a guy was exiting that hadn't been there that night. I imagine a few people in a group set up their tents then did a day hike of some sort. Creepy and very trusting but not murderous like we thought!","Melville Nauheim Shelter
",Stratton Pond Shelter,"Jun 14, Thu",27.80
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594348,"All night the rain pattered on the roof of the Shelter. I figured by the morning it would be done but as 5:30 came and the sun rose, the rain continued. It makes the mental challenge of getting up much harder.
I made it up and hit the trail shortly after rocking the poncho. The drive was a 10 mile day into town. A perfect Nearo! I cruised these miles and I hate to use the word but it was pretty much flat. Flat seems to be a fighting word on the trail.
The rain slowed, mist continued and mostly the water came dripping off the trees making it seem worse. It's funny-- the tree cover typically delays rain when it begins but extends it after it is over.
At the road into town, I waited a few minutes for Two Clicks. In the small amount of time, a guy came by twice asking if I needed a ride and both times I let him know I was waiting for Two Clicks. When we were both in the lot, another car drove up and offered us a ride in. No hitching needed! It was great.
In town, the woman named Dee gave us a quick tour then we hopped out and made our way to ""Up For Breakfast"" a popular diner in town. I'm not lying, this was THE BEST breakfast I've ever had. Sorry Hoaty's but they got you beat. I had two french toast, two pancakes, toast, 4 eggs, home fries, sausage and bacon with coffee. I really filled up. A hiker we met the other day rolled into the diner shortly before we left. His name was Mud Flap and he thru hiked the entire AT in 2013 and is now doing the Long Trail. He graciously paid for our breakfast and gave me a ton of insight into Paramedic school. He is a wicked nice guy!
After we thanked him and left, we killed time at the outfitter where I bought a new stove and pot-- both lighter and less bulky. We then made our way to Cilantros, a Mexican restaurant. Here we grabbed some local beers and hung out as Mud Flap and Journey joined us. They were both waiting for the bus to bring them to their cars parked along the trail.
At 1, Two Clicks and I walked to Price Chopper for resupply and then called the hostel for a ride. We got here and showered, did laundry then caught up on chores. Two Clicks and I played a game of checkers then I cooked Gandalf, Two Clicks and I a dinner of teriyaki chicken with rice and broccoli before the three of us and Hazmat ordered two large pizzas and had ice cream! What a day of eating! Tomorrow we'll be cooking breakfast here then headed back into the woods. We are 3/4 of the way through the trail and have 532 miles left! Woo!","Stratton Pond Shelter
",Manchester Center VT,"Jun 15, Fri",10.70
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594410,"We put in ""the matrix"" last night to watch but I couldn't stay awake very long for it. It seems I never really sleep well or long at hostels but I thoroughly enjoy them. I woke up at 5:30 and went downstairs to start cooking some eggs and pancakes in which Jeff, the hostel owner, provides. Instead, a hiker named Relentless we just met yesterday had already started cooking and had made omelettes! Score! I didn't have to cook so I grabbed an omelette and English muffin to eat along with coffee. I followed that up with some cereal too.
By 6, Gandalf and Two Clicks had joined me downstairs and we relaxed and ate. It was nice not rushing. I packed my bag and got everything ready then sat on the couch until 7am which was our agreed upon departure time. We dropped a man off at the bus stop who had section hiked part of the Long Trail then headed to the AT. After saying goodbye to Jeff and thanking him for his wonderful hospitality and clean hostel, we made for the trail. We separated along trail at the paces we know we hiked and enjoyed the cool morning.
The first hike was up Bromley Mt, a familiar named ski resort although I've never skied it! The trail brought us right to the peak and it was cool to walk the slopes. The ski patrol building at the top is even kept open for hikers to use as a shelter if they please!
I climbed down the mountain then back up the other side to Jennings peak and Peru peak. It's nice being back in some serious mountain ranges with views and the smell of Christmas at the top.
After a few brief breaks, I stopped for lunch at the Big Branch Shelter right along a big river. I was alone here and it was nice to eat with the sound of the river in the background.
After lunch I pushed to Little Rock Pond which is a popular day hike for people in the area. As I got nearer, I saw a group of people on a big rock across the pond. With only 5 miles left in the day and my body feeling good I decided to hike a blue blazed trail roughly half a mile to the rocks. When I got there I met a group that told me to call them the the Izzy Tizzys. It was a family out for the day but that name seemed to be easier than naming them all. They immediately asked if I was hiking the AT and then asked a bunch of questions all while feeding me! They gave me their leftover sandwiches, an apple, a protein bar and some pretzels. They even gave me more when I mentioned hiking with Two Clicks which I then packed out for him for dinner! Thanks to the Izzy Tizzy family for your generous food and conversation! My ultimate plan of going on the blue blazed was to try and jump off the rock into the pond. I half hardedly passed it off as I ate the food they had given me and enjoyed the views! There will be more ponds! Putting it on the list of things to come back to-- little rock pond and Up for Breakfast in Manchester Center!
I made the last 5 miles to camp and was the only one here! I hung around eating and enjoying the peace then gave Two Clicks, Gandalf and Hazmat sandwiches that I had left from the pond. They were all grateful! We realized today just how close we are to Killington where the AT and LT split! Should be headed east to NH by Monday!
P.S: Hi Mrs Devlin! Thank you so much for the offer of hospitality. I'm shooting you a text!","Manchester Center VT
",Greenwall shelter,"Jun 16, Sat",24.60
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594491,"This morning was an early one. Another hiker that had showed up later last night had an alarm go off at 5am. He was up and in shelters,that means everyone else is too. I'd say this is one of the only things I don't love about shelters but their convenience usually supercedes that.
I was on trail by 6 and started up some big climbs. We did roughly 6500' of elevation gain today over the 23 miles according to Hazmat. A big day! We hiked over Bear Mountain, the third one on this trail, and up and down a bunch of other climbs eventually to the base of Killington. The profile for the mountain didn't look bad but it was an 8 mile climb in total.
Two Clicks and I hiked near each other a lot today and pushed up Killington. At the start of the climb, we hit the 500 mile to Katahdin sign! Less than 500! It was a tough climb especially after having hiked 20 miles already and by the top I was definitely feeling lethargic. What drove me up the mountain though was the restaurant on top. We had to take a 0.2 mile spur trail from the AT to the top and man was it steep! Eventually we made it on the last bits of energy we had and walked into the restaurant after soaking in the view. I've never skied Killington but would love to. It's also a huge Mecca for mountain biking which was cool to talk to a bunch of people headed down the mountain on their bikes!
Inside I got a brisket sandwich, fruit and a cookie then downed two switchback ipas and a long trail-- seemed fitting. I definitely got a buzz going and the food was delicious. Eventually Hazmat and Gandalf arrived and joined us before we took off from the peak around 4. We had 4.4 miles left which were mainly downhill. Being buzzed made this fun! And slightly treacherous-- sorry Mom. It was a quick few miles and we showed up to the shelter by 6 to find it empty! The shelter is at the 1700 mile mark! Crazy to think that! What a great day. We put good miles in and hung out in a restaurant for around 2 hours! We both agreed we'll definitely be doing this type of thing more often!","Greenwall shelter
",Churchill Scott shelter,"Jun 17, Sun",23.60
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594564,"Last night's forecast called for a 90% chance of rain with hot temperatures. That meant we wanted to get as many dry miles in as possible. It was huuuumid! The wind was blowing a bit though so it did help keep us from sweating too bad but throughout the day I got used to my shirt being beyond soaked.
The climb down Killington was easy and then we had a bit of ""flat"" along the edge of Kent Pond. Here is where we split off the Long Trail and headed east towards Hanover, NH. At Kent Pond there is a lodge that hosts weddings that the AT passes right by. Imagine hiking by as a wedding was going on!? Hiker trash photobomb! Two Clicks and I were both out of the groove today. We want to blame the humidity but who knows. It's like the male version of being on the same cycle. We seem to have matched up, for the most part, the days we feel good and the days we feel bad with a few exceptions.
At the lodge, we walked around. It was pretty deserted but we opened a few doors until we found someone who worked here. We had no idea if they sold food or beverage but we had to try! It was right on trail! He said he didn't have Gatorade but did have sodas! We both got one and he brought them out with a glass of ice to pour them into. Fancy! You could tell he never really had hikers stop here for this haha.
The sodas helped but the climbs today really kicked my ass. Sorry for the profanity but it really describes the situation. The climbs that are hyped up by everyone seem to be easier maybe because we're expecting difficulty. As for this section, My Quimby is tough! Maybe it was the humidity or lack of motivation but my legs were shaking afterwards and Two Clicks' were too. We stopped at the top to replenish our glycogen reserves as Hazmat would say.
Side note: Hazmat is a dad that's finishing the last section of the AT. We met him just after Greylock and have been hiking around him since. He is a chemist by trade and always makes reference to chemistry talk. Reminds me of Mr Nash! He's a really cool guy and will be finishing the AT on Mt Moosilauke in NH with his kids in a few days. He has a really cool setup where he cooks muffins on trail along with eggs with his pot! It's so cool to watch. He's too smart for me but seems to like us. He refers to Two Clicks and I as the old men because we go to bed so early.
Around 11 we stopped at a shelter for an early lunch. We had high hopes this would bring some energy back to us. A double dose of instant coffee cold brewed (just too lazy to heat it up) along with some food and my iPod after lunch really helped me push the last 10 miles of so. It's funny to think how many people reading this cringe when I say country music helped a lot haha.
I stopped 2 miles before camp to venture up a side trail to what was called ""the lookout."" It wasn't that great of a view but it was a cool climb to a deck on top of the roof of this hut. In the distance I could see what looked like a storm so I made the stop quick and kept moving.
Minutes from the shelter the sky began to darken. I had caught up to Two Clicks who passed when I took the side trail and we started moving quickly. With impeccable timing we reached the shelter as the heavy rain began! Perfect timing. We settled in as the shelter was already packed and claimed our spots. We then went down to get water in the rain which felt great after such a hot day. It was an early stop at camp around 3:30 but we had done good miles and today was tough. We may be altering our plans to stealth outside Hanover, NH tomorrow then officially cross the border Wednesday to give us enough time for a resupply and hanging out in town to eat! We shall see!
P.S: I finally switched audible books. Lord of the Rings just wasn't doing it for me anymore unfortunately. I'm not saying I didn't like it but I just wanted something different. I'm reading Stephen King's book ""The Stand"" which if I like it will definitely last me until Maine knowing the length of his books.","Churchill Scott shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594750,"Storms ripped through the area last night and absolutely dumped rain. All night there was rain, wind and lightning. I guess we got the same storm that some other towns in the area got that took out power and messed things up. It was intense. Lucky for us though, we didn't have to hike through it and stayed dry for the most part. It was all over by the morning.
I got up and headed out on trail not before having to change from my sleep clothes to my sweat covered, cold hiking clothes. That was no fun. As soon as I put them on and started hiking though they began to dry up. Doesn't mean I smell good though!
The weather today was cooler with nice winds and clouds giving in and out sunshine. It was a beautiful day for hiking. The start of the day was what I would consider a roller coaster. Constant small ups and downs that would rival the roller coaster section in VA. Two Clicks and I had hoped to stop at the Cloudland Market for a pick me up drink or something but after pushing hard across the roller coaster, we found out it was closed. That was a let down. Pushing on though, we happened upon some trail magic of sodas next to a river and took full advantage of that!
Before noon we stopped together at a shelter for an early lunch and coffee break. That helped power us through the day. I took a few stops at some lookouts and sat on an awesome bench looking off to the east. The bench said ""VT Relax and Enjoy"" so I followed orders and did so with a chance to air out my feet. We had been praying for more open terrain and fields and we sure got it! That meant getting our feet soaked though in the over hanging grasses soaked from last night's storm.
Eventually we made it into West Hartford, VT where we walk through town. A nice couple with a house right on trail invited us to their porch for sodas and muffins! Yet another great boost before our last climb over to the NH border!
We climbed up Happy Hill which was actually not a bad climb but I was happy it was over. Punny! From here we descended into Norwich, VT.
After Two Clicks and I met back up at the road walk we began the stroll through town. Multiple houses along the road had trail magic! Sodas and fresh bread! What a day for surprises! In town we went off trail just a bit and resupplied before going next door for beers at the brewery! Its been nice drinking local beers along the trail. You could probably consider this a giant bar crawl. Or maybe a food crawl for me!
We loaded up with a small buzz due to the fact we hadn't eaten anything and walked across the border into NH. I was so pumped! It's amazing to me thinking I walked from GA to NH and have under 500 miles left. That's still a ton and, yes, I still need to focus but I can be excited!
After our border pictures, we walked into Hanover. I've never been to this part of NH but it's nice! Reminds me a lot of Portsmouth for sure. It's funny the contrast between rich, high class Dartmouth students and families to the hiker trash that walk through town. I think this experience has humbled me in the fact that I can see through both lenses. Having had the opportunity to go to college as well as being homeless with money. Hopefully it'll make me a more kind, understanding and more well rounded human.
We stopped at Domino's for a large pizza each and both wolfed them down inside the shop while joking around with the worker there. He was impressed with us both downing our pizzas! Now it was time to find a place to stay. We ended up talking to another hiker named Hawk who told us of stealth spots past Dartmouth college in the woods. We walked back into what I like to call ""Appalachian Trail land"" and found a bunch of tent spots just past the softball field in the woods! It was amazing and really pushed the point home of being homeless with the ability to set up 'home' anywhere we want along trail. We paid nothing to sleep at Dartmouth College with a great view of the fields! 
After setting up our tents we walked to the college Co-Op and got a few beers and a drink. We made it right before it closed at 8 then brought back our drinks to the woods to sip on them. Both of us had a cigar as well to celebrate NH! My once a year $2 gas station cigar haha. We sat on some rocks overlooking the fields as the sun went down. It hadn't really sunk in that we were in NH for either of us because we had yet to venture into a place we knew or get hit by the rugged mountains ahead. Onto the whites we go though! Thanks to VT for being so beautiful and such a nice change of pace.","Wintturi Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594826,"We woke up in our tents to the typical sound of a bustling city. After tearing down camp, we hiked back into Hanover for breakfast. On the way into town we ran into Hazmat headed for the trail. He was pushing a big day so that he can meet his son Friday and finish his last section of the trail! We got his real name (crazy!) And friended him on Facebook so we could see his pictures then said goodbye. We had a huge breakfast at Lou's where they give hikers a free doughnut! After sitting for an hour we made our way next door to Starbucks where we got coffees and hung around charging our phones up. This gave me the chance to catch up on journaling which was put to the side when we were homeless yesterday and stoked to be in NH.
Around 11 we went to Armunto's pizza for a free slice they offer to thru hikers then back to the Co Op for a few things before hitting the trail ourselves. We split up to hike the mileage at our own pace and enjoyed the serenity of the woods. Welcome to NH I said as the climbs got steep enough that the Dartmouth Outing Club, who maintain this section, had put a rope in for the steepness of the climb. I think it finally hit me that I was in NH about an hour in. I just laughed out loud to myself thinking about how crazy that was.
I got to the top of Moose Mountain, really the only big climb of the day and hung out on top for a half hour enjoying the quiet breeze, overcast skies and perfect temperatures as I looked at the view that I believe faced south east. It was a nice day and I finished off the hike with 0.8 down hill to the shelter where I was determined to lessen the weight of my food bag and enjoy the night.
At the shelter someone had brought a container of nips, chocolate and Advil! Two clicks and I took a celebratory shot when we got there. Then another hiker named Hot Sauce showed up and was determined to make a fire. As Two Clicks and I helped him grab some wood he started it then we all sat around eating and staring into the fire. Soon after, other hikers showed up named Grits and Treeline. It was a really relaxing night and a great Nearo. The water source here was terrible though so I'm hoping my filter works! Still puddles kind of scare me but that's what my filters made for! We shall see in the morning!","The woods past Dartmouth college

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594937,"Well, despite my body telling me no, and my mind agreeing-- I woke up at 4am with Two Clicks for sunrise. We woke up and were on trail by 4:30. He was a bit ahead because, well, I took longer to get greased up for the big days hike. As much as I don't look forward to hiking in the dark, it does bring out a whole new image to the forest. The birds hadn't started chirping yet and daybreak was just setting in. It was super peaceful!
We hiked the 1.6 miles by 5 for what we were told was a 5:03 sunrise. From the small Vista just below the north peak of Moose Mountain, we sat drinking coffee in the warm weather with a nice breeze. First day of summer, which also happens to be ""hike naked day"" was kicked off with a bang. No I did not partake in hiking naked, I did however take part in the first day of summer.
After the sun rose, we had eaten breakfast and packed back up, it was on the trail again! The first climb for the day was Holt's Ledges. They were amazing views up towards Smarts Mountain. Down the other side we started the ascent up Smarts Mountain. All I could think about was ""this is Holly Smart's mountain!"" So here's to your mountain Holly! It had a fire tower on top and great views! We were in and out of a cloud so it was definitely chillier than most peaks. Even on this beautiful day! Also, who knew there was a Dorchester, NH? I didn't and we passed a road leading into it!
On Smart's mountain, Two Clicks and I met up and descended together. There was a ton of moose poo on the way down and we were hoping to see one but no luck! We stopped at the bottom for lunch along a river. I'll call it butterfly river because there were butterflies everywhere! They were basking in the sun and flying all around. It made for a very peaceful lunch spot.
Next came the last ""big"" climb of the day up Mt Cube at just under 3000'. We had a lot of climbing today and probably bit off more mileage than we should have but it's worth it to get to the base of Mt Moosilauke for tomorrow's nice weather. Mt Cube, like the last two, had amazing views and the sun was so warm on top. I sat up here for at least a half hour and made a call to my mom. Back in Virginia, one of the hostels named Stanimals had a sign that said ""call your mom."" I think that's important! After our chat, I took pictures for Two Clicks as he yoyoed haha and then we descended the cube seeing our first southbounder of the trail!
The campsite tonight had no good water source so we packed 3 liters up. 6 pounds of water plus food and other gear gets heavy and we had the smallest climb of the day (still 1000' gain!) Up Ore ""hill."" This hill would be a mountain in the south. No offense south! But it was easily doable and we made it to camp by 4. 11.5 hours on the trail to do 25 miles. Not bad for the terrain today but mileage will be cranking back for sure.
We ate dinner, dried some gear out then layed in our tents mosquito free listening to Stephen King and hanging out. These bugs have been bad lately and the black flies have gotten me good! 
P.S: I feel like I was mildly bitter towards Hanover/Dartmouth in my journal. I have to say, it was an awesome town! We had two people walk by and literally give us candy/protein bars for being hikers and another guy yelled ""nice job guys!"" Out the window of his car as we walked by. A very friendly town for sure just lacking a solid outfitter and some smaller amenities like affordable hostels. Other than that I really enjoyed the town and thank Dartmouth Outing Club for their trail maintenance! Everytime I see their DOC symbol, though, I think ""Department of Corrections"" especially with the orange signs they use but I digress!","Moose Mountain Shelter

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595033,"It got pretty cold last night making it a mental battle to get up but we were both on trail around 6:30. We had to climb up and over Ore Hill to NH 25 which was easy. At the trailhead here, someone had left a bag of food. There was a Gatorade and some beef jerky. I thought it was trail magic as it didn't appear to be labeled and so I began drinking the Gatorade. All of a sudden I looked down at the bag and in faint letters it read ""Two Clicks."" I felt so bad! I had only drank half the Gatorade so I left the other half and waited to confess to him. When he got there, I said ""sorry"" then explained the situation. We both laughed it off but I owe him a Gatorade.
 At this road, we remembered something a fellow hiker mentioned about a hostel just off trail. We looked it up and sure enough the hostel named ""Hikers Welcome"" was 0.3 from us. We had to stop! Here, we each ate a bunch. I had two breakfast sandwiches, a mini pizza, a mountain dew and an iced tea. It was nice to eat a bunch before the climb up Mt Moosilauke.
After our half hour break we began the climb. It was tough but nothing the both of us haven't done before and eventually we reached the top. This is the same summit I had climbed last St Patrick's day and skied down. The one my mom, girlfriend and sister were so worried about me they called NH Fish and Game to check for me and my friend Sean. Haha good times... What a great summit and a spectacular view on this blue sky day with little to no wind. We had run into Hazmat, our section hiker friend on the way up. The peak of Moosilauke was the last section for him and when he got up there we held our trekking poles in an arch for him to walk under ceremoniously. He was super thrilled and hugged us both. He even got to share the moment with his daughter. It was really cool to share that moment with him because we thought we wouldn't. He's an awesome guy and he achieved such an awesome goal! Great Job Hazmat! Go Celebrate!
We parted ways with him and descended Moosilauke. The descent is crazy steep on the AT as it follows along a waterfall. We passed the shelter we had planned to stop at by 2 pm and decided to push on feeling good. At the base of the mountain in Kinsman Notch, we loaded up on 3L of water to ascend towards Mt Wolf which had no water until the north side. Our plan was to water carry and find some tenting spots.
Another hour went by and we made it to Gordon Pond just off the AT. There were some beautiful sites along the pond with great views. We set up for the night feeling happy with our 19.9 mile day of 5500' in elevation gain (3000' of that on the ascent up Moosilauke). It was a great day and we enjoyed eating a majority of our remaining food as we sat by the pond on the perfect eating rock under blue skies. Two Clicks and I are headed into Lincoln tomorrow from Franconia Notch to resupply, eat well and stay in a hostel while meeting my friend Max Janik. Today really felt like we were back home in the mountains we know so well and love hiking!","Ore Hill Campsites

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595121,"I woke up to the holler from Two Clicks like in boot camp. ""Get up, get up! Homebound get up!"" Damn, not another bear! Nope, it was 5am and I was laying all warm in my sleeping bag before jumping out of my tent in my underwear and T-shirt (my personal version of hike naked day). Two Clicks had woken up and heard something in the pond and looked. It was a moose! Majestic!! We had been joking about seeing one after noticing so much scat on the trail. Here, at 5am was a moose strolling around the pond with the sky a beat orange lit up behind it. It was absolutely amazing. I stood watching this creature for 10-15 minutes standing in my underwear freezing. Well worth it and honestly a great way to start the day.
Well, we were both up so we packed slowly and were thankful the rain had held off so far. By 6 we found our way back to the trail and were ascending Wolf Mt. It had some great views under the overcast skies and it really was beautiful. I decended as Two Clicks hung out longer at the top.
At the bottom of the Kinsman Ridge trail we passed Eliza Brook Shelter then followed Eliza Brook up the ascent of South Kinsman. I've hiked the Kinsmans but never from this side and it was rugged! A fun climb for sure and soon enough I was at the top.
After admiring the views I set off to avoid getting too cold in my t-shirt and headed for the north peak before climbing down the Fishin Jimmy Trail to the Lonesome Lake Hut. I walked in with hopes of buying a cookie brownie that are infamous at the huts! I gave my money and devoured one. The croo saw me eating and the cook for the day asked if I wanted any chicken. Yes! I devoured 5 pieces and Two Clicks joined me when he arrived. They claimed they needed to get rid of it and I was grateful to eat something of substance. Thanks to the croo member Eddie!
We descended from Lonesome Lake via the Cascade Brook Trail and crossed under I-93! That was exciting based on the amount of times I've driven it for hikes! On the other side we got to the Liberty Springs Trail up to Franconia Ridge and walked to Rt 3 where we ended up getting a hitch into Lincoln. The guy was great and literally risked his life to pick us up! We immediately took care of business in the outfitter before meeting up with my friend Max Janik.
Max drove up with some supplies and things from home and we got lunch at the brewery in town. His mom, Cindy Janik ended up giving him money to pay for our meal so thank you Cindy! We ate and had a few beers before resupplying at Price chopper then making our way to North Woodstock. After hanging with Max for a few hours we got to the Notch Hostel and settled in after saying goodbye to him. He is starting a sweet job in NYC in early July. Good Luck Max!
At the hostel we did our normal thing and hung out catching up on journaling, showering and doing laundry. It had come to a point where our clothes were causing bad irritation due to the salt from our sweat. This was a great stop and we managed to miss the afternoon rain as it began to come down outside. Up Franconia Ridge tomorrow!

P.S: Mom, it's so great to be back! Strange hiking some of the same mountains just from different angles and from a different perspective. I haven't seen Happy Feet yet to ask about the Franconia Playground haha but I'll try! Moosilauke is a lot different without snow and skis on my pack. Just heard today from Max that NH Fish and Game is attempting to hire a bunch of people so I'll definitely be applying after I finish!","
",The Notch Hostel,"Jun 23, Sat",13
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595480,"We woke up to fog in morning as we milled about the hostel eating some food and waiting for our shuttle ride to Franconia Notch. Justin, who works at the Notch Hostel, drove us up around 7:30 and we were headed up the Liberty Springs Trail. I had only come down this trail before so, again, I got to see the trail in a new perspective.
The hike up to Franconia ridge was in some fog and full humidity. Driving towards the range we thought the sun might burn off the fog but we were wrong. We huffed it up to the ridge and were completely socked in. I was grateful, however, that it was not raining! We headed over Little Haystack then Lincoln before running into a man on the ridge. He was one of Two Clicks followers on Instagram who had hiked up to meet him. His name was Gandalf and he had thru hiked in 2016. We sat atop The ridgeline, only able to see 50' in front of us and he pulled out beers from his bag! How could you say no!? We sat around chatting for close to an hour in the miserable weather completely exposed. We laughed about the trail but eventually the cold and the booze was draining me and I was shivering! After two beers we parted ways as he headed south and we pointed north simply to get warm. Thanks Gandalf for the trail magic!
I hiked on over Lafayette on this viewless day then started the descent to Garfield Pond from the ridge. As I did this, another man who was pulled off the side of the trail asked if I knew Two Clicks. I told him how we had hiked roughly 1500 miles together and he offered me a beer too! Holy crap. I was so tired and cold already that I had to turn it down. Remember when I said ""how could you turn down a beer?"" Yeah I did that. But thanks for the offer Woody!
On the summit of Garfield I ate and drank some substance in hopes of gaining back some energy. I made a few phone calls too without knowing this would be the only service I had for the next day and a half. Once Two Clicks got up there we laughed about him being famous on Instagram. I'm just the squid who happens to travel with him and take a lot of pictures of him haha.
At the Galehead Hut, Two Clicks and I scored a work for stay in the crappy weather. Essentially, the huts allow thru hikers to sleep on the ground in the dining room of the AMC huts and eat dinner and breakfast leftovers in exchange for a bit of work. Well we really scored here and ended up only doing a tiny bit of work. I cleaned some drawers at night and swept the dining room in the morning. Two Clicks folded blankets in the morning. In exchange, we ate stuffed shells, salad, soup and dessert with those who were staying the night. It was a sweet gig! Thanks to Jake (Shaggy) and Thacher the two hut croo who were there with us.
While at the hut, we were also treated to a talk by a naturalist named Anne who talked a lot about wilderness with us. She did a talk at night then we had multiple conversations with her regarding birds, like the yellow throated sparrow in the area and the Pemi Wilderness in which the Galehead Hut borders. Thanks Anne! It was a great night and we were happy to be inside out of the rain and winds.

P.S: Sorry for the delay in posts! I've had little to no phone service these past few days and no chance at wifi or 4G! I suppose it makes the experience more real! Thanks for everyone's concern","The Notch Hostel
",Galehead Hut,"Jun 24, Sun",13
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595481,"Work for stay in the morning consisted of sweeping and preparing the bunkrooms after we were treated to eggs, bacon, coffee, pancakes and bread. Again, such a nice meal!
After a late start around 9 when we finished our work, we climbed up South Twin mountain. Another 4000' mountain which are fun to do again and bring back memories of the first time I did them. As we neared the top while hiking in the fog and mist,the sun came out for a quick minute with hopes of it burning off the fog.
We hiked from here to the next hut on the AT which happened to be Zealand hut. Here, the croo gave us the leftovers from dinner last night. More stuffed shells! It was a nice lunch! The croo often give leftovers to us because if they don't, they have to do more work composting the food. So, as thru hikers they get really excited to give us food! It's amazing!
On the way down from Zealand, I took a dive. I was hooking up my iPod and not paying enough attention to the wet rocks. I pretty much dove as my foot slipped and ended up landing on my right hip and scraping both knees and badly scraping my arm. It hurt like hell. I learned my lesson though and after a minute, I got up and walked it off. The mountains don't care.
I hiked past Ethan Pond Campsite and eventually down to Rt 302 Crawford Notch. The entire time I was in minor pain from my hip but I ended up popping Ibuprofen, which I try to avoid, and it worked it's miracles.
My friend Mike Tryon had hoped to hike Washington with us the next day and was going to meet us at Crawford Notch where we had originally planned to stay. Well, it's so difficult to plan anything and when we hit Crawford Notch at 2pm we knew we had to keep pushing. I didn't have service so I couldn't contact him so I was hoping he would see my GPS tracks. We began the climb up the Webster Cliff Trail over the cliffs to Mt Webster and Mt Jackson. There were sweet views of the entire state and the winds were high. The gusts were probably 40-50mph! It was exciting. At the cliffs I finally got service and Mike decided he was going to follow right behind us and meet us at the Mizpah hut where we were headed-- 6 miles from 302.
At the Mizpah hut, Two Clicks got a work for stay and I went to the Nauman Campsite right next to the hut and paid for a spot for myself and Mike when he showed up. I did my chores and ate a quick dinner before the cold took over. It was cold! Cold enough where I slept with my water filter and was wearing most of my layers. I was happy I had switched back to my 3 degree sleeping bag for the whites even though it weighs more! I believe it dropped down to low 30s if not lower at night.
Mike arrived around 8:30 and relieved my stress. That trail was hard and I was worried about him hiking alone potentially into the dark. The only thing was I had no way to contact him and was just hoping he would make it. When he got there I forced him to stop setting up his tent and change out of his sweaty clothes in order to stay warm. While he did so, I helped set up his tent. Tent platforms suck! I talked him out of cooking food so late and he ate a few bars before jumping in his sleeping bag to stay warm. We went to bed with hopes for great weather tomorrow over Washington!","Galehead Hut
",Nauman Campsite,"Jun 25, Mon",21.10
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595482,"It was cold this morning and instead of having Two Clicks tenting next to me I had Mike. It was a strange feeling! I was the one to initiate the mattress deflation! When I did, Mike got up too and we got ready for the day. By 645 we were up and we met up with Two Clicks. He wasn't so lucky last night and ended up doing 2 hours worth of work at the hut washing dishes. I felt bad but was secretly happy I didn't do work for stay haha. He was also at the mercy of the guests and didn't get to fall asleep until after 930 when the guests went to bed themselves. There are definitely pros and cons.
We started up the southern presidentials and enjoyed their ease before getting to the base of Washington. It was cool having someone hike with us and Mike is a strong hiker for sure. The winds were very strong this morning but ended up mellowing out in the afternoon.
We climbed Mt Washington and were honored to be with Mike as he climbed his first 4000', 5000' and 6000' mountains! Two Clicks and I summited a bit before him as we had hoped to do so together. We ran to touch the sign and luckily there was no line of tourists so we got pictures pretty easily. There were plenty of questions from the tourists up here though.
When Mike summited, I took pictures at the sign with him then we ran into the food court to eat. I had a piece of pizza, hotdog and root beer bought by Mike then had a very nice woman buy me a slice of pizza as well. We ate a lot and enjoyed the top before departing with Mike. He was going to head back down to the Lake of The Clouds Hut where we had stopped for a break earlier and eaten some food. From there he was going to take the Amanoosuc Ravine Trail to the base of the Cog Railway and either call a shuttle ride or attempt to hitch back to his car at Crawford Notch. A mini adventure for him!
Two Clicks and I pushed on towards the Northern Presidentials. More rocks and many more hikers to maneuver around but eventually we made it to Madison Springs Hut. Beforehand, we even saw snow on the trail! The hut croo gave us leftover baked goods and fruit as we rested our legs and feet. After the break, we pushed over the summit of Mt Madison then down the Osgood trail towards Rt 16 and Pinkham Notch. We were beat and the sun definitely drained us by the end but super happy to have hit the Presidential's on a great day! Only a sunburn to note!
About 2 miles from rt 16, we stopped at the Osgood Tentsite super happy with the day and timing we've had through the whites so far. We ate early and got into tents early too for well needed rest. I finally was able to write my journals for the first time in three days! Tomorrow we will essentially do a nearo to Carter Notch Hut where Two Clicks' follower bought us both a legit stay at the hut. We can chill by the pond! After that, Thursday will put us into and possibly past Gorham then Saturday a zero with Abby after I cross into Maine. Crazy!","Nauman Campsite
",Osgood Campsite,"Jun 26, Tue",14.90
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595552,"This morning we knew we had a short day and took it fairly easy. It was a four mile hike to Pinkham Notch and food! Pinkham sits on RT 16 which was cool to cross! At the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, I walked in and plugged in my phone as I paid $13 for all you can eat breakfast! The southbounders we met outside were unwilling to pay that money for breakfast but at this point I will pay anything for good food. They'll get to that point!
We ate multiple plates each and hung around the center for a bit before moving on. It's funny how the outlets we can use are usually situated next to the little kids drawing table. Two Clicks and I were sitting on these tiny little chairs catching up on things with the wifi they gave us!
The climb up from RT 16 brings you up the Wildcats. I've done this before and know how steep it is but it was rough once again. It went by fairly quickly though and I was up at the ski lifts in no time.
After crossing over the multiple wildcat peaks (A-E) I began the descent to Carter Notch Hut. Right before then, I ran into two day hikers named Carole and Scott who gave me a banana! Thanks guys! It was a beautiful day for hiking.
After the steep descent to the hut, I walked in and asked the hut croo chef for the day if I could use a pool floaty I had seen on the shore of the pond. She said it was another croo members so I instead asked if swimming was allowed. Cheerfully she said, yes! And then she asked if I could bring the floaty back to a secret alcove where they had all their croo equipment. I happily agreed and by the time I had gotten in the water and on the floaty, Two Clicks was coming down the trail. I sat on the floaty in the middle of the pond as he hiked the trail around it. We both laughed at the awesomeness of this.
Once I got the floaty back, I swam across the pond back to my stuff and dried off. It was chilly but refreshing and made me smell at least a bit better! Two clicks had dropped his stuff and did the same. For the rest of the afternoon, we hung around the hut talking with the croo, playing some board games and eating. We walked over to a place called the ramparts where there are a bunch of rocks with views of the notch. We also called ahead to a hostel in Gorham where we are going to head to tomorrow. The weather forecast for the day called for buckets of rain so we were going to wimp out and stay there tomorrow. One more big climb up Carters and Moriah tomorrow then we are really close to crossing into Maine.
I want to thank Virginia Harrington, one of Two Clicks' Instagram followers, for reserving spots for us at Carter Notch Hut. These hut stays are not cheap and Virginia went out of her way to purchase them for us after following Two Clicks and seeing his AT hike posts. I'm just the lucky squid who happened to be able to tag along. Thank you so much Virginia, this was an amazing opportunity!

P.S: Hi David! It's been a crazy transition from Lord of the Rings to Stephen King but so far it's been great. We sat in the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center today and I got sketched out at all the people coughing after reading only a bit of the book. Looking forward to the rest.

Hey Mark! Thanks again for the beers and conversation. Two Clicks and I were just talking about how cool that was once again. Hope to see you in the Whites again!","Osgood Campsite

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595642,"Waking up in a bunk at the hut was amazing. Thanks again to Patricia for such a wonderful treat! We packed up and made our way over to the kitchen where we sat down and drank coffee before breakfast. The food came out at 7 and the croo fed us while doing their skits. We ate eggs, sausage, oatmeal and cornbread. It's been a really cool experience staying in the huts as a guest and work for stay. The whites treated me well and man did I eat good!
We suited up for the rain outside and prepared for an entire day of soaking rain that the forecast had called for. The climb out from the hut was straight up to Carter Dome. I've done this descent in the winter and knew it was going to be bad. I preferred going up it for sure! The rain pattered my poncho pretty much all morning. It was mostly light but at times got heavy. As I gained elevation I got more of the wind too. It could have been worse though and honestly I was expecting it to be bad but it ended up being an okay day.
We passed over Carter Dome, Mt Height, North middle and south Carter then over Mt Moriah. Most of these mountains are 4000 footers. The downhill was slow but uphill went a bit quicker. I was poised to not fall on the wet, slippery rocks and managed to only take two minor tumbles with a few saves. Two Clicks on the other hand took many falls and I could hear him swearing when he did. I can wholeheartedly relate but I took my time and made it a priority to not injure myself today. Back to falling tomorrow!
We eventually made it to Rt 2 which leads into Gorham. I had called yesterday to stay in a hostel and was glad I had. It was a reunion of thru hikers we knew and it was really fun! A lot of southbounders too so the place was packed. We got some of the last beds and honestly would have slept on the floor but got lucky.
We showered and put our clothes in for laundry before jumping on a shuttle headed to pick up some hikers at Walmart. They had to drive right through Gorham so on the way we had the hostel owner drop us off at Saalt Pub in town. My coworker for a short 3 months as I helped out at Hampton Academy, Stacey Burlingame (or Mrs B as the kids called her) had messaged me the other day on Facebook. She wanted to provide Two Clicks and I with some trail magic. She offered to buy us a gift card to a restaurant we may hit soon and I noted this pub in Gorham. Well, Stacey being the amazing woman she is called the pub and got us a gift card. Our lunch/dinner meal on this cold, rainy day of hiking was bought by her. Thank you so much Stacey. Two Clicks and I really appreciate your generosity! After eating we got some Tuckermans beer to drink at the hostel then made ourselves at home as the rain came down. What great timing. It was relaxing being able to put up my feet, talk with some awesome hikers I hadn't seen in a few weeks and share our stories of the Whites. We got through them and just have one more state left. In this hostel I have exactly 298.3 miles left to Katahdin and its unbelievable. Thanks for following my journals so closely and as I enter Maine, don't worry if I don't post for a few days--- I probably don't have service!","Carter Notch Hut

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595725,"The morning at the hostel was relaxing and we had a cup of coffee with waffles that were free for anyone staying. Shortly after, we both set out for the trail. The climb in the beginning was nice then the trail became rugged. It seems like the trail in NH anywhere besides the Whites is much less traveled. At times I actually thought I was either on a different trail or had made a wrong turn and was completely off trail. I made it though!
Today was tough. The rain all day yesterday had made EVERYTHING slick. Rocks, roots, the roots on the rocks, bog Bridges and everything in between. It was slow going for sure. With Abby coming up after work tonight, I had begun to consider pushing the entire 31 miles to get there late tonight and be able to hang out with her for an extra night. The realization that that would be incredibly hard sunk in though and I stuck to the original plan. I climbed over two mountains then over the top of Mt Success-- a fitting name for the last peak in NH. I had completed my 13th state and it felt amazing. One more to go. I ate lunch at the border (on the NH side, sorry Maine) then pushed into vacationland. I could tell this was the way life should be. Get it? Mainers?
The peaks were amazing right off the bat and Goose Eye peak blew me away. It was exposed ridgline with bogs and everything. Really some beautiful climbing. Lots of technical footing and treacherous descents slowed me down though. I am happy to report I only fell a handful of times. Most were successful saves but one was a wipe out. No injuries!
As I peaked one of the Goose Eye mountains, I could see a thunderstorm off in the distance and heard the thunder. I pushed it over the exposed ridge with a pep in my step and was happy when I avoided it altogether! I outran the storm! Another rolled in as I neared the shelter and I had enough time to make it under the roof and collect water before the rain came! Just a small passing shower but I was happy to stay dry. All in all it was a great day and I'm happy to be in Maine and to see Abby tomorrow morning after I tackle the Mahoosuc Notch bright and early then the Speck Mountains.
P.S: Thank you Halfbak for the kind comment regarding my journal! I would have to say though I think Hungry Cat definitely has me beat but I appreciate the shout-out.
Mary and Uncle David-- I'll have to do a quick write up of the Fish and Game incident later on. It's funny to look back on now!

",Full Goose Shelter,"Jun 29, Fri",21.40
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595866,"I initiated the deflation of the air mattresses this morning around 530am. We tend to call that sound the ""devil's whisper"" because it's essentially the shelter alarm clock. I was just excited to see Abby and pumped to have some time off trail. I feel like the past week has been pretty relaxed in terms of mileage but those miles have torn me up. My last zero was in MA with Mike! 400 miles ago! Although the timing and mileage didn't work out for a full zero here, I was still planning two long nearos back to back that I suppose would make up for that.
Two Clicks and I hit the trail towards Mahoosuc Notch. It's noted as either the hardest or most fun mile of the entire trail and we were excited to find out which category it fell in for both of us. I wasn't in much of a talking mood so we pushed on in silence. Eventually we hit the sign for the ""notch trail"" and took a 90 degree turn downwards. I felt like I was at Disney World entering a ride. The temperature legitimately dropped at least 10 degrees and there was snow in some of the crevasses as we walked up towards a pile of boulders. I invite anyone unfamiliar with this section to look up some pictures. It's gnarly!
We collapsed our trekking poles and stored them on our packs. This boulder field would require hands and feet, poles were unnecessary. I lead the charge inward and man is Maine a crazy place. We hobbled through the boulder field at less than a mile an hour. Over some rocks and under others. At times, there were arrows pointing straight down into caves. The openings were at times, too small to wear your pack into so I would take it off and carefully push it through. It took strategy. Just as I thought we were nearing the end, I heard water and of course there was a brook running underneath the rocks. Of course, why wouldn't there be? Just like a Disney ride-- add more scenery and landscape. Now a fall would mean wet shoes as opposed to just landing. Thanks Maine haha.
We made it through and got our trekking poles out. No injuries to either of us but two clicks broke his hip belt strap in one of the caves and later broke his Sawyer water filter. Tough times. We ascended up to Speck Pond then Old Speck Mountain. The climbs in Maine, off the typical day hiker path, have been insane with metal ladders, sunken bog Bridges and really tough scrambles. It can get really old quick but I suppose the views are worth it. I just have a tough time the days that I know I'm headed into town but still have miles ahead and mountains to climb before I get there. On this climb I ran into a southbounder. He found out my name and said ""your mom reads my journal. She told me to say hi!"" Of course she does haha! My mom's pretty awesome. It was cool running into him!
On the descent from Old Speck Mountain, I ran into a married couple with their kid. Well, low and behold, it was a family I follow on Instagram. They are ""theadventurousfamily"" online and I only recognized them at the last minute as they were passing. They are from NH and post beautiful pictures from their hikes so we chatted for a few minutes. Crazy the power of social media.
At the bottom of the mountain I ran into the parking lot as Abby walked towards the trailhead. I dropped my pack and we hugged for a while. Realistically it had only been a month since we last saw each other but it felt long! She gave me Gatorade and a Dunkin Donuts breakfast sandwich then we did some trail magic for a bit while Two Clicks showed up. The rest we left next to the trash can so hikers could throw out their trash. We would check it in the morning and take anything extra away.
We drove into Bethel and hit up the Sunday River Brewery for lunch. Then we got to the hotel and completed a few chores before hanging out watching TV. Exactly what I crave! We ate my mom's whoopie pies, ordered pizza and drank a few Baxter Brew beers. I told Abby to try and pick up local Maine IPAs to continue the beer tour and they were good! It was a great relaxing afternoon and will be a nice morning too before heading back out.

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595958,"The morning in the hotel was amazing. I ""slept in"" then Abby and I eventually met up with Two Clicks around 1030 and headed to the diner in town. We had a late breakfast then resupplied at the dollar store next door before grabbing a couple of smaller things at Rite Aid. A very relaxing morning.
We drove back to the trailhead and by 1pm I was back on trail. I said goodbye to Abby which was much easier to do knowing I had just over 200 miles left and was in the last state. She drove home as I began the climb up Baldplate mountain. It was hot! With the humidity and heat came bugs too. The entire climb up I was swarmed with mosquitos and black flies. Not glamorous at all! I was legitimately dripping sweat with a cloud of bugs around me. I could have jumped in a pool and been drier than I was now. This is the unfortunate reality of the trail.
Once up on top I took a quick break. The only reason I cut it short was the bug situation. I was hoping for a breeze and cooler temps up top to keep them away but that didn't happen. I pushed on to the second peak across an exposed ridge which was nice then descended to the Lean-to we had planned to stay at (in Maine they call shelters Lean-tos). I got here at 4 and was immediately degraded by another thru hiker. He told me my deet bug spray was bad for me then said I looked too clean shaven to have come from Georgia. I held my tongue in responding to him and decided to move on. I had been in a good mood until then. I'll leave names out of it but at this point in the trail nobody needs this kind of negativity or drama.
I pushed another 4 miles and got to a stream and waterfall around 5. Just a tiny bit down a blue blazed trail I found a nice tenting spot big enough for two tents in case Two Clicks pushed on too. I had left a note in sticks and texted him too letting him know where I was headed. Around 530 he ended up showing up too. We enjoyed our food (first day out of town we can eat a ton) then drank some bota wine boxes we had packed out for the night. We layered up to avoid the bugs but sweat instantly just sitting around. With that lack of comfort we ended up retiring to our tents fairly early to avoid the bugs and listen to our books. Listening to Stephen King in Maine! Fitting!
Thanks to Abby for driving to Maine and treating Two Clicks and I to a wonderful double Nearo. Probably one of the last breaks we'll have of trail and it was nice seeing her after a month. Also thanks to my mom for baked goods and Mr and Mrs Young's for buying us lunch the other day! Katahdin is getting so close!
P.S: In NH the huts work to reduce food waste. They tell guests to take what they can eat and eat what they take in order to be a part of ""the clean plate club."" Well, for a while, I have always joked about getting the clean plate award at dinners with family and friends as I use bread to wipe my plate clean. I always got laughed at for it until I ventured into the huts! There, I was absolutely a member of the clean plate club-- a club that actually exists!!!!!","Grafton Notch (Bethel, ME)

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596051,"An early morning got me out by 6:10ish. The humidity had already begun and I could tell it would be a tough day. There were three significant climbs right away that tested me. The rocks, roots, mud, bugs and humidity really pushed me to my limits. I pushed about 13 miles before lunch fairly unhappy with my pace. I shouldn't be-- it was pretty good for the terrain I had hit but I think my proximity to the end motivates me and also frustrates me. My body is ready to be done but completion is not something I can achieve within a day of hiking. For a type A personality, that's hard.
I ate lunch on the side of the trail without anyone passing. It was a fairly quiet day. Afterwards, I climbed Bemis Mountain. I could never seem to drink enough water and just cameled up every time I hit a source and carried around a liter. Sweat covered everything, there was no avoiding it unfortunately and I had to get comfortable being uncomfortable quick.
On the way down the second peak of Bemis Mountain I ran into a few other thru hikers. A couple with a small child on their back that called themselves ""start them early."" They hike the AT in three sections. I also met Eagle who was sitting next to a cooler. Trail magic has been fairly rare lately but this was a welcomed surprise of ginger ale and water with a few snacks to munch on. We sat here and chatted for a bit-- both somewhat complaining about the day. I'm so close but still so far.
I made my way past the trail magic to Bemis Stream that required a ""forde."" I say this lightly because I only took my shoes off at the very end to avoid them being wet in camp. It was 5pm and I decided to stop at the Campsites across the stream happy with the mileage although I had hoped to make it a few more to the next shelter. Chafing has a way of stopping physical activity.
I set up my tent then laid in the stream soaking in the cool water and getting attacked by black flies. Again, not glamorous. It helped cool me off and I ate dinner then relaxed a bit before calling home and Abby with the service I was surprised to have. Two Clicks showed up around 6 and we both retreated to our tents to avoid the bugs. A quiet night.","Dunn Notch Gap/waterfall

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596143,"A day of big mileage but it was nice to get just a bit closer to Katahdin. This morning we woke up and put on our wet clothes. My least favorite part of the day. Packing up my bag, I was swarmed with mosquitoes so I made it happen quick. The first half of the day was mellow hiking. No crazy ups or downs but I will not say the word flat because that is NEVER true.
The humidity could be felt even when hiking at 6am and eventually you just become accustomed to being soaked. Thank God for Body Glide. I pushed it quicker in the beginning to allow myself to slow down while climbing over the Saddleback's. I took few breaks and only saw a few other hikers but the legitimate swarm of mosquitoes following me kept me walking. I wish I could outwalk them. I ended up putting on my mosquito net for the first time ever. It was bad. I think I feared looking soft or like an idiot but I realized: one- I always look like an idiot and two- I didn't care what people thought I couldn't handle the bugs any longer.
By noon I had hit the Piazza Rock Shelter. I ate lunch alone and took off my shoes and socks to dry them out. The mud was rough today too. I had some coffee, elevated my feet and put on new socks before leaving. All of this really helped. This shelter has a privy with two seats. They face each other and have a cribbage board in the middle. Pretty disgusting! The horde loves cribbage though so I imagine they'll enjoy this place!
I pushed on up Saddleback feeling good probably because of the coffee and new socks. I got above treeline and was pleasantly surprised with the breeze and the ridge walk. It all helped with the temps, the bugs and the morale. I made a phonecall at the top with the service I had then pushed on. Two more climbs over The Horn and Saddleback junior before descending to Poplar Ridge Shelter. 
I set up tent a little ways north of the shelter. The bugs have been so bad I've been avoiding the shelters like crazy. I grabbed water and hung out. The ridge walk at the end of today helped dry my clothes and the sun did the rest so I was pumped to not have to put on wet clothes in the morning. I ate a ton as Two Clicks and I agreed to go into Stratton tomorrow for a resupply and a pick-me-up dinner in town. I need it. The tentsites weren't great here so he tented near the shelter and it was a quiet night. Maybe I should be a bit more social. Tomorrow maybe. Headed to bed tonight.

",Poplar Ridge Lean-to,"Jul 03, Tue",24.70
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596244,"This morning felt nice at elevation and I got up around 5:15 in a fairly decent mood. Packing up, I could hear the shelter murmur then Two Clicks passed by at about 5:30. Pretty early! He pushed on and eventually I got out around 6 or so.
Unfortunately, we were headed down the mountain and the humidity and bugs could be felt pretty quickly. I will say I think I was lucky today. The bugs seemed to leave me alone until later in the day and I didn't even put on bug spray. I try not to if I don't have to. That hiker who told me ""that stuff is bad for you"" would be happy. Yes, I do hold some grudges.
We ""forded"" the stream at the bottom (it was rock hoppable but our guidebooks said we would need to) then made our way up towards Lone and Spaulding Mountains. Up on the ridge it was nice once again and the trail seemed to be fairly forgiving. It was soft pine needles with some rocks and roots but some of the best trail yet. The only bad thing was there were so many blowdowns. They slow you down for sure. When I was bypassing a blowdown today, I must have scared a quail of some sort. She had her babies all around her and as I approached, she attacked! I had this happen the other day too! Out of all animals I think birds scare me the most. They can attack from all angles and from the air and I don't have an Air Force to protect me. I am strictly a ground unit. I flail my trekking poles around hoping she would keep her distance and did my best to get by. I'm not here to hurt you! There were no incidents but birds still aren't my thing.
I pushed to the first shelter and asked a few southbounders where the water was. I've seen way more southbounders than northbounders for sure. Two of them pointed towards the water and we got to talking. They are from Exeter, NH! They write blogs for the trek and just hit the 200 mile mark so if you're interested, I believe the guys name was sugar feet. The woman didn't have a trail name yet. It was pretty cool though. Small world.
After the shelter I climbed the shoulder of Sugarloaf Mountain. The trail doesn't go over the top and that was okay with me. At the bottom of the ravine, I ate lunch next to a river that again we were supposed to forde but someone had placed a wooden board across to make it. Here, I downed pretty much the rest of my food and drank as much water as I could with a double coffee. I was packing up as Two Clicks arrived and he took lunch here too.
The last climb of the day was over south and north crocker mountains. Just a quick 2000' gain in two miles. No biggie with a double coffee haha. I pushed up the mountain and was there before I knew it. No real views but it was done. I got over to the north summit and texted home with service then descended towards Stratton. On the way down we would hit the 2000 mile mark and Two Clicks had asked me to wait for him to take his picture. I did most of my waiting at the top of North Crocker before the bugs got too bad. On the way down I found the ""2K"" sign written in rocks on the trail. Luckily I didn't have to wait long because the bugs were getting super bad.
After I took his picture we pushed on to the bottom to ME 27. Here I attempted to hitch with the small amount of cars passing and after a half hour finally got one. Two Clicks was beat and decided to go to a hostel tonight. He had already called them and they were coming to get him but I took the hitch to the store 3 miles east.
I considered staying at the hostel but ended up resupplying for the 3-4 days to Monson then eating the crappy pizza and sandwiches they had with some Gatorade and root beer. I called Two Clicks letting him know I was moving on as we had planned that morning but no answer so I texted him. I got a hitch back to the trailhead after waiting 20 minutes (come on Maine I figured it would be easier!) Then pushed on just under 2 miles to a campsite. Two Clicks and I always attest to being solo hikers and so separation was somewhat inevitable. I'll admit I'm not the most jolly in the heat and I also have had a rough time leaving the short stay in Bethel with Abby and getting back to the grind even though it's less than 200 miles left. 200 miles is still significant and I've got to keep in the hiking mode.
At camp I skinny dipped in the stream (wooo! Happy 4th!) Then set up shop and ate a little bit more. The cold water felt amazing and I was able to clean my legs of mud and make all my bug bites feel a little bit less itchy. I laid in my tent to avoid the mosquitoes and hung out alone at the tentsite.
P.S: In the heat, it seems I am participating in a water crawl. I pretty much crawl from water source to water source and guzzle water. It's funny because sometimes I'll bypass a source thinking I have enough water until the next but then I'm instantly thirsty as soon as I pass. Oh well, I've made it so far and the heat will be over after tomorrow!
I'm also really surprised at the service I've had in Maine! Yay Verizon!","Poplar Ridge Lean-to
",Cranberry Stream Campsite,"Jul 04, Wed",23.30
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596528,"Today was a good day. Hot but good. I woke up around 5 and got out at 6 ready to tackle some of the last tall mountains between here and Katahdin. I'm sure I'll regret saying that. I ascended the Bigelow's! The first knoll I hit had a great view of the various peaks as well as Sugarloaf across the way. It wasn't an easy climb but it was fun and I was glad to be up high in elevation. Another scorcher!
I got up to the main peak and made a phone call, ate a snack and drank as much water as I could. I'm not kidding when I say I can't drink enough. At Avery Peak (named after Myron Avery who was a lawyer and essentially formed the AT with Benton Mackaye) I took in the views then went back down hill. I honestly would have rather kept climbing or walking a ridge to avoid the heat below but it was inevitable. I began the climb to little bigelow peak (seems like an oxymoron) and guess who I met! Hungry Cat! He was feeling the pain of the heat too. We chatted for a few minutes. I let him know I've been fangirling over his journal for a while and that my mom reads it. I did my best to not be creepy, although, let's be honest--- it's pretty creepy. We parted ways and I hiked down to the shelter for lunch where I sat and ate alone, again, guzzling water.
After lunch the terrain got a whole lot more forgiving. Still rocks, roots and plenty of mud but bearable. Miles went by a bit quicker but the sweat dripping on every part of my body moved quicker too. Hungry Cat had had his mosquito net over his head and after lunch I did the same. I swear I wasn't just trying to be as cool as him. Seeing him do it though did make it cool. The mosquitoes were bad. I had even considered picking up one of the large frogs I see on trail every 10 minutes and placing it on my pack. That way they could chill, get a free ride and eat a ton of bugs for lunch. Haven't done it yet but I am beginning to highly consider it.
At the next Shelter I ran into Hungry Cat again as he had passed me during lunch. Honestly he's the only northbounder I've seen all day and the only one in a few days aside from Two Clicks. We chatted about our plans for Monson coming up then I pressed on. I hiked another 3.7 before it hit 5 o'clock. Kind of my unwritten stopping time. I just like to be in camp and chill. I found a stealth spot as I'd hoped to right next to the pond. A massive pond at that! I set up shop then grabbed my stuff to go swimming. It was THE BEST beach area. Soft sand for 20 feet out and nice refreshing water to cool me off, clean my legs and get the gross, sweaty feeling off me. The breeze off the lake dried my clothes too! It was funny because as I was nearing this lake with plans to stealth, I had asked a few southbounders if they had seen any sites. All of them said no but I was sure I'd find one. It's ok, they're just starting so I'll give them a break. Honestly, props to them for starting up here. It's not easy!
Hungry Cat passed by as I was getting out and he let me take a picture with him as a souvenir for myself and to send to my mom haha. Hes a cool guy but he pressed on another 6 or so miles to the next Shelter so that he would be in a good position for town stuff. I think we'll see each other again! The evening passed quick and I was ready for tomorrow when the heat quit even if that meant rain.","Cranberry Stream Campsite
",East Carry Pond,"Jul 05, Thu",25
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596529,"I woke up with excitement. Excitement to hit the small milestones I set for myself. Some days those milestones are more exciting than others and today's were up there on the list. The weather forecast I had been able to get from Abby when I was on the phone with her the other day (service has been pretty spotty and posting journals is not top priority--sorry) said that there would be rain beginning at 5am and lasting until about noon. Well, it was spot on. When I started tossing around 5 and looking for an alarm clock to snooze (I wake up with the birds and sun around 4:30 every morning nowadays) I began hearing small raindrops. The breeze off the water had stopped overnight and the storm was coming. That got me moving.
I packed quicker and more efficiently than normal then got outside to break down my tent before it got wet. If I can avoid packing a wet tent I do! I had made it. Only a few drops to note and I didn't even get wet myself. I was extremely thankful. It's the little things for sure. My goal this morning was to be at the Kennebec river by 9 when the ferry started. That gave me just over 3 hours from my 545 start time to make it 10 miles. A challenge but doable.
The terrain was forgiving. Plenty of rocks and roots still but mixed in with pine needles and dirt. I loved it. The storm did in fact move in and it came in hard. There was audible thunder but I couldn't see the lightning. It rained off and on for 30 minutes or so before dumping buckets. The humidity had stuck around though so I just covered my pack with my poncho and let myself get soaked. It actually felt really nice and I had been proactive that morning about chafing and had applied body glide liberally.
I took one spill right in a nice fat puddle of mud and water but I walked it off. I was making great time and rolled up to the South bank of the Kennebec at 8:40! Hungry Cat and another hiker were here already and we chatted about the ferry service. For those that don't know, the Kennebec rivers spans 40ft or more and is the largest unbridged body of water on the AT. With a dam up stream and unscheduled releases of that dam,the ATC and AMC run a ferry service across for hikers. It runs from 9am-2pm during this peak season and is simply a guy in a canoe that brings you across. Well, we hung around until 9 before seeing a man on the other bank dragging the canoe to the water. We were happy to see this because we weren't sure if it would run with lightning in the area.
Mike, the canoe guy, pulled up to our shore and had Hungry Cat and I sign waivers. The other hiker who was before me had offered to let me go before him and even after telling him to go first he insisted. So, we threw on our life jackets and jumped in with Mike in the rain to cross the river. We got to the other side and unloaded before Mike rowed back for the others. Hungry Cat and I pressed on only a 1/4 mile to US 201 and Caratunk, ME.
At the road we walked not far off trail to the Caratunk Hostel. This place was great. Hungry Cat had some postal stuff to do and I was just hungry. I had been able to call last night from my tent and confirmed they sold food so I was definitely stopping. We walked in and were able to dry off a bit and eat. They specialize in BBQ pulled pork and milkshakes. Literally the two things I dream of. I ate two sandwiches, a milkshake, a Gatorade, a coffee and a cinnamon bun before also purchasing a few snacks for later and some more bug spray. Woo! I even got to wear a sweet loaner button down while hungry cat and I chatted and ate. I paid my tab then said goodbye to hungry cat who had to sort out his mail. I hoped to see him again in Monson where we both planned to stop next.
Well, with 10 miles under my belt already I aimed to get 16 by noon. I set off around 10:20 from Caratunk and hit the trail hard. It was a great day to push myself as the rain had stopped (just as Abby had said it would! Thanks Abby) and the terrain continued to be nice.
I plodded along as the miles passed and I had to forde Holly Brook. The river had swollen from the rain and although it may have normally been rock hoppable-- it wasn't now. I didn't bother trying to stay dry and just walked right through the water. My feet dried fairly quickly in the trail runners and it was no big deal. That's what foot powder is for later!
I stopped at the shelter 20 something miles in for a snack and ran into a section hiker sleeping inside. She claimed to be cold but man I thought this was the best hiking weather. Almost like fall with a breeze. We talked and it was nice to have conversation. There's not many people around to talk to and I only see the southbounders briefly in passing. I took off after 15 minutes and made sure to keep snacking a lot today. The full meal in Caratunk pushed me far and so lunch wasn't necessary.
I got up to Moxie Bald Mountain and took a break, ate a snack and called Abby with the little service I had. It was windy up here and pretty chilly! After half an hour I packed up and hiked the remaining 2 miles down to the shelter. I considered pushing a bit further to shorten tomorrow but I was beat and it was 530. I also kind of craved conversation here and so after setting up my tent, I sat at the picnic table (the first one I've seen since VT) and chatted with a group from Quebec. They were high school aged and asked me a ton of questions. My minor in French didn't help the conversation at all but luckily they knew English and it was nice chatting with them.
Everyone else around camp was huddled in their sleeping bag as if it was freezing. Just a bit of wind but manageable! Once the Quebec group left for their tents I did the same and sat around writing this. Headed to Monson tomorrow for a stay in a hostel, food and the first shower in 7 days! This is 100% the worst smelling I've been and it's wonderful.
P.S: I've been wearing my bug mask fairly often. However, when I hike I tend to spit and clear my sinuses via snot rockets often as anyone who has hiked with me would attest to. Well, this has been a problem because just like in jail, spit doesn't go through the bug mask. It might as well be a spit mask for inmates except I voluntarily put it on. I forget it's there sometimes and accidentally spit in it! Whoops!","East Carry Pond

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596539,"There's no way I can complain about the cooler weather. It felt great this morning. But, it made it real hard to get out of my sleeping bag. I eventually got up and out by 6 and could feel the motivation. I hadn't showered in a week and the salt stains along with the smell was getting to me. I was beat 
I began hiking in the cool, crisp air. It felt like a nice fall day. Reminded me of early season cross country races with the breeze and cooler temps while the sun was shining. The first river that was noted as a forde in my guide ended up being nothing to note. But, by the time I reached the second, I had no choice. There was a rope strung from one bank to the other and zero rocks to hop along. I held on to the rope, undid my pack straps and trudged through. No sense in taking off my shoes, they would dry. It was actually really fun! The water felt great on my feet in the shoes and cooled them off. It felt great up until the point I came out on the other side and realized I was not an amphibian. Then- my shoes were twice the normal weight and I just had to keep walking.
I strutted along the edge of the river for a while. I passed by a cool canyon with drops to my left for 100 feet or so! Eventually, the river was again at the same height as myself and I crossed again. This time, there was no rope to help. The water was knee deep and I forded once again even though my shoes had already dried.
The forests were rich. Birds and deer were abundant. It was a nice hike. Bill Bryson did no thru hikers any favors by calling it a walk in the woods though. It's so much more than that and I don't think he could even fathom it's complexity. You might be able to tell, myself and every other thru hiker are not fans of his book.
I hiked through the woods as I heard what I believe was a falcon call. I got closer and closer until all of a sudden the bird came within inches of the top of my head as if to protect it's young from me. I had no Air Force to deploy and so I was stuck in the flight response-- strictly as a land unit. I ran a bit to get away. Birds really aren't my thing.
I eventually made it close to Monson and made the final push up a few inclines. When I reached ME 15, I ran into two other thru hikers named Scootch and Apollo. Hungry Cat had mentioned their names. They were very nice and had called Shaw's hostel already for a shuttle. So, instead of hitching, I jumped in with them!
I got to the shuttle and went to work. I showered, did laundry with a fellow NOBO hiker named Gumby that I had known and resupplied in town. It was an amazingly relaxing afternoon since I had arrived around noon. I ended up at a BBQ place in town and let me tell you, this was the best BBQ I've had! If you ever find yourself in Monson- try it out. Country music was even playing in the background!
I went back to the hostel and enjoyed some Maine Shipyard Summer Ale while taking in the final moments at the last hostel I would stay at on trail. Surreal. Onto the 100 Mile Wilderness!","Moxie Bald Mountain Lean-to
","Monson, ME","Jul 07, Sat",18
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596824,"I want to start off by thanking the crew of NOBOs at Shaws last night. We were outnumbered by southbounders- which was cool- but we all managed to go out to the local restaurant together around 7 to eat, drink and reminisce on the trail. It was real nice and we ended up staying there a long time. I think we were all pretty amazed. Thank you Hungry Cat, Apollo, Skutch, Gumby and Red Bird. It was a nice way to spend the last night in a trail town and in the last hostel with you guys.
I slept really well last night but was up around 5:15. I went downstairs and hung around drinking coffee and looking at some of the AT photo books in the hostel living room. Eventually, more people came down and I'll say, this place was packed! Like I said-- it was mainly southbounders and section hikers so us five going North definitely connected well.
Gumby, Red Bird, Skutch and Apollo were planning a bigger day than Hungry Cat and I so they had attempted to arrange an earlier shuttle. Well the amazing breakfast of eggs, bacon and home fries with all you can eat blueberry pancakes ran a bit longer than expected. They got out around 8. Hungry Cat and I squared up our bills with Poet, the owner. Seems like he was stretched thin trying to do so much there but this was definitely a sweet hostel!
Our shuttle got out around 830 and we got to the trailhead. Everyone except Hungry Cat, a section hiker and I were going south. The three of us said thanks to Poet then headed North. We took our pictures at the warning sign for the 100 mile wilderness. 10 days of food needed???--- how about 4.5???
I took lead and we spread out in our own pace. I had said goodbye to Hungry Cat too because I was hoping to summit a day before him meaning he could take it slower. The terrain in the beginning was fairly easy. Tons of roots and such but I can't complain. The bugs held off until the evening too which was nice! Some sun but not too hot, a pretty great hiking day.
At the first river forde, I caught up to Apollo and Skutch. They had both managed to rock hop the stream as I rolled up and I figured it would be no problem! Well, I was mistaken. My trekking pole, which is pretty much broken but hanging on for the last 100 miles, collapsed as I relied on it to stretch from one rock to another. That put me off balance on the slippery rocks and I took a swim. It was loud enough for Apollo and Skutch to hear and they turned around to make sure I was Okay. More embarrassed than anything else! I was good though. I am very clumsy.
I took a mental break after the fall and ate a snack. Soon enough I caught up to them and we laughed about it. I was pretty much dry! The next forde, I just walked through. I must have looked crazy to the southbounders putting back on their shoes after they had changed into their camp shoes. I didn't hesitate to walk in haha. At this point I don't care. I have 100 miles and just need my gear and things to last a few more days!
I ran into some vets doing a charity hike through the Wilderness carrying rocks for the Wounded Warrior Project where they'll end on Katahdin. It was cool! I saw tons of people on trail today. More than I have in a while! I thought this was supposed to be a remote wilderness! There were people day hiking Barren Mountain!
On Barren Ledges and at the peak I had some sweet views. You could get the sense for the desolate area you were in. I could only see some windmills in the distance, other than that I couldn't see any man-made things. Humbling for sure. I did hear what I thought was a logging operation going on which I later realized was a trail maintainer clearing blowdowns who I ran into shortly after.
There was a shelter just below the summit 0.4 miles off trail. I had done 19 and didnt plan to do much more than that but I couldn't bare to walk that far off trail. Unfortunately, the next water was almost 6 miles from there with few stealth sites in between that I could see. So- I killed myself to get there. The 6 miles wouldn't have been tough normally but they were just PUDs (pointless ups and downs) that killed me. I was hurting. I made it to the stream and found a pretty crappy stealth spot just off trail on a blue blaze. I was too tired to care though and set up shop. I ate as much as I could to lessen my load for tomorrow then listened to some James Taylor as I wrote this and relaxed in the tent. Tomorrow will get me over THE LAST elevation of any significance until Katahdin!
P.S: Hiker Bios:
Gumby: A retired Air Force service member who has six kids and he's around 50 years old. He's from somewhere down south and is a really cool guy. He can push big miles!
Skutch and Apollo: Probably a little older than myself. They both ran college track and are dating. I believe they are from Ohio but it could be Michigan. I'm blanking right now. Really nice people!
Red Bird: A bit older than me from somewhere down south. I don't know much more about him though! He plans on thru hiking some more trails in the future though. Also a great guy.
Hungry Cat: Go read his Journal! He's the man!

I got out before 6 even though I told myself I could sleep in. I think that's impossible. I like hiking in the morning air even if it is hard to get up and get my body back in the groove. I passed by Skutch early on and learned that the last few PUDs had been tough for her and Apollo too and that they had in fact stealth camped just around the corner from me. The first few climbs went quickly then I was headed down hill towards the West Branch of the Pleasant River. Here, I ran into the ridge runner for the area. I had in fact ran into the other ridge runner for the wilderness yesterday and it was nice to see them. They are there to educate hikers and both gave me some good information on hiking Katahdin and how to have my family meet me at the end because there are a lot of rules and plenty of logistics to take into account.
I forded the river in my shoes then sat on the North bank and made some coffee while allowing my shoes to dry a bit. They didn't really but I tried. I had a double dose of instant coffee which helped my mood a lot then pressed on up towards Gulf Hagas which is supposedly the ""Niagra Falls of Maine."" Unfortunately the trail doesn't go by it so I couldnt tell you if it is but someday I'll come back out and see it!
I continued the nearly 8 mile gradual climb and reached the top of Gulf Hagas Mountain from here the trail then went over the west peak, Hay Mountain and then White Cap Mountain with drops in between each. I had finally made it up to White Cap. Considered the last of any significant elevation until Katahdin. White Cap sits at 3650' and the highest I would get in the next 70 miles was 1980' until the end. Crazy! They call White Cap the ""phone booth"" because it is one of the only places with service in the wilderness and I was able to call Abby and my mom to solidify plans for summiting and getting out of Baxter.
I had been surprised with the amount of day hikers and people on these summits. At one point I turned a corner and had 15 teenage girls staring at me as I awkwardly said hello and passed by with small talk. I guess I just expected fewer people. I even saw two trail crews out today too along with plenty of SOBOs.
From just north of the White Cap summit, I got my first glimpse of Katahdin. It was massive and looked so close. My first reaction was ""so that's the damn mountain I've been hiking towards for four months."" Then it became crazy thinking less than 70miles would separate me from it tonight.
I hiked down to the next Shelter and grabbed water while relaxing. There was a SOBO named face plant there who gave me some tips for Baxter and I met a NOBO named Shaggy who I hadn't met before. I sat and hung around for a bit before pushing another 3 miles to the next Shelter. This had been my goal for the day but it was early and I was feeling good so I pushed another two miles. I had to stop here to get some food in me though because I had skipped lunch and ran out of snacks allotted for the day.
By 430 I made it to a pond and found some nice stealth spots. I walked an extra 0.3 miles to get water from a spring just ahead instead of from the pond because the spring water was nice and cold. From there I had plenty of time to hang around, do some extra chores and eat as much as I could. The only bad thing about the easy terrain to Katahdin are the bugs and heat but with 66 miles to the top of Katahdin I think I'll survive!","Stealth Campsite mile 2100.7
",Mountain view pond,"Jul 09, Mon",24.30
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596826,"I woke up to a strong breeze coming off the pond. No moose this morning, or at least no drill Sargent to wake me up for one (Two Clicks). I packed up and got out by 6. As I turned the corner towards Boardman Mountain- the mosquitoes attacked. The wind had died down and they lay in ambush for me. They literally had me running, hopping and slapping down the trail it was so bad. I took a quick deet shower and felt my skin begin to burn but at least they were taken care of!
The only significant climb of my day was right in the morning. Up and over Little Boardman mountain then essentially along some nice easy terrain the rest of the day. The climb went quick then I was up and over the other side. A lot of the day was simply walking along the Jo-Mary Lakeside. Sometimes I was close enough to see it and others I was just happy to have nice easy hiking. The terrain was fairly forgiving all day until a bit later when there were more roots and rocks to stab at my feet.
I found myself thinking a lot today. Thinking about my favorite times on trail. Thinking about all the people who got me through such a demanding endeavor. Thinking about how lucky I was to be out here and how excited I was to be home. And what I thought a lot about was kind of sad-- the loved ones my family and I had lost in the past few years. I hoped that I was making them proud. My grandparents on both sides of the family and my Uncle Stephen and Dan were on my mind. I imagine they were looking down on me. I couldn't help but remember all the awesome memories I had with each of them. They were my childhood and early adulthood. My mom had sent me a letter with Abby to Bethel, ME last week with my grandmother's name on it. It was a note from her old note pad. My mom had circled her name and said ""she's watching out for you too."" It made me smile.
I thought about these things for a while and the time along with the miles passed by. I had taken a coffee break around 8 then stopped for lunch at a shelter at noon. Here, I drank more coffee and ate a lot. Anything goes at this point in the trail. Not on purpose, I even avoided the quick rain shower that came by at noon and managed to stay dry all day. I'm sure someone's looking out for me.
I pressed on the last 10 miles of my somewhat long day and the terrain got just a bit more rooty. I walked along a stream for a while then another lake where there was a view to Katahdin! The sun shone in and out and the temperatures stayed mild as I wore my bug mask. Right as I was getting tired and ready to be done, I came to a campsite. Now I really don't think the 100 mile wilderness is as remote as they say it is and there was a Tupperware container with two Hershey bars in it. I ate one and luckily Apollo and Skutch ate the other. Not sure when I got ahead of them!
That fueled me for the last 3 miles and I rolled into camp at 345. Man was it early to stop but I had done the miles I wanted to do and if I pushed further it would make tomorrow and Thursday extremely short. I knew I was summiting Friday and had to spread out the last 38 miles. I sat and talked to some nice section hikers headed south then Apollo and Skutch showed up (apparently Skutch is an Italian word for ""pest""). I had found a toy bear attached to a thru hiker tag hanging on a tree earlier today and asked them if they knew who's it could be. Had to be a NOBO just ahead of us. They agreed it may be Shaggy's and said they would continue delivering it forward as they were pushing another 8 miles. Shaggy had hoped to summit on Thursday with all of them so my hope was that he would be reunited with it eventually. It seemed like something important.
I hung around camp for a while feeling weird being at a shelter. Still, I tented just because of the bugs. A south bound hiker named ""Nature Boy"" came by to eat dinner then camp at the lake just a little ways back. He lives on the trail. He has no income and relies on EBT to pay for his food and gear. He kept talking about stories from down south in the cold and it seems he is drastically unprepared for cold weather. Not sure how I feel about him. Anyway, I excused myself from conversation (now I know why I like tenting better) and put my feet up as I lay in the tent writing this. Looking forward to my Mountain House meal I splurged on in Monson tonight then a 19.6 mile day tomorrow where I'll be right near the border of the wilderness and Baxter State Park before hitting the camp store Thursday morning and working out the registration to summit Friday.","Mountain view pond
",Wadleigh Stream Lean-to,"Jul 10, Tue",27.70
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596928,"What a great day. I woke up with no stress at all. I had all day to hike a meager 20 miles over mild terrain to the last shelter of the 100 Mile Wilderness. Zero issues. If I did what I would normally do, that 20 miles would be done by 1 or 2 so I had to chill. I ""slept in"" until 5:30 then started making movements. It's tough because I'm around a bunch of SOBOs. They're all brand new and still have that look of ""oh shit what did I get myself in to"" that we all had back in Georgia. So I was the first one up and ended up being the catalyst for most of them to start moving.
I got up and ate, took my time packing then ended up making coffee outside the shelter. A double dose of Starbucks instant coffee that I figured I would have done a few hours into hiking anyway so it worked. After that, I still got out by 6:30 and hiked up to a view point overlooking Katahdin. I took the side trail to a view that had a 16 mile line of sight view to the peak. It was great. I even had service here so I stayed for almost an hour catching up on journal postings and calling home to finalize logistics. Eventually, I made it off the top and began the rest of the hike.
The hike to Rainbow Stream Lean-to was slower than I expected based off the elevation profile simply because of the roots. Eventually I made it there though and had done 8.1 miles by 10 or so. I had met a bunch of SOBOs in this stretch and struggled with chatting with them. It's so tough. Do I tell them all about the good and get them psyched? Do I tell them there are so many days that I wanted to quit and stop hiking? How do I form the kind of wisdom to tell them that this has been the most difficult but most beneficial and life changing four months of my life into a few charismatic words? It's hard.
A lot of the day had me hiking along Rainbow Lake. The lake hikes are nice but very rooty and not as quick as I had hoped. By dumb chance I stopped at a random spot along the lake for water. I dropped my pack on trail and pushed through the trees to the lake to fill up. As I did, I looked south along the lake shore and saw another hiker named Ozzie who I had been around for the past few days. He was on a rock on the bank. I said hey! And he said, ""I fell."" He wasn't necessarily okay and I rushed over to see what was going on. He had taken a spill over some rocks and was bleeding pretty bad from his forearm, elbow, knee and shin. When I happened upon him he was attempting to clean some of the blood with a rag and lake water. With the supplies him and I had, we managed to stop the bleeding and clean his cuts. We used baby wipes, gauze pads and gauze rolls to clean then dress the wounds. He also had some Neosporin that we used too. It wasn't pretty and unfortunately I didn't have the things I would have hoped to use but we bandaged him up enough and I pushed him to take some ibuprofen. He's a Vietnam Vet and a wicked awesome guy finishing his sections of the AT that he started in 2015. I know the feeling of falling and being alone and I can only imagine what the feeling might be for someone older than me so I think he was glad to have someone else around.
By 12:30 he was cleaned and bandaged and I departed the lakeside after he told me he would be good. I climbed Rainbow ledges and had some sweet views of Katahdin past a group of roughly 18 high school Quebec girls who were finishing the 100 mile wilderness. I pushed just beyond the summit to eat lunch in the quiet of the woods away from the big group (no offense). Ozzie ended up passing me on lunch as I drank some more coffee and called home again with service. He was back to normal and feeling good!
The last descent to the shelter was unremarkable and when I got there, there were a group of 4 hikers who had flipped. They had made it to Harper's Ferry then come up to Katahdin to go south to avoid closure in the park and bad weather. They were not my style and gave me really creepy vibes. I made my stop here quick then decided to push on to Abol Bridge where I would either stealth camp or find a spot. 
It took only a few miles for me to hit the end of the 100 Mile Wilderness. I was pretty pumped to have done it in 4 days with about 4-4.5 days of food. I hit Golden Road, which is the first major road outside  the wilderness, and walked along it across the Abol Bridge. At first I was thinking it was just like every dirt road until I crossed the bridge and got the panoramic view of Katahdin with the Penobscot river in the foreground. It was amazing!
At the Abol Bridge camp store I ran into Ozzie again and we decided to meet for dinner. I ended up paying for a campsite because it was $20 with a breakfast buffet included! Woo! Around 5 we met in the restaurant attached to the store and shared a 6 pack of Long Trail while devouring some awesome food. They had a Thanksgiving dinner panini! (I know my mom would love it!) I'll tell you, when you're hungry while hiking-- Thanksgiving is thought of a lot! Today I was even singing Christmas songs in my head. Eventually we made it out of the restaurant and he showered while I set up camp and bought a 6 pack of baxter IPA to share with him. I didn't want to shower. I wanted to embrace the stink for one more day. We had made it out of the 100 mile wilderness in 4 days and we were excited! What a cool accomplishment. We made friends with a few NOBO flip Floppers who ended in Bland, VA named Wallis and Mouth. The four of us ended up hanging around the campsite drinking beers and reminiscing on the trail. We told Wallis and Mouth what to expect in the wilderness and they were excited! What a great night.

P.S: well I paid $2 for an hour of WiFi at the campground to post this! What luxury haha. I feel like I'm on a plane!

Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597140,"My mattress that's had a small hole in it for the past few weeks really struggled last night. I woke up on the ground so much that it just became something I no longer worried about. I had the opportunity to buy a new mattress in Monson but it just wasn't what I wanted and I would survive a few more days with mine. After tonight though I'm pretty ready to sleep in a bed. Just one more night!
That's such a crazy thought i've been having. I've been out here for four months sleeping in a bed only on and off. Re-integrating to society will be crazy! It only has been four months and I've lived in society for 22 years but the transition back is going to be interesting. I hope to hold onto the beard for a few days at least and sit back with my feet elevated trying to bring my body back to life. Oh and I'll shower multiple times.
I suppose my first step in the transition back to the world was sleeping in a campground last night. I have a massive site to myself and all that's on it is my tiny single person tent. Meanwhile everyone else has their cars and massive tents or RVs and is hanging around watching TV on a portable device. There was, however, a guy playing some JT outside by his picnic table though (James Taylor not Justin Timberlake). My man! It was funny watching a few guys my age waddling to the bathroom too. They had been on a hike to prepare for hiking Katahdin tomorrow and were really sore. I totally get it but I suppose it's cool to observe society like this from a different perspective of having hiked for 4 months. Ozzie said to them ""that looks like it hurts!"" We didn't tell them how far we had come. It would have just been mean. It made us smile though. I can't wait to go back to doing day hikes and such.
I lay in my tent this morning after waking up normal time around 5. I made my way over to the bathroom (that is one thing I like about the woods is that I could really pee anywhere but that probably wouldn't be acceptable here) then back to my tent to lay some more. Ozzie and I had planned to eat the breakfast buffet together then hang around and catch lunch at 11 before hiking our 9.9 miles to The Birches at the base of Katahdin for our final summit tomorrow!
We sat around the buffet for two hours and I ended up paying $2 to use the WiFi for an hour to upload a journal, talk to my parents and Abby and to kill some time. We closed down the bar-- breakfast bar that is, and I bought a few snacks and things to get me the next few days. I sat around waiting a lot and eventually worked up the energy to take down my tent and pack my bag before waiting some more for the restaurant to open at 11.
Around 1045, as Ozzie and I were talking with a Baxter ranger, and getting the low down on the park, Hungry Cat comes walking up from trail! He had decided to summit a day earlier than originally planned! We chatted and then he got into the store to grab snacks for the last day or so. He described it as ""a kid in a grocery store"" as he picked out a bunch of sugary snacks the same as I had done. Hey, it was our last chance to do this!
We all ate lunch together inside and I had the Thanksgiving sandwich again! After hanging out and eating, I got up and grabbed an ice cream cone from the store to finish me off. I may have slightly regretted the dairy further up the trail but the ice cream was good! I hiked out around noon to do the 10 miles to camp. A short distance and so much time.
The trail started off amazing. It was literally a dirt path along the side of the Penobscot River for a mile or two. I kept having to double check I was on the AT. This was so unlike the normal trail. Eventually it got more rooty and rocky but was nice. I took side trails to ""Big Niagra Falls"" and Daicey Pond to check them out. Around 330 I got to the Birches Campsite where there is a ranger station. I was in there with a guy named Frank. He's the one finishing his triple crown and he's from the Netherlands. We both signed in here and got our passes to climb, paid for the tentsite and got our numbers for summiting. #93 for thru hikers to hit Katahdin. Pretty cool!
We made our way over to the birches site and pitched our tents. Frank began grabbing wood and I did the same. As Hungry Cat and then Ozzie arrived we had a fire going and bathed in the smoke. It beat the mosquitoes! It was a nice night chatting around the fire as the sun went down and we prepared to end it all tomorrow.","Abol Bridge
",The Birches,"Jul 12, Thu",9.90
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597163,"Yes I know-- I ended on Friday the 13th. I'm not superstitious but I definitely considered the implications of this date! Glad I ended when I did though.
I woke up in the morning early around 4am to the sound of Ozzie packing up. He wanted to get out early so he could leave some gear at the ranger station to slack pack then get up the trail so that he would be able to grab a ride from my parents later on. I fell back asleep for a bit then woke up again around 5. I ran to the privy-- hopefully that's the last time I'll need to do that-- then slowly started packing. Breakfast this morning was a cinnamon bun poptart and a cinnamon bun. Sugar and carbs- the two essential food groups. I had the luxury of having breakfast in bed too.
It was a nice cool morning, perfect for hiking. Blue skies were above and, man, we all couldn't have picked better weather. Hungry Cat was up and packing as well and around 545 I said my goodbyes to him. I wasn't sure how everything would work out so I didn't know if we'd meet at the top. We did the classic fist bump and wished each other happy trails. As I was walking away he said ""oh, one more thing!"" And he tossed a bag of M&Ms my way. I caught them and smiled. Not sure if he knew chocolate was my weakness. He said ""for the top to celebrate."" I thanked him and walked off thinking ""man I love that guy."" Haha my girlfriend even called me out for the man crush later on that day.
I got to the Hunt trailhead and signed the register book there. Baxter Park is huge on signing in when you're hiking a trail for safety sake and I was happy to oblige with that. Shortly after 6 I was headed up the Hunt trail (AT) with 5 miles or so to the summit and the end. Crazy.
The trail started off mild with nice terrain then rock staircases to avoid erosion. Eventually, it became a bit more interesting though. My friend had warned me it was a lot more bouldering than you'd expect and he was right. Similar to Mahoosuc Notch, trekking poles were really of no use. It took commitment on this trail. You had to commit to grabs or holds in order to get up some of the scrambles. It was at this point I was glad to hike it alone because of it's technicality.
I caught up with Ozzie right before hitting a flatter section of trail above treeline called the tableland. We conversed on the difficulty of the trail but i know I really enjoyed it! Quite the way to end such a journey. On a monumental climb up a monumental mountain.
I passed Thoreau Springs and a group of three day hikers. I secretly was hoping to have the summit to myself for a few minutes. The first view of the peak was amazing and the knifes edge looked awesome! A hike I'll definitely be doing in the future! I finally got a view of the infamous Katahdin sign and from there it was an easy climb. I approached the sign and took it all in quietly as I touched the sign. I felt no need to yell or celebrate like crazy. It was more reflective and having the summit to myself for a few minutes gave me that opportunity. I touched he sign, looked at it for a minute then put my pack down and sat on a rock admiring the immediate beauty and the beauty I had seen throughout the last 4 months along the east coast. I thought about how immensly hard it had all been but how all that difficulty accumulates into utter satisfaction for having accomplished a journey so arduous. The feeling of finally experiencing the type 2 fun aspect.
I sat there for a while. I ate the M&Ms Hungry Cat had given me and enjoyed some other snacks. The group of day hikers arrived and I asked if I could bother them for a few pictures. ""Of course"" they said. I didn't want a big scene. Ozzie made it up shortly after and we took plenty of pictures for him including ones for his wife who's birthday was today. He had made a sign saying ""Happy Birthday Julie"" back at the campground. We also took pictures with his Vietnam Vet hat and shirt for his fellow infantrymen! It was fun.
Next came Hungry Cat who got up top and kissed the sign. It was hard being at the top because I didn't want to disturb everyone's moment. They deserve the same type of time I had to reflect so I wanted to give them that opportunity. Hungry Cat ate some snacks and we got a bunch of pictures of him as well. Another hiker had showed up as well. He was named Mainer and had finished the AT not too long ago and was number 14 for the year. He had decided to hike up Katahdin again as a day hike. He gave Hungry Cat and I Skittles. Thanks Mainer!
I sat up there a bit longer to see Frank finish. He only wanted one picture then was ready to be down. I pushed him to jump in a picture with Hungry Cat and I next to the sign and he did somewhat begrudgingly!
What an amazing experience up top. We lucked out 100% with weather and had awesome views. No real wind at all and I was able to sit up there in a t-shirt for about 15 minutes before getting cold enough to put on my quarter zip but not really cold much at all. We also lucked out with the summit popularity. There weren't too many people up there that early. When we began the descent down the blue blazed Abol Trail there were tons of people heading up to the peak.
I kept getting asked if I was part of some hiking group on the way down the trail. I would say no then kind of mumble ""no, I was just finishing the AT."" I wanted to say it casually so that nobody would make a scene. Everyone congratulated me and I appreciated it but at that point I was ready to be down. The adrenaline had worn off and I was tired. I wanted to be able to finally tell my body to rest after four tough months but still had 3 miles to the base. Wheres the helicopter pickup when you need it?
I also got the question ""how was the AT?"" How do I even begin to answer that? Amazing, beautiful, torturous, challenging, hot, cold, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and also the most amazing thing I've ever experienced. There was just no way to simply answer that question and I actually really dreaded that question. I would just spit out a variety of adjectives then say ""well the guys behind me are also finishing. One triple crowned, one is 40 and the other is 68."" I was just the 22 year old who had hiked it-- they all really were the cooler ones on the mountain. With that I would hike on and they would congratulate the others. I'm sure Frank hated that I told everyone he was triple crowning because he dreads social interaction. It kind of made me smile but all in good fun.
I got further down the mountain and all of a sudden found the word ""Phil"" written in sticks in two spots on trail. It was a bit creepy but I figured my parents or abby had written it. I pulled out my phone to take a picture of it and I heard a squeal ahead. Abby was waiting with my dad a little ways up and had spotted me finally. I hauled it around the corner and hugged them both-- really happy to see them. We laughed about the sticks my dad had written my name in then hiked down together. Only a little ways up we met up with my mom who had returned to the car for her phone to make sure I was coming down this way. I had made them wait a bit longer than expected. Sorry! We hugged then the four of us finished off the hike to the Abol Campground. They had packed a bunch of drinks and snacks for me and we began by devouring those.
Frank, Ozzie and Hungry Cat all showed up down here shortly after and took advantage of the food as well. Hungry Cat had heard my dad say my real name and goes ""oh is your name Phil?"" I said yes and he said ""that would explain why 'Phil' was written in sticks back there!"" My dad thought this was hilarious and it is. I had no idea Hungry Cats real name either until he told me after all this.
We all needed to get into Millinocket in a Toyota Camry so I opted for my parents to take the three of them into town first then come back and grab Abby and myself. They were happy to do so and they departed with the crew after we said our byes. Crazy to think we were all done and that this was the last time I'd see them.
Abby and I hung out on the porch of the ranger station in the beautiful afternoon sun. I drank my rootbeer as I rocked in the rocking chair and soaked it all in. I didn't have to rush to town to resupply, shower, do laundry and try to have time to relax. It didn't matter anymore. It was an amazingly weird feeling. Bittersweet to an extent for sure. We sat here for a bit as the crew was able to find hotel rooms in town. My parents came back for us and on the way out of the park I passed in my long distance hiking pass. The final step. On the way into town we stopped at the Sawmill bar and grill for food and beers. I soaked in the last few hours in crappy, smelly clothes where I would be accepted as a thru hiker. I know they say ""once a thru hiker always, a thru hiker"" but it will definitely feel different.
We got into town and relaxed at the hotel for a majority of the afternoon where I could shower and put my feet up. I was so happy to be surrounded by my parents and Abby comfortable and having accomplished a tremendous goal I set for myself. The bud lights my mom brought tasted so amazing.
We went out for dinner later on downtown then got back and watched Harry Potter. It was Harry Potter weekend-- my favorite! What a great ending day! I didn't sleep exceptionally well but got some rest. I think it'll take a bit to get a good sleep and fully rest. I thought about it and technically I haven't slept in the same bed for more than two nights the past 4 months. That is, unless you count my sleeping bag. It'll be strange knowing where I'm sleeping every night and being in the same bed.
In the morning we met up with Ozzie at the hotel breakfast then we all went downtown to the Appalachian Trail Cafe. Ozzie and I were able to sign a ceiling tile as having completed the trail and I signed near Hungry Cat and Green Grass. It was a cool way to leave my mark as I looked up at all the other hikers who had done the same. My parents kindly bought me some AT memorabilia then we drove Ozzie to Bangor so he could catch a flight tomorrow back home. From Bangor, we drove home. Back to reality.
P.S: I want to sincerely thank all of you who commented on the guest book. I want you to know I read them all and I am so grateful you all kept up with me and my hike. It's fairly strange learning how many people actually read this but I love it! To those of you planning a thru hike, good luck! Let me know if you have any questions. I'm no expert, I'm not ultra lite but I suppose I may be able to assist somehow. Anyone curious can find me on Facebook under my real name ""Philip Sheehy."" There I'll be posting a bunch more photos (like a ton!) And I'd love to have you see them. I may upload some on this site but honestly it's so difficult that I probably won't.
Also important! Stay tuned for a final wrap up essay of sorts (I hate saying essay because it sounds too schooly). I'll be reflecting on the trip in a huge variety of ways and I hope to post it on here as my final journal once I type it up in the next week or so at home.
Thank you again to everyone that supported me this entire journey. Of course my parents, Abby, friends and others I know. You guys are awesome! Thank you to the AT community, trail maintainers, trail angels, businesses along the way and to all the other hikers that truly make the AT the type of trail it is. I'll miss the comradery and acceptance we all had for each other and the world but I know a lot of that will transfer into real life. Happy Trails!","The Birches

I haven't heard from him since he got into the 100 Mile Wilderness but he has AT&T and just like Hungry Cat, service was pretty much non-existent. Follow Two Clicks on Instagram at ""northbound_ryan"" or on Facebook at ""Ryan Two-Clicks Youngs."" Wishing him all the best on Katahdin today!Thank you to everyone who continues to comment and congratulate me. I'm still working on putting my thoughts together for the final write-up as well as jumping back in to realities of life. Stay tuned!",,View Entry,"Jul 16, Mon",0
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598586,"Transition. It should be easy. Coming back into my twenty-two year “regular” life after only four months separated from it sounds easy. I would not use the word easy though just as I would not mutter the word “flat” while talking about the trail. There is just something that seems to be missing.

 

I’ve always been a homebody. I really do enjoy being home, having coffee in the morning and finding projects to keep myself busy. Carpentry, landscaping even cleaning! I am content being “normal.” With that, I suppose that is part of the reason why I ventured out to the Northern Georgia mountains to hike over 2,000 miles back towards home to Maine. I wanted to test myself. I wanted to try something so incredibly difficult but so amazingly endearing. Most importantly, I wanted to learn more about myself while doing something I love so much. Hiking has been a passion for me since I set out to climb Mt Washington with my high school friend Max Janik. This day hike gave me a physical challenge along with a small taste of the mental fortitude needed in hiking. We even camped out that night inspiring me further. From there, the spark lit and I caught wind of the NH Four Thousand Footers list. This gave me an individual challenge to conquer and I do well with those. I climbed Mt. Moosilauke, Owl’s Head and eventually ended the list with friends atop Mt Carrigain. Late high school into college the idea of hiking the Appalachian Trail came about and I could not let it go. I knew I was going to complete this monumental challenge. As David Miller says in his book AWOL on the Appalachian Trail “The reasons for a thru-hike are less tangible than many other big decisions in life. And the reasons evolve. Toward the end, possibly the most sustaining rationale to finish a thru-hike is the fact that you have started one” (2). I can speak from experience in saying that I had no overwhelming reason to hike the AT except for the fact that, I really wanted to do it. Simple.  
 

With all the planning that I did came the quick realization that none of it really helped. I could figure out an itinerary, look for THE BEST gear or figure out everything about the trail. The reality of it is that I learned more from day 1 than I did the entire few years of preparation. Plans change dramatically along the course of four months, hikers learn what gear works for them and swear by it, and the trail provides in more ways than one for all hikers on such an arduous journey. What I did not prepare for enough was the mental aspect of a thru hike. To be fair, I’m not sure how I would have done so but, nonetheless, this was easily the hardest part. It’s said that the mental aspect is 95% of a thru hike and that is absolutely true. Imagine waking up every morning for 120ish days regardless of weather, attitude or physical capabilities to hike anywhere from eight to twelve hours over some of the most difficult terrain in the United States. Doing so with a 20-30lb pack adds another level of difficulty. I quickly learned the mental fortitude it would take to complete this journey. Still, there were days I would get so mad, frustrated or sick of hiking that I found myself throwing my trekking poles and swearing at the trail. There were days where my hands were so cold I couldn’t do anything except grasp my trekking poles enough to continue moving. There were days where the climbs seemed to never end and the trail seemed to want me to continue falling and hurting every part of my body. But, as my new found friend, Hazmat, said to Two Clicks and I once: “The trail doesn’t care.” Once you TRULY realize this, the mental aspect continues to attempt to break you but you begin learning ways of dealing with it. Pains never go away and the terrain never gets easy but strategies like rewarding yourself, finding the sunshine in the rain and accepting misfortune as just another step of the trail begin to help you break through the difficulties. All these lessons translate over to everyday life too.

 

I was thrown into the trail so quickly it all seems like a blur even today. As my first journal noted, I signed the sheet at Amicalola State Park, was given a snickers bar then began up the approach trail to Springer Mountain. I had only a bit of backpacking experience but within the first few weeks I learned what gear worked, got my systems down and conformed to the diet I was eating. You become a machine on the trail. As a fellow friend on trail, Green Grass, had said “I’m turning calories into miles.” It becomes a monotonous game of eating, sleeping, hiking, hiking, and more hiking then repeating the cycle. There are days of full exposure to views and your surroundings then there are days of walking through the “green tunnel” where the goal is to just put in the miles and get another day closer. These days of monotony require stimulus. I had mentioned the contrast in stimulus in society vs hiking and it reigns true today. Society constantly batters you with stimuli that require interaction and reaction. On trail, often the only stimulus is the trail itself. Your body begins creating its own. AWOL says “I make no effort to control my thoughts or make sense of them. I’m just allowing myself a session of melancholy reminiscing. Alone, cruising serenely through the woods, is a situation that nurtures emotional liberation” (62).

 

A drastic misconception is that you will figure out your life on trail. Sure, you have plenty of time to think and sometimes plan out portions of your life. However, the more time you have to think, the more uncertainty you have about everything you are thinking about. It’s as if you need more time to think while knowing it will do no good. Conclusions are not often met in your mind. Instead, the time thinking allows you to learn more about yourself if you listen closely enough. You find your limitations along with the massive amount of strength you unknowingly have. You figure out what drives you and pushes you to reach a goal. You quickly realize the people who are important in your life. And most importantly, you learn to listen to yourself and your body despite the noise of life.

 

The physical aspect of the hike is of course challenging as well. We all joked that every night we would go to bed absolutely sure our bodies would never recover from the day of hiking. But, every morning in our hobble to the privy or shuffle to pack, our bodies would once again come back to life and push the physical capabilities we thought we had. For myself, I was lucky to not experience to many lasting injuries. The only “major” injury I experienced was a sprained ankle in North Carolina. However, I was lucky to not experience anything more serious with the constant falling I did, some of which were pretty bad. I took pride in being proactive about a few things and so did Two Clicks. Him and I did at least five minutes of static stretching every night. I can’t tell you how much I truly encourage this. If you can avoid injuries to your muscles before they happen then why wouldn’t you commit five minutes of camp time to it? The other thing I highly recommend is cleaning your feet. For me, this helped me avoid blistering by wiping off the sweat, dirt and grime every night. I only experienced roughly three blisters on the whole trail none of which were serious at all. With this also comes drying your feet. I added the extra weight of Gold Bond Foot Powder the entire trip to at least dry my feet at the end of the day. Trust me, it’s worth the small weight penalty! Hiking 2,190.9 miles is no simple task physically. It was extremely important to take care of my body and listen to it. You will become an animal as a hiker. Mountains won’t slow you down as much and the trail just becomes miles your feet need to cross. The down hills will hurt but the strength you gain will surprise you.

 

I couldn’t talk about my thru hike without acknowledging the support system I had back home and even across the entire trail. My parents and Abby were my top supporters. They answered my phone calls at all hours of the day, sent me equipment and gear needed to continue and worked out constant logistics back home. Let’s not forget the strength it took them to trust me and my skills even when they hadn’t heard from me in a while or there was a major storm coming. Even after the bear incident, I called home to update them. They had no immediate way of assisting and had to deal with the realities of trail and the dangers I faced with uncertainty. I give them major props for their help and encouragement throughout the four months. I truly think that a strong support system is a major reason why most hikers who finish are able to do so. Along with that came the remainder of my support system. Family, friends and strangers in town. You all helped me so much and I can’t begin to thank you enough for that. The encouragement on my posts, journal or through text helped push me to the finish and assisted me on the worst of days. The trail magic received was a morale boost and a look into humanity. I saw the best in people and learned that the world is full of amazing individuals. I also want to give a special shout out to those who came and met me on trail. Thank you to Skip, Ann, Mike, Max, Mrs Youngs, and course my parents and Abby. This was always a huge boost!

 

Also, the social aspect of the trail is phenomenal. The AT is known as the social trail for the amount of people hiking on it so often. It is so accessible to so many people that it only felt remote at certain times. One of the strongest bonds I experienced was the bond between other thru hikers. Typically, and I don’t mean to be rude, I could tell someone that was thru hiking from a mile away. There’s a look to them, a drive you can sense and a bond instantly held. Walking into towns, thru hikers would greet each other as if they had been best friends since they were children even if they had never met before. Experiencing the same challenges as well as celebrating the same accomplishments built a bond that only strengthened along the way. It was truly amazing. Thank you to all the hikers I met and especially the ones I hiked significantly with. You all know who you are and how special the connection became.

 

I coin my hike with a statement Two Clicks once said “We are homeless with money.” Having grown up in a pretty normal setting it was eye opening to see the world from a new perspective. From middle class to carrying everything on my back. I was lucky enough to experience life, even for just a short time, with a different point of view. This is not something you can experience unless you fully commit to living a new lifestyle. Lucky for me, I fully committed for four months. I experienced, as I said, the best of humanity. Free food, rides into town, encouragement and support along with the amazing thru hikers surrounding me. With this though, I also experienced some struggles while hiking. Towns that did not want hikers there, individuals who looked down on me for what I was doing and uncertainty of where I could sleep especially while in towns. In some ways I feel as though I can better relate to those who are not as fortunate as myself. This is absolutely one of the most important things I learned while hiking. It’s something that college can’t teach you just from reading books. I EXPERIENCED IT.

 

As soon as I touched the sign on Katahdin, I realized the immensity of what I had just done. Hiking 2,200 miles was an extreme challenge that most people will never accomplish- and most people have no intention of attempting. Hell, I had only hiked at most roughly 30 miles in one backpacking trip before this too. The thru hike was a day to day challenge. Katahdin was never the finish line and it couldn’t be. If I focused on Katahdin every day then I would have been even more miserable at times then I already was. As a Type A kind of guy, goals are something I like to accomplish often with speed. This hike helped me delve into being Type B at times which has significantly improved my life already. I began not planning my days ahead more than a day or two. I would go with the flow and stop for food or end a day short if necessary. I didn’t look at the elevation gain for the next day and if I did, it didn’t psych me out anymore. I lost a lot of my anxieties on trail and just let it happen. I was okay with being wet or cold because I knew that eventually I would be dry and warm. I didn’t try to outrun the storm but instead learned to appreciate the adversity and look at the bright side. All of these realizations have, and will continue to, help me be a better man in my everyday life.

 

Since being home, transition has been interesting. Lucky for me, I never really stop so I’ve been able to keep myself occupied. The first day back home, I woke up to three deer in my backyard as I poured a cup of coffee. It was like the trail was sending a final farewell and welcoming me back to my everyday life. Since then I began cleaning and organizing my gear so that hopefully I’ll be able to get back out for a multi-day hike sometime and enjoy being a day hiker once again. I took a few days of rest and have since gotten back into running along with the slow process of building my upper body strength back up after such a lack of use. I will say though, my endurance and lower body strength is the best it’s ever been as you can imagine. I started back working as an EMT and have been looking for full-time employment as well. I have edited my journals to print and create a book with, have gathered memorable items to create both a scrapbook and shadow box and have been rereading AWOL on the Appalachian Trail along with other thru hiker journals to reminisce. Two Clicks and I were able to get out to Crawford Notch last week to provide trail magic to hikers in the area. It was amazing and we both knew mostly everyone that came through both Southbounders and Northbounders! A few of the hikers going north were people I had last seen back in North Carolina! It’s been a crazy transition. I miss the physical aspect of hiking and drinking fresh mountain spring water. I miss the accomplishments of hitting my goals every day despite the conditions. I miss the comradery and friendships both on and off the trail. And what I miss the MOST is sleeping outside in my tent with the fresh air and simplicity of my small little spot in the world. It’s funny how I wanted the hike and all its difficulties to end but now severely miss those challenges. I want to give a shout out to Two Clicks who is currently beginning the Long Trail only two weeks after finishing the AT. He will be hiking the entire 280ish miles from the MA/VT border to Canada and repeating 105 miles of the AT in Vermont along the way!

 

Here are a few of the valuable lessons I learned along the way that translate to both trail life and normal everyday life:

1. Nothing is waterproof—Just learn to push through the lack of comfort. The sun will always come out again.

2. You don’t need to plan out your every step. Planning is great at times but often letting life just happen is more fun and less stressful.

3. You are stronger than you think both mentally and physically. Push yourself.

4.  You will complain about the cold until you complain about the heat. Learn to live in the moment because if you don’t- you’ll miss those moments.

5. The mountains don’t care. Keep pushing.

6. Don’t worry about tomorrow- tomorrow will take care of itself. (Thanks Dad)

7. Trust yourself. You know best.

8. Call your mom (and dad and girlfriend).

9. Appreciate those around you. 
10. Nature is an amazing healer and one of the best teachers. Appreciate it.

11. You can and will survive with less Things. Learn to appreciate what you have. You don’t need to feed into consumerism.

12. Never stop learning. Complacency kills.

13. Don’t choose a life, live one.",,View Entry,"Jul 28, Sat",0
Homebound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603833,"Throughout my hike I learned what gear worked for me and what gear needed to change. Some changes were out of necessity and others just out of desire. Here's a list of my updated list. I could have gone lighter and will absolutely do so on future hikes. Unfortunately, as experienced as you become, you still carry your fears in the form of added weight of unnecessary items. This is a look at the start, the end and the future...Sleeping Pad:Start: Therma rest Z-Lite folding MatEnd: Therma Rest NeoAir XliteThe folding mat just didn't cut it. It was cold, uncomfortable and awkward to carry on my pack. In Damascus, I bought the Neoair mat and loved that thing! It got a small hole in the last few 100 miles and I began waking up on the ground nightly but I patched it when I got home and have continued to use it since! I ended up cutting a piece of my Z fold mat up to make a butt pad to sit on in camp.Sleeping Bag:Start: EMS Boreal 20 Degree Long Mummy bagEnd: Mountain Hardwear Hyperlamina 3 Degree Long Mummy bagI began with the 20 degree and the first night on trail I instantly regretted it! At Mountain Crossings (Mile 31) I bought the Mountain Hardwear bag out of necessity. It's heavy and it wouldnt be my first choice normally but I'm glad I got it. I got my 20 degree bag back in PA and carried that throughout the second half of the hike except when I entered the Whites and had my 3 degree bag for a few weeks. So glad I did that!Pack:Start/End: Osprey Exos 58LLOVE this bag. Lightweight and comfortable. In the future I hope to get a smaller bag and cut my pack weight down significantly. This pack, however, was great and many hikers carry it! Looking into Mountain Laurel Designs and Superior Wilderness Designs PacksTent:Start/End: Marmot Tungsten 1PI like this tent but it's old and heavy. I am looking into a few other tents including the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 or maybe even a trekking pole tent like the ZPacks Duplex or something similar. This is where I could have saved the most weight in my pack.Shoes:Start: Merrell Moab BootsEnd: Oboz Sawtooth Trail RunnersI began with boots and quickly realized how unnecessary they were. I knew before I started that most hikers wore trail runners but I was stubborn. The boots worked great for me and their only fault was their weight and lack of breathability but once I wore trail runners I never looked back. They were especially convenient for fording rivers in Maine as the trail runners would dry quicker.Cooking:Start: Jetboil pot and stove with Sea to Summit SporkEnd: MSR Titan Pot and MSR Pocket Rocket Stove 2 with Seat to Summit SporkMy Jetboil was stolen by the bear in NJ and soon after I purchased the MSR products. They were much lighter and less bulky. I shaved off a lot of weight with this purchase and love them. I could actually cook food rather than burn it to my Jetboil! Somehow, I carried the same spork the whole way and never lost it!Water:Start: Sawyer Squeeze, Two 2L Smart bottles and a 32oz sawyer squeeze bladderEnd: Sawyer Squeeze, One 2L Smart Bottle, One Sport Smart Water and 32oz Sawyer squeeze bladderReality is, you don't need to carry 2L of water constantly. By the end I was carrying 1L at a time and used the sport bottle to have flavored drinks. My 1L bottle was ""dirty"" and I filled it right in the streams then drank through the sawyer squeeze. The sport bottle was ""clean"" meaning I would filter water into it. It was a great system. The filter slowed down by the end but worked well overall. The bladder was nice to have for camp when I needed more water to cook.Clothing:On a daily basis I wore- EMS brand zip off hiking pants and a EMS grey Tshirt. Nothing special. Both worked well for me and I only switched out my shirt once it got extremely dirty. The button came off my pants but I made it work and sewed it back on after the hike.For socks I wore Darn Tough and man am I darn happy I did. I had little to no issues with my feet and I got three new pairs of socks after returning the ones I owned which ended up getting holes in them. These socks are beasts and I wouldn't wear anything else.I wore Injinji toe socks for a few days to help with my toes swelling and blistering but other than that had no issues.I carried an Eastern Mountain Sports Downtek puffy the entire way. It was great for cooler nights which happened the entire length of the trail and a pillow if I didn't need it for warmth. I highly recommend a good quality puffy!I had a pair of Nike Sandals for camp and next time would buy lighterweight camps shoes. They worked for what I needed though!I was given a bandana in Franklin, NC from Outdoor 76 outfitters and carried it as a towel and sweat rag the entire trail.I bought a buff in Harpers Ferry, WV to use as a bandana, neck warmer, towel and to keep bugs away. It was such a versatile piece of gear and one of my favorite items I carried.For rain gear, all I had was a Frogg Togg poncho. Cheap and Light it did fairly well covering my body and pack but like any rain gear it's not perfect. It didn't do well in the wind and the snap buttons on the sides were terrible. I will look for a different pncho or rain system in the future.I had a bug net that I carried all the way from PA and didn't use until ME when I couldn't handle the bugs any longer.Medicine Bag:End: Hand Sanitizer, Ibuprofen, Tums, Body Glide, Foot Powder, Baby Wipes, Tweezers, KT Tape, Nail Clippers, Ben's 100 Deet, Toilet PaperI ended up cutting down a lot on medical equipment. Reality was, I didn't need to carry the weight and a lot of my other equipment could be used for the same purpose in emergencies-- (ex: clothing to stop bleeding/ splint). I carried extra weight in baby wipe and foot powder the whole way to take care of my feet every night. I would highly recommend it! I never used the KT tape and should have got rid of it but it stayed anyway!Electronics:Phone, Charging cords, Outlet Block with two USB outputs! (This is important!!), Ipod Shiffle and Headphones, 10,000 mAH Ankr Charger, AAA batteries, Petzl Head Lamp, SPOT Gen 3 GPSMost of this stuff stayed the same except I switched out portable chargers for the Ankr which gave me more charge. I had difficulty in the cold with my phone because it constantly turned off on me and drained the battery quickly. The dual USB charging block was crucial for when you only have a little time to charge whatever you can. It allows two of my three devices to charge as needed. The GPS was cool and nice to give family and friends piece of kind and also track my progress. The batteries were replacements for the GPS.Misc:Bic lighter + A few matches just in case!Montem Ultra Strong Trekking Poles (I loved these things. They are so much cheaper than most trekking poles, worked great and were adjustable. The locks for the adjustable height ended up rusting and breaking but they lasted the whole trail and the owner gave me a discount on a new pair after I finished. Cork is a must in my opinion for the handle of the trekking pole).2 Sea to Summit dry bags. One for food and one for clothes.AWOL Appalachian Trail Guidebook (Carried in sections rather than the whole book).Gear is so individualized. What works for me may not work for others. I learned a few things about backpacking gear:1. Nothing is waterproof.2. You don't need as much as you think.3. If you haven't used it in a week- you probably don't need it. (With a few exceptions).4. Sometimes the best gear is not the newest and shiniest. Don't stress about it too much and try the stuff you already have.Thanks for reading!",,View Entry,"Oct 01, Mon",0
