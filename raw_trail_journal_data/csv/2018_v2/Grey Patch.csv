Ate a frozen pizza for early dinner.  I forgot how good they could taste, or maybe I was just hungry.  First time since Saturday night that I had food that didn't take water to prepare.

Grey Patch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604971,"Woke up in Bly Gap (Mile 78) to another wet/cool day.  Had to pack up the tent etc. with quite a bit of wetness, hopefully I can make it to a shelter before nightfall so I can get it hung out to dry.   It was cool so I made good time hiking, had to keep moving to stay warm, by the afternoon things had warmed up enough where only one jacket was needed to stay warm...
In an earlier post I mentioned falling, well I got the first fall out of the way, nearly face planted.   The good old shoulder took the blunt of the fall, nothing hurts except the pride:).   Lucky me no rocks got in the way and I managed to stay on the footpath, 75% of the time so far the width of the trail is big enough for one person and trail etiquette dictates the person going uphill has the right of way.
Spent the night at Standing Indian Shelter (mile 85.7).    Picture is of the actual trail as it turns to the right of the big rock.","Bly's Gap

Staying at Carter Gap Shelter tonight, seen 3 waterfalls on the hike today.   Did 7.6 miles today which is good for me, would really like to be up to 2 mph..next trip I will be:)...","Standing Indian Shelter

Grey Patch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605018,"Rain day and I am too old/cold to be hiking in it, it was nice hiking in the rain when the temps were higher - something to offset the perspiration.. the first time I hiked when it was cooler in the rain it took me three hours to warm up.  When I was first planning this I figured that my time would be limited by the cooler weather and it appears to be approaching faster by a few weeks than what I had expected.  The temps will be below freezing for the next few mornings and then a few warmer days and then a chance of snow a week and half out.....I've started  evaluating what my strategy will be getting back home, more to follow in the next day or two.","

Grey Patch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605120,"Cold weather arrived a few weeks early than I had hope for, made the decision to call my adventure complete. My main object was to test my gear & ability in preparation for a future thru hike, a few more gear tweaks and mental, physical prep and I should be good. Only big surprised that I had was the issue of physical nourishment while on the trail, I knew that I wasn't getting enough calories but the amount of weight lost really surprised me. I had read how most hikers are not hungry the first week but than the ""hungry mode"" kicks in, I do believe this had started happening. A big thanks to Benton MacKaye for having a vision ""The trail was conceived by Benton MacKaye, a forester who wrote his original plan—called ""An Appalachian Trail, A Project in Regional Planning""[11]—shortly after the death of his wife in 1921. MacKaye's idea detailed a grand trail that would connect a series of farms and wilderness work/study camps for city-dwellers."" that has brought joy to thousands.","Franklin, NC
