Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559955,"Setting up journals, remembering (and writing down) different logins and passwords seems to be the order of the month. I am going to approach the wonderful organization that provided my cancer treatment and see if we can co-op on my AT thru hike. I am setting up various web impressions so that I can send my updates and personal thoughts, these being in addition to Trailjournals which I will post to as well. While I would classify myself as somewhat more then a novice in all this, the farther I go the more outside assistance I need. I'll keep you all posted on my efforts!",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Thu",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561054,"Been reading and following some 2017 hikers on Trail Journals that match my demographic group; same approximate age, level of experience hiking and starting date (my projected start date is Mar 17, 2018). It is interesting how they view hiking through Georgia and the differences in hiking alone or with partners. Some of these guys I follow are really moving- one guy hiked 28 out of 32 days and hit Hot Springs within 30! It seems that solo hikers certainly average more miles per day then group hikers-also they go to bed earlier (hiker's midnight) and wake earlier. The more info I can receive about real life experiences on the AT seems to make me more confident in my abilities to plan and execute. I hope!!",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Fri",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562854,"Boy the new website presence is very slick and a big improvement. I popped on a couple days ago and functionality seems to improve daily-Nice! The creator/owner of Trail Journals is a guy named Leif and he does this site kind of part time so he deserves a huge shout out for the new changes. If you poke around the site you can find out his contact info-it would be nice to send some kudo's his way.As far as planning goes this is the problem with having so much time until next March rolls around; while there is much to do, most of the fun and interesting  stuff doesn't start until about 60 days out. So for the next 2 weeks I am planning my physical training to get into trail shape and my shakedown hikes, starting at 3 hour hikes and moving on to 3 day overnight AT hikes as we move to fall and winter. It is very cold and wet from March to late April on the AT and I want to be ready for it. I also want to be able to set up my tent and household in about 15 minutes-right now it takes me 15 minutes just to put my REI tent's frame sticks together. Not good. The training program is less complicated-even though I just finished chemo and cancer treatment last month, I worked hard throughout my treatments to stay in shape. I weigh within 6 pounds of what I did when I started chemo and have continued to ride my bike and run on the beach. There have been some side effects to my body that I am sure will go away over time, now that chemo has stopped. Anyone reading my blog have any questions entering cancer treatment or about what to expect are welcome to contact me through trail journals-there is a lot of great technical info out there but very little anecdotal, or testimonial information on what the treatment FEELS like. Think my next entry will be some of my gear that I am acquiring at a alarming pace-got to keep it to 30 lbs that's my goal!!",,View Entry,"May 03, Wed",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569626,"I have discovered in my pre-planning that so much of life CAN'T be adjusted, delayed, cancelled or otherwise changed just because I plan on checking out of society for 6+ months. Pretty rude of the world, don't you think? Have done some travelling recently, mostly for pleasure and some for business, and have discovered the world is not nearly excited about my adventures and bucket list check offs as I am.  Now my future partner in our thru hike endeavor, my daughter Gillian has virtually completed her pre-hike planning. You may remember (but only if you have been following me) that I said my daughter is a National Park Ranger at Wrangell-St Elias National Park in Alaska. And because of her extensive backcountry experience and extended solo camping trips throughout the country, I think she feels the hike will be 'a piece of cake' to complete.I think not. Camping out and solo camping, even on extended 4 or 5 days is nothing compared to daily hiking becoming your job.  And that is exactly what it is-hiking every day, usually rain or shine for 7-10 hours a day takes real commitment. And training. And discipline. And waking up early (she won't be happy) and going to bed at hiker midnight (6 or 7 pm-the time she usually goes out). But when all is said and done and I quit talking like a Dad, she is much closer to getting her life put together for the hike then I.  Of course all she had to do is tell her Park Supervisor she was taking a sabbatical to hike the AT.  This news was met with much admiration and acceptance from all of her fellow rangers and a few 'let's do the PCT when you come back'. That's was it-all done with pre-planning for her!! Only thing left was getting her Mom to be her support leader (pay her bills, meet up with her at 8 predetermined spots on the trail, manage her monies and help her update her journals and social media, send her resupplies and replacements, and FACETIME on Sunday's @7:00pm every week). Now who is going to be MY support leader??  I had not even reached the point where I had a planned out these exercises. Who is going to be my go to support person-who is going to pick me up in NC to take me to our cabin and then bring me back the next day? Send me new Merrell's when I need some? Good thing I have 8 months to figure this all out!",,View Entry,"Jun 23, Fri",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572378,"Tipperary, Wildebeest, Daddy Long legs, First Sgt, El Vago. Salesman has thru hiked! Well done!!  The trail names of my partners; my partners being the elite of the Class of 2017 that are crowding around Maine as we speak, eager to seal the deal. As in all done. No more mail drops, no more nero's, zero's, no more AYCE buffets. Their goal is in sight, the final ascent to Katahdin which sounds like a hellacious hike in its own rite. I have followed these guys from their first day--mostly mid February to mid March--and here we are 125-150 days in to their hikes they are preparing to finish. I have envisioned myself as them these 4+ months, wondering if I could be as tough and dedicated as they have been to their hikes.  These guys were serious; they took very few zero days, hiking over 90 miles a week average.  This is way more then most of us on the sidelines can visualize-looking through the trail journals stats most folks average 60-75 miles a week. In the end the big difference is this group started earlier then most--they moved ahead of the so called bubble of hikers that start for the most part in mid March to mid April. Easier to find vacant shelters, less flies and bugs (until Maine) and overall more pleasant hiking weather with less humidity. Smart guys I say. Oh and they were also lucky-very few injuries (but a lot of falls).
Their completing their hikes also means something else-batter up!! I and my fellow 2018 wannabe's need to step up, gear up and get in the game.  Most of my fellow 2018 hikers that I read journals of seem to be well into their preparation phase. Me, well not too much. More on that in my next post",,View Entry,"Jul 18, Tue",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573685,"Scary stuff happens when hikers get close to Katahdin. Thru hikers get worn down from daily bumps and bruises, cuts, bites and strains. From reading journals of others still on the trail, it seems the trail gets less forgiving as well. Not as many high mountains to climb but more technical and difficult hiking awaits everyone from the Whites onward.  Both IPA and Daddy Long Legs have sustained catastrophic injuries in the final stages of their hikes recently, both probably requiring orthopedic surgeries to repair. Both of these hikers were experienced. They knew the terrain they were entering (Maine, New Hampshire) was tough going. And here I am trying to put this all in prospective for my hike in 2018. Yikes!!It appears that continuing to try to hike 17-20 miles a day with 100+ days of wear and tear on your body makes no sense. Hikers trying to finish early (Mid July to Mid August finishes are early) seem to push high mileage days at any expense. There is no comparison with walking 20 miles in Virginia compared to 20 miles in Maine. I definitely need to revisit my daily mileage estimates for the last 500 miles of the trail.",,View Entry,"Jul 31, Mon",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576005,"Just returned back to my home in Melbourne Beach from a wonderful 10 day visit to our family cabin in WNC.  And while I was in that neck of the woods as they say, I decided to get a little first hand knowledge of what hiking on the Appalachian Trail is really all about. After all it will be my home for 130+ days next year.  You see my cabin is deep in the Nantahala National Forest near Hayesville and Franklin in NC.  Sitting at 2200 feet and within 30 minutes of not only the great AT but also just a few miles from Wayah, Wesser and Siler Balds, this is a hiker's paradise. And the ultimate training ground for my thru hike next year; right out my door I will be able to do day, overnight and multi day hikes and prepare mentally and physically.  So without further ado I will proceed to tell you some of what I have learned about the great AT now that I have actually experienced hiking and camping on it for the past week. Here we go:
#1- There are an ungodly amount of up's and down's on the trail. I mean every 2 miles you are either ascending or descending from or to either a road, gap or river and spring crossing.  And whenever you come to a road or gap, you are most definitely going to descend what seems to be at least 300-500 feet. Quickly. And when you return to the trail, up you go. Quickly again. To give you an example (pull out your maps if you got them) just hiking out from Rock Gap Shelter Mile 109 (NC) south on the AT to Glassmine Gap you immediately climb 600 feet in elevation in the first 1/5 mile.  Folks trust me, that's a big, quick climb. Hard to visualize I know, but good gosh it will get the heart pumping in a flash. And then down 200 feet. And repeat.
#2-The trail really earns its name of the 'green tunnel'. In the mountains, it is very narrow and dark below tree line and has millions of roots and rocks every ten feet (more on that later). You really need to concentrate on where you are going all the time-head down and look at the next 10 feet in front of you. 
#3-You must have a keen joy in solitude and silence and contemplation because if you are hiking alone, boy the woods are quiet. I mean you can hear an occasional bird call but that's about it. Just you, your thoughts and bugs. A lot of bugs. I will hike this area in the winter next year and will experience virtually none then, but for the summer months, this area is bug central. Do not forget your DEET. Ever.
#4-You are going to get wet. No matter where you are-in a shelter, tent or hammock or hiking with a pack cover and rain gear and gaiters and a poncho-you will get wet and for the most part, stay wet for the rest of the day. It rains so heavily and without let up for hours at a time.  I read journals and I always hear how you just have to live with the rain and by gosh, they are not kidding. Cannot stay dry on the trail-you may dry out eventually but get used to it-you will be wet again tomorrow. 
#5-I may very well be medevac off the AT next year. Perhaps multiple times. I am really worried about this.  You see I'm one of those handful of people that are categorized as being a klutz.  If there is a kitchen cabinet door open I'll hit it with my head. And bleed. I trip over rugs that have been in the same place for 10 years. Dogs and cats that have been underfoot for ever, I'm tripping or kicking them along their way.  I rarely get seriously hurt mind you, but if there is an obstacle anywhere around I'll eventually tangle with it.  Now here is my issue-the AT is chock full of roots, rocks and blowdowns that cover virtually every square foot.  In just the 5 days I was out on the AT here is my tally: Slight stumble-18    Full-out stumble and Near Fall-7 FOMB-0. I have a feeling that last category may have a number on it when I get out here for real.  I am seriously thinking about a daily running count added to my daily journal of my klutzy-ness when hiking-something like Daily Trip and Stumble report.",,View Entry,"Aug 24, Thu",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577352,Took a few moments the  other day to post my current gear I plan to use on my thru hike in March. I have since bought more (it is an addiction) and will update soon.,,View Entry,"Sep 09, Sat",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578129,"So I'm down in my house in Melbourne Beach and look who is coming for a visit? Hurricane Irma is scaring the bejesus out of everyone, especially the local authorities so the decision was made to evacuate the island (Melbourne Beach, Cocoa Beach, Vero Beach and Satellite Beach are all on an island, connected to the mainland by causeways). So off we go me, my wife and our two dogs all loaded in our Jeep and headed for our cabin in WNC. After 14 hours (should have been 9) with all the other evacuees, we arrive and I decide since the hurricane is way behind us (crossing the Key's) this would be a fine time for me to take an overnight hike and shakedown some of my new stuff!! My wife who from this point forward will be referred to as the saint because she is one, agreed to drop me off at Deep Gap and pick me up the next day at Winding Stair Gap. Total distance was 25.5 miles and she dropped me off on Sunday morning with plans to pick me up Monday at 2pm. These locations are all on the AT (I know most of you have maps) in NC.  They include some of the highest elevations on the trail in NC. Which means big ups immediately followed by big downs. Yup I could have picked an easier area on the AT to hike, but I decided to make this a shakedown hike for equipment and physical readiness. And the results are in!!!
I'm not ready.
It is very unforgiving out there. The AT does not play. Started on Sunday @11am with 12.3 miles to hike before I hit my camping area, Betty Gap. The first 2.5 miles took me from 3700 feet to 5400 feet to the top of Standing Indian. Tough but I got thru it well, stopped a few times for a minute or 2 to let my respiration catch up to my heart rate. Cannot believe I smoked for 25 years-I definitely have  reduced lung capacity and you feel it going up. By 615pm I reached Betty Gap. Except it was closed. Until 2018!! My only choice was to push ahead and stealth camp off the trail in a flat spot. Found an area about 300 yards up the trail, pitched my new tent and footprint in 9 minutes (kind of quick) and prepared to cook dinner. Only the wind was blowing and it started to rain lightly (uh oh) so I decided I was hitting the rack and would make a big meal in the morning when it was not raining and blowing. Here comes 7am and it is blowing about 20-30 mph with driving rain and while I'm dry inside I'm not sure I can cook in this weather. Or stand.  Where exactly is that hurricane? No cell service, over 12 miles to a road and 13 miles to my pick up point and it is 730am-I need to hike right now. Oh and the closet shelter is 8 miles away. Immediately I am faced with 1300 feet up in 1.2 miles to reach Alfred Mountain and its fire tower. It was the TOUGHEST 1 mile I have EVER hiked in my life. Ridiculous winds with a driving rain, 28lb pack and ledges and rocks and roots (those of you who have been there know about the last 400 feet) and 1.25 hours later I reached the tower. No views just rain and the winds were picking up. After a quick look around I was off. The next 6 miles was all downhill, easier but not easy in these conditions.
I finally reached Long Branch shelter and got some cell service-the saint informed me that winds extended out 300 miles north (uh oh again) and had I checked the weather before, I would know all this. Well hikes like this build character and illustrate that I have what it takes to make it, I say. Then I begged her to meet me a half hour earlier then we planned cause I'm flying down the mountain to get out of this weather. And I haven't eaten since yesterday morning at 730am. And I'm ready to go home. And get out of these wet clothes. 
I think it is time I work on the mental side of my thru hike though.",,Winding Stair Gap,"Sep 20, Wed",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580254,"Someone has been real lax about posting trail prep for 2018. I really am having a hard time breaking out my time on the trail of late; I have been trail training and overnight hiking for the last 3 months and haven't written one blog note or entry  I have been hiking the North Georgia-North Carolina portion of the AT most of the time, having covered the area from Plumorchard Gap to Winding Stair pretty regularly. Its only about a 35 mile stretch but has some real tough and quick ascents and steep downs that give you a good mix of what the first 250 miles of the AT will be like. 
I feel real good about my conditioning and ability to handle the trail; I certainly feel ready to hike for 8 hours a day starting out. I made that my first goal to achieve pre-hike. It really doesn't matter how many miles I can hike in the 8 hours starting out.  On all my practice hikes I hike a minimum of 6 to 9 hours a day with an average of 13 to 22 miles a day. I think this more then anything else will allow me some time to develop some decent trail legs before leaving North Carolina.
My next goal is proficiently in setting up daily housekeeping on the trail. If I don't practice cooking and setting up my stove I will starve by Hiawassee. Got to have my morning joe or the rest of the day will be real crappy!",,View Entry,"Nov 05, Sun",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580551,"Like most future thru hikers, I subscribe to about 30 hiking blogs and numerous individual journals. Every day my email is full of equipment, clothes and folks thoughts on training for the big hike. Just this morning I had 32 emails awaiting me; 25 from AT types. Jeez folks can we just calm down a bit?
I'm reading of guys and gals that are taking 5 day, 80 miles training hikes. A few are training by hiking the Shenandoah from end to end. Experimenting to get your pack weight below 16 lbs including the Big 3 (Ounce Weenies are fun to follow. Ridiculous, but fun) One guy is hiking Mt Washington (New Hampshire) on a weekly basis, up and down in order to get into shape for the trail.  What happened to the thinking that once you get on the trail you will get your trail legs in a few weeks?  I find it hard to believe that constant hard hiking/training is going to help you not twist an ankle, get shin splits or suffer from foot issues once on the trail. Hike with a loaded pack for a weekend jaunt or two or three, yes. Become familiar with setting up and breaking down your house and cooking in all types of weather, yes. Constantly tinkering with your equipment and getting your clothing wardrobe right (so very important!) definitely yes. Being diligent in getting your temple (body) in better respiratory shape in order to handle the PUP (pointless ups and downs) that you experience the first 200 miles, yes yes. Hell my cabin is practically on the AT in NC and I would never consider training as much as these guys do!
I'm ready. As ready as I ever will be. Got all my gear and clothes. I too, have AWOL's AT Guide, ALDHA's Companion, GUTHOOK on my IPhone and numerous TOPO maps of the South Appalachian part of the trail. I have read them all, planned my entire trip with Postholer~ zero's, nero's and resupply stops (btw all this pre-planning is just an exercise in futility ultimately. Weather alone can change this plan within days of your start. But it does give you something to do in the time being). Don't get me wrong, I'm still out there training. Stairmaster. Lunges around the gym (kill me please) Doing some medium weight squats on the rack. All on a semi-regular basis. It's enough, more then enough. I'm 63 I don't want to drop dead before I get on the trail for real. After all is said and done-I want the trail to offer me some surprises and mysteries. It's why I hike.",,View Entry,"Nov 15, Wed",0
Michael Braver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581877,"Long time, no see! Yeah its been awhile since I posted and so much has changed it is difficult to know where to start and where to finish. I know there are many (One maybe) who have followed my posts and for you folks, I will proceed to get you all caught up.

Can't do the hike this year. 2018 is not the year I hoped it would be, hiking-wise.  In order to thru-hike much support is needed by those we leave behind; wives, children, dogs and cats. In my case 2017 brought too many changes at home for me to hike with a good feeling of what I left at home. My wife's job in her industry (Medical Sales/Capitol Sales Executive) evaporated during the fall, and she began a similar position with a different company this winter. However her territory area and responsibilities changed as well, which means we may have to make decisions on selling our Florida home at the beach and purchasing another more centrally located for her. Maybe buy one in Atlanta. Or maybe we will rent it or lease it for the season or air bnb or blah blah blah. You get the idea~either way she will not be able to work her job, make house decisions and be my off trail support so.....stay home I will! Life goes on.
In addition to the above my daughter who is a US Park Ranger and was to be my partner in the hike,  got offered at great full time job at a much higher GS level in Alaska so she decided she would only be able to section hike for a month this year. Maybe 2019 for her. Not counting on that though. Life goes on.

That's a wrap-ALL THE BEST TO MY FELLOW 2018 THRU-HIKERS-many of which I met and chatted with on this site. I will be watching your blogs, bitches and successes.
Also Thanks to Leif for all the good things this site is-we all need to paypal some change to him every once in a while for all he does",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Fri",0
