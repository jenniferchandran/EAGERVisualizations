Stopped at Dahlgren Backpacker Campground for a shower and to charge all my devices. Saw the original Washington Mounument with a beautiful view. I missed the shelter I wanted to stay at and ended up doing more miles then I planned. My backpack is super heavy. Unloading a bunch of unnecessary items tonight.

Crossed the Mason Dixie Line. Went into Blue Ridge Summit for my first resupply. First trail magic. First a women stopped and gave me a lift back from town back to the trail. She told me she had just done the same for two other hikers. She said her goal was to retire in 3 years and thru hike the trail herself. Then, even better trail magic, my cousin Jeramiah showed up at my campsite tonight with pizza and beer!!

Stayed at a beautiful campground, Caledonia State Park. I met a nice couple that told me all about their camping days. Now they have a camper so they can take their 11 year old retriever with them. I chatted with the campground host for quite a while. She was very interested in learning how my hike was going so far. I got a nice shower and was able to charge up all my devices.

It was loud and very close with big chucks of hail. The two other couples were both northbounders that started in Georgia. Got some good tips from them on trail life and good places to go once I start heading south. I slept in the shelter, which was not fun.

I meet up with the couples I stayed with at the shelter last night at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store where they have the ""half gallon challenge"". Hikers celebrate crossing the half way mark by eating a whole half gallon of ice cream. Three of the four hikers had said they were going to do it the night before but due to the cold weather they all changed their minds. We all ate lunch and the food was excellent. My feet were feeling better but I stopped early again because they were calling for thunderstorms again. The rest were pushing on for seven more miles to the next shelter.

I also saw two tiny bright orange lizards on the trail and a turtle. Stayed at another small unofficial campsite all by myself again. My gear is slowly beginning to dry out.

It’s a barn on the caretakers property and a tentsite in a field across the street. There’s a solar shower and the caretaker lets you use his electricity to charge your devices.

After that the trail went thru a part that looked like a wasteland due to zinc contamination in the area a long time ago. The rest of the day the trail was lush and green and level.

A trail angel gave me a ride into town. Water is very scarce in this section of the trail so she was passing out bottled water too. Trail angels are amazing!! I had a late lunch/early dinner at the Cafe on Broadway. A very hiker friendly place. They filled up my water bottles for free and let me charge up my devices. Had a hot, steep climb out of town.

The church hostel we stayed at put on a dinner for us hikers for free. Fried chicken, hot dogs, corn on the cob and much more. It was so nice. We hung out and chatted with the people from the church. They were very interested to here our stories. I decided to stay at the hotel next to the hostel that night because a lot of the hikers were sick and I didn’t want to catch it. The hotel had a live jazz band in the restaurant/bar. A group from the hostel came over and we hung out for a while.

It’s made out of material that a bear can’t get into. So you can tie it up anywhere on a tree and it should be fine. Well, this morning when I went to retrieve my bag I found that a bear had tried very hard to get into it. There were claw and bite marks all over it. The bag worked in that the bear couldn’t get at the food, however in its effort to open it he smashed all the contents into essentially one big ball of granola, tuna fish and peanut butter :-p. So I hiked 16 miles to Branchville, the next town. According to the Google there was an Econo Lodge a half mile off the trail and a grocery store a mile further. Perfect! When I got there though it turned out the Econo Lodge was actually 10 miles away. So instead I found a campground 4 miles away and called an Uber to pick me up. At the campground I chatted with the owners for quite awhile. They were very interested in my hike. They introduced me to a woman staying there whose husband was also hiking to trail.

There were several climbs and descents today but nothing too steep. There were a lot a beautiful views, at Sunrise Mountain peak and from an observation tower at the highest point in New Jersey.

I ordered a new stove and shipped it to a town a few days away. I ate lunch with a few fellow hikers at the local tavern and hiked the remaining 6 miles to the shelter.

I got some heartbreaking news from home today. My Grandpa Jerry passed away this morning. While it was not unexpected, it is still a shock.

He brought snacks, pop, water and beer. He meet a handful of very grateful hikers :). He even met someone who is a big Lucero fan!!
Slackpacking is awesome :). What a difference! The miles flew by. My knee held up just fine. Thanks to a much lighter load on my back. The trail followed the Housatonic River for several miles m. Beautiful views :).  I leap frogged with a northbounder named Sunshine all day. She showed up as Matt was picking me up. We gave her a beer and a snickers and chatted for a while.

And I crossed into state number 7, Massachusetts. The last four miles were all downhill, with the last mile being extremely steep. This was very hard on my sore knees! But the sight I had at the bottom of this hill was a beautiful thing! Matt and Ella Mae were there passing out food and drinks to hikers. Ella Mae bounded up the hill to greet me :). I sat and had a beer and a brat. Can you say spoiled?
While I was hiking Matt did trail magic all day. He saw lots of hikers that were very happy to see him! He told me stories of all the interesting people he met. We headed back to the campground. Crashed out pretty early because we were both tired .","US Route 44

I did get some trail magic though. Pop, cookies and chips. Matt was luckier than me. He did trail magic all day again and got to see at least one girl partially half naked ;-). He was right next to a major road though so luckily for him the boys put their clothes on before getting to him. I got to his spot around 2pm and stopped for the day.

I also got a salad from their salad bar and headed next door to the laundromat. I ate my salad and recharged my devices as I cleaned my clothes.

He was an extremely friendly guy and dropped me back to the trail. I hiked the short distance to the Inn and checked in. The place seemed nice and attached to an Irish Pub. The rooms were small, with no A/C though :(. After a nap, I went down to the pub for dinner. There I met two other flip flop hikers, Doser and Napper.

The hostel is only .4 miles off the trail on a main road. It’s a bar with a hostel up stairs and is actually run by the same people that own Doe River Hostel. Dave, the owner told me the hostel was all built by hikers doing work for stay. It’s a cool place. There were no other hikers staying tonight, just me. I settled in and picked up my packages. One was from home, Matt sent me a set of base layers to stay warmer at night and an orange vest I can attach to my backpack since it’s hunting season, and a Reese’s peanut butter cup ;-). The other package was a fleece liner for my sleeping bag. I think I’m ready for the cold now. I went down to the bar, had a few beers and some food. I chatted with the bartender, former AT hiker Crazy. A very interesting guy with lots of stories :).

Then it was several ups and downs in the Balds in the Roan Highlands. It was beautiful up there but I didn’t want to linger too long. It was too cold to not keep moving. I had planned to stay at the Roan Mountain Shelter however I stated reading the comments in my guide about it and it said that it was the highest, and coldest shelter on the AT. So instead I decided to make it a shorter day and found a very nice stealth spot down in a Gap by a stream. Hoping to stay out of the wind as much as possible. I tried to get a fire going but everything was too wet. So I ate dinner quickly and climbed into my hammock. I put on every piece of clothing I have and snuggled in.

The other is a guy from France that is traveling across the US. Another thru hiker came in this morning and taking a nero. We all went into town on the lunch shuttle and got KFC takeout. I had voted for Subway but was outvoted. I can’t remember the last time I had fried chicken. It was freaking delicious! Today is the anniversary of the day my dad died, 21 years ago. This day is always tough but with the recent death of my mom, who passed unexpectedly a month before I started this hike, today was a very emotional day for me.
