Omer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590938,"Miker and I got to Harpers Ferry visitor center about 8:15. Opens at 9.  Weather clear and COLD!! Wandered around checking historic plaques. Try to get our shuttle driver to come early but ignoring us. Shows up right at 10. 1 hour drive to Pen Mar Park. Still COLD. Little bit of rain. At Pen Mar all facilities still closed for winter, i.e. bathrooms. Snapped some pics and got on trail around 11:30a. Nice wide, smooth trail for 200 yards and then white blaze go 2 different ways! Think this must be the High Rock Loop trail. Turned left op hill and climbed up ridge. Now we’re into rocks like I’ve read about in PA. This might be where AWOL sprained his ankle. 2 miles in passed 12 or so boy scouts and leaders heading to Ensign Cowell Shelter (10 mi.).  Same as us. First thought is to stay ahead of them to secure shelter space (my selfish self still needs work)! 5 miles in stopped for quick lunch at Raven Rock Shelter. Starting to snow. This one is not on the ATC Interactive Map but in AWOL’s guide. More scouts here. They spent the night after short hike from road. Friendly leaders so we hung here awhile. Beautiful, new 2 tier shelter built in 2010. Got tour of hammock setups for winter camping. Pretty sweet but I think I’ll stick to tent and shelters. Enjoyed their fire. 1.8 miles stopped at Warner Gap Hollow stream to filter and snack. Passed a few NOBO scouts looking for the group we passed. Found some crazy looking old iron equipment in the woods. Couldn’t figure out what it was. Onward to ECS.  Got in around 5pm.  Found Jim (Paul w Bunions) sleeping in shelter. Lots of scouts already there. Fortunately they were all tent camping. Disgusting but functional privey (Jim: ""5’ of sh** in a 4’ hole""). Just enough water in stream to filter. Jim had nice fire going. He likes to talk! Many trail and personal stories, opinions, a poem, you name it. He’s from PA and lost his machinist job after 9/11, started hiking and fell in love with the AT. Said he’s worked his way up and down the AT doing odd jobs (work for stay & minimal pay) and also teaches apprentice machinist when possible.  Real friendly guy who likes hanging with hikers/talking to people. Nothing wrong w that. Lots of AT trail knowledge. Cold that night! Happy for feet warmers and J-Boy’s sleeping bag but still restless (first night out). Takes me a LONG time to settle (squirmin’, adjusting, zipping, arranging…). All in all a good first day!",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Sat",0
Omer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590941,"Once your up and moving doesn’t seem as cold.  Made oatmeal, coffee, packed up, filtered water and hit the trail about 9:15a. Feel good other than feet being a little sore. Miker starting to develop blisters. We soon realized that if a shelter is near a water source it’s probably in a valley which means the first mile of the day will be a climb up to the ridge line. Pacing is key for these climbs, especially first thing. Once we got up on the ridge above Wolfsville Rd we stopped so M could work on his feet. Bad blisters that needed popping and treatment. Sterilized pin, Neosporin, bandaids and Leukotape patched him up. After that, nice easy hike to Pogo Mem. Campsite for lunch. Today’s Sunday so lot of day hikers around going to Black Rock Cliffs (awesome views to west) and Annapolis Rocks which we had heard about the day before. We avoided AR since, 1) .5 mile out of the way, 2) crowds, 3) hikers told us Black Rock was better views and right on the trail.  Downhill off ridge and to Pine Knob Shelter (fortunately a little off AT trail so quiet) for break/snack then back to hiking for 3.5 miles to Washington Monument (the original). Pretty cool spot. Went up the tower for the view (and wind) then short hike down to the park for 1 last break, call home and porta-john (full facilities still closed). Left park around 5:30p and promptly lost the trail (briefly). Hiked for 1.5 mi and crossed Turner’s Gap Road where there’s an Inn and restaurant.  Thought about shower, bed, nice meal but bit my tongue.  Came to Dahlgren Campground where I first wanted to stop and bit my tongue again. We both knew that if we wanted to finish tomorrow/Monday we had to make it another 2 miles to Rocky Run Shelter(s). There are actually 2.  After such a long day we were both tired  and hungry and a little delirious (at least me).  Near Dahlgen’s I had to stop and suck down a Gu packet to keep my energy up. We tried to keep each other going by singing tunes: Paul Simon, Beatles, Sublime, Stones, even John Denver! We would alternate lines and if we didn’t know the next line would make something up.  Paul Simon’s Kathy’s Song ended up having some bizarre (but profound) verse about the “special tincture” of something. Should have written that one down. That kept us cracking up for a good ¼ mile.  
At the end of this beat down day, tired, confused and not thinking straight we somehow added an unnecessary ½ mile to our hike by mis-interpreting the directions to the older shelter. This made both of us a little grumpy (short lived).  It’s easy to get mad at yourself when you focus on a screw up that causes more pain. Have to chalk all these up and stay positive. We mostly did.

Met 2 younger guys doing similar hike to ours that were in the nice new shelter. They were only doing about 7 miles per day. All of us are worried about storm coming in Tuesday.  They are also going to Harper’s Ferry but one guy doubts he can do the 15 miles in one day. (NOTE: they left a little before us Monday am but we never saw them.  Either they stayed ahead of us (very possible) or bailed out early and got a ride (I think they bailed!). 

We ended up staying by ourselves in the much older 6 man shelter close to the water. Nice firepit w/2 heavy metal chairs someone hauled in.  Sweet! Felt warmer that night or maybe just getting used to the cold. Stayed up looking at the stars and wondering what lights in woods were (tent campers). Slept pretty well. Nice privey here, good water.

No mice so far.  Too cold. Another good but tiring day!",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Sun",0
Omer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590944,"On the trail around 9:30a. Again, am climb first thing.  We stopped at Lambs Knoll tower road at top of hill to de-layer. Monday looked like another beautiful day to hike: sunny w/temps in the 50s. While there we met our first NOBO thru-hiker (didn’t get his name – DOH!). He looked to be in mid-20s, fit, clean, organized and not ultra-lite. Said he started Feb 1 at Springer Mt.  That means 1151 miles in 47 days, an avg of 24.5 mi/day! Assuming he takes a zero day every 7-8 days then he’s actually hiking 29-30 miles/day! Seems like he’s the first one of the season.  Said he wasn’t seeing any other NOBOs. Wish I knew if he made it.
Pushing south on Monday we took lunch, rested, called home, etc. at Gathland State Park. Bathrooms again closed but clean porta-john and good spigot water. Historic Civil War site w/cool old buildings and ruins. 10 miles to go to Harpers Ferry so have to keep moving! A mile or two out of Gathland and mother nature is calling (w/some urgency). Ed Garvey Shelter less than 2 miles ahead so I should be fine, right? As we get closer it seems more and more like someone has moved Ed Garvey!! Are we there yet? No.  Are we there yet? No. I’m getting desperate and just know I’m going to head for a tree and then Ed Garvey will be right around the next bend.  My song for the day becomes, “Ed Garvey, Ed Garvey oh where have you gone?” (and some other more colorful lyrics). I was literally talking out loud to my body trying to convince it to settle down, that EG was right around the corner.  That was definitely the longest mile (or ½ mile) that I’ve ever hiked.  Finally made it, flung off my pack and thanked Ed Garvey and all AT privy builders/maintainers.  Nice view so hung there (shelter, not privy) for a bit then back at it.  We had strategically filled 2L of water (normally we only carried 1L) since we didn’t want to hike down a steep 0.4 mile blue blaze trail for water at EG and there is no other source until you get to HF.

Soon after EG we started the steep decent to the Potomac River valley. With no leaves on the trees (plenty on the trail hiding rocks, roots, etc.) we had good views of the river. Miker’s feet/knees really bothering him so went slow. Downhill is the worse! Finally made it to Weaverton Rd and rested.  Offered to call Uber from there but M said no way, we were finishing! Made our way to Canal Towpath trail (getting lost once) and did the long, painful slog (3.5 mi) to the Byron Mem footbridge over the Potomac and into WV (almost heaven…). Took some pics in HF historic district waiting for Uber. Back to car and then decided not to hang around HF but drive right to M’s due to incoming storm. 

Done! 41 miles of trail (43 miles w/all side trips and missteps). Really glad we did this warm-up hike prior to the big hike in May.",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Mon",0

Omer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592208,"ok we've started. Tech wise only brought my iPhone. Finding doing entries a little cumbersome so may not do too many. Nice easy hike to start and stayed dry until we got to shelter then it poured. Great time with weekend hikers Matt, Amy, Russell, Sky and Marshall the dog.","Springer Mountain
