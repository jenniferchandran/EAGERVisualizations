LiveFree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584171,"I'm four days out from beginning one of the biggest adventures in my life.  I sit here in my in-laws' living room kicked back on an over stuffed leather lounge chair contemplating how I arrived at this point in my life.  Multiple children, all under the age of six, bustle about accompanied by the sounds and energy of them playing, laughing, asking for snacks, and a couple needing the proverbial diaper change.  Almost appropriately, the History Channel show ""The Men Who Built America:  Frontiersmen"" plays in the background.  This particular episode is about Daniel Boone.  It only further fuels to my interest in this upcoming excursion- both because of my love for this country, the outdoors, and the opportunity to break ranks from mainstream society and experience something amazingly unique.  
While registering with the ATC for this hike a couple days ago, one of the questions asked on the website was ""Why?""  Why thru-hike the Appalachian Trail?  I hastily listed the following:  ""Bucket List:  Adventure; Transition in Life; Determine my Future""
I'm hiking this 2,190.9 miles over the next six months, starting on Sunday (18MAR18).  The ""approach trail"" for this excursion started decades ago.  I loved growing up in New Hampshire and taking summer trips into the White Mountains to both hike and trout fish the crystal clear rock-bottomed streams.  During my college years, my family took a road-trip to L.L. Beans in Freeport, Maine and I bought a book about a retired Army colonel who thru-hiked the AT and that brought my awareness to a new level.  Over the next twenty-plus years, I mentally planned for this occasion.  The desire remained but the reason(s) for this undertaking evolved from my 20 year-old self to where I am now...married, multiple children, retiring from a 20-plus year career, and moving from a home we've known for the past three years.  The Bucket List reasons listed above apply without a doubt...but so does the opportunity to reflect...actually take time to THINK, find peace of mind, and ultimately determine my family's future.  Does this require six months?  I'm not sure- I'll be sure to let you know!",,Mount Katahdin,"Mar 14, Wed",0
LiveFree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584172,"Admittedly, I have done very little preparation- which is (also admittedly) very counter to my Type A personality and despite the length of time I've looked forward to this trip.  Nonetheless, other priorities overtook my resources...namely my time.
As my wife and I got ready to have our most recent child this past fall, I put the idea of actually tackling the thru-hike on the back-burner and excitedly looked forward to the birth.  A couple weeks after giving birth, my wife amazed me (yet again) by telling me she believed this transition period was still our best opportunity for me to thru-hike the AT.  Another week passed and my father-in-law visited us to meet his new grandchild.  During his visit, he asked if he could be my hiking partner.  He moved his own retirement up about one full year, he was hiking 2-3 hours a day with a 35-pound pack, and had lost 30 pounds over the previous six months.  Talk about dedication!  His commitment re-ignited my own fire.
My own last major hike was Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania over 15 years ago.  Technology and gear have come a long way and I realized my own knowledge was certainly dated.  I began listening to numerous audio books on thru-hiking the AT and purchased a small library of resources from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.  These books included the AT Thru-Hike Planner, Data Book, and Thru-Hikers' Companion.  Despite my relatively short timeline, and in an attempt to lessen the sticker shock of acquiring new hiking/camping equipment, I did some hasty on-line research but ultimately heavily relied upon the REI ""easy button.""  I trust their products, their employees, and their service.  I largely capitalized on sales when possible and in particular their ""Garage Sale"" items.  
My father-in-law and I conducted a shake-out overnight hike Thanksgiving weekend in Uwharrie National Forest.  The weather was crisp but beautiful and we familiarized ourselves with our equipment.  Quick lessons learned included water supply/hydration (including during cold/cool weather), packing sequence (order of what is where in your pack), and of course situational awareness (knowing where you are located in space and time).  We were gaining momentum!",,Mount Katahdin,"Mar 14, Wed",0

I first have to thank my incredibly kind/ helpful brother and sister-in-law for making today’s drive with us so we didn’t have to fly and shuttle into the park.
We made the 4 1/2 hour drive to Amacalola Falls State Park, took a brief but informative pre-hike class from Ridgerunner Nick (Trailname Master-splinter) at the visitors center.
We checked into the lodge (actually staying in a cabin to enjoy one final night in a full-sized bed and morning shower).  
We chowed down on pizza and lounged for an hour by the campfire...clear and cool with a stream (or creek down South) running about 30 feet away.  Soooo relaxing!
Tomorrow morning will arrive in no time and the journey begins!",,Mount Katahdin,"Mar 17, Sat",0

I wrote birthday cards for some family and Easter cards for the kids on Day 8 / Sunday evening (25MAR18).  This further stoked my unsettled feelings of potentially being gone so long (and of my own volition).Day 9 / Monday (26MAR18) was a great day for hiking with extraordinary views.  We made it over Tray Mountain (4,430 ft) and camped at the shelter location.  I also let my father-in-law know I was ready to head home in a couple days.Day 10 / Tuesday (27MAR18) we pushed through an 11-mile day.  Good temp for hiking but chilly, damp, and foggy.  I was melancholy about my decision to come off the trail- but at peace with that decision.Day 11 / Wednesday (28MAR18) we shuttled from Hiawassee to Gainesville, GA.  Ms. Grace Rodgers is a wonderful retired lady who provides this service for a nominal fee in a seasonal capacity.  This began the true-life planes/trains/and automobile journey back to Kentucky.  We caught the Greyhound bus from Gainesville to Atlanta, then the MARTA train from the Garnett stop to the airport.  Both of these legs also broadened my horizon, and while we thankfully met several very kind and helpful people at each stage of the trip- it quickly reminded me how much I appreciate where I grew up and have lived since leaving home.We caught a flight from Atlanta through K.C. to Nashville and received my truck back from my sister and brother-in-law...then drove back home the remaining distance.I am putting this adventure “on pause.”  At different points, I had sore legs, knees, ankles- but thankfully nothing that was a show-stopper and I was actually building a good rhythm.  The people out there are amazing, diverse, and of almost every capability level you can imagine.  Many outdoor-lifestyle types (of course), but others not fitting neatly into that mold as well.  Many reasons, some missing limbs, and varieties of personalities.  Anyone can make an excuse, but it takes conviction and determination to make a decision.  Everyone shared the desire to be out there and this helped illustrate the real possibility of consistently seeing the best in humanity on an almost hourly basis.I look forward to going back someday and preferably sharing the adventure in conjunction with my family...especially as the kids get older.For now, however, I’m happy to take them on short fishing and camping trips and quite frankly- just spend time.  You see- the reality of being gone from them was different than the notion of it...and for me, especially because I now have a choice.Before going on the trip, I had a couple other friends with older children reinforce the fact that the impact of me being gone wouldn’t be significant on the kids (because of how young they are), the impact would only be on me.  At the time, those words were intended to reassure me it was ok.  Ultimately- I’m sitting here thankful I was back to see my kids scramble around looking for Easter eggs and tear into their Easter baskets.   That brief window in their development when they are excited about it and the magic still exists.  To sit in the lounge chair with each of them vying to snuggle up under my arms.   To look forward to my oldest starting slow-pitch baseball this summer- and actually be there for it.  To watch my youngest start crawling and maybe walk- not just hear about it.  The list could easily go on.Many thanks for those who supported my initial endeavor.  Apologies for this being cut short.  Belated Happy Easter!""","
