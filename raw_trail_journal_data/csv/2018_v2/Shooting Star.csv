Shooting Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549762,"I'm thrilled to be announcing to the world that I will begin my thru-hike in April 2018!We came off the trail in May 2013, and I regret that decision each time I recall it. It was a chore getting life to be on ""hold"" so we could hike last time, yet getting prepped to hike again has been even more challenging. My hike start is 18 months away! Time to automate bill pay, get a house and pet sitter, document routines for the house, yada yada yada. And hike!",,Making plans,"Sep 28, Wed",0
Shooting Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549801,"It's fall in New Hampshire. If you live in the northeast, you know that October is a busy month prepping a house and yard for coming snows. This year the list is expanded. We are having work done on the house and deciding whether or not to sell other real estate. Simplify. The bit of hiking we did in 2013 on AT taught me that simplicity is best. Our hike is 18+ months away, but that is no reason to postpone planning. Whatever issues we can resolve early on should make the last few months before heading out less stressful.","Making plans

Shooting Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550831,"Still making plans, still dreaming about getting back to hiking the AT in 2018. We are planning to hike the Long Trail this summer. I have heard that if you can finish the Long Trail in about 3 weeks, you are likely to finish the AT in a season. As I read up on the Long Traill and make plans, I see that there are many fewer re-supply options that I remember on the AT. A challenge calling for better planning. It doesn't daunt me. Planning planning planning. And execution!We joined the GMC a couple weeks ago and went on our first club hike last week. We hiked with the group up Mt. Peg in Woodstock, VT. It was ""easy"" and short. Not that I wasn't huffing and my quads were on fire. It was a dreary day, but the colors were fabulous. Then, there was the stop at the Woodstock Farmers Market for lunch--well worth the calories burned!","Making plans

I'm making daily walks and doing my 7 Minute Workout Challenge. This spring, I'll begin adding weight to my backpack. I have a few short hiking trips planned once the snow is gone and we are past mud season. Can't wait for the longer overnight hikes this summer!","

Shooting Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557566,"I am at ATI to get my head right for hiking next year. I had time to fill beforehand, so thought I'd visit Grayson Highlands and get a pony fix. I hiked a tiny bit both north and south where the AT crosses. Wondered about the hikers I met with the ginormous back packs--were any thru hikers?","Making plans
