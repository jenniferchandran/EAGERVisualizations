Macdaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585160,"My Amtrak train from Philadelphia arrived in Gainesville early morning on time, which according to shuttle driver Ron Brown is a rare event.  I registered my thru-hike at the Amicalola Falls Park office (hiker number 242).  After having my picture taken at the approach trail archway Ron dropped me off about 200 steps up the falls.  The lower steps were closed, apparently due to the extensive rainfall and concerns over flooding.  I could only see the outline of the falls as I climbed the remaining 400+ steps in foggy/rainy conditions. Heeding advice from Ron, I took the Len Foote Trail rather than the steep/rocky middle portion of the actual approach trail.  I met Sour Kraut, like me a 1st day NOBO thru-hiker, at the upper portion of the approach trail. We traded cameras and photos of ourselves at the southern terminus before heading to the Springer Mountain Shelter.  I arrived at the Springer Mountain Shelter very tired.  I couldn't help but think I was heading for a major butt whuppin' in the GA mountains based on how I felt.

Macdaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585661,"I thought I stayed at Gooch Mouuntain Shelter but on checking my Garmin tracker app (connect to Fenix 5x watch) I actually hiked on to Woody Gap... now I remember:
The training I did with a full pack back in PA (at Green Lane Park) established some baseline conditioning that prevented me from completely imploding during the first couple of weeks on the trail.  However the park terrain while somewhat hilly did not prepare me for the Georgia mountains.  The ascents seriously challenged me, with descents not too far behind as my legs tried to control speed and foot placement.  Several weeks prior I downloaded an electronic diary to my iPhone (""Day One"" app, I like it).  I intended (naively) to make entries at the conclusion of each day, taking pictures throughout that I could imbed in those entries. However I quickly reverted to survival mode given the physical rigors.  My world contracted to 3 feet in front of me while hiking and at days end to setting up my tent, filtering water, eating, and crawling into my sleeping bag.  No daily diary entries, few pictures.  I did try to socialize with fellow hikers in the evenings, but fatigue combined with the onset of winter darkness generally meant I as a goner (succumbing to hiker coma) by 7pm. In retrospect I was in vary degrees of survival mode for at least the first couple weeks. I had leg cramps nearly nearly every night that were manageable thanks to compression sleeves (Zensa) that I slipped on before going to sleep.  I routinely dissolved NUUN tablets in drinking water while hiking and I think the electrolyte replacement helped as well.  There were a couple days where I ran out of tablets and the onset and severity of cramps seemed worse.  
I set up my tent at a slight incline near the banks of a small creek just past Woody Gap, in company with thru-hiker Wise Man and mother/son section hikers (Momma Bear and Grant).  Before I nodded off I heard voices, seemingly far off.  I got out of the tent and could see headlamps of night hikers ascending the ravine on the other side of the creek. It looked surreal seeing lights steadily floating upward. The sound of running water was soothing throughout the night.  The tent pitch endured although at morning wakeup I found me and gear piled up on the downhill side.

First climb was Tesnatee Gap which is described by hikers in the Guthook app as a “very steep climb”.  Definitely. Selfie on Wildcat Mountain says it all. Crappy weather with mood to match. I revised my plans to overnight at the Whitely Gap shelter which is a whopping 1.2 mile walk off of the trail.    Given how I felt it was not just little ironic to walk to a shelter so far off the trail.  I was surprised to find someone at the shelter.  The guy told me he had purposely selected that shelter because he wanted solitude.  I set up my tent a good distance from the shelter.  As the day came to a close a section hiking couple reached the shelter, setting up their tent in same vicinity as mine.  I was glad to have the company, nice talking to them.  Interactions with the solitude guy were unsettling.  I decided to bug out as early as I could in the morning, and did just that.  One foot in front of the other.","Bull Gap

I recall sending a ""This sucks ---!"" text to my wife one particularly crappy (cold, rain, fog) evening during the first few days. In my rush to leave the Whitely Gap Shelter I forgot my tent stakes.  Upon arriving at the Blue Mountain Shelter I used rocks to anchor my tent guy lines.  Worked pretty well.  Later in the evening I joked about how well the rocks worked and that I might just pack them up and take them NOBO.  In response a fellow hiker pulled a set of stakes from his backpack and gave them to me, explaining that he was getting off the trail and did not need them  Quite an act of trail kindness.  Wow.  I left the rocks at Blue Mountain Shelter.One foot in front of the other.  Repeat.","Whitely Gap Shelter

Macdaddy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585723,"Tented on Tray mountain as usual.  Have not yet slept in a shelter.  On a positive note my sleep system was working great.  Very comfortable.  
Woke up at 5:30am to assure I had enough time to get to Top of Georgia Hostel.  Desperate to get to a dry and warm place.  Very tired, both physically and mentally.  Tired of the crappy cold overcast foggy rainy weather.  Light rain became progressively heavier throughout the morning as the temperature rose only slightly from high 30's to low 40's.  I donned all my rain gear except for rain kilt.  The Tray Mountain descent was hellish.  The trail was awash.  I fell twice sliding on mud, and in doing so learned to recognize the subtle signs of unstable mud, avoiding additional falls.  I used trekking poles to soften the first fall but heard a crack. The 2nd fall was deliberate as I was sliding down the trail towards a sharp turn with a sudden drop-off; decision time.  A few days later the cracked pole would break completely.
Constant cold rain. I was instantly cold anytime I stopped. Realized I'd go hypothermic unless I kept moving.  Legs very cold and wet, a big mistake not wearing kilt.  Mountain Laurel Designs (MLD) gaiters worked well; kept the cold rain from soaking into my hiking boots.  Still ended up with wet feet but warm wet wool socks vs. cold wet.  Arcteryx hard shell jacket saved me... the only place I was relatively dry was upper body.  The Beta AR jacket kept the rain out, an amazing piece of gear worth every penny.  MLD rain mitts collected pools of water inside at my fingertips, which I attribute to user error. I did not overwrap the mitts within the sleeves of the hard shell.  It was raining so hard that the jacket, with its DWR finish and the help of gravity, channeled water into the mitts.  Now I viscerally understand the difference between cold wet and warm wet.  Was wearing an all-synthetic polyester upper baselayer.  Although the hard shell shielded the rain, the baselayer became cold and clammy from perspiration.  Not the first time I was cold and clammy in an all-synthetic base layer.  I resolved to replace all synthetic base layers with wool blends.  
Lots of lessons-learned.  
Arrived a Top of Georgia Hostel in early afternoon. Was offered a hot cup of tea... best tea ever!!  Peeled off clothes, donned hospital scrubs, and took a shower for the first time since getting on the train in Philadelphia to head south.  Headed into Hiawassee that evening to an all-you-can-eat buffet.  More hard rain forecast, so planned for the next day to be first zero.Resume putting one foot in front of the other are tomorrow's zero.","

I felt great my first day back on the trail after the zero at TofG Hostel. I knew zero's would help physical recovery, but the extent surprised me.  I felt completely rejuvenated the first day back on the trail.  As I hiked towards Franklin each subsequent trail day was progressively harder as I accrued fatigue from both the mileage and pack weight.  
I starting looking forward to more zero's and realized I would experience the same pattern throughout my thru hike, that is, a day to day increase in trail fatigue between zeros.  The problem with zeros is that they're zeros.  I might recover effectively but that recovery did not get me any closer to Mt. Katahdin. It seemed there were 3 ""level of effort"" variables that contributed to fatigue. Mileage, weight, and walking speed. I was currently averaging about 10 miles a day which was fine for the early going, particularly considering the weather.  However 10 mile days was not adequate mileage over the long term.  If anything daily mileage would have to increase.  The speed variable, particularly up hills, was something I was starting to manage better.  I started out in GA attacking climbs but quickly realized that far less energy was expended if I deliberately climbed more slowly.  I might get to the top 10 minutes later but with dramatically less expenditure of energy.  The only variable left to exploit was base weight which was currently ~21 lbs.  As I hiked my way to Franklin I started thinking of making some major gear changes (mostly deletions).  Outdoor 76, an outfitter located in the center of town, helped me with several gear changes.  I sent 5+ pounds of equipment home from Franklin.

I went down to the post office this morning to pick up a package from my brother Brian.  I saw several groups of hikers exiting town heading north through the cold drizzle.  None seemed happy.P.S.  Post Office could not find my package","Hot Springs
