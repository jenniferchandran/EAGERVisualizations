Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565129,"It will be three years since I abandoned the trail (and hopes of a thru-hike) because of knee issues.
I have decided the most prudent thing to do is get back on the trail where I have not hiked and complete the AT that way.  In 2014 I had hiked over 500 miles and was having knee issues and II stopped for a break and met an old gentleman I will never forget.  After telling him of my plight to try thru-hiking twice and not being able to follow through, he said ""Kokopelli, I think it's time for you to just fill in the gaps""...... wiser words were never spoken.
This fall will be a long section hike (I guess some call it a LASH).... long ass section hike. But I will start in Boiling Springs where I had to bail in 2007.  I am now retired so time is on my side and I will make slow and steady progress to Dalton, Mass.  I was fortunate to meet a hiker extraordinaire named Tony Tiger back in 2007 and we navigated from Dalton and got most of the north trail completed including Mt. Katahdin.  I just have not done this 'mid-trail' section. You make lifetime friends out here as Tony Tiger and Handyman and I hiked together every year after that (as our work would allow).
I am super excited to be hiking with Catchup who completed her thru-hike in 2007 and a friend from Florida named Could-be-Worse.
Just wanted to make this my official announcement and it makes things 'real'.  Can't tell you how pumped up I get when I think of my re-entry onto that wonderful Appalachian Trail.",,View Entry,"May 18, Thu",0

The more the merrier, especially since I have to start very near Rocksilvania. After hearing so much about this section I need to put it behind me.",,View Entry,"May 18, Thu",0

This picture was from that wonderful hostel you got to by blowing an air horn and the owner would come get you by boat.
You washed your clothes by hand and used an old hand cranked ringer to rinse.  Best food ever!! huge hamburgers and breakfast omelets that took forever to eat.
Correct me if I am wrong but I do not think The Whitehouse Landing is in operation now.  It is sad because it was amazing with it's location and the loons calling....I was glad I got to experience it.
Another thing I want to mention was the disappointment in my hiking boots.  I have purchased KEENS for the last several years and they were so comfortable with little break-in time. The last pair rubbed so badly I had large contusions on my outer ankles and hobbled home from my four day hike. :(  
The KEEN company had a few excuses why they would not refund or exchange.  Now I am seeking to try a new boot or trail runner type shoe.  Any suggestions out there?   
Now that this is my third entry please go back and read my first page which explains my reason for my hike. Happy Hiking!!",,View Entry,"May 18, Thu",0
Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565347,"It's Saturday and I just completed two hours of cycling and running. It's the only way to maintain some fitness here in the flat Lowcountry of South Carolina.  I have been competing in triathlon since 1983 and in 2007 I was totally amiss being cocky enough to think being a triathlete would make my AT hike 'a piece of cake'.......WRONG!! I was in agony a lot trying to make it up all those mountains day after day after day.  But now I get it.  You tackle the Appalachian Trail in the moment. You bite off little bits and the process builds and grows to the love of backpacking.  I am now hooked.
As I said trying to maintain some stamina for my LASH in September.  I was excited to get an email from Winkle.  Winkle was one of my hiking partners in 2014 & and she completed about 500 miles with me and maintains a section of trail in the Georgia section.  I also kept a 2014 journal where I have many pictures of Winkle.  She informed me she was not able to leave a message for me in my guest book. :(  I was wondering why I hadn't received any notes & it seems there is a glitch that Leif has not worked out.  But please keep trying as I love support from my fellow hikers. Winkle informed me of the Oboz boots/trail shoes that might work for me.  Good info to check out.
OK, I must sign off as I am excited to read today's hiking entries.  I know everyone is having a great time at Trail Days.

Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567235,"Well......I just spent about an hour typing a long entry and when I hit 'add entry' it went away!  I am so frustrated I could cry. :(
I am going to enter this short note just to make sure things are uploading correctly.  Be prepared to read about four days of hiking recently to break in my boots on the AT.
Be back shortly.Ok, it looks like it did upload that time.  I'll see if  I can halfway re-type what I had. I was recently in Atlanta in late March for a dental conference so I had the itch to head on up highway 400 to do some spring hiking on the AT.  I knew there would be plenty of thru-hikers to meet and the weather should be good.  I have never completed the full Approach Trail so since I was parking my car at the Amicalola Welcome Center, I figure the Approach would be on my agenda.  Another reason to do a four day hike out was to break in the new Keen boots I purchased. (More about that later).  The Approach started with 600 plus steps and it was very strenuous with a fully loaded backpack.  I met a young man heading up the steps who was also huffing and puffing and we would stop every few minutes to catch our breath.  He had attempted a thru-hike last year but only made it a week.  This year he had tattooed a large AT symbol on his forearm to remind him that it took drive and effort to reach Maine.  I sure hope he is still hiking.We leap frogged most of the 8.8 miles and we were sweating buckets.  It was supposed to rain ....and it did! As long as I was moving I was ok but it rained off and on for about an hour.  I got close to my destination and stopped at Black Gap Shelter.  I met some really nice hikers but decided to push on to the top and make Springer Mt. Shelter my stop.  When I got to the top and found a nice tenting spot an energetic gal came over and asked if she could help me set up.  I explained I really had a good system and I would just do it myself but we talked as I was doing my chores and I really liked her. She had spunk.  Her name was Marsha so I said I thought her trail name should be Marshmallow. She loved the name and so it was.The next morning we packed up and as we hiked out it started to rain again.  There were many thru-hikers on the trail and it made me wish I was hiking on with them. Fun group.  Marshmallow and I met a gal from England named Alice.....YES, you got it, we dubbed her Wonderland. She really liked the name. I love handing out trail names.  The three of us were supposed to end up at Hawk Shelter for the night but somewhere along the way I lost them and have never seen them since. We all agreed not to hike further than Hawk so I was disappointed to not get their contact info so I could stay in touch.  If anyone knows the where abouts of Marshmallow, Wonderland or Will, let me know. :)That night was a horrendous storm.  There were so many people crammed into the shelter I had to set up my tent.  For 7 hours there were torrential rains and lightening.  When there was a lull I would get out of the tent and shake the water off as my roof was drooping.  I did stay dry somehow. I do love my little Hubba Tent but I better water proof it again before September. I didn't get a bit of sleep being frightened all night by lightening and storms and as I was packing up I heard a few people say they were getting off the trail because it seemed to be more than they bargained for.  I had been in bad storms in the past and survived so it wasn't that big of a deal, but non the less concerning to others.I headed back toward Springer for the night and came upon a thru hiker helping a rookie hiker and was carrying a lot of her stuff.  It seemed the rookie hiker took no incentive to get fit for the trail or study how much you need to carry.  She was 'toast' and was heading for the nearest road to be shuttled home.  They asked me if I would carry some of the poundage to lighten her load.  OH MY was my pack heavy after taking on that chore!  A 32 oz. jar of P-nut butter, large tub of wipies, large bottles of shampoo, rinse and lotion and deodorant, and several cans of food....ugh! I did offer the unhappy hiker some words of compassion and told her this was a good lesson/experience to show her she just needed to be a little more prepared and this trek would be fun.After a comfortable night back at Springer (the stars at night were like diamonds!) I packed up the next day and headed back down the Approach for the car.  My ankles were in pain!! The new Keens were rubbing the outer ankles and caused large contusions.  The manufacturers would not even help me resolve the issue with refund or even an exchange....upsetting.  So now I am researching whether to purchase low boots vs. high, or different Keens vs. Oboz. we'll see.As I was typing this entry one of my hiking partners, Could-be-Worse', called and we were talking final plans for the hike. What a coincidence. I will be in touch when there is more to say. Happy Hiking!!","Amicalola Welcome Center

Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569819,"Just wanted to check in and share my excitement that the September LASH has come together.  Everyone is set to go on the 2nd of that month and all transportation has been arranged and I have a place to store my car without worry thanks to Certain. Could-be-Worse has her plane ticket.  My only concern is for Catchup who is having some knee issues and is undecided as to when she should receive treatment.  If you read my 2014 journal you will see how I mention my knees almost daily (sorry folks) so I am just concerned about our launch.  Rocksylvania is a crude start for our whole crew as that is where we will step on the AT.  Well actually it is Boiling Springs so we have about three days before the big stuff hits.
The temps are very hot already in South Carolina so I think starting our 450 mile journey in Sept. is a good thing.  The nights will be cooler for sure.
That's about it fellow hikers! Hope you haven't grown tired of all the other hiking journals by the time September gets here. Please stay tuned for our big trek of Pa., New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts.",,Still in S.C.,"Jun 24, Sat",0
Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575446,"I am about two weeks from my immersion back into the mountains!  My fun and beautiful daughter and granddaughter came for a visit from Japan and spent my granddaughter's first birthday here on Hilton Head.  It was priceless.Now that I am close to my trek I have lots to do.  Put another seam-seal on the tent, spray my clothes and gear with permethrin and pay the bills for the coming month.I made an entry recently about a short hiking trip and how my brand new KEEN boots rubbed horrible spots on my outer ankles and caused swelling and bruising.  I simply can't have this, especially hiking in Pennsylvania where my ankles will twist and turn every which way. When the KEEN manufacturers would not help me at all (and I don't have an extra $130 to toss to new boots) I had to be resourceful.I am sure many laughed when they saw my posted picture...but hey.... it's what hikers do, right? We have to get creative at times. SO for two months these boots have been help captive by two pair of needle nose pliers to loosen the stiff areas at the ankles.  We don't have any mountains here but there is a Forest Preserve and soon I will test the boots to see if my idea helped.Even though one of my hiking buddies had to pull out, there are still two or three others who are ready!It's almost GO TIME!!",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Fri",0

I have not received emails from those people so I can get back with them so not sure if it's a website glitch or maybe emails weren't submitted by choice.. but either way thank you for the comments.My boots do feel a bit looser around my ankles but I have the biggest test of all on the rock paths coming up soon.

We hiked past corn and soy fields and into dark tunnels and enchanted forests and over cattle styles. I had a good laugh when a huge sign, deep into the trail, announced there is a trip zone. Really? Right here is the 'trip zone?' I thought the whole A.T. Was a cause for tripping... lolAll in all a very good (and wet) day on the trail.

We were beat at 10 miles so we found a beautiful stealth camp site with a beautiful view in a cut field.. bugs were horrible but didn't care. We wanted those packs OFF!! Today we met some SOBO's.

Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577002,"we awoke from our night (bright moonlight shone through our tents and kept us awake) but we decided to wait for breakfast down the trail. Headed out at 7:30.
My left hip flexor was very weak and was hard to place my weight on that side so I took 800 mg. Advil and hobbled on until everything loosened up.
We stopped for breakfast and got water then headed on into Duncannon for lunch. Somehow we ended up on the SoBo north bound path but we headed down it and were really turned around when we reached town. A nice out of town fisherman showed us how to reach the Doyle Hotel and soon we were standing in front of the iconic building.
Vicki and Pat served up awesome burgers and while there we dined with other hikers. It was an awesome time.
But we had to head out and we walked the hot streets of Duncannon and over the long Susquehanna river footpath. The climb out was steep and tough and never ending rock paths and rock scrambles. Some seemed very dangerous but we made the right decisions and made it to camp successfully. We hardly ate we were so tired and fell asleep to the sounds of the trains in the distance.Also wanted to add that my Keen boots are working marvelously after I stretched the ankle-cuffs!! Love them! Just too bad the manufacturer would stand behind a flaw in their product","stealth camp

Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577087,"awoke around 7:00 and made plans to pack quick and head out because rains were predicted.
We were hiking by 7:30 and stopped at the next shelter for breakfast. There we met a group of four hikers headed NORTH!! Eureka!! They felt sure they were the last of the Thru hikers. They were all musicians and later we were treated to beautiful folk music at the shelter. 
The group was Mountain Man with his dog Ruby, Mags with her dog Peaches, Real Estate with his dog Sizzle and Too High (meaning we are hiking tall mountains.) 
We all agreed to head to next shelter (about 7 miles) because a big storm was to blow in. Even though this trail section had some rocks it was a much more pleasant hike. Made it to the shelter and got water before the storm hit. Sometimes it works perfect like that.... sometimes not!
The water source was the most difficult I have negotiated!! Over 300 tall stone steps straight down, and I slipped and my butt landed on a spiky stone and it HURT!! But am still hiking.. fell asleep to the heavy pounding of rain on the roof.

Our group of 6 decided to sit out the day long deluge while other SOBO's heading into the wet day.Sleeping and staying in our sleeping bags until 9:00 was such a luxury especially hearing the rain on the roof. Mountain Man and Real Estate built a great fire and lo and behold Too High brought out popcorn he found in a hiker box.

A bit coolish but we kept a nice pace on rolling rocky paths. There were a few tough, hour long uphills which we sweated and plodded along but it was our intention to make good time so we could enjoy our camp site. We met a few SOBO's, Halloween, wrong Way and Walrus. We ate a quick lunch right on the trail then hurried on. We arrived at Yellow Tail campground and we were miffed because for the first time we had no phone reception!

I'll miss my hiking partner but she is very worried about the hurricane which is predicted to hit her area in Florida so it was important for her to get back to her family.
This was a beautiful morning and we knew we had some work to do in the form of a long climb....but then we get to frolic along some meadows and flatter land. (At least this is what I had heard). It was true.  Today was one of my favorite hikes as we went through fields and farmland.  There were birds and butterflies flitting around and so many colors and types of wildflowers you would not believe it was fall.
We came to a log crossing and I love these kind of gymnastics but when I got to the end the log was so high up I was at a loss as to how to get off.  So I threw my poles across and took off my pack while balancing in the 'beam' and dropped it to the ground.  After straddling the log like it was a big Clydesdale I was able to roll to my tummy then drop to the ground..(see what I mean about gymnastics)? I put my arms in the air as to announce to the judges I had completed the program. :)
Could be Worse and I walked along a small river then stopped and had a snack before doing the last few miles into town.  After we crossed a road there was a sign announcing a 3 mile walk into town.  The crush-n-run pathway looked easy so we took off walking.  It did take a while to walk into Lickdale and it was getting hotter with each few minutes. Soon we broke into a commercial area and I saw the sign for the Days Inn in front of us.
After Laundry and long showers and lay on the bed for a bit enjoying the soft mattresses.  My partner and I wanted to celebrate the successful completion of one week on the trail (and it was Could Be Worse's first long section) so we walked around the area just trying to find a little champagne, wine or even a beer....there was none to be had!! Best we could tell it was a county law that these beverages couldn't be sold at convenient stores.  Darn!! So we ordered pizza and salad and ate in the room and toasted our hike with cups of water.

Today there were not many bad climbs but lots of rock hiking and my feet are really sore on bottom and top. Mags showed me how to tire my boots to relieve pressure. It worked! I did notice on my AWOL guide that the decent down to Port Clinton looked steep and it was!!!I know some youngsters and those with good knees love to just barrel down these slopes but all I could think about was taking baby steps or I would tumble and roll into a ball and arrive at the bottom battered and broken. But I did make it to the first flat area (with stinging knees) and this was a bike path to a close town, Hamburg.  I saw on the map it had a lot more to offer than Port Clinton and it was 3 miles away, but we were only 1/2 mile away from the latter so the three of us did a little more steep stepping downward and we were soon on the railroad tracks across from the town.Arriving in some of these towns is always unpredictable but as we walked through the little deserted community I couldn't even imagine what we could find there.  But after roaming around we did find plenty to do.We were allowed to set up tents in the Pavilion area, which later we had a beautiful fire and good conversation, then we went exploring.  We had a local take us to Hamburg and we re-supplied at WalMart and ate at Taco Bell for really cheap.  As we were walking back to Port Clinton the van from Cabelas  stopped and gave us a free lift.  Thanks van driver...was it Jeff??  That afternoon we paid a visit to the famous candy store called The Peanut Shop.  Apparently people stop from far and wide and line up around the little store with their buckets.  These little buckets get filled to the brim with every kind of candy you can imagine....(May Janes & Firballs from long ago and new candies like Pop Rocks or sour Gummies).  I picked out several items (rootbeer balls & banana Taffy).....that store was just plain cool!Later that night we were joined by Mountain Man and Too High and O.P. and several others for a big camp fire.  Drifted off to sleep in my tent listening to the shuffle of the trains go by.  We were not in an area where they were required to blow their horns so that made it extra nice.","

Hiking on Monday 19th... 15.7Woke up from my stealth camp site.  Even though I had to tent by myself it was a very quiet and uneventful night.  I at least expected to hear animals roaming around but it was super still with only muffled traffic sounds in the distance. I packed up early and had made up my mind I was going to find a hotel (no matter the cost....well, within reason) Last evening had me so rattled and I was covered with days of dried sweat and I just wanted to put myself back in a good frame of mind. It was super humid and foggy. Walked into Branchville with Monday morning traffic zooming along. Had to pick just the right moment to get across the highway.  As I hiked back up the other side of the highway two beautiful, healthy deer leaped from the trail and stood pretty close by looking at me as I reached into my pocket to get the phone for a picture.I knew by noon I was supposed to be at the top of a high climb and there was an open air pavilion of some sort. I was making good progress, hiking upward then all of a sudden broke through the brush and there was the pavilion! It was a great place for pack-off, and make a few calls to try to locate a nearby hotel.  My attempts were futile as one lady said to me ""Honey, you are out in the country. We are 25 miles from you. No, there is no Uber"". That certainly popped my bubble of having a bath and eating a big dinner.Today's hike was moderately hard but all the trekkers I saw today were drenched in sweat and had the look of unwanted labor on their faces.  I stopped a group of youngsters, not sure why at the moment, and spoke briefly to them because they were so cheery and fresh looking. I said ""You guys look way too fresh to have been hiking all day."" They responded they had spent the night at Mosey's place and it was great.  One of the young guys even called her and reserved an spot for me at her place since I didn't have phone reception. Once again the trail provides! I stopped just the right people and now I am going to have a shower and food tonight!! yippee!!There was one obstacle. I had already hiked 8 miles and this meant I had to do some pretty good steppin' to do another 7.5 miles before 4:00. I was on a mission with an upbeat spirit so I headed out.  I soon got to Mashipagong Shelter and saw no water but I just happened to look in the bear box and eureka....there was cold water (probably just placed there) in jugs. I chugged as much as I could then hiked on.  I would have spring in my gate for a good while then just come to a grinding halt.  Then I would recharge and do the same thing all over again. I reminded myself it was like my triathlons... you have these surges then rekindled energy. The terrain was so difficult I finally had to call Mosey and tell her I just wasn't going to get there by 4:00 as I had two more miles.  She said no problem and she had to come back to the ranger station later anyway.  When I finally reached the beautifully mowed grass of the ranger station I totally collapsed and just lay on my back thanking my lucky stars I did that hike.  I met Macaroni who was also waiting for Mosey.  What a genuinely nice guy.  My feet were terribly tender, hardest day so far. There were Tricky rock descents at my most fatigued time of day.High point State park....Mosey had thru-hiked in 2016 and knew exactly what hikers needed. Had a hot shower and just relaxed on the couch while the other hikers got squared away then we all headed for dinner. I got a huge thanksgiving panini with fries for dinner.. Laundry was completed then I crawled into bed.  That was the most quiet hostel night I had ever had.  Even the other guys said they couldn't believe no one snored!

I didn't mind the climbs because the sharp rocks weren't hurting my feet. Arrived early at Secret Shelter and met owner Jim Miller. He thru hiked in 1989. Lovely site, donkeys, deer and wild turkeys abound. When Real Estate arrived with his dogs the donkeys went into 'panic attack' mode! They were aggressive toward the dogs.  Jim Miller came over and said to keep the dogs closed inside the shelter because the donkeys think dogs are coyotes and they have the instinct to fight and defend themselves.  Who knew? Met Fiddle who is close to my age and we will head North together as partners for now. Funny how the trail provides.  I remember sitting at home thinking and worrying about enough people out here hiking and here is a lady who is going the same distance I am. (But I found out later she is a super fast hiker so we would meet up several times a day to check on each other.) Also met Gator, doing a section for this week. He was a very nice gentleman who smiled the whole time he was talking.  He said he comes out for a section every fall but just wasn't counting on it being so hot and near 90 everyday.Had a suspicious character chatting me up early in the a.m. at the High Point headquarters.  I did make a report and the park rangers and sheriffs treated me with utmost concern!!

Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578759,"Woke up with a very wet tent just from having set up in a freshly mowed field.  Fiddle and I hung our tent covers on various tree limbs to dry.We were in no hurry today because we knew the terrain was not to be as hard as previous weeks so we took the luxury to leave out of camp at 9:00 a.m.Sure enough our walk started with a boardwalk with tinges of color in the trees.  The look of fall was happening but not the feeling.  We already remarked hot and humid it was.  The hike was pleasant most of the morning. Some rolling ups and downs and a few rock-hops but the terrain was lovely!  We alternated between flat corridors of leaf strewn paths then would break into an open farm field.  Water was noticeably not available so we did monitor how fast we drank our water.  At one point I looked down and realized I had dropped my buff headband that meant so much to me.  It was 10 years old and I purchased it at the NOC when my daughter ended up leaving for Japan....it had a cherry-blossom design and reminded me of her.  I had not clipped it through the usual carabiner and just loosely draped it over one of the backpack attachments.  I was so upset. :(  When backpacking I just never hike back (intentionally) because I had no idea how many miles back I lost it.  I had to mourn it for a little bit then just realize it was my stupid mistake to not secure it better.....it was gone.  Fiddle said ""You just never know.  It might show up"".We hiked a good ways and finally it was getting a little late and we needed to look for a home for the night.  The only thing we found was just a bit off the trail into some pine trees.  It was noticeably near the road and we could see a house through the pine trees.  I normally never stay this close to civilization but we did not know what was ahead for tenting.  We sat up close to each other and I had my pepper spray close by.  (We were at least right by a swift stream for water resupply).  For quite a while we heard children screaming and playing and dogs barking and we could hear all kinds of commotion going on from our tents but as night fell over us we disappeared from view of anyone.  Neither of us slept very well but we had plenty of rest.","Secret shelter

Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578818,"The day started beautifully and was to be a day of mystery and surprises.The temps were not bad (high 60's, low 70's) and we ate quickly then packed up.  The road crossing up came up in less than a mile so that is why we heard so much neighborhood commotion last night.  I have always had the understanding I wouldn't tent close to the road but we had to make an educated decision last night and all turned out ok.We both had a good bit of trash we wanted to get rid of but decided against putting it in a person's trash can which appeared right at our road crossing.  We didn't want anyone thinking we had done something disrespectful even if it was trash..lol.  Low and behold a mile later we walked to another road crossing and there was a trash receptacle and port-o-potties,  Jackpot! I wasn't aware but we were entering the mile long boardwalk which covered a lot of a wildlife preserve and it was spectacular! Gentle breezes were blowing there were neighborhood people out for a morning stroll and flocks of birds about their morning business.  We went up and over a beautiful suspension bridge then continued on more boardwalk.As we ascended a mountain we noticed in AWOL's guide there was an abandoned house just off the trail where you could fill up with fresh water from an outside spigot. We did this and remarked how cool it would be for someone to turn this house into a hostel.....so close to the trail and not another hostel for many miles.  Then we came to some farmland and crossed over the stile (a stairway over the fence so the cattle couldn't get out, but we could get in)....then we walked over a very long plank-walk.  Please see my picture in the photo section as I thought it was truly one of my favorite photos.  At the end of this cow field and just steps up the road, was Heavenly Hill Farms store and what an oasis it was!! Fiddle and I split a carton of cherry tomatoes and drank ginger ice tea and for dessert we had an apple cider do-nut!......the road side store was all decked out for Halloween and had bails of straw and dried corn stalks and pumpkins for sale.  I explored the inside and found a section with all types of Halloween yard decorations.  I love Halloween and could have spent a lot more time exploring, but alas we had to ascend The Stairway To Heaven and it was a tough one!! it took me 50 minutes to do the mile climb and as it got to the steeper part there was tricky foot placement but soon I did get to the summit (with a lot of praying).  Fiddle and I sat at the summit for a good while catching our breath and watching hawks ride the currents.About an hour later we hiked to a spot and just sat down out of the sun, just off the trail, for a lunch break.  As we got up to leave I looked ahead and saw something fluttering in the tree ahead.......it was the same color as my lost head buff from yesterday but only thought it a coincidence.  Well, Can you believe it?! IT was my buff!! There are not that many people hiking north and thought my head band might have been picked up and gone south.  What were the chances someone would pass us going north and just decide to leave the buff in a tree so hopefully the owner would pass by.  I was pleasantly shocked. Someone suggested it was someone else's that looked like mine......I did think that notion was a bit crazy because that just made the odds even higher that two people were in the same area and we both lost our exact same buffs...no way!! I put it to my nose and breathed in my smell....yep, mine!!!Another crazy happening in our day was when Fiddle and I came to a road crossing where we needed a promised shuttle to a bed and breakfast so she could pick up a package.  Fiddle had called several times with no answer or return call.  We sat at the road side having gone almost 12 miles and were hot and exhausted.  Fiddle needed her re-supply box and we couldn't get a shuttle.  There was no Uber.  Only thing left to do was stick out our thumbs.  Within 5 minutes an exceptionally nice man in a beautiful new Audi (my fav. car) pulled over and said get in and where can I take you?  Wynn said he stopped for hikers quite often to take them to the grocery but would gladly take us to this B&B.  He was even kind enough to say we didn't have as much a 'hiker stink' as some he had picked up.....ha ha, thanks Wynn!  When we got to the Meadow Lark Inn (and it was very hard to find) there was no one around and the place looked a bit abandoned .....Wynn gave us his number because he was a bit concerned too and he headed out.  Fiddle and I went to the door and no one was home (No one ever showed up either).....but the house was wide open and Fiddle could see her mail right inside the front door! The neighbors told us they had not seen the owner for days and they were less than friendly.  It was getting dusky and Fiddle and I made the call to Wynn and he and his wife agreed to let us set up our tents in their back yard.I had not a care in the world that night.  Wynn and Denise made us dinner and made us breakfast the next day! We had freshly mowed grass to set up our tents.  These people lived in an affluent part of Lakeside, NJ and we were so humbled that they would take time and concern to help two old gals on the Appalachian Trail.  Can't express the love and kindness you can find out here.  Wynn, Denise and their beautiful daughter Sarah were Extreme Trail Angels.  We can't thank them enough for all they did!","

Kokopelli,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579144,"Sorry folks, it has taken a while to update:
Wynn and Denise dropped us off at the trail and it was hard to head out again after having such warm comfort from these totally unexpected strangers.  (We aren't strangers anymore).  Last night around the dinner table we exchanged bits and pieces about each other's lives.  It was heaven to feel safe and well-fed.
But alas Fiddle and I knew we had some hard miles to hike today.  We were not sure about what lay ahead but it was my toughest and most physical day so far.  We hiked along and the trail became more and more of the boulder scrambles.  I was fretting too much and taking longer paths than necessary to avoid stuff but found I was making myself miserable.  My choice was to trust my boots and go straight up the boulders.  It became fun as I pounded out the miles and realized my Keens had 'stick to it power'......lol.  The only problem comes when there are large foot reaches and I am so short I sometimes have to get on my belly or butt to make it up or down certain sections. (I keep remembering Kinsman in NH where I thought I certainly would not live through that.)
Fiddle and I stopped for a snack near a stream (or so it was marked in the guide)...there remained nothing but a small pool of semi-stagnant water.  I had had no water for the last few miles so I took my titanium cup and skimmed and skimmed the surface to get enough water to filter so I could hike forward.  It was another very hot day around 90 degrees and I would lose a bit of focus when I had not drank enough water.  Like Borderline said ""One bad step ends the journey"".
As we sat there we were joined by Weeble Wobble and Ain't Right.  We had been leap frogging them all day and I soon discovered I had hiked with these two in 2014!! How crazy and coincidental was that!! We had hiked into Harper's Ferry that year and we had our pictures taken at the AT Headquarters. We called that break our reunion party.
Now we had a group of four loosely hiking together. AWOL's guide didn't look too threatening for the next 5 miles but then we noticed a small note at the bottom of the page 'Despite the unimposing profile, the rocks and abrupt ups and downs make this next section challenging'......crap!! and yes it was very hard. We passed the prospect rock and the day was very clear and off in the distance was the NY skyline! So very cool. (I will post that picture when I update again.) Our group had a date with a hot dog and Coke at a road crossing and we were going to be very tight as the stand closed at 3:30.  We were moving so slow we all finally gave in and said ""No hot dog for us"".  But we steadily made our way and picked up another cool duo along the way Tara and Chumbawamba.  We were 8 minutes late as we approached the road crossing and the hot dog stand was still open!!  That dog and relish and chips never tasted so good!  As we sat there eating we drew quite a group of other people who wanted to know about our hike.
After being fueled we had another few miles to the Wildcat Shelter and of course there was more boulder scrambling but we got to the shelter right at dusk and everyone decided to set up tents.  Another warm night but I soon drifted off to sleep.","Wawayandah (Back yard of extreme Trail Angel)

Then Ain't Right said ""and you even have several years after that actually"". So, it's nice to know Fiddle can pass these dinners down to her grandkids and their kids. :DWe did get out of camp by 7:20 and sure enough the rock climbing began almost immediately.  Since we had a group of six now I felt a bit easier knowing if I slipped or fell I would have some comfort or rescue.  We trekked along climbing up and over and around rock ledges.  Temperatures were in the high 80's and everyone was pouring sweat.  I must admit I would much rather have these hot conditions instead of pouring rain.  Especially in these rocky areas.  We had a good bit of climbing up and down rock obstacles and there was this tiny blip on AWOL's book profile.  OMG let me tell you folks, that was one mean little blip!!  going up the climb I couldn't see the white blazes and I had both poles in one hand and my back was getting hung up on ledges above me and at one point I was straddling a large boulder separation and couldn't move forward or back! I was dripping sweat and said to myself ""You can't just stand here forever, now DO something!!""...... (I talk to myself a lot out here) lol.  My legs just don't have much of a reach.  I took a few deep breaths and gathered my courage and tilted to my right side just a bit then said to myself ""NOW GO!!"" I pushed with all my might and I made it to the other side.  I look up and there is more of the climb to negotiate. But working my way up I finally arrived at the top and half the group was there and when the others arrived it was 'pack-off' time and we all had lunch.Weeble Wobble hadn't arrived at the summit yet but Ain't Right was watching his progress on a Guthook Garmin of some sort.  The little dot (which represented Weeble) was slowly making progress so it seemed so Ain't Right wasn't too worried about his hiking partner.  We are all watching the little screen and suddenly the little dot went backward a bit.  Now we all panicked thinking he had fallen or something. So Ain't Right climbed a bit of the way down and looked and saw Weeble Wobble taking a nap at the base of the climb.  Oh my gosh what a hoot!! There we were anxiously watching a dot on a screen while WW was comfortably sawing logs......We moved forward all day long then we came to a place called 'Agony's Descent'.....geez! Was definitely one of the hardest descents to date but we all somehow made it down the boulder scramble and gave high-fives all around at the bottom.  Someone had left trail magic of sugary snacks.  We were all able to have a Coke and split what were left of the Little Debbie snacks.  We are so thankful to whoever leaves trail magic.","Wildcat Shelter

Kids like Jack Rabbit, Red Stripe and Handyman were out of sight in no time.There was much more ascending today than descent. Once we crossed into NC it only got harder. This makes the third time I have climbed this monster~ why do I forget the misery that comes with a three hour climb??... but up we went!Getting close to the shelter people like Sunshine,Ranger Z, BAMA and I sat by a creek to resupply our water and just rest. A very nice guy from Germany (who has hiked in Switzerland) even said it was an extremely tough day for him. BAMA went to the shelter (after we all made our observations about the sign, lol) and I sat up my tent. I was beyond hungry so I made a concoction of noodles, cheese and tuna and scarfed it down. Delicious!Once in my tent I fell asleep in no time.","Dicks creek Gap

It was a 360 degree view of mountain beauty. We were told you could see 4 different states.I was so exhausted by the end of the hike. I guess almost two weeks worth of climbing mountains has gotten to my legs. But I am having a great time.,"Franklin

They were out for a field trip and stopped to talk about our hike. One cute little boy looked at my pitiful snacks in it’s rumpled baggy and said he would most certainly have given me his lunch if he had any left.. so cute.We hit TWO trail Magic’s today! Jackpot! Burning town gap hosted the first lunch with burgers and chips and cookies. BAMA and I had just smacked from our packs and only wanted Coke Zero. Thanks Julie and Joe!Now it’s getting dusky and we stop for a second trail magic. Grabbed a hotdog and soda as my dinner. Thanks to a group from outside of Atlanta.BAMA and I were about toast but I told her I knew we could slowly make our way to the Wesser Firetower. Up and up we went (being spurred on by the coming sunset) I was in a serious sweat but the food we had beforehand really helped. We went one more mile and made it to the campsite before 8:00p.m. I was proud of our ‘late in the day ‘ surge. Had just enough time to set up my tent and slept really soundly.

A lot of steep rocky foot placements and going downhill with weight on your back is a matter of total focus. My knees weren’t like it either. There also a lot of trail erosion where your foot could slip right off the edge of the path and down the side of the mountain you go.We finally hit the NOC at 10:45a.m. And went straight to the restaurant for breakfast. We just missed the breakfast cutoff so we ordered burgers and sat by the huge window watching the competition kayakers in action below us.We got laundry done and payed for a bunk and we’ Be in from the rain tonight.Went back to the restaurant for a glass of wine and BAMA and I split a small pizza for dinner.We are sitting around with Raven, Dillon, and others then the strange hiker, Duck Fart came in spouting off random comments and everyone quickly dispersed.Supposed to rain tomorrow but we hope it’s a light rain.","Wesser Shelter

There was an overturned school bus hit by a train and volunteers were made up with fake blood and had to be assessed and rushed to hospital. Anyway, not your usual sight on a wilderness trail.
The paths to Fontana were wet, muddy, slippery and just not fun. After a zero (and the electricity was off at the lodge) we have decided to hike on tomorrow even it looks like more rain on the way. We still had some clean laundry from the NOC so we won’t hold back and try not to be whimps about climbing up Shuckstack in the rain.
BAMA and I have enough food to power through the Smokies and it does look like sunny days ahead.

Others like Benny, Appolo, drifter, BAMA and Gonzo (and I) decided to wait out one more day as sunshine was predicted 100% for the rest of the week.We grabbed our spot early in the shelter because most assuredly it would fill up with incoming hikers seeking refuge from the rain. That night was the worst night ‘s sleep ever!! 29 people crammed into the shelter and there was loud snoring, people getting up and down, and headlamps coming on at all hours.

Another mile as we entered the National Park and deposited our hiking permits in the assigned box. The climb up up Shuckstack was hard! It was very humid and very muddy... so these miles were a challenge. Just about all day was an upward climb and the mucous that had settled in my chest left me wheezing and coughing all day and a weakness to my legs I had not experienced yet in this hike. BAMA and I both have hiked the Smokies several times and were frustrated when the shelter seemed further away than remembered... up and up and up!! Finally we arrived and I was happy as a clam when I discovered the shelter was full which meant I could set up my tent. Rangers make sure we fill the shelter to capacity first. I went to bed early in a little remote spot but soon I was surrounded by late arriving hikers and my sweet little paradise became a tent city!

Bama and I were in such indecision about continuing on after my house sold while I was hiking.I couldn’t sleep for worrying about all the details and the need to find a new home to move into. So Bama called her hubby and we were picked up the next afternoon at Newfound Gap. Of course it was a glorious day as far as weather goes. Blue blue sky and perfect temps for some quick hiking.The open hillsides were thick with spring flowers and the trail had eased up a little after the previous few strenuous days. Some of our fellow hikers hiked on to Charlie’s Bunyon and it was too hard to say goodbye... so I didn’t.But after returning home I got moved out of one home and into another (hopefully my last move).. my attorney calls me ‘the serial mover ‘.Am excited to say on Wednesday I am meeting up with Catchup to complete Connecticut and Massachusetts. I have never laid eyes on this 120 mile section so I am very excited! After this hike I will be down to about 65 miles to have finished the trail. It is a must for me to complete every mile, even though it’s taking me more trail visits than expected. We all must ‘do us’ so I will enjoy my miles as I have chances to do them.","Mollies Ridge

Ahhhh, so happy!But Kent didn’t take it as easy on us as I planned. Starting just north of the town we’re some ‘toughish’ climbs and rock scrambling that were hard on a body that hasn’t hiked since late April.But the breezes cooled the sweat on my face and the level paths in other areas made the day a winner. Catch-up and I both had minor injury-watches so we took it pretty easy but didn’t take many breaks.The sun was brilliant blue and we picked up a few beautiful feather for Catchup ‘s grandson collection.We met south boulder Gandolphin who was hiking with a hand carved hiking pole given to him at Katahdin because he lost his poles. That hiking stick was given to him by a North bounder who finished the 2,185 miles... now it was being carried back to Springer.

Our group woke up to a 59 degree morning and I was feeling motivated!Cargo Master dropped us off at the trail and as usual it as an ascending trail. But it was not so bad .  We climbed upward for two hours but it was very tolerable because the grade was gradual.  Right off the bat a huge Barred owl swooped from one tree to the other. He was a grand sight! Rocky, Catchup and I had a fun morning switching off the lead and the end of the morning brought a very steep and tricky descent down to Salisbury. But Catchup’s foot held up and after a lunch of sandwiches, chips and chocolate (yum to Lindors and thanks cargo Master!!)Catchup and I climbed up and for our second ascent and this one I did not like. It was steep and long to the top of Lionhead and I was sweating a ton. On the way up I met a Sobo named Tomato. So to quickly introduce him to my hiking buddy I said “Tomato, Catchup”.... then we all laughed out loud. After Lionhead I hiked up over a ridge and a beautiful gray fox dart across the path and he was stealthy and hid somewhere very quickly. I couldn’t find him but I love those unexpected sightings.Catchup and I wanted to make it to the Massachusetts border but the climb up Bear ... well, it WAS a Bear!!!

It would have been perfect except for one thing..... armies of mosquitoes!! They were relentless and before we knew it we all had itchy bites. Cargo Master received Catchup’s distress signal and came to the rescue with bug repellent. After the spray-down we hiked on with less and less bites.Today’s terrain was so much easier (more like moderate hiking) so we knocked out the miles before we knew it! After lunch we had a steep climb and half way up ‘north meets South’ as a nobo hiker Avocado met up with us and a sobo named Chugs. After our conversation Catchup and I are hiking along and I looked up and spotted a beautiful wasp nest.

After three miles I looked on the ground and saw a perfect white blaze on some tree bark that had fallen from its tree trunk! Quite incredible. So I carefully picked it up and tucked it in a large baggie I had. Hope it survives getting back to Hilton Head. It will be nicely framed.Now the sweat was pouring and my clothes were soaked. I kept dipping my buff in cold streams and applying it to my head. When Catchup and I came to Upper Goose Pond we saw a perfect spot to enter the water. We stripped off our clothes and had the MOST refreshing dip in the cold water.
