This is what I've ended up with as my kit after several years of backpacking in scouts.
Things to note:
Not pictured: bear bag system, sunscreen/bug spray, alcohol stove fuel (we use Heet), ATC guidebook (used along with guthook's maps on my phone for navigation), the mountain of calorie-dense food in our living room.Only half the tent is shown because my brother opted to carry the poles and stakes while he's with me.Stove is a pop can stove like from zenstoves.net, along with an old girl scout cookset pot. I've also got a little setup made of titanium that provides extra support to the pot since the stove itself isn't very wide or stable.The Nemo tent is 2 person but that's definitely a backpacking 2 person. Overall I love it though, Nemo packs a lot of smart and helpful little features into their tents, and it's the right balance of size and weight for my purposes.Backpack is an Osprey Exos 48, towards the lighter end of traditional packs with frames. I like what Osprey does with their gear as well.We treated all of our clothes with Permethrin to combat the ticks, which are apparently pretty bad this year. I'm also bringing tweezers for the inevitable tick-removal process.We will be filtering all of our water with a Katadyn Befree, which should get rid of everything but viruses. We bought a ton of Potable Aqua chlorine dioxide tablets to take care of viruses since we'd really rather not get caught in the Norovirus breakout that sometimes spreads along the AT.I'm taking my phone for pictures on this trip but NOT my Nikon DSLR (which I have taken to Philmont and other trips) because my phone takes good enough pictures, the DSLR setup is heavy, and I want to focus on being in the moment rather than always trying to catch the best photo of every moment along the trail.The dark bags at the upper right are my Enlightened Equipment revelation 30Â° 850fp quilt (which I highly recommend) along with my Thermarest neoair xtherm pad. This is a pretty warm weather setup but it's also fairly light so I don't mind taking it, even if some nights it will be too hot for the quilt at all.The bag and stuff in the upper middle between the filter, camelbak, and claritin is my bath setup. A flat-bottomed waterproof bag from a local store, a washcloth, a sponge, and concentrated campsuds (plus some water) is everything I need to get rinsed off after a hot day of hiking.Boots are the Salomon Quest 4D 3 GTX. We'll see if my feet get too hot but I want the extra support for my ankles as we pass through the rocky areas of the trail.
That should cover it all. Max weight with 4 liters of water and a full resupply of food should be a bit over 30lbs - I'll confirm on start day. That means most days my weight will be fluctuating in the twenties.",,View Entry,"Jun 02, Sat",0
"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593682,"After many months of research and preparation, I'm currently en route to Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, so that tomorrow I can start my two-month long adventure on the Appalachian Trail. In many ways, however, this trip started many years before. My mother tells the story of the day when, in her words, she knew she was in trouble with two adventurous sons. Approximately nine years ago, when my brother was a young scout of Troop 516, two young men of the troop invited all of the scouts to watch a presentation they were giving about their thruhike of the Appalachian Trail. My brother was inspired to do something similar; from that idea hatched a plan that slowly grew into my brother's graduation trip. The summer after his high school graduation, he and a fellow Eagle Scout, along with a trustworthy and experienced scoutmaster, embarked on a 3,000 mile bike ride from the Pacific Ocean in California to the center of our town in Ohio.From the beginnings of my brother's trip planning, I knew I was similarly inspired to do a trip between graduating high school and starting college. Reading (and watching the movie versions of) ""A Walk in The Woods"" by Bill Bryson and ""Wild"" by Cheryl Strayed as well as countless other journal entries by my brother and thruhikers of various trails only furthered my thirst for adventure. The decision to hike the Appalachian Trail developed for several reasons:While the Pacific Crest Trail, which I originally wanted to hike, is more mountainous and arguably has better views, it is also longer and more expensive to travel to as well as more rugged and challenging to hike.The AT makes is easier for others to join me for time on the trail.I'm not as experienced of a biker as my brother, so a hike works best for me.Additionally, the AT is only becoming more and more popular, and has growing issues related to an increasing number of people attempting to use the lands. I want to hike as much of the AT as I can before it becomes ""too busy"". In the future I'd like to hike a new and remote trail as well.
After attending orientation and leaving myself with two weeks to get ready for college when I return home, I'm left with 8 weeks for a trip. In this time frame, I've estimated that I can hike close to 700 miles. I decided to start from Delaware Water Gap, near the border of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, so that I have an opportunity to see some of the more interesting parts of the trail and so I can have time to get in shape before some of the more elevation-intensive parts in Vermont and New Hampshire.
This trip serves a few purposes. One, I like camping and the outdoors. Two, I like being physically fit and anything that pushes my limits. Three, I'm looking forward to spending time with those who will be joining me. And finally, I need a break. I work myself hard during the school year, and the most recent summers haven't been a huge break either (70 miles of running a week plus working a 40hr work week anyone?). While I'm definitely looking forward to college, I worked my butt off in high school and I'm looking forward to relaxing my mind for a while so I don't burn out in college.Thanks for reading!P.S. I promise my journals will be shorter to read in the future!",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Sun",0
"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593684,Today was travel day. We slept in a little this morning to rest up before the long car ride (9 hours +). We went through a bit of rain and fog and some traffic slow downs but overall made it safe. The first hotel we were going to stay at had no hot water and we did NOT want our last shower before the trail to be cold so we found another hotel. We are finally all packed and ready to go for the trail tomorrow. I'm excited to start making mileage entries!,,View Entry,"Jun 10, Sun",0
"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594260,"Today we completed our first miles on the trail. After checking one last time to make sure we didn't leave anything important out of our backpacks and taking the last warm shower for a while at the hotel, we drove out to Delaware Water Gap. Our parents walked with us across the bridge over the Delaware River, which is also the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border. The first thing we noticed about the trail is that the rocks suck. We're both glad we skipped Rocksylvania. My feet hurt and my boot soles are thick, I don't know how Eric is surviving in his less supportive boots.We also saw some cool balancing rock gardens today. We had lunch at Sunfish pond where we used our water purifying system for the first time (the lake water tasted alright) and met some flipfloppers. Due to our start location and date we're a bit ahead of the main bubble but in the flipflopper bubble (or ""flubble"", as another hiker called it). We saw a helicopter fly real low above us along one of the many ridge lines we've been walking.Late in the afternoon we stopped at the Catfish Fire Tower and talked with AMFog and Carl. We decided to hike a little shorter than planned that so we could camp closer to water. Our first bear bag hang was a success too.

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594261,"We (meaning me) were a little slow to get ready this morning, but we needed the rest last night after a long first day. We started out with a quick 4 miles without too many rocks (which I liked and Eric loved). We also passed some beaver ponds and dams this morning, and a cool rock section that was a lot more bouldering-like than anything else we've seen. We ate lunch at Crater lake, where we could air our feet out and watch frogs jump around in the weeds in front of us for a relaxing break. The helicopter from yesterday flew over again.A little later we met Poobear and listened to her false broken bone story with Produce and Chili Dog, who definitely have their legs by now and are a bit faster than us. The climb up Rattlesnake Mountain was steep but short and came with a wide open view at the top. We decided to stop at the Brink Road Shelter (which is known for its mosquito problem) since we're sore from yesterday. We went to the tent before sunset to avoid the worst of the mosquitoes! I enjoyed looking at the shelter log before heading to bed. I'm typing this while stuck in the tent hiding from the bugs trying not to pass out from the smell of the socks we have hanging in here. Eric says mine smell worse... much worse.

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594262,"We slept in again this morning, and thankfully the rain that came while we were packing up was very light. First few miles there was a lot of fog and it was very humid. On our way through Branchville we stopped at Gyp's Tavern for some nice greasy burgers and to try to find more fuel for our stove (we use Heet antifreeze cause it's essentially ethanol). A friend of Poobear (Veneve?) said she was planning on sending her alcohol stove home so she gave us what she had left. One of the tavern workers also heard our search for fuel and mentioned her husband was making a stop in the next town over which has an autozone. He was able to pick up some Heet for us before he drove back, for which we were very thankful.On the way out of town we passed another fire tower. The stone pavilion at the top of Sunrise Mountain was cool, both to look at and temperaturewise from the wind!We passed the Mashipacong shelter and talked to Fox (who we had seen a lot before but not learned his trail name), Mariposa, and some more section hikers. We also saw some old decrepit rock walls scattered throughout the woods. We filled up at the wrong steam at the Rutherford shelter but it turned out alright after filtering. A storm is approaching and we expect a long day tomorrow so we've battened down the hatches and are trying to get some good sleep in.

New wildlife seen: Some deer we spooked, at least a hundred chipmunks, some small orange salamanders (or geckos? or maybe newts? what's the difference?), and a fox!"," Brink Road shelter (mile 1319.5)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594287,"Though it stormed last night it was a beautiful sunny morning while we packed up. This morning we also learned what a ""moldering"" privy was. We talked with Sunshine and Summer Breeze, and their awesome dog Nelly Wilson before heading out. Soon after leaving we crossed Dutch Shoe Rock. It was a nice view, even though we didn't find any rocks that looked like shoes, let alone Dutch ones. We also started crossing pastures today, including mini wooden ladders that lead humans over the dividing fences. We passed the High Point state park HQ before lunch, and took the (steep!) side trail to get to New Jersey's high point later in the day for some great views and a better quad workout. We also passed the ""Secret Shelter"" in the afternoon but didn't stop by to save time. We met another flip flopper heading there who called us LASHers - Long Ass Section Hikers!In the evening we reached the small village of Unionville, where we were able to buy a little more food at a general store named Horler's. We then positively stuffed ourselves on a large Sicilian pizza from Annabelle's, the local pizza joint (and still had leftovers!). We talked with Fox for a while and many of the town locals. We had mentioned to Fox earlier that we didn't have trail names yet, and he suggested The Wright Brothers, as we're two brothers from Dayton. We like the name so far but we'll see what other suggestions come up before confirming.Today is both the highest and lowest we've been on our trip, besides our start in Delaware Water Gap.","Rutherford shelter (mile 1334.5)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594486,"We had a nice start to our day with breakfast sandwiches from the village deli, then headed back to the trail from town. The miles today continued along the NJ-NY border. There's so much flora here that the shade in the woods is often tinted green by the sun. We walked through/around the Walkill Wildlife Refuge which was unshaded and hot in the sun, but thankfully we got some good miles in because it was so flat. Plus we saw swans hiding in the marshes, and plenty of other loud wetland birds. We then took the tough climb up Pochuck Mountain (and past many snakes) and stayed at elevation for a while before dropping back down to Vernon Valley. In the valley we walked on several lengthy boardwalks while planes headed west out of NYC for the weekend passed overhead. We saw some cows on the way to Heaven Hill Farms for a nice ice cream break. We needed it, because the ""Stairway to Heaven"" climb afterwards really wore us down. We talked more about our trail names and decided that I'll be Orville and Eric will be Wilbur (of the Wright Brothers) since Wilbur was older and taller.Upon entering the Wawayanda shelter camp we got to know Ole better, who we had met yesterday. The shelter was open so we set up our tent in it and enjoyed the extra space to lay things out. I have some blisters on my left foot but hopefully they'll go away with the moleskin and lotion I put on.","Unionville, NY (mile 1346.2)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594487,"We had a nice relaxed start to our day and slept in since we knew we were taking a nero day. A minibear (as the chipmunks are called at Philmont) visited us during breakfast wanting snacks. The ones we see along the trail chirp at us all the time like we've surprised them! We hiked the 0.5 miles to Warwick Turnpike to be picked up by Josie's taxi. There was a bit of confusion on where we were getting picked up, so Wilbur made a small rock tower like like the ones we've been seeing to pass the time. Josie was very friendly and told stories of past hikers she's driven as well as gave us info on Warwick. We checked into the motel and partook in the standard hiker refresh of a hot shower, laundry, and not walking a step more than we had to for a few hours. We then walked through town to get to the local Thai place for dinner and took a ride to restock before relaxing for the evening and checking in with home base. I also stayed up too late catching up on trail journaling...","Wawayanda shelter (mile 1363.0)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594503,"We ate a quick breakfast and tried to catch up on the vitamin C and dairy we've been missing on the trail before taking Josie's back to the trail. We crossed into NY and took a break to celebrate by eating some cookies. Soon after at Prospect Rock we got a view of the NYC skyline in the distance and saw plenty of planes heading in for the work week. The rocks continue into New York but now are more bouldering than foot stabbing, which both Wilbur and I enjoy more. We passed Furnace Brook, which forms a mini waterfall and was about the only natural source of water that was flowing today. It has been hot today and will only be worse tomorrow. Pushed by hazy dreams of cold ice cream in the heat, we found an oasis at Bellvale Creamery, which had a charging station, water spigot (no purification needed!), and some seriously good ""Bellvale Bog"" ice cream. Refueled after a siesta/food coma, we quickly made it to the Wildcat shelter. We talked with Old Scout before he took a nap, and Sunshine and Summer Breeze showed up as well. We're leaving the fly off tonight in the hopes that it'll help keep us cool.","Warwick Motel (mile 1363.5)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594643,"We were beat from the heat yesterday so we slept in. Soon after heading out we found Fitzgerald Falls, a 25 foot cascading falls and a great source of water to drink from and to cool off with. Along the trail we noticed that we've entered the area of New York that was hit by a storm and has many blown down trees. After lunch the temperature continued to climb, the trail continued to get steeper, and the miles continued to pass slower. Thankfully some trail angels had seen the approaching heat wave and laid out water jugs at many of the road crossings today! Thank you Tuxedo Angels, The Hikerman, and Susan!It was humid enough to see how thick the air was during views to the next mountain over. Beginning to drag, we found a nice reprieve when we came upon some hikers taking a dip to cool off in one of the lake outlets we crossed today and joined them for a nice break. We adjusted our camping plans for the night so that we didn't have to hike as far. Still, the rest of the day took longer than expected due to rocky climbs including Arden Mountain, Green Mountain (arguably the most beautiful today) and ""Agony Grind"".Finally we reached our stealth camp for the night at Island Pond, where we took a quick dip at the boat entry point before setting up camp for the night, including bear bags for the first time in a while. At least we didn't have to stay at Fingerboard Shelter a a few miles ahead, where supposedly a bear and her two cubs get at least a food bag per night!As I type this we are laying in the tent too hot to fall asleep, hoping the incoming rain will cool things down.
Wildlife seen: a baby deer, two racoons we caught climbing a tree, a wild turkey, plenty of reptiles enjoying the sun, some fuzzy caterpillars.Edit: On the first day I asked Eric who would be the first to fall.

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595004,"Today still had some elevation change, but was so much better than yesterday. We definitely entered a new type of climate yesterday starting at Green Mountain. With more open and grassy forests as well as more flat rock sections that we call sidewalks, it's my favorite so far. Thankfully after a bit of rain last night some of the creeks are refreshed too. Early in the day we passed ""Lemon Squeezer"", a tricky and tight rock formation, as well as an old iron mine.Throughout the day we kept hearing boom noises even though there were no storms approaching. A quick search told me that the sounds were coming from artillery exercises from nearby West Point, but another article about some different explosions in the 1930s caught my eye, and I read the fascinating article over the course of a mile. Here's the link for an interesting read:http://www.myharriman.com/trea...
I laced my boots differently today and i think it's solved my foot problems.Today we also passed the 100 mile mark at the William O'Brien shelter, which is about 5 percent of the trail.We took our maximum capacity for water up West Mountain since the shelter at the top is dry. It was difficult but definitely worth the view of the Hudson River Valley at NYC skyline! There are many other hikers here tonight too.We ran out of the alcohol fuel for our stoves so Wilbur had oatmeal for dinner and I had to cold soak my pasta, which isn't desirable.Before heading to bed I looked at the skyline, planes, and stars with another hiker named Galaxy and heard his plans to start a nonprofit with his wife once they finish the trail.
As I type this we have the rainfly off the tent and are enjoying the night sky but trying to ignore the sounds of many whippoorwills and trains so that we can fall asleep
Wildlife seen: A young buck who didn't seem to bothered by us, a tiny inch worm (Wilbur called him a 1/16-of-an-inch worm), more reptiles enjoying the sun, and a bunch of tiny baby frogs that must've been born near one part of the trail - so numerous it felt like the ground was moving!","Island Pond (mile 1386.6)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595005,"In the morning we decided we were dirty enough to warrant a motel stay so we booked a room at the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel. The shuttle was scheduled to leave at noon so we had to book it out of camp and over Bear Mountain, which we thankfully were able to do since our packs were light and ready for a resupply and because the trail for this section was in great condition. We found out on other side of mountain that this is because Bear Mountain is used as an example for good trail building.We passed the restored Bear Mountain Inn and took the shuttle to the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel with the owner's father, who was very funny and we got to know throughout the day. It turned out to be a fantastic stay as the entire family of the owner is friendly. We had the local barbecue for lunch and dinner, restocked on groceries (which we probably bought too much of because we were hungry) and managed to find ice cream too. I even splurged a bit and bought some yerba mate, a drink I learned about in Spanish class. For several days on the trail we won't spend a dollar, then when we head into town it's like we go on a shopping spree! We tried to find fuel in town but couldn't, however a place we will pass tomorrow has denatured alcohol we can use (which they mispronounced as ""dentured"" alcohol over the phone).I read a trail journal for the PCT and was impressed.

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595055,"Soon along the trail today we passed the large Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson. It reminded me of the ending scene of the movie Wild. Our lunch spot today was the Appalachian Market, which is small but has plenty of snacky food items for hikers. One thing that's been evident along the hike is that throughhikers are a different breed of person. In the time it took for us to eat lunch (and get italian ice, of course) we watched one guy smoke three cigarettes and drink both a large beer and an entire 2liter of orange crush soda... hiker hunger is real. Also we were able to find the fuel we need there, which we tested for dinner and worked great.In the afternoon we passed a hilltop shrine from the local friary that lets people stay in their campground. It was broken down and in disuse, and there was a sign in the middle reading ""Jesus es mi camino"", in English ""Jesus is my walk/journey"". A fitting saying, I think, for being along the path of such an incredible walking journey.
I've been thinking more about that PCT journal that I read yesterday. In some ways the PCT and AT are very different. The AT is a much more popular and social trail. Along the trail you introduce yourself to hundreds of people and get to know them different amounts. In repeating this stage of interaction so much you get to see a glimpse of yourself from the outside, as others view you. But just like with any trail, there's plenty of time for solitude, when you travel the miles silently with only your thoughts rattling around in your head. The trail is a big contrast; sometimes Wilbur and I can go two hours without saying more than a few words, or sometimes we'll tell stories or quote TV shows (specifically SpongeBob) for several miles. Sometimes, like on hot days, the hiking goes by excruciatingly slow. On the other hand, we repeat a lot of our actions each day in the process of taking down and setting up camp, and sometimes the days seem to meld together. As I wrote in a log book recently: Hiking - the day passes slowly, but the days slip away

This morning when taking down our bear bag we realized that we bought so much food that the extra weight bent the pen we use for our setup... oops. At a water spigot we passed this morning there were remnants of an old building we think was a church. Further along we walked along an old stone turnpike that used to be for hauling ore carts from the mines. It's fun to let your mind wander and imagine what was happening here 200 years ago. Later we passed what must be a snake breeding ground because we saw 8 snakes within an hour!I ate lunch on a road guard rail with a good view of Lake Canopus. We enjoyed watching the hawks float on thermals around us while we took a break at Shenandoah Mountain.We're at RPH shelter tonight and it's pretty deluxe since it's maintained by a really active group of volunteers.

Soon after RPH shelter we passed an area through which the tornado from a couple weeks ago must have passed because nearly all the trees had fallen. But thanks to the wonderful work of a bunch of volunteers, the trail was cleared and easy to pass. We stopped for early lunch at a deli and enjoyed some good sandwiches, tater tots, and our first chocolate milk in a while.Water seems pretty scarce in this section. We even passed but couldn't drink the water from Nuclear Lake because it was a plutonium research facility in the 70s, which I enjoyed reading about online.The fog started to roll in during the afternoon and the last view of the day was completely hidden by a white wall.

We first hiked a quick half mile to the Dover Oak, the oldest and largest oak tree on the AT. It's crazy to imagine what this tree has seen in the over 250 years that it's been alive. From there we got a ride to and from the supermarket in Pawling to restock. Afterwards we walked along another boardwalk section before crossing train tracks, which appear to even have a mini station to stop at the AT.We crossed plenty of pastures and fencehoppers today. We've also seen some boy scout troops out on weekend trips. Maybe some of them will find themselves on a trip like this in a few years too.It rained for our first time today. First it started out lightly and I resisted putting on my pack cover. Then it started harder and I relented but didn't put on rain gear. It felt nice to let the rain wash away the miles of sweat. Thankfully we got into camp and set up the tent just before the heavy stuff hit. At least with 10 of us packed into a shelter we got to know everyone in camp quickly. Hopefully the water sources will be replenished and the bugs will be not as bad for a few days.In the evening we played cards in the shelter. In the time between two waves of rain we started a fire and some people even did some ""shelter yoga"". I forgot how much I love making fire. The moon even came out after the rain stopped and while I was watching the coals burn out, turning it into a beautiful night.

After passing into Connecticut, we climbed Ten Mile Hill and enjoyed the view at the top while eating lunch. Since the clouds from last night had passed it was a beautiful day. While headed towards Kent we passed some cool bridges over the many rivers that meet and split in this area, including an 18th century covered bridge. We are staying at a cabin on a couple's property that is right on the Housatonic River. They have a second cabin and their basement that they rent out during the summer as well. They have been very kind to us (they figured out how to pipe in hot water to the sink with only 24 hours notice!) and we appreciate them taking us in while we're so smelly. Meeting people like this really encourages me to find a way to do something similar when I own a house.

We gave them some bug spray that was very much needed tonight and in exchange they gave us a lighter since mine broke and some cheese since they have extra food.While getting ready for bed I made good use of the brook flowing near this campsite and enjoyed a moonlight foot soaking in the cold water while watching the lightning bugs put on a light show.The shelters in Connecticut seem really nice so far.I realized that it's been a month since I graduated high school. It's hard to understand that my summer is more than a third over already. This summer certainly feels different than all my other summers before have.

Mine is 28 pounds and Wilbur's is 25. I think it has something to do with the fact that he has already eaten all of his snacks and is starting to scrounge off of mine. I'm going to send a few items home when Wilbur leaves so we will see how much weight that cuts.We walked along the river for a while more this morning before finally climbing again. I enjoyed using the swinging bench that I found on our first break.Now that we're well into Connecticut many of the forests are full of pines and birches. Many of the water sources so far have been called brooks instead of streams. I'm not sure what the exact difference is but all of these books have been the perfect size for filling up water and soaking feet so I like them.We heard loud cars in the distance on one mountain. When we got to a viewpoint we realized we were above a valley with a racing track.We cut down break time in the afternoon to try to beat an approaching storm to camp.

This morning that came in the form of rain. It seems that something must be wrong with our tent, because we woke up to a wet floor, to the point that there was a puddle in the downhill corner. But hey, as another hiker we met today said, ""No pain, no gain, no Maine"".After sleeping in, we packed up quickly and made the three miles to Toymaker's cafe for brunch. We were hungry after the miles without breakfast and together managed to eat a large omelette, toast, bacon, a large cinnamon waffle, three crepes, a cinnamon roll, French toast, and two special British sodas.Soon after we came upon Great Falls. What a sight to behold! With all the recent rain the falls were loud and intense.Climbing up Mount Prospect we saw lightning from a nearby storm, which did not make us excited to be climbing, but thankfully it stayed at bay. At elevation we found some interesting points, including a wide open field with an amazing view and a large rock called Giant's Thumb.Around dinnertime we stopped into Salisbury to restock and eat dinner. Knowing we only need two days' worth, we were able to pig out again and also buy some oddities that normally don't survive the trail well. We avoided yet another rain shower by eating under a balcony at the grocery. I even had enough sandwich for a nighttime snack while enjoying the rising full moon once we got to camp.We made the climb up Lion's Head while refueled, the highest point we've been to in a while. Some crows enjoyed the sunset view with us at the top.In the forests this evening we saw two trees fall down near us. I think all the heavy rain in the past 24 hours is bringing down anything that's dead. The water sources also show evidence of the precipitation - the trail is full of puddles and there are streams flowing that aren't marked on the map, even high up mountains.","Belter's campsite (mile 1490.7)

Right out of camp we started the climb up Bear Mountain (yes, another one). The rocky summit, at 2316 feet, is more than 500 feet taller than our last high point, in New Jersey. On the way down Wilbur finally had his first fall on some slippery rocks (and I've had at least 3 by now). We descended for a while and went through Sage's Ravine, full of cool little waterfalls, pools, and rock formations. Upon leaving the ravine we officially crossed into Massachusetts having completed our third whole state.In the afternoon we headed up Mt. Race, another new high point. Rocky edges lead to the summit, meaning we got to walk for more than half a mile with the complete right side of our view full of beauty. We set our current high point going up Mt. Everett, a climb so difficult the trail crew has drilled on wooden steps to the rocks in several places.The trails have been watery today from all the rain. In some places we practically walked through small streams for hundreds of yards!We leapfrogged Happy and another group of hikers today. We got to know them once we reached camp as Grandpa Wizard (who thruhiked 9 years ago) and his brother, who are also both eagle scouts.

First we went along the ridgeline over Mt. Bushnell and to Jug End, which has great views to the north. Then we descended steeply to our pickup road, as we've found that the AT tends to do.Soon enough our dad (trail name TBD) picked us up and we headed into town to eat, restock, and sort through all the gear to make sure our dad has what he needs to join us for a while. For dinner we even went to a Peruvian place, though unfortunately I didn't get a chance to practice my Spanish. I've been missing speaking with someone out loud - I'll often think in Spanish along the trail, but that can get lonely. Some hiker recently brought up the Camino de Santiago trail in Spain, which really sounds like a trip I'd like to do in the future.We're going to try to get up early the next few days. With the heat index predicted to be over 100 for a while, we're going to try to get our miles done in the morning or take a siesta each day.Since this was Wilbur's last day on the trail, I just wanted to give him a shoutout for making sure I had a good start to the trip and for being crazy enough to be with me for three weeks straight.","The Hemlocks shelter (mile 1513.7)

Soon enough my dad (who has taken the name of Bear Bait for now) and I headed off. The first part of the day was through an area known as mosquito valley, which was flat but very swampy and therefore lived up to its name. We also passed the Shay's Rebellion monument this morning, which I somewhat remember from APUSH.We reached the milestone today of completing the first section of the map in my guide app.In the afternoon we had a steep climb out of the valley, made even more difficult by the rising temperatures. We decided to take a siesta to avoid hiking during the hottest part of the day, during which I was able to catch up on posting trail journals. When looking from the mountain tops we could see how thick the air was today with humidity. We saw many other hikers who started early or very late in the day to avoid the heat, including one I haven't seen since my first week. While in camp I showed Bear Bait all the backpacking tips and tricks Wilbur and I have grown accustomed to using.

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596543,"We rose early with the sun to try to beat the heat. One of the water sources for our camp last night was down a steep rocky ravine which I think was the lower end of Ice Gulch, which we passed soon after camp. The gulch forms a sort of wind tunnel that is always in the shade, and is at least 20 degrees colder than its surroundings. It was really bizarre to feel it last night and this morning in comparison to the hot weather we're having.I met a southbound hiker who is also hiking a large section of the trail the summer before he goes to college. He lives in Pennsylvania and has a goal of hiking back home, and is going to try to walk barefoot until he hits the Pennsylvania border! It's cool to know that I'm not the only one who thought to turn this summer into an awesome trip.We stopped at the South Mount Wilcox shelters for lunch. There are actually two shelters here. We ate in the old one, which was built in the 1930s and is still used, with Chili, Stripper, and another hiker.
The camp we were going to stay at tonight supposedly has a problem bear and cubs, so we made a plan with everyone else at lunch to all stealth camp at an opening for a gas line that is next to a water source a little ways past the campsite.
I believe that Bear Bait has officially earned his nickname now. In the 20 days that I was with Wilbur, we didn't see a single bear. In fact, I had never seen a bear in the wild before at all. Within 36 hours of Bear Bait picking his name, we saw a momma bear and her three cubs on our way to pass through Shaker campsite.Â  A local runner came upon us while we were making noise to try to scare them off (which didn't work at all) and described the shortest roadwalk we could take to bypass the bears. Soon on our walk, however, he pulled up in his car and offered to give us a ride since it was getting late! He even had fresh grapes for us to eat, which were absolutely delicious. Trail magic really provided what we needed at the time and I'm super grateful for the local's generosity. We are now stealth camped an extra two miles away from the bears near two noisy but soothing streams to fall asleep to.

At our second road crossing we found some trail magic and were able to enjoy some camp chairs and nice cold sodas in the heat. Chili and Stripper showed up and we were able to explain our bear story and why we didn't show up to camp last night. Another hiker named Tunes showed up and we realized he was the one set up in camp when we came upon the bear. We also met some thruhikers averaging 30 a day and hoping to be done by the end of July.We met many dayhikers on the way to Goose Pond who made us excited for our stay at the cabin. We even met a guy with an injured baby squirrel in his hipbelt pocket who was taking it to his veterinarian friend.The pond absolutely lived up to the hype. The cabin has bunks upstairs so we didn't have to set up our tent and there is a beautiful lake with a dock to sit on nearby. There we learned how Tunes got his name when he played guitar and sang to us while we swam in the clear water. The fish will try to nibble on your feet if you sit still for long enough! Another hiker, Picasso, showed us her beautiful artwork and was working on making a drawing of the lake. Soon after we got a bit of early 4th of July celebration in when a party pontoon boat showed up from a connecting lake. The owner picks up hikers to hang out with his friends on his boat on nice days! We had plenty of fun and even did flips off the top of the boat. The cabin has a nice front porch where we talked with an awesome crowd of hikers during dinner. Afterwards I took a canoe with Chili and Stirling to the island in the middle of the lake to look at the rock garden and watch the sunset. Many hikers stayed over from last night and took a zero or stayed late into the day for a nero, and I can see why. This place is beautiful! It's a regular Hotel California.

We've been doing that a lot cause they're great places for breaks. That combined with canoeing last night makes me want to travel back to Boundary Waters for another canoe trip sometime.We arrived to camp pretty early today.

We did share stories while cooking with Four Leaf, who rises late and nighthikes almost every day and was just passing through, and Sheep Dog, who does the opposite and gets up early and stayed in camp with us. One of the best parts about being out here is that everyone has stories to share.

However, that also meant that it was a little early to knock on the Cookie Lady's door when we passed by so we had to skip that.We saw another young bear scramble up a tree today, but thankfully no other bear showed up and this one was scared of us. We were able to pass under it without issue.We found some great blueberry bushes on top of Warner Hill while looking down into the valley of Pittsfield and Dalton.

We got a recommendation to stay at the Shamrock Village Inn from a fellow hiker and enjoyed getting to know the friendly owners. I think I've decided that the best part of trail life, even better than food and showers in town stops or beautiful views, is getting to know everyone around you doing the same thing. The number of incredible conversations I've had with people that I didn't know 24 hours ago is astounding. We ate dinner with Strider and Mud, who we just met at Upper Goose Pond. We got our recommendation for dessert from another father-son set of section hikers we met going SOBO today.

The climb up Greylock was steep and long, but the cool temperatures definitely helped us out. We stopped for a quick lunch and water refill at the Mark Noepel shelter and decided to push on.

He remembered being there when the original shelter materials were carried up the mountain by a helicopter!After lunch we continued to climb elevation. The forest changed a little before 3000ft, with the smell of spruce and fir evident in the air. Eventually we reached the summit, which has a lighthouse war memorial at the top and 360 degree views. Today sets my trip high point an additional 800 feet up. We decided to stay at the lodge on top of Graylock instead of pushing to the next shelter. My bunk has a fantastic view and there are showers and breakfast here so there were no complaints from me.After dinner we walked around the summit and spoke with other visitors, including one couple who was so interested in our trip that they gave us a free soda and trail snacks!Throughout the day I've been hearing one particular bird call that was particularly vocal at dusk. I was able to figure out that it is the white-throated sparrow.Some signs on the summit explained that above 2600 feet, the climate on Greylock becomes Boreal Forest because of how exposed the mountain is. The trees are stunted and the winter weather here is impressive. It's the only known area like this in Massachusetts, and is more similar to northern Canada than the surrounding area.As of tonight my trip is halfway over.

It was incredibly rocky and narrow, so I can see why.We stopped at Prospect Ledges for a little while and watched skydivers jump out of a plane and soar down to the city below us.Upon crossing some neighborhoods on our way through Williamstown, we found some bikes that are free for hikers to borrow to ride into town.

With a bit of cell service, we were able to figure out and reserve plans for the rest of my time with Bear Bait and the transition to my next set of hiking partners.I encountered a squirrel today near the summit of Glastonbury who actually stood his ground instead of being spooked away like most squirrels.

Many of the other people here are college age or older, and I didn't realize how much I missed speaking to someone my own age! Not too many people (besides Wilbur) love quoting SpongeBob while hiking as much as I do.We had a beautiful view from Prospect Rock of some far away mountain rain. Later on we decided to drop packs and go up a steep rock scramble to Spruce Peak for another view.About a mile out from our pickup point today I fell on some rocks and scraped up my shins. Like a true hiker I doused it in isopropyl alcohol later while at the hostel to clean it up.At the trailhead we met Sarah's mom, who gave us fresh fruit and drove us to the grocery store!Tonight we stayed at the Green Mountain House hostel, which has a great reputation on the trail. They do a great job of catering to what hikers need - they had a 1200 calorie serving of ice cream for $1! We met some other fascinating people while here, including an Australian couple, the owner (who used to be a Philmont ranger!), the man who puts together the Hiker Yearbook each year, and an older gentleman who has traveled all over - more of Australia even than the couple who lives there!","Stratton Pond shelter (mile 1641.2)

We cameled up at Bromley shelter, where we met some Australians and some Germans, before starting on an 8 mile dry section. After a lot of climbing we reached the wide open top of Bromley, which is a ski resort in winter. We're definitely in the heart of ski territory in Vermont - I started to see resorts on other mountains starting at Glastenbury, and we hiked up a ski run to the top of Bromley today. We dropped to another road then ascended to Styles Peak, which was very buggy. A cloud of dragonflies floated above us as we rested in the shade and enjoyed the view. We followed along the ridge through some really thick pine forest to Peru Peak before a long drop to tonight's shelter.The shelter tonight has a strong stream flowing and providing constant background noise.Sarah showed up again at the shelter. The only other people staying tonight are a young couple that's only been out for a few days.Yesterday I suggested the name Dirty Dan (a SpongeBob reference) for Sarah. It appears to have stuck, which was cool hiker moment because I've never given someone a trail name before.Before dinner we went swimming in nearby Griffith Lake. It was a great swimming spot, and small enough to swim to a boulder (rock?) on the other side and enjoy the peace for a few moments.","Manchester Center (mile 1651.8)

I arrived early since I joined Dirty Dan on the way there, who wanted to get 19 miles in.The climb up Baker Peak was difficult (and the slanted rocks remind me of New York a lot), but open ledges proved to come with great views again. We then descended to a large suspension bridge over Big Branch, which proved to be a great spot to eat lunch, soak our feet, and skip rocks. I was a bit bored the rest of the day with 10 free hours, but I was able to keep somewhat busy by reading the entire trail log, catching up on journaling, and speaking with others who passed by or are staying for the night. We met Pamby and Mad Tom, who are Long Trail section hikers, Zuzu, who is a thru, and Jeff and Laura, who have been doing short hikes and spreading some trail magic, which came tonight in the form of extra dessert!It's supposed to start pouring tonight into tomorrow. I realized that I haven't been through any big storms yet. As difficult as they can be to continue through, storms are often my favorite camping moments because they're so memorable.

It began to storm and got incredibly dark under the trees, but soon enough I was restocking food in the protection of a car. Bear Bait completed just short of 150 miles on the trail, which is worthy of a round of applause as it is far and above his original goal of 100 miles. Whoop whoop! Joining me are Andrew, a friend from cross country, and his dad.The rain stopped soon before we began hiking. We passed Little Rock pond, which looked beautiful and clear to swim in. The first rock garden we saw had been mostly knocked down so we decided to help rebuild it a little. The next one was the biggest I've seen on the trail, just before a side trail leading to the beautiful views of White Rocks. The forest looked amazing today in the fog.It seems that every state has a Bear Mountain, because we climbed my third one for the trip today. It began to pour as we reached the summit, but I realized that I really only have a couple items which can't get wet, and embraced the rain.We had a bit of excitement tonight at camp. We heard screams coming from the forest and went as a group to go check them out. We often joke that everyone out here is a little crazy to willingly hike the trail, but the noises were unfortunately originating from a man walking down the nearby dirt road who was either tripping or mentally troubled. We heard him lingering around the area for a while, but thankfully he seemed to have moved on by the time we went to sleep.We gave up on bearbagging after my rope got stuck and Mr Cameron's food bag attachment point broke.

Soon after leaving we found a nice view over the Rutland Airport. Rutland is most known on the trail for a place known as the Yellow Deli, one of the most popular hostels on the trail. The spiritual group that runs the place is particularly friendly to hikers, will let you work for stay, offers slackpacking, and serves great Yerba Mate! In fact, we met up with Bear Bait this morning to adjust some of the Camerons' gear, and he stayed there last night! (and said it was best described as ""groovy"". We've met many people using their slackpacking services throughout the day.The first big point of interest today was Clarendon Gorge. All three of us slipped on the short but damp and rocky descent! But the bridge over the river ended up being beautiful. The climb out was intense too, with lots of rock scrambling. Within a few miles we took a lunch break at Clarendon shelter, which was in a nice grassy clearing and had a cold stream for a quick soak.In the afternoon we passed some roads and meadows which all gave views of Killington towering above us. We reached some tall pines forests on cliffs above rivers at the base of the mountain. One small landslide had brought trees down that used to be right next to the trail. We took a break at Governor Clement shelter, the second oldest on the AT. The logbook had a picture of the shelter in a meadow when it was built, which was interesting since the landscape around it has changed significantly. Checking out the log book it seems that everyone headed up Killington today - there were nearly 20 logbook entries, many more than usual.Afterwards we began the long climb up Little Killington and Killington. At little Killington I passed my 400 mile mark. Killington is exciting because it's the first mountain on my section that's above 4000 feet!I ran hard the last mile and a half to the shelter then summit in just enough time to catch the sunset. The rock scramble up to the top was incredibly steep! (think double Philmont's Tooth of Time) but worth it.We found Dirty Dan again camped at the very summit of Killington since the shelter is in bad shape due to vandals during the ski season. I'm sharing a tarp with Andrew as a windblock. It's extremely windy up here!

One of the other people watching with us got up at 3am to hike up Killington in time!Dirty Dan hikes in a Hawaiian shirt, which I think is fun and reminds me of Tights Ties and Tiedye Tuesday and other cross country spirit week shenanigans. While talking about it she mentioned that she has a few extras and was meeting up with her mom to go into town today and that I could get a free one then! As I wrote in a logbook later, it's hard to be an unhappy hiker in a Hawaiian shirt and short shorts. Andrew and his Dad went ahead, while I took an easy morning with Dirty Dan. There was plenty of downhill to start the day since we started out so high up. Soon we reached where the AT/LT splits from Sherbourne Pass trail, which used to be the AT/LT until the new path was built, which ironically means that The Inn at Long Trail is now several miles off the Long Trail. The split also marked Dirty Dan's 100 mile mark, whoop whoop!At Route 4 I got my awesome hiking shirt and we said our goodbyes. I hiked to Maine junction for lunch, where the AT and LT actually separate. Many people recommend the northern half of the Long Trail so I definitely want to do it at some point in the future. I ended up taking another break in the afternoon at Gifford Woods state park since they had $1 orange cream bars, charging stations, and wifi to catch up on posting trail journals. I'll let you guess which one of those was the greatest motivation for staying as long as I did.I passed many standalone boulders today. Kent Pond was clear and sunny, which I'm sure the kayakers I saw enjoyed. Thundering Falls was mesmerizing to watch as the water cascaded down the sharp rocks. There was another long boardwalk section afterwards too, which I always like. I finally caught up to Andrew and his dad after I booked it up a long uphill climb. I was so tired that I took long enough of a break at the top though that I had to catch them again! I'm sure my body was a bit confused at my extremely inconsistent hiking speed today - I stayed in camp this morning for about 4 hours waiting, took 4 hour long breaks, and hiked a brisk 3mph when I was moving!As I write this we're listening to the sounds of (hopefully) Chipmunks run around in the woods in front of the shelter, which has had bear problems in the past.","Killington Peak (mile 1695.6)

Soon after leaving camp we had a ladder downclimb over some boulders, which I've been told to expect a lot of in the Whites. Feeling a little dehydrated at the first water source, Andrew and I channeled our cross country roots and raced to chug a liter in order to ""camel up"" on water. We passed The Lookout today, which is a private cabin but hikers are allowed to use it. It came with a steep ladder to an amazing view on the roof. We could see where we were (Killington), where the Long Trail goes, and the White Mountains where we're headed.We met a guy named Hook today while hiking who told us some funny stories about the truth shelter, where people go to reveal secrets in the logbook. We also ran into Oolong, a SOBO highschool graduate.We passed many beautiful hilltop fields on the way down to Route 12. There we got some fresh fruit and soda from Bear Bait and decided we wanted to head to a nearby restaurant. The burgers and ice cream definitely hit the spot.Tonight we're sleeping in a ""secret hostel"" - Dan, a kind man who owns a barn near the trail, lets hikers sleep in the top level. It feels like a secret club house and I enjoyed falling asleep under the rainbow lights strung across the ceiling.Crockett, another hiker we've been running into a lot, suggested the name Recliner for Mr. Cameron since he carries a comfy camp chair with him, which many hikers forego for weight reasons. Recliner decided that he will be taking a rest day tomorrow to get ready for the drive home, so Andrew and I have set our sights on a 30 mile day.

Andrew and I certainly acted unchained as we went 31.5 miles today to finish out Vermont and start into New Hampshire. I started off the morning with a quick outdoor shower at the barn to wake me up. We immediately had a steep climb to grassy fields, which continued throughout the day (and Andrew loved taking photos of). We passed Pomfret Road early in the morning, where we took a small detour to the porch of some past thruhikers. Even though it was early they came out to talk with us while we enjoyed some amazing whoopie pie and ice cream sandwiches they made!Our next break was at the Thistle Hill shelter to grab some water. The privy there was a very weird raised hexagon structure. It seems that the Dartmouth Outing Club, which maintains this section of trail, really enjoys quirky privy designs. The first town we passed was West Hartford, which has a bridge that you can jump off of. A trail angel with a house nearby called us over, and after getting some safety recommendations for him I jumped the 30 feet into the White River!We passed two interstates today, which is a rare occurrence. We're definitely getting along the trail as we're nearing the end of the interstate numbering system. We had a long roadwalk into Norwich, which was full of rich homes. One house even had a sprinkler going that we ran through. In town there was a carnival going on that we unfortunately didn't have time to stop by. Andrew and I had a good time watching the confused look of drivers in the upscale town passing by two stinky guys, one in a Hawaiian shirt and short shorts!We crossed a big bridge over the Connecticut River, making the end of Vermont. It's hard to believe that I only have one full state left in my trip! On the New Hampshire side of the river we reached Hanover. The Ivy League college town atmosphere was a bit of a culture shock compared to trail life. We enjoyed a nice break there with Gatorade and grapes from Bear Bait and Recliner before continuing on.We laid down in the grass on the Dartmouth athletic fields when we passed by since it just felt so nice. NH was a stark difference and we immediately noticed more rocks and roots. There was even a rope climb up one very steep rock face. As the sun set and our hike turned to night hiking, we put our headlamps on when we heard an animal that might have been a spooked bear. We passed through open fields and turned off our headlamps to enjoy the stars a few times. When we finally reached the pickup spot at around 11, Bear Bait and Recliner had a large pizza waiting for us! Andrew and I chowed down while headed back to our hotel rooms to crash. It feels like so much happened today since we passed much more along the trail than usual with the big miles.

Thanks so much to them for joining me and sharing the journey for a little while. Afterwards Bear Bait and I got a (very) late lunch at Lou's, which had an amazing breakfast, in addition to free muffins for hikers!With some free time we checkes out the Dartmouth campus, did some laundry, and restocked.

It was extremely humid, but at least it made me feel at home with my tropical shirt. My body is DEFINITELY still recovering from the 30 day even after a 0. All the views today were obscured by fog that brought rain. I met Wolverine, who also just graduated highchool, and Bear Hunter, one of his friends from cross country (sound familiar?) The trail is full of eagle scouts and cross country runners, two other disciplines that must match skills really well with backpacking. I hiked with them for a while and got to know them before I stopped for my late lunch to refuel before a big climb. I was rewarded at the top with Holt's Ledges, a really steep cliff that was cool to watch the clouds off of. Some people really hate shrouded foggy views, but I think it can be fun to wonder about the unknown world before me. There was even a fenced off section of the cliffs because there is a peregrine falcon nesting site there!I took an afternoon break at Trapper John shelter, which had a deluxe privy and a hilarious multipart multiauthor story about the trap life. The heavy rain has my feet soaked even with waterproof boots on. Today was first day that I feel my speed on the trail was really limited by safety since it was so wet. I reached the first rebar ladder in a while today too. I was planning on hiking further today, but with my late start when I reached the enclosed cabin on top of Smarts Mountain the sun was setting, I had been moving slow, and my feet and everything else was wet, so there was no way I was going to continue. My feet have started to blister in my boots. I am 100% moving to trailrunners without waterproofing in the future, cause my feet are dying in the wet boots that now will never dry out. I stayed the night with Wolverine, Bear Hunter, Makin' It, and Rex. Before heading to sleep I checked out the lookout tower, which was in the middle of a cloud.

I put plenty of tape on my feet to try to avoid blisters before putting on my wet socks and boots. I checked out the windy firetower again to see it in the daytime before heading up Mt. Cube with Wolverine and Bear Hunter. While doing so, a large tree branch fell on the trail only a few seconds after we had passed that point. The rock slabs continue to be wet and slick, slowing down progress. I also smacked one of my shins AGAIN, marking about the fifth time that I've scraped off skin on both of them.Lunch came with a bit of a reprieve from the rain, including a chance to tape my feet up again as well as meet Bear Bait to hand out trail magic. I also got a santa hat from him to prepare for Christmas in July tomorrow!We crossed three different NH Route 25s in the afternoon which were all differentiated by another letter, but was still confusing. The most exciting thing about climbing Mt. Mist is that I could see Moosilauke, the first big climb of the Whites! I had heard that there was ice cream not too far off trail at the Hikers Welcome Hostel. While there I found three gentleman who Bear Bait had given trail magic to during lunch, so they offered to put my ice cream on their tab!

I packed up pretty quickly and started hiking with my Christmas in July music ane santa hat before the rain hit. Additionally, I was thinking ahead last night at the hostel and got pterodactyl the trail angel to buy some small trail magic for me to hand out on my way up Moosilauke, so I really felt like trail Santa for the day and enjoyed telling everyone I passed Mele Kalikimaka in the spirit of my Hawaiian shirt. I found Wolverine and Bear Hunter slackpacking SOBO over Moosilauke from the hostel, which sounded tempting but I've never done. I also passed the 500 mile mark for my trip on the way up! That was my goal for total running miles last summer for cross country conditioning, so it feels great to go above and beyond that mark this summer. It felt amazing to reach my first ""real"" white mountain summit, even though it was incredibly windy and foggy at the top.I stopped into a shelter for lunch on the far side of Moosilauke, and found a SOBO hiker that I've been trying to find for a while. While hiking with Dirty Dan on the Long Trail, we introduced ourselves to a SOBO who remarked that they knew another person when the same name about two weeks behind them! Well, today I found sobo Dirty Dan and enjoyed telling him of my search while out of the rain in the shelter. I've had some awesome coincidences on the trail, and this was no exception considering there are many hikers headed in opposite directions who don't meet each other due to breaks and town days.The descent past the shelter was right next to a raging waterfall from all the rain. It was super technical and slow going, which wasn't what I needed considering I had already gotten a late start and had taken my time on Moosilauke and Christmas in July trail magic. I talked with another hiker named Chugs at a parking lot in Kinsman Notch. By the time I continued on it was nearly 6pm. I soon passed the 1800 mile marker, which was a creative one considering this one was crafted out of moose poop. The trail got more and more treacherous in the ongoing rain and the hiking got slower as nightfall came and my feet began to blister. By nighttime, the rain made sure the trail consisted of only three parts - slick rock slabs, streams following the trail down the mountains, and puddles of unknown depth, the deepest of which I found out was up to my knee. In all the last 6.5 miles into camp took 4 hours of trudging without seeing another soul. I kept the Christmas in July playlist going the whole time since I couldn't use my phone screen with my wet hands, so I about have that memorized by now. Time seemed to crawl by during the hike as it was just me and my thoughts.

We had to cross Eliza Brook, which was RAGING from all the rain yesterday evening and overnight. The SOBOs who made it to camp yesterday said it wasn't like this when they crossed it, and they wouldn't have tried to cross it in its current state. Some people even turned around to hike back out the way I came. I ended up bushwhacking 15 minutes upstream before shimmying across a fallen tree with the help of Pirate since the trail followed the brook on the other side, but another large nobo group ended up crossing on an improvised log bridge.I passed some cool alpine ponds today but the bog bridges were useless since the waterline was still above my boots while standing on them. Kinsman mountain was unremarkable with wet rocks and the same foggy view. I noticed my knees hurting a bit on the descent, which I've never had before. The miles crawled by, and my constant wet feet and some chafing were NOT helping. I stopped by my first AMC hut, Lonesome Lake, and grabbed a coffee cake for a snack since I was already late meeting up with Bear Bait to get my lunch.I ran into the same nobo group (consisting of Sameyes, Dirtbag Dave, Pegasus, Vermont, and Playboy) trying to cross the next raging brook, but even their logÂ  bridge building skills were no match for this torrent. After trying to get creative for a little while we ended up heading back to near Lonesome Lake and taking a side trail down to a state park campsite further down highway from where the AT crosses. I technically skipped about a mile and a half of trail so maybe I'll come back and do it at some point in the future if I have time to come up to the Whites. While waiting for Bear Bait to show up, Vermont's dad, who lives nearby, showed up with pizza and police shirts since he used to be the local police chief! That pizza really hit the spot.When Bear Bait showed up we headed to a hotel in town, which was awesome because it was definitely the biggest room I've stayed in so far. I spent the rest of the day figuring out how to get my body back into hiking shape and not let my feet deteriorate further.

Mileage is limited by the difficulty of the trail, ridgelines are hard to cross on stormy days, I wasn't sure about whether to reserve any AMC hut spots or try to do work for stay, I had to decide between stealth camping and staying at some paid campsites, etc.While hiking from a trailhead to rejoin the AT, Bear Bait and I ran into Sassafras and her friend Bramble and caught up with them.I made the steep climb most of the way up to Franconia Ridge in a rainshower before stopping to eat at a nice covered area in Liberty Springs campsite. I passed a couple on their first hiking trip on the way up - that must've been a crazy introduction to backpacking! The storm cleared out and some SOBOers came down who had to hide under rocks since they got stuck on the ridge in the thunderstorm. After talking with them and looking at the clouds, I decided to try to get across the ridge myself. It was somewhat clear at first but got very foggy once above treeline. It felt extremely solitary - it seemed that no one else wanted to try to make a run across the ridge and I only found two other people headed in the opposite direction. Additionally, the fog whisked away the views and even the sloping ground on either side of the ridge. Thunder rumbled once in the cloud I was in, so I got a bit scared and kicked it in to gear since I was in the middle of the exposed ridge. However, as I hiked along, I stopped to pick up a piece of trash, and suddenly I reached the edge of the clouds. The last half of the ridge was perfectly clear and sunny, and I finally got great views of the Whites! It was an incredible contrast. I could even see as far as the mountains that the Long Trail goes over way to the West in Vermont! The changes I made in the hotel room have definitely helped my body feel better hiking. The only problem is that I think something on the fabric of the new police shirt yesterday caused my skin to react, because sometimes my pack shifting positions would inflame my skin and send shocks of pain up my back.After descending from Franconia ridge, I stopped on top of Mt. Garfield to cook dinner and enjoy the sunset. A rainbow even appeared! I enjoyed watching the city lights and far away lightning as night fell.At my last restock I bought spray cheese as a bit of a fun snack item. Well, I realized that I shouldn't have trusted the lid in my backpack as it fell off at some point while getting squished around and unleashed cheese all over that outside pocket of my pack.

It felt like a trail reunion at the trail junction. We all stopped by an AMC hut pretty early into the day and managed to get some leftover breakfast for free. The huts are always ready to get rid of any extra food since they have to pack out anything leftover! While there, some runners stopped by to refill some water who are attempting an FKT of the Pemi loop, a 50k Franconia Ridge and some other white mountains.I spent the rest of the afternoon leapfrogging Wheat, Chili, and some other hikers.

We even got a chance to dry our tents out in the rain so that all of our gear is dry again! Checking the weather, I began to think about stealth camping at a secret location I've heard of on top of Mt. Washington. The plan has been stewing in my mind since I heard about it near the start of my trip. The weather on Mt. Washington is considered some of the worst in the world, so the fact that it is going to be clear seems like a rare opportunity.The vortex is definitely real. I spent over an hour on my breaks at both of the huts today! Thankfully the miles after Zealand Falls were pretty flat and I could actually walk a normal pace. We walked through a valley with beautiful views up rockwalls on either sides. I headed down a short side trail to check out Thoreau falls, which flowed over very flat boulders. I noticed while hiking that something I ate at the hut was NOT agreeing with my stomach and I began to feel awful and slow down. Thankfully I ran into Chili, who was also not feeling good, and we were able to help each other through the last 3 miles together. I was going to push further, but realized that I've been hiking late the past few days to try to catch up and just need to break the cycle by getting some sleep, so I stealth camped just before Route 302 with some other hikers. We checked out the road since we heard there was trail magic there. We didn't find any, but we did help Chili get a hitch to meet up with Stripper since we were already out and about.","Stealth spot at Gale River trail junction (mile 1830.1)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599095,"I slept great last night and felt super energized in the morning. It also didn't rain so everything stayed dry! Pretty quickly into the day we crossed the road again, and found trail magic from Stitches! She was incredibly nice to talk to, and we loaded up on some awesome food before the tough climb today. I took off afterwards to make up the miles I didn't complete yesterday to catch up on sleep. It was a very steep climb up Webster Cliffs, but the rocks are dry and I finally got some good sleep so I was cruising compared to earlier parts of the Whites. The Webster Cliffs came with some fantastic views into the valley. On Webster mountain I could see the steep ridge that I came up, which felt satisfying, and from Jackson I got a fantastic view of Washington! All day the summit was in on and off clouds so I kept hoping and hoping for a clear night. I passed soooo many dayhikers today, the most people I've talked to on trail in a long time - the trail is crawling with people now that the rain has passed. In fact, the last two days have been full of trail reunions cause I caught up to a bunch of other hikers or even passed them when I kept hiking through the rain at the start of the Whites.At Mizpah Springs hut I got some more soup since it's cheap but good. I took all the side loops to the presidential loops today, cause when next will I be out here? At the top of Eisenhower, I met a rockhound who showed some awesome rocks he found near the peak. The clouds cleared up in the afternoon! I also headed above treeline whether I'll be exposed for the next 12 miles. I got phone service one last time and checked the weather on top of Mt. Washington, and it looked clear.Throughout the day I've been leapfrogging Mark, who was a 2016 thruhiker and is back to do the whites again, and talked for a while with him at Lake of the Clouds hut where a bunch of my friends are staying tonight. Some people thought my plan to stealth on top of Washington was crazy but cheered me on as I left regardless. I hauled the mile and a half up Washington because I was just so excited. I headed into the clouds for the last bit and found Bear Bait. We celebrated and took some pictures while the clouds cleared up just as I had hoped! I restocked from the car quick before the road down the mountain closed. Now alone and with all the tourists gone, I explored all the buildings on top of the summit and tried for cell service but didn't find anything.After all the daytime activity settled down on the summit, I set up my tent in the hidden spot on the summit. I'm wearing every piece of clothing I have tonight to make sure that I don't have any late night emergencies. The clouds coming up Washington thinned out again enough to watch a bit of the sunset. I met Eileen and Meredith, two volunteers who cook for the crew in the weather station, and talked with them for a bit about the trail. They were incredibly nice and promised to pray for my safety during the rest of my trip. After cooking dinner I even stepped outside briefly to check out the stars, joined by Jupiter and Saturn.I think that often times we hear stories from parents and grandparents about things that aren't possible to do any longer. I feel the same way about my tent spot for the night - there's no way this will still be a possibility when I tell kids or grandkids about it!I'm camping 5000 feet higher tonight than I did last night. I'm a bit scared camping up here but a lot excited at how amazing of an opportunity this is.","Maine Central Railroad (mile 1845.1)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599096,"Last night I had a visitor at around midnight - a squirrel! Animal problems were the last thing I expected to encounter considering where I stealthed. Thankfully I was able to fling it out the tent door without too much sleep lost. The combination of the windblock, my tent, and wearing every piece of clothing that I have worked quite well and I was actually able to get some sleep. Not a ton, but still, more than expected.The sound of footsteps and voices above me woke me up in a panic, but thankfully it was only other hikers who had hiked up early to watch the sunrise. I quickly packed up my tent and joined them. The clouds had stayed away overnight and we got to watch the entirety of the Whites come alive with color. I decided to take my time today since I only had 9 miles or so (including a bit of extra distance on the side trails to hit all the peaks) and spend plenty of time on Washington visiting the gift shop, sending post cards, charging devices, making crank pennies, finally catching up on some journaling (which I have been terrible about the past two weeks!), and taking in the summit and the views I have been looking forward to for so long. I decided I can keep up with posting text entries for my journal while on the trail and that I'll catch up on pictures after I finish. After taking one last minute at the observation deck, I headed down the trail and crossed the cog railway tracks. I continued to hear the train whistles echo through the mountains the rest of the day.. Next for the presidentials came Clay, the rocky Jefferson, and the long climb up Adams. I chose an incredibly steep trail down Adams since I wanted to check out a rock outcropping known as Moon Rocks and an alpine lake on the way to the Madison Springs hut. There I ran into Clipper, who was doing work for stay along with Animal. I realized that I hadn't seen him in 25 days!My break at Madison Springs felt great but after relaxing so much this morning I pushed hard up Madison, the last Presidential mountain. The downhill from it and over the next 2.5 miles was slow going regardless of how much I wanted to get to camp. As I headed back below treeline, I realized that I've been above it for over a day. My legs definitely got burned from all the sun, which almost never happens to me because I've got so much leg hair. After getting into camp I got right into the regular schedule of setting up and spoke with Mark (who's staying at the same campsite, which is pretty packed tonight).I really enjoyed the presidentials and the unique characteristics of each peak.","Mt.

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599097,"Well, I overslept a bit today. The alarm was set for 6:30, but when I noticed how sunny it was outside the tent my phone said 8am! I wanted to do work for stay tonight at the Carter Notch Hut, and the ideal time to get to a hut for work for stay is 4pm, so that set my goals for pace today.Thankfully, yesterday evening brought me down enough elevation that the first few miles to Pinkham Notch were relatively flat and quick. While walking along I heard some crackling in the woods that I thought was somebody further ahead the trail tripping, but soon realized that it was instead coming from a large black animal in the woods nearby - a moose! Two moose, in fact, a momma and her calf that I got to watch meander through the woods for a few minutes. It was fun to watch the gangly calf crash through the woods to catch up to momma when she got ahead. About a mile later I passed by the Mount Washington auto road. A guided tour van stopped by the crossing to talk about the AT so I waved. I made good time the rest of the way to the Pinkham Notch visitor center and arrived just before noon. The sandwiches looked good enough that I got one even though it means I have to carry my lunch as extra weight until the next restock. I took the opportunity to use the wifi to finally catch up on posting some backlogged journaling! Though soon I had stayed too long as the vortex of the real world tried to pull me in with emails about college and phone calls for reservations and the rest of my trip. I left the visitor's center determined to get a work for stay spot. I had heard while chatting with Mark (the 2016 thru) that Wildcat Mountain was a tough climb, and he was right -Â  the 2000 foot gain in 2 miles to the wildcat ski gondola (which was actually running today) definitely slowed me down, but at least came with fantastic views across the notch to the Presidentials. The downhill was just as steep (1100 feet in 0.9 miles) but went much quicker. I arrived a little later than I wanted, at 4:30, but it worked out fine as there were still spots available due to Carter Notch hut being one of the most underused, even though I think the deep notch between wildcat and Carter dome is beautiful, especially as the sun sets on the cliffs. Mark, another section hiker, and Mule, the other work for stay tonight, all got to enjoy some leftover cheese and bread from the naturalist! We all helped answer questions in a presentation the naturalist gave about hiking the Appalachian Trail before having an amazing dinner and dessert. Our work for stay afterwards included cleaning dishes and setting mousetraps with peanut butter and raisins around the hut. Before heading to bed I soaked my feet in the nearby mountain ponds and also used the clear night as a chance to use the hut telescope to look at the stars. I've always imagined a backpacking trip where I manage to bring a telescope along to the wild sites I stay with beautifully dark skies, so this was a dream come true. As I fall asleep I occasionally hear the sound of a mousetrap leaping to life with the death of another victim.","Osgood tentsite (mile 1866.7)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599099,"I woke up to a beautiful morning and was able to pack up quickly with no tent needing put away and with all the space in the hut. The climb up Carter Dome was steep but came with great views back to the Presidentials and towards the end of the Whites once passing over the peak.Â  On one of the three Carter Mountains I found a large brown bunny that didn't seem too afraid of me as I was about to get within a yard of it before it hopped along to somewhere else to munch on more blueberries.For lunch I stopped by Imp shelter, which is the first shelter I've checked out in a while - though the AMC huts are cool, I was definitely missing the feel of shelters. I hope I get to stay in one last one before the end of my trip.In the afternoon I made the quick trip up Mt. Moriah, the last of the Whites! So much has happened since I first entered them. Near the top I found a worker painting blazes on the trail and talked with him for a bit. While walking down I began to realize how close to being done my trip really is. The descent was a little steep at first but had some helpful rock stairs. It flattened out and the last 3.5 miles into town were so smooth that my hiker legs were confused by the unfamiliar terrain.After reaching the trailhead on Route 2, I got picked up by Bear Bait for my last restock of the trip! For dinner we went to Dynasty buffet, which Mantra Dynasty recommended to Andrew and I a while ago. My hiker hunger definitely got my money's worth - I ate a little bit of everything they offer, and still had two servings of ice cream afterwards!Tonight I'm staying at the Rattle River hostel, which has a reputation on the trail for being far and above the cleanest hostel. It was great to hang out at one more hostel before the end of my trip, as they're always a great place to catch up with the hikers you do know and meet some that you don't. I'm real tired and am going to get a good night's rest tonight so I can have a fun last day and a half on the trail.At some point today I realized that it's August. That's crazy! I can't believe this summer is going to end soon.","Carter Notch Hut (mile 1877.4)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599307,"Today marks my last full day on the trail. As much as I'm excited for the future I have before me, I can't help but feel as though a part of me will miss the trail life until I return.This morning I made myself a pancake breakfast, which always reminds me of Saturday mornings on scout trips. After packing up, i spent a long time catching up on journaling in between socializing with awesome hikers and staff at the hostel. It feels great that I managed to get up to date before my journey is complete. It definitely delayed my start though - people who are staying tonight started showing up because I didn't leave until 1pm! After saying goodbye to some friends who are zeroing at the hostel, I headed North on North Street, and passed the dam over the Androscoggin River. I found a bit of trail magic along a road before the AT heads into the woods again. Shortly into the climb I ate lunch, which I really just wanted to do anywhere out of the hostel so that I got moving, but I found a nice rock with a pretty good view of the river valley. While on my way to the next viewpoint, I had my phone out checking to see exactly where I crossed the 600 mile mark when a bee stung my arm! I swatted it off but it left its butt and stinger in my arm. I hiked to the 600 mile mark and celebrated by using tweezers to remove the stinger. During all of this I met Giant, a 6'10"" hiker. He's trying to do the trail in a summer between college years so he's been hiking quite fast. We cruised up Mt. Hayes together, but I decided to take the spur trail at the top to reach the actual peak since I have time to smell the roses today and tomorrow. It was cool to reach the top of the first mountain of the Mahoosuc range, plus I got some wild blueberries as a reward. Much as my plans so long ago for this trip have blossomed into a journey, the blueberries that were so small near my starting point have developed and grown to be full.After starting so late, I really kicked it into gear the rest of the day. We had some great views of the surrounding mountains at several points today. I leapfrogged Tunes, AM Fog, and Flomo in the afternoon, who I haven't seen in a long time. I think AM Fog is the earliest person that I saw more than once on the trail, so it was cool that I got to see him so close to the end as well. We passed Dream Lake and I splashed myself with a bit of water from the inlet so we'll see how my dreams are affected tonight. I reached Gentian Pond shelter at around 7:30 and made dinner. The plan was originally to make dinner and swim then head to the next shelter in order to cross the border, but I found some friends here and enjoyed talking with them, plus the reviews for the next shelter are pretty poor, so I just decided to stay the night here. Besides, then I can get a picture of the Maine border during the day! Though I didn't go swimming, I did soak my feet one more time with a beautiful view at the lake. I was in a great mood pretty much all afternoon and evening (which definitely helped my pace), and I'm excited to be in a great mood tomorrow too.","Rattle River Hostel (mile 1892.7)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599308,"The view from the shelter this morning as the sun rose was beautiful, so I definitely made a good choice to stay there. Though today has been the planned stop date for a while, I couldn't help but notice that it felt surreal telling people that today was my last day. I still packed up like usual, filtered water like usual, and started hiking like usual.The trail is definitely a place where you never stop learning tips and tricks. Before leaving the shelter, an older SOBO couple tought me how to tie an Italian knot, which is quicker than a double knot but less likely to come undone.Soon after leaving the shelter I caught up to Bird, a 2013 thruhiker I've gotten to know over the past few days, and the crew from the brook crossing day (Sameyes, Vermont, Dirtbag Dave, Playboy, and Pegasus), who I leapfrogged the rest of the day. After a bit of climbing we reached the last peak of my section, which is awesomely called Mount Success. The views from the glacier-smoothed open rock near the top were fantastic to take in, from the Whites behind us to the rest of the Mahoosucs in Maine ahead of us. I tried to find a supposed side trail to a plane crash and couldn't find it, but at least got to bring up the story about peeing off the wing of a bomber at 10,000 feet at Philmont because of it (which is technically completely true). During the descent we were all excited for the Maine border. Upon reaching it we all dropped packs and celebrated in our own way. I took my time there, as I had waited 614.4 miles to get to that sign! For me the celebration included returning a piece of Maine Birch bark from Mr. Fanelli's Appalachian Trail hike that I've been carrying with me, in addition to writing my own message on another piece of Birch bark. It felt fantastic to finally reach what has seemed like such a far away goal, and the rest of the NOBO thruhikers were pumped to be in their last state. I wished them luck with the rest of their journey as they headed out and they wished me luck in college.After finally getting all the pictures I wanted and letting out another celebratory yell, I hiked the last 0.5 miles of the trail and laid my Birch bark marker at the base of a Maine birch tree - returned as promised, which felt amazingly rewarding and cathartic. While doing so Bear Bait showed up at the side trail junction. We took more pictures and left a surprise to help out hikers at the Carlo Col shelter before heading down Carlo Col trail to the car. I got my reward ice cream for finishing there, and we drove out on the very rocky ATV access roads. A stop at Burger King was my first meal back before heading to the hotel. I enjoyed the scenery on the drive - many people rave about the scenery and lakes in Maine along the trail.Once back at the hotel room, I took the opportunity to clean up and decompress a little bit. We headed out to grab breakfast for the next morning and were planning to eat dinner at a popular local restaurant, but it was too long of a wait so we ate near our hotel at a sports bar with a live band. It seems like everything is booked up this weekend because there's a big ATV festival nearby that a lot of out of towners are visiting. After returning, I sorted my gear for the flight back home and caught up on news that I've missed. It's a strange thought that the backpack which has essentially carried my life for the past two months will no longer be needed again for a while.I don't feel super tired yet even though I hiked fast and did lots during my last few days on the trail, but that's normal during the end of a trip for me - I feel like Superman knowing that I'll soon have a place to completely rest up regardless of how much I push myself through.","Gentian Pond shelter (mile 1904.4)

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599923,"This morning we woke up at 3:30 and quickly got ready for our flight, which is even one of the later ones available for our route! I was able to stuff all my gear and my boots into my backpack, which I double wrapped in extra large garbage bags before checking in the hopes of not losing any straps. While waiting to board i spoke with a forestry service manager who has biked across large portions of the U.S. Our flight was overbooked by three people but that issue disappeared when United offered $3000 vouchers for anyone willing to take the next flight.I've always really enjoyed flying and still haven't lost the wonder I get from looking out the window as the plane soars through the different layers of clouds. I got to know Jason, a 19 year old who sat next to me and also spent a bit of time in the Whites. I liked being able to see Lakes Ontario, Erie, and Michigan as we passed overhead.Our layover in Chicago went well, and soon enough we were on a small but quick (less than an hour of actual flight time!) flight to Dayton. Amazingly enough, both of the seats next to Bear Bait and I were empty so we had a bit of extra room. There were no mountains to see this time but I did enjoy using the GPS in my phone to identify different highways we flew over.We had a warm welcome from Wilbur and Mom at the airport, who I was glad to see.

"Orville and Wilbur, The Wright Brothers",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599941,"The past few days have been full of adjustments back to normal life. Cleaning gear and shaving off 54 days of scruff has been replaced with buying textbooks and texting my roommate. Scabs on my shins are the last vestiges of evidence on my body that I even went on a trip this summer. Though my hiking is finished until the next journey, I wanted to write up a conclusion post to tie up some loose ends and do some reflecting.
At the beginning, I listed a few reasons for choosing the Appalachian Trail and Delaware Water Gap as my starting location. I'm extremely happy with how these choices turned out. I loved the culture of the Appalachian Trail and loved being a part of the experience with so many other amazing hikers that I met. Starting right after Pennsylvania turned out to be a great way to adjust to the trail, and I still got to experience many of the arguably most difficult and most beautiful sections of the trail, and reached my goal of Maine. In the future I'm looking forward to summiting Katahdin one day when the time is right. Looking back, I legitimately wouldn't change anything about my itinerary for fear of missing out on many of the amazing events that I now have stories of.
Gear - I definitely had time to refine my kit during the hundreds of miles of use. Some notable comments:

Boots - I am beyond done with these. They served me well, and worked perfectly for the first few hundred miles, particularly over rocky sections. But as I gained trail legs and the ability to hike faster, I realized just how much they weighed down my feet. Additionally, slogging through the rain-soaked trails in the Whites where it was simply impossible to keep water from going above the ankle line made me realize that my current clothing/foot system was a recipe for chafing and blisters and that I would much rather have quickdrying, non-waterproof trailrunners (as well as body glide in addition to just gold bond).
I really only need one set of hiking clothes, one set of sleeping clothes, and layering options for a long journey. I was able to stay warm on top of Mount Washington with what I have, so I definitely don't need to bring anything more on 3-season trips.
When you can find it, denatured alcohol is a more efficient fuel to burn than Heet, which serves as a more available backup.
The loft system I developed for my stove worked great, and meant that I didn't have to worry about the pot spilling my dinner as much or setting any picnic tables or shelters on fire.
My Nemo tent has issues in the rain. Any nights it rained with considerable strength, I woke up with puddles in (yes, inside!) the downhill end of my tent. Not sure if I should have applied extra DWR treatment before I left, but the portion of the tent with a high bathtub floor that serves as singlewall in order to save weight really doesn't work in my opinion. That being said, Nemo customer service is fantastic. They were able to send me an extra tent stake bag, which I lost early on in the trip, and an extra pole bag after the trip as I ripped mine up while scooting down rock slabs with the poles lashed to the bottom of my pack.
I loved the Osprey Exos pack, and saw many others on the trail using it as well. I like having a LOT of stuff easily accessible so I can do a lot without having to stop walking, so having both shoulder strap and hipbelt pockets was fantastic. I ended up sending home the ""brain"" portion to save weight and missed it less than I thought I would.
We thankfully didn't have any tick issues on the trip, so I think the permethrin clothing treatment worked.
I ended up sending the guidebook home and just using Guthook's on my phone. A bit of a risk considering technology is infinitely more finicky than paper, but I trusted myself to keep the phone dry and protected and it worked out. My phone also performed marvelously for pictures and journaling (especially once I installed an app to bulk-upload photos for trailjournals, Aurigma Up). I used Google Camera for particularly beautiful (or high dynamic range) scenes that warranted the extra time and storage space, and the default camera for everything else.
Restocking via trips to town worked great and I liked not having to worry about picking up packages from a post office. I didn't have to hitch at all, but wished that I had at least once since it seems to be a dying part of ""old America"".
By the end of the trip I was choosing more calorie-dense food options so as not to lose weight. I tried to eat a jar of peanut butter between each restock. Two tips I discovered: peanut butter with honey flavoring is much easier to eat in large amounts, and fruit snacks are a great source of quick energy on a tough climb, and they even include a full day's dose of Vitamin C!
On future trips I think I'll try to find (or package) smaller-size bottles of all my consumables to save weight and reduce waste.
I ended up sending home the water purification pills - it wasn't worth the logistic trouble of having to wait 30 minutes just for the extra protection against viruses (as the filter takes care of almost everything else). My Katadyn Befree had issues, including that a hole developed in the 1L bag, the rubber o-ring delaminated, and the filter speed slowed down dramatically afterwards from its usually amazing pace. I borrowed another Befree from the Camerons for the last two weeks of the trip, and this one worked much faster and without issue. I'm still awaiting a response from Katadyn to see what they think about the o-ring issue. I might try a Sawyer Squeeze to see how it compares.

I learned a lot about life and myself. Some trail wisdom I wish to share:

Goodbyes almost never go as planned (especially on the trail, where you don't know if you'll see someone again in 5 minutes during a break or if you'll never see them again). If you want to tell someone something before they leave, just tell them! Don't wait for a chance, make one!
The universe works in mysterious ways that we'll probably never fully know, and coincidences are a wonderful thing.
The most important part of being successful on the trail in my opinion is to ""Know Thyself"", as advocated by Socrates. There is much to know about one's self: knowing how much lack of comfort you're able to put up with, knowing how far/fast you can push yourself, knowing when you need to get moving and when you need to relax, knowing how much you need to plan, knowing what kind of people you like to hang out with, knowing whether you want to meet people or be solitary, knowing whether you want to enjoy some luxuries or save money, knowing whether you can sleep in shelters or you need more privacy, knowing what bothers you and what makes you smile, knowing what motivates you to keep going when you're feeling down, and knowing what made you come to the trail in the first place and what you hope to gain from it. The trail is a great chance to experiment with different methods or philosophies of living.
Be radically ok with yourself as an individual. Don't always rely on other people to make decisions or provide the entertainment and fun. Be ok with splitting off to achieve things that are meaningful to you. It's your own life, be your own wonderful person!

And of course, this adventure would not have occurred without an incredible support crew. In no particular order, here's a list of people I wish to give my deepest thanks:

Wilbur, Bear Bait, Andrew ""Rice Busch/Ice Stick"", and Mr. ""Recliner"" Cameron, for taking time out of their schedules and being crazy enough to join me for some miles.
Bear Bait and my Mom, for the countless sacrifices they've made to support me on this trip and others.
My amazing girlfriend, for putting up with a crazy guy who spends almost his entire summer 500 miles away from everyone he knows and loves.
The trail family, including those hiking and those providing help along the trail, for the sacrifices they make to be a part of the amazing greater experience that is the trail.
Mr. Fanelli, for being a great source of wisdom and guidance in many adventures leading up to this, for being a source of advice for the Appalachian Trail, as well as providing an awesome memento to spur me on to Maine.
Various other scout leaders who have facilitated my love of the outdoors and adventure.
Countless unnamed others who have touched my life in order to make me the person I am today.

I left on this trip hoping to give myself some time to relax and think things out during this transition period in my life. I found what I was looking for and think that my time this summer was well spent, perhaps the best of any summer. I can't imagine someone having experiences like I did on trail and not coming off psyched for life.
One final quote to share (which I now realize I mis-attributed on my birch bark end marker):

""Donât Cry Because Itâs Over; Smile Because It Happened""
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
-adapted from a quote by Ludwig Jacobowski

While I embrace raw sensory experiences and think that to avoid emotion is to avoid what life has to offer, this quote reminds me that just because something is gone does not mean that we cannot still rejoice in the memories of it.
Well, I guess that's about it. Now that you've read about my adventures, go out and have your own.
