I had a moment like that two years ago when I realized, as much as I wanted to and as much as I had always dreamed of it, that I would never do a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. I don't even remember the first time I heard about the 2,189-mile trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine. All I know is that from the moment I learned about it I had a burning desire to thru hike it. I can't explain what it was about hiking the trail that stirred me so deeply and tugged so heavily on my heart. It just became something that I knew I had to do or else my life would never feel complete. But there I sat staring at myself in the mirror, realizing that it was never going to happen. It was a devastating realization.I was staring at a woman who at 50 was suffering from numerous health issues, arthritis, carpal tunnel, severe body aches and pains, incredible fatigue and weakness, terrible inflammation, and who was also more than 50 pounds overweight. I felt like a very old woman and I was filled with hopelessness. Flash forward to the fall of 2016 shortly after turning 52. I don't know how I discovered Dr. Jason Fung's book, The Obesity Code, but that was the beginning of a new beginning for me. That book introduced me to the Low Carb High Fat way of eating. It made a lot of sense to me and also sounded like a way of eating that I could actually stick with so I thought, why not? I decided to give it a try. In the four months that followed I lost 50 pounds and watched in amazement as my many health issues began to disappear. Arthritis pain gone. Carpal tunnel pain gone. Fatigue gone. Inflammation gone. Insomnia cured. Hot flashes gone. Energy level increasing. I felt like I was a butterfly breaking free of a cocoon (more like a mummification) of illness and old age. I was so surprised and overjoyed at the results of this way of eating that that was all I was thinking about. But then one day I was standing in front of the mirror after having just completed the longest walk I'd taken in twenty years and it hit me... I just might be able to hike the AT after all! The thought washed over me like a trickle at first then quickly became a torrent of hope. I thought about all the reasons why that dream had been so out of reach just a short while ago and realized that those reasons were all fading away. There is nothing like the feeling of losing all hope of achieving the biggest dream of your life and then later discovering you've been given another chance to pursue it!
Once I fully realized that ""yes, I can do this"" I became a woman obsessed! I began reading so many AT books and blogs, watching YouTube videos, researching gear, and buying my first pair of trail runners. I even found current thru hikers to follow on Instagram so I could cheer them on and be inspired in return.
My family, in varying degrees, has been very supportive. My oldest daughter is very supportive and happy for me but she also worries about my safety. My son, in true (former) Marine fashion has been extremely supportive and motivating by discouraging even the tiniest doubts or questioning whether I can do this or not and reminding me over and over ""you can do this, Mom!"" My youngest daughter is just plain supportive. She's not worried about how I'll do and she doesn't try to motivate me like a drill instructor. My husband is being as supportive as he can, bless his heart. The thought of my being away for 5 months or more weighs heavily on him and of course he worries more about my safety than anyone but he knows how much this means to me and he's determined to support me in this as best as he can one way or another. I know this isn't easy for him, which makes me appreciate his support all the more.
I've set a goal to be ready for the trail by March of 2018. I want to be in the best shape I can be so that I can finish it as quickly as I can. I've been a stay-at-home wife and mom since before my daughter was born 31 years ago so being away from my family for an extended period is not going to be at all easy... but it's also one of the reasons why I feel I have to do this. I've been living with and taking care of others forever and have never once in my life been independent or on my own and I just really, really need this. I need to know what I'm made of. I need to get up everyday and walk towards a seemingly impossible goal, in a world very much outside my comfort zone where I am forced to grow, to face my fears and overcome them, to suffer everything from pain, exhaustion, cold, heat, and hunger to incredible loneliness and yet not give up. I want to reach the top of Katahdin and know for perhaps the first time in my life, that I CAN do whatever I set my heart and mind to do and that nothing will ever hold me back again.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Sun",0
Fly Away,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557928,"In August 2014, my family surprised me with a trip to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee for my 50th birthday. They picked out a beautiful mountain cabin where we would all stay and enjoy some wonderful time together. We had a blast at DollyWood and visiting Gatlinburg. But the most memorable part of the trip for me was the visit to Clingmans Dome. I was quite overweight at the time and the walk up to the lookout tower was very difficult. I had to stop often for a breather but I was determined to make it up there. Partway up the paved path leading to the lookout I noticed a small sign to my left that said Appalachian Trail. I gasped. It was like turning around and suddenly seeing your favorite movie star or something. This was the trail that I had been dreaming of hiking for I don't know how long. The trail I'd read numerous books about and watched so many documentaries about. And there it was in front of me, a narrow gravel covered path disappearing into the dense woods. I walked over to it slowly and touched the sign. My husband snapped a picture of me with the sign. I smiled as he took the picture but could feel the tears sneaking up on me as I stood there looking at that tiny bit of a very big dream that would never come true. I took a few timid steps down the trail and felt like I was walking on sacred ground, and like I didn't deserve to be there. The thought that I could actually be able to someday hike the AT felt so utterly impossible in that moment and I could feel my heart breaking. I couldn't hold back the tears. The view from the top of the lookout was salt in the wounds. I thought of all the breathtaking vistas I would never climb to and sighed. Happy birthday to me...
But that was then and this is now. Thanks to finally being able to lose the weight and regain my health I've been able to not only dust off my dream but can now pursue it with my whole heart. I'm going to spend the next year doing everything I can to prepare for this journey. I'm going to read the books, follow the blogs, research the gear, practice those hikes, and pray, pray, pray.",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Mon",0

Currently, I'm in California but have spent the past week sick and very sedentary. I'm better now and knew this morning that it was time to get myself outside and walking again. I've got one year to get myself ready for my thru hike and I don't want to waste any of it. I still need to drop probably a good 15 to 20 pounds and I have a lot of strengthening and toning up to do. 
There is a beautiful reservoir here and I decided this morning to walk to it and hike around it. I walked first to Walgreens to get a water bottle to take with me and then I headed to the reservoir a mile away. The hike around the reservoir is only moderately difficult. It is 2.7 miles around the reservoir and I circled it twice before heading back to the apartment. I walked a total of 8.5 miles in a little under three hours. I'll be glad when my trekking poles get here because I could have definitely used them on some of those hills today. My goal is to eventually be able to make four laps around the reservoir easily and then I will start hiking with a weighted pack, starting out with perhaps five or ten pounds and gradually increasing until I get to my full pack weight of 26 pounds. There are some much more difficult trails nearby but I don't want to get ahead of myself. Once I can go four laps around the reservoir with a full pack I'll set my sights on the more difficult trails. For now I feel like I'm making pretty good progress and I'm just gonna stick with it. 
I've had my lunch and now I think I'm gonna take a nap. I'm beat!",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Tue",0

I'm still working on getting more weight off of me and getting in better shape.  I've lost 50 lbs and have another 15-20 to go.  I really, really wanted to buy a Nordic Track Incline Treadmill but holy cow they are expensive and that price tag would pay for most of my gear! So I'm still just hitting the pavement or the trails instead. I did just join a ""local"" gym (I'm 25 minutes from town so ""local"" doesn't mean close-by). They were having a 3-day special: 3 months for $40.  It's the same gym my son and several friends belong to and they love it, plus it's open 24/7 so I thought, why not?  They do have an incline treadmill so that's nice.  I'll try to go three times a week and go for long walks on the other days.  I found a 7+ mile hiking trail in Elizabethtown (an hour away) that goes around a lake that I want to do on weekends when the weather is good.  I will take a pack with food and water and hike around once before noon, stop for lunch, then hike it again before I go home.  That would be a near 15-mile day with a pack.  I really do need to kick myself into shape fast because I've decided to start part of the hike this fall!
I've decided to hike Springer through the Smokies this fall then pick up where I left off sometime in March.  I'm going to start this shortly after my grandson, Jericho's birthday in mid-September and be back in time for my grandson, Reilly's birthday in mid-October.  I'm doing this for a few reasons... 1) to avoid the huge hiker bubble that puts so much stress on the trail 2) fall is the most beautiful season to hike the Smokies 3) it will make the rest of my hike feel much shorter and get me home quicker with that kind of head start.  I don't know that I've heard of anyone else doing this but surely others have.  That fall hike will also give me a great opportunity to really test out my gear, and myself, before spending months hiking to Katahdin.
In other news... so I got back on Facebook recently, too (sigh).  I left FB during the election because it just got to be too unpleasant, ugly and depressing and I swore I'd never go back.  But I've found myself meeting hikers on Instagram and YouTube and we needed a better way to connect and communicate so I relented and went back to FB.  I'm following tons of hiking groups and hikers there now and it's been great.  I've already learned so many new things and gotten so much inspiration there.  I also decided to create a blog (ketotokatahdin.com) and a FB page for that, too, so friends and family could follow my progress. I only got it launched yesterday so it's still just an infant blog with a lot of learning and growing to do. I've only got one post so far and it's the same one as my first post here.
One of the thru-hiker books I read said that if you want to hike the AT and you're serious about it then you need to tell as many people as you can. Well, I've been doing that like crazy and now I find myself often thinking ""what the bloody heck have you done???"" hahaha....  I lay awake at night sometimes so stinking scared and shocked at myself for putting myself out there like that. But I know me, and I know that if I don't put myself out there I'll find a way to quietly back away and off of this path.
And I can't do that.",,View Entry,"May 06, Sat",0
