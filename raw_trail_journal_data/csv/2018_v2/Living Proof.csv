  My son Andrew was kind enough to let his mother sleep in on her 19th wedding anniversary and made the 70 minute drive with me to the trailhead.  I was able to start hiking by 8am.  The first couple hours were flat and cool and I was feeling great.  However with temps in the mid to high 80’s and throw in some elevation, I was soon suffering.  I played tug of war with heat exhaustion from 11-6.  Needing extended breaks to lower by body temp and slow my breathing.  I walked in the morning with a section biker named sister from New Jersey.  She decided to slow down though, then I met a man from Japan who was visiting to do a 100 mile section hike.  He seemed to hurting worse than me.  At ct341, I met energizer bunny, a Scotsman that did 1400 miles last year and was looking to finish this year.  Unfortunately the heat was really effecting him and he needed to get into Kent for some r&r.  I stayed with him until he hitched a ride.  From 341 to the St. John ledges was a death march.  I saw several younger thru hikers, only caught one’s name, landfill.  I had intended to push a bit further but there is very steep boulder descent after the ledges and I was too spent, so it will be saved for the morning.  Hope it’s a bit cooler tomorrow

  I was up early as the songbirds woke me at 4:30ish am.  On the trail by 5:15 and an immediate steep descent from the Ledges, but I managed just fine and enjoyed a nice flat section along the Housatonic river, which made for some nice easy miles.  A trail first for me was using bug spray as I was swarmed with mosquitoes along the river, turns a little deet can be a lifesaver.  After still feeling the effects of heat exhaustion the day before, I hiked down rt 4 to a gas station to consume two large powerades in the shade for an hour.  The rest of the day went well, I hiked with stillbill off and on for a bit, who just returned to the trail after ending a thruhike attempt in ct last summer.  It seems I’m stuck at a 15 mile a day limit atm, until I build my endurance.  I’m very happy to be at 15 a day though given my current fitness level.  My biggest issue  atm is some fairly severe chafing in my groin region, I’ll leave it at that.

   I’ve decided my chafing issue requires a couple days off, not to mention my calves and quads are beyond sore.  I coordinated a pick up in Salisbury for a couple days at home to heal up.  On trail by 5:15 again I only had one decent ascent, which I managed surprisely well, although the cooler temps should get the assist there.  I hiked a good bit with an older flip flopper named do right from Virginia.  It does make the time go by to some conversation on occasion, giventhat I hike mostly alone.  It’s especially helpful when physically struggling.  I hiked into Salisbury with do right and proceeded to eat a bunch of town food.

  Wow, long day!  My wife, Kathleen drove me out Salisbury this morning and I was hiking by 7:30am.  The weather was perfect!! I may be a very long time before a get a day like today weather wise.  It was 52 when I started hiking and stayed very cool well into the afternoon.  I hiked up bear mountain with undertow, a flipflopper.  After bear came mount race and them mt Mitchell, and then ended the going up my bushnell.  The last mountain want in my original plans but I reached my destination for the day at 3:45 due to the cool weather.  I promised Kathleen not to overdo it, but that just wouldn’t be me!  I pushed on, but soon I was have trouble finding water and a place to camp.  Finding both these things was a must, so the miles just kept adding up.  Finally I managed to find something more than a mud puddle and I’m camped as discreetly as one can be in the corner of a open field.  Mosquitoes were really bad last hour of hike and setting up camp.  Bug spray is effective, but think i missed my head, and they got my a good 15-20 times through my hat.  Also like to mention a section hiker named blackberry, who has section hiked everything south of where I met her.   This is her 8th section hike!  Very tired, time some tunes then bed.

  I slept late today after pushing it a bit far yesterday and because it was quite chilly!  I had to put on additional clothing at 2:30am.  It was cool and overcast till 11am, which was nice. My left shin was tight today, so I consciously hiked slowly, trying not to further aggravate it.  It appears I’m in the midst of a mini bubble of late feb. hikers from Georgia.  My campsite is totally full and it’s only 6:30.  Highlight of the day was seeing my first wild porcupine, little guy only feet from me right off the trail in some brush.  Anyway, very tired and sore, but tomorrow looks super flat, so that should be nice.

  I tried not to wake all my campsite mates, but it’s really hard being quiet in the woods!  I was hiking by roughly 5:30 and made 10 miles and goose pond cabin by 10:30 am.  Unfortunately, I hiked a bit too fast and upset my feet a bit.  Stopping at goose pond cabin for lunch was a mistake. .5 mile side trail, strike one.  Taking water from a cooler with bleached water and taking a big swig, strike two.  I would have been better off just lunching on the I-90 overpass, oh well.  On the upside, I did a big black bear right on the trail.  After seeing hundreds of chipmunks a day seeing a wild animal the size of adult male black bear is still a bit startling.  The afternoon looked flat, and it was but very rocky and rooty, which made for less than ideal hiking. I stopped at October shelter, just totally exhausted.  These past days of 18-20 miles are a bit much and my body is trying to get me to slow down .  It’s still super early in day, but literally can’t go on.  Sleep by 6 pm tonight.

   Today was a town day!  I was hiking by 5:30am, but promised myself to hike slowly as my body is sending me signals that I need to slow my pace and daily mileage.  It was 11 miles to dalton ma. I made it their by 11 am, as the terrain was mostly flat and forgiving.  Once reaching town I made for breakfast at a restaurant on Main Street.  Two eggs, hash, home fries, bacon, Texas toast and three ice waters! I proceeded to the public library to charge my phone, call home and put my trailjournal entries in.  After that i hit Angelina’s subs and had a foot long pastrami sub.  Left town about three and got to campsite about 5.  This site is fairly elavated so I’ll be falling asleep to the sound of breeze blowing through the treetops.

  I had a short day today as I decided to get a shower and spend the night at Bascom lodge on Mt Greylock.  Greylock was a nice little tester mountain as I’ll be entering the Green mountains of Vermont tomorrow.  Managed a resupply in Cheshire this morning, so plan is to hike straight through to Friday when I’ll be getting off the trail for some days for my son’s high school graduation and grad party.  In the meantime, my bunk room is directly above some theater mashup taking place here at  the lodge. It sounds like a herd of grandmothers laughing...

  The birds failed to pry me from my warm bunk at the Bascom lodge at my usual time.    Thus, an usually late 7am start to a planned 20 mile day.  Coming down Massachusetts highest peak was very slow going for some reason, but I did meet some trail maintainers and thank them for their very hard work.  I made terrible time all the way down, crossed N Adams and began my ascent to Vermont.  This second half of the day I felt really strong.  I was able handle long sustained climbs and just overall endurance was great today.  Nice to see all suffering has paid some dividends.  The AT joins the Long Trail as you enter Vermont, so I’m meeting some LT newbies on their first day or two of hiking.  They have some nice energy compared to the haggard thru hikers from Georgia.  Planning another 20 miler tomorrow.

  Last night got quite cold as I think temps dipped into the high 30’s.  Despite this fact I put on still sweating hiking clothes and hit the trail by 5:30.  I hustled to Rt 9 by 7:15 and by 8:40 I had hitched a ride in and outta town and had nice big breakfast!  The rest of the day was fairly unremarkable except for the amazing cool breeze all day.  It made the hiking much more enjoyable.  I took a nice hour break at Goddard shelter, which was a cool shelter.  The lookout tower on Glastenbury Mt. was actually quite terrifying.  As I mentioned the wind was really gusting and heights really isn’t my thing.  Amazing views, but snapped my pics and quickly came back down.  Kid Gore is not an amazing shelter, but it has an amazing view right from inside the shelter, a rarity.  Right knee was bothering me a bit on descents today, hopefully a night’s rest will remedy that.  Thunderstorms tomorrow, planning. 15 miles to Stratton pond shelter which I’ve heard good things about.

   I was up early as thunderstorms Were in the forecast and hiking by 5:20am.  My right knee was still sore from the night before and with .25 miles it was hurting really bad.  I dragged my lame leg along for a bit over an hour, contemplating what my options were.  I finally took a 10 minute break on a rock and when I stood up my knee felt fine. Strangest thing,  but I happily welcomed pain free hiking.  One big climb today was Stratton mt. and I was welcomed by a horde of gnats at the summit.      Made great time after my knee recovered and managed to get my 15 miles down by 1 pm.  Luckily there are some nice folks here to kill the time with.  High light of the day was I saw my first baby bear.  Heard him first, but by clicking my poles managed to have him scurry up a tree and into view.  Didn’t see the mama, so didn’t wanna stay for a photo op and surprise her.

   Last night we ended up having quite a wind storm as it blew all night long with gusts up to 40mph.  I was thankful to have slept in the shelter fully protected from it.  Another early morning as I was hiking by 5:30am.  I hustled over forgiving terrain for 10 miles and made it a road crossing by 10:15.  Hitchhiked into Manchester center, where I had breakfast at Bob’s diner and picked up a couple things in town.  I was back to the trailhead by 11:40 and proceeded to hike Bromley mt. and then Peru mt.  It was another very cool and windy day.  Just enough rain to get the trail wet.  I was quite chilled by the end of the day and expect another cold night tonight.  I have just an easy 7 miles tomorrow morning and will be meeting my dad in Dansby for a trip home for my son Colin’s high school graduation and grad party.

I walked about 2 miles down and a car ended up coming by.  I basically made them stop and drive me to town as I despise road walking.  Home now, let this little hiker knee heal up.Living Proof","Peru peak shelter
