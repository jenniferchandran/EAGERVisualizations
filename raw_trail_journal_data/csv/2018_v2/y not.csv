On April 16, I'll embark on the five-month hike on the Appalachian Trail—2,190 miles from Springer Mountain, Georgia to Mount Katahdin, Maine. 
My initial plan was to hike alone. Then I remembered that my friend Dan and I had once discussed hiking the Appalachian Trail a few years ago. I texted him last fall asking if he still wanted to do the AT. Apparently, earlier that same day, he and his brother had been talking about just that, while hiking in Washington state, where he now lives. He had to give it more thought. A few days later, he texted a picture of his new hiking shoes: ""I'm in."" We'll have more company along the way—a couple friends, my daughter, and son are planning to meet us on the trail at different locations. 
It's a big deal to up and leave for five months. I'm thankful to have the support of my wife, Whitney, and the encouragement of my family and friends. I'm a lucky guy.

We started our hike in Amicalola Falls State Park, Georgia. This is where the ""approach trail"" to the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) begins. It's a 8.8-mile trail to the top of Springer Mountain (elevation: 3,782 ft.), which is the official starting point of the A.T. The approach trail was originally part of the A.T. in the 1930s, and besides, what's an extra 8.8 miles when we are about to do 2,190! I'm hiker number 2259 and Dan is 2260. 4,000 hikers are expected on the trail this year, and according to past statistics, only 25% will finish. 
Last night we stayed in a lodge in the state park. The sound of a cold, hard wind blowing outside kept me awake. The temperature was 31°F when we started at 8:21 this morning; it's another chilly and windy day with a high of 45°F. 
The approach trail began with 604 stair steps up the face of the Amicalola waterfall. With my 37-lb backpack, it was quite a challenge! After that, we had rolling hills, terrain with moderate climbs. Then, 2.5 miles in, it began to sleet and snow. We got to Springer Mountain at 12:40 p.m.--the official start. From there, we continued to Stover Creek shelter, making today's hike a total of 11.6 miles. 
We met a few people today, from Chicago, Texas, New Orleans, and other places. And found one gentleman sitting with his head down who said, ""Don't talk to me!"". Apparently he was having an existential crisis. Weird. 
A freezing night here in the Stover Creek camp ground, only able to sleep a little. We expect it to warm up soon.

Today we left Stover Creek shelter and hiked 12.9 miles to the Gooch Mountain shelter. It was very scenic and we saw several mountains--that is, we'd finish going down one mountain and then see another we'd have to go up. This is what they call P.U.D.S, ""Pointless Ups and Downs"". But it is really very pretty. 
We stopped at a couple rivers to replenish our water supply. Since it was warm today we got pretty thirsty, but there is plenty to drink. We came across a lot of people on the trail, and are spending the night among a group of about 20 here in the shelter and nearby tents. 
Nice day today and tomorrow should be just as nice!

y not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587412,"Today was a mountainous hike from the Gooch Mountain shelter to Neels Gap--another 15.4 miles. We started at 7:15 a.m. (earlier than usual because we knew today's hike would be an arduous one), and finished at 3:45 p.m. 
In the afternoon, we crossed Blood Mountain (elevation: 4,457 ft.) Blood Mountain is an appropriately named peak. It was tough going up; it was tough coming down. Back when I was reading about this trip, in the comfort of my own home, I read that 25% of A.T. hikers quit by Neels Gap and I always wondered why. It's only 39.9 miles from our starting point, Amicalola Falls State Park, and only 31.1 miles Springer Mountain, the official starting point of the A.T. ... Well, now I know. I can understand why people would quit after all that difficult hiking and climbing, especially when the weather is so cold at the beginning. 
By midday we had excellent weather: sunny, blue skies, so whenever we got to the top of the mountains, we were treated to beautiful views. 
And tonight we sleep in a hotel. 
Charlotte, Dan's wife, who saw us off at Amicalola Falls, is staying around for our first few days. Now that we've been hiking for three days, she drove up to pick us up at Neels Gap, and took us to a hotel. (I just had a shower. Comfort.) Tomorrow morning, she'll take us back to the trail where we left off, we'll hike for two more days, then another hotel stay, and then one day of hiking and one more hotel. It's a big help, and I appreciate the effort she has put into this—thanks Charlotte! After day 6, she flies back home to Washington State and we're really on our own.

I had a big burger and french fries for dinner--oh that was so delicious--and then all-you-can-eat breakfast at the hotel--waffles, eggs....... needless to say, we ate quite a bit before heading back out to the trail. 
As I looked at the plan for today all I saw were mountains and gaps--up a mountain, down a mountain, gap, up, down gap... and so on. But a couple interesting things happened along the trail. At 8:20 this morning we had picked back up at Neels Gap. Gap, which means, we started out uphill. It was 55°F and the wind was blowing close to 30mph. That all made it... not too much fun. We had to bundle up to stay warm but the funny thing is, on one side of the mountain it's windy and cold, then on the other side: no wind, and you're facing the sun, which is always welcome.Along the way, we found this... display, right on the side of the trail at the foot of a tree, (see photo), then later on, we experienced our first *Trail Magic.* Trail magic is when people show up at some part of the trail, usually where it meets a road, and set up a camper or van or table with all kinds of food and candy just for thru-hikers (thru-hikers are hikers who intend to make it the entire A.T., like us!). It's all free, so we took advantage, had some drinks and candies and took a break before heading back up the next mountain. We reached our destination: Lower Gap shelter, a total of 11.5 miles later, at about 1:20 p.m. We made good time today, getting in earlier than expected. We found a place to set up our tents and relax in camp for the rest of the day. We've been through cold weather up here so far, and hear that the temperature is supposed to go down to freezing tonight, to which we say.... BRING IT ON!

As we left the shelter and began our ascent, we saw the most beautiful sunrise right above the mountain. You could see the sunlight reflect off the other mountains behind. The green of the trees against the golden glow of the sun was amazing. No picture would do this justice. We looked. We enjoyed. We continued on, and witnessed the sunrise again over a second higher mountain. 
At Unicoi gap, at noon, Charlotte picked us up to take us into the town of Hiawassee, GA to ressuply. We went immediately to a mexican restaurant. Then, after cleaning up and resting in the hotel room... we pigged out again at the Hawg Wild BBQ and Catfish House. Now we're getting ready to go to sleep before another early start. Tomorrow we will ""slack pack""—that is, leave our backpacks behind and just carry lunch and water. It will be our longest day—16.7 miles, but without the heavy pack, should be great.

Since this was our slack pack day, it was great! Whenever we saw a mountain coming up, we didn't think twice—no 35-lb backpack to haul up this time. We hiked about a mile with a volunteer from a group in Georgia who helps maintain the trail. Cool! And later on, in a clearing, we met Keith, who was there with his wife, providing *Trail Magic!*—an assortment of hot and cold drinks and goodies to eat. It's always nice to see that, and it's awesome of him to be out here on this windy, chilly day. We stopped and chatted with him for a bit. Thanks Keith! Overall, an uneventful day of great hiking and beautiful vistas. Charlotte was waiting for us at the end of today's hike, and now I'm in a hotel with my legs up on a pillow, resting before dinner.

y not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587653,"Today we are taking an unplanned zero. A ""zero day,"" as you might guess, is a day on which you do no hiking. Strong thunderstorms and heavy winds have moved in. Last night we knew there might be some weather, but still planned to leave in the morning. Then at breakfast I said to Dan, ""What's plan B?"". He said ""Let me get my coffee, then we'll talk about it."" Dan had been up at 2:00 a.m. already thinking about this. At first we considered hiring a car service to pick us up later in the day so we could slack pack, but without cell-phone coverage there would be too much risk missing the meeting point/not being able to contact the driver, and being stranded without our supplies. And we looked at the radar and forecast, and decided it was too dangerous to be out there at all, especially when the storm is more extreme up on the mountains. 
So as I sit here in the hotel, some thoughts about the A.T. so far:When we started, back at the lodge at Amicalola Falls, there was a 3-story tall map of the entire A.T. in the lobby. On day one I knew what I was getting into, but standing at the bottom floor looking up at the end point I thought-- ""holy moly that is so far away!"" ... And I was excited. Excitement got us up those first 604 steps. Excitement helped us set up camp after that first cold and snowy day. Every night as we arrive at our campsite after a long, tiring hike, we think, ""I could be home in bed right now, instead I'm freezing in the woods, what are we doing here?!"" Then I fall asleep, wake up the next morning, and have the answer. It's awesome being on the trail. So beautiful. Often while we're hiking we're just looking down, being careful where we step, and we have to remind ourselves to look up, look left, look right, so we don't miss the beauty that is all around. So, we get up, get hiking, warm up. Then go through the cycle again. 
I consider myself to be physically fit, and mentally strong, and hiking the A.T. takes both, (more-so the latter). By the second day, my body started asking, ""What are you doing to me?!"" My shoulder aches, though I keep adjusting the straps on the backpack; my left knee is tired of coming down steep hills; my right calf.... Suffice it to say, the body is complaining. As a long-distance runner, I expected this, and am able to manage it. As the days go on I feel stronger. After five days of hiking, 78 miles covered, I'm feeling good. 
Tomorrow by 9:00 a.m. the worst of the storm will have passed, and we'll trek on, taking it easy if need be. Every mile is one closer to our destination. There will be miserable days, there will be awe-inspiring days, and through it all, I'm enjoying this.

Having already taken a zero yesterday because of heavy rain and wind, we decided to go. John, a resident of Hiawassee had a van service that took us back to the trail for a fee, and we picked back up at Dicks Creek Gap at 8:50 a.m. On the way to Standing Indian Shelter, we will get to North Carolina. Yay! One state down, 13 more to go! We were welcomed to NC by a doozy of a climb. It was harder still since it rained all day. After 16.7 miles, the usual: set up camp, cook, eat, go to sleep.

So far, I have made three mistakes. The worst was coming out of the shelter back to the trail—we made a wrong turn and it was about 2 miles before re realized; thats 4 additional miles today. We'd previously agreed that the person following should double check the turns, so this one's on me.
A couple days ago, I was cooking mashed potatoes, and was hungry so I reached over for tuna to mix in and accidentally knocked over the pot. This little stove is pretty unstable so just barely touching it, it goes down. No dinner that night! Then, when trying to inflate the airpad, I noticed it was taking too long... because I hadn't plugged in the hole that lets the air out. Welp, I will be making a lot more. Onward!

This shelter accommodated eight people. One of them was called Fright Train (his trail name), and soon it was easy to figure out why. Freight Train is the loudest snorer I have ever heard!

To answer your questions so far... 
Yes! We've seen snakes, deer, chipmunks, rabbits, squirrels, and birds (in many pretty colors), and we hear about bear sightings but have yet to see one. 
Dan has a trail name! Seatac, after his home-base airport in Seattle. 
The toughest part of the trail has been Albert mountain, (elevation: 5,200 ft), back in Georgia. We're climbing more and bigger mountains here in the Smokys, but maybe we got used to it because that early one was the hardest. No issues with altitude, though.
I am most sore in the shoulders. My feet are fine! The tape really helps prevent blisters. 
We've crossed paths with a lot of hikers but never stay with a group, everyone continues at their own pace. We only chat with others in the shelters. 
I'm sleeping well. We're so tired when we get to camp we pass right out, even when there are other people around. 
We will just miss the Appalachian Trail Days Festival in Damascus (Virginia), but that's ok, we're here to hike, not party.

As luck would have it, there was an ER physician in one of our shelters; I told him what I was feeling and asked his opinion. He recommended I get an EKG as soon as possible, and probably some blood tests. From that point, we knew the quickest way to do that was to exit Great Smoky Mountain National Park at Davenport Gap and go to Asheville, NC.

Once she met us, I told her what was up, and she found a hospital in Asheville to take me to. I got my EKG and blood test, and everything was normal. The hospital staff knew I was hiking the AT and wanted to continue, so they kept me overnight for observation to be safe. 
Today, they did some additional tests including a stress test, that also didn't show anything wrong. I talked to the cardiologist around noon and asked if I should be worried. He said, as with anything, no guarantees, but he didn't see any problems. Maybe it's just all the carrying a backpack uphill. Concerned readers: all is well. :)
When I was released, Vicki picked me up and brought back my clothes which she was kind enough to clean. Then she took Dan and I to REI to resupply, then to Five Guys for the burger and fries I was craving for lunch. 
Meanwhile, Vicki's parents, Mike and Marcia have been overwhelmingly welcoming. They let Dan stay with them while I was in the hospital and had us both over today. Vicki made dinner for everyone as well. I very much appreciate her and her family for going out of their way for us. Thank you all!

We went 18.1 miles from Davenport Gap to Roaring Forks shelter. The hike started with a downhill, then we crossed I-40, west of Asheville, and started a long, long climb. Even though we'd taken a zero yesterday, it was pretty hard going. And it was worth it—amazing view from Max Patch, the peak. From there, we went downhill to the shelter and settled in for the night.

But luckily, by the time we arrived today, the fire had been put out and we were able to go through. We hiked 17.9 miles from Roaring Forks shelter to Hot Springs and had a beautiful day with a few showers in the afternoon. There were some very long downhills, then the trail takes you right through town. We went looking for a hotel and ended up at the Magnolia Mountain Inn, an old victorian house overlooking the mountain. It's a really tiny town so we walked around looking for a restaurant: one was closed for cleaning, a second was closed for repairs. Burgers it is!

Then we set back out: back down the main street of town, left across a bridge over French Broad river, right to follow the river, left and then up up uphill. We came across another hiker coming down the mountain who told us, ""You're going the wrong way!"" He didn't mean we were lost, just that we had so much left to climb, haha. But we knew that was the case. We ascended from 1,320 ft to 4,740 feet. Quite a climb, but fun, on a sunny, beautiful day. We also met a hiker named Fearless, a girl from Oregon, sitting by a water source. On the trail we stick to our trail names.

From there we could see a thunderstorm at a distance. Of course this is the worst place to be in a thunderstorm, but the sight was amazing. And at the same time, scary—there were drops on either side of the mountain. By the time we got to the shelter, the storm had passed and the skies cleared, so we set up our tents and cooked dinner. We also saw Not Yet and Nick again. All of a sudden, around 9:30 p.m., we did get a thunderstorm, with hail and heavy wind. I thought the tent was going to fly away with me in it! That was really scary, at least it only lasted half an hour. The rain stopped, back to sleep. Later on, another batch of rain, but this time not so bad!

David and Janet offered a selection and I got a ham and cheese sandwich with Fritos and a cold drink. What a nice surprise! As we approached Erwin, Whitney came up to meet us on the trail so she got to hike a bit of the AT and we all went back down. She also brought some iced cold Coca Cola-- sooo good after a hot day!

The 18.4-mile hike was tough; the usual ups and downs felt especially difficult.
We also took a slight detour. We came across a sign that said there were waterfalls to the right off the trail--worth taking a look. Normally, hikers don't want to take a side trail because we're already walking long enough. But we went, and it was worth it. We sat there a while by the beautiful Jones Falls. We also went by a large river; watching the water flow down was another beautiful sight.
We reached our destination, and, for the first time, had a shelter all to ourselves. Tonight it rained hard, and it was nice to listen to the rain while nice and comfortable inside.

The weather was nice--a little bit of rain, but overall the overcast sky made for a nice, cool day. Helpful, since we went over more hills today. Amy and Zoey have been killing the uphills! so we've let them take the lead. While Dan and I have been out here four weeks and have our ""hiking legs"", the one thing they have on us is age. They can take the uphills much faster than we, or I can, (I hope I'm not slowing Dan down!). They let us catch up at the top and then keep going. 
We saw several more waterfalls today, and crossed some bridges over a river in Tennessee. It's really pretty being out in the middle of nowhere with trees and greenery all around. We came across one section with a 2-ft-wide ledge we had to pass through. On one side: huge rock, on the other: river. Zoey was in the lead when she stopped, froze, and came running back. ""Snake!"" There was a rattlesnake sitting there, and no way around it. Dan said, ""I'll take care of this!"" and with his hiking poles, tried to grab and push the snake off the ledge. He pushed it into the water and we watched it swim to a rock, then back across the river to the other side. They are quite the swimmers! 
At the end of the day, when we got to the hostel, they took us to McDonalds for dinner and the Dollar Store for a resupply. Ready to get going tomorrow!

When we arrived at the shelter, there was only one other person--Blasto, from Wisconsin, a retired thru-hiker who we've seen and talked with several times before. Since there was plenty of room, and we were expecting rain, we decided to stay there that night. Then, as we sat around in the shelter, Amy jumped; ""Mouse!"" (As it happens, a lot of the shelters have mice in them.) Then Zoey jumped; ""I don't know if I want to stay here tonight!"". Then it started raining. I don't think Amy slept well, thinking about the mouse, but the little guy was minding his own business and never came around. And the shelter was a great idea, it rained hard.

After 5 weeks and 480 miles of hiking, we have arrived in Damascus, VA, at which point I have decided to end my journey. As you know, back in Asheville, I had to go to the hospital to have the discomfort in my chest checked out. Even though the cardiologist didn’t find anything, he couldn’t make any guarantees about my continued wellbeing on the trail. At that point, I decided to get back on the trail to see how things would feel. I noticed that things weren’t getting worse, nor were they getting better, especially on the more difficult climbs. I set Damascus as a goal, it seemed like a logical place to stop.
As you all know, my friend Dan was hiking with me. He has decided to continue the hike towards Katahdin. I feel bad abandoning him, but feel like I need to put my health first. I don’t think what I was feeling is anything to mess around with considering how isolated we sometimes were on the trail. I wish Dan all the best and I’ll be tracking his progress. 
Thank you to all our followers for your words of encouragement and good wishes. This has been an amazing journey. Before I set out in April, I didn’t quite know what to expect. It has surpassed all expectations — from the people I met on the trail, seeing spring unfold, the variety of vegetation we saw as we climbed, to the stunning vistas. Time seems to run slower on the trail. Even though it’s only been 5 weeks, it seems like it’s been much longer than that. You lose all concept of time and your brain isn’t overwhelmed with the intricacies of daily life. If you were to ask me if I’d do it again, my answer would be an overwhelming “yes.""
