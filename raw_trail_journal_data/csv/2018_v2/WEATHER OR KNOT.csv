WEATHER OR KNOT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597534,"<img src=""/images/photos/journals/Appalachian trail/2016402_114331.jpg"">I am departing today for Bangor Maine where Phil from the 100 mile Wilderness Hostel in Monson Maine is picking me up.  I have a park permit to climb Mount Katahdin on Monday July 23rd. Phil will drop me off that Monday morning where I will check in with the Ranger station and finalized my permit, hike to the top and return to the Abol Slide camp area for the night. Then Tuesday head out southbound and the journey begins. I have a few down days until Monday so Phil has arranged for me to slack pack both Friday and Saturday, taking Sunday off to get rest and check out my gear. Slack packing is great as you get in larger miles each day without the burden of a 33lb pack, instead carrying a light pack with food and water. I hope to get about 10-12 miles each day as I have taken the last few weeks off hiking and need to get back into the groove.

Once I enter the 100 mile wilderness I will be out of any service range. It should take me about 2 weeks to hike back to his hostel in Monson and I will update both the map and my journal then. Phil has provided another great service where he takes half your food and drops it off in the middle of the wilderness in a lock bock. That should take about 5-7 pounds off the pack for that first week.

I got up this morning and completed last minute packing of the backpack. Minus water I am coming in right at 33 pounds. A little more that I planned but I added a thermal liner and down blanket for my sleeping bag and an extra set of clothes. Weather at Mount Katahdin is expected to be in the low sixties when I climb then until I reach the White Mounts in the lower 80s daytime and 50s at night. Perfect !
Then there are those White Mountains. Forecast is lower 60s for the highs and lower 40s at night - Burr!! That summer weight bag would not keep me warm, hence why the extra clothes and blanket.
Marilee and I have a biking vacation set for the first week or October in Vermont. By then I should be well out from the White Mountains and will get off the trail somewhere close to Albany NY where we will meet and drive up to Burlington Vermont for the trip.  We used this company before (Vermont Bike Tours) and they are great. We intentionally picked these dates to hopefully ride Vermont at the peak of the fall colors. Marilee will then drop me back on the trail before heading back to the Albany airport and home.

Over the last week I began putting my gear together and packing. Riley must know I am going again as he follows me around everywhere and sniffs every piece of gear. I sense he smells the trail from before and must be thinking he is going again too. He even took one of my hiking socks out and I found him asleep this morning with the sock closely nestled under his head as he slept. I know this is going to be an emotional goodbye not only with Marilee but with Riley once he realizes I am leaving without him this time. This is the one difference between the two trips I already know I am going to greatly miss, my hiking buddy Riley...… next journal entry...","Fort Collins Colorado

WEATHER OR KNOT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597541,"After departing the trail in Pennsylvania in 2016, I went back home in Colorado reflecting on the trip.  I was both thrilled for the accomplishment I did and the experiences I encountered yet disappointed with myself for not finishing.  As for those of you that know me, I always finish what I start and this was not me. I struggled to understand what got lost over the months that I am still seeking that kept me thinking about this. Why would I even consider finishing? What was it about the trip I miss? 
At first I thought sending Riley home when I reached Washington D.C. was the big factor as my hiking buddy was no longer with me. I missed his morning routine crawling out of mine or some other hiker’s sleeping back he crawled into in the middle of the night and waking me up, or his afternoon romp around the campgrounds visiting all of the hikers but it was more than just Riley. Marilee and I would lay outside at night on our lounge chairs enjoying the star studded Colorado sky where I pondered if I would ever go back and finish. It was a hollow gratification as I could not really understand why I did quit other than the obvious that I was tired, bored and hiking from sunrise to sunset every day and was not fun anymore. Everyone would ask if I intended to go back and finish to which I would always say yes, yet deep down I was not sure if I at age 63 wanted to invest three to four more months on the trail.  
Early this year I made the decision to finish but the reality was my heart was not really in it and the only motivator so far was all the money I spent on new gear and the fact that I told everyone I was going – Gee no pressure there!  As much as the preparation moved forward I simply could not find a motivator and feared I would again stop for the same reasons. I decided to read my 2016 journal in its entirety non-stop, something I have not accomplished yet. After about three passes of the journal I began to see a pattern the cleared the picture up for me.
I began 2016 with expectations of a great life adventure, exploring America and its history along the Appalachian Trail, visiting sites like Gettysburg along the way, interacting with folks from the deep south with their southern hospitality to the Revolutionary days of the east coast corridor to the industrial age of the Northeast U.S. As I read it was clear by my writings this trip was quickly becoming exactly what I had hoped for and every day was an adventure and I was happy. What happened?
As I read I could see over time the trip changed in ways I did not understand until now. During the first third, my writings were clearly full of adventure and excitement. Commissioner bringing 12 McDonald hamburgers from town to the next shelter for all of us to eat to only be confronted by a hungry bear that decided he liked hamburgers as well. Riley after an exhausting hike jumping into a mountain river, backpack and all, running back and forth across the river from hiker to hiker mooching rubs and splashing everyone laughing and smiling at him. Heavy D bringing a rattle snake to the hostel he caught on the trail to cook it up – which we did. Bear Wall standing in fear of his life when mama bear approached us to find her cub as we all ran away leaving just him with mama bear. Dr Longspoon and Sassy stopping to help me with Riley after his near-death experience of hypothermia.
Over the months as I read, it became clear somewhere I changed the mission from adventure to logistics. The need to ensure I reached Mount Katahdin in the safe weather zone without risk of the mountain being closed due to winter snow quickly rose to the top of my hiking priorities. I saw I was beginning to panic by the midpoint as I was almost 100 miles behind my original plan and that safe zone weather window was quickly closing unless I picked up the pace. I already reached an incredible pace with my last week on the trail completed over 150 miles including my biggest day of 30 miles yet that was not enough. 
As I continued to read into the middle portion of the trip, my writings began to focus on logistics, whining from boredom and exhaustion from trying to go longer than I did the day before. No more did I plan shorter days to ensure I still had a daylight left at the end of each hike to enjoy dinner with others or a campfire, instead seeing by 7 in the morning I was already packed and off hiking until sometimes 9 at night coming into a shelter area in the dark. No longer was Riley frolicking around the campsite visiting other hikers at the end of each day, instead he would just lay down with his pack still on and fall asleep for hours ignoring the other hikers calling out to him. I remember going through Shenandoah National Park and missed everything it offered.  My exhaustion was just as bad as in the beginning but I was no longer having fun or enjoying the trip. I allowed the finish to be the one and only reason I was still hiking. My writings by this time did not include the volumes of meeting people like Trail Angels or towns folks stopping to help or give me a ride to town to resupply. No longer were there any writings about family campers along the trail stopping over to ask me to join them for breakfast and listen to my stories of the trail. The truth was I simply had no new stories according to my journal, instead writing about the boring green tunnel, brutal climbs and descends, and Bataan Death Marches each day. My only real writing of Shenandoah was about the fantastic fireflies that blinked in sequence. Yet the green tunnels started the first day I began, and the brutal climbs were just as bad on day one and there were now in the middle of the trip.
I remembered the movie “Into the Wild” a true story where Chris McCandless carved into a piece of wood the phrase “Happiness is not real unless it is shared”. I came to realize that is what I was missing. By Harpers Ferry, statistically 75 percent of the through hikers had already quit. The original 8 hikers I met in the opening day had all quit, as did the numerous hikers I met early on. By midpoint only the serious hikers were left and from Harpers Ferry on, I never again saw any of the original people, or anyone I would meet one day see again either. As everyone was now on different paces the people you saw one night were not the ones you would see the next night. For all practical purposes we had all become nothing more than passing ships in the night. Conversations were more about gear, resupply points, and what laid ahead. Campfires became a rarity as most hikers went to bed as soon as dark set and many were gone before the sun even rose in the morning. Trail angels were all but extinct and small town America gave way to the industrial belt of the U.S. with major cities all around us. 
I realized Chris McCandless (Into the Wild) was right; happiness is only real if shared. In the beginning I would show my blisters and others would follow comparing and competing that had more blisters, etc. Those 20 to 30 something lost soul, pot-smoking, homeless hikers became an integral part of my trip and I missed them. Heavy D would take that snake and scare people with it, all at the same time firing up stories from everyone else. Yes we all commiserated together up but it was what made the day fun and was part of the adventure. We would play tricks on each other, or find a great reason like Stink Mouse’s Shelter-clearing fart in the middle of the night to give a hiker a trail name. I would stop and actually sit with the Trail Angels rather than just take the food then keep hiking like I did later on.
The reason I took the trip was to have an adventure that would last me a lifetime so that had to be part of the plan for me to finally get motivated to return and finish. I decided the first change would be to flip flop, meaning instead of returning to the point where I got off and continue northbound. Instead I am heading first to the end at Mount Katahdin Maine and hike south bound back to the point I got off at in Pennsylvania. This way I would get through both Katahdin and the White Mountains well clear of risk of snow endangering the trip. I also would have the advantage of hiking the hottest and wettest months in the cooler Northeast reaching mid America in early fall and enjoy the changing season as I hiked. I decided to not have a specific end date in mind that would require hiking a certain amount of miles per day, instead living and hiking in the moment. No more spending 20 minutes to see such great sites as Gettysburg. Instead I will generally plan to complete the hike around late October into early November or even longer if needed. But most important I will make the time to stop and smell the roses. This time when hikers asked me to join them on an off-trail expedition or side trip for a few days, I will say yes, or make my own plans to visit the sites I love to see. 
The only thing missing this trip of course will be Riley and I will miss him dearly but I owe it to him and myself to complete this trip and make it an adventure that I always dreamed up since my early childhood days where I would ponder following railroad tracks across the U.S. to explore.
For everyone following my journal I want to say thank you and for your support and hopefully give you many hours of enjoyable reading about one old guy having a great time on an incredible journey and accomplishing a dream of a lifetime.

WEATHER OR KNOT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597542,P.S. I will keep my journal updates as I hike and when I reach somewhere with computer access I will add to the journal. Considering the area around Katahdin and the 100 mile wilderness is void of technology it should take me two to three weeks to get back to the 100 mile wilderness hostel in Monson so please check back for more. Also if you would like I am using Garmin's Earthmate to track my progress. Each night I will flag my position for you to follow my track and progress.

WEATHER OR KNOT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599412,"Summit Mount Katahdin through the 100 Mile Wilderness to the Kennebec River, Caratunk Maine. 
July 19th to August 5th. Eighteen days and 151.2 miles
Chapter One - The Summit
Arrived at the Bangor Airport and met by a local guide to drive me up to Monson Maine. Uneventful flight from Denver to JFK airport where upon approach I could see the new World Trade Center gleaming in the sunny afternoon New York City skyline. It was a beautiful building and reminder of my military days after 9/11 deploying to combat operations into 22 countries before I would end near continuous operations worldwide until mid summer of 2006. My proudest deployment of my entire career was when then President George Bush ordered federal takeover of all rescue operations under Lt General Honore’ after the levees of New Orleans began to fail flooding nearly every part of the city in a deep oily murk of water. I got the call around 7am that morning asking if our unit could be available by evening for pick up and transported via a USAF C-130. We landed in the pre dawn early morning hours next day at Belle Chase Naval Air Base that would become the primary rescue operations center and grow to over 80,000 military and civilian personnel supporting Joint Task Force Katrina.
As we approached Monson I admired the beauty of the area very similar to my home state’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) and Voyagers’ National Park on the Minnesota / Canadian border - minus the huge mountains of course. As I got of the car the first thing I heard was the sound of loons on the numerous lakes bringing a sense of comfort. I knew my journey had now began and the Appalachian Trail would be my home for the next three to four months.
I made my flight reservations before my permit reservations to climb Mount Katahdin resulting in my arrival four days early. I would not climb Katahdin until Monday. Not wanting to lose days sitting around I decided I would take advantage of the time and reverse hike part of the trail in front of me from the Kennebec River back to Monson. It was a good warm up, not very difficult and a chance to test out my trail legs. The weather was awesome and I arrived back in Monson on Saturday just in time to be part of the town’s annual festivities including music and food on the beach of nearby Lake Hebron and fireworks that night. I stayed at a local hiker’s hostel waking up around 6am to a bright sunny day and more sounds of loons. The forecast for Sunday night and all Monday into Monday night was heavy rains and thunderstorms associated with the remnants of a tropical storm churning up the U.S east coast. This was not the weather I had hoped for but then I am hiking the AT as the Appalachian Trail is referred to by hikers and locals. The weather held to its forecast with overcast arriving around lunch and thickening with light showers by dinner time. 
I went into town for dinner at a local favorite Lakeshore Restaurant and decided to sit outside next to the lake as the rain stopped and partial clearing let sun in for a while. I got seated at a table with three sisters and one of their children, a teen age daughter. Jerry, who was also hiking the 100 mile Wilderness section of the AT joined me. Jerry was a Maine native and the three sisters were also from Maine with one now living in Connecticut. This is an annual event for the three sisters to get together at a local camping lodge near the lake. We talked for a couple of hours over dinner together laughing as we took shots from politics, to pot to children and everything in between. It was a great end to Monson. I arrived back at the hostel coming across two hikers from Vermont who came to hike the 100 mile wilderness. They would head north out of Monson while I would be driving to the start of the AT in Baxter State Park, home of Mount Katahdin. We talked for a while and promised to say hi to each other as we passed going different directions. The owner of the hostel was back and asked if I could get the Vermont couple’s car from the AT trailhead parking lot about three miles up the road so off we went. When we arrived the car was a Prius of which neither of us ever operated. For thirty minutes we kept on trying to start the car to only figure out after reading the owners manual that in fact the car was already started and because if ws electric there was no engine noise. By this point we laughed like the idiots we were expecting an engine to start. Back at the hostel the rain began to increase to a steady downpour so I went to my cabin, ensured I was all packed and went to bed. I was to be picked up at 6am for the drive through Millinocket to Baxter State Park.
Monday morning arrived and I was up around 5am. A quick breakfast, gear check and out the door I went into the all-night steady downpour. The surrounding ground around the cabin was now small lakes of water. Estimates for rain today was 2 inches. As we left Monson we stopped at a local store / gas station the makes home made breakfast burritos and a cup of coffee. 
I arrived to Baxter State Park around 7:30 at the Abol Stream Campground Ranger Station. He assigned me to Lean-To #11 and gave me instructions for signing in before climbing. I grabbed the gear I wanted to hike with including a special lunch I prepared including a Lindt’s 70% pure cocoa chocolate bar to eat when I reached Baxter peak some 5300 feet above me. I put my gear into a small loaner back pack the park offers leaving my full pack in the ranger station. By 8:30 I was ready to go and headed back into the ranger station to sign in and began both the summit and AT hike. Rain was again picking back up from showers to a steady rain. As I entered the ranger station he was helping a young woman and I could hear she was assigned Lean-To 12, next to me for that night after the summit. She looked at me with a smile and said hello as I was wondering about her hair style. When I first entered I could only see the left side of her, with everything I would expect including mid length hair style, but as she turned the entire right side of her head was shaved. Of course all of my old-man, military conservative values kicked in trying to figure her out. We talked for about two minutes as I completed the summit log and wished her well as she did the same.
The summit would be a 4.4 mile climb up the Abol Slide route and return 5.2 miles down the Hunt/AT route ending at the Katahdin Stream Campsite with a short hitchhike on the park road back to Abol Stream Campground. I gave myself to around 11 am to reach the top of the Abol Stream trail that ended at Thoreau Springs intersecting the AT around 3.4 miles up. By now the rain was pouring and visibility had dropped to near zero as the clouds now hid the entire upper half of Mount Katahdin. It was a brutal and grinding climb far worse than I imagined. By the time I got to the last quarter mile, the grade increased to the point that hiking was all but impossible and now I was just climbing huge boulders like a latter with my poles stashed. My GPS told me that it took that last quarter mile one hour and twenty minutes to complete and I reached the Spring at 1:00, not the 11am I had hoped for. The smell of pine filled the forest as I climbed but by the time I got near the top I entered the Alpine Zone where fully grown pine trees over a hundred years old were only two feet high. By the time I reached the springs nealy all plant life had disappeared with mainly moss on rocks and tiny plants between them. I began to panic a little as this was really late and I had one more mile to go to reach the summit of Baxter Peak. I turned right and came across a couple with a German accent and asked them if anyone else was on the summit. They indicated they thought there was one more person behind them. Visibility had all but obscured everything and the lack of any reference points just increased my panic. I literally could not comprehend if I was seeing five feet or five hundred feet ahead. Everything was grey as both the cloudy sky and the rocks I was hiking on were nearly identical in color. Panic turned into fear as I stopped looking for the white AT marks on rocks instead following my GPS to the summit. I was near what is called the Knife’s Edge where literally one foot would be on one side of the mountain and the other foot on the other side of the mountain. Visions of me hiking off the side of the mountain and to my death further ingrained my fears. I never found that other person and it was now almost 2pm. The fear grew as I neared only to turn into what was now debilitating fear when I heard what sounded like a distant rumble of thunder. My GPS said I was there and the only thing I could focus on now was getting off the mountain. I knew I was alone and disoriented by the near zero visibility. The thought of stopping for my congratulatory lunch and the requisite picture of standing at the sign of the peak never even entered my mind. I just simply stopped and began heading back to the spring and intersection of the AT/Hunt trail to get off the mountain. All I could focus on was my GPS now set to 0.1 mile scale to ensure I did not hike myself right over a cliff. I was now out of water as I passed the spring but never stopped. Water was not important anymore, just getting off the mount. After nearly two miles, I saw what was the edge of the Alpine zone with all those small pine trees and plants. Gripping fear relented to just panicky fear as I headed down the mountain, failing to stop for anything other than a pee break, GPS fix and catching my break. By 4pm I was well into the thick forest and pines and half way down the mountain. I looked ahead to see the clouds lifted a little and for the first time I could see down into the mountain valley with trees, and lakes. All fear suddenly left and I realized how exhausted and thirsty I was. I needed to take a break for a few minutes, and as I say down I realized I even forgot to eat my special lunch. I really enjoyed the two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches plus the candy bar I brought. I gulped down the remaining water I had, filled up by two water bottles and refilled them and downed them both as well from a small stream. I used my Steri-Pen to filter the water. I again filled the two bottles but never used them as I reached Katahdin Stream Campground and the end of my summit around 4:45, and by 5:15 back at Abol Stream Campground, signing in at the Ranger station and headed for my lean-to where I simply laid down on the wooden floor and stared at the ceiling. I had done it, no fanfare, no celebration, just shear exhaustion and relief it was finally over.
By 7pm it was time to start rehydrating and prepare dinner, a freeze dried beef stew and vegetables. As I moved around the young woman I met in the ranger station that morning waived and asked me how it was. I told her my story. I told her that I felt like such a big baby for my panic attack and she laughed. After I ate she came over holding a water filter asking instructions how to use it. As I showed her we began a conversation that would last about two hours.
Her name was Jessica and she was 28 years old. She lived there in Maine and came to the State Park to get some quiet time away from everyone. She was not there to hike the AT but there to reflect. Our conversation began to transform my hike from a day of terror and exhaustion into what would become one of the most amazing ten days of my life as I would begin the hike the 100 mile Wilderness starting the next morning.
Jessica hinted that a relationship break-up was at the heart of her reflections. Somehow our conversation turned very spiritual. She described her beliefs in life, death and our spiritual presences. She and I had very similar views, both very much believing in God but not many of the religious views preached by most religions. She indicated she was struggling what to do with her life and was torn between entering the nunhood or becoming a mother. As we talked she asked my opinion which I would choose and without hesitation I said motherhood. I told her that many of my beliefs are based on my science approach to life and that science both proves there is a God and that we were meant to raise life as parents for the next generation of our species. She seemed content on my response. Then for some reason I still cannot understand why I did, I told her things about my life I never once have told to anyone else, not even my sister or my wife. This woman that just 12 hours earlier I had prejudged by her hair cut brought such a calm over me to share information that I have judging myself for six decades came out with out hesitation. She listened quietly as I talked. When I was done, she indicated it was time to go to bed, and as she raised she told me she believes god talks to her when she ask and that she somehow knew that I would get the answers I came for on this trip. I was a little caught off guard so I asked her just how does she ask and how does God answer. Do you actually talk to god? Do you actually hear God? Etc. Etc. She said non of the above that whe just knows she needs help and guidance and somehow that answer is right in front of her emotionally. So I asked if I needed god to help me and asked would God respond. Her answer was as long as it was genuine and belief in a higher power. We left the night with that that would scramble through my mind over the next few days.
Chapter Two - The Hundred Mile Wilderness.
I was already awake around 4:30 as every muscle in my body was screaming “Oh No Mr. Bill, no more pain”. Sun was not up yet but the eastern sky was already lightening up. I sat on the picnic table making breakfast and being entertained by two chipmunks chasing each other. It was apparent they were playing as when one caught the other they would sit by each other to only a moment later one jumping up and running away with the other in hot pursuit. By six I was packed and ready to hike, Jessica has risen from her lean-to and wished me well. I thanked her for the conversation the prior night and again she told me to believe that God will answer you if you ask and really mean it. We shook hands and I left.
The park road was only about a hundred yards from the camp ground and I got a ride back to Katahdin Stream Campsite almost immediately. Apparently many vehicles are there transporting hikes and would stop for hikers. By 6:45 I was on the AT again and headed down the mountain to the Abol Stream Store and Campground just outside the park where the actual 100 mile wilderness begins. I reached the store where many hikers and cars were there. Some fore resupply and many who were hikers who were just hiking the 100 mile wilderness. As I entered the wilderness I stopped to take a selfy with the sign that informed me that I understand I am entering a wilderness area and that for all practical purposes I am on my own and if needed rescue it could be a really long time before they arrived - if they arrived!
By 4:30 I reached the first AT shelter, Hurd Shelter. No one else was there but by five it began to fill up, several that would become friends over the next twelve days. Wolf, a retiring 48 year old Army member was completing his fifth AT hike in is life. He was the true minimalist. His pack with food only came in around 10 pounds. No tent, just a ground cloth he would put over him as a tent. No sleeping pad or anything else of comfort. Just food, water, filter and one change of clothes. As we talked we saw an elderly man coming northbound into the shelter area. We could see he was in serious trouble crossing a stream. He was disoriented and immediately laid down on the shelter floor exhausted, pack still on. Wolf thought he needed salt and started looking for saltine crackers he had. His water bottles were empty and I asked him when was the last time he peed and what color it was. His adult daughter came in right behind me and heard hs answer to which she both chastised him for and began to help him. He stated that the last time he remembered taking water was around 10 am and did not know when was the last time he peed. He ended up eating in the shelter after getting water and never left the shelter floor until the next morning.
The next two to come in were two brothers from Georgia, Sam and Jake. They were hiking the AT for the first time and had just started two days before. Jake was a rabid fly fishing enthusiast. He carried a fly rod an no poles yet he would simply float over rocks as he hiked. Sam was the older brother who came along to keep Jake company. As it turned out neither had ever hiked overnight or backpacked in their lives. Apparently when Jake announced he was hiking the AT, dad informed Sam that he was going along and would pay the bill to ensure Jake stayed safe. Jake already had a trail name… Fish Fry… because he carried the fly pole and fished every stream and pond we passed over the next two weeks, and the fry portion because he was trying to put out a camp fire that got out of control so he stomped it out with sandals on that resulted in burns to the tops of his foot that required surgery just a few months prior. Sam still needed a trail name that would come just a few days later. Sam was a strapping guy around 240 pounds with a great beard, like the lumberjacks of ago. Both were seeking advice on gear indicating their packs weighed around 40 pounds each. I picked one up and state no way and guessed well into the 50s range. So they dumped their bags for us to check we several of us began to laugh. Sam was carried a round barreled boom box that had to come in around 8 pounds alone. He also had a huge double roll of duct tape, a Costco-sized large bottle of foot powder and Vaseline, toothpaste, etc. I joked that apparently he does not know that stores sell travel size products. They took the ribbing well and heeded our advise to rethink at the first chance what they are carrying. I quickly connected with these two all the way back to Monson.
As I headed out the next day, I came across Eddie at the top of Rainbow Ridge. Rainbow Ridge was a large rock outcropping covered in blueberries with a great view at the top. 
We sat there to admire the view and rest. Eddie was 28 and from Pennsylvania and hiking the 100 mile wilderness alone. Between Fish Fry, Eddie, Sam an myself we headed to Rainbow Stream for the night passing each other all day long. Usually Fish Fry would jump ahead and start fishing until we caught up. We reached Rainbow Lake where the brothers and I stopped and sat on the shores of this huge wilderness lake in awe of the views. Rainbow Stream shelter was just off the lake on the outflow side of the lake where the stream flowed through a beautiful gorge. I took off my pack, grabbed my soap and promptly sat in the river to clean off the hot humid day of hiking of sweat, bug repellant and dirt. After getting into my P.J.s….yes I carry P.J…. all clean, we all went to sleep as heavy rains again moved in. Around 11:30 we all heard a loud thud. The younger brother was calling out to his brother in the rain and we realized that the 16 inch diameter tree Jake had used to connect his hammock to at literally, roots and all came out of the ground with him in it. It missed his body by six inches, a story we all promised would not get back to his mother. The next morning Jake was now known as Treefall”.
For the next two days it poured cats and dogs. I had to stop multiple times to empty my shoes filled to the top with water and ring the sock out. The days were as brutal as they were wet with steep rocky and tree rooted trails washed out by years of erosion. By the third day we reached yet another huge wilderness lake where the rain stopped and the sun started to shine through. Over the last few days we kept hearing about this hostel called the White House where the owner picks you up by boat to take you to his location. Rumors were the food was beyond awesome and by the time we got to the dock just off the AT, I and Eddie decided we were going to go to that hostel. The brothers decided they needed to continue because they were planning to complete the trail by Thanksgiving. As the boat approached we said goodbyes and Eddie and I were off to the hostel. The place was nothing what we imagined and everything we dreamed of. It was a old fishing/hunting/snowmobile lodge. Cabins right on the beach with sun shining on a huge grassy landscape that led you to the dock and a sandy beach where we swam in pure clean and warm water. No electricity as the owner kept the character of the wilderness with propane mantle lights in cabins and a huge wood fired stove in the main dining room. Then came dinner. We all had to be at the dining room at 5pm as dinner was prepared and served by the owner and his wife. I ordered the burger while Eddie ordered both the burger and pizza. These were not your ordinary burgers or pizzas. Instead unbelievable gourmet meals. Homemade zucchini breads for openers. Pizza crust and hamburger buns home made from scratch straight out of the oven. Even the lettuce and tomatoes on top were just picked from their gardens growing just out the door. It was so much food that everyone that stopped for the night could not finish and the wife would wrap in foil for everyone to take back to their cabins. Eddie and I thought about the brothers and how they would regret their decision to go on. Eddie and I got a semi-private cabin right on the shore with a deck and rocking chairs on a porch overlooking this huge 20 plus mile long lake in the wilderness. Loons abound calling out filled the air. 
After dinner we sat on the porch as the sun was setting to see in the far off west thunderstorms building and lighting in the sky. Dark streaks of rain could be seen and we knew were in for another night of heavy rains, but we smiles knowing we would be dry and sleeping in a real bed with a real mattress. As the rains reached the lake in downpours we could see down the lake that somewhere the two brothers were getting pounded by rain. As I watched the rain coming down, the conversations with Jessica many nights before began dancing in my head. I kept pondering what she said and how wrong I was about my first impression. I somehow knew she was much wiser that I thought and with her maturity level. Eddie and I tried to sleep but to no avail. I came out of my room about the same time and we decided t 11:30 we would eat the remainder of the pizza. I suggest we fire up the propane stove and heat it up. Of course we had to figure how to start such and old style yet beautiful oven. After ten minutes the pizza was in. All of a sudden the smoke detector pierced the intense quiet of the wilderness. Eddie scrambled to find a chair and figure how to get the damn thing off the wall high next to the ceiling. He handed it to me where I tried to stick it under my shirt to quiet the piercing sound and ran to the window to began airing it out. After about two minute, peace returned. We laughed as we ate the pizza knowing that every other camper including the owners must have hear it. Of course our fears were confirmed the next morning by everyone at breakfast which was again another gourmet experience including hand picked blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup. We then boarded the boat back to the AT and continue the hike. Misting rain was still in the air as we departed but within and hour we were in bright clear sunny skies and less humid air. By lunch the sky darkened and we stopped at the next shelter to let is rain out. Within minutes it poured than stopped just as fast so we decided to continue on to Antlers Campground, a state campsite not affiliated with the AT. I needed water so I ran with my bottles to the spring next to the shelter as Eddie put his backpack back on. The water out of the spring was clear and cold but suddenly thunder clapped overhead and rain poured on my before I could get the 100 feet back to the shelter. We took our packs off anticipating a wait but again within ten minutes it stopped and the sun returned.
By 2pm we reached Antlers Campgroup. What a site. A peninsula of land stuck into another huge wilderness lake. With water on three sides the wind blew across the lake cooling us off and keeping the bugs at bay. Eddie set up his hammock on the two most far out trees right next to the water and I set up the tent about twenty yards away on a smooth soft ground with views all around me and an opening in the trees that would allow me to see the stars this night I hoped. It was a stunning location right out of a Normal Rockwell painting. After set up we went swimming in the lake with other hikers that had stopped there. As night approached we watched the sunset along with distance thunderstorms providing the grand view of nature’s fireworks across the sky. Loons singing again on the lake only broken by the sounds of bugs buried deep in downed tree trucks that made a unusual and cool sound. It took Eddie and I about 30 minutes to figure this out as it sounded like someone tapping a drum that echoed throughout the evening forest. We never figured out how they got in there or what kind of bugs but their sound was a soothing as the loons. We assumed it might be a mating call. It was nearing 9pm and a gentle rain began so off to our tents for what was so far without doubt one of the most memorial nights in my life camping out…..or so I thought…….
Chapter Three - My night of nights!","Mt Katahdin

WEATHER OR KNOT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599886,"........ The rain was a steady peaceful sound and the distant lighting was the perfect environment to put on my headphones and listen to music on my IPOD to fall asleep to. The constant sounds of loons across the lake combined now with bullfrogs croaking and those weird bugs in the trunks of the trees was more than I could resist so I decided to take off the earphones and listen to and watch natures concert. The distant lighting was lighting up the inside of the tent with the shadows of the tress reflecting down on the rain fly. The thunder was slowly getting louder and the time between the flash and bag was now around 12 seconds, about two miles away.  I remembered being up at Marilee’s family cabin by Grand Marias Minnesota close to the BWCA and Lake Superior. I knew she loved going up there as she loved to fish, especially the walleye from the lake the cabin was on. I wished she could be here. I loved that not only she liked to fish but she loved to eat them even more. She would literally clean them on the spot, coat them in a flour batter and fry them golden brown. We would make a home-made tartar sauce topping off without the best fish I have ever eaten. The more I thought about her the more I realized that over the years our vacations were really my vacations were really my vacations. Sailing trip here or bike trip there, etc. I promised myself that the next vacation would be what she loved to do no matter what – of course as long as I could go along.  I smiled hoping that somehow my brain waves were telling her to schedule our next adventure.
 
What happened next is beyond words I simply cannot really describe. The best analogy I can come up with is image a young adult living in a very rural Midwest farming America in the mid 1800’s, educated, hardworking the land, and void of anything technology. Then they are without warning suddenly in a huge IMAX theater with Dolby surround sound, vibrating seats showing a 3-D version of Jurassic Park. They simply would not be able to describe to anyone what they experienced and most would think they were delusional to explain huge dinosaurs come towards them in a tropical world beyond anything they learned in school. For me that is how I feel trying to explain my night. 
 
It was a combination of emotions, and image snippets of my life in both a chaotic yet understandable pattern telling me a story. There were no words, there were no voices, there we no one else there and I simply laid there.
 
I saw Riley as he was hiking the first part of the trail and the frolicking the did with other hikers begging rubs and trying to get them to play with him at night by the campfires we had. I laughed out loud at the thought then it turned to the night he almost died. I could see every second of that night and felt every emotion I experienced that night like is was happing now. I only glimpsed of that night in my early log but the details were clear and now.  That night Riley and I reached Neels Gap Georgia. The temps were already dropping and the forecast was for heavy rain, wind and snow mixed overnight. I set up my hammock on top of a small hill then headed down to a large campfire other hikers had going. Riley and I spent the evening talking with them for about two hours before the fire began to die down and everyone decided to hunker down in their tents as misting rain began. I knew from the previous three nights that Riley was cold so I tried to see if you would sleep in my hammock with me but to no avail. He wanted nothing to do with that hammock and jumped out so I tried to use my extra blanket in addition to the two blankets I brought for him to create a shelter under my hammock and large rain fly above me. Because Riley had over the last few nights decided to sneak out and go visit other hikers, I decided I would keep him on the lease attached to my wrist.  As the night progressed, the rain got harder and now a wind was rocking my hammock with me in it. I looked down and kept arraigning Riley’s blankets to keep him protected.  Around 4am I awoke to realize Riley and the lease were no longer there. The night on the mountain was pitch black and I was a little frustrated I would have to go find him. I turned on my flashlight and began to scan the hillside hoping to see him. I was quietly calling out Riley, Riley when leaves by a tree about twenty feet away moved. I called out Riley again and his head popped up. I called him but I could see he was having problems so I scrambled out of my hammock.  He saw me coming and tried to get up but each time he kept falling over. I knew at that moment he was in trouble. I got to him and realized that both he was in far more serious trouble than I thought and knew my trip was over. Riley was dying. He could barely hold his eyes open, could not stand up and was shaking so hard I knew he could not help himself. The rain was relentless and all I could do was hold him and comfort him in a pouring  cold rain. I knew I had to find a way off that mountain yet knew there was simply no help anywhere. I started to cry in my tent just like I did that night blaming myself for what I knew was going to happen. He was going to die. Then I saw a flashlight, then a second flashlight coming towards me.  It was the same hikers I shared the campfire with just hours earlier. The first immediately helped carry Riley back to my hammock and blankets, while the second, a woman ran back to her tent and pulled out her own sleeping bag, helping us get Riley inside it. Then more hikers came, two running back to restart the campfire with left over wood that was protected by an old structure from early days. Within minutes a half dozen hikers that I never met in my life came to my rescue. These were the same young hikers, like Jessica I met at Mount Katahdin, with weird long hair, dirty clothes all smoking pot the night before that I mentally judged harshly because they were different from me and in some way I believed not as good as me. By 6am the rain stopped and pre-dawn sunrise began to lighten the sky and mountains.  We moved Riley and I, still in the woman’s now soaked sleeping bag to a building that housed an outfitter business during the day. I had hoped that when they opened at 9 I could at least try to call for help. Two more hikers, Dr. Longspoon (he was not really a doctor, just his trail name) and Sassy approached. Longspoon  indicated he worked at a veterinary clinic and was studying to be a veterinarian. He took one look at Riley and stated Riley was in severe shock and that I needed to get him off the mountain and off the trail for at least three days of full rest. Sassy took out her own sleeping bag and hood to cover Riley in a dry bag with down to keep him warm. Riley was still shaking violently and other than opening his eyes like he understood we were helping him would close them and fall back to sleep. When the store opened Sassy went to call a “Trail Angel” to arrange a ride from Neel’s Gap to the Top Of Georgia hostel up the trail explaining the situation and asking if they would allow us to come with Riley to recover. The Trail Angel arrived around 1pm in the afternoon. Longspoon and Sassy stayed with me until the angel arrived. The hostel was great and other hikers helped me around the clock taking care of Riley. He never even got out of my bunk for food, water, anything. He simply slept all day and all night. By the third day I could see he was recovering. To this day and this night, I could still see all of their faces, Dr. Longspoon, Sassy, Percy, Sweet Feet, Stink Mouse, etc. etc. that group of misfits I so wrongly judged were more than just good people, they were honorable people and they were heroes who selflessly saved my dog. I think of them often and I wept this night as I did that night remembering them.  
 
Then the next story began. This time about one of the lowest points in my military career and one of the proudest moments in my military career.
 
The military unit I took over in 2000 to command was on the verge of being decommissioned. Several commanders had been fired, investigations of wrong doing showed this was a unit out of control and void of any values or honor. Somehow they felt they were there to party. The unit was categorized as non-mission capable, meaning they we incapable of meeting any standards to mission readiness and doing their job. At the request the local command structure asked the Air Force for a year to turn the unit around. By 2001, serious housecleaning resulted in the departure of those responsible, leaving the door open for junior leaders to take over. The Air Force came back and completed and IG Inspection, testing the ability to prove itself. This band of misfits and new comers not only proved their worth with a score of “Outstanding” but achieved a feat never accomplished before, a perfect score. No errors, no corrections, just perfection in everything they did.  9/11 came and now it was time to test the real capabilities of this unit.  At the time I was deployed to Andrews Air Force Base Crisis Action Team. An organization dedicated to operationalize units against mission orders and deploy them to combat operations. I saw my unit was ordered to support and deploy with the Army’s elite 82nd Airborne in an initial drive into Iraq and into the heart of Bagdad in the opening days of the Gulf War. I headed back to select the team including SMS Bob Simpkins to lead the team along with TSgt. Gardner and Christen with extensive experience. I took 12 members into a classified room to explain what is happening to them and what the mission was. Amongst them was Sgt. Brittney Brodin, Sgt. Elissa Magee both just 20 years old along with Sgt. Hanson. I could tell all were shocked as they knew they were going into combat, not just what you see on TV but real combat with real weapons and real people shooting at them. Sgt Brodin quietly raised her hand to ask a question which was “… I joined the Air Force so I could go to college… what does this mean…”. I chuckled a little in my head and explained it was time to pay back all that Air Force tuition she received. These were still kids in my eyes and I knew they were scared. By the time they completed they mission they drove with the 82nd Airborne directly into Bagdad in what is now considered the fastest, farthest, most mechanized troop offensive drive in modern warfare history. 
 
My lowest moment is when I got a call from the base classified command post asking if I had turned on CNN News. Of course they could not reveal any classified information over the phone but as soon as I saw the news I knew it was bad. They were deployed to a Forward Operating Base (FOB) and were under fire from unknown sources. The battle was still on as CNN was reporting it indicating casualties were reported. I thought my lowest moment would becoming the first commander at the base to lose a member… until my phone rang. It was Sgt Magee’s mother in panic wanting to know if her daughter was alive or dead. Of course the only way she would have known is if Elissa herself let her mother know where she was going. A no-no, but understandable a child confiding in her mother. Neither the command post or myself had any information to know who was injured or killed. As I had done before in my career before I became a commander, I punted the answer rather than being comforting and straight forward. I should have told her the truth that I did not know but that I know the team she is with are the best of the best and that I would keep her informed. Instead….I simply lied to her telling her that I already talked to the team and her daughter was safe and alive. I gave a mother false hope. I lied to a mother frantic about her loved one. I gave her the answer I knew she wanted to hear and that would help get me out this conversation.
 
As I hung up, I realized how I dishonored and selfish I was. I betrayed her confidence in me and could not comprehend how terrible it would be if the worst was reality. I accepted that I was nothing more than a coward and I never felt lower than I did at that moment.
 
Potential tragedy turned heroic as the command post called me in. It was a call from SMS Bob Simpkins informing the team was alive, safe and did their job with professionalism and honor, something I knew had none but now hidden by the turn of events. Never again would I lie. The team returned heroes to the base. Siren’s blasting with lights flashing bring the team from the Minneapolis Airport back on base. Family, friends, base personnel were all there to greet them, including Elissa’s mother who hugged me. I felt as low than as I did in that call.
 
Now my proudest moment. The leaders and those “kids” proved they were responsible adults and professionals under the most extreme conditions one could imagine. For his bravery under fire SMS Simpkins received the Bronze Star with Valor designation. The rest of the team received the Meritorious Service Medal and those two girls, well…. I got a call from the recruiting office wanting to know if MaGee and Brodin could be available on a certain date… available for what . For their actions and participation in the largest offensive in history the President of the United States wanted to meet them. The day came and Air Force One landed. I along with other base personnel would be able to watch from a distance as my commander, General Terry Tripp escorted Magee and Brodin to the steps of the aircraft as President George Bush descended to meet them. I watched as they chatted, shook hands and exchanged coins, giving the president our unit coin and he giving them his presidential coin. I stood there not at their commander but as “dad” proud of his girls. I started boasting to everyone around me that they were “my girls” and I could not have been more proud of them at that moment.
 
In the end I reflected on all of the unit now deployed all over the world over three continents resulted in the unit twice recognized as the NGAUS Outstanding Unit award, an award recognizing the top ten best units in the entire inventory and the U.S. Air Force Collins Award, recognizing the best combat weather team in the Air Force inventory.
 
As I smiled in the tent about those heroes, my mind shifted again this time to growing up and my mother. I had for years struggled with my mother and the life we led. Things as child I watched and endured as I grew older I simply could not forgive my mother for. How could a parent do such things not only to a child but her children.  As far back as I could remember I resented her and upon her death I felt no sympathy, just relief. My sister for decades told me I had to forgive her but I never could come to terms and acceptance. Yet this night I it was different.  I cried and laughed as my brain danced across everything she did for me. I saw the nights she would stay out with me watching the stars, something I now love doing with Marilee under the Colorado skies. I saw the hours she spent hand sewing patches onto my scout uniforms, or the baseball game she took me too. I grew up in a very poor family, where a father and husband disappeared to never be seen or heard from again, left a mother of four girls and one boy just days old with nothing. Yet I saw how my mother would hunt for coins so we could have bus fare to get to those games, or take me shopping to get gifts for Christmas.  She made every holiday special, fun and good. I could remember specifics meals she would cook for us and she was a great cook who found a way to stretch every dollar to house and feed her children.  In everyway that night all I could see was goodness in her.
 
We lived in a period of time that divorced mothers were seen negatively and children of divorced families as broken and to be avoided. Life for me was tough, not have a dad and having a last name of Darling was open season by bullies that would punch me, hurt me, call me names and make fun of me, and destroy my stuff.
 
As that story ended in my brain, I realized I was weeping with tears streaming down my cheeks onto my camping pillow. The tears were not of sadness but of joy. Who was I, I was thinking, to judge someone who found a way to survive and be a mother in so many ways. I accepted that for a woman with five children including a newborn baby left penniless by a selfish coward and alone in the 1950 was actually an amazing person, and her actions, like many of mine that I am not proud of were as out of desperation and fear. I looked upwards and quietly thanked her for giving me life, for taking care of me, and in the many ways showing me love. I told her she did not need my forgiveness because she did nothing anyone of us would do under the same circumstances. I apologized for not crying or caring at her funeral and told her that I loved her and missed her, and I hope that whatever her future holds that it will be great and she will be happy. She earned that in my mind.
 
By now the thunder and lightning was dancing directly above me, rain pelting the tent. I remember putting on my earplugs to listen to music and that was the last thing I remember of that night falling asleep wondering what just happened and how amazing it was.
 
I awoke to an absolutely beautiful day. The rain stopped and the view of the Maine wilderness on a small speck of land called Antlers Campground was what I always imagined. I knew today would be a great day and as Eddie and I began hiking out, all I could think of quietly hiking behind him relieving the night before. I awoke a different person that went to bed the night before. Somehow many of the questions I have been asking all my life were answered and cleared. Somehow I was at peace with myself and felt good about myself. I remembered that woman Jessica at Mount Katahdin and I kept asking myself, as she stated, that somehow if I asked a god I never really believed in for help, in fact does exist and somehow communicated with me.  As a scientist by nature and experience I kept coming to one and only one answer. A god far greater than anything I could imagine does exist and does listen.  I stopped on the trail as Eddie walked on and looked skyward and said quietly  “…Thank you God …” and a moment later I hear the sound of a loon. I smiled and started laughing out loud wondering if he replied back.","

WEATHER OR KNOT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599893,"As I hiked out of Antlers Campground I came across a large stretch of wild blueberries. I would grab a handful as I walked and eating them. I started to laugh again remembering that I just stopped and peed a few minutes back most likely in the same stretch of blueberries and wondered if anyone behind me was going to eat those things. Eddie and I reached Jo-Mary road, a gravel road used during the paper milling days and now used by owners to get to their cabins deep in the wilderness areas.
 
Jo-Mary Road was also the drop off site for my outfitter with my resupply of food for the second half of the wilderness. The drop box was hidden in the woods just a described including sodas and snacks.  When I opened the large box I was surprised to see several cases of soda’s, and boxes of both Little Debbie’s Swiss Rolls and Cakes. I love Swiss Rolls. At the road crossing were three other northbound hikers waiting for their resupply guy to show up. Apparently their stuff never made it and the outfitter was on the way out to bring them more. I could tell they were both frustrated and wanting of their supplies so I decided to take out five soda’s and two boxes of the treats, keeping two orange sodas for me and passing the Little Debbie’s around. We laughed as we consumed every single treat those two boxes had.
 
Eddie and I reached Cooper Brook Falls Shelter early afternoon. We did not plan to stop there but the view was awesome. A huge cascading waterfalls flowed right in front of the shelter. I hiked up the hillside to see if there was more to the falls and it just kept going and going around a bend and out of sight. Out front there was a fire pit and most of the dead wood was pretty dry so I jokingly told Eddie he was in charge of a campfire that night. Eddie did not disappoint creating the fire pile in perfection. It lit and grew in seconds into a fire that continued to glow well after we laid down in the shelter with three other hikers for bed. The shelter was right in front of the fire pit and the glow of the fire lit up the inside of the shelter with an orange tint. We all took a vote that Eddie would no long be Just Eddie but he would now be known as “Fire”, a name he seemed to enjoy.
 
The next several days would take us up over White Top Mountain. It was a steep long hike up but not brutal like other steep climbs. The local Appalachian Trail volunteers were their repairing decades of overuse and erosion by placing large stones to create a stairway. We watched as they found the right boulder uphill then transported it to a crew on the trail via a cable pulley system capable of transporting boulders as large as 3000 pounds.  Getting to the top of White Top was anything but a disappointment. The view was stunning. I could virtually trace back to every shelter and campsite area we stay at over the last week all the way to Mount Katahdin. You could see well past Katahdin to appreciate the vast area called the 100 Mile wilderness and beyond. As we descended White Top we came across about a dozen young and attractive women around 20 years old co9ming towards us northbound. They were section hiking the wilderness to Katahdin. When they spoke you could hear the very French accent. I asked them if they were from France, but they said they were French Canadians. Then one of them pulled out a T-shirt  and sked if we would sign their shirts as they wanted to bring that back home and show them all of the AT hikers they met. We did willingly and wished them well as we departed. That night Eddie, now Fire, again did not disappoint us as he built yet another awesome campfire for everyone to enjoy.
 
It was now my ninth day in the wilderness and Chair back Mountain laid ahead, a mountain the profile we all knew would be brutal. We along with two other hikers we met agreed our goal for the night would be Cloud Pond Shelter, some 16 miles away.  Little did we understand just how brutal Chair Back would be. It had so many monster ups and downs that each up was named first Chair Back, then Mountain One, Mountain Two, Mountain Three, Mountain Three and Half and Mountain Four before it was over. Fire and the other two hikers we started with were far ahead of me. I was exhausted, brutalized and demoralized. I kept asking why would anyone creating this trail following such a route with nothing to show for it. As I descending Mountain Three and heading for Mountain Three and Half I see a boy around 12 with tennis shoes, a fishing rod and a small school size backpack coming my way followed by two adults, mom and dad right behind in shorts and tennis shoes and no backpack. My brain is questioning what I am seeing, they did not fit, and even more they were clean, happy and having fun.
 
With a bewildered look I asked them if they are lost and how did they get here. The informed me they were staying at a beautiful lake lodge with cabins. Of course I said where and they pointed to this nicely maintained trail indicating it was a short easy 15-20 minute walk to the lodge. I am thinking to myself, WHAT, a lodge in the middle of the wilderness. Yes a lodge run by an organization called the Appalachian Mountain Club and Conservancy. They were there for a week, so I asked if that place might have both an extra room and food. They said yes and that dinner is family style with everyone staying there to be at dinner by 6pm. It was now around 4pm and my heart was not up to the next four plus miles of more Chairback Mountain so I mentally said goodbye to Eddie and followed them back to the lodge in hopes of a hot meal, hot shower and soft bed. Eddie needed to get back to work and intended the next morning to hike the last 20 miles in one day. Following them was the best decision I made. They had a cabin available with a shower inside and said they had enough food to feed me as well. What a decision it was. First the place was astounding in natural beauty.  Cabins on a wilderness lake, and a dinner feast of steak tips, potatoes, salad, fresh made hot bread, dessert, etc. I sat in my shower on the handicap bench for 45 minutes just soaking every single muscle that throbbed. Finally I left for dinner sitting with several families vacationing there. Many have come for years and I could see why. When the steak tips finally disappeared, there was still steak juice on the plate so I asked everyone at the table if anyone minded if I soaked it all up with the homemade bread. They laughed and passed the plate to me. 
 
After dinner I went back to my cabin with a covered porch to watch yet another awesome night of thunderstorm. Any guilt I had about abandoning Eddie and group disappeared knowing they were just miles from me sleeping in a pouring rain. I had no regrets.
 
The next morning breakfast was no less a feast then the dinner I had the night before including pancakes made with those wild blueberries – well at least hopefully not the ones I peed on. I was prepared to hike out right after breakfast, pack ready to go. The staff prepared me a lunch bag with a huge turkey and cheese sandwich, pickle spears, cucumbers and tomatoes, plus bags of cranberries. These would be my last two days in the wilderness.
 
On my last day I came across a family of five children ages ranging from 3 to 14 plus parents who have hiked the entire trail already and just a week or so from completion. Ben and Camy, dad and mom, stopped and talked to me about their adventure and the enormous help they received across the country in their journey. They were promoting  family values and staying together and even had a Y-Tube following everyone knew about. They were impressive and I could see the children loved the adventure. Mom indicated she was home schooling the children on the trail. Very impressive and I will assume someday they will be on national TV describing their adventures. After they departed I began what was to be the first of three river crossings requiring me to ford the river with pack on. I was a little scared on the first as sections were white water but in was easier than I imagined. I finally came to Highway 15 and hitched a ride back into Monson by a local who also lives in Rhode Island. He said everyone just calls him Whitey and was a retired union worker.
 
As I entered Monson I ran into the two brothers FishFry (Jake) and TreeFall (Sam) from Georgia. They got in the day before and resting at the hostel. I also ran into one of the two that I was supposed to meet at Cloud Pond that I skipped for instead opting for the AMC Gorman Lodge and told them my entire story. They said also Eddie came in yesterday but left right away to get back to work. I have Eddie’s number as he lives close to the AT and wants to meet me to have a beer and dinner together. I look forward to seeing him again. I needed a full day off and decided for two nights at the Lake Shore Restaurant and Hostel, the same place I started this adventure sitting on the dock having dinner with others overlooking Lake Hebron and watching the sun set. This time I sat there listening to a two person band playing great music mix of classic rock, bluegrass and R&B while drinking a glass of wine. When the music stopped I decided to sit in a chair on the dock to call Marilee and tell her I missed her and love her.","Antlers Camgrounp

WEATHER OR KNOT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599895,"Kennebec River to Carrabassett Valley
Distance: 37 miles
Dates: August 6 to August 9
 
After a restful day off it was time to continue. Today would begin with the Kennebec River. It was a much larger than expected river more in size with the Mississippi River that flowed through Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The river is clear and clean able to see right to the bottom. You must use a boat to cross where a paid professional wilderness guide took you across in a canoe. He described the history of the river right back to the American Revolution pointing out where the plaque was indicating the location Benedict Arnold portaged up river to Quebec during the Revolutionary War, and the history of the native Indians trade routes with European Fur trappers.  After a short ride off I was hiking to my destination for the day of Pierce Pond. A easy hike following a mountain river with waterfalls all along the way. As I neared Pierce Pond I somehow got off trail turning on a man-made small wood pole bridge that crossed the river. As I crossed I started to remember the map not indicating I was to cross the river so I stopped and started referencing my GPS. Suddenly a small dog was standing at my feet and wagging his tail so I leaned down to give him a rub. As I stood back up a man was crossing the same foot bridge and was startled to see me there. I told him I as lost and he indicated I could go back over the bridge and I would reach Pierce Pond in 30 minutes or simply follow the blue blaze trail I was now standing by and get there in five. I opted for the 5 minute route. He said he owned the lodge / fishing camp just 50 more feet down the bridge and offered me a glass of lemonade to which I also opted for the lemonade and followed him and “Charlie” his dog. There laid a huge old log cabin style lodge with about eight individual cabins along the riverfront. We sat for about an hour talking. He has owned this place for 33 years now and primarily there for fishing, showing me the lodge wall with huge brook trout mounted on it that were caught in that very river. He was Tim Harrison and this was the Harrison Fishing Camp and Cabins. I moved outside along the river sitting on a huge porch where a half dozen hummingbird feeders hung. Sitting quietly dozens of hummingbirds appeared competing for the nectar. Charlie his dog sat at my feet as I rubbed his belly. After exploring his cabins and great room in the lodge where I took a picture with the bear rug, I departed for the Pierce Pond Shelter. Just like Antlers Campsite, the shelter sat right on the shore of yet another huge beautiful wilderness lake, loons, bullfrogs and all. As the afternoon progresses, more hikers arrived filling up the shelter area. Many of us decided to swim in the lake and get cleaned up. We sat on the rocks watching the sun set over the mountains beyond the lake. Yet another perfect night in another perfect camping spot. On the wall of the shelter was a sign that Tim’s place serve up a monster breakfast including American Red White and Blue pancakes, eggs, sausage, milk, juice and coffee for $13. Six of us decided that sounded great and walked back to Tim’s place to let him know we were coming.  That next morning we were treated to a breakfast he bragged about including 12 pancakes with fresh picked blueberries, raspberries and apples topped with powdered sugar (….Red, White and Blue). Few of us could finish and the remains he put in sandwich bags for us to take. What a meal and what a place. Thanks Tim.
This day was not seen to be much climbing so I decided to try a 16 miler to get to East Flagstaff lake camp area. The book described tow campsites along the lake shore on sandy beach complete with two fire rings and tent pads for 9. Somehow I missed those campgrounds ending up on the southern tip and a road lined with small cabins. It was now 6p, and it had been raining on me for the last hour. I was wet, frustrated, exhausted and hungry. One cabin front door was open and a truck in front. I decided to ask questions to I knocked but no one answered. I stood there in the rain trying to contemplate plan B, where to set up the tent and sleep for the night. I was in no mood to do so soaking wet and standing in rain when a couple approached. They indicated they were not sure where these campsites were but by looking at my map felt I somehow passed it several miles back. The offered the next shelter was about 4 miles up. Neither option was in my plan as I just wanted to get that pack off and sit down. They told me then finally drove me about ½ mile to where the trail crossed another small campsite (more like a gravel parking lot) but that would do for the night. By the time I set up the rain stopped and I cooked dinner, crawled into bed and called it a night. I awoke to everything wet and I was frustrated. I remember another hiker in the 100 mile Wilderness called the Hostel of Maine somewhere around here. I was too tired, too frustrated and too worn down to begin yet another day of brutal climbs and descends and opted to find this hostel which I did, and from where I am now completing my journal. It is located at the very base of Sugarloaf Mountain Ski resort, a resort I have known about all my life from skiing myself. Now I get to sleep at it. 
 
I will head out tomorrow headed for Rangeley Maine over the next four days and hopefully find a computer to keep you posted.

CARRABASSETT VALLEY to BETHEL MAINE
 
88 miles
 
Dates:  10 August to 20 August 2018
 
Epiphany Two:
 
Woke up to a beautiful day with sunshine, low humidity, cool temps, clear skies and no rain in the forecast. The first climb would be yet another monster with two climbs in the plan for the day. The first took me up behind Sugarloaf Mountain nearly 4000 feet followed by a steep rugged descent then a second climb again back to 4000 feet on the back side of Sugarloaf Mountain. When I reached the top I mentally swore that I would hunt down those that thought this would be a great route – the only thing it is was brutal.  I found a short side trail that led me to the top of Sugarloaf around 4200 feet. As I reached the summit, the trees gave way to a large rock expanse with a view that was nothing short of stunning.  A 360 degree view where I could still make out White Cap Mountain and Chair Back Mountain in the Hundred Mile wilderness to the North East and the White Mountains to the west. Below laid Carrabassett Valley covered in trees and rivers, dotted with small towns all around.  It was impossible to determine what so far was the best view – this or White Cap mountain. In any case I was happy I made the short side trip.
 
It was cool on the verge of cold with a strong northerly wind whipping across the top.  I wanted to stop for lunch while enjoying the view and saw several very small buildings in support of the two large Antenna’s on the top of the summit so I headed for the leeward side of the larger structure where I came across a family of four (mom, dad, son and daughter) also resting out of the wind. They were doing a day hike with their son who was home from the Coast Guard Academy, living close by in Maine there.  As we talked I asked them what is that tall peak on the horizon to the west. Mom told me is was Mount Washington and the others were the peaks of the Presidential Range.  A sense of accomplishment and motivation came over me as I could see my next big section including a location I always wanted to visit, the windiest spot on planet earth. We decided to take the side trail back to the AT (Appalachian Trail) just a quick hike down the trail. They turned right to connect with a gravel road where they parked their car and I left to the next shelter for the night. 
 
The next several days were pretty boring and for the most part I stayed to myself even at the shelters. I finally reached a Maine State Highway that was nine miles south of the town of Rangeley. By guide  book showed that just a quarter mile up the road was a hostel named “The Hiker Hut”. By this point all I could think of is food so I opted first to bypass the hostel and hitch a ride into Rangley. The town was a beautiful as it was quant. All I could think of was the small New England town in the TV Series, “The Bob Newhart Show”. The town had all of the New England charm I envisioned growing up with large old Colonial structures dating back to the early days of America. The town sat right on a large wilderness lake dotted with small boats and signs of local regatta’s of days past. Food drove me to the Parkside Café and Pub on the lake shore.  When I entered I asked the hostess for an outside seat as I knew that I was stinky and dirty, and she laughed telling me to not sorry.  I stuffed my face with the largest burger with double cheese, bacon, and all the toppings, a bowl of their New England Clam Chowder, a side salad and dessert – oh and one of those large glasses of a local brew. I was now happy. As I ate several other customers chatted with me asking me about my adventures to date.  We had great conversations, well other than taking about the New England Patriots as the start of football was in progress. I let them know that there was only one team for me and that was my Minnesota Vikings. Several of us shook hands as I left heading back down the road to the Hiker Hostel. 
 
I began hiking out of town looking at my GPS for the best way back to the highway. Something inside me told me I was lost so I approached two local women (a mother and daughter) walking on the sidewalk across the street for help. They informed me I was going the wrong way then insisted  I follow them back to their house as they were already in the process of calling dad to drive me back.  This is the Americana I loved, small town America with great values and open hearts.  When dad dropped me off I tried to give him some cash to take his family to a local outdoor ice cream shop on me at one of the beaches in town but he simply refused no matter how hard I tried. 
 
This stop would be my second epiphany of my journey. The hostel was tucked away into the woods and off the highway. The gravel road leading in was lined with all kinds of stunning flowers (both botted and planted) and small square hanging flags on a long string hung between tress with Indian writings on them, much like the flags you see lining the sites around Nepal for the climbers of Mount Everest. Next to the flags were pitchers and old bottles with more Indian or Oriental character. I got to the entrance of the hostel where a small bell hung with a sign to please rind to inform them of my arrival. I saw a campfire in progress with several people enjoying popcorn and talking. Off to my left was small wooden shelter with a open front only covered by netting overlooking a large bubbling stream right in front of the building. Inside there was a queen size bed and mattress. It appeared to be empty and all I could think is if how lucky I could be if I could get that to sleep in. A woman named Pam approached indicating that sleeping structure was one of the private ones and available. I was in heaven. After dropping my pack off in my structure I joined the others around the campfire. A young woman on my left had a chipmunk sitting on her hand. She was the niece of the owner and told me that for years the chipmunks had become comfortable with people. One jumped onto my hand as I put it out then onto my leg and just sat there like a puppy dog. I was amazed.  He then jumped off scrambling around looking for food. She gave me some pistachios and told me to put them back on my knee. When I did the chipmunk jumped back on my lap and entertained me as it filled up its cheeks with seeks, then scramble off to store them for winter only to return again a few minutes later. This I let repeat for about an hour.
 
As we sat there chatting by the campfire, I also met Steve, the owner of the Hiker Hut. Steve was a quiet yet approachable individual that I sensed love his place. He indicated that he preferred hikers that wanted time to reflect and relax rather than the typical group of hikers coming in fast and leaving even faster to keep on hiking. Steve has operated this hostel for over twenty years and also lived there. This was him home. As it turned out Steve was a world class professional athlete that specialized in both triathlons and marathons. He had lived the life of charm, fame, fortune and excitement most would expect athletes of that caliber would enjoy, but Steve and Pam told me a much deeper story.  Steve was competing in an international event but failed to make the final qualifier. This was two decades ago and was the start of his epiphany they shared with me. Steve was very depressed for a long time as an athlete looking for something to define him that competition did not. He sensed he needed a higher purpose. He decided to stay in India and travel around for a few days until the competition was over rather than travelling back after his loss. He came across a family with two new infants, both who contracted a terrible disease that would define them for life of misery and isolation. The family and the country were not capable of helping those children as the care needed was not available.  It was his turning point in his life. Steve decided to give up professional sports and would spend the next 20 plus years bringing in doctors, medical care and support to these and other families where poverty had left them behind. Steve exchanged a life of charm for one of simplicity running this hostel. Every penny he earned he used to keep the hostel running and allow him and Pam to come back every year since first meeting the family opting instead to spend all the money on them instead of himself. They would close down the hostel for the winter, travel back to India and stay with those families bringing with them the care those children needed. 
 
As Steve talked he would bring out pictures of the two children over the years growing up. I could tell by his voice his love for them and happiness he was getting from helping them.  There was no doubt that Steve’s epiphany was his lost race that would change who he was. There was no doubt Steve was at peace with himself. I am not implying we should all give up the life we have to find peace. Instead all I could think of was that 28 year old Jessica at Baxter State Park, the one I prejudged who suggested I would find answers I am seeking because they were and are always right in front of me, and that all I needed to do was just open my eyes to see them, and just like Steve I hope my epiphany will become as obvious as his. 
 
After one of the best night’s sleep in three weeks to the sound of a bubbling stream, loons in the distance and chipmunks running amuck, I departed the Hiker Hut to continue my journey. I intended to continue to Gorham before my next stop off the trail. That night at the Sabbath Day Shelter I looked up to see Sam (Treefall now Tree Breaker) looking at me. It was great to again come across the two brothers I met so early in my journey.  Jake (Firefly came in about an hour later as he again decided to go fishing at a campground about four miles back. He caught several large brook trout and decided to clean and cook them right there sharing the meal with another camper there.  Jake told me he had tipped the canoe he found in the woods over in the lake laughing about it as he stated he never before tipped over a boat. They had planning for three long hikes as their parents were coming to visit and check up on them. I knew they wanted to have me stay with them but I knew that those kinds of miles were more than I cared for and more importantly would bring me to Gorham far too yearly as my AMC Hut dates in the White Mountains were now reserved and set in stone. As we left the shelter I again said goodbye to the two brothers from Geogia. About four miles after leaving I came across what was now a tie for first place for best views called Height of Land. The AT came out on a paved Maine Highway far above a huge (tens of thousands of acres) expanse of land filled with wilderness lakes, mountains and forest solid green in color. The highway had a pullover lot lined with informational signs all around talking about the wildlife, lakes, etc. As I knew that the Maine border was just ahead, this would be the last awesome view of Maine I have seen along the AT.
 
Two days later I realized that I was still far outpacing the plan and if I continued I would reach Gorham nearly a week early.  There were simply not enough shelters left between me and Gorham to slow down and the thought of staying at each shelter for a couple of days was not in my plans.  I opted to get off on yet another Maine highway crossing the AT and hitched a ride into the town of Bethel Maine, about a twenty minute drive south of the trail. The driver was a local and knew the area and hikers well. He offered, and I accepted a quick stop at a Walmart to resupply near the town of Rumsford. As we were leaving I saw Paul Bunyan and his ox BLUE standing tall (very tall) next to a local information stop. I got the drive to stop so I cold get a picture and accuse the people inside the information building that they stole “OUR” mascot. Apparently they were very familiar with the Minnesota version of these two icons and before I could say anything more they handed me an already printed sheet with the story of Paul and Blue which explained that Paul lived in Maine in his younger years but as he grew along with Blue and several other oxen that Maine was no longer big enough to care for him and moved him to Minnesota. We both laughed and shook hands.
 
The driver dropped me off in the center of the small town of Bethel by a grocery store. He told me about a campground just on the edge of town along the banks of the Androscoggin River just a few minute walk from town. That was my goal to stop for a few days to relax and kill time before heading to Gorham and the White Mountains. The history of the town was written in the buildings all around me. Old Colonial structures even a couple of old historic wooden covered bridges. I saw a large clock perched in the center of the town square and was amazed to see the date in it – 1796. This was in fact one of the birthplaces of America, just twenty years after the American Revolution with the vote to become the United States of America. I visualized what life must have been like back then, the struggles and success of people leaving tyranny to begin a life in a place they never knew existed. Just like the town, the people were as Americana as the town with flags flying on just about everything and small store owners peddling their wares on sidewalks in front of their shops.
 
After getting some basics, I headed for the Bethel Outdoor Center just across the river bridge where I would spend the next three nights. For dinner that night I walked north on the road about two hundred yards as a small English Pub and B&B. They only served English / Irish and Scottish beer and the one I had was awesome, as was the food. Each morning I would walk back into town for breakfast at the Crossroads Café. For lunch I walked north on the road about a quarter mile where a small store  had set up an outdoor BBQ stop with the smell of the food smoking for hours finding its way back to the campground. It was well worth the short hike.  I also found a small salon to get my hair cut and beard trimmed to look and feel a little more presentable. I hate the feeling of hair sticking into my lips as I try to eat. At breakfast I ran into someone I had not seen since Franklin Tennessee in 2016 when I was northbound.  Her trail name was Miss Janet and she is the unofficial queen and organizer of the Trail Angel concept.  She was travelling up the trail in support of the hikers. She actually remembered me, well not actually, she remembered Riley with the blanket coat I got him he was wearing around town that day. We talked and reminisced about the 2016 hiking season. She was with several other prior AT hikers now trail angels, Hog Driver, Sherpa, and Trail Mom.
 
 
Today is spending time at the Bethel library updating this journal. Then this afternoon a four hour tube float down the river supported by the campground. I will be part of a larger group and look forward to meeting them. I have been told a restaurant by the campground has a fantastic Hot Meatball Sub and that sounds like my name is written all over it. Tomorrow brings reality back to the journey as I will say goodbye to Bethel Maine.","Carrabassett Valley

BETHEL MAINE to NORTH WOODSTOCK NEW HAMSHIRE (The White Mountains)
 
  
123 miles
 
  
Dates:  10 August to 20 August to September 3 2018
 
 
The White Mountains of New Hampshire
 
 
I said goodbye to Maine who replied back with a last one-two punch of 4000+ foot Old Spec Mountain followed a mile or so later with the Mahoosic Notch before crossing the border into New Hampshire.  The notch itself was an ancient riverbed composed of huge boulders, most the size of a pickup truck. It was more slow and tiring rather than brutal. You had to remove your pack, throw it on top, shimmy yourself to the top, drop the pack then slide down the other side. This repeated for just over a mile taking me about two and half hours to complete. As much as Maine was beautiful especially the 100 mile wilderness I was glad to move on. 
 
 
I met a retired couple, Jon and Sharon at the Bethel Campground who were living their retirement dream of travelling around the country in one of those bus-like motor homes. They worked the Bethel campground under a work for stay program giving them a free campsite with all of the hook ups in exchange for working just two short days a week. On their off days they would travel around the region much like Marilee and I did on our adventure around the country back in 2013. Jon just completed a 19 hour hike over the peaks of the entire White Mountain Presidential Range sharing his stories and experience with me.  He drove me directly to the Gorham Post Office so I could begin my plans moving through from hut to hut without any camping or cooking gear.  After the post office I strolled around the town coming to a large set of ball fields / city park where a local farmers market was in progress.  Everyone knew everyone by first name, talking about their children and families, weather etc. I decided to get a large tomato and quart of strawberries. The first bite reminded me of the days when my mom would go to the local grocery store in the fall getting right from the vine fruits and veggies at the peak of ripeness. It had been decades to taste so favorable tomato and strawberries so I sat there in the park finishing them off then getting more. I talked to another vendor who was spinning Alpaca hair into knitting wool for sale. She was using the old fashion type of spinning wheel like you see in old medieval movies other than this was new and made from layers of bonded wood into a beautiful piece of art as much as it was a tool.  After, I headed over to the hostel where I came across the two Georgia brothers. They just completed a slack pack hike backwards from Pinkam Notch to the hostel, a 21 mile hike that took them nearly 15 hours to complete. The next morning they would be departing, after taking a couple days rest. I knew then this would be the last time we would cross paths on the trails as at best I would be four days behind and losing more each day. They would be doing longer hikes each day than I. 
 
 
My plan to hike the entire White Mountains using the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) hut system would limit me to around a nine to a ten mile a day average over the next week and half. My last night at the hostel was a relaxed evening including sitting around a campfire sipping water to begin my water loading strategy to stay hydrated. A 30 something woman working at the hostel sat close by and I could see she was crying. She realized I noticed and apologized profusely so I knew she needed someone to talk to. She told me her dog of 11 years had just died that week and was buried there in the woods of the hostel.  She shared pictures and stories of her dog and it was apparent how special that dog was to her and how she missed him terribly. We sat and chatted for a couple of hours and I could only hope that I was some comfort to her. At daybreak I would depart for the AMC Crawford Notch Hut. A final check of my pack now showed that I was only carrying 18 pounds including water rather than the 35 before.
 
 
I reached the AMC Crawford Notch 3300 feet up the mountain by mid-day with hours to spare before dinner.  The main portion was an old yet beautiful wooden and boulder structure dating back to the early nineties. The sleeping area was two separate structures with nearly fifty bunks for hikers separated into 8 rooms each holding various number of bunks. As more guest arrived it quickly became apparent these hikers would be very different than the AT hikers I have spent the last month and half with. Most were there with their families. As more guest arrived I could see most knew each other and many have been doing this every year going back generations. 
 
 
I connected with two families from New York City who asked me to join them as they explored the mountain side before dinner. They have known each other a long time, living close to each other and their children attending the same schools. We first went to the “Ice Cave” a large opening in the mountain side. As you approached you could feel the cold air rushing out. Inside remnants of ice were still below the large rocks. In the old days this cave was used by hut staff to keep food cold. We crossed through a short field of raspberries to eat and let the children pick them.  Next we headed for the “Ramparts”. This was an area of hundreds of acres of monster size boulder and slabs of rock the size of multi-stories buildings.  The mountainside collapsed hundreds of years ago when huge rain storms weaken the mountain. The children were jumping from rock to rock as the adults sat on top to admire the views of the mountains around us. At six the hut staff came out and began singing loudly a song indicating dinner was ready. I sat at the same table with the two families and others beginning a great experience of understanding the people who come to the Whites year after year. There was clear sense of family and friendship that would repeat itself at every other hut. The staffs were all college graduates who have come back for years to work this job.  They were bright and strong as they told us twice a week they would climb the mountain with nearly a hundred pounds of supplies and food on their backs to feed us. They would entertain us as we ate including skits for the kids. The food was amazing and plentiful. I knew right then my decision to use the huts was going to make the White Mountains a positive experience. After dinner we got the current weather information hearing winds were already gusting 30-40 miles an hour with forecast for overnight winds ranging 60 to 80 mph. Then staff began a series of presentations you could choose to participate in, most around the life of the mountains, etc. By 8:30 it was getting dark and as I was both stuffed and exhausted so I headed for bed. 
 
 
The next morning I awoke to staff reciting poetry outside of our rooms. At 7am staff again loudly sang breakfast was ready. Like the night before, breakfast was awesome. Today I would head next to the Mount Madison Hut 13 miles away and over 5000 feet in elevation to the top of the mountain. It would also be one day I will never forget. It started with a brutal steep climb over Wildcat Mountain including a death defying descent into Pinkam Notch. I reached the Osgood Campsite at 2200 feet around 2:30 pm along the AT. The sign showed I had three more miles to make the hut. I took a water / lunch break as other AT hikers there told me the next two miles were nearly straight up on boulder fields. I mentally planned I should make it around 4:30 to 5pm well before dinner time. It took me till 5pm just to reach the alpine zone at 4800 feet now devoid of any life and just a barren mountain top composed of huge boulder and slabs of rock. Winds picked up, and later I would find out wind gust of 93 mph while I was actually outside trying to get to the Madison Hut. I literally could not stand up as the wind was doing its best to blow me right off the mountain. I sat down next to a large cairn of rocks indicating the AT Trail as the white stripes on rocks were worn away by years of brutal winds. I was fearful and deciding if I should get below tree line or keep going. The problem was I had no tent; sleeping bag or food and getting down the mountain would take hours well past dark. As I muddled the options I looked up to see a young woman northbound on the AT descending the peak on her hands and feet. She was headed right for me. When we met she told me her trail name was Giggles. She was wondering I was stopped telling me I needed to keep going using my hands and feet only and not stand up. I already knew that but was hoping the winds could subside for a while. We parted as I watched her continue to hike to below tree line and knew I had only one safe option – hike on my hands and knees so  I put my poles away and began what would be a brutal and terrifying one mile hike that would take almost three hours to get there. By 7pm my GPS told me I had another quarter of mile to go. Ahead laid a large set of boulders I needed to scramble over.  I took my pack off and set it on top including my poles and began to shimmy up the side of a boulder 15 - 20 feet high. My butt accidently hit my poles and I helplessly watched them slide down the rock and go under another boulder. I needed those poles so I spend ten minutes trying to figure how to get to them.  Darkness was quickly setting in as the wind was also increasing. There about ten feet under a huge rack were my poles. There was not a chance in hell I was going to crawl under that boulder and with sky getting darker I accepted my poles were now owned by Mount Madison.   At 7:45 I reached the hut exhausted, hungry and shaking. All I wanted to do was sit and drink water.  Dinner was long over as I entered, yet staff met me to help me including bringing out dinner they saved for me. I was starving and ate everything they brought out.  By 8:30 I was in my bunk and asleep still in my hiking clothes and did not care. I would wake up during the night by the howling winds swirling around the mountain top. I did not sleep well as my legs cramped up all night long. I now knew what it must feel like being in a Category Two hurricane.
 
 
I awoke around 4:30 stressing about my poles. Hiking the exposed mountain tops without poles was insane. Breakfast came at 7 and I sat with several families who wanted to hear my story. I watched the hikers leaving after breakfast for Mount Washington getting buffeted by the still strong winds. My decision was made. I needed to go back down and get new poles. I talked to the hut staff asking if there was an easier shorter route down. They pointed out the Valley View trail about 4 miles long they use to carry those 100 pound backpacks of food up and down. The forecast for Mount Washington was overcast with good visibility during the day with late day thunderstorms and heavy rain after sunset. I was not going to miss Mount Washington but going down and getting back up the same day was impossible and the forecast was that the top to be in the clouds with rain and no visibility. Being a meteorologist I always wanted to stand on the windiest spot on planet earth, Mount Washington with a measured speed of 231mph back in the 1930s. I promised myself I would not allow the AT to dictate my adventure  like I did when I started in Georgia going northbound and skipped everything I wanted to experience to just keep up high daily mileage hikes.  So down the Valley View Trail and hitched a ride into town and the local outfitter, got new poles then called a ride service to pick me up to take me over the Mount Washington Cog Railroad at the base of the mountain. I got there just in time to board the last train ride up at 3:30 and by 4:30 I was standing on top of Mount Washington. I looked back at Mount Madison just a few miles north of me and accepted I would not hike those few short miles. I only had a short time to spend up there so first I stopped to take my picture at the summit marker. Then I headed to the museum where I listened to the recording of the meteorologist transmitting to the world as the wind speeds kept increasing over a few minutes from 140 to 231 mph that historic day. You could hear the excitement and disbelieve in their voice all while looking at the pictures on the walls of that  day from their building encased in a solid block of ice. Today that record still stands as the highest ever wind speed any human has ever experienced. In the 1950s an automated unmanned station recorded a higher speed on a remote Australian mountain during a hurricane. I had experienced history first hand. It was nearing 5pm and I had 1.4 miles and 800 feet to descend to reach my next hut, the Lake of the Clouds Hut just below the peak so off I went. I went from my worst day hiking the entire AT to what is now my best and the day was not over yet.
 
 
This hut was situated in the saddle overlooking both Mount Washington and the entire valley below. What a view. This hut also could house 70 people in a very modern facility. Like the other huts dinner was great. I was assigned a bunk with four beds that already had two girls in it. As I talked to them I came to realize there were still in high school, feeling a little awkward I asked if we could keep the door ajar to let air flow. Really I did not want to be sleeping with two high school girls alone.  After dinner we could see a thunderstorm to the far west forming with lighting in it moving towards us. Our view out the windows were still unlimited, yet within a minute we were actually in the thunderstorm. Visibility dropped to zero near instantly with violent rain swirling in the air, some go up, some going down and all swirling in all directions. The water droplets were the size of dimes, bigger than I had ever seen. Lighting with instant thunder rocked the complex.  I actually like thunderstorms so I put on my headphones and listened to music as the storm continued. I awoke to still heavy rains but the thunderstorm was gone. Visibility was literally zero outside. After breakfast the hut staff gave the weather forecast that the rain should stop and sky begin to clear later in the morning. I decided to sit and wait it out while others left in pouring rain and no visibility.  By eleven it was good enough and several of us ventured out at the same time including a group of four men that were also headed to the next Hut, Mizpah Hut. Strong winds were at our back making hiking easier. You could see down into the valley and skies were clearing yet through the mountain passes you could see the clouds actually form as they were pushed up, go ripping by us at over 60 mph, then descend and evaporate as they fell down the other side into the valley. We reached Mizpah in early afternoon. The four guys, Scott, Ken, Rick and Jack invited me to join them in some cheese, crackers and wine. They have been for years going on trips together all over the world and were here for a few days to climb some of the presidential peaks they have not completed in past years. Their goal was to get all 48 of the 4000+ summits in the White Mountains. 
 
 
The next morning I hiked out with three other men on a weekend expedition to Crawford Notch where their car was parked. There I ran into one of the families I met on the first day t Carter Dome Hut. Sanjay gave me a ride back to the AT trail after I said goodbye to the three I descended with. This day would be an easy hike on an old railroad bed level, and clean of rocks. I could move fast and got to the Zealand Falls hut by midafternoon and not tired.
 
 
Zealand Falls hut stood looking over a huge valley with a clear view of the mountains. Next to the hut was Zealand Falls, a beautiful cascading river that also was the only hut that derived electricity from a small hydroelectric dam. The last three days were perfect including the weather. I came to sit for dinner at a table from a family out of New York. They had two children, twins, with the girl named Hanna. She was very inquisitive about the AT hike. Her mother told me that Hanna, now 16 wants to hike the trail so I told her of my adventures. After dinner the presentation was about the plants that grew here. In front of the hut were raspberries to which the staff indicated the seeds were actually from mule poop when resupply was accomplished by mules carrying loads up the mountain.  I suddenly had the urge to brush my teeth. I awoke around 3am for a bio-break where the night cloudless sky gave an incredible view of the stars and planets.
 
 
Another wakeup call, this time one staff member playing a violin as she strolled the hut. After breakfast it was time to head off to the Galehead hut. The descent close to the hut was only eight tenths of a mile but was brutally steep and rocky. It took me almost two hours to navigate the trail down where I came across Hanna’s mom, Lisa again. She was sitting on a large boulder with an exhausted and dejected look on her. She asked another hiker how much farther and he stated about a mile. This was not what she wanted to hear. She saw me and asked if I knew so I pulled out my GPS and to our surprise we only had about 300 more yards to go. Again I was assigned a bunk, this time with five women from California on an REI sponsored trip. They all were friends living up from Sacramento near Lake Taos. We traded stories and conversations until dinnertime. At dinnertime I again sat with Dan, Lisa and the twins.
 
 
As morning came, I realized I had only one more night in a hut and just two days of hiking left before this was over. Greenleaf Hut was both theirs and mine final destination. It was a brutal day with another steep descends. I did not reach the hut until around 7pm, well after dinner started. I looked around the tables and only saw Dan. He was worried as Lisa was still out there and heavy fog with night fast approaching. About 15 minutes after I got in, both Lisa and Hanna who went out looking for her came in. Staff brought us both our dinners they saved and it was actually the best to date. As I was getting off the trail the next day, we agreed to hike down together. Dan and I hiked together talking and discussing physics as he is physics major practicing in that field. For me it was great as he could help me understand many of the concepts I wanted to know about. By noon we reached a trailhead parking lot in the state park.  They offered to drive me to the hostel I would stay that night and on the way took me out for lunch which of course would be the largest, greasiest, cheeseburger with bacon and fries. I was happy.
 
 
In hindsight using the hut system was an amazing experience. I got to understand their culture built on hundreds of years living in the birthplace of America, and in the places where farmers and shoemakers dropped their tools to defend and drive the British to defeat during the American Revolution. This was a place of history for them and it  was evident they were very proud of their heritage. These were the descendants of the first “minutemen” those citizens who became soldiers in a minute to create this country, that we now call the National Guard.
 
My next Epiphany!
 
 
Upon reaching the hostel I took a hot shower and got into clean clothes. Ordered some delivery Chinese food with other hikers then retired outside to sit by a campfire.
 
 
The first hiker that sat down was someone I had crossed several times over since July. He was about 30 years old and went by the trail name “Denim” because he always wore cotton jeans, a cotton shirt and a big cowboy hat. The first time I met him in that outfit I little confidence he would make it far. Cotton is a killer when wet or cold yet there he was. He came across as a drifter; most likely homeless and most likely everything he owned was in that backpack he carried. It was the first time I had a chance to actually talk with him. I was a little stunned to actually see him assuming he would have dropped off long ago, yet here he was. I was still judging him poorly, and assumed his life was filled with failures with no breaks. Yet as he talked, I became to admire this wanderer. It was clear to others of us Denim was truly a lost soul who had a rough life and hiking was his way of coping with his past. No matter what the conversation, while the rest of us were complaining about everything and every brutal climb. Demin always found something positive.  If we mentioned a specific spot, our stories were about pain and agony, yet he would recall in clear details the best of each of those locations, remembering every flower and animal he encountered. I was astounded to meet someone who had nothing and most likely a very hard life who could only see good, never once complaining or finding fault.  You could tell he cherished life and the opportunity to explore the mountains that seem to give him such comfort.  He was there hoping to get a work for stay bed for the night but the hostel was full. The owner came out and told him that if he was willing to hike four more miles, another hostel owner would hire him for a few days and pay him as well. All he could say was how lucky we was to know that someone was willing to hire him and give him a bed.  He left shaking each of our hands with such force and appreciation for knowing us and allowing him to sit with us by our fire. As he left, I quietly cried and asked god to take care of him because he earned that right. I hope god was listening as he disappeared into the night and hoped I would cross paths with him again. 
 
 
After Denim left, another hiker around 33 years old came in whose trail name was “The Traveler”.  He too had such a positive outlook on life. He quit a high paying job to the dismay of his parents. He stated that his parents were so concerned that they thought he was suicidal. He wanted to prove to himself that he could endure such a hike and actually was looking forward to the white mountains while the rest of us were happy it was over. He said that he had used the last 1700 miles to prepare himself for the upcoming onslaught to prove to himself that he was capable of enduring any obstacle, and the whites were the biggest on the AT. He went on to tell me that by the time he got to Pennsylvania, both of his parent not only supported him but flew out by  surprise to encourage him and give him some much needed time off the trail. They even brought his sister and other brother who flew in from around the county. As he spoke you could see how happy he was for what they did and how proud he felt of his accomplishments.  He was now only four weeks from completing the trail and you could hear in his crackling voice the emotions he was having as he found out his entire family will be waiting for him at Mount Katahdin in Maine and will hike up the final mountain with him. He hoped he could talk his brother in sometime joining him in another hike sometime. It was clear he knew he was loved and his family’s support was very important to him. My only regret would be I was not there to see that celebration and reunion.

NORTH WOODSTOCK NEW HAMPSHIRE to WOODSTOCK VERMONT (fall hiking New England States)

 

 

66.1 miles

 

 

Dates:  September 3rd to September 10th, 2018

 

 

New Hampshire into Vermont

 

 

After a night at the Notch Hostel in North Woodstock NH, I headed over to the Hiker Welcome Hostel in Glencliff NH. The owner of the Notch Hostel gave me a ride back to Kingsman Notch where the driver of the Welcome Hiker Hostel arrived taking may backpack in exchange for a small one so I could slack pack over the 4800 ‘ Mount Moosilakee arriving at his hostel that afternoon. The day started out great but by ten the weather changed with thunderstorms overhead raining on me. At first I was worried about being outside in lightning but then there was simply nowhere to go so I kept hiking. By 11am the rain had stopped and the winds shifted to the north blowing around 20-30 miles per hour and cooling off fast. By the time I reached the top I had stopped to put a hooded shirt under my rain coat as I was getting cold. Heavy fog hung over the mountain top as I entered the alpine zone on top void of any vegetation. So far the hike was great, especially knowing this was the last mountain of the whites, putting that behind me for good. It would take about 45 minutes to traverse the top of the mountain before descending back into the forest. With very low visibility I followed the cairns of rocks used as markers to show the path of the AT. After a few minutes the sound of distant thunder rolled across the sky. Another hiker close to me also stopped with that worried look on his face and we had to make a decision to either turn back and take shelter in the trees or hope that we could get across the top before the next storm rolled in. We both decided the second choice and I picked up my pace quite a bit. It was overall an enjoyable hike without much gains or loss but my wet hand began to go numb from the cold and it was hard to hold the poles.  I finally reached the other end and into the forest I went. After about another hour the sky began to clear and within 45 minutes I was under bright blue sunny skies, but still with a cold strong wind. Apparently a cold front passed overhead. By 3pm I reached the base and into the Welcome Hiker Hostel. At the hostel was the printed weather forecast for the next few days of sunny dry skies, highs in the low sixties and lows in the mid to upper 30s. Fall was definitely in the air today.

 

 

It took me two days to reach the small town of Lyme NH after crossing the Dartmouth Skiway, a private ski area dedicated to the students of Dartmouth College. The first night was just cold enough to make me use both my winter sleeping bag and my emergency down blanket that did a great job of keeping me warm.  I was planning to stop for the second night at the Cabin John Shelter just off of the Skiway but as I read my AT guide, it listed a small lodge in the town of Lyme just over 3 miles away that had an AT hiker rate with breakfast that sounded great, so down to the road I hiked and within 5 minutes a woman in her mid-40s in a blue pickup truck stopped and asked if I wanted a ride – which I accepted. I told her of my plans including stopping for dinner at any local restaurant. She was friendly and helpful suggesting and dropping me off at the Dowd’s Pub. After a beer and burger with all of the trimmings I headed another half mile to the Loch Lyme Lodge and Cabins located on a small and beautiful lake. When I got there, the owners greeted me but indicated they had no extra rooms of cabins as they had a wedding party that booked the entire place. Instead they offered me to use for free one cabin that needed a lot of work but was functional including power, hot shower and toilet. I would have to use my own sleeping bag. It was a deal that I could not pass up, so off I went among the wedding goers to my cabin, took a long shower, climbed into bed and off to sleep.

 

 

I slept in that morning until nearly 8, got packed up and headed back to the road. Again I got picked up within a few minutes by a young man also in a pickup truck that took me back to the trail head, but only after stopping to buy me a cup of coffee. Today would take me to the outskirts of Hanover NH, home to Dartmouth University. I spend the night in a shelter just outside of town, getting up early the next morning and heading into Hanover. The trail literally came out on the edges of the Dartmouth University soccer fields where children leagues were in progress. Many of the parents waved as I passed by, in amazement at the beauty of the area.

 

 

I decided to get breakfast at a local place called Lou’s. As I stood in line the couple ahead of me asked if I would like to join them. Tom and Jean were locals that frequented this place. They were telling me the history of this restaurant as I looked at the pictures on the wall. There framed were pictures of many presidential candidates from all of the past elections. They explained that New Hampshire is the first state to hold primaries and this restaurant is one of the most sought after places for candidates to start their campaigns at. Jean explained that the press would descend on the town prior to the primaries in hopes of filming and interviewing candidates at Lou’s. Even the waitress, who has been working there for 33 years came around to tell us stories of candidates over the years. After I heard the stories and saw the pictures, I realized that I have in fact seen this place on TV many times before.

 

 

As we talked another hiker by the trail name “Riverstrap” came in. I had seen him several other times over the last few weeks, so Tom and Jean invited him to join us. As we talked, it turns out that he and I are near neighbors. He lives in Loveland also. This was a pleasant surprise to both of us, exchanging information and promising to connect after we both complete the hike. He had just started his hike and would not be done until late year or early next year. We agreed we would talk more that night as we would both be headed to the same shelter. Tom and Jean insisted on buying us breakfast and telling them of our adventures on the trail. As we ended and departed, I headed to a small store for some resupply, then over to a barber for a quick trim and then to Northface to get a sleeveless fleece vest. Forecast for the night was upper 30s, and that was in town, not up another 2000’ in the mountains. The town was full of new students and parents as this was the weekend of school opening. It was fun to watch the hustle and bustle of students everywhere. I silently thanked Marilee for sending me my winter sleeping bag knowing it would come in very handy tonight.  I departed Hanover to cross the Connecticut River and into Norwich Vermont. Today was going to be a pleasant day, hiking along city streets and old neighborhoods for nearly six miles before I would reenter the woods. The last turn in Norwich would take me up a neighbor road full of old brick gorgeous homes lined with trees everywhere. Many of the homes had placed “Trail Angel” boxes in their driveways full of food, snacks and drinks. One even had two chairs to sit in and relax as we enjoyed their treats.

 

 

The hike to the next shelter was one of the best paths to date. No steep rocky climb, instead wide, dirt paths across farm lands and field filled with blackberries in bloom. Riverstrap and I stopped several times to eat blackberries. By five I reached the shelter and could already feel the cold in the air. By seven we had both ate dinner, set up for the night and crawled into our sleeping bags as the temps were falling fast. I had put on under my PJ’s my long undershirt and underwear, then my hooded shirt over the top. Even that was not enough as I was cold so I got up and got out the down blanket as well. In the morning, Forager Mike came into camp who I have connected with all the way back to Maine. He indicated that by Monday we were expected to get heavy rains. Riverstrap was able to get a signal from his phone and confirmed the forecast. Monday afternoon through Tuesday would be a washout as both an approaching cold front and what at the time was Tropical Storm Florence would converge over the eastern U.S. and drench us. This day would also be another amazing hiking day of great trails and great weather. As I hiked I began to devise bail out plans and share them with Riverstrap. Neither one of us had any intent of hiking or sleeping in shelters in such a storm. I had enough of those back in the 100 mile wilderness. We would hike to Thistle Hill shelter and finalize plans there. As we entered the small town of Pomfre, Vermont we came across a hostel in the making where the owner was cooking a large turkey over a campfire and invited us to join. There were several other AT hikers there who were working for stay and food helping him get the place fixed up. As I stuffed my face with turkey, the owner offered everyone to join him jumping off the bridge across the road into the nearby river below. I looked over to a 30 plus foot drop into clear waters seeing the bottom. The owner had marked a spot on the bridge where the river was so deep that he stated no one has ever touched the bottom including those that tried.  All I could think of was getting wet and cold so I let Riverstrap have all the fun while I watched. After food and fun, we left for the shelter. More of the same beautiful trail as yesterday passing through fields and farms on a nice trail.

 

 

When we got to the shelter, Riverstrap was able to download the latest weather from the National Weather Service. Tropical Storm Florence had transformed into a Category One Hurricane off the Carolina's’ coast and expected to make landfall within a day or so. He was also able to bring up a radar shot where I could see both the cold front approaching and the hurricane off the coast. The decision was made.  We would get up and hike to Highway 12 where the AT crossed it and head down into Woodstock Vermont. I found a hotel in my AT guide and he called to confirm reservations.  As I hiked this morning, I could feel the temperatures slowly dropping to the point I stopped to add a layer of clothes. My hands were getting cold and I had problems holding my poles. I exited the AT and followed a beautiful dirt road down into got to Woodstock lined with old colonial farms and building straight out of a postcard. The road was lined with small businesses selling everything from apples to maple syrup. At the end of the road was a very old cemetery lined with stones from the early American days of the revolution. In the cemetery were old headstones with dates of the 1700’s with several having American flags on them. Here before me most likely laid some of our forefathers that held and defeated British forces during the opening days of America. Along the way was a large old farm that belonged to the Rockefeller's. This is what I wanted from the AT and I was getting to see American history first hand.

 

 

 I got to Woodstock about an hour before him so I got breakfast and sent him a text I was in town and would be at the library where he could find me. By the time I finished breakfast he sent me a text he was in town as well. Across the street from me was Riverstrap sitting holding two bottles of local fresh chocolate milk, one for himself and one for me. We sat outside drinking the chocolate milk. I left him for a couple of minutes to go down the block where one of Paul Revere’s bells where hanging in an old church with the date of 1781. After we crossed the street so Riverstrap could get food and I headed to the library where I sit now. My journey so far has been everything I had hoped for and I feel good about my decision to return and finish the AT. 
 

 

As I look out the library window now I can see heavy rains have begun so I will close for now, find my raincoat and backpack cover and hike down the road for a well-deserved rest in a real bed with a real pillow and a real shower.","North Woodstock New Hamsphire

WEATHER OR KNOT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603297,"It is with great sadness I dedicate this chapter to my big sister Elaine. I reached Killington Vermont last Wednesday when I received word my sister while riding her bike was struck by a car on Sunday September 9th. She was airlifted to a Seattle Trauma Center where she laid for four days while the hospital and Redmond Police tried to identify her and notify family. As soon as I heard, I got off the trail to be with her along with my other sister Gail. We could see my sister Elaine was happy and at peace when she realized we were there as tears ran down her side. I knew she cold hear us as she blinked to questions and tried to talk to us. The accident was too damaging and Elaine passed away on Saturday, September 15th at 2:12 pm with her family and friends at her side.I promised Elaine that I would come back to finish this journey someday. Elaine was an amazing person and was a big factor in my life for my love of the outdoors and camping and hiking. I will miss her tremendously. Thanks you all for your support and understanding.","
