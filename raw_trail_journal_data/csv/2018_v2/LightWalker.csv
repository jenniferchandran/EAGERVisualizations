LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591235,"My friend Jimmy and I left central CT at 11:00 AM and arrived at Culver's Gap at 1:20. By 1:30 Iwas on the trail heading northbound on my 7 day AT adventure. The temperature was 75 degrees and sunny.
I passed about 50 young hikers along the way who were all part of an inner city hiking group. I wonder if it was sponsored by AMC. 
After 2 miles of hiking up to the top of the ridge I came to a fire tower. O climbed it And took a few pictures and video from the top. I swear I could see at least 50 miles in all directions. 
A half hour later I made it to the shelter arriving at 3:00 PM. Iwas the first one there. After putting my food in the brar box I wakes to a nearby stream, tooka bath in the cool run big water and put some dryclothes on. I filled up my water bottles and walked back to the shelter about 200 yards away. 
I made a clothes line out of a large branch, set my clothes out to dry and later out my sleeping mat and bag and explored the surrounding area. The site has a nice large bear box and modern privy. The cabin is about 60 hears old butthe roof looks fine. No rain forecast until morning. I made a hot cup of Chamomile tea to relax.
I made some beef stew for dinner followed by some cinnamon apple strudel for dessert. My clothes had fully dried and I packed them up in a dry sack.
I texted my family and friend Jim and called home to talk to them. Jim mowed my lawn which was a big help because itwas long overdue and kept raining every time I was able to mow it.The air was dry and the birds were busy chirping until just after sunset. I then retired to my sleeping bag. Despite all the bear warnings I managed to quickly fall asleep.","Culver Gap (US 206), MD
",Gren Anderson Shelter,"May 21, Mon",3.10
LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591236,"Day w started at 5:00 AM with the birds chirping away.  I tried to go back to sleep but could not. I got up at 5:30, made coffee, milk from powder and granola cerial. I packed up, put on my rain gear and left at 7:00 AM. It had just started raining and the forecasting called for rain all day. 
After hiking nearly 6 miles I finally met some thru hikers at the Mashapacong Shelter. Three guys and one lady were just leaving for a 16 mile hike northbound. I was hiking in sandals and did not even try to keep up with them. I only had 13 miles to hike. 
The rain stopped shortly after leaving that shelter and I was able to take my rain gear off forthe rest of the hike. It rained a little off and on butnotenough to get me soaked. 
I arrived at the High Point Shelter at 2:45 and was happy to see it was right next to a babbling brook and the bear box was adjacent to it. I was the first hike there and claimed my spot with my sleeping pad. 
After removing the rain soaked bandages from my blostered feet I washed them in the brook, dried them and put fresh badaides over the blisters. I then put on some dry wool sox and filtered some water.
The forecast calls for rain for another 2 hours and a chance of rain over night. Then it calls for no rain for the next 4 days. Tomorrow I might try to get 2 days of hiking done in one. That way I can be home by Saturday night and beat the rain forecasted for that evening and all day Sunday.
I did an hour of yoga and stretching to feel better, then read some of the hiker entries in the trail journal. A week ago one hike wrote that he got here jist before a big storm that dropped baseball size hail. That same storm reulted in 2 tornadoes in CT and 2 deaths. I'm glad I wasn't hiking then. 
A 59 year old thru hiker named Matt came to the shelter around 5:30 and will be staying the night. Yah. He retired last year and hopes to finish hiking the trail by late summer. It's really nice to have someone to talk to during dinner and after. 
Time for more herbal tea and sleep.","Gren Anderson Shelter
",High Point Shelter,"May 22, Tue",13.10
LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591237,"I woke up around 2:00 AM to the sound of thunder and rain, which lasted until 5:00 AM. We both got up around 5:45 to have coffee and breakfast. I used to like this dehydrared trail food. Now I'm ready to throw up. 
The trails are rain soaked bit the sun is supposed to come out by 8:00 and dry it up. Regardless, I'm sure to have soaked wet shoes and socks by the time I break for lunch.
Coming onto the main trail I met a retired thru hiker named Bob. We hiked together most of the day thru mostly dry trails with some long mud soaked sections that covered our shoes with mid and got our socks wet. 
We stopped for a half hour around noon to eat a lunch snack and change our sox. We then hiked across some old railroad tracks and some boardwalk thru a marshy area. Our shoes and sox got soaked again. 
He hiked with me for nearly 12 miles and got a ride to a hotel about a half hour from the next shelter. I had to fill e quarts of water at a spring there and hike uphill with it to the shelter. It added 6 lbs to my 34 lb pack for a total of r0 lbs. 
About 15 minutes later I arrived at the shelter. It was just before 3:00 PM and I was the first one there. I quickly changed into some dry clothes and sox and put all wet clothes and shoes on some rocks that were hot from being in the sun all day. About 2 hours later everything was dry. I spent some of that 2 hours setting up camp and doing some yoga and back stretches. I actually felt fine afterward. 
I made some herbal tea, ate some snacks and cooked some dehydrated beef stew for dinner. Jist when I was finishing up several hikers came to the shelter. By 7:00 there were about a dozen hikers and 2 dogs. Everyone but me and another guy opted to sleep in their tents. A good thing as I did not want to carry a tent with me this trip.
I'm hoping to hike 23,5 miles tomorrow so I can complete the hike a day early. Otherwise I may encounter some strong thunderstorms that are forecast for Saturday afternoon, night and all day Sunday. I have lots of snacks packed and think I can do it if I get an early start. Time to get some rest so I can wake up at 5:00 AM. Good night!","High Point Shelter
",Pochuck Shelter,"May 23, Wed",12.40
LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591239,"My prior 3 journal entries for this trip were written on the trail. This entry and the ones that follow were written about a week after getting off the trail, using my memory, pictures and AT Guide Book as a reference. I hope you enjoy reading them.

I woke up just before sunrise, ate breakfast, packed up and left Pochuck Shelter by 6:15. I was optimistic that I could complete the 23.5 miles of trail an hour or two before sunset and was feeling good physically and mentally. Unlike the prior two shelters, this one had a lot of tents around it. I’m guessing it was due to the streak of nice weather and a lot of section hikers hitting the trail.

About 1.5 miles into the hike I reached the summit of Pochuck mountain, elev. 1,195’. The views were nice and I took a brief break to re-hydrate. The flies and gnats were awake and required a head bandana and bug spray with deet to keep them at bay. Most of the trail was dry, but there were a few muddy sections that I had to carefully navigate around to keep my shoes from getting wet. I also hiked thru a half mile of trail that ran on top of an old railway, which had been deserted for over 100 years.

By 8:00 AM I had reached the valley floor and the start of three boardwalk walks. They add up to nearly a mile of boardwalk and include a suspension bridge that crossed over a small river. I took a few nice pictures of the walk and bridge. I also filmed myself going over the bridge. My 4 year young grandson is into trains and bridges and I knew he would enjoy that immensely.

By 9:00 AM I had finished the boardwalk section and began hiking back into the woods and up a steep rock climb at the base of Wawanda mountain. I them met a man named Bob that had done some hiking out west and was on a 6-7 hour day hike to get in shape to go out west again to hike in Wyoming. We hiked together for a while before he stopped for a break. About a 100 yards later I saw a large black bear about 40 yards ahead of me on the trail. It was standing up and looking at me. I reached for my camera and was about to take a picture when it moved off the trail. I somehow managed to get some good close up video of it, which I showed to hikers, family and friends later on.

I reached the Wawanda Shelter around 11:30 and stopped to rest, have a snack and filter water. The nearest water source was a ¼ mile away. I did not mind the 5 minute walk after taking off my backpack. I had reached the half way point for the day and was still feeling good physically and emotionally. I changed my socks and left the shelter around 12:30.

Most of the afternoon was spent hiking East in the hot late Spring sun. The trail went along a high rocky ridge most of the way to the next shelter. Despite the numerous small ups and downs I really liked this section. I crossed into NY and was feeling great! I to return to NJ some weekend to complete the 30 miles I missed in the southern part. The trail turned NE and views of the Hudson River / Valley came into view every half hour or so. The guide book said you could see the top of some NYC buildings, but I did not see them. A hiker that I met that evening said he saw them.

Late afternoon I came across a cold mountain stream, refilled my water bottle and took a 15 minute swim in a shallow pool. The cold water felt amazing on my hot feet and legs. I used a wash cloth to wash the salt and sweat off my head and upper body. I then changed into some dry clothes and got back on the trail about a half hour later. I had plenty of dried cranberries and other snacks to keep me going.

Late afternoon I came across a blue blazed trail that intersected the AT. According to the guide book I was just 6 miles away from the next shelter and had completed 18 miles. I texted my friend Jimmy to tell him about it. I then made the mistake of hiking a half mile down that trail before realizing it. I then had to turn around and hike back up hill, adding a full mile to my hike. Ugh! It must have been a combination of the heat and texting that got me disoriented. I had done lots of practice hikes on blue blazed trails and felt at home on it before realizing my mistake.

The next 4 miles were mostly downhill on flag terrain. Thank God! Around 7:00 PM I crossed a road and opted to hike a few 100 yards to a creamery to get some ice cream. It would give me a break and energy needed to hike the last 2 miles. The creamery was full of locals and I really enjoyed eating my “small” vanilla/chocolate swirl cup. A few locals asked me about my hike and were impressed by my mileage and hiking poles, which I swear by.

I started hiking the last 2 miles of trail around 7:30 PM and quickly met a retired hiker by the name of Old School. I hiked with him all the way to the shelter. Most of the hike was nice, but parts were up step rock ridges that were very dangerous to navigate. One small slip and I could have ended up at the bottom of a 30 foot ledge. We reached Wildcat Shelter around 8:30 PM, allowing us to get some water and setup our sleeping gear in the shelter. I cooked and ate a quick meal, but could not get to sleep until a few hours later. I was glad to have hiked 25 miles, my longest day total prior with a pack was just 16 miles. I now felt that I could complete the hike by Saturday afternoon, avoiding the thunder storms forecast for Sunday.","Pochuck Shelter
",Wildcat Shelter,"May 24, Thu",23.50
LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591240,"I woke up around 6:00 AM and was glad to find out I could stand up straight and walk around the shelter. I took my time making breakfast and chatted with Old School for a while. By the time I packed up and broke camp it was nearly 9:00 AM. With “only” 15 miles to hike that day, timing should not be an issue. It was sunny and going to be another hot day on the trail with temps in the mid-upper 80’s.

Today I kept the AT Guide book in the pouch on my hip belt, next to my camera so I could better gauge the distance remaining at every landmark and increase the odds of not getting onto the wrong trail. Nevertheless, I did manage to get off course at least once, adding a half mile to the hike. Other hikers I talked to said they had the same problem on the NY sections. Poor trail markings with lots of intersecting trails, resulting in them getting lost also.

Two miles into the hike I came to Fitzgerald Falls, a local swimming hold about a ¼ mile from a parking area. At a height of over 25’, the falls were all that the AT Guide book described and more. It was too early in the day to swim and I had a lot of distance to hike. I took a few pictures and video of the falls and resumed my hike.

Two miles later I reached Mombasha High Point, elev. 1,280’. This was a great spot to take my morning break because there was a view to the East and the breeze felt great on my hot sweaty body. Two miles later I reached the summit of Buchanen Mountain, elev. 1,142’. This was a good place to rest and have my lunch snack. Again the breeze felt great on my hot sweaty body.

An hour later I stopped for lunch and had to filter water because I had already consumed a quart. I was starting to feel fatigued from all the ups and downs and above average temperatures. By mid-afternoon I reached the scrub-oak covered 1,180’ summit of Arden Mountain, with limited views to the west and north. With approx. 5.5 miles left to hike, I pressed on.

Shortly thereafter I hike thru a part of Sterling Forrest State park. The trail here was nice and pine needled covered in several areas. I wish all trails were like this. My feet were very very happy. I short distance later I reached a viewpoint over a step 4/10 mile section of trail named “Agony Grind.” Up to this point I had no problems hiking downhill and was glad to be going down this steep juggernaut, vs. up. Near the bottom was a tail register box on a tree. I was too tired to sign it, but vowed to write the NY AT Trails Association a stern letter after I return to civilization.

Shortly thereafter I crossed over the Metro-North Port Jervis Line, followed by the NY State Thruway. Crossing the thruway felt nice. There was a strong breeze from all the traffic going under and no bugs on the bridge. A few Truckers honked their horns as I raise my poles skyward, which I assume is the Hiker salute to freedom. I got back on the trail after a ¼ mile walk along Old Arden Road.

About a mile later I reached the summit of Green Pond Mountain, elev. 1,180 feet. Time for another rest break and views to the west of the trail. Just over 3 miles left in today’s hike. You can do it!

About 2 miles later I came to a famous landmark call the Lemon Squeezer. I had heard about this before and have read about it in the guide book. The book describes it as “A famous, steep, and sometimes claustrophobia-inducing passage between boulders.” I took a few pictures before entering and started filming video. About 10’ into the passage it had narrowed to the point where I could no longer film, so I stopped. I then squeeze thru the last 10 feet and was glad to make it out the other end safely. Later that day at the shelter I learned that another hiker crushed his cell phone against the rocks there and had to buy a new one. About 10’ past this landmark was the steepest part of the trail that I have ever seen. It appeared to be a 20’ climb up nearly straight up. A bypass route around it had a sign that read “The Easy Way.”, so I took that instead. Trust me when I say it was no easy climb. I am almost certain that hard-core hikers with fresh legs and/or light packs take the hard way. Just 1.5 miles to go to camp!

The trail gradually went up hill for the next ¼ miles until I reached the summit of Island Pond Mountain, elev. 1,303’. The trail then dipped down a few hundred feet and back up to the summit of Surebridge mountain, elev. 1,200’. Just one more mile to go to the shelter!

A half mile later I crossed Surebridge Brook in the swampy hallow between Surebridge and Fingerboard mountains. I had read that this was the last water source before the shelter, so I drank the rest of my water, filtered a full quart and loaded up two more quarts of non-filtered water. The 3 quarts added about 6.6 lbs. to my pack, which felt like 10 lbs after a long hot 14.5 mile hike.

About a half mile later I reached Fingerboard Shelter, where I would be staying for the night. Like Wildcat Shelter the night before, this was a very old shelter that was built about 100 years ago. The original stonework and hand-hewn beams were still present, with a newer flooring and roof. I arrive around 7:30 PM, followed by 3-4 thru hikers that also stayed there overnight. I was very glad to have been able to complete the hike and have 1.5 hours of light to dry out my clothes, cook dinner and settle in for the night. Due to the warm evening air and heat from the shelter rocks I could not get to sleep until after 10:30. Regardless, I looked forward to completing my section hike the next day.","Wildcat Shelter
",Fingerboard Shelter,"May 25, Fri",14.70
LightWalker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591241,"I woke up just after 5:00 AM, had a quick breakfast and packed up. I managed to get on the trail by 6:00 AM, well before any of the other hikers. In addition to the 4 hikers in the shelter, I saw a dozen tents around it full of hikers that arrived the prior evening. I estimated the temperature to be a cool 60 degrees. I was looking forward to completing my section hike, getting home, taking a hot shower and seeing my family. At least that was the plan.
For the first half mile of the hike the trail stayed on a high grassy knoll. The grass fields seemed to extend for miles. I took a few good pictures of them, but pictures could not capture the beauty. After a half mile of uphill hiking I reached the summit of Fingerboard Mountain, elev. 1,328’. I knew I was there because there was a stone fireplace to the right of the trail, just where the guide book said it would be.

I soon came upon a huge water tank that appeared to hold enough water for a town of 10,000 people. It was surrounded by a chain link fence. I then crossed Arden Valley Road, followed by Tiorati Circle, a popular swimming and picnic area near the traffic circle.

About 5 miles into the hike I stopped at William Brien Memorial Shelter to rehydrate and rest. I had an upset stomach and could not eat any food for fear of throwing up. I attributed that to the swamp water that I drank the day before. Perhaps I should have treated it after filtering? Lesson learned!

I then proceeded downhill on the wrong trail for ¼ mile and had to hike back up in the hot 85 degree humid weather. I had to rest again at the shelter to catch my breath and prepare for the remaining 10 miles. I was very upset at a thru hiker who assured me that was the right trail. Lesson learned, don’t trust another hiker when it comes to directions nor distances. They are all liars!

After hiking a mile further, mostly up hill, I began to worse and decided that it was not a good idea to complete the remaining 8 miles. I called my friend Jimmy and left him a message asking him to come pick me up at the next road crossing. I estimate a 90% chance of completing the hike, but opted not to because I did not want to risk my condition getting worse in the middle of no-where and having to call in a rescue, which could have cost me $1,000’s. I could always hike that part of the trail another day.

About a mile later I had reached the Palisades Interstate Parkway. The trail went right across the road and I had to be careful not to get run over. I then saw a rest area about a half mile up the road and hiked to it. It was around 11:00 AM and I was very glad to see they sold cold coke in bottles. I drank a 16 oz. bottle right away and left Jimmy another VM and text message telling him where the rest area was.

Hours went by and there was no sign of Jim. His 11:15 text informed me that he had errands to run and could not leave town until 2:00 PM. I later learned that he did not leave town until 2:30 PM. Had he not gotten lost twice (due to GPS issues), he would have picked me up around 4:30. He finally rolled into the rest area around 6:00 PM. We drove two hikers from Germany to a nearby Walmart (to get a new phone) and proceeded to drive home.

I arrived home around 8:00 PM, took a hot shower, unpacked and threw my dirty clothes into the laundry machine. My family returned home shortly thereafter. I was very happy to greet them and was grateful to have hiked 80+ miles in approximately 5 days. During the hike I broke my single day record (25 miles), my two day record (40 miles) and my 5 day record (80 miles, 75 I, trail). I had lost 8 lbs (mostly water weight), dropping from 150 lbs to 142.I drank some light beer, ate toast and chicken soup that evening to speed up recovery. Within 24 hours I gained back 5 lbs and felt 90% recovered. I look forward to returning to Bear Mountain, NY someday to complete the remaining 7 miles in New York and back to NJ some weekend to complete the remaining 30 miles there. First I need to spend a few weekends with family and friends and prepare the house for the summer months ahead.","Fingerboard Shelter
