Babbling Bear and Gooseyman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580825,"I was Bhikkhu on my first thru hike attempt in 2007. I made it as far as Duncannon Pennsylvania where I was knocked off the trail by Lyme disease. I was Monk in 2008 on my second thru hike attempt and made it as far Port Clinton Pennsylvania, where, in some sort of bizarre instant replay, I was knocked off the trail again by Lyme disease. I was Goose and Gypsybear (my wife) in 2011 on my third thru hike attempt and we made it into the Smokies where we were knocked off the trail by Gypsybear's bad back. We restarted in Port Clinton so I could finally finish the trail, but Gypsybear's bad foot stopped her in Kent Connecticut and I continued on without her ( and not without a few tears) as far as Pinkham Notch New Hampshire, where being separated became too much for us. 330 miles left to go.
You would think all that would be enough, and for any sane person it would, but I can't let it go, for the trail feels like home to me and it's magical pull is too strong. So I'm heading back out to rehike the entire trail in sections this time with Babbling Bear (previously Gypsybear) joining me (now Gooseyman or just Goose for short) for part of this first section from Springer to maybe Damascus. I'll start at Springer by myself and she will join me at Davenport Gap, just past the Smokies. See you out there.",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Mon",0
Babbling Bear and Gooseyman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580899,"On my first thru hike attempts I often thought I was beating my head against a brick wall trying to hike to Maine. But in a perverse way, I secretly enjoyed the feeling, and was really having a blast. My main struggle, particularly on the '07 attempt, was a chronic illness I have, Crohn's disease, which was constantly causing weight loss and energy issues, and casting uncertainty on the success of my endeavor. And that was also part of the challenge I enjoyed. The trail is almost always hard when you are actually out there doing it, and it's sometimes only in retrospect that I see how much fun I was having. I'm looking forward to seeing all the other crazies I might meet next spring on the trail. See you out there.",,View Entry,"Nov 30, Thu",0
Babbling Bear and Gooseyman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580944,"There is something about writing the third entry that seems to make the upcoming journey seem more real. A declaration to the world that this is actually going to happen, come hell or high water. And even though I can't try a thru hike this time do to work commitments, and the fact that Babbling Bear's feet won't go that incredible distance, I still feel very blessed to have the opportunity to get back out on the trail and especially being able to do a part of it with her. Just thinking about being back on the top of Springer Mountain, heading north bound, with the entire trail stretched out in front of me, gives me a wonderful feeling of anticipation. And even though I can't do it all this year, I do hope to re-hike the whole thing again and eventually finish with the missing last 330 miles I have yet to hike. See you out there.",,View Entry,"Dec 02, Sat",0
Babbling Bear and Gooseyman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581346,"I've always been fascinated by the Why? question; the motivations people have that are strong enough to carry them the 2000 plus miles from Georgia to Maine. So, of course, I have to ask MYSELF why.Why would I want to endure all the endless hardships, the intense physical and emotional challenges, the sweat, the bugs, the heat and cold and exhaustion and the day to day repetitive grind that is life on the Trail. AGAIN!                                      If I'm honest with myself, I must admit that at least a good part of my motivation is fueled by Nostalgia. And, I've found, Nostalgia can be a dangerous thing. To paraphrase Norman MacLean - I am haunted by Trail. And strangely enough, my nostalgia is more for the hardships listed above (not, of course, an exhaustive list) than for the beauty, peace, and comradery of the trail, though I miss those too. But perhaps its not as strange as it appears, this nostalgia for the difficult. The challenges and hardships of life on the Trail, along with the constant exposure to the power and the beauty of the mountains and the forest, have a wonderful energizing effect on me. I become energized to the point where life becomes extremely vivid, I begin to find joy in the struggle, and the raw intensity of experience leaves me feeling completely and utterly alive. That is what I miss the most.",,View Entry,"Dec 20, Wed",0
Babbling Bear and Gooseyman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583006,"I'm in luck because of some schedule change at work I've managed to wrangle another precious week for our hike. Now I've got 8 full weeks to play with and reset our target to Grayson Highlands as Babbling Bear has a hankering to see the wild ponies. It's one of the most beautiful parts of the entire trail and so a fitting end for our section. And it gives me a satisfying 500 mile walk. Of course I know I'll want to keep going, but reality creeps in and we will have to go back to work. But I am hoping to section the entire trail, and section hiking does have its own merits. I've been a big admirer of those intrepid section hikers I've encountered who have spent many years of there lives whittling away at the trail one little bit at a time. I've come to the conclusion that section hiking the whole trail is in many ways more difficult than a thru hike. The dedication it takes is amazing. Some dedicate all their vacation time each year to knocking out just a hundred mile stretch or so. And some take as much as 20 years to complete the trail. And some of those sections are not particularly enticing to say the least. Some of the comments I read in the last north bound trail register in Pennsylvania were down right pollitcally incorrect. I personally can't picture walking the rocks of Pennsylvania on my holiday instead of lying  on the beach. And by the time you get your trail legs, its time to go home! But you don't have to worry about the time pressure of a Thru and you can pick the season you wish to hike in. And you don't get worn down to a nubbin by the time you reach Katahdin. So because of Babbling Bears bad foot and the fact that we don't like to be separated for any length of time, another thru hike attempt for me is now out of the question. I will definitely miss some aspects of the Thru experience. One of the things I absolutely loved about being on a Thru hike attempt was the ever increasing intensity of the experience and the sense that a Thru hike is much more the the sum of its parts. For me its only when I've walked around 200 hundred miles that this sensation really starts to build. And its only around the 500 mile mark that I've really gone down the rabbit hole. Its where for me, a really long distance hike is just beginning. So I'm highly motivated to make my sections as long as circumstances will allow. And hopefully this time Its 500 miles.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Fri",0
