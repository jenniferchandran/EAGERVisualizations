Got a little case of butterflies in my stomach the past few days , as my departure date gets closer . I'm excited and nervous ... I've done a few week long backpacking trips before , but nothing that compares to a thru-hike of the AT ! Looks like the weather is improving there , so that's a good sign ...","

Lotsaluck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589657,"Helping my brother Tim replace the screen on his screen room on his dock ... it's like the old ""Keystone Cops "" movies , only crazier ... delayed the start of my hike again ... was supposed to be on the trail tomorrow , but didn't realize it's my niece's college graduation ceremony on Saturday , May 12th ... of course I'll be staying for that ! Will be heading for thr trailhead within a few days after that ... I'll probably take Amtrak or Greyhound to get there ... didn't realize it's an 8 hour drive from Tim's house ... that's a lot to ask . We are having a great visit here in Florida !",,View Entry,"May 09, Wed",0

Lotsaluck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591110,"In a motel in Gainesville , Ga.    Had a real scary night in my tent at Gooch Mountain (shelter was full). It was a tough day on the trail ... got drenched twice , and got lost for a couple of hours when I saw a white blaze and thought it was leading me up an old forest service road. Ran into some fishermen who directed me to where the AT crossed the road , and got back on the trail. The scary part wasn't from any wildlife , or from the downpouring rain ... it was from the way my heart was acting ...had a very rapid heartbeat , then my heart would just stop and give 2 pounding beats ...it would go thru 8-10 series of stopping and two pounding beats , then go back to a rapid beat...it went on for hours , and I was afraid to go to sleep.I finally dozed off ,and it was a little better in the morning. I decided to get off the trail and find a motel and re-evaluate my hiking plans ... that's where I am now ... will spend another night here and call my doctor in the morning , and see what he recommends .","

Lotsaluck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591260,"Well ... I'm here in Gainesville , Ga. at a motel where hiker shuttle driver Ron Brown delivered me on Saturday. Rented a car , and am headed to visit some good friends in NC. This may be the end of my AT dream ... it rained pretty much non-stop the first 4 days on the trail , and hard as I tried , everything I was carrying got soaked . But the thing that took me off the trail was the issues I had with my heart ... I think I just over stressed myself and maybe overheated from wearing my rain gear. It scared the heck out of me. Feeling much better now . Maybe I will have a rest and get back on the trail , but it's doubtful . I met some great people on the trail and wish them well , as they continue their hikes. Will update my journal after visiting my friends and deciding what to do next ...","

Lotsaluck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592232,"It's been about a week and a half since I got off the trail and ended my hike . I am truly disappointed that my hike ended so early on ... after all the preparation and anticipation , it was a real letdown , to say the least. I did learn a couple of valuable lessons along the way . I knew my pack was heavy starting out , and that I had decided to carry some extra weight to allow me to be more comfortable in camp. I struggled with the weight constantly , and believe that's one of the factors that ended my hike. The AT is a strenuous hike , and the added weight really took a toll on my body. The other thing I would have done differently was my poor eating habits . I knew that it was important to consume a lot of calories in order to replenish the energy that was required to do such a strenuous hike. Although I only averaged about 8 and 1/2 miles a day , I was exhausted at the end of the day , and didn't make the effort to eat properly ... that was a serious mistake . I did make an effort to stay hydrated , but did run out of water once ... some of the water sources were farther from the trail than I expected , and the one time I ran out , I gave up looking for the water source and continued on ... not a smart choice. So ... there were several things I could have done better , that's for sure. The AT was more difficult than I expected ... lots of ups and downs . But it was alao beautiful ! The hardwood forests were even more beautiful than I had expected. The greenery that you walk through had a glow to it that I will never forget . The views were limited , but the forest was remarkable ... I loved it ! My adventure on the AT was cut very short due to my health , but I met some wonderful people along the trail and will always remember their kindness and friendship . I am so thankful for all the hard work that all the trail workers have done to make the AT such a remarkable place ... it's amazing , the effort that it takes to build and maintain the trail is obvious ... and impressive. Best of luck to all past , current and future AT hikers ...  you are an inspiration to us all .",,View Entry,"May 29, Tue",0
Lotsaluck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592260,"Just wanted to thank everyone who signed my guest book ... your inspiring words were so welcome . To my wife ,Bev ... without your support , I would not have even made the attempt to hike the AT. And my family and friends back in Montana , and elsewhere , were also very supportive ... thank you all so much !","

Lotsaluck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600130,"Hi ... it's been a couple of months since I got off the trail due to an irregular heartbeat. I've been through many tests , and am now taking a beta blocker to help regulate my erratic heartbeat. I am scheduled to see a cardiologist in early September , to see what's next in this process. I've thought a lot about the AT , and lately have been wondering if there will be a chance for me to make another attempt to hike the trail . I feel as if I have some unfinished business  there to attend to ...   Time will tell ... hopefully I'll get another chance . I would like to thank Ron Brown ,a well known AT hiker shuttle service , who came to my rescue AT Gooch Gap . Ron went above and beyond what was needed to help me that day , and I am forever grateful to him . I would highly recommend Ron to any hikers requiring transportation AT or near the southern end of the AT. And he's quite an entertaining guy , too ! Thanks again , Ron ... you're the best !","
