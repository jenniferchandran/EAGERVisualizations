Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524161,"In the late 60's I was in the 9th grade and living in Oregon. Then the dream after graduating from high school was to hike the PCT with my best friend. Unfortunately, at the start of the 10th grade I was living in Miami, FL where there was a distinct lack of hiking trails. High school, college, career and family absorbed most of the next 45 years but the dream of thru hiking a long trail never went away. Living in several southeastern states with the last 18 years in western North Carolina has provided for plenty of weekend hiking opportunities. It's helped to keep the dream alive. With retirement tracking in two years the next step is to thru hike the AT. So after 40+ years of dreaming in 2018 I'll finally make it a reality after a slight delay. Much to do and prepare for.","

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525357,"Last fall during a weekend AT hike I had my first experience with trail magic. A local church had an orange metal bear proof box filled with drinks, snacks and necessities just off the trail. Unexpected and it truly was magic. Fast forward to this past weekend. My wife and I packed the SUV and drove about 2.5 hours near Max Patch at a point where the AT crosses a dirt road. We set up our tables with snacks, drinks and we boiled hot dogs in a turkey fryer then waited for hikers. It wasn't long until the first north bounder came over the hill and for the next 5 hours we had fun talking with and making new friends. There was Stretch, Shrink, Bigfoot, Beast, Outlaw, King, Bearbait and Hanna Solo to name a few. All of them had started the trail between March 2-8th so I had three questions for them: what's the biggest mistake you've made, What did you put in your pack when you started that you wish you hadn't? and What do you wish you'd had in your pack from the beginning? I learned some valuable tips. Pack ear plugs, have some waterproof socks, hiking poles are essential, most packed too many clothes, most went too far too fast the first week, pack one pair of really thick socks to sleep in and it takes about two weeks to get your trail legs. I also learned hikers like hotdogs!! The experience was a blast.","

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531089,"After the kids moved along with their lives (sort of) I decided it was time to scale down on weight in the pack and bought a BA Seedhouse 1. Great tent for weekends but no room for bringing the gear inside to stay dry on longer hikes. Did some research and traded up to the BA Copper Spur 2. A bit more weight but between the interior and vestibule areas much more room for my 6'4"" body and keeping the equipment dry. Planning a 22 mile short section hike in a few weeks on a section of the AT going into Damascus and looking forward to checking it out. The tent is the last major item I needed (for now) as preparation continues. Looking forward to next steps with 23 months to go until Springer. If the next 23 months go like the last 60 years it'll be here in the blink of an eye. Need to keep moving....",,Have Tent Will Travel,"May 02, Mon",0
Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544202,"Finally was able to do a hike to try out some of the new warm weather gear (not the tent). Shuttled from Damascus to where the AT crosses Hwy 91 at Cross Mountain so about a 22 mile hike back to Damascus. The plan was to have an easy break in weekend but ""best laid plans"" and all that. Started about 3pm and got to Double Springs Shelter about 4:30pm with the intention of spending the night. Guess there was too much daylight left so after a short break I decided to kept going. Refilled my water from the spring at Low Gap, sat out most of a thunder storm (most) at McQueens Knob Shelter and finally made it to the Abington Gap Shelter about 9:15pm where I arrived to an empty shelter. Had a late dinner, laid down exhausted and even with the mice had a fair night of sleep. Took my time in the morning leaving the shelter at 8am and ran into my only hiker, Hamster Ball, about half way to Damascus. He's a south bounder that did the NY to Maine section in 2015 and started the NY to Georgia section in May. After another round of rain showers I made it into Damascus about 1pm. So what did I learn; my ego and my body are on different pages, my rain jacket and pack cover are great, butt rash develops quickly when its hot, you need more water than you think, I need a quieter sleeping pad(will likely go back to my Z pad), need to upgrade my pillow, all in my current real hiking time is about 2 miles per hour and purple big toe nails are colorful but not desirable. And last, you can get a great cheeseburger in Damascus.","Have Tent Will Travel

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548111,Couldn't let the long Labor Day weekend get away without an AT hike so decided to see what the area north of Neel's Gap was like. The weather was dry and cooler so I wasn't alone with many other day and weekend hikers taking to the AT. As it turned out dry was a key word. With many water sources indicated along the trail I took minimal water with the intention of refilling along the way. Oops! Turns out that every source between Neel's Gap and Tesnatee Gap was dry(was told it wasn't until Low Gap another 5-6 miles until there was water). At the Tesnatee Gap parking lot there were many hikers in need of water including a group of four incredible ladies from Georgia and Tennessee. With a lack of water a shuttle was called(Ron Brown is amazing!!) for a ride back to Neel's Gap so this hike was over after 8 miles. My lessons relearned from this hike are 1)don't believe everything you read and 2)when in doubt carry more water. Hard to believe it's now only 18 months until Springer....,"

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548975,"In getting ready for the AT thru hike I've been spending time on the treadmill and doing local hiking. I'm fortunate to live in a part of NC that puts me near some great areas to day hike. Within 60-90 minutes I can be in the Linville Gorge Wilderness Area, Wilson Creek(a wilderness study area), Pisgah National Forest, the Blue Ridge Parkway or a very local spot called River Bend Park. All of these provide great opportunities to stop feeling like a rat on the treadmill and actually feel the variations of a trail under my feet. A group from the Wilderness Ministry at our church went up to the BRP yesterday and did an easy 5 mile trail called the Boone Fork Loop. With temps in the low 70's combined with the beauty of a southern Appalachian forest it was an incredible time. It was a nice change of scenery. Treadmills are great for logging miles but they just aren't trail miles. I've also been trying to work in a couple trips each week to River Bend Park to do a five mile loop in the afternoons. I really enjoy this because I get to take my hiking buddy, Daisy. She's a beagle we bought last year as a puppy since why wife and I couldn't stand being empty nesters. She's really turned into a good little local trail hiker except for when the nose detects a squirrel then it's off to the races!One of the guys from church and I are planning a weekender in October to do 27 miles of the AT between Nantahala Outdoor Center and Fontana Dam. Looks like the section coming out of the NOC is an elevation ball buster so got to keep training. Pheriel","

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563426,"Was told recently by Old Soul that I haven't updated my journal in awhile.  I've been actively getting ready during the late fall and winter using the shuttle services offered out of Hot Springs and Damascus.  Gave me time to check out my winter gear which worked great!  Also attended the Appalachian Trail Institute in late March which is run by Warren Doyle.  He's done the AT 17 times and was able to enlighten us with some valuable tips about his experiences. I met some great section and thru hikers there with a couple young ladies heading to Georgia that weekend.  I reached out to them a couple weeks ago and unfortunately one of them had a bit of a challenge and is now wearing a boot (not the hiking kind) for a few weeks.  The other hiker, who has the trail name Old Soul, is doing great.  My wife and I drove over to Erwin last weekend to have lunch with her and to pick her brain.  If was great to spend time with her and to learn from her experiences.  The biggest thing that's happened to me is I've officially announced my retirement for March 31, 2018 after 38 years of doing the 8-5 thing.  That's 60 days later than my original date so I've change my hike strategy.  Will now start in Damascus on April 15th and head to Maine.  My wife will pick me up in Maine about September 1st then shuttle me back to Damascus so I can start toward Springer.  With my only appointment being Thanksgiving at Mom's that'll give me 2.5 months to finish.  What a great time to be hiking through the southern Appalachian Mountains!!  With all my equipment decisions behind me it's time to up the training with my training partner, Daisy.  Tax day 2018 will be here before I know it!",,View Entry,"May 06, Sat",0
Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576933,"It took me a while to set up with the new site so no entries in awhile.  Only a little over 6 months until the official start to the flip flop thru hike.  Per the title I made the decision to change my starting point a little further up the trail to get ahead of the NOBO surge.  My new starting point will be Daleville, VA.  This should get me far enough ahead of the bubble but I know the young guns (AKA young legs) won't be far behind.  I've done several extended weekend backpacking hikes on the AT mostly NOBO or SOBO out of Hot Springs and Damascus plus local hiking, walking and treadmilling (not sure that's a word).  Each backpacking hike I've continued to fine tune 'what to leave in or what to leave out' of the backpack.  Settled in on all my equipment and I'm now working on 'to cook or not to cook'.  Started trialing putting different 'just add water' foods in the Nalgene and seeing how the foods do after soaking for an hour or so.  It may not be hot but will give me a variety of foods that I can eat while on the trail if I decide to not cook.  So far so good.  Going to have to wean myself from the coffee habit which shouldn't be too hard since I only drink decaf...with sweetener....and flavoring.I want to give a congratulations and a shout out to one of my classmates from Warren Doyle's Appalachian Trail Institute that I attended the last week in March.  Old Soul (her trail name) started the AT NOBO April 1st and summited Katahdin last Wednesday finishing the journey in 5 months! It's inspirational for me as I prepare.The clock is ticking so got to keep pushing!","

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578043,"Just did a 3 day weekend AT hike NOBO through the GSMNP with a friend from church, Trainwreck.  Fortunately, he didn't live up to his trail name and we had a great weekend.  Cosby Knob shelter was closed due to aggressive bear activity so we had to unevenly break up our daily miles to make it to the remaining open shelters.  Day 1 started at Newfound Gap and ended about ten miles later at Pecks Corner. Not much in the way of views early on in the day due to the fog but the sun finally broke through and the scenery was incredible.  When we got to the shelter I was a little concerned with the full house but it quickly faded away.  The group was mostly an REI adventure trip (lead by Nokey) and their energy was refreshing.  Lots of fun and laughter.  That night, however, not so much.  Relearned (?) a valuable lesson...pack your ear plugs when you stay in a shelter!  We had a short day 2 only going 5 miles to Tri Corner so took our time getting breakfast and packing up.  Hiking the ridges along this section of the trail makes for some incredible views so we were in no hurry.  Made it to the shelter early afternoon so just hung out and took it easy with a couple hikers from the night before.  The shelter slowly filled and two of the hikers were trial runners.  Turns out they were the reason Cosby Knob was closed.  About 4 weeks ago they had a bear come into the shelter area and it kept approaching despite them yelling and throwing rocks.  Finally, the bear took a rock in the head at about 10' and it back off but only after trashing a couple tents.  Good call by the Park Service.  After a restless night accompanied by more snoring we set out early to make it the 16 miles to Davenport Gap.  Had some welcomed trail magic at the cross road when the husband of one of our Wisconsin bunkies from the night before drove me to my car.  Got to love those Cheeseheads!  Besides the ear plugs the other decision I made is the stove will be in the pack on my flip flop.  Partially rehydrated freeze dried meals may be nourishing but it's hard to get passed the crunchy and the cold. So, all in all we had a great hike.


I've got to give a shout out. Hurricane Irma did a number on the trail with 25-30 major trees down just on the section of trail we were on.  This doesn't include  the countless branches and the carpet of leaves that covered the trail.  Along the way we ran into Pete.  Pete is a 71 years young volunteer that was out clearing his section of the trail. Whether your a thru, section, weekend or day hiker we owe a great amount of thanks to the Pete's on the trail that make our experience as good as it is.  Pete, you rock.  Thanks for all you do.

The fine tuning of my equipment is completed....for now. Been lots of AT, local, road and treadmill miles in preparation that will continue until early April.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582420,"The training miles continue to rack up and the clock isn't slowing down as April 7th seems to be just down the street and around the corner.  My equipment choices have been finalized(unless I can figure out how to eliminate incremental weight) and the side benefit of the training is some weight loss on my non-pack side.  Weight is weight and my legs and lungs don't know the difference.  With these areas progressing now I'm looking more at food.  Been researching it for some time and have tried a variety of combinations on my various hikes.  I want to experiment more so I told my wife that 2-3 times a week now until I head out for the hike that I'm cooking our dinner....trail style.  She says ""OK"" but its one of those kinds of an ""OK"".  The deal is I can only use my cook set which means Pocket Rocket and a titanium pot.  Tonight's delicious meal was simple, Knorr Rice Sides Creamy Chicken, added a can of chicken and used olive oil instead of butter.  Bought it all from Walmart for less than $2(already had the olive oil). I've had it before so I knew it was good but I've never looked at the numbers....820 calories and 40 grams of protein! I'd say a pretty good trail meal both easy and nutritious.  So now I'll keep experimenting to give some variety to my meals to keep this aspect exciting....or at least not let it become routine when I'm on the trail.  I'll report back on any life altering food combinations.  The next two months should be fun!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583034,"It's always great to get off the road or treadmill and put in a few miles on the trail.  It's also great to live in a place where we have a 100+ miles of hiking trails within 90 miles of the house.  Spent part of my day at South Mountain State Park today enjoying a 9 miler in the drizzle which translated into having that part of the park to myself.  With only 49 days until I start my flip flop at this point every hike is a bit of a shake down to keep fine tuning on ""what to leave in, what to leave out"". Got a chance to try out my Zpack rain coat which worked as it should have with a little weight savings versus my Patagonia.  Not much else has changed in the pack so now I'll keep putting in the miles (and the torture stair step machine) and experimenting with meals.  Looking forward to doing the southern half of the GSMNP in early March with a friend from church.  This should be my final multi-night trip on the AT until I start in Daleville on April 7th.  And last, Chinese food which I love.  More specifically, fortune cookies.  Sometimes you get a fortune that really fits what's going on in your life and here's what the latest one said, ""Depend on your feet, you can climb the highest mountains"".  That's the plan.....at least the highest mountains on the east coast!!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583863,"My friend Train Wreck and I headed out to do a 4 day hike from Newfound Gap to Fontana. The Hike Inn was our shuttle service and Nancy called when we were about 45 minutes out to let us know the park service had closed US441 due to snow and ice on the roads. No shuttle to Newfound Gap so enter being flexible.  After a delay we decided to start at Fontana and hike to the NOC.  Not as far but a great section of the trail and still heading in the direction I'll be going on the flip flop. As this was my last shake down prior to my start I was pleased how all my equipment performed with no complaints.  The weather was not ideal for the first two days being overcast, windy and snowy but that's hiking.  After a chilly night tenting at Locust Cove Gap we were rewarded after two days waking up on our last day to bright sunshine.  We topped Cheoah Bald just at lunch time and took a long break on top enjoying the warm sunshine and the terrific views. As we headed essentially downhill from there we kept pushing with visions of a fat, juicy cheeseburger when we got to NOC and we were not disappointed.  Over the 2.5 days of southbound hiking we were heading into the leading edge of the Springer surge so past 30-35 NOBO's that started somewhere between February 20-26.  It was a great mix of 18 year olds to retirees, men and women, people from the mid-west, northeast, southeast and as far west as Montana.  The award for being the farthest from home goes to the gentleman from the Czech Republic with an honorable mention to the couple from Germany.

Now, with all my work duties and responsibilities delegated out it's time to close this chapter and start a new one.  My focus over the next week will be spending time with my family, finishing my ""honey-do"" list and to continue the constant tweaking of what's going in the pack.  Not sure that every ends.  And to my ""Hamily"" I just want say a sincere thanks for everything.","

Saturday morning weather was better than forecasted(imagine that!) so after a great Cracker Barrel breakfast we went to the trail crossing. After another emotional goodbye with my family I started off. Was only going to Fulhardt Shelter due to late start but the adrenaline was flowing and ended at Wilson Creek Shelter. One thru hiker, Chopsticks, was there bundled down in his bag. I set up my gear, ate dinner and went to bed. In the morning we woke up to a winter wonderland with about an inch of snow but the sun was shining! Took off about 8:30 for a beautiful hike that paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway most the day so some incredible views. Ended my day at Cove Mountain Shelter and was by myself. My two day total is 25 miles and I’m on schedule. During the night it started snowing again and as I’m typing this there are two inches on the ground and it’ll keep coming for another few hours.

Water was plentiful which is helpful so you don’t have to carry any extra water weight between sources. Met many new thru hikers: Bucky(she and I were gasping for oxygen up a steep climb), French Fry, Weatherman and Bill. Don’t think Bill is his trail name. Overall, today was good with a mix of uphill and downhill hiking. The long, steep uphills were butt busters and it was always nice to top a hill. My total fistance so far is just over 49 miles which is slightly ahead of schedule and I can tell you the miles have earned me the hiker funk!  More potent today than yesterday or maybe it’s just riper. Looking forward to being in Glasgow, VA tomorrow for a resupply and going through the defunktification (RBMS...is that a word?) process which is a hot shower and washing my clothes in extra strength something. Also looking forward to a hot meal where someone else cooks,cleans up the mess and puts away the dishes. No need for hanging the leftovers in a tree to keeps the bears from getting it!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586443,"This was probably the best weather day yet. With only 7.7 miles to hike out to US501 it was also a short day. In hiker’s terms, because I didn’t hike the full day it was considered a nero. Had I not hiked at all today it would have been termed a zero. Get it? Anyway, left camp early and headed out. I learned a valuable lesson about toilet paper today...don’t cut it too close and treat it like a rare commodity! I didn’t run out but it was sure close as I was eyeing some of the larger oak leaves I was hiking by just in case. You can’t just run to the closet and get another roll you’ve really got to plan ahead. The simple things we typically take for granted aren’t always so simple on the trail. Enough about that. When I got to 501 there was no cell signal (another thing we take for granted) and I couldn’t call a shuttle service so I had to attempt to hitch hike into Glasgow. For me Glasgow represented a needed defunktification of myself, my clothes, a food/TP resupply and a cheeseburger! I desperately wanted to get into town and tried for over an hour to hitch with no success. Finally, I stuck the thumb out with one hand and flashed a twenty dollar bill in the other and in no time I had a ride. He didn’t take my money but the twenty got his attention plus he gave me a bottle of water! Thanks Greg. He’s a Trail Angel and doesn’t even know it! The plan in Glasgow was to stay with several of the thru hikers I met yesterday at an area the town has for hikers but the shower wasn’t working and I definitely needed to take one. So tonight I’m at Stanimal’s Hostel where I was able to shower, do laundry, they’ll fix me breakfast and take me back to the trail in the morning. Great deal and a really nice hostel. Dinner was a treat as I had carry out around the campfire with Weatherman, French Fry, Powerhouse and Fresh Ground which was nice. I’ll likely not see them again as they’re doing 20 mile days and I’m not! That’s kind of the way it is on the trail and tomorrow I’ll probably meet some new hikers.

My hats off to Donna for that breakfast!! Met a new thru hiker at the hostel, Ulysses, and hiked with him all day today. The weather was almost perfect and I only had on hiking shorts, a single shirt and my running hat(and shoes of course). The day started at 677’ and topped out at 3323’ going over Bluff Mountain for a total rise of 2646’. For the last couple days we’ve been having great views of the James River Valley but when we topped Bluff Mountain it was a breathtaking view of the Shenandoah Valley. We stopped for about 30 minutes and just absorbed it. Awesome! We’ll see one more of those steep climbs on Saturday which should the last for several hundred miles. Didn’t expect to see my dinner partners again but it was a nice treat to see them on the trail this morning as they blew by us. Ah, to have twenty something year old legs! With the warmer weather we did start to see bugs(they seem to like sweaty bodies, especially eyes), butterflies and more birds. At the shelter there’s a pond in front of us and the frogs are in full voice tonight. Guess spring may finally be here! One interesting thing that happened today is I recognized a huge golf ball shaped FAA radar on top of Apple Orchard Mountain that I hiked by a couple days ago way across the valley. Made me feel like I’m making really good progress. Nothing overly note worthy about the hike just a great start to a great day with more of the same tomorrow.

Started early so arrived early. There were two other thru hikers there with the same plan but after some conversation we decided to hike about 4.7 more miles, get a shuttle and wait it out in Waynesboro at a local hostel. Upon further review a great plan. The shelter was expecting 2-3 inches of rain, was under a tornado watch, a flash flood watch and then the back side of the front was bringing snow showers. There are about 13 of us here and I’m happy to be in Waynesboro!
I hit a milestone today passing the 100 mile mark. I’m ahead of my 3 week schedule and doing well. The 4.7 mile of steep downhill over rocks/boulders for the first 2.5 miles made my knees start talking a bit but the rest they’re getting this evening is helpful. The vitamin I(ibuprofen) is also helping.
This weekend was my first experience of understanding why the estimate of 2 million hikers a year using the is true. Hiked through an easily accessible and popular area of the trail yesterday and probably saw 125-150 day or weekend hikers. It made for great conversation but definitely slows the progress. I never miss an opportunity to do a Goober says “Hey” to hikers. All shapes and sizes, young to old and literally from all over the world.
Had my first true trail magic yesterday. There’s a legend on the trail who’s name is Fresh Ground. I came on his camp at Hog Camp Gap and he prepared chicken fingers, green beans and salad for me. Not exactly trail food but delicious and a little needed fiber in my trail food diet! It was a great treat and effective.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586992,"Staying at the hostel last night was a good move. That heavy rain, strong wind and the tornado warning would have made for an “interesting” experience in a 3 sided shelter. As we were talking at the hostel someone suggested that I slack pack the Three Peaks section of the trail today. Slack packing is where you carry a borrowed day pack with just the supplies you need for the hike. Since this would be my last 3000’ elevation gain mountain until Massachusetts having a lighter pack sounded good. About 6 pounds versus 30 pounds!  The hike quickly came to an obstacle for us. Due to the heavy rain the first creek was swollen to the point you couldn’t cross it. Ulysses decided to ford it and get soaked up to his knees but I went further up the hill looking for dryer options. I found a wet log which had previously fallen across the creek that I sat down on and slowly scudded my booty from one side to the other. A wet butt was better than wet shoes, socks and pants all day. Farther up the ascent there were many trees that had fallen blocking the trail, in several places the water run off had turned the trail into the Appalachian Creek and the wind was howling with an occasional spit of snow. Guess it’s all part of the experience! As the day went on conditions improved and the sun broke through actually making for a fairly nice second part of the hiking day. Part of slack packing was I stayed at the hostel one more night(I could get used to that!). So after another good night of sleep in a warm bed without the threat of bear, bug or mouse activity I’ll be ready for my 14 miler tomorrow. One thing I did find out is I like slack packing!Life’s great and I’m really looking forward to seeing Susan this weekend. Be safe.","Tye River at VA56

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587140,"Happy official Tax Day!! Today was the tale of two halves weather wise. The day started cold, grey and windy. The temperature up on the ridge was in the upper 20’s and the moisture in the ground from the rain had frozen creating areas of ice needles that crunched as you walked along. The terrain was tolerable and despite the conditions and the rocks I made really good time. This particular section of the trail has an elevated bear alert so hiking by myself I stopped occasionally and just looked over my shoulder. There’s a heavy leaf layer so I was on edge a bit every time I heard movement in the leaves. Fortunately the rustling was always a squirrel sounding bigger than it was so no bear sightings today. I kind of think those tree rats knew what they were doing to the hikers by jumping through the leaves and probably had a smile on their little faces! 
As the day progressed the weather continued to improve and about mid-afternoon the conditions were perfect. The main challenge was the multiple creeks crossings that had turned into small river crossings due to the water coming down the ravines and water sheds throughout the area. Had to take my shoes and socks off a couple times and carefully ford through the water because the normal stepping stones at the trail crossing spots were under water.
By about 3pm I remade it to the Paul Wolfe Shelter where Ulysses was waiting taking a rest. We sat there for about 15 minutes talking with other hikers and the thought occurred that if we went another 5 miles we could make it to Rockfish Gap and have one more night at the hostel with a shower and a bed before getting into the Shenandoah National Park. It was an easy decision so off we went. The shuttle picked us up about 6pm and our day was completed.
For me it was my longest day yet totaling 19.1 miles. Not something I wanted to do this early into my hike nor is it something I plan to do on a regular basis. When the terrain is right it’s good to know I can do it if needed.
I’ll stay at the hostel a little longer tomorrow so it will be a short day of 7 miles getting to Calf Mountain Shelter. I’m trying not to get too far ahead of my schedule with my nephew joining me this weekend for the hike through the park. It will be a great weekend to look forward to seeing my wife, my dog, my nephew and some really good friends in Charlottesville. Please note that I did put my wife before my dog!!

Heck, it sounds like I’m retired! Packed and repacked my bag trying to decide what I’m sendig home with Susan this weekend that’ll lighten my load. The winter gear is definitely on the list. With so many food sources going through the Shenandoah National Park I’ll only need to carry about 2.5 days of food so that will also help. I’m about 1 mile from the Park boundary line tonight being in Calf Mountain Shelter so it’s close by. I’m looking forward to this part of the experience and sharing it with my nephew, Bud. The guys in the shelter tonight say there’s a high probability of seeing a bear in the next 25 miles so time to keep the eyes and ears open.
Again, a quiet day with only 7.7 miles completed. A nice distance as I recover from yesterday’s distance. Tomorrow should be another great 13 mile day. It’s getting dark which means it’s hikers midnight and time for bed.

They’re great guys but 5am? The day was forecasted to be partly sunny, windy with a high of 55. The rain(?) was softly falling as we left the shelter but the weatherman got the wind right...all day! Partly sunny was a hit but 55 was a strike out. The rain didn’t last long so the hiking was great and the miles clicked on by. As I’m hiking along northbound I look up and was surprised to see Ulysses coming down the hill at me southbound. He had Stanimal’s drop him off farther up the trail and he was slack packing back to Rockfish Gap. Wish I had thought of that! It was good to talk with him a bit but with the cold and the wind we were soon on our way. As lunch approached I was trying to find a spot out of the wind and came to a parking lot along the Skyline Drive where a van was parked so I took refuge behind it using the van as a wind block. After lunch and with the early start I only had 4 miles to go to get to my target of Blackrock Hut. Shelters are called huts in the Shenandoah. I guess it sounds more upscale or something. Maybe the Hut mice are more sophisticated? Made it to the Hut about 3pm joining my ex-military hikers (who are Christians) and we spent a great afternoon talking and laughing. We watched another hiker trying to set up his hammock tent system. All was going well until he tried to get in it and blip, it flipped over and dropped him on the ground! We busted out laughing along with the guys he was hiking with. I think having a video camera right then might have given us a shot at $100,000! Like all huts along the Skyline Drive they’re a fairly short distance to hike to from one of the parking areas so we had about 15 hikers at the site for the night. Most were in tents as we only had 5 in a hut that was made for 10. So after a great but windy day of hiking and conversation the day ended with a roaring camp fire in front of the Hut. It was a nice end to the day.Tomorrow will also be a great day as I hike to and wait for Susan at Loft Mountain Wayside. There’s a strong possibility of having a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake while I wait for her and then we can have lunch when she gets there!Life’s great! Be safe.","Calf Mountain Shelter

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587663,"As expected with my ex-military bunkies the day started early but this time I embraced it, said my goodbyes and got on the trail a little after 7am. It was a cool start but the first half mile of hiking was all a steep uphill climb so I quickly warmed up. Today there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, the wind was much calmer and the temperature was perfect so the hiking couldn’t have been better. I was trying to coordinate my arrival at Loft Mountain with Susan so I didn’t want to be late. As long distance planning is difficult it turns out that my arrival would be a couple hours earlier than her’s so I once again was driven by visions of a cheeseburger and fries that could be purchased at the Wayside. Turns out that our host in Ruckersville was going to pick me up but I didn’t find that out until I’d hiked the 9.5 miles and ordered the food. After lunch I laid on a bench resting in the warm sunshine until my friend arrived to pick my up.
This was the end of 14 straight days of hiking anywhere from 7.7 to 19.1 miles per day. They say you get your trail legs after two weeks but I’m not sure I’m there yet but I’m getting close. Anyway, it’s the most consecutive days I’ve ever hike and I’m feeling pretty good about the first two weeks.

Spent time with my family and friends, rested, had some real food and did some minor resupply. Susan brought two boxes of mostly freeze dried foods that I’d previously bought so I really only had to buy a few additional items at Wally World.
There was a change in plans with the shuttling of my nephew’s portion of the hike so Susan and I drove to Front Royal to pick him up about 7:30pm. He’s leaving his truck at a hostel there called Mountain Home Cabbin(not misspelled) and we will literally hike to it over the next several days. The AT comes within 150 yards of the hostel. We’ll spend the night there at the end of next week then he’ll drive back to NC and I’ll push on.
It was a beautiful day spending time with Susan and I appreciate her so much being willing to let me be on my great adventure. Daisy is Daisy and she had a large time playing with our friends Golden Lab.

It would have required doing back-to-back 17 mile days plus we would need to stealth tent in the park somewhere. Best laid plans. The uphills and downhills seemed steeper and after 13 miles we hit a wall and were ready to stop but weren’t where we could. I took a chance and texted my friend, AT(his initials...really) about his willingness to pick us up at Swift Run Gap and have two tired hikers at his house one more night. His answer, “Can do!”. So we hiked two more miles to get to the pick up point. I’m thankful for great friends!!With the “shorter” day we knew tomorrow would be a truly short day to be in Bearfence Mountain Hut to wait out the weather.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587908,"With the poor plan execution yesterday we only had a short 9 mile day today to reach our destination. So feeling a bit humbled we started out. The weather was good (but windy, again) and we took our time enjoying the hike. This time of year the forest canopy hasn’t come out yet and at times you can turn a 360 and see hundreds of yards in any direction. It struck us how many tree blow downs had occurred over the decades and were decaying on the forest floor. It looked like a battle ground littered with the “bodies” of hundreds of casualties. This part of the trail is true ridge hiking and I guess the wind swings around from all directions and over time plays havoc on the trees. Combine that with the rocky soil and eventually down go the trees. All part of the process.
After several hours it was time for one of our delicious and nutritious lunches so we stopped at a campground for a break. We got a treat while sitting there as a beautiful bald eagle, riding the air currents, soared just above the tree tops over us. It was something to see!!
We got to an empty hut about 1:30pm but that didn’t last long. By the time we hit hiker’s midnight(8pm) the hut had 13 people in it(capacity 10) not including a couple tenters. Seems we weren’t the only ones seeking shelter from the storm.  It was a group including northbounders, flip-floppers, section hikers and two Russians just hiking the Shenandoah. The last thing I see is those two still enjoying the camp fire as the rest of the hikers were in their bags. 
For me I’m doing good, no new pains and I feel like I’m earning my trail legs. Having a great time with Buck 55, meeting new people daily and understanding that everyone doesn’t think the same way I do. I can’t imagine!!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587937,"Being a weather forecaster would be a good profession. You could be right half the time and still keep your job! The rain that was supposed to start at 3pm, then 5pm, then 8pm actually didn’t start until 5am. Even then it was just a sprinkle and not what was forecasted so people starting getting up and ready to hike. We could handle hiking in the cloudy fog during a light rain so decided to hike to Big Meadow Wayside which would get us there about lunchtime(cheeseburger and their famous blackberry milkshake!). If only we’d had a cell signal and could see the radar. 
The real rain and wind started about 30 minutes after we left the hut and was continuous. The rain gear was helpful at first but with the physical activity of hiking the sweat started and after awhile I couldn’t tell if the gear was leaking or it was the sweat but I was soaked through my clothes and to the bone. Then add the wind. As we got closer to the Wayside the terrain flattened and we hiked harder to get there. After the 7 miles we finally walked through the front door a couple of wet,cold and wind blown hikers. 
In the restaurant were a couple of our hut mates from the previous night, Hard Knocks and Furnance. We went to the restroom to get out of our wet clothes and warm up, ordered the anticipated food and contemplated options. Ultra Runner came in and joined us. We decided to go to a hostel or hotel in Luray, Va instead of pushing on to the next hut. No room at the hostel so It’s the Cardinal Inn. A waitress at the Big Meadows restaurant was getting off work and offered to drive us down the mountain (and also back up it tomorrow-trail angel!).
So it’s 5 of us in a room for 4(like the hut) but it’s warm and dry plus a hot shower...and pizza! The weather tomorrow will be better but we’ll only go 4.4 miles to our targeted hut from today. The next few days will be good and we plan to steadily hike to Front Royal to complete the Shenandoah. But we’ll stay flexible...

What difference a day makes as today we could actually see the big meadows! After hiking for a couple hours we arrived at the hut, rewatered, rested but realized there was a bunch of daylight left on a good weather day. We also determined that if we pressed on it’d make for a shorter distance over the next couple days getting to Front Royal so off we went. We got as far as the Skyland Resort, cameled up on water since we knew we’d be tenting and found a legal camping area about .4 miles beyond the property, found three good tent sites and set up camp. After dinner I wanted to call Susan and had to walk back to the resort for a strong signal. After that I talked with a couple thru hikers I recognized having dinner then started back to the camp in the dark using my headlamp. About half the way back I ran into Buck 55 and Furnace out on a search party. Apparently soon after I left camp they spotted a black bear running in the same direction I went. When I hadn’t returned I guess they figured I’d been mauled and was laying on the side of the trail! Nice guys!! No harm no foul and we got in our tents for a semi-restless night of sleep. With the wind continuing to blow everything I heard sounded like a bear creeping up and getting ready to bounce!

After seeing the bear so close to camp yesterday evening we halfway expected our food bags to be destroyed during night despite being hung in a tree. They were intact so after another oatmeal breakfast we packed up our gear and started out. Today the overlooks out over the western valleys were gorgeous as we went up and down the trail so we took a load of pictures. When most people in the Hickory area think about the AT I believe they envision going to Blowing Rock and hiking the old Cone carriage trails. Not close. So far there have been very few areas of the trail that are similar to that and the best word I can use to describe my AT experience so far is...rocky. Sure there is plenty of gravelish type rocks but most of the SNP, especially our current section, is made up of rocks that are 4-12”+ in size that you have to carefully navigate. These kind of areas are call “ankle breakers” so each step is deliberate as you slow the pace. Fortunately only a couple near misses with our threesome. The hiking poles are handy(especially for those of us that qualify for AARP) giving two extra points of ground contact for support.
With the great weather the miles clicked by(sort of) and we decided to hike past our Pass Mountain Hut target. The great weather of today is forecasted to be miserably rainy again tonight and early tomorrow so we opted to stay at the Open Arms Hostel in Luray. The designated pickup spot of Neighbor Mountain parking lot gave us a few extra miles today leaving us fewer tomorrow to get to the next hut.
We’re meeting more southbound section hikers(3 ladies from Quebec) and are still being passed by northbound thru hikers with their strong legs that started in Georgia some 900+ miles ago. It’s always interesting to stop and talk for a bit.
So another great day with above average miles leaving two days to go the 23 miles to Front Royal. We’ll start a little later in the morning letting the bad weather pass through and will target Gravel Springs Hut for our last night in the SNP.

Our strategy of waiting out the heavy rain worked this time! Although it was afternoon the air was fresh, cool and damp after the rain so our hiking was brisk. The rain also made the rocks slick and the areas of wet leaves that covered both rocks and roots made for some focused hiking. We knew it would be a short day and that many other hikers stayed off trail for the rain event so expected a full hut which kept us pushing on. We averaged just over 2 miles an hour and got to a fairly full hut about 5. We marked out territories and set about getting ready for the night. Several other hikers showed up and after another great fire we settled into our sleeping bags about 8:30pm.
I’ve hiked 20 of the last 21 days(took one zero) and have averaged 11.3 miles per days hiked. At this point I’m happy with those numbers but the miles per day should continue increase after we exit the SNP. But the “Roller Coaster” is coming up in a few days...

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588340,"The day was cool, dry, with a light breeze and low humidity so probably the best hiking conditions yet. We got an early start leaving the hut about 7am and the lesser terrain of the northern Shenandoah didn’t let us down.There we’re the usual up and downs but the trend was down as we worked toward leaving the ridges of the Shenandoah and getting into the relative “flatlands” at Front Royal. With Buck 55 leading the way the miles breezed by and we stopped for lunch a little before noontime at Tom Floyd Wayside. The distance covered in less than 5 hours was 10.0 miles. We shared the lunchtime stop with a group of hikers from the Hudson Valley Hikers club that drove down from NY to complete a 30 mile weekend hike. In the Shenandoah the term “Wayside” usually means cheeseburgers and fries but since we’d exited the SNP a couple miles earlier it meant lunch was a tuna burrito and a Snickers bar chased with Tang flavored spring water. After lunch we only had 3.9 miles to go to get to the Mountain Home Cabbin where we had left Buck 55’s truck last Saturday afternoon. 
One of the things we noticed as we descended in elevation was that spring had definitely sprung in the lower forests. The canopy above us was breaking through with tender green leaves. The forest floor was also sprouting leaves but the colors of white, pink, yellow and purple dotted the green as blossoms had appeared on plants. It was beautiful and I knew the ridges above us would follow in the next few weeks.
We arrived at the hostel shortly after 2pm and mostly rehydrated on several green bottles of cold trail magic hikers from the night before had left in the hostel refrigerator, took showers then went into Front Royal for some resupply. Also went looking for a fat juicy steak but ended up with.....another delicious burger!
Hiking with my nephew has been great as he’s been our pacesetter, a trail trash collector for SNP and a great hiking partner. Hopefully we’ll be able to reconnect in NC on the trail in the early fall when I’ve flip flopped and I’m heading south toward Springer. I’ve really appreciated his companionship.

Sweat might need to be added to the list..and stink. But today, what a marvelous day! After a good night of sleep and a wonderful french toast breakfast at the hostel Furnance and I said our goodbyes to Buck 55 as he headed down the road and back to the real Monday world. We immediately headed to the trail and started our trek to Whiskey Hollow Shelter about 15 miles up the trail. It was a good hike and favorable terrain so we once again did 10 miles before lunch stopping at Manassas Spring Shelter. About 5 minutes before arriving at the shelter we passed by a group of five Asian women who were obvious day hikers. They had just left the shelter where they had cooked a small feast of Korean food on an open campfire leaving the leftovers there with another hiker. Soooo, we ate leftovers of some kind of deliciously spicy Korean food, cooked by people we didn’t know that was being recommended by an unknown hiker. Seemed reasonable to me!! It was really good. After about 30 minutes and no adverse side effects it was time to move on.
Arrived at the shelter at 4ish, set up our stuff and chatted with the 4-5 hikers there until 8ish and now all of us are in our sleeping bags after a beautiful, long mileage day. Tonight the temperature is supposed to be at the freezing mark so another cold start in the morning. Where the heck is spring? The temps are heading toward the 80’s by weeks end so we’ll probably be wishing the coolness was back. Can’t please all the people all the time!!
Tomorrow we’ll enter the “Roller Coaster” which is an area of 13 steep up and downs in a relatively short distance. Our plans is to hike until we get tired and hopefully be near a shelter when that happens. If not we’ll just tent near a water source. That’s tomorrow but today was another good day!

We didn’t see near as many people today with the weekend behind us but did meet a couple brothers from Germany that are thru hiking. No Worries from the shelter last night blew by us trying to get to a spot where her parents were picking her up for a couple days. There were a couple other hikers but mostly it was just us. During the morning we came on a spot where there were thousands of plants with beautiful blue blossoms on them. One of the German brothers commented that it was like an ocean of flowers. I really liked that description.
We got to Rod Hollow Shelter for lunch and broke out the tuna fish and tortillas and made a burrito. Followed it up with a peanut butter and honey burrito then a Snickers for dessert. Actually it was all pretty filling with plenty of calories.
After lunch we’d cover enough miles that we entered the dreaded AT Roller Coaster. The Potomac AT Club actually has a sign up warning hikers about it. It’s an area about 14 miles long that has 12-14 steep climbs followed by steep descents. Where we sheltered for the night is about half way through the section. Despite the challenge we were still able to cover some ground. 
Got to an empty Sam Moore Shelter about 4:30pm and set up our stuff. Cleaned up in the creek in front, laid out our gear then prepared dinner. We heard a noise in the dry leaves and there were 4 deer that were lazily grazing along on the other side of the creek in front of us. I was putting my cooking pot away and it clanked on the sleeping platform and up went their white tails and they vanished. Still a beautiful thing to see.
We were getting ready to hang the food on the bear pole then turn in when I looked up and in the corner of the shelter was a 4’ black snake. It proceeded to go down a crack in the sleeping platform right where the head of my sleeping bag was. The good news is there’s likely no mice at the shelter and the other good news is it was still light enough for us to set up our tents! Yes, I know black snakes are harmless but it’s just the thought of that thing coming back out of the crack by my head in the middle of the night!! Believe a 911 call would have gone out along with a scream like a girl!!
Hopefully will sleep great in my zipped up tent tonight. Not trying for as many miles tomorrow so it should be another great day.

Our legs could still feel the workout we got yesterday as we entered the Roller Coaster and knew that today would more of the same. The trail didn’t disappoint our expectations. Throw in some higher temperatures and were sweating 5 minutes after leaving camp. I had two songs playing in my head off and on through the day, “Love Roller Coaster “ by the Ohio Players and Spinning Wheel” by Blood, Sweat and Tears. Good, now most of you (the Boomers) have them playing in your heads also! I’m pretty sure someone in the group BST must have done the Roller Coaster to come up with the opening line of their song!!
Had kind of a milestone today crossing into West Virginia. There’s 4 miles of the AT that goes through WV but in reality we’ll be in and out of VA and WVA until we get passed Harper’s Ferry. The first of many state lines to be crossed on the hike.
It’s interesting how the simple things in life that we take for granted are not so simple out here. The convenience of food, shelter and water at home are key elements for planning out here. You’re always checking where the next water source is to determine how much extra you need to carry. At 2.2 pounds per liter you don’t want the extra weigh but if you don’t consume enough then it’s dehydration. Not good. One other item that I used to take for granted but not anymore is a bathroom with a flushable commode! The words actually came out of my mouth today about “the luxury of having a privy” at the shelters along the way. They’re not pretty, most of them smell foul(when I can the door stays open during use) and they usually have bugs and spiders but, it truly beats the alternative(use your imaginations!).
After clearing the rest of the Roller Coaster the terrain was gentle so Furnace and I only needed to hike until 3pm to get to our destination which is a nice, donation based hostel run by the Potomac AT club. We enjoyed the late afternoon, took our time with dinner and have been taking it easy in the Adirondack chairs on the hostel porch with a comfy, cool breeze. Great ending to another day of hiking. The plan for tomorrow is get into Harper’s Ferry to resupply, shower and wash some funk from our clothes.

The 3 goals for today were hiking early to beat the heat, make it to a particular road crossing for an early lunch and get to Harper’s Ferry. We were 3 for 3! The particular road crossing had a Liberty gas station with a deli that also served fried chicken. We made it the 6.5 miles to the crossing a little after 10am and enjoyed brunch. The chicken wasn’t Colonial Sanders but it sure was good!
Had a Wiley Coyote event occur yesterday that was like a scene out of a Road Runner cartoon. As I was walking along keeping my eyes on the ground watching for rocks and roots I should have also been looking up for trees that had blown partially down. Seems there was one about 10” in diameter that was hanging about 6’ off the ground across the trail. Not a problem for most people but being 6’4” it was for me. Bam!! I hit it in full stride and rebounded backwards landing on my butt and backpack but my hiking poles kept going forward. It was my first fall of the trip and it was a good one. No stars spinning around my head just a bit humbling.
We came across a hiker taking a break and stopped to chat. She said she was following through on a SOBO hike that was started in September. For hikers we knew that she meant southbound. It occurred to me that AT hikers have words that are unique like code that we understand but others aren’t familiar with. It’s similar to going into a Starbucks and asking for a medium and the person in the green apron giving you that look and saying, “Oh, you mean grande”. So here are a few others; trail soup means a muddy area of the trail, a zero means taking a day off and not hiking, nero means only hiking a short day and of course NOBO means northbound since SOBO means southbound. Us flip floppers are just out luck because I can’t find an acronym for what we’re doing. 
So we got into Harper’s Ferry before 3pm and went straight to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters. Guzzled down a couple Gatorades, got our pictures taken for posterity and talked with the guy minding the store. Furnace had a highly anticipated package waiting for him there...a new, lighter weight tent. So we finished up there, walked down the main street of beautiful, historic Harper’s Ferry and checked into our hostel. It’s in a building that’s 178 years old and it’s beautiful!!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588977,"Taking a zero in Harper’s Ferry was a good choice. After a hot shower, a restaurant meal and 9 hours of sleep this morning I was feeling much better. Harper’s Ferry is an historic touristy kind of place with only about 300 people that actually live here so this time of year the restaurants close about 6pm. For the morning there are a few places that sell coffee, including a coffee shop, but nothing opens until 10am! A little late for that first cup.
We each had a few extra things in our packs we wanted to mail home so we walked about 3/4 of a mile to the post office. On the way back we decided to go back to the AT and hike from the place we exited the trail yesterday to a place down hill from the hostel. It was 0.6 miles but it counted! So technically, today was a nero and not a zero...sort of. Mid-morning we took the bus for a resupply run to Walmart then hung around that area and had lunch making it back about 1:30pm. Furnace opted for a short nap and I went to do the history walk about. There are events that occurred in this little town over 150 years ago that have had a profound impact of the USA. It’s interesting so you need to look it up. 
We’re back to the trail in the morning staying in shelters or tents but one aspect of staying in a true hostel that I I’m fond of is getting the clothes laundered. Especially shirts. Much better than rinsing the sweat, salt and grim off in a stream or even under a water faucet like I’ve done a few times. Then you hang them on something and hope they’re dry in the morning when you change back from your sleeping set of clothes. If they are dry great and if they aren’t dry it doesn’t matter because you have to press on! I guess the hostel’s hot shower ranks right up there with the laundry. As it gets warmer taking my “jack-of-all-trades” wash cloth (I don’t do everything with it but close) will be used more to take sponge baths in creeks. On colder days I’ve been filling my only cooking pot with water, heat the water on my cook stove then go to the privy and take a “bath”. Not ideal but it’s better than being grimy in my sleeping clothes while I’m in the sleeping bag. It’s amazing how much better you feel even with that kind of “bath”. Still, it’s not like a bath or shower. Guess I’ll keep using the hostels along the way so I don’t loose all touch with the rest of humanity!! Trust me that there are some out here who definitely have lost that touch along with their sense of smell!!
Expecting almost 90 degrees again tomorrow so an early start with a 15 mile day to get to our shelter goal. Water sources are scarce on this next section of trail so in addition to the weight of the food resupply we’ll have to carry extra water weight. Also, once we leave in the morning and cross half way over the Potomac River bridge we’ll be in Maryland. Should be a good day.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589075,"Had the alarms set for 5:30am but the owner of the hostel started thumping around upstairs above us about 4:30am so we were ready to go when the alarm went off. Left a little after 6am expecting a long, hot 15 mile day. Leaving Harper’s Ferry took us across the Potomac River footbridge and halfway across we left West Virginia and entered Maryland. About 90 minutes later I hit another milestone by passing the 300 mile mark! The terrain was less strenuous than anticipated so we made good time and had 10 miles in by lunch. Prior to getting to Rocky Run Shelter we’d decided to only rest there awhile and to camel up. With the sweat and grim of the day our new target was Dahlgren Backpack Campground to make a 17.3 mile day for the free, hot showers they offered. With wet weather expected we’d rather be clean and comfortable in our tents than sticky and nasty in the shelter. Good decision. Set up our stuff, had dinner and we were cleaning up when a hiker said they were ordering pizza and soft drinks that would actually be delivered 0.2 miles from the campground. I was in!! So I had 3 pieces of Dominos and a Sprite as my second dinner. Some days the “hiker hunger” is real and this was one of those days.
Expecting rain for tonight and tomorrow so we’re playing it loose on what the goal is. There’s one shelter at 6 miles then the next is 14 miles so we’ll see what  the weather does. Today was a bunch of miles and heat for a couple old guys so I bet sleep comes easy. But we did just have a group of 16 Boy Scouts and leaders show up so I hope it gets quieter.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589326,"It was a good early start to the day. The first round of rain came during the night and the Zpacks tent performed as advertised. The day was cloudy and cooler as the trail took us through the Washington Monument State Park where the original monument to GW was erected some 60 years before the one in DC. The short brown rock one in the park wasn’t as as impressive as the tall white marble and granite one in DC but it was the first! The trail was mostly generous with the exception of several boulder fields we had to traverse. Kind of a precursor to what large sections of Pennsylvania are supposed to be like. We stopped at a shelter for a break and read through the shelter log to see the entries. There were several references to something called the Four State Challenge that hikers were trying to accomplish. The goal is to complete a 43 mile stretch that covers part of the trail beginning at a spot in VA, all through WVA and Maryland and finish by crossing the Mason-Dixon into PA all in 24 hours! This is typically done by the “young guns” that started in GA and have over 1000 miles of the AT behind them. The kind of thing that gives you bragging rights and all I can say is more power to them! Furnace and I talked about starting a new Four State Challenge whereby you have to eat a cheeseburger with all the trimmings plus fries in all of those states! Now that’s something I think more hikers could accomplish!!
With the threat of rain we covered the 14 miles by 2:30pm making it to the shelter without getting rained on. It was occupied by a couple characters, one a thru hiker that wouldn’t give us his name and one strange fellow that looked more like he lived there(his name was Paul With Bunyons). It was an odd afternoon with them but fortunately others showed up bringing a level of normalcy to the mix. The main part of the rain finally came as promised accompanied with thunder and lightning so we were glad to be in the shelter. Despite the characters in the shelter it was another good day on the trail.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589361,"Off and on sleep during the night with storms dumping rain that pelted the sheet metal roof of the shelter. I was awake about 4:30am and since it wasn’t raining checked the radar. There was a significant area of no rain that looked like a window of several hours. As soon as Furnace stirred we quickly packed up our damp gear, ate a dry breakfast and moved out. Another day of mostly good terrain except those rocks seemed to get bigger the farther north we go. Had a couple steep up and downs which slowed the progress but still managed about 2 miles per hour. There really wasn’t anything noteworthy about the hike today. I say that with hesitation because the forests, wildlife, streams and scenery continue to be beautiful but it’s almost an effect of being desensitized to the beauty. How many degrees of beautiful are there? 
We got to Pen Mar Park for lunch and the rain started. We made the decision to head into Waynesboro, PA for a resupply, laundry, hot meal(steak this time, no cheeseburger) and a hotel for the night. We arranged for a shuttle service and hiked another 3/10’s of a mile in a light rain to the pickup point. In that short distance we passed over the Mason-Dixon Line leaving Dixie behind and entered Pennsylvania! In the morning we’ll head north through the Keystone State keeping an eye out for those boulders we keep hearing about.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589460,"The questionable weather of yesterday was followed by a near chamber of commerce day today. The shuttle picked us up from the hotel at 7am but not before I ate a large breakfast compliments of the hotel. There were a bunch of hikers there and I’m fairly certain that with our combined appetites we put a hurting on their breakfast budget. The shuttle dropped us off and we were on the trail by 7:15am. By starting early we’ve noticed we’re seeing a larger number of deer and today was no exception. Beautiful creatures that seem to navigate across the forest floor and through the underbrush effortlessly. One second they’re there and the next they’re gone like Scotty beamed them up! Crossed many streams today, skirted around the edge of classic Old Forge Park that was originally a CCC work center in the 1930’s then stopped for an early lunch. Bought a banana at Wallyworld yesterday so had a treat of two peanut butter and banana burritos, a handful of Hot Tamales candy and the always delicious root beer flavored water! I’ll do that again.
The roughly 10 miles completed before lunch left us a short afternoon of 5 miles traveling along the ridges and though some shaded pine forests. The ground in the many of lower areas doesn’t drain well and with yesterday’s rains there were many sections of muddy hiking. After a couple hours we were at our shelter, marked our territory inside the shelter(spread our stuff out), took the half-mile downhill walk to the water source, then chilled out on our sleeping bags. 
Dinner will be early and with a good cell signal I’ll be able to read about some current events until I get aggravated and then listen to music to calm back down. Expect it to be an early entry into my sleeping bag tonight. With the spacing of shelters along the trail we’ll likely only do 13 miles tomorrow but expect it to be another good day. Aren’t they all?

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589696,"Forunately at the Rocky Mountain site there are two side-by-side shelters; Furnace and I were in one and there were three hikers in the other. Also had about 8 tenters set up just down the hill. One of the young hikers in the other shelter had an upset stomach and I gave him some OTC med’s in hopes of easing his pain. Ah, no. Apparently what he needed was an industrial strength stomach pump because in the wee hours of the morning he started round after round of hurling. It sounded awful and it echoed down the hill waking the tenters. I’m told he had at least six episodes but fortunately only two of them woke me up. When we left the next morning we checked on him and he was a pale shade of green like the slime in some of the creeks. As we started out of camp and up the hill back to the trail episode seven hit him. Miserable. There is a road down the hill from the shelter and he was going to crawl down to it and get a shuttle to an ER. Poor fellow.
We were trying to get an early start because the AT crosses a busy road 3 miles up the trail and if you go 3/10’s of a mile west from there you’ll find Timbers Restaurant. We went west and got more and more excited about a hot, non-instant oatmeal breakfast. As we were walking down the road three dejected hikers met us and said the power was out at the restaurant. Now there were five dejected hikers. Furnace and I decided they’d have juice or ice cream or something they could still serve us so on we optimistically walked. And ain’t God good? As we were taking off our packs outside their front door the power came back on and we had hot coffee, eggs, sausage, toast and juice. It was fabulous!
We made it back to the trail which almost immediately went through part of Caledonia State Park. It seems that the states parks we’d hiked through all had the tall, beautiful evergreen trees with rock structures and plenty of streams. This one almost felt like you were hiking through New England. We pushed on hiking through the typical forests, rocks and ridges until we came on a particularly beautiful section of trail. This was a forest of nothing but tall evergreen trees; mostly pine and hemlock. As we got closer it got darker and cooler as the sunlight was being blocked by the dense covering of branches. It made me think of the Mirkwood forest in Lord of the Rings. It was a neat experience that only lasted about 20 minutes but it was memorable.
With another day of favorable terrain( or maybe I’m finally getting my trail legs?) we made it to Birch Run Shelter. It’s a well maintained shelter in a spacious and beautiful setting. They even had a new double wide privy that was so new it still smelled like the plywood it was made from and not like a privy! From the shelter I spotted a flat area just down the hill and under the trees beside a stream that was the shelters water source. When I used to take the boys to Wilson Creek I had a favorite spot beside the water. Hearing the sound of the water rushing over the rocks all night was calming and restful which generally translated into a good night of sleep. I was excited to find a similar setup so decide to tent. I wasn’t disappointed and had one of my best nights of sleep since I’ve been on the trail.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589712,"A great night of sleep coupled with a planned short day equaled me sleeping in until 6:30am. It felt great. We were in no hurry with a plan of only going ten miles to the Ironmasters Hostel at Pine Furnace State Park. Staying there meant all the simple yet rewarding amenities a hostel could offer. We got on the AT about 8:15am and cruised along at subsonic speed(for us) once again covering the ten miles before Noon. During the morning we passed an exciting spot for thru hikers that started at the AT’s southern terminus of Springer Mountain in Georgia;  it’s the halfway point or 1095 miles since their beginning. It’s emotional for some based on the accomplishment and frustrating for others because they realize there’s still 1095 miles to go and it’s not exactly downhill from here! When you get to Pine Furnace State Park theres also the famous(to thru hikers) Pine Furnace General Store where you can order great fast food at really unreasonable prices. Beside the food the draw is the thru hikers half-gallon ice cream challenge. It’s as simple as it sounds...you have to eat a half-gallon of ice cream in one setting with no rules about how long you have to keep it down. It’s a rite of thru hiker passage and there were 4-5 that didn’t hesitate beginning to quickly consumed the ice cream and for one fellow, he then ate lunch. The hiker hunger was all over him!!  With their accomplishment they all received the coveted wooden spoon as a reward. Since I haven’t earned my half-way status I didn’t feel worthy of participating in the ritual. My half-way point will be in the middle of the White Mountains of New Hamspire so I’ll have to create my own challenge.
After a delicious chicken and avocado quesadilla with a larger side of greasy, salty fries we decide not to stay but push on to the next shelter 7 miles farther up the trail. The small shelter was already full when we arrived mostly with a group of 60-something year old sisters attempting a flip-flop thru hike so out came our tents for what I hope will be another restful night. Just have to get the hoot owl down the hill to find another perch and the dog in the distance to calm down.

Slept pretty good again in the tent. There’s no snoring(by someone else), no rustling around during the night by other hikers and no mice to contend with. I think I plan to do more of it. We planned an early start because you go 1.3 miles up the trail, turn right at the road then walk about 300 yards and the next then you know you’re eating an egg, sausage, cheese and tomato breakfast sandwich....or two! Being sufficiently full(until mid-morning snack time) we headed back to the trail for the short 6.8 mile trek to the targeted shelter. During the last couple days while walking through the forests we’ve noticed large man-made holes in the forest floor that you can tell have been there a long time. We’ve speculated that the holes were from trees that had blown down but no rotting trees around the holes, that the pits were dug during the Civil War for troops to hide in and finally...aliens. Fortunately, we ran into a retired local day hiker on the trail today, Hoot Owl, and he had the answer. They are pits that were over dug 100+ years ago to burn trees in to create charcoal. The charcoal was then transported and used in the area furnaces (like Pine Grove Furnace) to make metal. Mystery solved and we’re a little more educated.
The reason for the planned shorter day was the next shelter after our targeted one was 16 more miles ahead. Doing 24 miles in one day is something for the young guns with cartilage but not us. Arriving at the shelter about 12:30pm we dried out a bit from a morning rain, ate lunch then decided we needed to push on. A plan quickly developed to hike another 4 miles into Boiling Springs to shorten Friday’s planned hiking distance to 16 miles, find a cheap hotel then rest for tomorrow’s hike. Another good plan! On the way into Boiling Springs we climbed over Center Point Knob where there was a plaque on the crest. In 1937, when the 2,060 miles or so of the AT was originally completed(2,190 miles now), this spot was the mid-point of the trail. Again, very cool that Earl Schaffer, Grandma Gatewood and all the other hikers who have ever completed a thru hike had to go over this spot on their journey. If only those rocks could talk!!
So tonight we’re clean, dry, full and resting comfortably in a hotel...again. I could really get used to this kind of trail life!!
Planning a zero on Saturday with Susan coming tomorrow evening. I’m looking forward to spending time with her and touring around the area without a 2” by 6” white blaze to guide us. There’s plenty of history to experience in a little town south of here called Gettysburg....

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589950,"A gorgeous day combined with the mostly flat terrain of the Cumberland Valley made the miles ease by. The hike took us through honeysuckle scented forests to pastures complete with unconcerned cows(NOT honeysuckle scented) to immense, rolling fields of green grasses. Deer, rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks and one groundhog filled in the gaps as the day went by. Climbing out of the valley near days end provided us with a view of an area rich in agriculture and we could also see the hills on the far side of the valley where we’d been hiking the last couple days. It was a rewarding end to another great day.
Early in the day I passed 400 miles marking another milestone in my journey. When I texted a picture of the number “400” made out of sticks laying on a rock to the family I also pointed out that it was like walking from our house in Hickory to Susan’s mother’s house in Birmingham. Helps to put it in perspective. Once I walk that far 4.5 more times I’ll be done!!
Trail magic is wonderful!! There’s a long section of today’s hike where sourcing water is an issue. We were expecting to have a good source at an AT maintenance station but were disappointed to discover the water in their well had become contaminated with giardia and was unusable. Bummed out we had no choice but to continue moving up the trail. At a road crossing that was within a mile of the station sat a man in a pickup truck and in the back was a big cooler of drinks and snacks!! Said it before but ain’t God good!! The gentleman’s name is Mike Burton also known as Magic Man! I had two drinks which covered my need for fluid but also had a huge oatmeal creamer pie (330 calories) filling my afternoon junk quota. Love me some trail magic!!
With Susan coming later today and me taking a zero tomorrow, Furnace and I will be splitting up for the next week. His wife is coming next weekend so we’re hoping the hiking miles will catch us up again the following week. We’ve been great hiking partners with similar styles and abilities and we give each other a push when needed. I look forward to seeing him again up the trail.

When Susan told her classes she was going to Gettysburg to see me several kids thought we were meeting in Tennessee. Gatlinburg does sound like Gettysburg! Makes me think there’s a teachable moment in there for the history and geography teachers. Unfortunately, when you drive through Gettysburg, some of the similarities to Gatlinburg are there in the sense that business after business is trying to hock the Civil War. We contributed to their local economy, learned more about that bloody and significant battle, took pictures of the North Carolina memorial  then traveled back to Carlisle. It was a great.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590362,"Got a later start to the day with Susan in town. We went to a local diner and had some good breakfast groceries full of protein and grease. Apparently I’m not consuming enough calories and the weight loss is obvious. It’s hard to eat the amount of food and junk I need to so I guess I’ll go to four Snickers a day instead of two! I hate it. We said our tearful goodbyes out in the Pennsylvania countryside where I’d finished hiking on Friday afternoon, I headed north into a wet pasture and she headed south to Hickory. It had been raining some through the night so everything was wet and there was a misty dampness in the air. It didn’t take long for the 40% chance of showers to start periodically coming down making the already cool air feel colder. About half way through the morning I needed to stop at one of the shelters and when I did the bottom fell out and was accompanied by several rumbles of thunder. Had to hunker down for about an hour until the rain eased up and then I pushed on. Just two days ago I had walked from one side of the Cumberland River Valley to the other and now after hiking over numerous ridges I was beginning a two mile steep descent into a narrow portion of the Susquehanna River Valley. I’m sure it was beautiful but with the low cover the views were being swallowed by the foggy clouds. 
When I’m cold and wet my appetite isn’t there but knew I had to eat so when I got into Duncannon my feet took me to The Doyle Hotel and their restaurant. On several blogs I’ve read that their cheeseburgers are really good. Well, duh!! That’s like saying someone’s milk chocolate is really good but isn’t it all? It was about 2:00pm and after resting awhile with a full stomach plus feeling drier my get up and go to get back out in the rain to get to the next shelter had plummeted. 
The Doyle Hotel is an iconic place for through hikers to stop for the night. The restaurant is two thumbs up but the hotel is two thumbs down. In the words of the owners.....it’s a dump. I mean how bad can it be(the $25 per night should have been the clue) so I checked in to dry out and get a hot shower. Glad that’s all the expection I had because the owners where right....it’s a dump! I’m on the top floor and it’s raining and yes, there’s a slow dripping leak in one corner. But not to worry because a 5 gallon bucket comes with the room just for such a situation! I can’t really describe the room but it looks like one that you see in the old westerns above the saloon. Really nice! The hotel’s main claim to fame is that Charles Dickens once stayed here. There’s a chance he stayed in this very room and I’m pretty sure that the mattress and bed sheets are the same ones he would have used!! Don’t even want to talk about the community shower on the 4th floor...
So I am clean and dry. Tonight I’ll be sleeping ON the bed but I’ll be IN my sleeping bag listening to the drip, drip, drip of the rain in Room 33’s bucket. Hope they don’t have mice....","AT north of Carlisle

The dripping stop shortly after the rain storms pushed through the area and I ended up with a pretty good night of sleep. I left the hotel shortly after 6am to be sure the mini-market was open next door so I could buy some breakfast. Two frosted honey buns chased down with a bottle of chocolate milk is a good start to fighting weight loss! Hiking out of Duncannon took me across the bridge over the mighty Susquehanna River and straight toward a hillside. Climbing out of the valley was going to be my only significant ascent of the day but the clouds were hanging low obscuring the view of how extensive the hill was. It was a tough way to start the day but the only way to hike to Maine was getting up the hill so off I went. At the top of the hill I found them. Big boulders! It was tough going for awhile and at one point I had to get on my butt to reach a stepping point. Fortunately the boulders downsized into mega rocks but the hiking for a long stretch was rough. The saving graces of the day was the terrain being mostly level(post boulders) and the sun coming out which translated into a 16 mile day.
When I stopped in Peters Mountain Shelter for lunch there was a young man and his girlfriend there that were two familiar faces from a previous meeting  on the trail. No big deal except that I’d found out the day before the guy was related to Susan’s best friend from high school in Birmingham! What are the chances? With that kind of luck I should have come off the trail and found a place to buy a lottery ticket!! I took pictures and sent them to Susan to share with her friend. Hard to believe. 
I pushed on during the afternoon getting to a tent site about 4pm. Soon after another AARP qualifying thru hiker got there with the trail name No Doubt. We’d met previously during lunch at the shelter. With a line of thunder storms approaching on the horizon our tents went up quickly, dinner was cooked and we got inside the tents as the wind was picking up. Fortunately that worst weather was just south of us and we only had rain...but no leaks.
Already being in our tents it’s an early night and I can hear the sound of a contented retiree from 15 yards away resting heavily. Guess it beats water dripping in a bucket!

We were heading for Rausch Gap Shelter to get out of the forecasted rain that was supposed to arrive early afternoon. We were pleased that the weatherman was once again wrong and as the terrain remained favorable we hiked the 13 miles to the shelter before Noon. With no rain in sight we decided to hike another 5  miles to a tenting site that had a water source nearby. About an hour from our destination the weather alert on my iPhone went off warning of bad weather approaching. Checking the radar it was clear this line of thunder storms wasn’t going to miss us. The wind was blowing as we got into camp and the sky was quickly darkening. Just as our tent set up was completed the rain started so we threw our gear in the tents and hooked down the flaps. The wind started howling, it got even darker then the rain really started along with thunder and lightening. Debris from the trees started landing on my tent combined with hail and heavy rain. It lasted about 20 minutes and our tents stood tall. We emerged warm and dry no worse for the wear by the event. After reorganizing our stuff and having dinner it’s another early night. The 18 miles today combined with the 16 miles from yesterday has made two old guys very tired and sore.
They say the trail takes 5 million steps to complete. If that’s true then after today I have a little less than 4 million to go!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590654,"The rain was lightly hitting the tent when I woke up this morning. Typically that kind of sound would be soothing but knowing I had to get ready, take down my tent, pack up my gear and hike out didn’t give me that soothing feeling. Prior to leaving No Worries said he had a rough night with chills and a fever so he was hiking back to a road we’d crossed yesterday and was heading to urgent care. We were both staying at the Rock and Sole Hostel this evening so I could check on him later.
Pushing off in the rain is not a preferable way to start but with a forecast of 40-50% chance for rain I figured I’d be in and out of rain showers. Well, it was almost 100% in. And those few times it wasn’t actually raining the trees were happy to let loose of whatever water they’d collected on their leaves with an assist from the wind. Rocky, raining, windy, trail soup and a temperature of 60 degrees isn’t exactly my idea of a perfect day on the trail. I was so miserably wet when I got to a shelter side trail cutoff the privy was the first structure at the site so I ducked in just to get out of the weather! Kept the door open because I can’t hold my breath that long but at least it was dry. Part of the challenge for the day was the trees blown down as a result of last nights thunderstorms. There were about 15-20 large trees and countless smaller branches that the local trail maintainers were going to have to clear. In the meantime you can either go over the big ones or around them. 
I was happy to be picked up at days end by the hostel shuttle especially knowing a hot shower was waiting. By the time he picked me up I was starting to mildly shake from heat loss so was glad he got me when he did....and that his car heater was working. 
When we got to the hostel No Worries was there in the bed, wearing his down jacket and was under his down 20 degree sleeping bag having chills. Not exactly a good sign. After the visit to the urgent care the best guess diagnosis was a tick bite. Also not good. So he’s taking antibiotics and the next day or so he’ll be off the trail resting.
After the hot shower, dry clothes and a great meal provided by the hostel I’m settling in for a restful night of sleep(assuming I can get to sleep before No Worries). Tomorrow is forecasted to be 80% chance of rain but knowing I’m back here at the end of the day takes some of the edge off.

I buggered up my right outer thigh with a deep bruise and a knot of a hematoma but fortunately it only hurts when I walk... So it was a short day and I was able to be picked up and shuttled back to the hostel for an afternoon of ice packs and Tylenol.
Despite the injury it was still an interesting hike. There were no views from the scenic overlooks due to the low clouds but that foggy mist slowly floating through the trees gave an almost other world kind of feel. Add the darker greens of the canopy with the long slender trees surrounded on the forest floor with an endless amount of light green ferns and it was almost surreal. Took several pictures but too many times those Kodak moments just don’t translate the feel of the scene. I’ll always have it in my memory. 
With all the rain of late the ground is saturated and the water is running out of places to go especially in the flatter areas of the trail. There was a 1-1.5 mile section like that today that was beyond trail soup. I kept trying to find higher ground that paralleled the trail but there finally came a point where the muck and water were too much and the only option was to hike through it. In places it looked more like a shallow Lake Appalachian than a trail with guck that was 6-7” deep in some parts. Needless to say the shoes were submerged and when a pair of waterproof shoes are submerged they tend to lose their waterproof characteristics. Fortunately this was near the end of the hike and it was a warmer day so no “chilled to the bone” today.
I’m sure when the heat of summer finally arrives there will be a desire for relief in the form of rain but right now this area(and hikers) needs a break. With chances of rain in the 80-100% range over the next couple days relief doesn’t seem imminent. Tomorrow is a planned 14 miler to Port Clinton....in the rain. The mantra on the trail is “No pain, no rain, no Maine”.  Well, as of today I have 2 out of 3 of them!! Guess it’s all part of the journey.

With each passing hour the temperature increased and at one point in the afternoon there were glimpses of a warm light in the sky resembling the sun. Although it didn’t end up raining while hiking today the lingering effects of the earlier rain was still impacting the trail but at least I didn’t have to battle water from above and below me. I was determined not to have my shoes get wet today from trail soup so I made extra efforts to go around the wet areas by going off trail through the woods. Paid a different price due to blackberry plants scraping my legs...but my feet were dry! My My fall on the rocks was also having lingering effects as each step I took was a jarring reminder that rocks aren’t soft. Plenty of rocks today on the trail but the flatter terrain allowed me to go the full 14 miles into Port Clinton. About 3 miles from the end of my hike I saw my only hiker of the day who was out testing a new backpack. He wanted to be sure I saw the Pink Lady Slippers further up the trail which were a beautiful wild orchid. Found them and their gentle and colorful features seemed out of place along the trail(Google them). Soon after seeing the orchids and only 6/10’s of a mile from the end of the hike is when I hit the hardest part of the day...a 900 foot descent. The knees and legs were already feeling the “love” from the trail and this section elevated it to a “burning love”. After that the trail flattened, crossed some railroad tracks and went into Port Clinton where I quickly had an offer of beer by a local which I passed on. My mind and body wanted to get to the Microtel and soak in a hot bathtub to hopefully get some pain relief. About that time the guy I met on the trail came up behind me in his car and offered me a ride. That offer I accepted! It would save me walking 2 more miles down a high traffic road and about an hour so I hopped in. Trail angels come in all shapes and sizes. They’re a beautiful thing.
So I’m at the hotel where I expect to stay until Sunday morning soaking, resting, elevating and taking my vitamin I. And as I look out my window I’m giddy. I see a Taco Bell, Long John Silvers, Burger King, Wendy’s, McDonalds, Cracker Barrel, Pizza Hut, Dunkin Donuts and a Starbucks. Fast food Mecca!! Meat Lovers pizza has been on my mind so I headed to the Hut and now there’s one less pizza in this world!!
I’m hoping the R and R tomorrow are beneficial but time will tell. New plan for rocks when I get back on 1the trail though...slow down and don’t fall. Thought that was plan the first time!!

There’s only so much coverage of a royal wedding that we should be made to endure. The promise of additional significant rain was fulfilled during the night and early morning temps in the upper 40’s made me happy to be inside most the day.
No Doubt got to Hamburg late afternoon so after he cleaned up and went to Walmart we met up the street at Burger King for a Whopper or two. Eased back to the hotel and watched hockey(?). He’s from the Tampa area and apparently the pro team there is in play offs. Yawn.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591335,"Having a bathroom with a mirror can be enlightening. Getting out of the shower Saturday night I noticed a bug bite on the underside of my right butt cheek(TMI?) that appeared infected. No big deal was my initial thought. Sunday morning we packed up with the promise of a warm, rain free hiking day. The hotel was only a 5 minute walk to an urgent care so after breakfast I decided the prudent thing to do was let a doctor take a look at my “situation”. So No Doubt headed for the trail and I headed for an examine. Glad I did. Upon further review the doctor confirmed an infection and sent me to Walmart to fill a prescription. Prior to leaving his office he also gave me a little kit to lance the spot at the proper time. Guess I’ll just instinctively know when that time is. Won’t that be fun without a mirror? Contorting my body, to blindly stab at a spot on my lower right butt cheek, with a surgically sharp needle, in a hit or miss manner. It’ll be like playing pin the tail on the donkey! 
It got better. The prescription, he advised, is a strong antibiotic. With that he all but guaranteed that my intestines would be adversely impacted and diarrhea would be the delightful result. Oh joy.  Not exactly the kind of thing a thru hiker wants to hear when the distance between privies is about 10 miles or so. Makes me think about a song by Archie Bell and the Drells from Houston, Texas. Glad there are tons of trees along the trail. Anyway, it gives me something to look forward to.
I made the decision to not hike today so my injuries and ailments could have another day of R and R(that’s rest and recovery) at the hotel. So more mindless television and a fast food diet is on my Sunday agenda. With another day of rest and the promise of a dry forecast I’ll do the 15 or so miles tomorrow and get this ball rolling again.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591344,"For some time now I’ve been looking forward to being in a Pennsylvania and seeing Old Soul, a 2017 thru hiker friend that I’d met last year. Today was the day! She’d texted me with an offer to help me slack pack which I accepted and the plan was put in motion. So after two days of rest Steve the shuttle guy picked me up and took me to the trail head. A beautiful day and off I went. The climb out of the valley wasn’t too difficult and once on the ridge the elevation stayed mostly flat, plus or minus in a few sections with the obligatory rocks being out in mass. The unusual thing for a Monday were the number of day hikers numbering close to twenty which made for good breaks and conversation. My focus was seeing how my various ailments would do especially the thigh. The first 3-4 miles seemed normal but as I pushed farther the pain started creeping back. By days end there was a slight hobble to my step and I was glad those 14+ miles of hiking to Eckville Shelter were behind me. Time for some Vitamin I and rest!
This particular shelter is behind a house just off a paved road so I’d texted Old Soul earlier to let her know I was ahead of schedule. She pulled up about 10 minutes after I got to the shelter, I jumped in her van and off to Hamburg we went. The hotel was first where the front desk was holding my other backpacking stuff, we did a quick run to Walmart then to Pizza Hut. We had a great couple hours catching up and talking about thru hiking. 
After she dropped me back at the shelter I got my stuff laid out in a bunk and started winding down for a night of sleep. With the exception of the return of some pain in my thigh it was a pretty great day. 
The best part of my day was spending time with my friend and the second best part was hitting the 500 mile milestone today! It’s hard to believe I’ve walked that far and it’s not quite 25% of the way yet. I’ll just have to keep on pushing along.

This was confirmed by the raindrops I heard on the shelter roof. Didn’t need anymore evidence but there was the new mud puddles being created as I watched. Glad I slept in.
It was going to be a basic 14 mile or so hike to a tent site but...the rain and the rocks! Okay, okay you’re getting tired of hearing about them and I’m getting tired of falling on then. That would be fall on them again...and again! Yes, two more times today with one of the times the fall broke a hiking pole. Just another scraped spot on my knee and an isolated bruise on my left buttock.
Hike. Rain. Fog. Rain. Cold. Rain. Rocks. Rain. Mud. Rain. Hike. Rain....there’s a pattern here that sums up the day. The good news is I did hike 7.5 miles before the rain and cold sent me into the shelter. Rule #2 also played a significant part. Getting in the shelter I was cold so put on my dry clothes to get warm. When that wasn’t enough I had to in my sleeping bag. That got me comfortable and suddenly I’m taking a nap. The rain stopped about 4pm but by then I was too warm to put my wet clothes back on so decided to spend the night. Dinner was 3 cheese lasagna, grape flavored drink, tortilla wraps and two Snickers bars. So now I’m full and ready for sleep. With the rain it’s a full house in the shelter tonight and everyone of the hikers are in their bags with some already sawing logs. After all it’s 15 minutes after hikers midnight so I’m right behind them.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591645,"With more rain on the horizon last nights shelter filled up as the evening progress with 8 hikers filling the space. I’m certain that 5 of the 8 were snorers. Six of 8 counting me but then I don’t wake myself up when I snore. Compounding this serenity was a round of thunder storms that came through about 3am. Sleep was in fits and starts.
Cool, foggy and moist to start the day but the promise of no rain with sunshine was kept. There were several boulder fields to cross most notably being the Knife’s Edge. On this one I put away the hiking poles and moved along in a semi-crablike fashion. Given that a misstep meant a meaningful drop onto other boulders you can bet the pucker factor was high. Fortunately I made it through with no issues just a couple wobbly knees. In a weird sense it helped me regain some confidence on the rocks. 
My initial plan was to stay in a shelter but the terrain was good and the fist size rocks were tolerable so the miles went by quickly. I’d also seen a note in a shelter about a hostel attached to a steakhouse that was intriguing so I descended down the ridge into Palmerton. As I got to the road I’m studying my phone for directions then a car stops and offers a ride. I’m always willing to take a little trail magic! Turns out she was a cousin of the hostel owner so I was delivered to the front door. The hostel was way above average as was the steak so another nice end to the day. A 17 mile day!
Besides fearing for my life another interesting thing that happened is seeing an Eastern Newt. These are bright, almost fluorescent orange salamander like amphibians. They’re about an 1.5” long and move slowly along the ground. Their color and size makes them look like a fishing lure but nothing bothers them. Turns out they secrete a toxin when captured so almost all the other critters just leave them alone. Beautiful how God designed this protection into the newts life.
So after a short day yesterday I had a long one today but it doesn’t go unnoticed by my body. Things(thigh, knee, foot,bug bite) are all getting better without any issues with my intestines. Looking forward to a great night of sleep then pushing through some miles tomorrow.

The first thing was to climb out of the Lehigh Gap via a steep, rocky ascent. This would prove to be the most difficult part of my journey to date. About half way up the side of the hill I put my hiking poles away and was doing basic rock climbing across parts of the face of the hill. I just thought crossing the Knife’s Edge the day before was tough! It took me longer than expected and when I was done with Lehigh Gap I was exhausted. It set the tone for the rest of the day. 
Although the elevations were flat a combination of having my energy drained early in the day and the constant beating on the bottom of my feet while hiking on the trail took its toll. Total miles for the day was only 13 but it felt like it should have been 20. At a road crossing there was information about a hostel in someone’s garage located close to the trail so that’s  where I’m staying tonight with 5 other hikers.

A carb loading meal the night before at the Kunckletown Inn plus a restful night of sleep on the garage floor(seriously) energized me. My feet and legs were still sore from the pounding by the rocks for multiple days but that was now just a part of hiking this section of the trail. The condition of my shoes didn’t help the situation and I was glad Susan had put my news ones in the mail for delivery to Delaware Water Gap. The rocks didn’t magically disappear at Smith Gap as I started so being focused on each step around the ankle breakers was again required. As has been the case for several days, the terrain was fairly level(with the exception of a couple steeper up and downs) and only a few boulder fields which helped with the miles. When I got to Wind Gap the lure of a cheeseburger was too strong so I walked the .9 miles(downhill) into town to eat and rest. I ran into Don’t Care at the cafe who also succumbed to the call of the cheeseburger! He left soon after I got there to head back to trail but I was just getting settled in.  After about 2 hours and a full belly(did someone say chocolate malt?) it was tough to get moving again especially staring at a long uphill climb just to get back to the trail. I read somewhere about ask and it shall be given...so I did and was able to get a ride back up the hill to the trailhead!! Bet that wasn’t a coincidence! 
Water is scarce along this section of trail so my pack was about 4 pounds heavier with fluid as I started another steep climb out of another gap. It leveled off again at the top....still rocky, though. After about 2 hours I caught up with Don’t Care and we settled into hiking together for the afternoon. It was getting later in day and our water was running low. After checking the maps we realized the next best place for water was several miles off at a shelter so we had to push to get there before dark arriving after 6pm. Total miles was 17 miles over the “Rocksylvania” terrain and my lower body knew it. I was glad the day was done.
Tomorrow I’ll be in Delaware Water Gap to hopefully get my new shoes and to rest my feet at a church hostel. But tonight it’s the Kirkridge Shelter and a Knorr Rice Sides dinner with a Snickers chaser. There are 4 other hikers here so I hope I get to sleep first to beat the snoring!

The pain in my feet and legs never abated during the night so the deep sleep I’d hoped for didn’t occur....even with the drugs(Vitamin I). Throw in a dose of mice that sounded like they were doing heavy construction up in the rafters and I woke up one tired puppy. As I left the shelter I was looking forward to the short 6.7 miles into Delaware Water Gap, getting to the hostel, showering then propping up the feet for a rest. The post office was still open so I stopped there first hoping to find a package with my name on it and the US Postal Service delivered...my shoes had arrived!! I’m a happy man(thank you, dear!). Went by a bakery and grabbed something to eat then bee lined to the hostel. It’s called the Presbyterian Mountain Church Hiker’s Center which has been serving thru hikers for over 30 years. It’s a great donation based ministry that’s only one block from the AT. I got settled in and turned into a slug. There’s a tube of product there that another hiker left called “Miracle Foot Repair” that I used to sooth my aching feet but nothing miraculous happened. Not that a miracle would have happened but an expiration date of 2011 might have been a contributing factor. Should have tried the snake oil...
Got restless and hungry after awhile so one of the other hikers there, Bamadog(yes, he’s a fan of the wrong team from Alabama) and I went to get a sandwich at the bakery. Still restless when we got back to the hostel and needed a Walmart run for a resupply so was able to get a shuttle(another part of the ministry) into Stroudsburg. I was a little nervous about immediately hitting the trail without trialing the new shoes so got back to the hostel and put them on then headed north on the AT towards New Jersey for a walk. The trail north goes over the Delaware River bridge and halfway across I went over the state line actually leaving Pennsylvania and entering NJ. Just briefly. After getting a picture of the state lines painted on the bridge I returned to the hostel(in PA) for the rest I’d been looking for.

I left the hostel about 6:15am shortly after Bamadog. Leaving Delaware Water Gap the trail almost immediately goes over a bridge crossing the Delaware River and halfway across is the state line. So after many bumps and bruises from walking on the Pennsylvania rocks I was officially crossing into New Jersey leaving the rocks behind. The thing I would soon find out is that the geological characteristics of an area don’t recognize state lines and the Pennsylvania rocks quickly became the New Jersey rocks! After a little while I caught up with Bamadog and we ended up hiking the rest of the day together. His strategy is to start early, walk slowly but quit late in the day which typically equates to doing 20 miles per day plus or minus. It was a good strategy and we ended the day with 19 miles which was my second farthest day so far. During the day I started to gain a new perspective of the beauty that exists in the less populated parts of NJ. Prior to this most of my exposure to the state was going in and out of the Newark, NJ airport. What you see in the Newark area confirms what the movie “Miss Congeniality” says the NJ state slogan should be “...Oil and Petrochemical Refinery State”. But what I’m surrounded by as I’m hiking confirmed the official slogan of “The Garden State”. It’s beautiful. Yes, the rocks continued but at least there was the promise that they would diminish as we got further into the state. In the meantime the forests were lust, the wildlife was relatively plentiful and the views from the ridge the trail was following were amazing.
This fine day we experienced some trail magic as two young ladies approaching us stopped, pulled a box of fresh donuts out of their pack and offered us a Dunkin Donut. Since I’ve never met a donut I didn’t like I was happy to accept their offer. It was a nice treat in the middle of the forest. We pressed on and as the day continued we knew we’d be in tents for the night because of the lengthy distance between shelters on this section of the trail. We watered up at a great spring where the water was gushing out of the bottom of a hill and started the search for a couple of aflat tent sites. After about two more miles we found what we were looking for on an abandoned logging road that was just off the trail and set up the tents for the night, ate supper, hung our foods bags in a tree and got into our bags for some sleep.
It was a good day of hiking and I really enjoyed Bamadog’s company. Tomorrow is forecasted to be another good weather day but for tonight I’m looking forward to a good night of sleep. I’m tired and sore from my feet to my hips.

With a good sleep I usually can recover from the previous day but lately the typical hiker hobble pain in my feet, especially my right one, hasn’t been going away. It’s also been accompanied with swelling. Regardless, I need to keep hiking forward so after breakfast off we went. I knew that Bamadog was going to be targeting something close to 20 miles again and I knew my body was saying “I don’t think so” making my target a shelter 13 miles out. Between my feet and other physical limitations I needed to listen to my body and not my ego. We had a good morning but unfortunately along the way I received a texted from Susan saying Buck 55’s (my niece’s husband that hiked the Shenandoah with me) mother had passed away. I started to think about the need to be back North Carolina but right now I needed to keep hiking. About lunch time the AT crossed a road where a restaurant was located so it was cheeseburger time! Oh, more of life’s simple pleasures!!
During lunch I talked with Bamadog about me only going to the shelter so we knew at some point in the afternoon we’d be parting ways. It was mid-afternoon when we got to the side trail to the shelter and said our goodbyes. Although it’s only been a couple days I really enjoyed spending time with him despite that Alabama shirt he hikes in!!
At the shelter I made the decision to head home for a few days to see Susan, Daisy, the doctor, friends and attend the funeral. The extended rest would also to my body good. Fortunately the shelter was about 200 yards from a road so I got on the phone with Enterprise to arrange for a rental and to have them pick me up. After some interesting discussion with the rental agent about where I was and the shelter not being on their map(really?) we came to an understanding about where I’d be picked up. I hit the road about 6pm heading south, had to pull off and sleep in the vehicle about 90 minutes then arrived in Hickory about 8:30am.

It’s always bittersweet because of the way the loss impacts the lives of so many family and friends. But  as a Christian it’s reassuring knowing that she’s in a better, pain-free place and that the day will come when we’ll see her and our other Christian loved ones again. 
The intial doctor’s report on Friday from the X-rays was good and that my right foot/ankle issue was the tissue. So rest, ice, elevate and “vitamin I” was the treatment and after diligently complying the swelling has all but disappeared. On Monday I got a call from the real doctor’s nurse saying I needed an MRI to rule out a stress fracture. I thought that’s what was ruled out on the call report from Friday but apparently not. And I guess it’s a good thing because although the swelling is basically gone the pain remains. When you’re hiking double digit miles everyday you’ve got to expect some muscle and tendon foot pain but now that I’ve been off trail for a week the pain should have subsided. It hasn’t. So now I’m patiently waiting and enjoying being at the house spending time with Susan and Daisy, doing some “honey-dos”, visiting with friends, sleeping in a warm, dry, soft bed and taking multiple warm showers each day because I can!
I’ve gone through my pack and gave it a good bath to knock off some of the sweat, grime and smell, repaired a few holes in the mesh pockets, checked my other gear, resupplied the food bag, and packed up the gear.

That visit resulted in a continuation of rest, ice and elevate plus wearing a special shoe on the right foot for two weeks. Although not what I wanted to hear it has provided time for getting some family and home items completed. The downtime has also given the rest of my body time to recover from the other aches, pains and bug bites of my first 600 miles. But I’m anxious to get going again. 
With the assumption that after my follow-up appointment next Friday I’ll be cleared to continue the hike I’ve been trying to strategize what’s next.

I’ve been experiencing her displays of brilliance ever since she said “yes” when I proposed to her all those years ago!! So, assuming all goes as planned, I’ll be doing the 30+ mile section from Newfound Gap to Standing Bear Hostel as a short trial.

So Monday we’ll be heading to Newfound Gap where Susan The Shuttle Driver will drop me off to begin the restart. If all goes as planned she’ll pick me up in Hot Springs on Saturday. My approach will be as if I’m starting all over again so I won’t be pushing the miles trying to average 11+/- per day. The SMNP has some initial impact on the daily distance as they require hikers to stay only at shelters which aren’t exactly 11+/- miles apart so I’ll have to adjust. Further complicating this is in this first section the Park Service has closed a shelter due to aggressive bear activity which will require a 15 mile day. I’ll need to get up early that morning then a slow and steady hike to get to the next shelter.

In essence, the foot injury plus some rescheduling of my hike is allowing me the beach opportunity for which I’m grateful. 
With the 3+ weeks I’ve been off trail I’m very much behind my original schedule of being through the White Mountains and at the trails northern terminus of Mt. Katahdin before the snow flies so I have another schedule modification. Once we’re back from the beach, Susan The Shuttle Driver will take me to Great Barrington, MA where I’ll head north. From there to Katahdin will be about 2 months with a targeted finishing date for this section of about September 15th. Given some of the elevations this will fairly much insure completion before the arrival of snow and ice. Fairly much. After that I’ll make arrangements to get back to Great Barrington where I’ll hike the roughly 200 miles back to NJ where I came off trail with the foot injury. Are you confused yet? It gets better!
After leaving NJ I’ll travel back to my original starting point in Daleville, VA to start hiking south to Hot Springs, NC. From there Susan The Shuttle Driver will transport me back to Franklin, NC where I’ll start the final 106 southbound miles of the AT ending at Springer Mountain, GA and finally completing the AT. Now you see why I’m transitioning from being a flip flopper to a leap frogger!! My best guess on the ETA at Springer is November 15th +/- a few days. If this all works out one benefit is that I’ll be able to see some fabulous fall colors in the northeast and the southeast.
But for now the restart will begin with that first trial hike to Hot Springs to check out the right foot. To be continued....

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595323,"After 4 weeks of rest, relaxation and most importantly recovery, I was able to get back on the trail today. After a rain delay that included an ice cream run into Gatlinburg, my lovely shuttle driver dropped me at Newfound Gap to begin the second leg of what is now my leap frog thru hike. It was a short day but another milestone day hitting the 600 mile mark so...only 1600 miles to go!! It felt good getting back on trail but after the lengthy delay it’ll take a little time to regain my trail legs. The really good news is that I had no trouble from the right foot. It was frustrating to come off trail for a month but it was exactly what my body needed.
I’ve forgotten how beautiful the backcountry of the Smoky Mountain National Park can be. The recent abundance of rain has everything from the forest floor to the top of the tree canopy lush and green. Portions of the forest through this section are so dense it gives a feeling that the trees are pressing in on you as you walk through their space. Almost other worldly but with a great sense of peace for your spirit. Maybe it’s a glimpse of what that first garden experience would have been like. These are the experiences I want to remember as I go through this journey.
There are six of us in the shelter tonight; two sets of fathers with daughters and a mate from Australia doing a walk about of the southern US. It’s an interesting mix but we are enjoying the company and conversation. We’re all starting to wind down and the song bird sounds of the day are starting to transition to the night sounds of an owl in the distance. Add in the sound of the wind in the trees with the distant low rumble of the departing storm and we’re all starting to mellow out. Besides, it’s half past hikers midnight so time to get in the sleeping bag to rest up for tomorrow.
I want to thank all for the past prayer support. It’s been much appreciated and much needed.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595542,"With rain in the forecast I left the shelter at 6:30 thinking I could get to the next shelter before it started raining. Wrong. The first round hit about 15 minutes into the hike then the pattern for the day was  brief rain showers every hour or so. It’s all part of the experience but i was having flashbacks to Pennsylvania and the wet rocks!! The SMNP definitely has a rocky trail but not like Rocksylvania!! In between showers there were moments when the sky would clear and the view of the dark green tree tops contrasting with the blue sky then being accented with the foggy white clouds rushing over the mountains was stunning. One surprise was the number of wild pink azaleas that we’re dotting the sides of the trail. I guess spring comes later on the ridges that are over a mile high in elevation. The occasional fragrance of the balsam trees made me think of Christmas which made it a really special morning despite the rain. To clarify about walking on the ridges there were times when the trail would narrow and I’d be focusing my eyes on where I was walking. At the same time in my periphery I could see clouds through the vegetation. Doesn’t leave much room for error or a misstep!!
I had an early lunch sitting on a wet log and the standard PBJ burrito and a tuna burrito tasted great plus a little rest break was welcomed. With only 4.5 miles to the next dry shelter I was again confident I could get there before the expected afternoon thunderstorms arrived. Wrong again!! About 90 minutes out the heavy rain and wind started. I tried to take refuge under a thick stand of trees until the thunder started. Not the best place to hide in that situation so I decided to press on. I arrived at the shelter with everything I was wearing being soaked to saturation. Being alone I quickly took my set of sleeping clothes out of their dry sack, stripped off my wet clothes and slipped into the dry ones. It a great feeling going from cold and wet to warm and dry!
By late afternoon there were eight of us in the shelter which was good for all because another severe thunderstorm came through and it was nice to be under cover and dry. After a delicious 1600 calorie dinner combined with a long day of wet hiking my body is relaxed and ready for a good night of sleep. But...the single guy in the group just whipped out his harmonica giving us an impromptu inhaling and exhaling of notes of a song I didn’t  recognize. For me that ranks right up there with the sound of bagpipes! He was OK but not my favorite instruments. I thought I was going to have to dig out my ear plugs but it ended up being a very short recital. Now we can all settle in for some sleep.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595588,"Had a good night of sleep with minimal snoring(from others) and no mouse activity that I was aware of. I asked the group if I kept them awake with my snoring and was told that I snore quietly(Susan may disagree). I think that was a compliment. We woke up to a beautiful morning with ample sunshine and blue skies. Checking the radar I could see it wasn’t going to last so I hit the trail. The morning was smooth hiking and the clear skies gave way to many opportunities for pictures. About 11am the wind started picking up and just before Noon the rain and storms started. Unfortunately, I mistakenly left my rain pack cover at the shelter and was definitely not going to back track 7-8 miles to retrieve it so I had to improvise. I put on my rain jacket, slipped my arms in the sleeves and then covered as much of my pack as possible with the body of the rain jacket. I’d previously treated my pack with a water repellent so that gave me some peace of mind. Also, everything I store inside the pack is in a dry sack for extra protection. It continued to rain or storm for the next several hours with the trail once again becoming a creek(pronounced creek not creak). With the hard rain there was no place to stop and eat so I just kept going. It was still raining when I got to the shelter and once again everything I was wearing was dripping wet. As I unloaded my backpack I was happy to see that it was relatively dry inside so there was some level of success with the improvised system which was good to know. 
The stone shelter is nice but has one oddity...it’s fenced in on the front! There are no bear poles to hang your food from so the solution is store everything at night inside the shelter. To keep any potential unwanted critters out(aka bears) the park service uses a fence with a door that can be latched. It’s like a reverse zoo where the humans are on the inside on display and the bears(if there are any) cruise by on the outside making funny faces(and licking their lips) at the humans. Kind of freaky to think about but it is better protection than having one side of the shelter wide open which is the norm. Anyway, it finally stopped raining, changed into my dry clothes, hung the wet ones to “dry” which is not likely in a high humidity environment(should be another fun morning tomorrow of putting on wet clothes!), laid out my sleeping bag and ate dinner. I’m already a little spooked with the bear cage but then I hear an awful squeaking and crunching sound outside  accompanied with a loud crash about 10 yards behind the shelter. Immediately I’m thinking bear attack but fortunately it was only a large, rotten branch that fell from a tree! Still got my heart racing...
It’s getting dark and it appears I’ll be the only one in the shelter tonight. Time to lock the fence and get some sleep.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595899,"The clap of thunder at 4am was my wake up call inside the safety of my cage. Fortunately my cell service was strong and the radar said go back to sleep because it looked another 4-5 hours of rain. Ended up leaving after 10am but it was a late start to a planned short day. As expected the trail was mucky and slick considering the rain from the last three days but it was the way it was. Descending from the shelter I went through the actual Davenport Gap. A typical gap has a deep descent in and a steep ascent out that wears you out so I’ve been trying to decide what Gap stands for...Giant Arse Pain!! The steep, wet descent was challenging but the ascent, wow! There was a 2900’ elevation gain from the bottom to the crest of Snowbird Peak. After numerous stops along the way for rest, fluid and oxygen I was rewarded by fabulous views of layers of grayish, purple mountains fading into the horizon. The journey up the mountain was exciting in that I spooked a bear that simultaneously spooked me back!! He(assume it was a he) was in the trees about 25-30 yards away when he bolted but he only went about 10 yards and stopped to look at me. After determining that I wasn’t going to be mauled I did what any tourist passing through any area would do...got my cell phone out and took pictures. He seemed to enjoy his Kodak moment but I didn’t want to push my luck so moved on. Kept looking over my shoulder for awhile but all was fine. Also saw a couple wild turkeys but they don’t hang around for pictures when they’re startled. It was awesome seeing these animals.
Finally got to the damp shelter in late afternoon where a father and daughter from Georgia had set up their tent. I took one of my wash cloth baths in the creek, cooked dinner and we all headed to our sleeping bags. 
The foot continues to perform as expected for which I’m thankful. Wish I could say that about my trail legs....

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595906,"I had a damp but mouse free night of sleep. The shelter was within a few yards of a creek and the constant sound of the water rushing over the rocks is always comforting so the night was good. It was going to be a long  day so I left just after first light to get a jump on the day. About 10 minutes from camp I had another bear encounter at about 20 yards away!  This time both of us were equally spooked but the bear bolts down the hill and through the trees. All I see is vegetation moving and bear butt!! It was over in an instant but was definitely an adrenaline pumping moment. But two bears in two days....awesome!!
I was the first hiker on the trail today. The way you know that is because the first hiker through is the one that catches all the spider webs that are crossing the trail. Not my favorite feeling. The next several dry, warm and blue sky covered hours were uneventful. As I was approaching Max Patch the number of day hikers increased as this is a popular day hike. When I got to the crest it was beautiful. Mostly sunny, nice breeze and 360 degree views that faded into infinity and beyond. I got my wet stuff out and laid it on the grass to dry out, ate some lunch and sat there marveling at what God’s created for us. Just amazing. I hated to leave but still had about 7-8 miles ahead of me. Most the rest of the day was moderate hiking with the exception of climbing Walnut And Bluff Mountains. The place I was tenting for the night was a large flat area in a gap(a flat gap?) about 300 yards from the summit of Bluff Mountain. It was a welcomed end to a beautiful day. I set up my tent, ate, cleaned up, hung the bear bag and was thankful to get in the tent. The bugs were relentless. I settled in for a quiet and restful night while the bugs bounced off the tent trying to get at me for a little dinner of their own. Bug mesh is a beautiful thing!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596134,"Woke up to a beautiful day with expectations of it being a superior day. Susan was meeting me in Hot Springs then onto Asheville! After a fairly good night in the tent I left camp just after daylight trying to get down the hill as soon as possible. The hike down was relatively uneventful with the exception of going through the fire zone. Earlier this year there was a wild fire that broke out in the Deer Park Shelter area that ended up destroying the shelter. Hiking along this section of trail I have to say the firefighters did an excellent job of keeping the fire contained to the eastern side of the trail. Big contrast between the east versus west sides. The trail is generally downhill through this section being a watershed for the French Broad. Because the river seems to be all over this area my dad always said “that French Broad seems to be get around”. I came off the trail at the edge of town at Laughing Heart Hostel for a fabulous shower and to do laundry. Then hiked to the Iron Horse Station restaurant for a “happy” meal..a cheeseburger with a bottomless glass of sweet tea. It’s the little things you miss! Susan got there and after lunch we went to the actual hot springs in Hot Springs for an hour long healthy soak. It was really nice and theoretically very good for you. I don’t know about that but it sure felt good.
On to Asheville to spend time with Susan, resupply, a steak dinner, half gallon of chocolate milk, a bag of Cheese Doodles(extra crunchy) and a night of sleep in a soft, clean, odorless, climate controlled room.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596137,"The concept of trialing the right foot close to home has been great because I get to see Susan more often. We left Asheville early but had to make a Bojangles run first. Fat and calories! Heading to Newfound Gap the road went by the park visitors center and it was exciting to see several of the elk grazing in the field adjacent to the center. Not something we see in the south everyday. After another goodbye I headed south in sunny, cool and dry conditions. But due to the elevations and upslope this area stays moist most of the time. The result is hiking through damp conditions where moss seems to be growing on everything. Even with the sunny day the trees are thick so the light doesn’t readily penetrate into the forest floor helping to keep everything wet. The hike was beautiful and thankfully uneventful but the views amazing when I was on the ridges! The Clingman’s Dome tower was open and with the visibility it was one of my best and most scenic views to date. Hiking along the ridges you could see rain showers forming in the distance so the race was on to get to a shelter and stay dry. Passing by numerous day hikers I kept pushing and was able to make it to Double Springs Gap Shelter just minutes before the rain hit. I was quickly joined by another hiker and we were both thrilled to be under shelter. After about 45 minutes the sky cleared and I had to push on to where my reservation was at Siler’s Bald Shelter. I wasn’t out of the clear because I could still hear thunder in the area but I made it “home” about 10 minutes before the bottom fell out. I was dry but...after the storm the clouds lingered for hours keeping us in damp air.  Everything felt wet even without being rained on. There are six of us in the shelter with one being the only back country US Park Ranger in North Carolina. It was great to talk with him and he was willing to answer tons of questions from all of us. It was also great and comforting to be in bear country with someone who was packing!
With the cloud cover it’s getting dark early so off to bed. I need the rest because tomorrow brings several stretches with significant elevation gains and I have to go 18 miles to get to my next reservation. The longer distance is mostly due to aggressive bear activity closing the shelter that was a reasonable distance away. Big day tomorrow.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596139,"For some reason I woke up not feeling 100%. Not what you want when you have a long day ahead. Everything seemed a little harder during the day and I found myself breaking for lunch and resting for about an hour. The weather was great though and just what the chamber of commerce ordered so despite not feeling good the hiking conditions were great. I saw several deer today the first two being a doe with a beautifully colored fawn. They scooted off into the underbrush quickly. I also saw a buck that was more than happy to hang around and get its picture made. Gracious animals. Also added another wild turkey to the list. When I got to the lunch shelter there was a young man there who recently graduated with a degree in philosophy from a university that’s noted for having a black dot on the bottom there feet. He was explaining to me how he’d seen a peacock during his hike today which was really astonishing to me considering they’re not exactly a native species to the Appalachian Mountains. I suggested that what he saw was a wild turkey to which he readily agreed. And that’s all I’ll say about that!
It was late afternoon when I got to a busy shelter where a fire was burning. Even when it’s warm outside there’s something comforting about having a fire. It’s like a human magnet that brings out the conversation in people. As a group of us were sitting there a big buck that was still in velvet came munching it’s way toward the shelter. Just beautiful. We didn’t seem to bother him and were excited to be 10-15 yards from an animal that would typically be spooked around people. He’s now a highly photographed critter. 
As it got dark a mild, dry wind started blowing, conversation was winding down and tired bodies retired to their sleeping bags in what was now a full shelter. For me tomorrow brings much excitement. Susan arranged for a shuttle to pick me up at Fontana Dam as I leapbfrog over a section of the trail I did in March. She also reserve a room for me at the Nantahala Outdoor Center’s hostel...with an air conditioner! I’ll have about an 11 mile hike so it’ll also be a shorter day. She’s a sweetheart!!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596148,"It was a perfect night with the dryer air and steady breeze keeping it “fresher” in the shelter. Despite half my fellow bunkies being men I only heard snoring once(hope I didn’t keep anyone awake. I tried to warn them). It was still dark when I woke up this morning with the blush of first light starting to glow in the sky. Looking out of the shelter I could make out a figure slowly moving towards us. It was that same buck from the night before getting his fill of tender greens around the shelter. At least it wasn’t a bear! Myself and another long distance hiker started backing up and as soon as the light gave depth to the ground I was off. I knew I’d be playing the role of spider web catcher again but I was pumped to be going to the NOC so I reluctantly accepted the job. Another beautiful day of mostly descending trail gave me an extra charge for getting down the hill to Fontana Dam and my waiting shuttle.
About 3 miles into it I saw two bear cubs running off to the right of the trail. As I was reaching for my cell to snap some pictures less than 10 yards in front of me was their mother. She took half a step toward me, grunted and stood her ground! I was scared, numb and shocked. If she wanted me I was all hers. I slowly started back tracking while banging my hiking sticks together, yelling(maybe screaming like a girl?) and loudly whistling. She wasn’t impressed a bit because her only concern was protecting those babies. Long after they were a safe distance away she was still in essentially the same area just off the trail keeping a wary eye on me. When she did start to move it was parallel to the trail...in my direction. I thought this was a flanking move so I put it in reverse again and moved with her. Thankfully, she turned toward the direction of her cubs but soon stopped. After about a minute or so I picked up a stick and threw it at her and she shot forward about 5 yards. That was enough easement for me and I shot forward at sub-warp speed looking over my shoulder until I was safe. This was definitely at the top of my list of sphincter tightening adventures for my hike.
About two miles later I got to a gap where a side trail led down to a spring where I needed to get water. Not 30 seconds after getting back to the main trail and started to hike again my hiking stick hit a rock making a noise. I was still unnerved by the bear experience when the underbrush started cracking and about 25 yards away there was another mother bear with two cubs busting it through the woods...away from me...thankfully! I couldn’t believe 6 bears in one morning and I was in one piece!! After that the rest of the day was comparatively uneventful.
I made it to the NOC where I ate(any guesses?), showered, did laundry, resuppied then ate again. Now I’m literally chilling in my room and being grateful for God’s protection through today’s events. It could very easily have had a different outcome.

That’s the way it was in my hostel room last night. I was tired, clean and well fed and didn’t wake up until way after the normal time I would usually leave. This delay had a benefit...the restaurant opened at 8am which worked out perfectly. So after 4 pieces of French toast, a couple eggs and several glasses of sweet tea I was ready to hike. I stopped by the general store for Gatorade and then up the hill I went. The climb out of the NOC is long and steep but by putting one foot in front of the other you’ll eventually get to where you’re  going. Along that journey today it took me to some beautiful scenery and views. The trail runs beside the Wesser Bald observation tower which had a magnificent 360 degree view. My only special wildlife encounter today came as I was rushing up the trail. The large stick ahead looked different only to quickly realize it was a 3.5’ long timber rattlesnake. He needed some motivation to move off the trail and once he did I still gave him a wide berth of room. Creepy little creatures. 
I got to the shelter about 5:15 and something didn’t feel right about the personalities there so I pushed on another 3 miles to a tent site that’s located on a ridge. I’m homesick for my family and our normal July 4th activities. It’s not helping that in many places out over the valleys below I can hear fireworks going off. I can also hear a few that God put together in the distance. Happy that I’ll be seeing my family this weekend.

Another tough goodbye with Susan then I headed north and disappeared into the woods. One of the things that surprised us as we were driving around the area yesterday was the number of swampy bog-like areas we saw. Cattails included. Add in a warmer than normal string of days in a row and the combination resulted in high humidity. Hiking along a slow moving Housatonic River and it also created a breeding sanctuary for mosquitoes! I had to stop 5 minutes in and thoroughly spray myself with Deet enriched bug spray. Soon after I got my bug net out and ended up hiking most of the day using the net over my head. Truly understand my they’re called pests!
After the time off trail it was a bit of a struggle getting back into a groove. Actually, I didn’t find it today as the hike was a struggle so multiple breaks and hydration were needed along the way. The hydration was an issue because most the water sources was water coming out of bogs so a little iffy. Thankful again for trail angels because at one road crossing someone had left 8 gallons of bottled water. The hospitality of strangers is always appreciated. I did meet my first SOBO hikers that started in Maine last month. They’ll be finishing the trail in Georgia about the same time I do so I’m likely to see them again. Got to the “new” South Mt.

I had to put on my hat and cover my head with the bug net to have any chance for sleep. I could still hear the little blood suckers circling in for the aerial bombardment but they scored no kills. I’m officially renaming the state Mosquitochusetts!! With a 16 mile day in front of me I was out of the bunk at first light and on the trail by 6am. Trekking through this area of forest you pass by numerous stone fences that were once land boundary lines of long forgotten property owners. I can’t help but wonder about the people who built the fences and what the lives of the settlers was like. My guess is simple but challenging. At one point I took a break at what’s called the Shaker Campsite. It’s the remains of what was once a Shaker village with only a few foundation stones remaining. This is the third time I’ve gone through what was once a thriving community that has just disappeared. It makes you wonder. Soon after my break I came to a road crossing and saw a sign that said “AT Trail Stand”. Out in the middle of rural MA next to a farm was a self-serve oasis of cold drinks, candy, chips and cookies. Trail heaven! Sitting around a picnic table with several other hikers I had 3 Pepsi’s, chips and a Gatorade!
Semi-refreshed I pushed on into the afternoon. The heat and humidity continued to the point that I was sweat soaked from my hat to the bottom of my socks. Several hours, many breaks and 3-4 liters of water later I arrived at Upper Goose Pond Cabin. Got the rules and regulations from the caretaker’s 7 year old daughter, dropped my pack, put on my camp shoes then headed to the lake and jumped in. It was amazing!!
The water was refreshing and I was able to thoroughly rinse out my clothes. After changing into my dry clothes I fixed dinner and was ready for bed. There’s 14 of us on site tonight not counting the caretaker and her 3 kids so the likelihood of snoring is real but an enclosed cabin means no mosquitoes which should equate to better sleep. The other great thing about staying here is the caretaker makes coffee and cooks pancakes for all the hikers in the morning. Amazing!

I decided to sacrifice some of my phones battery to turn on some white noise. In went the headphones and along came the sleep. Not having mosquitoes buzzing around my head was also most excellent! Despite planning to zero here due to the pending storms there was no sleeping in as 75% of the hikers were pushing on so they were up early and packing. Also, the caretaker had the coffee ready at 6:15 with the pancakes following at 6:30. I’m told you don’t want to show up at 6:50 or the pancakes can be scarce!As the others trickled out to the trail the 4 of us staying behind kicked back in the rockers sipping on another hot cup. We helped with some of the daily chores which includes taking 35 empty galllon jugs down to the lake, putting them in a canoe, paddling to the other side where there’s a spring to fill them then bringing them back. No running water and no electricity in this rustic Berkshire Mountain cabin. The cooking is all done from propane gas tanks that also have to be canoed over from the other side of the lake. A simple but effective system for this seasonal cabin.About 10am we could hear thunder in the  distance and about 11am the promised storms arrived with hard winds, rain coming down in sheets, lighting and thunder. A wise choice to stay inside where it was dry and warm. About 1:30 the first soaked-to-the-bone hiker arrived on the large front deck dripping wet. Five or six soon followed so the caretaker started a fire in the large stone fireplace to knock some of the chill and moisture out of the air inside the lower floor of the cabin. I never would have thought that the heat from a fireplace in mid-July would have felt as good as it did. It’s mesmerizing and calming to sit in a rocking chair and stare into the glow of a fire which many of us did, off and on, until well after hiker midnight.It was a relaxing and educational day talking with the hikers that have done the northern sections still in front of me. To the point of being a bit annoying I asked about strategies they used for the White Mountains, the 100 Mile Wilderness and climbing the summit of Mt. Katadin. Every question was willingly answered with a sense of pride. Hikers always seem willing and generous.The cabin is full again tonight and with the off and on showers or rain droplets falling from the trees onto the metal roof it’ll hopefully ease all of us into a good night of sleep. As long as you were inside it was a good day...no rain and no mosquitoes. They are relentless!Life’s good. Be safe.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597684,"After the hikers left yesterday I switched bunks to be by one of the screen windows so the cool breeze coming in off the lake (it got down to 49) made for a great night of sleep. It also helped to dilute the funky smell in the room from unshowered hikers. Got out of the bunk early and headed down to the lake to enjoy a quiet time and watch the sun rise over the surrounding mountains. It was beautiful for about 27 seconds until I stopped moving. Then the mosquitoes found me and tranquility quickly turned into trotting back to the Cabin. Guess I was the fresh breakfast meat of the morning. After another fabulous hot pancake breakfast I said my thanks to the caretaker and her kids and started hiking. The only word I can think of to describe the conditions is flawless...except the mosquitoes. After the weather front came through the temps are low, humidity is low and the trail is in good condition. I expected it to be muddy from the rain but it wasn’t. The terrain was also favorable. All this resulted in a 20 mile day which is a personal best.
About mid-morning I stopped for a break beside Finety Pond and just didn’t want to leave. The sky was a beautiful blue, a steady wind was crisp and kept the bugs away and the water was crystal clear. It was incredible and peaceful. After 30 minutes I had to pushed and after an uneventful morning got to a shelter where I ate lunch. Took about 45 minutes to relax and enjoy but I still had another 8 miles before I got to my planned shelter stop for the night so had to go. For sometime now I’ve heard about a woman that lives just off this section of trail that bakes chocolate chip cookies and gives them to hikers that knock on her door. She’s affectionately known as the Cookie Lady. So I went by, knocked and sure enough I got two cookies. She also grows blueberries and I was able to enjoy a handful. It was a real treat and I got to meet a trail legend. Nice experience.
The day way getting late and as I got to the cut off for the shelter I realized it was only 2.5 more miles to get into Dalton and real food. After a 2 second discussion with myself I headed down the hill towards civilization. Despite being stopped at a railroad crossing by an exceptionally long train I made it into town with plenty of sunlight left. There’s a trail angel that lets hikers tent in his backyard so I pitched the tent then walked to a restaurant. Along the way I passed an ice cream shop so had a chocolate milkshake appetizer before I got to the restaurant and had my foot long meatball sub, chips and quart of chocolate milk! It hit the spot.
Today I passed 800 miles on the trail. That leaves only 1400 flip flopping and leap frogging miles to go!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597802,"It was a cool, quiet night tenting in the neighborhood backyard and a great night of sleep. My intention today was to have a late start to the hike with a couple “to do” items on my list. With the dew covering everything I needed to let the tent dry out before packing it up so I left it standing and walked into town. A proper shower (not a soak in a pond) was available at the Dalton community center so I walked down and enjoyed a hot shower with real soap and a towel for drying. Beats drip drying or drying off with my “do” rag wash cloth. Refreshed I walked across the street to the bakery and reflexed for awhile with a couple danishes and coffee. It was nice to be feeling normal.Headed back to the tent hostel and packed up my gear then hit the trail that actually goes through Dalton via several roads. Another hiker I’ve been seeing for several days, Songbird, started with me. We stopped at a convenience store for a couple hot dogs, drinks and trail snacks then got back on trail. With a late start the goal was to get to the next town of Cheshire to tent in the side yard of a church there. As a young, stronger hiker once we got into the trees Songbird was gone. For me it was a fairly straightforward hike with the highlight being Gore Pond. This is a beautiful area of water that is a beaver pond with several beaver lodges visible. Being remote it was quiet with the only noises being the natural sounds of the forest and pond. It would have been a relaxing spot to stop for a long break except for the Massachusetts state “bird” swarming around me. The pond made for another excellent breeding facility for the little pests so I snapped several pictures and moved on.Cheshire is a very small town that the trail goes through with little to offer but does have the church for tenting. Coming into town there’s a small snack shop that makes a darn good chocolate milk shake that I enjoyed in the shade of their picnic table. Sitting there with a SOBO hiker, Cheddar (from Wisconsin), a car drove up and the driver came over. She had been doing trail magic farther up the trail and offered us some goodies. The kindness of strangers on the trail still amazes me! We finished our snacks then walked to the church where Songbird was already setup for the night so we did the same. We headed to THE restaurant in town about a 15 minute walk away, enjoyed an excellent meal then walked back to the church. It was getting late so into the tents we went for hopefully another good night of sleep. It had been a short hiking day after yesterday’s 20 miler but I was tired and ready for bed. Tomorrow will be a climb up and over Mount Greylock which is the highest point in Massachusetts. Something to look forward to...Life’s good! Be safe.","Dalton, MA

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597804,"Another beautiful morning started the day after some great sleep in the tent. The three of us had to once again get the sun to dry the heavy dew off our gear so there wasn’t a crack of dawn start to the hike.  After some breakfast we packed up and left. When the trail got to the edge of town I needed a few things at the store just down the road so I said my goodbyes to Songbird knowing it was unlikely that I’d see him again with his speed. I got my supplies and headed back to the trail to start the long uphill trek to the summit of Mount Greylock. It would be about 7 miles of generally uphill hiking with an elevation gain of 2500’ so not too challenging. The cooler temps and conditions helped but I still had to take many breaks along the way. As with yesterday, nothing remarkable along the way just beautiful conifer and hardwood forests with the occasional bog or beaver pond for good measure. And it was beautiful! Stopped at a shelter for lunch and a short break plus to sign the shelter log and was on my way. I got to the top about 1:30 and as the highest point in Massachusetts the breeze at the top was cool and steady. There’s a hotel at the top called the Bascom Lodge that was built in the 30’s by the CCC with a restaurant and snack bar. Needing fluid I bought a few 12 ounce cans of Coke...$2.50 each!! They were good but not that good(aren’t monopolies great!). I enjoyed the break by sitting near the 100’ high war memorial that’s at the peak and looking out over the 360 degree views of the valleys below. After about 30 minutes it was time to move on. As I was starting down the hill I passed a young lady and we both recognized each other. Her trail name is Thumper and she met Furnace and I at Pine Grove Furnace State Park in PA. She’d also had some medical issues and was heading SOBO now. After about 15 minutes we went on our way and down the mountain I started.
Most the way were areas of minimal descent but some areas were steep. Those are the spots that make my knees start grumbling to my brain. I got to the intended shelter and there was just too much light left so I kept going toward the town of Williamstown not knowing where I’d be staying. I finally got into town about 6:30pm and started making phone calls to find a room. That was the easy part. The hotel with the vacancy was 2.5 miles away so I started street walking. I stopped in a grocery store for some chocolate milk and snacks then as I was leaving a women asked if I needed a ride. Trail magic from a trail angel! She dropped me off at the hotel and saved me about 2 miles of hoofing it. I told her the area needed more shuttle drivers as there are none listed which intrigued her. She agreed to pick me up in the morning to find out more about the shuttle opportunity which also meant I’d have a ride back to the trail head. Amazing!
So after a tough hiking day I was at the hotel. Since the hotel didn’t offer laundry I had to wash my clothes in the bathtub and hope they’d be dry in the morning. At least part of the funk would be gone. Had my shower, ate my snacks, hung my clothes to dry and got in bed. It had been a good day.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597940,"A great night of sleep in a big, soft bed was amazing. I took another hot shower because I could, put on my damp clothes and waited for my ride. She showed up on time and with a breakfast sandwich. A great start to a sunny and cool day! She drove me to the trail head and we talked about what hikers look for in a shuttle service and hostel with all the pros/cons.  Hope it’s something she pursues because it’ll be great for future thru hikers.
We said goodbye and I headed up the steep trail. It wasn’t 10 minutes and I met Shadow and Mountain Goat. This is a retired couple I’d met at Upper Goose Pond Cabin. They have two cars and are shuttling north along the trail in sections but always hiking south. It’s a good plan because you always know in 3-5 days you’ll have access to a vehicle. We talked for a couple minutes then went on our way knowing it was highly likely we’d meet again. The morning was cool, sunny and windy but my little flying “friends” were still a constant bother. I applied my now favorite Deet scented cologne which seemed to do the trick..until it sweated off, then I have to reapply. Hiking through this area I’ve noticed the trail hazard challenge is more roots than rocks from the erosion due to overuse of the trail. It’s just an observation but one that would bite me later in the day. After about 4 miles I crossed the state line into Vermont. Goodbye Mosquitochusetts! Starting at this point the AT and the Long Trail over lap for about 105 miles. The Long Trail’s northern terminus is the US/Canada line and was part of the inspiration for the AT. Hiking along I’d noticed a transition in the surrounding forest to more boulders littering the landscape with logs,boulders and trees having a partial covering of deep green moss. The forest floor also seems softer from the mix of conifer needles and crushed hardwood leaves. It’s been a subtle transition as I’m moving north but it’s what I’d expected to see with my prior travels to New England in a previous life. 
All was moving along as expected until I was started looking around instead of down and I stepped on one of those roots completely twisting my right ankle but fortunately didn’t fall. I sat down on the nearest rock and took inventory. Everything seemed fine so I kept going. It wasn’t 2 hours later and it happened again but this time I went down hard. It started feeling like Pennsylvania again only the hazard was roots instead rocks! In some pain I kept hiking knowing that once I stopped the ankle would start to get stiff but fortunately there was no swelling. I arrived at my shelter of choice late in the afternoon only to find it full. Between NOBO’s, SOBO’s and Long Trail hikers there are more people on the trail now so the shelters fill up quickly in the afternoons. I made the decision to push on and go to a motel in Bennington where at least I could ice the ankle. The road at the trailhead was at the bottom of a sharp descent into Woodford Hollow and when I got there it had been an 18 mile day. At least so far. With no cell service I couldn’t call a shuttle so started walking toward town with my thumb out but there were no takers. After about 3 miles I finally got a signal and called a taxi. As the final light of day was fading he picked me up and dropped me at the motel. I was exhausted.After some snacks and a shower I got the ice on the ankle then relaxed. Too much fun for one day but I’ve already decided to zero tomorrow to rest, ice and elevate.Life’s good. Be safe(again, safer than me!).","Williamstown, MA

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597941,"The zero started out with washing and drying all my clothes at about 5:30am. Went to have some breakfast then put on my best hiking clothes and went to the Christian Center Church in Bennington for their 9:30 service. Everything seemed normal with various parishioners welcoming me and making me feel at home despite the funny accent(theirs or mine?). The music started about 9:30am and it was a series of oldie but goodie acoustic praise songs. I say series because it was like a professional sports playoff series that keeps on going. Not to mention the jumping around and flag waving. Needless to say I was a bit out of my comfort zone with that but the music finally stopped about 10:25. The service transitioned to fellowship time and I swear they gave enough time for everyone in the sanctuary to say “hey” to everyone else. Finally, after announcements and the offering the preaching stared at 10:45. Five points that should have taken 20 minutes took 45 minutes. Get to the point man! Hard when you’re used to a efficient service with effective communications. But, here’s the kicker, there was one woman that accepted Christ as her Savior so while I was being a bit flustered the Holy Spirit was convicting a heart. I always love the line from the old hymn that says..”tho millions have come there’s still room for one..”. The kingdom got at least one new member in Bennington, VT this morning. It may not have been the service I was looking for or was accustomed to but it was a special service for one woman and for those us her salvation blessed.  Praise God!!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598272,Today was pretty much a boring day of laying around on the bed nursing the ankle and watching TV. I did make a Walmart run for a few supplies and to eat some lunch. The choice was Pizza Hut with an all your can eat buffet and I’m pretty sure they didn’t make any money off this customer!! I paid the bill and grabbed a couple slices of dessert pizza for the road. I got back to the motel and it hit me that I haven’t been having problems with mosquitoes. I talked to some of the other hikers there at the motel and they were of the same opinion. It was if magically when we got into Vermont the mosquitoes stopped. Don’t understand it and can’t explain it all I can do is report the facts. And a strange but satisfying fact it is!I’ll be heading to Friendly’s Restaurant in the morning for their half price breakfast  special then get back on the trail.

I walked back to the motel and the owner was able to take me back to the trail head about 10am. It’s a beautiful day, the pain is minimal and I’m ready yo hike. The climb out of the hollow was tough but not as severe an angle as the the climb down a couple days ago. The roots and rocks continued so I was more focused on looking down than up but could still see how beautiful the forest was. About 3 miles in I entered the Glastenbury Wilderness with a sign explaining that minimal trail work was done through this area to be within the wilderness guidelines. The deeper in I got the more damp, dense, dark and lush it became. It started looking less like Vermont and more like where the Jurassic Park movies were filmed. Instead of bears I started thinking about velociraptors! I saw several snakes but nothing that would eat me and after another 5 miles exited the wilderness. It’s an amazing area and I’m thankful for the vision someone(s) had to preserve it.The hike had a general uphill direction to it as the shelter I was heading for is near the peak of Glastenbury Mountain. When I got to the shelter I took one of the two remaining spots and got into my dry clothes. There was still plenty of sunshine and wind so I hung my sweat soaked clothes on some balsam tree branches to dry. I wasn’t the only one doing that so it looked like a bunch of Christmas tress partially decorated with colorful, stinky clothes. Not exactly a Hallmark moment!Settled in to my end-of-day routine as more hikers kept coming. By the time hikers midnight rolled around the shelter was at capacity and 7-8 tents were set up on flat spots in the surrounding forest. The wind continued to blow which kept it cool but we also knew the wind was on the front end of some  significant rain coming in the morning. But tonight I’m in a newer, mouse-free shelter laying in my sleeping bag which is on top of a flat air mattress. Somewhere there’s a really small hole that I can’t seem to find.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598310,"We woke up with the wind still blowing but instead of sunshine the shelter was in the clouds. With my ankle stiff it will make my pace a little slower and with the rain coming I decided to only go about 4-5 miles to the next shelter. Had my breakfast of a frosted honeybun and a cup of Carnation Instant Breakfast mixed with powdered milk(it’s about as bad as it sounds but it’s just add water!) then packed up and headed out. I made it to the shelter about 9:30 and was conflicted. There was strong cell reception so I could get a radar image to see where the rain was. My head said stay but once again my ego said go. Should have listened to my head. I got back on trail thinking I had just enough time to go the 4.8 miles before the rain hit. Missed it by 45 minutes. Unfortunately in that 4.8 miles I had 3 falls on wet roots prior to the rain. Tne first fall was just your basic embarrassing variety but not the other two. Another right ankle roll with a hard fall(seems like with the law of averages my left ankle would get a “turn”). I laid there in the wet bushes analyzing the pain and determined it was OK. It wasn’t long after that my right foot slipped on a root and I went down hard on other roots landing on my lower back just below the end of my backpack. The pain of the impact made me yell and I just laid there in the muck on the trail not wanting to move. After several minutes I was able to get up and slowly proceed. There is pain with each step but I made it to the shelter soaked and hurting but thankful to be out of the rain.
It made for a long afternoon and evening. With my uninflatable mattress I knew it was going to be a uncomfortable night. Hopefully in the morning I’ll see an improvement but regardless I’ve made plans to be picked up in the morning after a very short hike out. God Drop, a hiker friend I met on the AT last year, is in the immediate area doing volunteer work on the AT and Long Trail and has offered to pick me up. I’ll be heading to Manchester Center to check into a hostel and contemplate my next move. Also I have a mail drop needing to be picked up that Susan sent me.

Plus we were packed in like sardines so every time I rolled over I felt like I was bumping into the hiker next to me. The soothing part of the night was the sound of rain on the roof of the shelter. Always so peaceful. There were no thunderstorms with the weather to break the peace although the snoring was a close substitute. I wasn’t meeting God Drop until 9am so I stayed still in my bag as long as I could. The back, the knee, the ankle, oh my! Every hiker experiences pain but typically once we get up and start moving around it’s like the WD-40 in our body kicks in and the pain goes below a tolerable level. That seemed to be the case with the knee and ankle(although it’s still stiff) but not the lower back. I got my gear together and started the two mile hike to the rendezvous point to meet God Drop. It was a quick realization that with each step, especially going uphill, that there was a low level of pain. About 10 minutes into the hike I met God Drop who decided to hike into the forest to meet me. We talked a few minutes then headed to the gravel road where his truck was parked. It was great to see him again and we got caught up as we hiked along. The lush forest of the Green Mountains around us is beautiful but with the rain the trail under our feet is mostly mud, muck and wet roots so the going was a bit slow. I was a little apprehensive and tentative which added to the slow pace. It wasn’t long until we were at his truck and heading to town looking forward to a great breakfast. We went by the post office then the hostel for me to check in plus get a shower. The Hiker Breakfast on the menu looked amazing and we weren’t disappointed. After we went by the outdoor supply store where they helped me with my bent hiking pole(from the back fall). Now I’m back at the hostel sitting on a heating pad and chilling. Hopefully after a couple days God Drop and I will have an opportunity to hike more than just the two miles we did today. But first I need to know the back is OK. He was a great help today which was muchly appreciated. 
Several of us pitched in with one of the hikers here and she’s going to cook an Italian dinner for all of us tonight. It should be excellent! So the next 36 hours will be rest and heat on the backside.  I’d elevate if I could but can’t figure out how.

Today has been simultaneously relaxing and frustrating but taking the zero was a necessary evil. The hostel owner did shuttle hikers the short distance into town where I took care of a couple items. The resupply list was minimal as the hiker box here has quite an assortment of food items donated by other hikers. I also took the opportunity while in town to get a haircut which took place at another real barber shop. It’s a little shorter than I like but that will feel cooler while hiking. It still amazes me that when I ask for about a quarter inch to be cut off it ends up being about a half inch. Maybe she didn’t understand the accent or a quarter inch translates differently in Vermont. Oh well, this too will grow back. After a stop at the donut shop I decided to walk the mile or so back to the hostel to see how my backside would do and it was OK. Just kind of chilled the rest of the day.
God Drop dropped by about 5ish and we discussed the hiking plans for the next several days before going to dinner. Tomorrow will be a tester for my various pain points as we hike over the top of Stratton Mountain which is an elevation gain of 1700’.

The last couple days I’ve been trying to figure out where the hole is in my air mattress so I can get those kind of nights sleep on the trail. I’ve inflated it then submerged it in a bath tub but no bubbles. I’ve sprayed the individual air cells with soapy water but no bubbles. I’ve inflated it, folded it then but a heavy object on it over night and it was still inflated. I’m bumfuzzled. So tonight with a recovering pain in my back I’ve inflated the mattress and am hopeful of it staying aired up. We’ll see. The movement from today’s hike seemed to help relieve the pain in the bone of my upper butt crack and I also noticed my right ankle isn’t as stiff. All good news(thanks for your prayers). 
It was raining when I woke up but by the time God Drop got there to pick me up the sky was blue and the wind felt cooler. A quick stop by McDonalds and we were on our way. After a 40 minute ride we put on our packs and started out to climb Stratton Mountain. It was a gradual 1700’ rise over the 3.5 miles to the summit through beautiful conifer forests, over large moss covered rocks, across several swollen streams from the rains and many mini-streams coming onto and then down the trail. These mini-streams mixed with the black muck already there creating some serious trail soup. We skipped from rock to rock trying to keep our feet dry but it was a losing proposition. So with wet shoes, socks and feet we hiked on. The summit has an old fire tower and the 360 degree views were amazing! Also on top was an old care takers warming cottage thats been seasonally operating since 1929. Very cool. The other thing about Stratton Mountain is that this is the summit where Benton MacKaye got the inspiration for the Appalachian Trail. Another very cool! With storms approaching we descended the north side of the mountain for the short 2.8 miles to the shelter. There were a couple people there so we quickly marked our territory then ate a late lunch. As the rain approached the shelter filled up with a diverse group oh hikers. The younger group was full of energy and excitement as they are getting closer to Katahdin. Or maybe the energy and excitement was coming from the marijuana being smoked(legal in Vermont). Either way they were enjoying themselves. The rest of the 30 something’s and above just went about their normal routine while inhaling deeply(that’s a joke). Anyway, it’s hikers midnight and the conversation is still going strong but those or us “blue hairs” are in our bags ready for sleep.

It was a good, cool night and miraculously my air mattress stayed inflated making for better shelter sleep. We took our time getting ready then started up the trail. We quickly came to the beautiful Stratton Pond. It was another one of those moments when you just wanted to sit down and contemplate the beauty of the Creation. Amazing! As we moved on the terrain and muck made me realize the multiple sites of pain in my body were still talking to me. Hiking on I was requiring more and longer rest stops. As a stronger hiker I was really appreciating God Drop’s patience with me. As we got to the last shelter before a major road crossing into Manchester I knew there wasn’t another significant mountain up and down left in my knees. We talked for a long while and I made the decision to stop for the day, go into town and take a strong reality check of my situation. God Drop and I said our goodbyes(for now) and he went on up the trail. I stayed at the shelter for quit awhile just sitting and praying. I finally started down the hill hiking the last 3 miles to the road with the pressure of every step making the various points of joint pain letting me know what they thought. At the road crossing I was fortunate to quickly get a ride into town then checked into a hotel. It was the end of an impactful 10 mile day. 
Part 2
After talking with Susan about various scenarios it was obvious that pushing on into the toughest elevations of the AT for the next 538 miles wasn’t my best choice. If my knees, right ankle and lower back were talking to me now they’d be screaming at me from here to Maine if I continued north at this point. I also did the math and with my current, low daily miles it was going to be iffy to make it to Katahdin before they closed the mountain for the season. So reluctantly I decided that Manchester is as far north as I’d hike the AT...this year.  My plan now is to rest my body in Manchester for a few days then take a bus back to Great Barrington where I’ll start heading south to finish a 195ish mile section down to New Jersey I’d previously skipped over. Then I’ll jump down to Daleville, VA to complete the southern section starting about September 1st.
It’s been an emotional time but the decision to change course is the right one. God put those pain receptors in me for a reason and I’m going to listen to what they’re telling me. Once I’ve completed everything south of here I’ll have hiked 1637 miles leaving 538 miles for next year. There’s still a ways to go for this year and all I have to do is keep putting one foot in front of the other...

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598947,Today was spent having mixed feelings about my decision to head south and not complete the AT in a single season. I kept thinking that if I rest a few days the pains will subside and I’ll be good to go on tackling the sections north of me. But then I walk up a short flight of stairs slowly and painfully which reinforces my decision. I know there are many elevation challenges still to be faced heading south but I won’t have the clock ticking loudly in my head to get to a place like Mt. Katahdin before it’s closed for the season. It’s still fresh and hard for me to accept that with this change I won’t be considered a thru hiker but I know that one day I’ll have the satisfaction of being able to say I’ve hiked the entire AT.I moved from the hotel today over to the Green Mountain House Hostel. Jeff and Duffy run this place and do a great job catering to all hikers plus it’s a reasonable rate. I’ll spend a couple days here resting and making plans for how to get to Great Barrington. Life’s good! Be safe.,"Manchester, VT

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599452,"After a good night of sleep I'm still questioning my decision to some degree.  After two years of planning and preparation it's hard to accept but deep inside where we make those kind of hard decisions I know the redirect is what I need to do. Listen to the head and not the ego.  The Green Mountain House provides all the elements needed for a great pancake and egg breakfast so all the hikers took advantage.  The hikers staying there consumed three dozen eggs and countless pancakes plus about 6 large bowls of cereal.  Need those calories! The shuttles to the trailhead were loaded leaving only a couple of us behind who were taking zeros.  My morning was spent making arrangements to get back to Great Barrington via the bus.  About 10:30am I got an email from God Drop about having lunch together. It was good to see him again and he brought two friends he'd met that were care takers for the AMC at various spots along the AT.  We had good conversation about trail issues during lunch then said our goodbyes.  With my decision to be southbound there were several items of cold weather clothing I didn't need to be carrying so walked to the post office to send them back to Hickory. The rest of the afternoon and evening was spent talking with the other hikers about their experiences and watching hiking videos.  Hiker's midnight still seems to be a real thing even in hostels so it was early to bed.  Tomorrow I'll be on an early bus heading south to continue my journey.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599453,"The bus was coming through town just after 7am so I had an early start to the day.  Had breakfast and packed up then Jeff took me to the bus stop.  After a couple of bus changes I made it to Great Barrington by late morning, checked into the Days Inn and rested for the remainder of the day.  I did go see the new Mission Impossible movie that wasn't exactly realistic(ya think!) but it was entertaining. Got back to the room and reorganized my pack for hitting the trail in the morning. It's been a restful day and I'm hoping that being off trail the last couple days will be what I needed to be able to press on in the morning.Life's good!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599458,"It's a beautiful morning heading out the door of the hotel.  I needed some resupply and the store was on the way to the trailhead so I started road walking south.  Got what I needed then finished my 2.5 mile walk to get to the trail.  Took a right at the trailhead, covered myself with Deet(I am back in Mosquitochusetts!) and started the next phase of my hike.  The terrain was flat with this section of the trail being in the Housatonic River Valley. The river itself would normally have been a great source of water but without significant filtration capabilities in my backpack there were signs up saying it was best not to use it for drinking.  Up river were too many textile and industrial manufacturing companies that over the decades had utilized the river for their process discharge and the lingering impacts were still present. Not to mention the cattle farms along the way. It's unfortunate because it's a beautiful, lazy flowing river but I didn't want body parts to start falling off so I took heed of the signs and moved on.  I knew that at some point the trail would have to climb out of the valley and that the test for how my body would perform would be these ups then the downs.  So up we went and it didn't take me long to realize my few days of rest hadn't been enough.  I pushed on into a steep part of the trail that goes up a rock face where I put the poles away and was grabbing rock for hand holds.  It wasn't a long section that was like this but it was unexpected.  The rewarded at the top was a magnificent view of the valley where I sat for a long time enjoying the view and doing body inventory.  After the long rest I hiked on, hit another short rock scramble and finally was hiking along the rocky ridge of the western side of the valley. At any meaningful elevation hiking along a mountain ridge is rewarded with views off both sides and today was no exception.  At this point my body was once again talking to me with a raised voice so I was taking my time with each step.  I got to another steep rock face that was slick from water runoff of rains from yesterday and started up.  About halfway up my right foot slipped out from under me and down the rock face I went. It wasn't my  hardest fall I'd experienced but it was enough.  My left arm was scrapped up, another hiking pole was bent but most importantly my cell phone was shattered.  After a long break I picked a different route up this section of trail hiking on until I reached my destination by early afternoon.
It was at this point, while sitting down and eating a late lunch that I decided I needed more that a few days off the trail for my body to be able to continue.  My body ached(which was expected) but my right ankle, both knees and lower back hurt. Also my primary method of communications was broken keeping me from seeing my trail maps, my radar for weather and for talking with the ""outside"" world. I made the decision I was going back to Great Barrington via a side trail that led to a hiway, I'd thumb a ride back to town, check into the hotel I left this morning then I'd head back to Hickory for 2-3 weeks to recover.  This would also allow me to get the phone fixed.  Fortunately, I had the Garmin in my pack that was a retirement gift from Hanes because texting on this via satellite was now my only means of communications.  So I hiked out to the road and was quickly picked up by a gentleman that was heading to Great Barrington.  The hotel had space so I checked in, took a wonderful shower(had one this morning before I left but they always feel great!) and started trying to figure out how I was getting back to Hickory. To rent a car through Enterprise to drop in Hickory would have been ""all in"" at about $875 but a Greyhound bus was only $180. Being the frugal person that I am it looked like I'd be ""enjoying"" a 22 hour bus ride tomorrow!
With this one day of hiking I've officially hit the 900 mile mark in my now disjointed journey! Another milestone with many more to reach in due time.
Coming back to Hickory is really going to throw a kink in my plans but at this point the body pain is greater than the joy and satisfaction that I'm getting from being on trail. So taking another extended break in Hickory with Susan and Daisy is the plan.  The last fall and the breaking of the cell phone made it an easy decision. So for tonight another night of sleep in a hotel room with a soft bed but tomorrow night I'll be sleeping on a bus seat while bumping down the interstate. I'm sure that'll be an adventure!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599467,"I slept in as late as possible knowing tonight I'd be on a bus.  After I got up I went through my food bag and laid out all the extra items I had on the bed.  Then I passed the word to the other thru hikers staying at the hotel that I was giving away hiker food.  It didn't take long before I had 4-5 people in my room scarfing up the goodies.  They were all appreciative and I was happy to help them out.  The rest of the day was used to eat, rest, eat a little more and get ready for the 5:10pm to Hickory.  Actually, it was scheduled to go through several small towns while on the way to NYC, Richmond, Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, WS, Statesville finally arriving in Hickory tomorrow at 2:30pm.  As the time approached I headed to the bus stop which fortunately had an overhand because the Great Barrington area went on a flash flood warning while I was waiting.  Thunder and lightening, black clouds, wind and heavy rain went on for quite awhile and of course the bus was 30 minutes late.  I wasn't too wet and was thankful to get on the bus. So off we went.  I'd like to tell you the journey was delightful but I'd be lying.  For those of us who have traveled extensively on planes we complain about not having enough leg room.  Well, ride a Greyhound for 22 hours and you'll think the leg room on the plane is spacious! The terminals and stations offer minimal services at best although I did enjoy a chicken salad sandwich for dinner while patiently waiting for a delayed bus in NYC.  Then for breakfast in Richmond I went with a hot dog that had been terminally spinning on the stainless steel rollers for who knows how long. I figured the water I've been drinking for the last several months had conditioned my system for any bacteria so what did I have to lose?  Fortunately there were no adverse effects other than a tremendous case of heartburn.  Most of the other stations only had vending machines if they had anything at all.  The sleep was off and on during the trip and when I finally did arrive in Hickory I was tired but excited to see Susan waiting for me at the bus stop(a gas station at the corner of Fairgrove Church and Hiway 70). 
And so ends this part of my journey.  I'll start back on the trail in 2-3 weeks but will likely be hiking the section between Hot Springs, NC and Daleville, VA.  Those plans aren't set yet but I have time. The trail isn't going anywhere.
Thanks again for following along and for all the prayers. I can't imagine what kind of shape I'd be in if not for the prayers.  They are much appreciated.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600424,Just updating where I am in the process. Been going to my chiropractor for treatment on my lower back last week and will continue this week. There’s been improvement but I’m not yet pain free. In the meantime the knees and ankle  are also feeling better so I’m getting anxious to get restarted. Since I’m no longer a spring chicken the healing process takes longer so I need to be sure the ego doesn’t get in the way of doing the right thing...again. My best guess is I’ll be heading back out the middle of next week. Right now the plan would be using Hot Springs as my starting point likely having Bluff Mountain Outfitters shuttle services taking me to a point north of town then I’ll hike southbound back towards Hot Springs. This will once again give me an opportunity to see how the body does on a limited basis before heading back out for a longer time period. But for now I’m enjoying being at home in Hickory spending time with family and friends. Life’s good. Be safe.,"Hickory, NC

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602061,"After several weeks of treatment on my lower back I'm ready to hit the trail.  I'm not 100% pain free but then that's probably my new reality.  So tomorrow Susan and I will caravan to Hot Springs to drop my vehicle then we'll head to Sam's Gap where she'll drop me off.  The hike back to Hot Springs is only 44 miles with plenty of up and down terrain to let me know how my body's going to respond.  The weather is supposed to be drier this week so hopefully that'll help me stay upright!  If all goes as planned then I'll decide where I'm going next with the goal of completing the 525 unhiked AT miles south of Daleville, VA before the end of this season. My trail buddy from earlier in the hike, Furnace, has completed the northern section of his flip-flop and is currently southbound knocking out miles in Virginia.  We've been in communication and would like to see about hooking up again but I don't want my ""new"" trail legs to slow him down as he's starting to smell the finish line at Springer. Hopefully it'll work out.
The time off has been beneficial. Spending time with Susan and Daisy has been great plus it's given me time with ChristPHER and Ali.  Pre-back injury DanIEL was scheduled to be home so I got the rare opportunity to spend time with him. Can't take any of that for granted and really treasure the time with my family and our friends. The time off has also allowed the other hiking related ailments to improve with my hiker hobble all but gone(except when I walk with bare feet). Last, when I started this journey on April 7th, I knew I'd be sacrificing watching several early season Auburn University football games which was a bummer. But being home I did get to see the first game of the regular season which was a big win over a higher ranked team.  We'll see many more wins this year but I especially want the last game of our regular season to be another win against a higher ranked team.  War Eagle!!!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602143,"After 4+ weeks off the trail it was good to start hiking again. Susan and I were a mini-convoy heading west out of Hickory about high noon today. After stopping in Black Mountain for lunch at Veranda Cafe(one of our favorites) we headed over to Hot Springs and dropped off my Escape. We drove up to Sam’s Gap where my beautiful shuttle driver let me out to start my southbound back to Hot Springs. After a few pictures and a goodbye I started walking down the road, under the I-26 overpass then up into the woods. Maybe two minutes later it started a hard rain but it didn’t last long so I was finally back at the quest. It was a planned short day and about an hour later I arrived at the shelter.
So far all the body parts are working with only my left foot objecting to the hike. After the late afternoon storms it’s a beautifully calm, cool night with the frogs and crickets singing their songs. Technically I’m by myself in the shelter if you don’t count the mice. It’s only 8:30pm and I can already hear them scurrying over the wooden beams above and beside me. It’s the sound that is bothersome so I may have to put in the ear plugs so I can sleep. It’s all part of the AT journey but a mouse trap or two would really be nice! Don’t tell PETA.
I’m looking forward to the next few days as I evaluate my body’s trail worthiness. So far it’s looking positive but regardless of the outcome I’ll enjoy the time I’m out here on the trail. It’s after hikers midnight so it’s time for sleep. Bet the mice don’t now that!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602918,"September 4th was to be a 10 mile second day of my trial hike but things didn’t go as planned. After a restless night of sleep I woke up with elevated pain in both feet but opted to push on with the thought that the pain level would subside as the feet “stretched” out some. You know, walk it off. With multiple breaks it took me 4.5 hours to cover 6 miles of reasonable terrain which isn’t a good indicator of things to come. At this point the trail crosses NC 212 just yards from the NC/TN line. A couple years ago I arranged to be dropped off here by Bluff Mountain Outfitters then I hiked back to Hot Springs so I knew this was one of only a couple pick up points along this section of the trail. Reluctantly I called Bluff Mountain and they put me in touch with a shuttle driver(Rachel) so I could be picked up. So my trial hike wasn’t the success I’d hoped for but it did net 9 more miles.I’m back in Hickory now (9/14) hobbling around, nursing my feet and watching Florence. I’m not sure when I’ll be back on trail but I’m targeting September 30. The plan would be cover as much of my unhiked southern portion of the trail as possible to salvage the season. But the bottom of my feet with absolutely dictate when I restart.In the meantime I’ll spend time with Susan, Daisy, family and friends, absorb the endless coverage of Hurricane Florence, watch as many of my beloved Auburn Tigers football games as possible  and rest my feet. My thoughts and prayers are with the people being impacted by Florence. For most the hikers on the AT that will be inconvenienced by the heavy rain it’s going to be a temporary event. But for people living along the coast, in the flood  prone areas and in the steep mountain valleys it has the potential to be life altering. If they’re not already please put them all in your prayers.Life’s great!! Right now and for the next several days Be Safe.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603832,"The status of ""on hold"" translates to still not being back on the trail(duh?).  My goal was to be back on trail yesterday but the old saying about ""best laid plans"" kind of kicked in.  My painful feet had substantially recovered so I decided to be useful and work through our church with Samaritan's Purse in Jacksonville, NC about 10 days ago with hurricane clean-up.  While our team was clearing debris on a homeowner's property I was simply walking across their yard and something popped in my left foot. Ironic that I'd completed 900+ miles of the AT with its various slick, rocky, muddy, root dense terrains but then get a direct foot injury by walking across a level, manicured yard.  The pain was acute and the swelling started immediately.  After Monday x-rays and evaluations the verdict was a partial tear in a tendon that starts on the outside of the foot at the cuboid bone and goes over the top of the foot just below the ankle.  All that translates to wearing a black, knee-high, designer non-hiking boot for 2-3 weeks before considering any more AT miles.  Given that I'm currently on a lengthy recovery hiatus since coming off trail I'll also have to ""train"" for two weeks post-compression boot before hitting the trail.  So at this point it's looking like the 4th week of October before I can get back out and cover some miles.  I'll focus on the 195 miles from Damascus to Hot Springs before Thanksgiving then maybe the 106 mile section from Franklin to Springer after that if the weather is cooperative. That's my plan but like Proverbs says Someone else directs my steps! 
I want to give a shout out to a couple of my trail buddies.  Bamadog completed his thru hike journey summiting Katahdin several weeks ago and I assume is getting back to a ""normal"" life with his beloved wife in Alabama. The timing of finishing was great since this also lets him watch University of Alabama football games every Saturday while he recovers from the hike.  A hearty ""Roll Tide""(did I say that?)and praise the Lord goes out to you, my friend!  One of my flip-flop buddies, Furnace, has less than 100 miles to go as he speeds toward Springer. Please check out his Trail Journals site and the link as he's trying to raise money for a young boy that needs a new liver. Hats off to you and watch out for low hanging limbs!!

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606131,"This will be my last entry for the 2018 season.  It's been a couple months since my last entry given I really haven't had anything new to report.  The left foot has seen much improvement and I finished my last physical therapy session on my lower back the week before Christmas.  I've gone through all my equipment and replaced my REI Flash air mattress due to inflation(or lack thereof) issues plus my silk liner since it had a large rip.  The focus now is getting back into pre-hike shape knowing from experience that it'll take a couple hundred actual miles on the trail to regain my trail legs.  
So now that I'm a section hiker my plan is to start in the Hot Springs area and head north to my original starting point in Daleville, VA.  At this point I'm targeting my restart to be sometime in early April but still TBD. 
I want to say congratulations to three hikers that I had the privilege of spending some trail time with this year:  Bamadog, Furnace and No Doubt.  All three of them completed their goal of becoming through hikers during 2018.  It was a pleasure and a blessing to have them as trail mates.  Also, I want to say thank you to all my friends who followed along with me on Trail Journals and for all the prayers that were raised up on my behalf.  My total number of falls for the 909 miles completed was a nice round 20(#19 was the hike ender) and I can't imagine how many more it would have been without the prayer coverage.  And last(should have been first!), I want to thank my beautiful and loving wife.  Without her love, prayers, support and understanding none of the miles would have been possible.  Susan, I love you!
So now I guess I'll need to start a new Trail Journals page for the 2019 miles.  See y'all next year!!","Hickory, NC
