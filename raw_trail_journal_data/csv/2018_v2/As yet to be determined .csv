As yet to be determined ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585140,"My official SOBO start date is about  months. I've been walking with base weight,  then added food. Just when do you get your ""trail legs""? Also to add to it,  when do your lungs stop screaming ever ascent? Looking forward to going on my walk and hoping by June,  I'll be somewhat trail ready.","

Legs turn to jello after about  3 hours.  Looking forward to getting in whatever condition I need to be in to get through this walk. Sleep system needs a little tweaking. Pack,  tent and clothing are ready to rock.  June is fast approaching,  looking forward to ""The Walk"".",,Three Caves,"Mar 31, Sat",9
As yet to be determined ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586231,"Two days straight,  no rain and dry(ish) trails.  I'm in nirvana. Battling the great deliema, to go with or without stove.  Oh, the decisions! None the less,  legs slowly building up,  lungs taking air easier, and equipment dialed in. Less than 2 months,  anxious to get under way.",,Green Mnt,"Apr 09, Mon",0
As yet to be determined ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586640,"Dry again for the most part,  love stepping on dirt and firm mud. Trying to increase my time(walking)  on the trail, what an absolute pain. Finding out I've got about 3 good hours in me before I start dragging hard. Got in 5 hours today = ~12.5 miles. Don't know if I should gloat or cry. Guess I'll take it and keep working.  Time is ticking away,  this whole walking thing needs to get easier, fast. Rain for the next 2 days, so somewhat unimproved roads for the first of next week (LNT ya know). Cheers and happy walking.",,View Entry,"Apr 13, Fri",0
As yet to be determined ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591008,"Will I ever feel like a million bucks after a walk?  Rocks were so wet, felt like a cross between Tia Chi and what has been described as landing a jet on a carrier deck.  Every move had to be either slow and deliberate or made so that when you land,  you can bound to another spot immediately.   Of course, the happy days of cool, breezy weather have been replaced with haze and humidity. Today's stroll sucked all the happy,  happy,  joy,  joy,  clean out of me. 16 days and its show time. Getting concerned about the type of show I'm going to provide.   No matters,  is all good. Doesn't have to be pretty, just get it done.",,Monte Sano State Park,"May 19, Sat",8
As yet to be determined ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593288,"After dealing with some issues at home, I missed my window for an entire thru hike.  To salvage at least part of my hike,  I drove to Harrisburg,  PA yesterday (12 long hours)  to start my walk at Duncannon,  PA today.  Next entry will be from the trail.",,Unknown ,"Jun 07, Thu",0
As yet to be determined ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593336,"Ok,  finally on the trail.  Started about 9:30 and was toast by 3:00. Something about 4  hours of sleep in the back of a Camry will do that I guess. Started off straight up a mnt,  then about 4 miles of rock (big,  little,  huge, you name it). Could get a normal stride going to save my life.  Came of the mnt and all was well,  except I was fairly trashed by then. Got to the shelter,  set up,  stretched,  cleaned up,  and took a nap.  The water source is about .25 miles down hill,  if I didn't enjoy water so much, I wouldn't bother. As of 6:45, I'm solo up here. A few day hikers,  but that's it. Bedtime isn't far off. Tomorrow is another day.","Duncannon, Pa

As yet to be determined ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593452,"Today,  I walked down a mnt, across and under roads, over interstate,  around corn and hay fields, thru Boiling Springs,  PA, up another mnt and ended up at the bottom of that mnt. I saw 2 deer,  2 ducks, 2 ground hogs(swear one was Punxsutawney Phil), more field mice, chipmunks and  squirrels than could be counted. I started at 7:20am and ended at 3:30pm. Today I made a decision,  no more than 15 mile/day. Too tough on my body at the end of the day and I'll get to see more sights if I slow up a bit. Looking forward to sleep and time of my feet. Water had been filtered,  dinner(such as it was) is done,  get this blurb submitted and I'm history for the day. More fun and excitement tomorrow.","Darlington Shelter

As yet to be determined ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593530,"Started out about 7:30 so I could go straight up a hill and into the ""rock maze"". It took some scrabbling, twisting and turning,  but after cheating (not completely following the trail),  I got thru unscathed.The rest of the day was mud in the morning and rocks galore in the afternoon.  By 3:30, I hobbled into and thru the park.  Found a hostel,  with a open bunk,  so here I will need down. Not feeling the love for the trail to be sure.  After 4 hours,  I don't walk,  it's more a limp mixed with a hobble.  Having issues eating as well,  I'll drink a bathtub full of water,  but eating isn't appealing.  Soaked my feet in a stream this am and they felt great,  till they thawed. Looking forward to see what tomorrow brings.","Kennedy Shelter

After a mile or so,  that was it.  Between the feet and hip,  I'm done for time being. Driving home,  going to visit my local medical establishment and get put back together,  assess what needs to be modified (my weight,  pack weight and footwear,  for example) and reboot this disaster for a second run. Thanks to all who showed interest.  I'll pick this catastrophe up  again at a later date.","Pine Grove Furnace
