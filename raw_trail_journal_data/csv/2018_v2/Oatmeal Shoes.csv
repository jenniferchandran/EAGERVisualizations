Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582656,"There are less than 6 weeks until my Dad and I start the approach trail at Amicalola Falls. We have our gear settled, and we are going on a shakedown hike soon. All I have left to do is to button down some last details for things I'm leaving behind. It's been difficult to make the decision to stop working and leave for several months. I know this trip is going to be worth it. This is something I've wanted to do for over 9 years, and it's pretty surreal to finally be making the first steps.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Sat",0
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584029,We left in a whirlwind after finishing up several projects. It was a late start and we stopped just out side St. Louis. The plan is to drive the rest of the way tomorrow and to stay at the Amicalola falls lodge.,,View Entry,"Mar 12, Mon",0
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584085,After a long day of driving we made it the Amicalola falls lodge. The view is amazing. I didn't realize that the lodge was at the top of the falls and that tomorrow I'm going to the bottom to climb back up. The first day of hiking will be the approach trail to the Springer mountain shelter. I've already read some horror stories about the 609 stairs of the approach trail. It will be an experience either way.,,View Entry,"Mar 13, Tue",0
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584174,What an intense day. We hiked 9 miles from Amicalola falls visitor center to Springer mountain shelter. 609 stairs was a interesting way to start the hike. We took a few breaks and made it with out too much trouble. That combined with the rest of the trail could go down as one of the most physically demanding things I've done. As I'm writing this I'm laying in my tent trying not to move too much because my legs are angry and cramp at the slightest movement. The plan for tomorrow is a hopefully easy 7 miles to hawk mountain camp site.,"

Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584247,"I didn't have any signal last night at Hawk mountain camp ground. Yesterday had a good amount of climbs. The campground we stayed at was amazing. 30 tent pads going down the hill ending in the water source. Today was pretty intense. There was a good section where to your left is a steep hill and to your right is a rock face. I enjoyed that section a lot. Slowing our pace made climbing a lot less taxing and we didn't have to stop as often. The last half of the day was interesting because the trees changed to pine and some sort of tree that is green right now. It was like a completely different trail. We made it to Gooch mountain shelter and so did a bunch of people that stayed at Hawk mountain.Tomorrow seems like it will be a race to a small camp ground before blood mountain. You are required to have a bear canister for all of the shelters in the blood mountain area so and if you don't stay at this campground, you have to hike through 14 miles. We could do it but with rain forecasted and the soreness of our legs, we would prefer the camp ground. As far as I know there are only 6 tent sites so it will be a race. I think we are getting up early to get there.","Hawk Mountain campground
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 16, Fri",8
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584394,"We woke up at 5 to try to beat the rush and ended up being the first out of camp. We woke up to light rain and packed our tent up wet. This was our first morning hiking in the dark with head lamps and it was a very cool experience. As the sun rose, we had a nice fog that made for an amazing atmosphere to hike in. It was a pretty tough 8 miles but we both felt stronger and we got to the camp ground at 11 a.m. I guess you could say we won the race but as I had predicted the camp started filling up pretty quickly. The camp ground was really cool and the water source was nice. Tomorrow we hike blood mountain and that's a little daunting for sure.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584448,"The climb up blood mountain was pretty intense. Lots of stone stairs and we were climbing the whole time. The summit was amazing. It's the second highest point on the trail and the highest point in Georgia. The climb down was kind of intense with a ton of large step downs and rock. 
We resupplied in town and then had lunch. We did laundry and then stayed at the hostel at Neels gap. That was interesting because it was a lot of people in the small room.","Lance creek 
",Neels gap,"Mar 18, Sun",8
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584449,We started on the trail at 5:30 am. I didn't sleep too well in the hostel. Dad said it was the best sleep he has gotten. The morning was super foggy and it rained a little bit on and off. We decided to hike 11 miles to the deep gap shelter. The last 3 miles we hiked in the rain. We never put our rain jackets on and we were pretty warm the whole time.Today offered some of the worst switch backs we have encountered so far and it was probably more climbing than blood mountain. We got to the shelter and dried off and several other people showed up. At this point we are fitting 7 people in the shelter and at least 2 under. I'm a little uncomfortable but I figure it will be fine and I should get the shelter experience. It's supposed to be bad weather tonight so that will be fun. In true grapevine fashion bad weather turned to tornados.,"Neels gap
",Low gap shelter ,"Mar 19, Mon",11
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584721,Today was rough. We did 15 miles through what is considered the toughest part of Georgia. There was so much elevation gain and most of it was in the last 4 miles. Tray Mountain is only 200 feet shy of Blood mountain and I will admit that when we got to the top it was beautiful. We had a 2 hour head start on Blue but he caught up to us in the last mile and smoked us. We set up our tents and we are expecting rain and then snow. We will see how sleeping goes.,"Low gap shelter 
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Mar 20, Tue",15
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584722,"We woke up to howling wind and snow. We knew we had to get down from the Top of Tray but we left later than usual because we didn't know if it was going to be slick. Coming down wasn't too bad and for a while the snow was fine. About 3 miles in, the snow and wind kicked up and for the rest of the hike we were getting whipped in the face. My clothing held up and it feels good to know that I have a solid system. I forgot that the tough section was actually Unicoi gap to Dicks Creek Gap. There were times where it felt like we were climbing for twenty minutes on some of the steepest grades that we have encountered. I can confidently say that the last two days have been the most physically challenging things I've ever done. We plan to go into Hiawasee to stay and then take a zero tomorrow. Our knees and heels are hurting and we hope the day off will help.","Tray Mountain Shelter
",Dicks Creek Gap,"Mar 21, Wed",10
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584844,"After two nights and one zero in Hiawasee, we stepped back on the trail. Our zero was fun and we got a lot of good relation and healing done. Today was hard. It funny to hear that the previous section is the most difficult. So far after blood mountain, it's been a brutal amount of climbing. 
It was cold all day and there was still snow as we climbed. The snow made it a little sketchy in places and the cold was bone chilling. After what seemed like hours of climbing we made it to the shelter and turned in pretty early. Tomorrow we are trying to make it to Carter Gap.","Dicks Creek Gap
",Muskrat Creek Shelter,"Mar 23, Fri",11.80
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584846,"Another cold one. This section of trail had a lot of climbing but the switch backs were nice and easy. It rained most of the day and it was very cold. The air was foggy and you couldn't see any other mountains. 
The trail had big rocks that are pretty intense to navigate through. It was muddy and some parts were slushy snow and so you would have very slick shoes when you went to navigate the rocks. We slid quite a bit and it added a little bit of danger to our hike. 
The forecast for the next week looks like a lot more of the same cold and rain. I hope the winter storm passes soon.
We Made it to the shelter and I helped get a fire started and we spent some time socializing with people. It really cool that we have been keeping up with Godfather. He was on Springer the same night as us and he is from Kansas. 
We put up our bear bags and got in our tents. Right now it's a light rain and I hope it stays light.","Muskrat Creek Shelter
",Carter Gap Shelter,"Mar 24, Sat",12.50
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585330,It rained quit a bit last night. I got a little wet from the rain hitting the dirt around my tent and splashing. Dad had standing water in his tent.We hiked about 4 miles to Mooney Gap and mom picked us up. We went to Franklin and had a beer at the Lazy Hiker Brewery. We found a sushi restaurant and had lunch. We then got back on the trail.The next 4 miles was pretty intense. We were feelikng a little full and out of it from lunch and the first thing we encountered was the most intense climb we have faced yet. Part of it was just rock face that you had to very carefully navigate up and it rendered feeling poles useless. After three rock faces like that it turns into little stairs made with logs that are very steep. It all paid off with an amazing view and a fire tower to climb. The last bit was downhill.When we got to the shelter it was pretty full and all of the tent pass were taken except for one. I would hardly call it a tent pad thoughh because it is pretty angled and I see myself sliding all night. The pads are just leveled off areas on a steep hill and dad is sleeping at a worse angle than me. He accidentally got his bear line stuck in a tree and his tent still has a bit of water.,"Carter Gap Shelter
",Long Branch Shelter,"Mar 25, Sun",8.60
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585331,Last night was cold. Dad had ice on his sleeping pad where the water in his tent had pooled. I fought the slope all night and Dad said his mat curled over his bag from the slope. We were pretty miserable. We met Mom at Rock Gap and when we got in the van I suggested a few days off because Dads heel was hurting and the inside of my ankle was not feeling so good.We drove into town and got a hotel room for two days.,"Long Branch Shelter
",Rock Gap,"Mar 26, Mon",3.70
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585333,We decided to do a short section to see how we are feeling. It went okay and we think we are going to get back on trail tomorrow. After the hike we went back to town and toured the gem and tartan museums.,"Rock Gap
",Winding Stair Gap,"Mar 29, Thu",3.60
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585336,"We woke up and had breakfast and decided to try hiking today. MOM dropped us off at Winding Stair gap and drove to Wayah gap. We wanted to do less miles today and the next shelter is both over 10 miles and a major climb after Wayah gap.
The hike wasn't too bad. We are both feeling better but non vascular injuries take longer to heal and we have a bit left. We are hoping that doing some shorter days will help. 
Tonight we are sleeping in the van at the Wayah Bald trail head. Tomorrow we are going to do the climb back up to Wayah bald.","Winding Stair Gap
",Wayah Gap,"Mar 30, Fri",5.90
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585683,Today was pretty easy. Mom drove us back down to Wayah gap to start. It was mostly up hill but it didn't kill us. The view from the fire tower was nice and it was cool to read about the benton mackaye trail. The last mile was down hill to the shelter. A ton of people were at the shelter but most people were tenting.,"Wayah Gap
",Wayah Shelter,"Mar 31, Sat",5.10
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585685,We woke up and packed up and then headed to Burningtown gap to mean Mom. When we got there we were surprised by a whole Easter lunch that she had cooked up. Ham potatoes and green beans. Such a treat. There were some people offering trail magic sandwiches to people and someone had left easter eggs with candy for hikers to find. I ended up picking up around seven Easter eggs that people had opened and just dropped. It's amazing how unwilling people seem to pack out trash. The weird thing is that one of the most common left items we have seen is underwear. The rest of the hike wad pretty nice and we met mom at Tellico gap to stay in the van so that the next day would also be a nice length.,"Wayah Shelter
",Tellico Gap,"Apr 01, Sun",8.40
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585687,"We were woken up by flashing police lights around 10 p.m. A man had been missing for around a week and we ended up parking next to his car. The police officer asked if the vehicle had moved while we were there and if we had seen any missing posters. There was someone camping in a tent near us but he never got out.In the morning we got packed up and as we were leaving, we asked the man who was camping if he ever woke up or talked to the police officer. He said no but that he wanted to because He had found a hammock and backpack with everything pulled out of it and a line of paracord down a steep hill when he was trying to find some where to sleep. He said that if he would have gone down the hill he would have probably found the missing man's body. I hope he gets that information to the right people and I hope he is wrong.The hike down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center was a pretty cool. We were on a very narrow ridge line for a good portion of the hike. The rest was down hill and parts of trail were washed out and took some creativity to navigate. My knees are killing me after the miles of down hill. We ate ate the restaurant at the NOC and then went into town to stay in a hotel.","Tellico Gap
",Nantahala Outdoor Center,"Apr 02, Mon",7.90
Oatmeal Shoes,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585688,Today was intense.We started back on the trail at the NOC knowing that most of today would be uphill.It wasn't too bad in sections but the amount was what was difficult. We made it to Sassafrass Gap shelter and sat down to eat. We had planned on staying there for the night but another hiker told us there was a camp spot 3 miles away. We decided we could do it and pushed on.That was a hard 3 miles. The first two are all uphill and goes through a section called the jump up. It's true to its name. It was a very steep grade. It felt good to finally get to the top. I think we gained over 4000 feet of elevation today.Locust Grove is full tonight. I think there are around 9 tents in a very limited space. It's supposed to rain all night and then hopefully let up in the morning.We are only 16 miles away from the Smokeys and we can't wait to see Fontana dam.,"Nantahala Outdoor Center

Dad started wearing his aluminum hard hat and he got a comment about blinding people with it. We made it to the road and Mom took us back to the hotel. We had dinner and walked around. Tomorrow we are going to slack pack all the way to the start of the Smokies and stay one more night.

We walked past a group of people that had stayed there and talked to them for a minute.We kept walking and found out that the visitor center was closed. The walk across the Dam was pretty cool. It's one of the larger Dams I've been to. The rest of the walk was up to the trail head.We went back to the room and relaxed and then had dinner. We hopefully start the Smokies tomorrow.

We took off around 11.The trail crosses a bridge and then goes back into the forest. You cross railroad tracks and slowly wind your way up with a nice view of the Nollichucky river for the first 2 miles. Then you get to the first of the very steep section. We leap frogged with a couple of people as we took turns stopping to recover. We made it to the first shelter and took a break and talked to a couple of people, some of which we met at Standing Bear.After our break we started again. The trail goes back and forth over and along streams until you get to the top of the first section of climbing.Most of today was climbing and after the first 8 miles we still had around 3 miles of climbing left. This section was brutal. The trail was exposed to the sun and full of medium sized rocks that beat up your feet. We made it to the top of Beauty Spot and had some amazing views. Mom ended up meeting us there. We still had 1.4 miles to Beauty Spot Gap where she was going to meet us.The 1.4 miles was difficult. My ankle was hurting and my feet were mush. We made it and had some food. Then we went back to Jonesborough to go to the Depot Street Brewery. It was meh beer.We ended up staying the night in Johnson City.","Uncle Johnnie's Hostel
