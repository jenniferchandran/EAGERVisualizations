Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363665,"In this journal, I will do my best to capture the details of my experiences backpacking sections of the Appalachian Trail. I may have three entries in one day, and three days with no entries. I really don't care to calculate daily mileage, but would rather capture my thoughts and the flavors and textures of the journey. If you choose to follow along, WELCOME! Just know that I will likely ramble. Someday the synapsis that is supposed to happen in my ol' noggin just might misfire. Treasured memories might fade. If that happens, perhaps this journal will help me reminisce.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363666,"After a couple of delays and reschedules, I pulled out of the driveway at 9:30 this morning, loaded for bear. Not literally, although that subject did come up recently... Anyway, I was agitated because the roofers, scheduled to finish on Tuesday, were still working on Thursday. Our yard was littered with nails and scraps, and I really wanted to inspect the finished product. But mostly, I was just nervous. I was hitting the trail.    I drove three hours around the Smokies to the east and exited Interstate 40 in pursuit of the trailhead near Davenport Gap. The plan is to hike from Davenport Gap to Hot Springs, NC. This is not a big feat in hiker world. Thirty six miles is a small step, but it's a step in the right direction. And since I don't know what I'm doing (a tiny fact that keeps resurfacing) these miles loom large.    I parked the car at Walters Power Plant on the Pigeon River and took stock, once again, of my gear. I said a little prayer, took a deep breath, and strapped on a very full backpack. Yikes, it felt heavy.    I knew this feeling in the pit of my stomach...where, where. Ah, yes. Cedar Point. This is the ""strapped into the roller coaster and I'm trying to smile"" feeling. I want to do this. No, I don't. Yes, I do.
Where's the nearest restroom? 36 miles.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363667,"The afternoon was lovely, warm and bright sun; the best of fall. I backtracked down the road, following the Pigeon River, and felt better to be underway. After a mile or so, I began to search out the trail in earnest. Nowhere. It must cross the river, but where? Errant for at least 30 minutes, I came upon a beat-up pickup with two empty dog crates in the back. Oh, man...hunters. I'm lost in the woods with local hunters. Sure enough, after a few minutes, here came this father/son team down the path. With a tightness in my chest, I approached these strangers and asked if either of them could possibly direct me to the AT trailhead. They were polite, kind, and gave me flawless directions. I thanked them profusely, and as I walked away, they inquired, ""By the way maam, have y'all seen two lost dogs?""    ""Over the river and through the woods"" I went, climbing all the way to Standing Bear Farm. I'm here early, but that's fine. There are two southbounders here also; young guys waiting for mail delivery. They are expecting a box of supplies to get them through the Smokies. Coming from Maine, they are delighted to be nearing the end of their thru-hike - ONLY 250 miles left!    Curtis, the owner/operator here, loves his land and gave me a tour. Besides the main house, there are several other outbuildings housing a complete kitchen for hikers, a bunkhouse, store, laundry, cabin, and of course, a privy (I think I'll take my chances in the woods with that detail).       I'm pitching my tent in the yard tonight. Thank you, Curtis, for your hospitality and for the lucky buckeye.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363668,"Dawn couldn't come fast enough and at first light, I was packing up my dewy tent. I left the farm with purpose in my step, wondering about EVERYTHING. How much stamina do I have? How fast is this pace? Is it easy to miss the white blazes? When will I get cell phone coverage?    The trail headed up, up, up and as I climbed, 18 wheelers on the interstate were climbing as well. I could hear their engines straining and gears shifting to navigate the extreme elevation changes at the TN/NC border. Around the bend I went and immediately was met with complete and pure silence. I mean total quiet. Not a leaf rustling, not an acorn falling...nothing. I stopped just to listen; so rare these days. A Bible verse, memorized long ago, popped into my mind. ""Be still, and know that I am God."" I was still and I did know Him. From that point on, there was peace in my heart and I was on a mission to enjoy this journey.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363669,"I stopped for a snack at the top of Snowbird Mountain which has a grassy peak, void of all trees. This ""bald"" offers lovely views and the date being October 7 meant that the sumac was on fire with color. There was a nice breeze, warm welcoming sunshine, and not a soul around. At the summit there is this FAA facility that I explored - a wierd looking tower - futuristic, if this were 1950.    I took off again and before I knew it, came upon a sign announcing Groundhog Creek Gap. Groundhog...sounds familiar. I pulled out my trail guide and, yes, this is where I had planned to spend the night! But it's only 2:45! The next shelter is over 8 miles, so I decided to go on down, take a look around, and fill up on some water. As I turned, about 10 yards in front of me scampered a small black bear. Across the trail and up the hill went this beautiful, shiny, black coat, with a rump swinging back and forth as it hurried to exit the premises. It never looked back. I was so surprised, I never even thought to attempt a photo. I just stood there, fascinated.    Groundhog Creek Shelter is really old. It has a fieldstone frame and metal roof. Deep in the gap, it's dark and a bit creepy. I fixed a warm meal and pitched my tent about 50 yards away. I had not seen a single person all day, but when I walked back to the shelter, there was Tracker. Before I even introduced myself, I exclaimed, ""I'm so glad you're here!"" He broke into a big toothless grin. Tracker was sitting at the picnic table trying to repair his partial denture with Super Glue. He had broken it while having a great stay in Hot Springs.    About an hour later, 3 hunky hikers came singing into camp. These guys have been section hiking the AT together off and on since Springer Mountain. I'm really glad for the company here and hope to sleep soundly.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363670,"Boy, was it dark last night! And cold - 40 degrees. I packed up quickly and sipped a cup of coffee/tea mix that Tracker shared with me. We chatted about the ""pterodactyl"" that startled us in the night and decided that Tracker was sitting in Tennessee and I was in North Carolina. I wished him well and was the first out.    Today was perfect and I got into a rhythm of scanning for footing, blazes, and critters. I started to hum and the crunch of leaves and ticking of poles made me feel joyful. This is it. This is what hikers embrace, get addicted to, and try to, but cannot, explain. It's a fellowship with the natural world that cleanses the soul...a joy unspeakable.    At Max Patch Road, I came upon my first stile, which is a small ladder over a fence or jog around an obstacle. I stopped to take this picture, and a car full of guys drove by, shouting cat calls and whistling. My sunglasses and baseball cap are a good disguise as I'm old enough to be their mother. My legs still look good.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363671,"Max Patch at noon in October is a gift. This is a grassy bald with 360 degree panoramic views of the North Carolina and Tennessee mountains. It was stunning. But before I could find a place to sit and take it in, an older gentleman approached me. He reminded me of my Dad, with suspenders and a ready smile. He wanted to know all about the AT, how it works, and where it goes. And, of course he asked, ""Alone? You're doing this alone?""    I found a place to sit and knew immediately that I would not forget this moment. Mesmerized by the motion of the tall grasses, I had a front row seat to a show that only God could have produced. Layer upon layer of mountains in every color of autumn caused tears to swell. My fellow Americans, this is one beautiful land. Shoes off, stomach full, heart open...it was unbelievable.    After an hour and a half, I tore myself away, having 7 miles to go to Walnut Mountain Shelter. Fortunately, it was mostly downhill and the trail followed and crisscrossed a beautiful stream, allowing me to refill and refresh. Being Saturday, I met many day hikers and some southbound thru-hikers. And guess what? The 3 hunky hikers are tenting here at Walnut, too.   By the way, thank you Jay and Jodi for the headlamp. It's really, really dark at night in the woods!","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363672,"The breeze turned into a howling gale last night. I was surprised that a limb or dead tree didn't topple because it roared all night long. I wore every piece of clothing except my rain jacket to bed, and finally had to cinch my mummy bag up and over my head to stay warm. Down sleeping bags are breathable!    I got up at 7:30 and it was ccccold, so I just packed up my tent and got moving. My food weight was dwindling and I was wearing all my clothes, so the backpack was light. It felt easy and good. I warmed up climbing Bluff Mountain, and gradually the layers came off until I was back to a T-shirt and shorts.    Tradition dictates that hikers on the AT adopt a trailname. It's a great idea really because it allows for a degree of anonymity while helping to keep track of each other. Some choose their own trailname; others have it given by fellow hikers. My husband, ""Rimshot,"" for his love of all things percussion and bicycles, bestowed the name ""Rooty"" on me.    I shuffle my feet. There, I said it. Not so bad on the beach, but problematic in the woods. I have tripped on roots too many times to count. Once, before poles, I did a full out face plant, skinning my knees, forearms and chin. I swear, I heard that old oak laugh.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363673,"My trailname was confirmed today on a long downhill. Feeling confident, I picked up the pace with the idea of skipping the planned overnight at Deer Park Mountain Shelter and pushing on to Hot Springs. This would be close to 16 miles. I have never hiked 16 miles, even without a backpack. Sometimes you just want to see what you've got. Well, at 4:00pm I made it. I stumbled, tripped and hummed my way to town.    Along the way, I met Fire Marshal, Steady and Deal, all southbounders from Katadin. I also met a young man and his dog hiking to Davenport Gap (where I started), plus several squirrels, an owl, a dead snake, a junco, a woodpecker, and some poison ivy.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/363677,"I woke up at Elmers Sunnybank Inn on the corner of Walnut and Bridge, Hot Springs, NC - another new place. As I walked up last evening to inquire about lodging, Natty and Papa Bear (AKA The Godfather) greeted me on the front porch. Others started arriving, and I found that they were having a thru-hiker reunion! I called Dave, unpacked, took a very welcome hot shower and headed across the street to the Diner for a burger and salad. There sat the 3 hunky hikers wanting to know how I got there so fast. Ha.    Today I got to be a tourist. This little town is a piece of Americana from Norman Rockwell...delightful. I took some photos, went to Bluff Mountain Outfitter, and counted trout in the stream. I found an old Victorola with a box of mystery records at Harvest Moon Gifts. I read a book on the porch of the Inn and played the antique piano in the music room. Back at the Diner, a local gentleman told me how much the AT means to Hot Springs. The trail goes right down the main street with AT emblems embedded in the sidewalk. I did my very best to boost the local economy.","Davenport Gap

Dibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592452,"Yes, the trail calls and I must go.  I started backpacking in the fall of 2011, continued in 2012, and have picked it up again in 2018.  I apologize that my hikes in 2012 have not been entered on the Trailjournals site.  I still have all of my notes and pictures, and some of the stories are pretty eventful.  Perhaps, when I can get to it, I will add the 200+ miles that I logged that year.  But for now, I will at least add this part of my journey which begins tomorrow.  Since the fall of 2017, I have been reading the Trailjournal entries of the ""class of 2018,"" updating pieces of my gear, and getting back into some kind of physically acceptable shape.Our neighborhood has a good view of the Smoky Mountains.  Almost every day in the month of April, the high elevations have been white early in the morning.  It has been a very cold start for hikers this year, and I must confess that winter backpacking is not for me.  I don't have the gear or the initiative to do it.  So I have been biding my time, watching and waiting for a break in the weather.  It's finally looking good.My interest in the AT began when my husband, Rimshot, and I stopped by at Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap in Georgia.  We had passed by this building many times while driving over Blood Mountain, catching glimpses of the boots dangling from the trees.  When we finally stopped there, and I was fascinated by the place, the gear, the books, and especially the AT itself.  After answering a ton of questions (the knowledgeable staff must get so weary of this), one of the kind young men looked me in the eyes and said, ""You could do this.""
