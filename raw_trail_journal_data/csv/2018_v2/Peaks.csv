Just assume from now on that all views on all mountains are great and ill mention the ones that stood out to me. Around 11 I got to the Lonesome Lake Hut for coffee, soup and left over cold oatmeal that i doused with syrup. The huts are like hotels in the mountains and have self serve goodies for people hiking by. By 5 i was walking along Franconia ridge which was by far the best 2 miles of trail ive ever been on. While up there i met Tony and Savannah for Maine, they were kind enough to give me a tall boy Magic Hat ipa that made me even more happy.","Eliza Brook shelter

The caretaker gave me tons of leftover breakfast and even leftovers from dinner the night before. While there i met Traildog and Notrace. I then climbed South Twin mtn and hiked with a grouse that wouldnt get off the trail for a few hundred yards. I stopped in Zealand Hut for a bit to relax and hung out with the crew for a while. I also met Noli there, she started her thru hike in Rutland going north which is about dumbest thing ive ever heard since the trail is so rough in this area. She was understandably not a happy person. At the end of the day i hitched a ride to the general store on 302 for resupply with a woman named Cecile and got a ride back with Randy. I got picked up by the first car that passed both times!","Garfield pond

Peaks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594125,I didnt get up until 8 because i was feeling pretty sore. Met Jellybean and Dosed first thing. I started the day with a climb up Webster Cliffs and hiked across what is known as the presidential range for the entire day. The views were only matched by Franconia ridge. While hanging out at Mizpah hut the caretaker gave me a heaping bowl of leftover pasta and beef so that was nice. Before i left i asked her where mount Trump was and she didnt even look up. I had myself laughing for a good hour after that one. The wind from Mount Washington to the Madison hut was ridiculous. It put me on my butt twice. When i got to the hut there was still a spot available for work for stay so i decided to take it. I scrubbed the stove for about 20 minutes and got an all can eat dinner and a warm place to sleep that was out of the wind.,"Campsite

His name is Dosed, he started at Springer on March 29 which makes him the second fastest person ive met. The crew at Madison Hut said Taz was angry when he got there because he was only averaging 27 miles a day through the Whites. After the guests ate breakfast i swept the floor for 5 minutes and then ate as much sausage and pancakes i could handle. It was nice looking back at the whole presidential range from Wildcat mtn. Carter notch hut only took one work for stay and Dosed beat me to it. The forecast called for rain all afternoon and night but it was clear all day.","Madison Hut

The hostel was full at 11am when i got there so i offered him $20 for the couch and he agreed. So i got laundry, my own room and all you can eat waffles for $20 which makes one of the best deals i got on the trail. I resupplied at walmart and then ate at the local chinese buffet. They brought my check while i was still eating so i waited an hour so i could eat 2 more plates. It turns out Dosed actually goes by Ghost and he just thought it was funny i was calling him something different. I saw Donkey Kong for the first since NJ, he heard about the blowdowns in NY and took an Uber around them. Hes says hes going back to finish that section after Katahdin.

Ive started running into quite a few south bounders (sobos) recently. We went to Sarges pub for a few hours to watch the World Cup, drink beer and eat pizza during the storm. I was also finally able to get through to my dad. Once back at the hostel i played poker with the caretaker Anthia and 2 sobos Dirty Dan and MG. Greener, Ghost and Walkytalky were also around.
