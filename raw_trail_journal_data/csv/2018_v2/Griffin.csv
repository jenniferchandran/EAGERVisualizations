Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580118,"The Appalachian Trail thru hike has been a distant dream of mine since first viewing the white blaze, etched into a tree on a section of the trail in the Smokies, while hiking with my wife, some 15 years ago.
We both retired in early 2013, spent two and a half years cruising The Great Loop, and the last year and a half RV-ing from Connecticut to Washington and the Canadian Rockies.
Family and friends kept asking us ""what's next?"".  Why, the Appalachian Trail just seemed to be within the natural progression of our retirement adventures.  Although my wife will not be hiking with me, she, willingly, will be my hike ground support crew, without whom I'm certain, I would have difficulty navigating all the backstage dynamics to have a successful endeavor.
We're currently home in the panhandle of Florida through the Holidays, with the children and grandchildren.  Backpacking gear is being collected and training has commensed.  Very little elevation changes here, as expected, compared to our day hikes in the Rockies, Glacier NP, Canadian Rockies and northern Cascades.
I've chosen an April first start date, not too early, and hopefully, not too late.  Our plan is for me to hike to Harper's Ferry, NOBO, then drive RV north to Maine and hike south from the northern Trail terminus, Mt. Katahdin.  Several family and friends have voiced desires to join me for a day/s on the Trail.  I hope everyone is flexible, as I envision timeline logistics and planning, more than a week or two in advance, will be unrealistic.
I have never had much discipline to contribute to a personal journal of any kind, short of a ship's log, so this first entry is just a start of a beginning a new adventure, backpack hiking the AT.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580154,"My wife, Annie, and I day-hiked at least three days a week this past summer while touring the Western US and Canada in our RV.  This experience was awesome for both of us, but also served as a pre-training conditioning for hiking the AT, but obviously without the overnight challenges.
We've been home about two weeks and I have begun training in ernest by hiking and biking local trails.  So far my longest hike was 10 miles (virtually zero elevation changes) and yesterday's bike ride covered nearly 32 miles.  I have included the bicycle regimen so as to give my feet time to toughen up, but more importantly to add some variety to my near daily workouts.  I've already developed identical blisters on both feet under the ball.  I'm attributing these to walking on hot asphalt surfaces and not stopping to change socks and letting my feet cool down.  
My gear list keeps growing and I'm beginning to think, ""do I really need all this stuff"".  I will probably start the AT with way too much and be adding to the donation boxes during the first couple of weeks.  I do plan on hiking/camping in a large nearby state park, so hopefully I will have weaned my gear inventory down to the absolute necessities.  Right now the Boy Scout in me is telling me to, ""Be Prepared"".

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580194,"I really can't complain, training for the AT hike here on the northern Gulf Coast has no drawbacks.  Weather is mild, winds are variable, rain this time of year, sans tropical systems, are welcome.  
I can't say I enjoy it, though.   I'm still trying to wrap my head around the hike, food, shelter, physical capabilities and mental steadfastness, these are all are boring into my psyche.   I feel that once those components start to solidify, the ability to enjoy and be ""in the moment"" will calm my apprehensions,  and then I  can focus on the beauty that surrounds me.  
Today's bike ride, (my blisters did not allow a hike, again) was more enjoyable than previous rides.  I now have a mirror on my helmet and I carried only water instead of my day pack, stuffed with everything but the kitchen sink.  I have never road 39 miles in one day before, and this evening I can see why.  Totally different muscles, but again, I feel doing something is better than nothing. 
This is my third entry in my AT hike journal.  One, it makes my entries official, second, it's amazing how I've come to enjoy this effort, sharing something as personal and, hopefully, helpful to the next hiker.  
Is this OK?

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580335,"It is a great feeling to get out on local trails and hike knowing that soon, the Real Hike is in the near future.  
I rode past a gopher turtle today (picture attached) and that really got me thinking about my training and how I need to go about it.  I've been hiking and biking too fast, then tiring way too soon.  I have to slow down, enjoy where I'm at and condition my body to endure 6, 8 or 10 hours on the trail.  It is still very early in the training, but I have the time, so I need to slow down.  
Today's hike was in and around Big Lagoon State Park, just west of Pensacola.  Trails weave through long leaf pines and scrub oak, mostly sand, but at times on boardwalks over the acres of salt marsh.  A really beautiful park, we've camped here a few times, but mostly used the boat ramp to launch our boats through the years while we lived and worked in the area.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580435,"Late October and early November is our favorite time of year, especially after a cold front.  The daytime temps in 60's with lows in the forties.  Great weather for training for The Hike.  Hiking twelve miles yesterday, carrying about eighteen pounds in my day pack, was glorious.  The chronic blistering issues on the balls of my feet never happened.  Modifying the insole inserts and donut moleskin padding combination, hopefully, will be the solution.  I have EEE width feet and very high insteps, with a tendency to land on the balls of my feet, which I'm sure has led to the blisters also.  Concentrating on 'heel-toe' gate yesterday also helped.  Hope I'm not boring anybody talking about my feet?Training gives me the opportunity to try out new hiking gear I've been receiving in the mail, almost daily it seems.  Carbon fiber trekking poles with cork grips, by Big Foot, are my latest acquisition.  A quarter of the weight of my previous pair and a better locking system are the upsides, the grip is smaller in diameter, so I think I need to add tape, possibly bicycle grip tape, to expand the grips.Annie, my wife, has already begun locating and booking campgrounds near the trail to park our RV.  Swannanoa, NC, Damascus, Va, Waynesboro, VA and Eddington, Me (I'm flip- flop hiking) are locations selected so far.  Monthly rates are much more affordable and not moving the coach as often (I do all the driving) will be the plan.  I'm an optimist, and what's the downside if something happens and I need to get off the trail, we have a leisurely camping adventure along the Appalachian Mountains, from Georgia to Maine and back.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581338,"I have mentioned in previous posts that training here on the Gulf coast presents few elevation challenges compared to what will be encountered on the AT. So when I do encounter an elevation change I'm on it.The wildlife observatory located on one of my training hikes presents an opportunity to get some ascending and descending practice. These past few weeks I have only been able to train one or two days a week, hiking eight to ten miles a day. My pack is loaded with pretty much everything that I will carry on the AT, except food. I've added full water bottles to simulate the food weight, which I approximate at near eight pounds, with my plan of resupplying every five to seven days. My training after the first of the year will include several overnight hikes in the northern part of Santa Rosa County within the Blackwater State Park boundaries. This is a very large forested park with HILLS. Hopefully by then I will have culled my pack weight to less than 35 pounds. I know this still sounds like a lot to some but it is what it is. I wish everyone a Joyous Holiday Season and may your New Year be healthy and happy.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582471,"According to Wikipedia;
A shakedown hike is when a backpacker, in preparation for a long hike such as the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail or the Continental Divide Trail, takes their selection of equipment on a shorter backpacking trip with the intention of testing its trail worthiness. A related term, the pack shakedown, is when a novice hiker has a more experienced hiker suggest changes to the novice's equipment, often simply suggesting things to leave out.

My intent for the three day shakedown backpacking trip to Florida's Torreya State Park was the former description of my hike.  It turned out to be also the latter description, because of a chance meeting with ""Predator"".

Mr. P., as I'll call him, allegedly earned this trail name because of his alien sounding snore.  He's a self described ""ultralight (UL) gear fanatic"".  He does not post here on TJ, has 700 miles of the AT under his belt and numerous international backpacking experiences.  Our campfire discussions ran from cuben fiber products to UL headlamps and everything in between.  Needless to say, but I will, there are a few changes to my gear list in the coming weeks, either lightening the load or eliminating items, I thought, I couldn't live without.  I'm going to miss the 30oz. coffee press, among other things, too.

The ""Andake"" one man UL tent (for a small man and pictured above) is going to be the first casualty.  It proved to be very confining, poorly vented, (imagine a condensation party dampening anything touching the walls, = everything) and not designed for extended thru hiking, IMHO.  Reccommended by Mr. P., the Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL2, appears to satisfy my desire for a self supporting, high volume and somewhat light weight tent.  Although pricey, when broken down to number of nights I plan on using it, the cost is worth while.

So, anyone hiking SOBO on the AT this coming week between mm 448.6 and 394.8, you may meet ""Predator"".  He is a very friendly person and an all around good guy.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586404,"Milage is for last four days.  Taking advantage of the great weather, after taking a day off at Top of Georgia  hostel. It rained all night at Muskrat Creek, fortunately it stopped long enough Monday morning to pack up and hit the trail.  The trees were coated with white ice in the higher elevations, very beautiful.
The past few days saw a few milestones.  First, crossed into North Carolina from Georgia, one state down, only thirteen to go.  Second, summited my first mile high mountain on the AT, Standing Indian Mountain tops out somewhere at 5500 feet.  Lastly, crossed the 100 mile marker yesterday, have I really hiked this far? 
Annie met me today at Winding Stair Gap, near Franklin, NC.  After hugs and kisses for her, and Moose, my Chihuahua, got down to business of resuppling food, clean clothes, picking through a tote of what I call expendables,  TP, fuel, Ibuprofen, Claritan, etc....We then ate brunch and drank real coffee, then back on the trail.  
Hope to get to the NOC by Friday evening.  Apparently, there is an outdoor exposition there this weekend.  I don't think I need anything, everything now in my pack is useful and used often, no fluff.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586786,"Milage is for past two days, with a stop at Cold Springs Shelter tent site.I hiked to the NOC on Friday afternoon, about 12 miles.  I suffered a lack of planning that day by not carrying sufficient water.  From Cold Springs there is no water for the first 10 miles.  Upon the descent, the weather warmed up and I was running drastically low on water.  Typically, I start every morning with 2 liters of water, but that day I only had one.  Water had been plentiful and I figured I would save the added weight of the extra liter.  I paid for that.  By the time I reached the water source, about 1.5 miles before Rufus Morgan shelter, I had run out.  Even though I drank heartily there, I still was moderately dehydrated by the time I reached the NOC general store.  Two quarts of Gatorade later, about an hour, I felt much better, had a cold shower, donned my cleanest clothes and went back to the store for a well deserved cold beer. The NOC is an incredible facility, bunkhouses for the hikers and rafters, kitchen, laundry, outfitter and restaurants.   Annie and her sister, who flew up to keep Annie company while I am hiking, came on Saturday to pick me up and bring me back to our RV in Asheville, NC.  Moose was so happy to see me, so was Annie, BTW, that he wouldn't get out of my lap, hoping to weigh me down so I couldn't leave again.  The weather today, Sunday is nasty as will be most of tomorrow.   Planning on going back to NOC on Monday so as to get an early start on Tuesday morning.  Needless to say, I will definitely pay more attention to my trailguides and Guthook app, such that I don't have a plan for water.  A saying Annie and I often relate to our kids and grandkids, ""Every lesson in life costs something, regardless, may not necessarily be money, but something"".

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587703,"Mileage is for the last six days.  
The great weather couldn't last forever.  Annie picked me up yesterday afternoon from Clingmans Dome, mm 199.3 of the trail.  With severe weather predicted for today, Monday, and tonight.  I was able to reach her and asked her to come get me.  
Back to the great weather for those six days.  The skies were mostly clear providing for some great vista viewings.  Temperatures during the day were between 50 to 60 degrees, with nightly lows around 35 to 40.  Perfect hiking conditions.  The warmer temperatures also brought out the wild flowers.  Along miles of the trail, these past couple of days, are lined with thick carpets of small white, purple, pink and yellow flowers, just amazing.  Look in my photo gallery for a couple of pictures.
I had the good fortune to finally meet up with Buster, the Chihuahua, and his trail companion, Old Smokey, while staying at the Fontana Hilton (shelter).  Both Buster and Old Smokey are NOBO and SOBO thru hike legends.  Buster is now 18 years old, I'm told, has one good eye and a undersized lower jaw, but none of these issues have slowed him down the least.  He greeted each hiker as they walked in, but never strayed too far from his buddy, Old Smokey.  
Annie met me at the Fontana Village for resupply, then she made a quick trip back to Robbinsville and brought me a fried chicken dinner from Ingles, a regional grocery.  She really does love me, and I'm grateful she does.
The hike into The Smokies , on the first day, had me worried.  Numerous veterans warned of the uphill challenges, but as it turned out for me, went very well.  I can't say that about the second day, from Mollies Ridge to Derrick Knob shelter, 12.1 miles, was worse.  Although there is not a lot of elevation difference from one to the other, it seemed like it was all uphill, and steep.  I had thoughts at the beginning of that day to continue on to the next shelter a few miles further, but when I took the pack off at Derrick Knob, I knew it wasn't going back on.  
I have finally started to stay in the shelters over these past four nights.  I thought the night noises emanating from fellow hikers would be too much to handle, but for the most part, it wasn't intolerable.  The mice never bothered me, never even saw one, or any of the other creatures that call the shelter home.  Biggest advantage is time saving in the morning, not having to strike and bag my tent.  Biggest disadvantage is I like to rise early and get to walking, but I will wait patiently until someone else starts to stir, waking up the others, then I try to silently exit the shelter.  
Hopefully, I can get back on the trail tomorrow, and get to Davenport Gap, the northern exit of the Park by Friday.  Then it's back to Asheville to move Annie and the RV to Damascus, Virginia, for the next month of my hike.

Damascus Trail Days Festival begins today.  Hikers have been streaming in since yesterday morning.  The official tent city didn’t open until Thursday morning so many early arrival hikers were either able to find hostels or stayed on the trail stealth camping until the city provided tent area officially opened.
 
Last Saturday another hiker, Drizzy, from Syracuse, NY, and I hitched a ride to Carver’s Gap from the Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel and slack packed southbound over Roan Mountain back to the hostel, some 12 miles.  We chose that option because Carver’s Gap cut about 2000 feet of the elevation change up Roan Mountain from the north.  We passed other thru hikers loaded up and hiking up the five mile incline to the top and we understood their pain.  
 
On Sunday we again shuttled to Carver’s Gap from Greasy Creek, but this time slack packed north the 15 miles to US 19E and checked into the Mountain Harbor Hostel.  Our shuttle driver delivered our full packs that morning to the hostel.  The bunk house was full, so we raised our tents near the creek, but still enjoyed all of the amenities the hostel had to offer, laundry, showers, wi-fi, and free coffee in the morning. 
 
 I decided not to wait for their famous breakfast buffet on Monday morning, Drizzy did, so I hiked out at 7am.  My intentions were to hike the 18.8 miles to the Moreland Gap shelter and camp site.  That is now my longest one day distance to date.  I’m feeling stronger, good thing, because the Guthook App warned of sketchy water source at the shelter, so I loaded up with 4 liters of water before making the last 2 mile climb to the shelter area.  True enough, the water spring was described by other hikers who hadn’t heeded the warning as very poor.  
 
On Tuesday morning I hiked only 7 miles to the Black Bear Resort and Hostel to pick up a resupply box from Annie.  I was going to continue on but the weather forecasts for rain had turned to the worse, so I got a bunk and waited until Wednesday morning to decide if I was going to continue from here or call Annie to pick me up.  We all woke to pouring rain and no let-up for the rest of the day, Annie to the rescue.  
 
I’m hiking because it is enjoyable and if it’s not enjoyable, I’m not hiking.  It was our philosophy while cruising in our boat or driving our RV.  I have all summer and fall to complete this adventure with no time table restrictions, other than reservations at campgrounds along the way.
 
Annie and I rode our bikes along the Virginia Creeper Trail thru town yesterday, and then biked around the downtown area.  We ran into numerous 2018 class of hikers I had met along the way.   We’re both looking forward to the festivities, food and music Trail Days is going to offer.   Hopefully, the rain will not be too much of a problem for the planners, vendors and hikers, so everyone can enjoy the festival.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592241,"Mileage is for previous eight days.I apologize for not posting for over a week but I was trying to cover trail miles to catch up with my planned itinerary.  Came close, eight miles short of Mt. Rogers Recreation Area.  That is where we planned for me to get off the trail to move the RV to Waynesboro, VA.  Annie really helped getting the miles in by shuttling me to trailheads so I could do some slack packing and cover some ground.  The longest such hike was 21.5 miles north into Damascus last Sunday ( I skipped the last day of the Trail Days Festival, two days of festivities was my limit ).Right now we're sitting in Waynesboro watching the weather forecasts (tropical system Alberto) and trying to decide where to get back on the trail.  I think I may hike north through the Shenandoah National Park this week, if the system stays west of here, then head back south to where I left the trail two days ago.  Hiking through the Grayson Highlands was supposed to have been a highlight of the trail but my timing was wrong due to heavy rains that day.  The wild horses were around but not many and the vistas were fogged in.  I lucked out and was able to sleep in the Thomas Knob shelter to avoid packing a wet tent the next morning.  The bear problems near that shelter probably kept many hikers away.  The rangers have placed a bear box inside of an electrified fence a good distance from the shelter to discourage bear encounters.  Apparently, this particular bear learned how to steal hanging food bags by climbing the spindly fir trees and breaking the limbs.  Numerous bags had been swipped until the box and fencing placed.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592770,"Mileage is for past four days.Having Annie and the RV nearby offers many options on attacking this endeavour.  After relocating here to Waynesboro, Virginia on Monday, my plan was for her to drive me south to Mt. Rogers where I left the trail.  The rain in southern Virginia was as bad as here near the Shenandoah National Park, so instead of driving three hours to hike in the rain, why not drive 30 minutes to Rockfish Gap, southern entrance of the SNP on Skyline Drive, and hike in the rain.  Lots of rain.  Fortunately, I arrived early at each of the first three huts to score a dry bunk.  Spaces in the huts filled quickly through the afternoon, those who had to pitch tents suffered torrential rains through the nights, many not sleeping at all, just trying to keep their belongings dry inside.The trail through the Park was couriously redesigned after Skyline Drive was built over the original trail.  It takes the hiker to the crests of a ridge, falls down to cross Skyline Drive to rise to the crest of the opposite mountain, then repeats, from one side of Skyline to the other.  However, there are long stretches of near flat hiking, with well maintained trail surfaces, except in heavy rain.  The trails turn into rapids in heavy rain, probably no way to divert that much water however designed.  One's shoes become waterlogged and your feet very pruney looking.  It is interesting hiking with folks who are 300 miles ahead, technically.  They are a closeknit bubble and seem more suspect of new comers, even section hikers.  I stayed in the background and did more observing than participating.  I knew up front that due to my hike itinerary, leaving the trail for more zeros, moving the RV, shuttling about to slack pack, etc., it was going to be difficult to maintain a schedule with one group of through hikers for very long.  I am grateful for the few relationships I have developed, and I am maintaining communication with them.  Hopefully, seeing them on my flip-flop south this coming summer.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593978,"Mileage is for the last eight days.Completing the trail through the Shenandoah National Park was, for me, anti-climactic.   The persistant rain each day with very wet and muddy conditions was exhausting.  Don't get me wrong, I love SNP, in fact, of all the National Parks Annie and I have visited over the past two years of travelling full time in our RV, SNP is in my top three favorite places.  The weather just dampened, pun intended, my spirits.  Tomorrow I hike into Harper's Ferry and meet up with Annie at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters.   I won't be hiking any further north.  I still have 300 miles of trail south of SNP to fill in.  I won't be able to get them all in before we head north to Bangor, Maine.  I am leaving my AT completion destination, McAfee Knob, for when I hike back south.  It is the most photographed spot on the AT and will be a perfect trail ending location.

Chinook, ATW and I taking advantage, these past three days, of the various slack packing shuttle options offered by Stanimals Hostel in Glasgow, Virginia.   We typically head to the trailhead by 5:30 am, then we're finishing by one pm, before the day gets too hot and humid.  
But, it's back to the real world and full packs tomorrow as we continue north and hopefully be near Waynesboro by next Monday, some 55 miles.  
This past Monday evening the St. John's Episcopal Church here in Glasgow,  hosted all hikers to free pizza, salads and desserts.  Trail magic just is amazing and much appreciated by all of us hungry hikers.   
Hiking this section of Virginia mostly parallels the Blue Ridge Parkway and reminds me very much of the hike through Shenandoah National Park,  minus the wayside cafes and lodges.  There have been numerous spectacular overlooks of the surrounding valleys as one hikes along the upper ridgelines.   The weather for this past week has been dry resulting in water sources getting more scarce, and without water the hiker suffers potential dehydration.   I've been adamant about adding electrolyte supplements to prevent cramping.  A typical day I'm consuming nearly a liter an hour and still feel thirsty by the end of the hike.Please visit my photo album for more pictures of my journey along the AT.

I've discussed long term planning for the AT, weekly and monthly goals, with numerous hikers, and typically most folks have a daily average in mind with an ultimate end date.  The daily goals shift upwards as time passes such that they reach Katahdin by a certain date.  
When Annie and I started to plan, months before my launch date, she wanted a hike agenda divided down by the month, so she could make campground reservations, knowing we were going to be in the height of summer vacationers.  Remarkably, after our first three months, I am only 44 miles short of my predicted mileage!   I have hiked some 820 miles over 68 days, taking 17 zeroes over the past three months, 15 of those in April and May.  Obviously, right now I'm not hiking, and won't be until July 6th when I climb Mt. Katahdin, turn around and start my SOBO journey.  
Another hiker, Chinook, whom I had previously hiked with in Georgia, teamed up on those last four days, taking advantage of slack packing 40 of the 55 miles.  Stanimals hostel shuttled us two days, then Annie met us at Reeds Gap for one night off the trail, Chinook in a motel, and me in my own bed, after nine days on the trail.  She then took us back to Reeds Gap to slack it the 19 miles to Rockfish Gap, the southern entrance to Shenandoah National Park.
I suffered a shoe blowout hiking into Glasgow, Virginia, fortunately, Stanimal's shuttle driver had time to drive me 20 miles to an outfitter in Lexington, Va.  
Nothing worse than taking unproven shoes on the trail.  This is now my fourth pair.  The Hitechs' (my favorites) lasted over 500 miles, including training, the Oboes lasted only 40 miles, my feet rejected them almost immediately.  The Altras' were great, but lasted less than 200 miles before the side fabric split in the middle of the day (they are shipping a new pair to Maine, free of charge, $10 shipping).  The Keen's are similar to the Hitechs, and hopefully they will go some distance.
Annie and I are just amazed this summer is going so fast.  Her sister Norma, who flew back to Louisiana today, said the same thing, where has the time gone.  
We are looking forward to seeing our Coastguardsman granddaughter in New London, Connecticut while on our way north.  Also, stopping in Boothbay Harbor to visit with my brother Don and his wife Janie for a couple days.  Hope they have lobster in Maine, because we both like lobster.

Griffin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597024,"Mileage is for the previous four days, the 7th through the 10th.
 
Annie and I arrived in Bangor, Maine on the third of July.  Our plan was for her to drive me to Millinocket and I would stay at the Appalachian Trail Lodge for one night, the fifth, then, take the shuttle to Baxter State Park the next morning.  Well, Friday morning thunderstorms were predicted across the area and one does not want to be on exposed mountain top with lightning flashing about.  So, I spent the day visiting with hikers just about to start their SOBO thru hikes and those who had just completed their NOBO thru hike.   I was the only flip/flop hiker amongst the group and gladly answered questions about the southern portions of the trail, while I was asking questions about the northern parts of the AT from the hikers who had just completed the hike.   
The climb up Katahdin the following day was spectacular but very challenging, especially the climb down.  I say climb, because lots of the trail going up it was, literally, climbing on boulders through the rock slide portions of the trail.   It was great seeing other hikers, who had shuttled to Baxter with me, up at the summit.  We swapped phone cameras around so everyone got their picture taken with the famous sign on the summit.  Some folks really hammed it up climbing on the sign framework to get the picture, whereas I was happy with a relaxed pose.  Actually, I was too tired to climb any more. 
The descent was, at times, terrifying for me.  I guess I hadn’t turned around while climbing up, so when I faced over the edge of where I had to go to come down I’m sure I gasped.  Fortunately, no worse for wear, I safely managed the descent.  I can’t say that for my Mechanix gloves.  The fingertips were worn through to the skin on all ten fingers.  The granite was comparable to # 20 grit sandpaper.  
I was able to share a tent site with another hiker at Katahdin Stream CG, which meant I didn’t have to hike the extra two miles to the Birches lean-to.   Unless a NOBO hiker has a reservation at the Park for two nights, they are limited to only one nights’ stay at the Birches, typically on the day they get to the Park, which adds that two mile walk.  The next day, after summiting they are told to leave, most having to hitch-hike into Millinocket, or try to get a tent site at the privately owned Abol Bridge Campground, just outside the Park boundary.   I feel this is an undue burden on NOBO AT hikers because it is very hard to predict ones arrival several months in advance to make a reservation.  
The first night in the 100 Mile Wilderness I camped at Hurd Brook lean-to.  The day was very hot and I was still very sore from the previous day’s climb up Katahdin.  Leaving Hurd Brook I met a LASH (Long A$$ Section Hiker).  Bret, a retired diesel mechanic from North Carolina, had hiked the 100 MW three previous times so I was anxious to gather as much info as possible about the area.  We talked and hiked to a tent-site that was not identified in any of the trail guides that he knew about, on the banks of Pollywog Stream.  Again, I’m still aching from the Katahdin, he suggested one should take a day off after that climb.  NOW you tell me.  Well, right now, there won’t be another.  It was that tough, for me.  
Bret was gone by time I rolled out of my tent the next morning (5:00am).  He did say he was going to hike 23 miles that day, not me, my goal was to get to Mahar Landing to be picked by boat and be shuttled to The White House Landing Lodge, on the shores of Pemaduncook lake.   The lodge is a little pricey, but well worth the expense.  Homemade hamburgers and pizza (huge) for dinner and a big breakfast was available to all hikers for a modest cost.  The resupply items were limited and very pricey, though. 
Unfortunately, I had to leave the trail from there and was shuttled to Medway the next morning, where Annie picked me up.  The pain (not blisters any more) in the balls of my feet has gotten worse even with the custom shoe inserts a foot doctor made for me in Charlottesville, Virginia.  I’m not sure, right now, whether I will return to the trail in the near future or not.   If anyone has followed my posts from the beginning, I talked about blisters developing in the affected areas every since I started training for the hike.  I feel it is all related to my current circumstance.  I will finish the Appalachian Trail, one day.
