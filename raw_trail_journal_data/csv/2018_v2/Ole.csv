Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582626,"This is it - I'm all in.  I will be hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2018.  I'm reaching the point of no return as I plan to buy my airline ticket within the next couple of weeks.  I've also bought some of the major gear I will be using and have told family and friends that I'm going to attempt the AT this year.  I have a lot more to do but I am very excited for this opportunity. I am writing this journal mostly to keep friends and family updated on my progress.  I realize that other AT thru hikers will be reading this journal also to track my progress. For this reason I will be including some additional information in the pre-hike posts that my friends and family already know to provide background for those who don't know me as well.     Recently, I have been waffling between excitement and thinking what am I doing?  I start to get caught up in the details and then get completely overwhelmed by the enormity of what I need to do before I leave.  I’m a list person but in recent years much of my outdoor travel has become so familiar that I can prepare for a week long canoe trip without compiling any lists.  I keep having this nagging feeling that I’m overlooking something really important.   I’ve read a number of books, blogs and journals that cover a wide spectrum of preparedness prior to the hike.  Some have thought (and over thought) every detail of their hike.  Others seem to just wing it.  It seems that age may be somewhat of a factor in preparation with older hikers planning out more details.  Some of the hikers who planned their hike with a high level detail eventually transitioned to just going with the flow.  I plan to fall somewhere in the middle with some planning and some winging it.In the next few posts, I'll provide more detail on my training, gear and food strategy.  Taking care of a lot of details over the next couple of months should keep me busy.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Thu",0
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583285,"Its about two months until I start.  I bought my airline ticket and am now totally committed to the hike.  I've also been buying gear and have spent more than I want but if I'm getting lighter, its money well spent.  And of course training has also been on going.
It has been a tough winter for outdoor training.  We’ve had a lot of cold and windy weather with a little less snow than average, until recently.  A cold snap hit on Christmas Eve and lasted for two weeks followed by a couple of warmer days and then more cold.  I have been trail running and had about 6-7 runs in a row with temps below zero and a couple of them at 20 below.  While I’m running in that weather, I try to visualize what it will be like hiking in the heat of summer.  For the past two months, I've averaged about 3-4 times a week trail running and twice a week strength training.  I'm now beginning the pack hiking phase of my training.  I will be carrying a 25-30lb pack and hiking the local streets and trails, targeting hilly areas.  Hopefully I can ramp up the pack hiking before I start.
Along with the physical training, I've also been focusing on the psychological and emotional side of the hike.  From everything I've read, it can be an emotional roller coaster and a primary reason people drop out is because they didn't handle the mental aspect of a six month hike well.  There will be times when the hike is not fun.  I will get cold, wet, sore, hungry, lonely and homesick.  I need to prepare myself mentally as well as physically.  One exercise I read about suggested that you list the reasons that you are taking on this hike.  Below is my list.
I am thru hiking the Appalachian Trail because:
I want to experience a landscape at human speed. I like the logistical challenge. I want to improve my mental toughness. I like the physical challenge. I want to see the entire trail. I want to do something significant. I want to make friends along the trail. It’s the next big challenge. I will have lots of time to contemplate my next career move – both professional and volunteer opportunities.
When times get tough and I think about quitting, I'll look at the list and remind myself why I'm taking on this hike.
In my next post, I will describe the gear I will be taking.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Sat",0
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584775,"Its about a month until I begin my hike.  Lots of things are starting to come together and I’m starting to feel more focused.  That doesn’t mean there aren’t times of being overwhelmed by the details.  The lists continue to be written and I’ve been checking stuff off on a daily basis.
Training continues and I’ve started to do more pack hiking.  I bought a new pack for the trip and have filled it with 30lbs of gear and have been hiking through Hartley Park near my house.  My hike yesterday covered eight miles.  I want to get up to about 12 miles before I go.  I’ve also been continuing with strength and core training twice a week and still doing some running.  I’m feeling pretty good about being ready to hike in a month.
I’ve also been doing some travelling, spending a weekend at my daughter Heather’s place in the Twin Cities and last weekend going on a winter camping trip in the BWCA with friends.  While in the Cities, we went to REI and I bought a new pack and a few smaller things.  In the next two weeks I will be going camping again and another trip to the Cities where Heather and I will be attending the NCAA Frozen Four and a Twins game.  Lots going on prior to my departure date.
I have purchased much new gear for this trip.  My new tent is a Big Agnes Copper Spur which from what I read is one of the most popular tents on the AT.  My new pack is an Osprey Exos 58, again another popular choice among AT thru hikers.  I bought a Thermorest Neolite pad and I put a long pillow case around it so I can sleep directly on the pad on warm nights.  My sleeping bag is a 10 year old Montbell down 30 degree bag that weighs about 1lb 4oz.  I’ll be using a Sawyer Squeeze water filter, a mini Snow Peak stove and titanium pot.  My base weight (all gear besides food and water) is around 20 lbs now as I debate a few small items.  Things like a first aid kit, vitamins, and personal hygiene items are still in flux.   This is much lighter than my gear for my Superior Hiking Trail thru hike last fall.

I made reservations today to stay at the HoJo in Daleville VA on the night before I start.  Details are coming together and I’m sure the next month will fly by.  I’m starting to bounce off the walls with excitement.  Some of my next tasks will be to organize mail drops for my first few stops.  I don’t plan to do a lot of mail drops but in a few places where resupply options are few, I will send myself supplies.  I will follow up with a post about my food and nutrition plan for the hike.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Fri",0
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586399,"Preparations continue as I decide on a final gear outfit and start putting together a few mail drops for the beginning of the hike.  I had a nice diversion from hike planning over the past couple of weeks by heading to the Gunflint Trail in northern Minnesota for some ice fishing and also going to the Twin Cities to watch my alma mater, the U of Mn Duluth, play for the NCAA hockey championship.  After a great season last year and a second place finish, the Bulldogs did one better this year and won it all.  The championship game against Notre Dame was a classic with the Bulldogs prevailing in front of a raucous crowd at the Excel Center in St Paul in a tight checking defensive game.  It was fun to share the experience with my daughter and to spend some time at her place.  We also attended a Twins game that had a temperature of 27 degrees at first pitch – the coldest home game in Twins history.     
I’ve been planning my food strategy and have done some research to make sure I get the fuel and nutrition I need.  One term that jumped out at me was skeletal wasting.  This can happen when you burn through your body’s store of fat and you begin to burn muscle.  I don’t think any of us who are attempting a thru hike want this happen.  
My research on thru hiking nutrition led me to an article (https://thesummitregister.com/nutrition-for-thru-hikers-part-1-food-for-fuel/) that references research by Dr. Brenda Braaten who has a Ph D in nutritional biochemistry.  The gist of her research says that thru hikers need to eat plenty of calories but also make sure your diet has a balance of carbs, proteins and fats and it doesn’t matter as much to the thru hiker if it’s a healthy diet since you are burning those calories so fast.  She talks about the Snickers Bar diet since they have a good balance of carbs, protein and fat.  You wouldn’t last long with a Snickers only diet since variety is important.  She also talked about the need for Calcium, Vitamin C and a probiotic in your diet to help you absorb necessary nutrients.  Thru hikers are known for eating huge amounts of food and insatiable hunger.  Eating so much can cause the body to flush foods through too fast to absorb needed vitamins and nutrients. 
Part of my strategy is to find a good variety of foods available along the trail and have a good balance of carbs, proteins and fats.  I will also be attempting to eat healthier when I’m in restaurants in trail towns.  And I will be taking supplements of calcium, vitamin C and a probiotic.  Hopefully these steps will help me get the nutrition I need to maintain energy and prevent the dreaded skeletal wasting.
I carried too much food on my SHT thru hike last fall and will try to carry less at the beginning of this hike.  From what I’ve read, almost all new hikers on the AT carry too much food.  Its hard to think about walking all day when you are concerned you won’t have enough fuel.  Its a delicate balance of minimizing weight and having enough fuel and nutrition.  With more resupply opportunities on the AT compared to the SHT, minimizing weight should be easier.
Its two weeks until I start hiking and my training has come to a premature end.  I went to a podiatrist last week because I had a broken little toenail and he suggested removing the entire toenail.  Its been a week and its still very sore but I have two weeks to heal before I start hiking.  Unfortunately, I won’t be able to do anymore pack hiking or running before I leave.  I will continue to go to the gym for strength and core training to compensate.  I still feel good about my fitness level and am ready to go. I’ve been reading other journals on this site and am excited to get started and hopefully meet some of the people I’ve been reading about.",,View Entry,"Apr 11, Wed",0
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587917,My travels went well after an odd start.  The TSA in Duluth pulled my pack off to the side and tested my Pro Bars and Cliff Bars for explosives.  I flew to Chicago with a friend I hadn't seen for a while.  It was good to catch up and tell him about my hike.  I caught a shuttle from the Roanoke airport to Daleville and he also brought me to the outfitter for fuel and the grocery store for more food.  He them drove me to the HoJo.  I met a few other thru hikers while checking in.  I picked up my mail drops and organized my pack.  I'm now having a cold beer and trying to relax. It's hard to not get overly excited since I've been preparing for about four months and it's hard to believe that the start is so close.  The plan is to start slowly and be patient.  Thanks to all my friends and family for your support and encouragement.,,View Entry,"Apr 24, Tue",0
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588003,After breakfast at the HoJo I hit the trail at 8:30am. The first 3 miles were easy and then a 2 mile climb to the first shelter where I had lunch and a cup of tea to fight off the damp chill. It was down a steep hill and then I had to take my shoes off to cross a creek. Made it to Wilson Creek shelter by 4pm. There are two groups here from GA and SC five people total. Early night as the others are in bed at 7pm. I feel good after today's hike and will take it easy tomorrow.,"Daleville

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588089,Some observations after my second day of hiking.  There is a noticeable difference between how green the valleys are compared to the ridgetops.  The valleys are lush and green and the Ridgewood are just seeing some buds on the trees.  Virginia is not flat in this area.  The trail builders did a good job of routing the trail through this rugged terrain.  Switchbacks help take the edge off the uphills.I'm at a shelter that doesn't have a water source so I had to carry 3 liters of water for 3.4 miles including up a long hill.  I'm camped with three other thru hikers all around my age.  Good conversation around the fire.  Since rain is forecast I'm going to sleep in the shelter tonight.  Hopefully the snoring is at a minimum.Tomorrow looks to be wet so I will hike a shorter distance.  I'm still slow packing up in the morning and need to improve my routine.  I'm sure in time I will get faster.,"Wilson Creek Shelter
",Cove Point Shelter,"Apr 26, Thu",13.80
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588284,"This post is a day late due to lack of cell signal.
Given the shelter spacing I decided on a shorter day after almost 14 miles yesterday. After seeing the Bryant Ridge shelter I knew I made the right decision. It is a beautiful two story structure with lots of deck space for cooking and it's located between two creeks. We had a full shelter with about 12 sleeping inside and a few more in tents. It was a lively crowd of mostly people in their 20a and a few 50s. We were up late - about 9pm. Good company as I met many new people.","

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588286,"Woke up to a chilly clear day as the first of the large group starting packing up. Had breakfast and chatted with others about their plans for the day. Lots of people looking at another 20 plus mile day. Not me, I'm trying to be patient and not injure myself early. It was up a steep hill to start and I gained over 3000 ft over the day. We passed over Apple Orchard Mt which has a FAA tower on it. I crossed another trail that had a 50km race going. They were at the 45km mark and most people were walking given the warm sunny day. After much climbing and a warm day by MN standards 10 miles felt like enough. Looking to make my first town stop in Glasgow on Monday.","
",Thunder Hill Shelter,"Apr 28, Sat",10.20
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588512,Very cold and windy in the morning. I had ice in my water bottle. Good thing I brought my water filter in the tent. It was really cold hiking in the morning with temps in the 30s and the wind blowing over 20 mph. There was some rough trail at the start of the James River Face Wildnerness. It was mostly downhill at the end of the day to Matts Creek shelter which is a really nice shelter site. I love sleeping by moving water as it makes it easier to fall asleep.,"
",Matts Creek shelter,"Apr 29, Sun",12.40
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588514,"Another beautiful morning and not as cold at lower elevation. I packed up in preparation for my first nero, which is a term for a near zero mileage day. It took me about an hour to hitch a ride to Glasgow but the nice gentleman have me his card and told me to contact him when I flip back down this way later this fall. I picked up my maildrop bought some resupplies and was disappointed when the nearby pizza joint was closed on Mondays. I plan to stay at the town shelter tonight and hit the trail again in the morning.","
",Glasgow,"Apr 30, Mon",2.20
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588696,I started in Glasgow this morning leaving the shelter at 8am. It took me an hour to hitch a ride back to the AT. The trail follwed a stream for a while before starting to climb slightly. I got water at the last creek crossing as the trail climbed steeply for about two miles. It started to get very warm as I worked hard to carry my heavy pack with about ten pounds of food. After that the trail went up again for a total of about 2700 ft. We found out that the temp got up to the mid 80s. I was a sweaty mess as I got to camp about 5pm. It was by far my hardest day. We have about six of us in camp. One section hiker and the rest thru hikers. I continue to be passed by waves of thru hikers who started between Feb 20 and about March 10. Most are young hikers covering around 20 miles per day. Its fun to camp with new people each night and hear their stories.,"
",Punchbowl shelter,"May 01, Tue",10.50
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588964,"It was another really warm day, again in the mid 80s. I'm not acclimated to the heat and decided to do a shorter day. I hiked pretty slowly and got to camp by 3pm. I hung out by Brown Mt Creek with some hikers I met previously and was able to wash up some.
It was a reflective day as it would have been my Dad's 85th birthday. He passed away a little over a year ago after battling Parkinson's. He showed a lot of courage and character and had a never quit attitude. He and my Mom inspired my love of the outdoors and travel. I was fortunate to have the opportunities they provided.
I ended the day camped next to the creek as I always sleep better with the noise of moving water.","
",Brown Mt Creek shelter,"May 02, Wed",9.60
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588967,It was hot again and I hiked my longest day yet. It started with a 2700ft climb over the first four miles. After some shorter steep ups and downs the trail went through some blazing hot meadows with no shade and little breeze. The shelters are spaced pretty widely in this area and water can be scarce and far off trail. I looked at a campsite a few miles before here but chose the hike on. One more hot day forecast and then some rain on Saturday. I need to get to Waynesboro by Monday as my food is running low. Only one other guy in camp so far. I've seen people hiking in the dark and have talked to a few who like night hiking.,"Brown Mt Creek shelter
",Seely-Woodworth shelter,"May 03, Thu",15.80
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589440,It was another hot day with temps in the mid 80s in the higher elevations and over 90 in the valleys. I stopped at the Priest shelter which is named after the mountain it is located on. There are some very funny confessions written in the log book that made for good reading during a snack break. Going down Priest Mt was very rocky and hot and took it's toll on my feet. I got my first blister. After another shorter steep climb I camped at Harpers Creek shelter which has a decent pool in the creek for a bath. I felt clean but still stunk. I've been turning around on the trail while hiking to see where the bad smell is coming from and no one is around. It can't be me. Rain was predicted that evening but only a few drops fell. I camped with some fast young nobo (northbound) hikers.,"

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589443,"There were supposed to thunderstorms and showers most of the day but they never came. The morning started with a 2200ft climb and I hurried a little so I wouldn't get caught in a thunderstorm. I didn't have to worry as it remained dry. Since my feet were sore from the day before I decided to stop at the next shelter. There were lots of people out for the weekend or day hikes. I had my first yogiing ecperience. To yogi is a hiker term for getting people to give you food without asking for it. I was talking to a large group of day hikers answering questions about my hike when they asked about my food supply. I said I thought I had enough but it would be close. They then started giving me candy bars, granola bars and other snacks. Very kind and friendly people. One of them said he would be coming through Duluth this summer on the way to the BWCA. He said he needed a place to leave a vehicle in Duluth for two weeks and I told him he could leave it at my house.","

The trail was quite rocky with only moderate hills.I wanted to get to the last shelter before Waynesboro. I saw lots of people on the trail mostly thru hikers getting ready for a town day. The shelter was a really nice two story shelter with space for ten and it was located by a nice creek. We had a full house and another 8 people in tents. A crew of hikers I met before came in just before dark and it was good catching up. They had been off trail for a few days. I picked up a cold a few days ago and have been very congested and having sneezing fits at night. Some rest on town will do me well.,"

I hiked the five miles to Rockfish Gap where we found trail magic, a cooler with cold drinks and assorted snacks. As we walked toward the highway crossing a trail angel was dropping off a group of hikers and offered us a ride to town. Ann filled is on on the location of rrestaurants and stores. She dropped ua at Stanimals hostel where I had a much needed shower and started laundry.

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/589607,"I slept well on a real bed. I paid an extra $5 per night for a room with two queen sized beds and nobody rented the other bed so I had a private room with my own bathroom. I closed the door so l wouldn't hear snoring from the other rooms down the hall. Five of us from the hostel borrowed a car from the hostel owner and drove to the outfitter store where I bought a new stove, lighter weight shirt and a new food bag. My old stove was turning itself up so I decided to replace it. My old food bag had lost some of it's ability to repel water. I picked up my drop box at the post office and mailed home the items I replaced. After taking inventory of the mailed food I went grocery shopping and bought too much food. I packed and repacked my food bag and then took some out and put it in the hostel hiker box. Hiker boxes are where hikers leave surplus and unwanted items. Some frugal hikers can do much of their resuppling from the hiker box. Some lucky hiker will find the large amount of food I left behind.

The rest in town was good for me and it was fun to experience the hostel life and hang out with hikers I've met along the trail. I planned a shorter day today based on the shelter and water source spacing. I hiked slowly on a nice sunny day with temps in the 70s. I'm at a shelter site that is pretty full with about ten tents and four people in the shelter. The people range in age from early 20s to late 70s. Tomorrow there is no water source after the first mile until the next shelter 13 miles away. I will be carrying lots of water and a heavy food bag fresh from resupply.

A thunderstorm hit shortly before I got to camp. I got to camp early and took a spot in the shelter because more trail was forecast. More and more people kept coming and tents were being set up on some pretty poor spots. I counted over 20 tents and I think there were almost 40 people in camp.

I stopped at the Loft Mt camp store and are lots of junk food and a banana. The ice cream hit the spot on a warm day. I stopped to soak my feet in a creek.

I tried to set a pace to do a 20 but it got really hot and humid after 10am. The first big hill did me in. Late in the day when it was apparent I wouldn't make the shelter I stopped at a spring near an old cabin. I cooked dinner on the picnic table and then found a place to camp about a quarter mile away. There is another camp store about two miles up the trail and I will stop there for something to eat. There are also wayside restaurants in Shenandoah NP and I plan to stop at them for a meal and their famous blackberry milk shakes.

The trail remains flooded in low areas and springs are flooding the trail in some higher areas. I hiked a section today called the rollercoaster. There were constant hills all day, some quite steep. The trail was also very rocky and combined with the flooding and wet conditions, it made for a slow cautious hike. I started at 8am and didn't get to camp until almost 6pm. I crossed a few milestones today. First l crossed the AT's 1000 mile mark which means those who started at the south end are almost half way home. I also crossed into WV.

I have a food drop package at the AT Conservancy and a package with small items at the post office. I'm staying at the Teahorse hostel and there are only a couple of other hikers here. Unfortunately all the restaurants in town are closed on Monday. I will stop at the ATC tomorrow morning and find out If I can cross the Potomac River bridge. It sounds like there are shuttle options if the bridge is still closed. Regardless I will be in Maryland tomorrow.,"

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591490,The bridge over the Potomac River was still closed. Many hikers jumped over the gate but I didn't think I could make it with a pack on. If I would have had someone to hand my pack to I would have attempted it. I ended up getting a shuttle and missed four miles of trail. After getting on the trail a thunder storm caught me and another hiker just short of a shelter and we got soaked. I ended up going a shorter distance since it took so long to escape WV. I'm now in MD and not looking back.,"

After lunch at a park the trail became smoother and wider as it entered a surburban area. Lots of day hikers that smelled good, unlike me. I put in a good day and am camped in a beautiful spot. The nearby spring is flowing at a high volume which will make for good background noise for tonight's sleep. Looks like more good weather for the next couple of days.","

To finish in six months I need to average about 365 miles a month or about 85 miles a week or just over 12 miles a day. I wanted to be under those numbers my first month or two. Physically I feel good. My feet are doing reasonably well and I'm quickly gaining my trail legs. Mentally I'm still having fun and enjoying the company of other hikers. I still camp with mostly new hikers every night as the people that started on the south end are mostly doing twenty plus mile days. The last two states went quickly but PA has over 250 miles of the AT. I'm hoping the next month goes as well as the first.,"

When the trail is relatively smooth I can also take a long lunch and still get to camp by 5pm. I'm camped at a shelter area that has a tenting area quite far away so I'm not interacting with the people staying ing the shelters -there are two here.

I hiked a slow three miles after breaking camp and headed to a restaurant for brunch. I ate a double cheeseburger fries and a milkshake. After that I waddled to the hostel and took a shower and did laundry. I tried to hitchhike to Walmart for a resupply and ended up having to pay the hostel five bucks for a ride. This is the second time I've not gotten a ride hitching. I rented a hike from the hostel for a dollar and rode a half mile to the same restaurant and had dinner.

It had a store with a grill so I had a second breakfast of a western egg wrap and chocolate milk. I bought some more food supplies and went to the AT museum. It was really interesting and the old heavy camping gear must have been really heavy. I walked through the state park which was really pretty but crowded. Later in the day I stopped by a country store and had a cheeseburger and fries. Hiker hunger has set in and I'm eating an obscene amount of food. I know I'm burning a lot of calories but I amaze myself at how much I can eat. Hopefully I can go back to a normal diet when I'm done.,"

I started with some uphills and then came to an area called the rock garden. The trail designers were particularly cruel in routing the trail up and over some huge rocks. Making matters worse everything was wet and slippery. It took me almost three hours to go four miles. The trail got easier going through farms and hayfields. I stopped in Boiling Springs for lunch at the Boiling Springs Tavern which is an upscale establishment. They suggested I sit in the bar instead of the dining room. My meal of a salmon blt was fantastic and the bartender and other patrons were friendly and had lots of questions about my hike. After lunch the hiking was really flat and easy going through farm country. When the trail went across fields it was very hot in the sun. A strange thing happened last night just before dark. I was camped by a small creek with three other campers and it was calm and humid. A dead tree about 10 inches in diameter and about 30 ft tall fell about 20 ft from where I was standing. Not sure why it fell then instead of during a windy day.,"

I hope this isn't the start to a bad bug season. Its too hot to out on long sleeves and pants. The end of the day was hilly and rocky which I haven't seem for a few miles. Rain is forecast for tonight and tomorrow. I will be walking through Duncannon PA in the morning and plan to stop at the famous Doyle bar and hotel.

Unfortunately it was closed when I walked through. I got a second breakfast at a nearby restaurant and then resupplied at an expensive convience store. The forecasted rain held off all afternoon as I headed for a large shelter. This one sleeps 16 and was close to full. It started raining around 6pm and the forecast is for more rain tomorrow.

",Peters Mt shelter,"May 31, Thu",15
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592764,When rain is forecasted most hikers like to stay in the shelters and not have to pack up and carry a wet tent. Shelter space can be limited. Shelter spacing along the trail and the capacity of the shelter is also a factor. Last night I was at a shelter that could hold 16 and it was full. All but two hikers were headed north like me. The next shelter was 18 miles away which is a long distance between shelters. Usually they are about ten miles apart. I decided to get up early since rain was forecasted and hoped to get one of the six shelter spots. I was the first to leave at about 6:20am. I was soon passed by a number of faster hikers. I hiked 18 miles over some rocky wet terrain and was able to get a spot in the shelter. We ended up with seven in the shelter. That was my longest mileage to date. I'm not sure I will push that hard again for a shelter spot. Next time I will take my time and set up my tent if I have to.,"

I then took a wrong turn and hiked an extra half mile. Next up was a really long hill to climb. Progress was slow in the morning. The afternoon went better as I ran into a few people I know. Toward the end of the day I came across a guy and hia daughter offering trail magic. I had a couple of sodas, chips, a banana, apple and a candy bar. Shorty after that at the last road crossing a girlfriend of a hiker I had met had before had brought more trail magic. This time I had a couple of cold beers. A perfect way to end another long hike. The shelter was a tenth of a mile away. This one is a cabin that sleeps 12. So far there are 7 people here. The trail magic and cabin shelter made for a great end to the day.","

When I told him MN he said he was going there today and he was going to Duluth. He was surprised to hear that I was from Duluth. He said his dad is a physician at St Likes and he was on his way to pick up his grandma to go visit his dad. Our conversation was short as we arrived at the trail. What a crazy coincidence. It was a steep climb to start and the first part of the day the trail was rocky. The last five miles were much easier. I'm staying at a shelter that is a shed in the backyard of the caretakers house.

I will try to be more aware in the next few days. Most of the sightings are in the really rocky areas. Today was a long day with a number of difficult rocky areas. One spot had large flat rocks on an angle and the trail took you over a jumbled ridge about 40ft high. It was a little unnerving with a pack on.

I didn't want to climb a large hill and cross an area with no trees in the heat. I will hit it first thing in the morning when it's cooler and supposed to be overcast.

The highlight of the day was a new bar and grille at the last road crossing. I had fish tacos and a brownie a la mode.

The rest of the day was really hot and humid. I was sweating on the flats and downhill and pouring buckets on the uphills. On a number of hills you would get to bare ridge tips which felt like stepping into a sauna. I was totally soaked when I got to the last stream and chose to camp nearby instead of carrying water almost a mile to the next shelter. Thunderstorms and heavy rain hit around 7:30pm.

I'm staying in a two story shelter sleeping up top in hopes the bugs will leave me alone. Its raining again and it's supposed to rain all night and all day tomorrow.

Needless to say the trail was wet and slippery. I took it pretty slow including a huge descent off the ridge I had been on. The low area was very swampy and buggy. I stopped at an antique store that sold Coke and Snickers bars. The sun came out briefly and it got hot. Shortly after thunderstorms came through and soaked me. I made it to camp by the time the rain quit. The forecast calls for sunny and hot for the next few days.,"

The trail was wet and flooded in areas but dried where the sun and wind could get at it. It was still slippery so I walked a little slower. Not many hikers were out this morning. I encountered a southbound hiker who was hiking barefoot. He was in his 60s and carrying an older style pack. He didn't see me until he was right next to me because he was concentrating on the trail. We said hello but he didn't seem to want to stop and talk. I suppose he is tired of answering questions about bare foot hiking. Like they say here on the AT, hyoh.......hike your own hike. At one of the road crossings there was a trail stand. It had a mini fridge with cold drinks and assorted candy bars, trail bars and hard boiled eggs. It was all on the honor system and there was a picnic table and outlet to charge your phone. The weather forecast is calling for about a week of temps in the 90s with high humidity.

As I was climbing a long hill near a road crossing I saw a cooler and a new garbage can. The cooler was full of quarts of Gatorade and the garbage can had chips, crackers and pop tarts. I drank a Gatorade and ate a large bag of chips. More kind souls leaving trail magic. I met another hiker in camp who is also journaling on trailjournals.com. Its nice to put a face to his journal.

When I did get in the woods the bugs were bad. After a sweaty climb the bug situation improved. A long descent brought me to Chesire MA and an ice cream shop followed by a hot street walk. The end of the hike entailed a long uphill climb which led to a very crowded shelter and campsite. I think there are at least 25 people here maybe more. I had a hard time finding a spot for my tent. My method for trying to stay cool on these really hot days is to dunk my bandana in a creek and drape it over my head. I also make sure I stay hydrated. The heat sucks your energy away quickly.

It was another warm morning with a climb to the top of Mt Greylock to start the day. After some photos I headed down the long descent. It was very hot walking through N Adams MA and then starting a long climb. The climb ended with a steep vertical through a jumble of boulders called the Rock Garden. It was a parting gift from MA just before I entered VT. On cue the trail became muddier and I can see how the state earned the name Vermud. Not as many in camp tonight which allowed me to get a decent place to set up my tent. Another hot day in the books and I had to hike a long time to get the miles in.

I asked what city and he said Duluth. I told him we were from Duluth and he asked my trail name and said he had heard of me. I had heard about him from someone about three weeks ago. A little while later another group came to the shelter and it turned out one of them was from Duluth. That made four of us from Duluth at one shelter. We had a great conversation about our favorite places and things to do in Duluth. We took a group picture and agreed to contact each other to get together next fall to compare stories. After hitting the trail again it got warm and we had a couple long steep hills to climb. Later in the day thunderstorms moved in and got us soaked.

Just before I got to the stream I was going to camp by something came running out of the woods right at me. When it was a few feet away I yelled and it turned away.

But I'm going to enjoy the milestone tonight. The day started with a climb up to a privately owned shelter that has a lookout built on top that provide great views. The trail had lots of hills both short and long. The saving grave was there were three chances to get ice cream not far from the trail. I went to a farm house owned by 2016 thru hikers and had a huge ice cream sandwich which was chocolate chips cookies with an inch of ice cream between.

I hiked south back toward the hostel after a 30 plus mile ride. This section of the Bigelow Mts is one of the last hard sections of ME. The views were 360 degrees and were spectacular. I could see all of flagstaff lake and many other distant lakes. The clouds were still hanging in the valleys which made for some good photos. I made the long hike in under 10 hrs. It would have taken me about 15 hrs with my full pack on. I'm still amazed at the kindness of strangers toward thru hikers. The trail community is so supportive and there are so many stories I hear and experience every day. Tomorrow I will receive more kindness with a ride back to where I started today.,"

This river is to wide and deep to ford and has power companies up river that do unannounced releases of water. The canoe ride was short and easy and it felt good to paddle a canoe even for a few minutes. Shortly after the ferry crossing I came to Caratunk ME where I stopped at a hostel for a pulled pork sandwich, milkshake and a small resupply. That afternoon had a climb up a smaller mt that had a great view and lots of blueberries. Late in the day, I saw two moose, cow and a calf in a swamp. It was another easier trail day.","

At the next river crossing I was trying to rock hop across when I hit a loose rock and fell getting my feet wet. Later that afternoon it started to rain quite hard and I noticed severe chafing as my shorts got wet. I was having a reaction to the laundry detergent from the hostel. I've seen it happen to two other hikers. When I got to the shelter the rash was pretty bad especially where my pack waist belt rubbed.

The first part of the trail was easy. Then it became steep folowed by some rock scrambling and climbing. After that I got above tree line and the wind started to push me around. I crossed an exposed ridge that was nerve racking and I was glad I couldn't see far ahead. After finally getting up the long ridge I came to the tablelands which are an easier hike. Another climb up an even windier slope brought me to the summit. I had a day hiker take a traditional picture of me on the summit sign. I almost got blown off but held on for a few photos. I was able to get a few glimpses of views from the top. As I began my descent the clouds cleared and I could see the beautiful views. I can see how this mt creates powerful emotions in thru hikers- - It is a very symbolic northern end of the trail. There was a lot of hikers heading up as I descended including a number of thru hikers I know. Handshakes and hugs were exchanged knowing we probably wouldn't see each other again.

ME had cooler weather, many more and larger water sources, relatively little urban noise, much less bug noise, much harder trail and far fewer day hikers. I'm not complaining, it's just very different. I thoroughly enjoyed the start of the hike in VA in the spring and the roughly 270 miles in the north half of the state.
I got a late start out of Daleville as I had to go to the post office to pick up my new shoes and wait for the outfitter to open at 10am to get stove fuel and a new food bag. I was hiking by 11am and it was already in the 80s with high humidity. I had a few hills to climb and was grateful for the switchbacks and smoother trail. I was rewarded with great views and was also able to dodge a rain shower under a rock overhang. I decided not to push too hard since I'm not used to the heat.

I waited for a few day hikers to finish their photo shoot and had one of them take my photo. The trail was well worn to the nearest parking lot about three miles away. The day was quite warm and humid and I didn't hike very fast in the afternoon. Outside of the day hikers going to McAfee Knob, I only saw four weekenders on the trail.

I hit the trail at first light and the day started with a long steep climb and descent of Pond Mt. On the other side, the trail followed a river for a while. It took a turn up a steep hill and I came to a spot where the trail split into four choices. I looked for a blaze but didn't see one so I started up the one that looked the most traveled. I soon ended up in a very steep rugged area that I could tell wasn't the trail. Many others had also taken this route. After climbing for a long time, I came to a trail with no blazes. I followed it for a while and came to the AT. After figuring out which was south, I was back in business. The rest of the day was uneventful, but my little jaunt through the woods wore me out. After I got my tent set up, it started raining so I cooked dinner in my tent vestibule. After cleaning up and putting stuff away, I fell asleep around 7pm.","

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603046,I woke up to an overcast morning. I packed up and was on the trail by first light. It started raining lightly about 11am but I was able to keep my feet dry which makes for much easier hiking. The trail had a few hills but was relatively easy. I got to the highway and walked a half mile to Station 19E Hostel. I will spend a few nights here while the remnants of Florence passed through. They have closed the AT in many areas in anticipation of lots of rain and wind.,"

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603085,It was a quiet morning as the others in the hostel slept past 9am. I was up by 7 on this rainy day and had breakfast and read the Duluth paper online. I also took an hour long nap in the morning. There is a bar below the hostel which was handy to watch football all afternoon. Its supposed to rain heavily tomorrow so I will wait until Tuesday to hit the trail again.,"

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603171,It wasn't as rainy as forecasted but I talked to a few hikers who said the trail was very wet in places. I think this area missed the brunt of the storm. I will be slackpacking tomorrow and then hit the trail with my big pack on Wednesday. I've been talking to my daughter and mom as I make plans for the end of the hike. They are going to meet me in GA and hike the last mile with me. We are planning to meet near Springer Mt on Oct 15. I'm really excited to be able to finish my hike with them.,"

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603223,Today was a slackpacking day. We got a ride from the hostel up into the Roan Highlands at Carvers Gap. There were four of us from the hostel and we started out with our daypacks on a foggy windy morning. The higher country was rocky with lots of standing and running water on the trail. The temps were cool which felt great after so many days hiking in the heat. I've heard the views are spectacular from up there but I could only see about 100ft. The tops of these mountains are mostly grassy balds. The sun started to peek out about the time I entered the green tumnel. It was a quick hike of just under 15 miles and I was rewarded with one nice view as I was about halfway down the mountain. I'm spending one last night at the hostel and will get dropped off at Carvers Gap in the morning to resume hiking south. The weather forecast looks good for a few days so hopefully the trail will dry out.,"Carvers Gap

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603317,The day started overcast but it burned off by mid morning. It ended up being great weather for hiking. We got dropped off in the same spot as yesterday but we hiked south today. The majority of the day was downhill which made for a more enjoyable day. I made it to the shelter by 5pm and decided to sleep in my tent. The days are getting much shorter so I have been getting up in the dark and packing up so I can start walking at first light.,"
",Cherry Gap Shelter,"Sep 19, Wed",19
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603321,I was up early and hiking by first light. It was a nice weather and I started with a pretty big hill. After a few ups and downs I came to a field with 360 degree views called Beauty Spot. The views were incredible with fog filling some of the valleys and the mountains sticking up. After that it was a really long downhill into Erwin and Uncle Johnnies Hostel. After a shower we got a shuttle to a Mexican restaurant and a resupply. Tomorrow's trail starts with a big hill and had lots of elevation change. It will be a hard day tomorrow.,"
",Uncle Johnnies Hostel Erwin TN,"Sep 20, Thu",17.10
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603515,I left Uncle Johnnies Hostel at first light and started up the big hill south of town. It seemed like it wouldn't end. It must have been all that Mexican food I are the night before. This day was really tiring with all the long hills. There were three that were 1-2 miles long that climbed 900-1200 ft in elevation. The shelter was over 5000ft in elevation and 3400 ft higher than the start. I've finally met up with some other sobo thru hikers. They are two pairs of flip floppers and I've been leap flogging with them for a week or two. Its nice to see familiar faces and have people at the shelters and hostels to talk to.,"
",Bald Mt Shelter,"Sep 21, Fri",16.80
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603516,The day started with a short climb up Bald Mt and I saw a sign for a bird banding project. Volunteers are collecting data on bird's that pass through the area. I talked to one guy who was excited to hear I was from Duluth. He was familiar with Hawk Ridge in Duluth and said they had caught some bird's banded at Hawks Ridge. It was an easier day than yesterday and I arrived at the shelter early. There were two people already there and two more I knew showed up. It was a full shelter and it rained on and off that night.,"
",Flint Mt Shelter,"Sep 22, Sat",19
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603518,I saw some familiar faces in the morning. I met a couple of section hikers that I had met at a hostel a couple weeks ago. They are finishing a few sections they had skipped a few years ago. The trail had a new section with some rocky climbs and a nice view. I also went through a meadow and got my feet soaked. Just before I was going to bed I heard a loud crack and saw another large tree come down about a hundred ft away. I've been pretty careful choosing my tent spots given all the trees I've watched fall on this trip,"
",Stealth Camp near Allen Gap,"Sep 23, Sun",18.20
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603519,I'm in another small town with a terrible cell signal. I didn't have a signal at any of my campsites the last four days. I'm sitting in front of the Welcome Center because the WiFi is so bad at my hotel. I made a quick trip to town today since it was mostly downhill. I had planned to zero tomorrow but will keep going because rain is coming Wednesday and Thursday. I will hike the next two days and zero on Thursday. I got new shoes today and am resupplied and ready to hit the trail early.,"
",Alpine Court Hot Springs NC,"Sep 24, Mon",15.40
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603627,I left the motel in Hot Springs at 7am and climbed a mile long steep hill to start the day. The next hill was over two miles long and gained 1600 ft in elevation. It was overcast and humid but I could feel the temp drop a few degrees as I gained elevation. The trail leveled off mid day and I arrived at a nice shelter and had it to myself. The two pairs I have been traveling with camped in front and behind me. Tomorrow's forcast calls for rain. I plan to get to Standing Bear Hostel to resupply and rest before entering the Smoky Mts.,"
",Roaring Fork Shelter,"Sep 25, Tue",18
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603632,"I was ready to hike at 7am but it was too dark and I had to wait about 20 minutes on this overcast morning. I climbed up to Max Patch Mt which has a meadow on top with great views to find a lot of people up there. To my surprise I found a wedding about to start. The east sky had a band of blue which allowed some great light for the pre wedding pictures. Not being an invited guest, I hiked on. I made good time up and down a few hills. It started to rain just before noon but the green tumnel kept me mostly dry. I arrived at the hostel just before 2pm and about a half hour before the heavy rain. There are some interesting people staying and working here. I will most likely take a zero tomorrow given the forecast for heavy rain.","
",Standing Bear Hostel,"Sep 26, Wed",15.40
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603683,"The much anticipated heavy rain did not hit us today. We watched it slide by west and north of us. It was still good to rest up for a final push to finish the last 240 miles. I was able to resupply, clean gear and eat lots of calories to get ready to hike through the Smoky Mts. I start with a large seven mile long hill in the morning. It will be a hard day but I'm looking forward to some beautiful country. I most likely won't be able to update this journal for about four days.","
",Standing Bear Hostel,"Sep 27, Thu",0
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603819,I left the hostel at first light on a wet drippy morning. The weather radar showed the rain had moved out and the forecast called for at least four days of clear weather. The plan was to try to get through Smoky Mt Nat Park in four days. I only had four days of food so I hope I can make it. I was traveling with the same four guys I had been seeing on the trail and in hostels for the past few weeks. This day would see lots of climbing as I hit a low of 1372ft in elevation and a high of 6302. We had a good evening meal the mogjt before and a day of rest so this day didn't seem too bad. The Smoky Mts lived up to their name with lots of smoke like fog. We camped at a shelter at 5900ft. Tomorrow would bring less climbing.,"
",Tri Corner Knob Shelter,"Sep 28, Fri",18.40
Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603821,"It was clear to start the day for a change. The trail had a number of short ups and downs. Around mid morning I came to an area that had many day hikers that were going to a popular overlook. As l hiked through that area I saw hundreds of people. On a sad note a hiker had been missing in this area since last Tuesday. She was last seen on a side trail near the AT in the Clingmans Dome area. After a long day we were at a shelter with a capacity of 12 and there were our usual five thru hikers and four other section hikers. Smoky Mt NP policy requires permits and reservations for section hikers. Thru hikers are required to but a twenty dollar permit. Section hikers 29th a specific shelter reservation can displace thru hikers in the shelter. The thru hiker then had to set up their tent. Just before dark a group of seven section hikers came to our shelter. After counting heads it was apparent that some of our group would have to vacate the shelter. After we set up our tents the entire group of seven section hikers decided to set up their tents in close proximity to us. As it turned out the shelter was half empty that night and the section hikers were loud, stayed up late talking loudly and snored all night.","

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603818,A short update....more later. We got to Clingmans dome around 9am to find no views on this foggy morning. The trail was very hard with lots of steep rocky hills. A big milestone today as I hit 2000 miles.

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603871,"I was on the trail by first light which is about 7:20am. The trail was much easier today 28th lots downhill but a couple big climbs. The end of the day was downhill with peeks of Fontana Lake. The trail crossed Fontanna Dan and lead to a really nice shelter called the Fontanna Hilton. It has a nearby shower, flush toilets and potable water. I have to resupply tomorrow and then it's a couple days on the trail to the next hostel. Time is winding down on this journey and I want to make the most of the time I have left.","

Ole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603960,"Sometimes you have to resupply somewhere close rather than trying to get to town. After leaving the Fontanna Hilton Shelter I stopped at the marina baitshop for a small resupply and a microwave sandwich. The choices for the resupply were slim and I was lucky I only needed another day and a half of food. Once back on the trail I hiked up a big hill. Overall it was a tough day with lots of shorter steep hills. I camped with two of the guys I've been hiking with and another section hiker. Tomorrow we head to the Nantahala Outdoor Center for a hostel stay, restaurant meal and resupply.","

After that it was a really long downhill to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. The NOC is located on a river and has a competition kayak course, rafting, adventure courses and is a outdoor medical training center. It also has restaurants, a store and a bar. It was nice to have a meal and a beer. I talked to my daughter and mom today. Details are almost complete for them to join me to hike the last mile on Oct 14.

There were a few more hills to climb before we reached our shelter. There was talk around camp tonight about the final resupply and hostel stops. Four of our group of five were here and discussed how we will be ending our hikes. Thoughts of home have been becoming more frequent as I hike during the day. I've even had dreams where I'm at home telling people I'm hiking the AT and need to get back to finish. I remember talking to other hikers when they were finishing up north and they said they had dreamt of home. I'm still having a good time and am looking forward to going into Franklin NC tomorrow for resupply and a hostel stay. After that it's only two more resupplies before the finish.","

The view was spectacular with distant mountains poking up through the low clouds. The days hike was fairly short and easy as we are making our last town stop. Franklin NC has a decent downtown with some good restaurants. We resupplied shortly after showers and laundry at the hostel. Dinner was like a home cooked meal at a local downtown restaurant.

The views showed how rugged this part of NC and GA are. I passed the 100 mile mark today and now have only 90 miles to go. I decided to go a little farther today after seeing a poorly trained dog at the shelter. The guys I've been hiking with are ahead of me so stealth camping was a good choice.,"

It was warm and humid with lots of wet weeds along side the trail to soak my shorts but I was able to keep my feet dry. The trail had a lot of short ups and downs but wasn't too hard. I saw many section and day hikers heading the other way. I ran into a thru hiker I had met in the White Mts in NH who flipped to Springer Mt to hike north because the trail was closed in N VA for week for Hurricane Florence. I stayed at a shelter with six section hikers and answered lots of questions about thru hiking. They don't see many thru hikers this time of year so are curious about our challenges.

It came down quite heavily so I went into the shelter and had breakfast. After the rain stopped I packed up the wet tent and hiked the short distance to the hostel. I got showered and had laundry done and then read for a couple hours. At 4pm we shuttled to town for dinner and resupply. I have about five days to cover 70 miles so it should be a fairly relaxed pace. The only problem may be remnants of Hurricane Micheal headed this way. Forecasts call for 1-2in of rain over Wed and Thur. Looks like I will be hiking in the rain for a couple of days. The forecast looks good for the end of the hike.,"

The wind was blowing hard and the trees were dripping. It was a long day of climbing and descending. I'm trying to get to Neel Gap tomorrow evening to avoid a day of rain.

I ate a pizza and took a shower and then hung stuff to dry. After I talked to my Mom on the phone a hawk tried to get a chipmunk and missed, crashing into the bushes. He then flew up to the rail of the deck and let me take several pictures before he flew away.

I arrived at the parking area and had a snack while waiting for my daughter and mom. They arrived about an hour later. It was so nice to see familiar faces. After hugs and news of their travels, we started up the trail toward the end. I had heard the final mile was easy but it was quite rocky. I knew we would gain 400ft in elevation over the mile but I didn't think the trail would be so rough. My 82 yr old mother did really well taking it slow and careful and climbing all the way to the top. I was surprised at how emotional I got at the top as memories of all the hard work to get here came flooding back. We took pictures and talked to other hikers and took more pictures. It was a wonderful end to the hike of a lifetime. We now had the task of going back down the steep rocky trail. We made it without mishap as my Mom did a great job of making her way down. It was fun to run into three other thru hikers finishing their treks. We saw one on the way up and two on the way down. They also had family hiking with them and their excitement was infectous. This day was a perfect way to end my long journey.","
