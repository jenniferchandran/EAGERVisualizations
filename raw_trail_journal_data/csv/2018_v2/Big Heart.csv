Big Heart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539684,"Hi Everyone,Wow, ok, so I'm going to NoBo thru-hike the AT. Even more exciting? I'm going to do it with my little brother! Going end-to-end has been a dream of mine for a while and I'm finally going to turn that dream into reality. For most of my life I've walked the straight and narrow, lived life by-the-book, 4 yr college degree after h.s., worked a job in the city, etc etc ...but not anymore. The wilderness is calling, I can hear her singing sweet songs in my ear. I'm using this journal to keep track of my journey, both pre-hike and on the trail. Looking forward to the planning process, figuring out the logistics of this hike is like a christmas for my brain ha! I'm using a trail name given to me by some day-hiking friends who found out that I work in the non-profit world helping children, they said it fit. That being said, I'm looking forward to earning a new one on the AT 2018, seems like a long ways away! With wild delight,","

Big Heart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540034,"I'm starting the nuts and bolts planning and my first step it to create a budget - I've read that planning for $1000/mo is about average..I wonder what others have budgeted if different from that. Part of the budget will be the various permits that are required throughout the trip, a process that seems all too complicated. You would think there would be a website to visit where you could enter your trip details and it would spit out the permits required and even allow you to purchase and print them. But hey, maybe I just haven't found that yet! Anyways, so far I have determined the following permits will be required..Camping Permits..-Great Smoky Mountains-Shenandoah-Baxter and Smokies overnight camping reservations? -White Mountain advanced hut reservationsGoing to devote some more research to this until I have a clearer picture.With wild delight,","

Big Heart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541825,"I decided that I wanted to plan our hike using a combination of things, two of my favorite planning tools though are the AT Thru Hiker's Companion Guide and my National Geographic Appalachian Trail Wall Map! (I can't tell which picture is going to go with this post - so it's either a picture of the map, or a picture of Matt making coffee with a french press on the trail) I'll be going through the Companion Guide this weekend, I hope to have all of Georgia planned out by the end of the weekend. Heading to Red River Gorge soon to get some miles in, looking forward to that. I picked up a new tent the other day, bought a REI Camp Dome 2, it will do for now. With Wild Delight,","
