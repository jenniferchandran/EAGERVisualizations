charmedlife,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582134,"So i spent yesterday practicing hanging my bear bag in the park, (You hang your food in a tree so the bears won't eat it, and you don't want it in your tent because the bear(s) will come into your tent to eat and ruin a good night's sleep!)  Anyway, it's much trickier than I thought but with great encouragement and practice I think I have it figured out!   Still very excited to get on the trail and get this party started!

Cheers!",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Mon",0

Hard to believe this phase is ending so a new phase can begin.  It's been especially hard leaving my patients and friends at work. I am always amazed at their willingness to share their stories with me and now I get to share my story with them.  
I hope it gets warmed so I can dial in my gear and get my body better prepared for this journey.  
I am so excited!",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Mon",0
charmedlife,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582702,"SO i forgot that over the weekend I picked up my new sleeping bag.  SO pretty pink on the outside and yellow on the inside!  Talk about warm!  It's actually a quilt and not a sleeping bag, I will use it in my hammock along with an underquilt to help keep me warm on those cold nights esp in the beginning.  I have my hammock fly and bug screen to keep me dry and bug free at night too.  Hope the hammock will let me sleep warm and dry above the ground that may have rocks and rain water.  More on that as I get to try it out when it get warmer!",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Mon",0
charmedlife,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583925,"Well hard to believe time is going by so fast,  I keep hiking, making  and sewing things to make the trip more pleasant trying to combat what I keep hearing and reading that the trail will be difficult and hard.  I don't think I would be attempting this trail if it were easy for sure.  What I have learned even without stepping foot on the trail is that I have an amazing group of family and friends that are cheering for and love me more than I already knew.  My life is really amazing and such a gift. I got this bracelet as a token to take with me on the trail and it means so much to me, i also got a chunk of petrified wood and lucky charms to bless me on my my way.  
As for my gear, that's an on-going process of modifying and adjusting things and I know sure as anything I will continue to make adjustments along the way, some for necessity, other changes just for the fun of it!

I am working on my food list, without a doubt I am more than little nervous about getting enough to eat and liking the food that's in my pack.  A dear friend of mine, reminded me to eat my favorite foods first, hopefully they will all be my favorites!   I am workign hard to develop a taste for canned tuna but its coming along slowly (read not at all!) Protein will likely be a mix of peanut butter, cheese, pepperoni, bacon and beans! 
Well more to come!","

charmedlife,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584585,"Slept at the Max Epperson shelter during a rainy cool night.  We started out at 10 am, kinda rainy day, ate oatmeal and off we went. The climbs were tough but we were tougher. My partner left me at at Springer after hiking more than 8 miles to catch a shuttle at 630 pm and I was terribly sad and tearful but I knew it was how is was supposed to be. I had a touch of Jameon’s and crawled into my hammock. It was crazy windy nightwith winds up to 35 mph  A dog started yelping at 4am and I was convinced it was a bear but apparently not. Tomorrow i get to start my dream hike!","AT Visitor Center

charmedlife,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586295,Sorry for not journaling lately but I hadn’t had much energy or service plus I couldn’t log in but alas I think I have it worked out now!  I hope to transfer my old entries when i have  the chance So I’ve hiked for 6 days straight and my dogs are barking.  Funny my body feels great but my feet.  Oh my feet! I think they just need a rest.  I think it’s time for a zero.  I stayed at the Fontana lodge last night and enjoyed a big fluffy bed and a lengthy shower!!! I’ve been pretty emotional lately and I think it’s from the trail and fatigue but it’s been an adventure as I thought it would be for sure  The smokies are next and I’m more than a little concerned but the weather looks to be sunny for the next few days but then rain for the weekend.  Hope not to be too cold while I’m high in the mountains!!  One day at a time for sure!,"Hotel
